Feeling that public opinion only can triumphantly carry such a

PEEEACE.
A publication advocating law reform as to conveyancing has no
need of an apology.
The author will feel amply rewarded if his treatise can be con-
sidered as useful, in some small degree, by way of reference to
the various points of view, under which the subject may be considered,
by various portions of the reading public.
At the desire of some friends of learned research, the historical
sketch (exhibiting the ancient publicity of dealings and the later
origin of private conveyancing), and at the wish of others an exposi-
tion of the French notarial office and system of hypotheques were
first committed to the press, occupying a more prominent position
perhaps, than what their contents may warrant. These preconcerted
arrangements could not have been altered without materially increasing
the expense.
The practical reader may readily turn to the systems which
undoubtedly are entitled to the greatest attention of the civilized
world generally, and of the colonies in particular—the systems of
registration obtaining in America, Belgium, and other similarly
constituted communities. These are recapitulated (in comparison
with the French) in the fourth part.
The American system will be found on page 52, 58, the Belgian
and Dutch on page 55, that of the Hanse Towns on page 63.
Whatever the reader’s impressions may be on other parts, it is
impossible that the French regulations of the notarial office (page 33)
could be lost on the public mind.
It will also not be overlooked that some of the practical dangers
of deeds without registration are proved on page 56, while the


general absurdities of the system and the aggregate of costs which it
inflicts on the community are exhibited in the second part.
A review of the system of registration now in force in South
Australia is given from page 70 to page 7 5, coupled with particulars
of statistics.
The most recent proposals of Government are briefly reviewed from
page 75 to 78.
On the last pages Mr. Torrens’ proposals are exhibited in their
principles and leading features, with a view to contribute to a more
complete and efficient discussion by others.
The author would, nevertheless, trust that his effort to refer even
to remote antiquity will not be misunderstood.
Since the English branch of the legal profession take up their
stronghold in mystery and complication, it was necessary to prove
from antiquity that they have not made the best selection.
Antiquity proves that publicity in dealings with lands was the
first and the true English principle, and private conveyancing a
deviation resorted to under circumstances which have ceased to exist.
The conviction cannot possibly be lost on the most influential
members of the English legal profession themselves, that in the
practice of conveying by deed the plainest and most useful principles
of antiquity are lost sight of, and some of the most absurd and
obnoxious retained.
The encouragement also we have drawn at the conclusion from the
state of the question in Britain, cannot fail to attract much notice.
We have not reprinted the lawyers’ bills at great length. This
omission the public will pardon, partly because the items are
unintelligible, and partly because there can be no mistake as to the
amount.
We have also abstained from stating cases of litigations, losses,
and sorrows arising to parties when swindled out of their property
under the existing unsatisfactory method. This omission, if wanted,
may however be supplied through the medium of the newspapers.

INTRODUCTION.
Although amongst the nations of Christendom, the British stands
high as having been the first to dismiss the notion of property in
human beings: our laws on landed property still betray their
origin to have sprung from views which the conquering took, and
to which the conquered were obliged to submit.
But inasmuch as we do think proper to make our dealings con-
sonant to principles such as we admit to be intrinsically just and
general, we shall as certainly have to reform both law and practice
in respect of land.
If, indeed, from the nature of immoveable property, a necessity
could be shown to complicate its forms and involve its law in per-
plexity, then that necessity must have been operating, in all ages
and countries, as mischievously as with us. But why should fair
lands, ours, at least, which are bought at public sales, be a subject
of perplexity ? Still, is there a nation on the face of the earth now,
or has there ever been a nation, subject to distinction raised upon
distinctions, so as we are, in respect of our lands ? Beason and
History prove the negative in answer to these questions.
Shall we listen to reason 1 That distinction of our law in which is
the most powerful root of all this perplexity—and upon which that
other most gigantic evil, the duplicity of legal and equitable jurisdictions
and estates is mainly raised— is the distinction between a free-
hold and inferior tnterest in lands. Now, reason pronounces it
to be a distinction “as marked as it is unfounded in the nature
op things.” This is a quotation from “ A Practical Treatise on the
Analogy between Legal and Equitable Estates, by Henry Tickling,
Esq.”* That distinction being unfounded in nature, it follows that,
so far, at least, as the rules of personal property are applicable to
one kind of interest in lands, they ought to be considered as appli-
cable equally well to the other kind. All the learning, ingenuity,
and practical experience employed in a structure, raised on a foun-
dation which nature repudiates, are but spent amiss, and, instead of

properly protecting and usefully fostering legitimate enterprise, in-
dustry, and business, can but involve our transactions, retard our
progress, and undermine our successes.
There is one distinction indeed founded in nature between im-
moveable and moveable objects of property. It is this, that these,
from their fluctuating and perishable nature, are not so directly
subject “as immoveables are” to be made the permanent means for
devices either of tyranny or overbearing polity and greed, or, at
other times, of lawful family convenience, credit, co-operation, and
government. Now all in this colony will agree, that families may
settle possessions in whatever way they please, so, however, that the
principles of our public constitution are not thereby endangered.
So also, that wherever lands are desirable for lawful and laudable
enterprise, nothing ought to be allowed to stand in its way, and that
dealings on credit ought to be as secure as the value of the land.
So also that government, founded on principles just and well-suited
to the requirements of the commonwealth, ought to have their cer-
tain remedy and sure hold on every permanent possession, alike for
the purposes of justice, peace, and public safety, and generally for
the maintenance of the true national polity. Thus far, then, but no
further under any circumstances, ought a free people to allow any
hold on their lands to take place in the law.
In the reformatory measure now before the House of Assembly
that principle is realised, in the strength of which this precise boun-
dary line, guarding the public concerns without encroachment on
liberty, can alone be kept. It is its most distinguishing feature that
it maintains the authority of the British Crown, in granting the
standard assurance as the constant means of recording before the
public the ownership and interests of all in lands, directly from and
immediately under the British Crown, in loyalty, legality, and inte-
grity. Our leading journal has very aptly termed this idea grand
in its simplicity.
Its justice cannot possibly be denied upon general reasons. It is
the majesty of the law only by which the character of right is
impressed on ownership and all interests ; hence ownership cannot
create a claim, as of its own right, to effectuate changes. It is the
law which effectuates the change ; the lawgiver therefore acts in his
own authority, in prescribing such forms as will secure the perma-
nently authenticated and useful character of the manner of changing.
And there is no means of obtaining that security, except by lodging
the authority, not with any interested classes, but with public func-
tionaries only, as being responsible to the people. If, in the admi-
nistration of any public concern, interested classes prevail, its per-
version is sure to be engendered one way or other.
Thus, while reason demands, it also points out the measure of


reform. Nothing short of it will do. But while reason maintains
its principle, history attests its strength, and experience approves it
as being thoroughly practical.
History bears testimony to its strength; and the experience of
British colonies and foreign nations demonstrates not merely its
practicability as a distant prospect, but its approved practical useful-
ness as a matter of fact.
True history is proved from contemporaneous documents; such
therefore are dwelt upon at some length in the following pages.
But the general outline of her testimony on these subjects may here
be sketched, as the exposition of the plan of this treatise.
When chivalry conspired with the Church, the military interest
became paramount. It was not before the 11th century (in many
parts of Europe much later) that ancient freedom, the groundwork
of German institutions, became almost totally merged in feudalism.
Allodial owners, to escape withal, had to fortify themselves in
boroughs and cities. In England even such were obliged to do
homage; but in the Netherlands, France, and the German empire,
they gathered in their strongholds in great numbers and forces for
some centuries. Their industry gave them power. In process of
time, when commerce diffused wealth, the views and arrangements
of allodial original proved their inexhaustible vigour in thriving
colonies in a new world. Being much left to themselves, the colo-
nists enacted the plain principles of which the notions were tra-
ditionary, by usage, in obscure municipalities or boroughs from
whence they had come—and the effect was as might have been
expected, plain principles created plain practice. It is to such
channels we must look for an explanation of the striking marks of
relationship which some systems of transfer in America bear to
coutumes in France, and partly to ancient Saxon usages. These
gave satisfaction to the colonies, and facilitated greatly the astonishing
rapidity of their development—long, indeed, unnoticed and unheeded
by Europe in her pride. There by that time the cities of the Con-
tinent had seen their liberties sunk and ruined at last in the
unequal contest; while only very few of the once powerful Hanseatic
league, and the Netherlands, maintained their integrity; and the Eng-
lish nobility and commonalty shook off the oppressions, but not the
forms of feudalism. At length in France the tiers-etat taking fierce
revenge, buried the whole of the gilded fabric of feudalism under the
ruins of a sanguinary revolution, and, on the ruins, proclaimed the pro-
hibition for ever of any revival of either feudalistic forms or principles.
Instead of them the lawgiver re-established, in his civil code, the
principles and forms of property on a basis of reason and practical
utility. To do this, he had recourse to the same principle of pub-
licity of dealing with immoveables, which in remote times rude
settlers had practised, and which exiles and adventurers had carried


into tlie backwoods of America. That principle has thus proved its
strength and vitality to outlive the severest tests, under the most
adverse circumstances in history, that could have befallen its
exercise.
Its practical advantages are such as to give satisfaction to the par-
ties chiefly interested everywhere where the system has had fair
scope. A transfer in Hamburg costs from one to six shillings; in Canada
about fifteen shillings. The citizen of the former place never thinks
of employing a lawyer to transfer premises or secure an investment;
between the secretary of the city and the sworn brokers of “immove-
ables’* (Erben), the matter is managed with safety and dispatch.
Deeds are unknown, and bad titles are unknown too ; in fact, they
cannot happen : the principle being, by the Citizens’ Statute, “ that
there can be no evidence above the evidence of “ the City’s Book of
Immoveables” (Stadt-Erbe-Buch). Hence parties take care to
adjust their differences, because without it no new name is admitted
on the book. Mortgages also are unknown, for investments there
are plain money charges, entered in the simplest form imaginable
and certified on demand.
Advocates of private transfers have described the transfer “by
book,” as a mere inferior mechanical process, far beneath comparison
with the scientific character of the achievements of refined con-
veyancing. But to make such boasting good, they should prove—
first, that ingenuity in linking together absurdities is science ; se-
condly, that science teaches, and confers an exclusive right, to make
people pay five or fifteen guineas, when a much better assurance can
be established at from one shilling to fifteen shillings.
Delenda est Carthago.—Reform in this matter must be obtained
and be radical. No admission of half measures, no sanction to clap-
traps. Men of integrity and talent—such as adorn the Bar of South
Australia —will, by such a reform, be placed in a position to obtain
that influence which is their proper due. Then eloquence shall
grace, and perspicuity of exposition shall support integrity, know-
ledge, and application; then shall these solid virtues obtain that
ascendancy which the people will not, as hitherto the exhibitions of
impenetrable argument, applaud with doubtful wonder, but really
value for its usefulness and appreciate for its merit.
The plan of this treatise, as exhibited in the preceding table of
contents, will now readily be understood, as will also the sallies the
author has occasionally indulged in, not at learning, talent, diligence,
and skill, but at illgotten privilege, abuse of the public, and wrong
to the individual.


PART I
THE ANGLO-SAXON,
THE FEUDALIST,
AND MODERN CONYETANCER.
CHAPTER I,
THE ANCIENT SAXON LAW ON LANDED PROPERTY.
In primitive Saxon simplicity the principles of the law, affecting the
free man’s lands, were certainly very plain, just, and comprehensive;
and even generally their laws are admitted by the learned, to have
been framed with more regard than that of most other contemporaneous
nations for individual rights, and with a deep and bold conception of
certain elements in the constitution, well adapted to secure public
interests and to encourage co-operation. Concomitant with the
Norman conquest (a.d. 1066.) a superstructure was raised, as unjust
in its beginnings as it was oppressive in its details. The nation
struggled, partly evaded, ultimately shook off the more mischievous
incongruities (by the statute 12 Charles 11. a.d. 1660, near 600 years
after the conquest). Exulting in this, they allowed the rubbish of re-
mains to become, as it were, a tertiary formation, disjointed, incoherent,
mouldering, decomposing : yet a valuable quarry to the parties who
profess to understand its every fragment. The age, however, being
pregnant with life and liberty : the present generation is prompted by
nature herself to exhibit her powers. We cannot form colonies on
uncertain foundations, on rubbish and on shifting sands. We must
allow the roots of our institutions to strike deeper than the mouldering
decomposing tertiary formation, so as to take a firm hold in the
first firm principles of the ancient Saxon times.


SECTION I.
The Principle Constitutionally Considered.
The monuments, numerously extant, of the manner in which the
ancient Saxons legislated on landed property, and frequently trans-
acted business in respect of it, prove their view of a freeman’s
property in lands to have been plain, comprehensive, and just.
Their lands were originally not feudal, but allodial; in other
words they were not held from a military superior, in a stipendiary
point of view, but occupied with complete and exclusive right by the
owner and his heirs. Their kings neither had, nor claimed any
'property in the lands of the subject, as such. Their chieftains
and noblemen of renown were on a footing of equality, and the very
numerous class of their great and valiant men represented landed
possessions rather than hereditary dignity. Their first kings cer-
tainly were no more than war-kings, whose authority ceased with
the war : there being an authority both anterior to them, and more
permanently vested, in their national councils—the “ witena-gemot ,” or
“meeting of the wise.” In such witena-gemots the Saxons had
their first shares in their commonwealth adjusted, in point of pro-
perty as well as of possession, of dignity, and of burden.
The sturdy Saxons, though very far from holding communistic
views, were a people eminently given to meet together and devise
anything and everything, under some point of view or other, as a
matter of public interest. If the “ hundred” had anything to settle,
there must be held a 11 folk-gemot,” which is, a meeting of the people.
If it concerned parties or interests in several hundreds, a meeting
had to be appointed (as the case might be) of two, three, eight ox-
more hundreds. As for the earl, he must be sure to meet the shire
at stated times. And as for the whole of the tribe, there was never
a Saxon, but he could see, that matters could not go well at all,
except it be so, that their wisest men (witena) must needs meet
together, from all their variegated ranks and possessions, once or
twice at the least in every year. And this they managed to do
(their fightings and quarrels notwithstanding) mostly about the
times of the great festivals, interspersed with frequent convivialities.
blow, besides this, the Saxons have also in all ages been a people
very fond of land and landed property qualifications, somehow. No
wonder then that they made their manifold meetings the means, from
the beginning, for adjusting their interests in land.
This they did even in the depths of their German forests. Much
more so when they had come into the fair British island, where
cultivated farms, and villages, and noble cities, and castles, and
mines, with cattle and bondsmen in abundance, fell to their lot.
They used at their meetings to settle all these things not only by
deciding between man and man in case of disputes, but chiefly and
principally by making their transactions known in the audience of


their people, and in that way authenticated and valid according to
their law. Its most distinguishing feature was then, and has always
been, wherever Saxons had it their own way, that transactions
affecting lands must be public and notorious, and attested to at the
people’s ordinary meeting, in order to be valid.
Their constituted ordinary jurisdictions for this, as we noticed
before, were the hundred and the shire. To these meetings of the
hundred and the shire all free men were wont to resort, indeed their
law obliged them from remotest antiquity to do so at stated times ;
these resorts were therefore public to all in the fullest extent.
Moreover, as it is quite sure that their law has never recognised any
transfer of land at all except by way of such a public transaction ;
another very important consequence was this, that it led them to a
constant habit of pointing out the specific objects of transfer on
such occasions very distinctly, leaving, on the other hand, any lands
not specifically mentioned necessarily free and unaffected. A
principle this, which in process of time has become a powerful means
for maintaining the system of transfers in land under Saxon law in
great integrity, simplicity, clearness, and efficiency.
In these respects therefore, the Saxon law from its beginning has
had the advantages of great consistency and strength over the
Roman law (which admits of private transfers and innumerable
latent charges on immoveables), and even over the customs of those
venerable eastern nations of old, who, in the gates of their cities, met
for the purposes both of justice and of business occasionally, but were
neither so constant nor so strict as the Saxons have been in forming
the advantages of this habit of publicity in such matters into a
permanently useful and practical system.
Nevertheless it is highly interesting to compare the coincidence of
the eastern customs in this respect with those of the ruder northern
settlers. Let us turn for a moment then from the German forests
and the hall of old English oak, to glance at the details of a trans-
action under the gates of Israel. For at our distant age we should
hardly understand how this principle could have worked at all before
the appliances of writing in such things, were it not even for those
details which may very opportunely, for this purpose, be drawn from
the Sacred Volume.
We need scarcely remind our readers, who are familiar with the
Scriptures, that we might easily quote from a great many passages
such as Deuteronomy xxv. 7, 9 j Prov. xxxi. 23; Jeremiah xxxii. 12 ;
Genesis xxiii. 17, 18. One passage from the book of Ruth, however,
may suffice, not only as characteristic and highly creditable to the
nation whose records it contains, but also as particularly illustrating
the certainty and correctness of dealing which this principle involves.
After certain events we read that Naomi foresaw and told virtuous
Ruth that the man Boaz would not be in rest “ until he have
finished this thing this day.”


The narrative goes on to say : —“ Then went Boaz up to the gate,
and sat him down there : and, behold, the kinsman, of whom Boaz
spake, came by ; unto whom he said, Ho, such an one ! turn aside,
and sit here. And he turned aside and sat down. And he took ten
men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they
sat down. And he said unto the kinsman : Naomi, that is come
out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land which was our
brother Elimelech’s. And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy
it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people. If
thou wilt redeem it, redeem it : but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
tell me that I may know : for there is none to redeem it besides
thee; and lam after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
Naomi, thou must buy it also of Euth the Moabitess, the wife of
the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar
mine own inheritance : redeem thou my right to thyself; for I
cannot redeem it.
Now this was the manner in former times in Israel concerning
redeeming and concerning changing; for to confirm all things a man
plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour ; and this was a
testimony in Israel. Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it
for thee. So he drew off his shoe.
And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people,
Ye are witnesses that I have bought all that ivas ElimelecE s, and all
that was Chilian's, and Mahloris, of the hand of Naomi.
Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased
to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance;
that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his
brethren, and from the gate of his place. Ye are witnesses this day.
And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are
witnesses. The Lord make the woman that has come into thine house
like Kachel and like Leah.”
In the same manner as the testimony in Israel was, by taking off
the sandal or oriental slipper, the northern nations handed over a
green hough, a twig, or a turf; but whether the symbol consisted in
the shoe or the turf it is easy to see that the main point in view
was the publicity of the act, giving notice to any such parties as
might claim an interest, and the public approval and evidence to be
gained in this way. But in order to exemplify this principle more
fully now, we must return to our Anglo-Saxon ancestors.
SECTION 11.
True Nature of the Original Estate of the English in their Lands,
and the Form of the Transfers.
The Anglo Saxons, as we have shown generally, had not their lands
in the form of a military stipend from any superior; they held in


virtue of the several occupations of the families taken up and agreed
to in the public councils of their freemen, when the tribe as a whole,
but by succcessive reinforcements of warriors, arrogated the country
to themselves and established the Seven Kingdoms. With all their
public spirit they had no leaning towards communism. The free
Saxon took his lands directly as his own (eigen) as the freeman’s
home and immediate possession, and exclusively to support himself
and his, having due regard, however, to his kindred. In fact the
Saxon to this day, if he has the chance at all of doing it in this
way, is far too acute and thrifty a person to do it in any other way.
On the other hand, bare occupancy without plain and manifest
right, such as accorded with their national views on rectitude, would
have been abomination in the sight of their wise men. Hence their
individual possessions most certainly were subject from the beginning
to such forms of the law as were made and agreed to among themselves.
From these twin sources, then, arose many very marked differences
of the true English Law from the impositions afterwards rapaciously
superimposed on the people, much against their will, by the subtilty
of the Herman lawyers. The more important of these differences
may readily be enumerated.
First—ln Saxon descent there was no law of primogeniture. The
males of every family (being the defenders of the same), distinguished
by the name of Sword-kinsmen (Schwerd Magen) concurred according
to their acknowledged degrees of consanguinity, in the succession to
any of the lands the family had originally taken ; hence these were
as frequently subdivided as re-united into fewer hands. In moveables
the softer sex was more favoured; they were also carefully provided
for in marriage, if in any way the circumstances of the family would
admit of this.
Secondly: even the female sex was in no wisejahsolutely excluded from
the ownership of lands. So many proofs occur of their being allowed
to possess, to inherit and transmit landed property, as to put all notions
of exclusive military tenure out of the question.
Thirdly—The Anglo-Saxon owner made oyer the lands to any one
who would bargain for the same with him or her: by handing over
the turf or twig directly to the purchaser before the open meeting of the
hundred or the shire, provided this was not there and then spoken
against by his next of kin, or any other freeman claiming under some
previous gift, absolutely or for life, or upon expressed conditions.
These stated meetings, as we have seen, being necessarily attended
to by all, were always ready to furnish the “ witnesses ” on former
transactions, but if absent, time was allowed to bring them. Very
many documents show that business of this sort was oftener trans-
acted in an amicable way at their meetings, than by decisions on
opposing claims.
A few observations on this point may be usefully condensed.


The effect of delivery of the symbol of the land before the proper
meeting, if there and then passed without being spoken against,
could not afterwards be shaken ; this, as the general principle of
the Saxon law, is most certainly true. To mitigate its strictness
there were exceptions, such as admitting the heir to claim within a
year and a day, or to make proclamation at three meetings and one
time over (equivalent to a year and a day), &c., &c., under certain
regulations. But never once have the Saxon people allowed
clandestine transactions to take effect instead of public ones, nor
admitted of expedients to set the proper jurisdictions aside. There
were some courts of the manor, certainly, even then, but these were
created with advice and consent of the national witenagemot and
proceeded among their tenants just upon the same principle as the
hundreds did with the free men. The tenant of the manor, then,
as now, delivered his twig to the lord of the manor, and the lord or
steward delivered it to the new tenant; but the freeman gave the
Symbol of his allodial lands directly to the purchaser in the presence
of the judge (earl or greve) and the people—and not to the judge.
A sure proof this is that the earl and greve presided over the shire and
hundred in their capacity as magistrates and not as lords. Still, the
free Saxon man never sought to hand the symbols of his lands
over in any way but in the audience of the shire—or folkgemot, and
bare corporeal tradition of allodial lands would be of no avail
whatever in the eyes of Saxon folks—a sure proof that although they
scornfully rejected all thoughts of holding their land from superiors,
they had their jurisdictions purposely arranged in the manner we
have described : for the opportunity which was thereby held out to all
that might claim to guard their rights and interests in the lands.
There cannot be greater eulogium passed on a nation, so proud of
their individual freedom, than that of being so willing to deal only
under the public eye by the direction of their law, which they
themselves had freely agreed to.
Fourtldy —These authenticated deliveries before the folks were
always accompanied with words expressive of the quantity , conditions,
and limitations of the estate, and by no means confined to mere or
absolute transfers by sales. Estates of inheritance, possessions for
life or lives, remainders, as contingencies, were in very early times
distinctly provided for by the words attached to the delivery.
Fifthly —Writings were often added by way of continuing the
“witness.” The documents extant from the Anglo-Saxon period,
are remarkable for brevity and for being clearly and forcibly drawn.
This arose from their being the product, not of the verbosity of scho-
lastic clerks, but the true counterpart of the words the people were
wont to employ in their oral gifts at their meetings. Being constantly
in the habit of either witnessing or judging in such matters, they
well new the import of their words uttered on such occasions, and took


care to say only what they knew would secure the end in view, and
to say no more.
As for the identity of the persons the question could seldom arise.
Parties were obliged to appear personally or through certain proxy—•
of which we shall adduce an instance. But Saxons generally were
in the habit of making their own words and transacting their own
business themselves; the principle of their law books in this respect
being, that a man may have or may not have a pleader or proxy, at
his own pleasure and peril, but if he engages one, and is present, may
take the matter out of his hand, and conduct it himself whenever he
thinks proper. The Saxon could not be forbidden therefore, to entrust
the conducting of his transaction to any friends, who would do it for
him.
Their judicial proceedings of every sort, as well as pleadings, were
regulated under a system of pecuniary mulcts for controvening the
order or customs of their courts —which however could not be inflicted
without a special finding of the “ folk.” So there was no tyranny in
this.
Having thus endeavoured to state the most striking peculiarities
of the ancient English system, we proceed to exhibit some interesting
details.

Illustrations of Various Estates.
1. Estates of inheritance.
Whenever more than life estates were meant, words of perpetuity
were used. But as these were devisable in two ways (either with,
or without consent of the kindred) words having reference to this
also were usually employed.
From a very early period (between a.d. 691 and 694) we have
the following—
I, Hodilredus, the kinsmen of Sabbi, in the Province of the East
Saxons, with his consent, of my own will, in sound mind, and by
rightful advice, for ever deliver unto thee, and from my right set
over into tliine, the land, &c., with all things belonging to it, with the
fields, wood, meadows, and marsh, that as well’ thou as thy posterity
may hold, possess, and have free power to do with the land whatsoever
thou wilt” In these words we recognise the absolute allodial pro-
perty.
About the same time, a.d. 704, the king thus expresses himself: —
“ This land we deliver to be possessed in ownership by the said
bishop, &c., in perpetual right, and that he may have the free power
of doing with it whatsoever he will.”
On other occasions the words run to such effect as tliis :
That it may be in his power, and may remain firmly fixed in
hereditary right; which might be thought to have reference to the
rights of the kindred. But along with words of inheritance, the
absolute power to devise is often plainly expressed, e.g., “to have and


possess it, and for his days to enjoy it happily, and after his days to
leave it to whomsoever shall he agreeable to him in everlasting inheri-
tance.”
Another, A.D. 756, “I will give it to him for ever that he may
have it as long as he lives, and after that time that he may leave it
to any person he shall please to be possessed in hereditary right
or plainer still; “ that he may have the liberty of giving or changing
it in his lifetime, and may have the power of leaving it after his death
to whomsoever he will." Now all the above are instances of absolute
transfers.
In the following case it must be borne in mind that the manor
had to be given in the way prescribed for considerations of relation-
ship.
A king gives a manor to Edred to give it to Lulla and Sigethryth,
who are enjoined to give a certain part of the land to Aulf and
Herwin ; but Aulf was to give half of this part to Biamulf, and to
enjoy the other half for his own life, with the power of devising it as
he pleased.
The term to give, in the Anglo-Saxon, means to deliver and to
make over.
2. Life Estates and Remainders.
We find as often cases in which it is expressed, that the
person to whom an estate was passed in the first instance for his
own life, should have the power of transferring it to any certain
number (one, two, three, or more) of his heirs after him, after whose
lives it should revert in some cases to the original proprietor, in
other cases to some ecclesiastical body, sometimes to some individual
mentioned in the gift by name.
We will give only one instance—
A.D. 984, Oswald gave to his kinsman Eadwig and his wife three
manses for their lives. If the husband survived her, he was to be
deemed the first heir of the land, or if she survived, she was to be the
first heir. They were empowered to leave all to their offspring if
they had any, if not, then the survivor was to leave it to any two
heirs whom he pleased, but no further.
3. Charges.
Lands were also charged in this way. Instances of this occur
sometimes under the name of gafol land ; sometimes as pure leases.
Thus Archbishop Aeldulf, a.d. 996, gave land to a dliegn for his
life and two heirs, but annexed a condition that they should provide
every year fifteen salmon.
An ancient lease is mentioned in a.d. 852, by which Kedred,
abbot of Middeshamstead and the monks let (lead) to Wulfred, the
land at S. for her life, on condition that she gave, besides some other
land, a yearly rent of sixty fother of wood, twelve do. of coals, six do,
of turf, two tuns full of clear ale, two slain cattle, 600 loaves, ten mitten
of Welsh ale, one horse, thirty shillings, and a night’s lodging.


It is a very remarkable feature of the Saxon law, that such
charges were not at all considered as necessarily repugnant to estates in
perpetuity and inheritance , for we find it stated that iEthelbald, king
of the Mercians, had granted to Eanulf, grandfather of Off A, an
estate of inheritance, burdened with an annual payment of coal, ale,
corn, and other provisions for a royal villa; and this estate, with the
rent charges attached to it, Offa afterwards gave in remainder to
the See of Worcester, after his own life and that of his sons.
How vastly superior the application of this principle is to our
cumbrous machinery of mortgaging, we have pointed out in the
introduction. Here we will only add one proof that Anglo-Saxons
knew how to distinguish clearly between promises (as matter of
pe'rsonal contract) and gift or delivery, as the means to set over the
estate, or right real, from one owner to another.
We can do this with a perfect good grace by showing :
How—about A.D. 1000 — a Saxon bridegroom provided for the lady of his heart.
“There appears in this Writing the compact which Wulfric and the Archbishop
made, when he obtained the Archbishop’s sister for his wife. It is: that he peomised
her the land at Ealretune and at Bebbetforda for her life, and peomised her the land at
Knightwick, that he would obtain it for her for the lives of three men from the
monastery at Winchelcumbe. And he gave hee the land at Eanulflnton (so as) to
give to her and to grant to those that were dearest to her during life, and after her life
to those that were dearest to her. And he promised hee 50 mances of gold, and 30
men, and 30 horses. Now of this were to witness Wulfstan the Archbishop, and Leofwin
the Ealdorman ; and Acthelstan, bishop; and Aelfred, abbot; and Britek, monk ; and
many good men in addition to them, both ecclesiastics and laymen, that this compact
was thus made. Now of this compact there are two writings: one with the Archbishop,
at Wigcre Castle, and another with Athelstan the bishop, at Herford.”
SECTION IY,
Illustratiom of Publicity as the Exclusive Means for the Transfer
of Landis.
Although contracts were clearly distinguished from the actual gift
of the lands, this latter might be thought by some to have been
privately transacted, and not necessarily in public. It is, however,
as pleasant, as it is easy, to prove the contrary.
We have the famous words of King Alfred :
Laws of Alfred, 41,—“The man who has hook land, and which his
kindred left him, we judge that he must not give it from his kin, if there
be writing or witness that it was forbidden him by those men who first
acquired it, or by those who gave it to him, that he should do so :
and then let it be declared in the presence of the king and the bishop,
before his kinsmen .”
It is plain from this law, not only that the Saxons considered
themselves free to aliene and devise, unless it was forbidden them in
the first delivery; but also that deliveries were not lawful, unless
they were publicly and specifically made at the judicial meeting.
Whether it was book land, folk land, or gafol land; the means of
transfer was the same.
The authority of these proceedings was so firmly established, that
property could be entirely freed of all counter claims by going through


the proper proclamations at consecutive meetings. Hence the law
of Canute the Great:
LL. Canute, 80. —“ And he who has defended land with the witness
of the shire, let him have it undisputed during his day, to sell and to
give to him who is dearest to him."
Purchasers took care of this. The following is a case in point: —
Wulstan forfeited some lands which the king acquired and sold
to a bishop. There was a shire-gemot at Cambridge held then.
When they all had sat down, Wensius arose and claimed the land. He
said that he and his relations had been unjustly deprived of the land,
as he had received for it no consideration, neither in land nor in money
It was witnessed however that Wulstan had bought that land of
Wensius for £B, in two payments, the last of which he sent by Leaf win
the son of Adulf, who gave it to him in a purse before “ the eight
hundreds on the south side of Cambridge where the land lay. "
Having heard these things, they adjudged the lands to the Bishop, and
they directed Wensius and his relations to look to the heirs of Wulstan
if he wanted more money for the lands. This very remarkable
case shows that the public transaction took precedence over any
alledged private contract. Wensius was allowed his remedy
on the private contract, but not against the passing of the lands by a
transfer completed openly before the hundreds.
Another lively picture is extant, from a transaction before a shire-
gemot, held at Aylston, in Canute’s days. A woman, before
witnesses, sent to her house from the shire-gemot, made a devise to
another woman in these words—l give thee both my lands, my gold
and my clothes, and all that I have, after ray life ; calling on the
witness to testify to the shire-gemot this, and that she gave nothing to her
son. The narrative proceeds :
Then stood up Thurcill the White in that shire-gemot, and prayed
all the dhegns to give his wife the lands which her relation Ixad
given to her, and they did so ; and Thurcill the White rode to St.
Ethelbert’s minster by all the folk's leave and witness, and left it to be
set down in one Christ's book."
There is another case extant respecting undoubted freehold estate
in possession of a high dignitary.
At a witena-gemot in a.d. 903, an Ealdorman stated that the writings
of his land had been destroyed by fire. He applied to the council for
leave to have new ones, new ones were ordered to be made out to
him, as nearly similar to the former as memory could make them
(Aside’s mss., Ho, 21.) This fully establishes both the jurisdiction
of the witena-gemot and the principle, according to which the writings
are only the evidence of proceedings had, or acts done at the judicial
meeting of the council or shire. For had it been then as now, to pass
by private deed, there would have been no renewal of the same pos-
sible, in the way here mentioned.


There is the most ample evidence that at the witena-gemot’s,
gifts of land were made and confirmed.
In a.d. 811, Kenwulf, at a very great council convened in
London, gave some lands of his own right, with the advice and consent
of the said council. Even the kings could not grant land without
the consent of the witena-gemot; for a gift of land by the king is
mentioned “ sed quia not fuit de consensu magnatum regni donum
illud not potuit valere.”
It would be tedious to enumerate all the grants where either the
judicial decree or the consent of the witena-gemot is mentioned.
The king aliened with consent of the national council. The common
freemen wanted no consent save that of their kinsman, if they had
possessions subject to such. But they always wanted judicial pub-
licity, and the peace proclaimed over it.
In short, as the Speculum has it : in lands nothing can be done
but the judge and the folk must know.
CHAPTER 11.
THE FEUDALIST AND MODERN CONVEYANCER.
SECTION I.
Effects of Feudalism on the English Tenures.
Blackstone affirms, what we have shown at some length in the
preceding chapter, “that the feudal policy was not received in this
island, at least not universally,* and as a national institution, till the
reign of William the Norman.”
The Saxon king, though he certainly had great power, great
resources and privileges, made no pretence whatever to a property
in all the land. This latter was reserved to become a strictly
Norman fiction, acquiesced in by the nation at last, when William,
having laid whole counties waste, had his Doomsday Book made, and
all Englishmen became his men.” (A.D. 1185.) Blackstone has
very ably reviewed the true features of this change.
From the prodigious slaughter of the English nobility at the
battle of Hastings, and the fruitless insurrections of those that
survived, such numerous forfeitures had accrued, that the king’s
* Something similar indeed to feodal tenure was known. The Saxon ealdormen, their
bishops also, and great men generally had domanial jurisdiction over their own tenants,
The Saxan “ degns” certainly were “Milites,” and, as well as the earls, besides their own
allodial lands, may have held some possessions in virtue of their dignities. All this,
however, was by way of exception, and, moreover, in close connection with the arrange-
ments of their jurisdictions. The Saxons, as their ancient monuments abundantly
testify, recognized a general tie on everybody’s lands and property, of whatever kind, for
the due fulfilment of his share both of his privileges and burdens in the judicial system
of the nation a tie not only (as modern egotism might adjust it) for penalties on
crime, but arising principally from a deep conception of the duty to assist the right, by
performing justice and judgment in the gate. The sheriff, the earl, the king, had their
ascertained remedy against any one who might neglect to join the hue and cry, the
inquest, the posse of the shire, or the witena-gemot. For every five hides of land, also,
one man had to go to the war, and generally no person was allowed (not even the king)
to exempt any lands from the well-known trinoda necessitous to bear the rateable pro-
portion in the militia, in bridgework, and in castlework. These burdens, however, being
of a public and general nature, cannot properly be compared to feudal tenures.


Norman followers now began to gain very large possessions in
England, and their regard for the feudal laws under which they had
long lived, together with the king’s policy, on a threatened invasion
of the Danes, effected the full establishment in England of the feuda]
system by law. From thenceforth the king was entitled to demand
of his subject the military service, as the statute then made has
expressed it (Guil. L, ch. 58), “ Secundum quod nobis debent
de feodis et tenementis suis de jure facere, sicut illis statuimus per
commune concilium totius regni nostri predict! ”*
By thus consenting to the introduction of feudal tenures, the
English probably meant no more than to put the kingdom into a
state of defence, and to oblige themselves (in respect of their lands)
to maintain the king’s title and territories with equal vigour and
fealty, as if they had received their lands from his bounty upon
these express conditions, as pure, proper beneficiary feudatories.
But whatever their meaning was, the Norman feudalists, skilled in
all the niceties of the feudal constitutions, and well understanding
the import of the feudal terms, gave a very different construction to
these proceedings, and thereupon took a handle to introduce not
only the rigorous doctrines which prevailed in the Duchy of Nor-
mandy, but also such fruits and dependencies, such hardships and
services, as were never known to other nations; as if the English
had in fact, as well as theory, owed everything they had to the
bounty of their sovereign lord.
It is well known that the Anglo-Saxons had become, notwith-
standing many drawbacks, both populous and prosperous against the
time of the Norman invasion ; but now all their arrangements,
favourable as they were for the developement of their resources, were
altogether broken up by the Conqueror. The measure of a knight’s
fee (in 3 Edw. I) was estimated at twelve ploughlands, and its value
(though it varied with the times) in the reigns of Edward I and
Edward II was stated at £2O per annum. And he who held this
proportion of land (or a whole fee) by knight’s service was bound
to attend his lord to the wars for forty days in every year, if called
upon.
Now probably the English meant this to be all. But military
tenure, in imitation of titles of nobility was thenceforth con-
sidered by the feudalists to descend by the same law, i. e., by
primogeniture, to the eldest son, in exclusion of all the rest.
Other qualities of feods were, that the feudatory could not alienate
nor dispose of his feod, neither could he exchange, nor yet mortgage,
nor even devise it by will, without the consent of his lord. ■ Now,
the unfortunate English people, having once done homage, and
agreed to render knight’s service for their lands, could not contradict
in their newly-created feudal courts, the doctrine that their tenure
* “As they ought to do to us, from their feods and tenements by law, as we have
made them a statute by the common council of the whole of our kingdom aforesaid.”


had all the marks of a strict and regular feud. It was granted by-
words of pure donation, transferred by investiture from the lord,
with delivery of seizin in a court of vassals, and perfected by homage
and fealty. So then they were in for it, and it drew after it, as of
unavoidable necessity—so the Norman courts would have it—these
seven fruits and consequences, as inseparably incident to the tenure
in chivalry, viz. : aids, reliefs, primer seizin, wardships, maritagium,
fines on alienation, and escheats.
1. Aids in money, to ransom the person of the feudal lord if taken captive; to get his
eldest son knighted, and his daughter married.
2. Beliefs, in arms and habiliments of war; or else in money, on the vassal’s death, by
his heir (if of age), 100 s. for every knight’s fee. By all the predecessors of Henry 11.
mere arbitrary redemptions were often exacted.
3. Primer Seizin. On the death of a tenant in capite, the king was entitled to enter
and receive the whole profits of the land till livery was sued out, which, being com-
monly done within a year and a day, the king contented himself with taking only the
firstfruits, that is to say, one year’s profits of the land.
4. Wardship consisted in having the custody of the body and lands of the heir,
without any account of profits, till the age of twenty-one in males and sixteen in
females. Henry 1., indeed, ordained that the custody both of the children and the
lands should belong to the widow and the next of kin; but this restoration of Saxon
principle did not last many years. The Norman courts enforced with insidious perse-
verance their lucrative doctrines, of which this is a striking exemplification. From
thence arose those inquisitiones post mortem, from thence the oppressions of Emptou
and Dudley, the wicked engines of Henry VII., who, under colour of false inquisitions,
compelled many persons to sue out livery from the crown who by no means were tenants
thereunto; ana afterwards the court of wards and liveries was, on the same entangled
machinery, erected, and by them the king’s vassals, amongst other things, were obliged
to become knighted or to pay a fine,
5. There was still another piece of authority of the guardian in chivalry over his
infant ward, even marriage. He had the power of tendering him or her a suitable
match, and if the infant refused, they forfeited the value of the marriage, i.e., so much
as a jury would assess, or any one would give to the guardian for such an alliance, and
double the value if the infants presumed to marry themselves without the guardian’s
consent. From this, which at first was a mere right of consent, for which King Henry I.
agreed to take nothing, soon, with the help of their lawyers, the succeeding kings, and
their great men, managed to get the perfect right of selling the ward in marriage,
expressly declared by the Statute of Merton (20 Henry 111., c. 1). John, Earl of Lincoln,
fave Henry 111. 3000 marks to have the marriage of Richard de Clare for the
eneflt of Matilda, his eldest daughter; and Simon de Montford gave the same king
10,000 marks to have the custody of the lands and heir of Gilbert de Unfranville,
with the heir’s marriage, a sum equivalent, according to Blackstone, to £lOO,OOO
at present. And this guardianship, being deemed more an interest for the
profit of the guardian than a trust for the benefit of the ward, was saleable and
transferable, like the ordinary subjects of property, to the highest bidder, and, if not
disposed of, was transmissible to the lord’s personal representatives. This continued to
be the condition of the country till the Restoration, a.d. 1660!
6. For every alienation the feudalist made fines to fall due to the lord of the fee, their
reasoning being, that if it was reasonable for the heir to pay a fine or relief on the
renovation of his paternal estate, it was much more reasonable that a stranger should
make the same acknowledgment on his admission to a newly-purchased feud. However,
this oppression, at least, the English managed, in regard of all common persons, to
exterminate by Magna Oharta, though the tenants in capite were considered to forfeit
their estates by alienation, till the Statute 1 Edw. 111., c. 12, which settled a license for
alienations to be one-third of the yearly value.
7. The last consequence of tenure in chivalry was escheat, the determination of the
tenure from the extinction of the blood of the tenant by either natural or civil means.
All these fruits and consequences the Norman courts palmed off
on the English nation, and would admit of no exceptions unless
proved in any case from the words of the feudal donation—a proof
which, of course the English were very rarely able to produce.
The feudalists found themselves obliged, indeed, to recognize what
they called feoda impropria: because the circumstances forced it upon
them to notice such as had been bartered and sold to the feudatory for


a price, or were held for a rent, or admitted to be alienable in them-
selves without licence, or to descend indifferently either to males or
females: but fortified in their idea of original paramount property in the
sovereign, they persisted that, wherever a difference was not expressed
in the words of the grant, even new created feods must in all respects
follow the nature of an original, genuine, and proper feod. It is not
difficult to perceive the false position to which the English saw them-
selves reduced. Some lands they managed to protect under the
name of soccage tenure (quorum custodia et maritagia ad propin-
quiores amicos jure sanguinis pertinebant —-meaning, when the
custody of infants and their marriage belonged to the next of kin, by
the law of consanguinity), some under shelter of the baronial courts,
some as gavelkind, some under the statute de donis, others by taking
advantage of trusts and uses, of fines, of recoveries, and a variety of
other shifts. But all these, as we shall more minutely examine in the
next part, were poor shifts indeed, gained at the sacrifice of truth
and straightforwardness, and but ill calculated to obtain even the
ends for which they were devised.
However, even thus far they were enabled only by slow degrees to
make head.
The first Herman king, and his son William Rufus, kept up with
a high hand all the rigours of the feudal doctrines. Their successor,
Henry 1., found it expedient, indeed, when he set up his pretensions
to the crown, to promise a restitution of the laws of king Edward
the Confessor, even the ancient Saxon system. But too soon this hope
proved fallacious. His charter being broken through, and the former
grievances being revived and aggravated, the nation had fo struggle
on for successive generations, during more than a century, till at
length the barons rose in arms, and the famous great charter at
Runny Mead was obtained from John, and, with some alterations,
confirmed by his son Henry 111. Yet its immunities, especially as
altered on its last edition (9, Henry III) fell greatly short of those
that had been granted, though never fulfilled, by Henry I. Aids,
primer seizin, wardships, maritage, &c., &c., were not only continued,
but, as we have seen, undisguisedly turned to pecuniary account.
Knight’s service itself degenerated soon into escuage, i. e., into
pecuniary assessments. Thus Blackstone (11., p. 7fi), states that
“ instead of forming a national militia, composed of barons, knights,
and gentlemen, bound by their interest, their honour, and their
oaths, to defend their king and their country, the whole of this
system of tenures now tended to nothing else, but a wretched means
of raising money to pay an army of occasional mercinaries. In the
meantime the families of all the nobility and gentry groaned under
the intolerable burthens which (in consequence of the fiction adopted
after the conquest) were introduced and laid upon them by the
subtilty and finesse of the Norman lawyers.”


SECTION 11.
The Effects of Feudalism in Changing the Language and Method of
Pleadings and Records. —Origin of Modern Conveyancing.
Wherever feudalism was received, it subverted every national
arrangement of judicature. So in England, too. The whole of the
jurisdiction of the shires and hundreds on landed property was
greatly interfered with, and at length broken up, through the innu-
merable feudal Courts, held wherever a feudal lord, of any degree,
happened to have tenants to constitute his court; in consequence of
which there remained little else for the county court, which became
successor to the shire-gemot, than criminal proceedings and
decisions on litigations, in which Norman judges laid down the law,
and had the pleadings in a language foreign to the English.
Under these circumstances the vassal was often glad to avail
himself of the aid which the craft of accredited clerks were eager to
offer ; and as if this evil, coupled with the violence of the tenants
themselves, had not of itself been sufficiently great, ecclesiastical
cunning suborned prevarication, and abstruse definitions made con-
fusion worse confounded, to which verbosity was added, on the
famous principle of a penny-a-line. If the reader has ever been
favoured with the perusal of the “notarial instruments” of that age,
he will be in a position abundantly to testify to the truth of these
assertions.
What the popular view of it was (and to this day is), we may
gather from Shakespeare :—-
“ Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings,
Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed.
That it may be to-day read o’er at Paul’s.
And mark, how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I’ve spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
The precedent was full as long a doing:
And yet within these five hours Hastings liv’d
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty!
There’s a good world the while! —Who is so gross,
That could not see this palpable device?
Yet who so bold, but says—he sees it not?
Bad is the world, and all will come to nought,
Where such bad dealing must be seen in thought.”
This statement of the scrivener’s the poet has almost verbatim taken
from the contemporaneous chronicler.
If it should be said that this was a climax under the reign of a
tyrant such as Richard 111., it is not to be denied that the seeds for
it were early sown. Oil the occasion of the Conqueror’s Doomsday
Book, Ingulphus boasts that the possessions of Croyland Abbey
were not rated in the full extent. Speaking of the jurors, he
says—“ These, exercising benevolence towards our convent, esti-
mated our monastery not at its true value, neither according to its


true space; in compassionate precaution of the king’s future exac-
tions and other burdens, providing for us with most pious bene-
volence.”*
The doctrine of pia fraus did not fail to thrive in a great variety
of branches. That baneful practice of using any form of words,
however contrary to the palpable facts, in order to suit some pur-
pose in view, which is daily exemplified as yet, and not at all con-
sidered by the profession as wrongful, took its origin from pious
fraud ; in such dangerous things even as formal verdicts.
So the learned Master of our Supreme Court, an undoubted
authority, informs us of the faint beginnings of the doctrine
of uses, as at common law, in the following words “Uses at
the common law were in most respects what trusts are now.
So early as Henry 11., with a view to elude the notion of guardianship
in chivalry (the oppressive character of which we have but briefly
reviewed in the preceding section), the ancestor enfeoffed his eldest
son (reserving to himself a right to the profits during his own life).
The practice, however, of conveying to one person to the use of
another did not become general until the reign of Edward 111., when
it was adopted by the ecclesiastics to avoid the effect of the statutes
of Mortmain. * * * * At length the statute of
uses was passed, the distinction between trust and tenure ceased,
and the jurisdiction of equity seemed for ever abolished. But, (adds
the learned author triumphantly) it was otherwise ordained. One
or two technical scruples, which the ordinary tribunals could not
remove, still remained, and the authority of the CouH of Chancery
was restored with renewed influence.”
He draws the conclusion—“ So futile are all legislative enact-
ments when they militate against the feelings of society /” And this
is well said ; because the feelings of society now are decidedly against
the “ influence of the Court of Chancery.”
At least, in our colonies, it is a -settled truism in everybody’s
mind, that everybody is entitled to do with his land as he pleases,
and that it is an ample measure of justice that can be had at the
hands of a jury. How is it then, how can it be then, that we are
not at liberty still to do with our lands as we would like to do,
but are involved in immeasurable, innumerable, infinitesimal diffi-
culties, of inextricable forms 1
In answer to this question, and which concerns us much, we
cannot help requesting, on the part of our reader, his most patient
attention to enter upon a separate but concise exposition in the
second part.

PART 11.
A REVIEW OF THE EVILS
Consequent on the Error of Attempting
MODERN CONVEYANCING,
TO EVADE,
Instead of Wholly to Abolish
THE OPPRESSIONS OF FEUDALISM.
The existing system (or rather anarchy) of conveyancing is (to da
the Feudalists justice) not the feudal one: but a conglomeration of frag-
ments of feudal origin and of any other origin you like. There is Saxon
gift, lurking under a latin donation, with Norman livery of seizin ;
Normans enfeoffing a Canonist, to convey to uses, to be conveyed to
trusts; side by side with very ugly looking suitors, seriously bent
upon cutting off a fee-tail, or on barring a poor widow from dower
with a host of et-ceteras ; and Sergeant Moore (not at arms), with a
very ready pen to make a freehold out by “ lease and release and,
more dignified, the Chancellor, bringing in for his help no less a
person than Caesar Augustus himself and his praetor, who, however,
has lost his lictors and their fasces, but instead of them is ushered in
much more politely by John Doe and Richard Roe. The nearest
thing in likeness to the whole amalgamation is a pudding-stone, and
it is cemented together, under the pressure of ages, with law-
French, an abundant sprinkling of golden fees, the sweat from the
brow of the poor, and the spoils of the rich.
This anarchy, I said, cannot in any way be laid directly to the


feudalists’ doors • but, through their systematic oppressions, they
have driven the nation into these unsystematic “ expedients.” So
long as feudalists had it their own way, they were sufficiently com-
pact in their forms.
Feudal transfers originally went only by feoffment or by grant,
and were not the means of passing the estate, but only the evidence
of its having been passed in the proper court.
The possession of land was given in the feudal courts, the
same as in the ancient Saxon meetings, symbolically, by delivery of
the twig, &c., or corporeally on the land, the feoffment in both cases
being the evidence merely of the transaction, and not essential to
its validity. Such charters, indeed, the feudalists themselves called
but “ brevia testata .”
Hence it is that the words “ HATH GIVEN,” and generally the
past tenses, are still employed in every deed of conveyance, and
not only employed, but emphatically styled operative words,
alluding to the true historical state of the matter; which is, that
these words were intended to record the fact of a gift having been
made in competent open court, and, being uncontradicted there and
properly passed, took effect and passed the estate.
The fundamental rule, which no one can dispute, was, “ that
where a freehold shall pass, it behoveth to have livery of seizing Now
livery of seizin was tradition in a court of tenants.
Thus livery of seizin and investiture went always together, not in
copyhold only, but in freehold too : the rule of the feudal law in
this respect being quite peremptory, yea prohibitory also—“ pares
debent interesse investiturce, et non alii.” (Feud. 1. 2. t. 58.) “ Inves-
titure must be made before the peers and not before others.”
It is not difficult to perceive, in most modern explanations, the
confusion of the “ delivery of the lands on the spot” (or corporeal
delivery of possession) with the symbolical one; the latter of which
was the only mode that could be available in the court of a shire,
county, or hundred. So long as these were considered to be (as
among the Saxons) the only place for transactions of this sort, all
went well. But the feudal lords interfered with this, because
they had a right to constitute their court, with their tenants, wherever
it suited them, and, of course, it generally suited both them and
their tenants best to hold their court, as occasion might require, on
or near their lands. Hence arose the doctrine, for which the Saxons
cared nothing at all, that delivery of seizin may be given on or in
sight of the land. Thus we see, that feudalism, though it did
neither shun nor curtail judicial publicity, as the principle of the
transaction, became the means of breaking up the only manner in
which publicity can effectually work and be continued, viz., to have
certain places of general and constant public resort. Such, in
the Saxon times, had been the shire-gemots and the folk-gemots.


But now, although publicity and judicial transaction was still con-
sidered to be quite as essential as before, in theory, for the validity
of the transaction, yet, in practice, through the change in the juris-
dictions which had taken place, the door was opened by which, in
process of time, publicity has become superseded, and the way paved
for the introduction of innumerable frauds. For now, instead of
there being a certain place and a general way of proceeding, there were
a hundred courts occasionally held, in different and uncertain places,
recorded in the memory of a particular tenantry only; or (at the
best) by some writing in addition to this, which had to be got up
by a clerk in the retinue of the lord, and that often had to follow
him wherever he went. The frauds and many other inconveniences
to which this led, became soon apparent, and so much more keenly
felt, as neither the 'proper object of “ delivery of seizin,” nor the true
jurisdiction of county court and hundred in these matters were as yet
entirely effaced from the public mind. But in vain the judges in-
terposed, and in vain were remedies proposed, even through enact-
ments of parliament. For, although, judging from our more general
and elevated point of view, the change that was taking place, involved
certainly a great loss to the nation ; the individual clung to it as a
means to protect themselves, their families, and possessions from
oppression, and often from utter ruin.
This was the true origin of conveyancing, as a private transaction,
in England.
The nobility managed in this way to get their estates entailed, so
as, in effect, to counteract the laws of forfeiture—a policy not to be
wondered at, in times when warring parties, on gaining the as-
cendancy, had their opponents executed for high treason. Then
Edward TV., perceiving what little effect, under such circumstances,
even attainders had on families whose estates were protected by the
sanctuary of entails, had it laid down in Taltarum’s case, that a
“ common recovery” suffered in tail, should be an efficient destruction
thereof. Thus “ recoveries'' became jictious proceedings, introduced by
by a kind of pin fraus (so Blackstone says) to elude the the statute
de donis : although the fraud was at least not pious in Edward IV.
However, the people soon turned the scales, by re-settling in a similar
way, entails that had been unsettled by recoveries ; which when Henry
YIII found out, he had address enough to procure a statute declaring
all estates of inheritance (under which general words entails were
covertly included) to become forfeited on conviction of treason.
Nevertheless these recoveries, however opprobriously and clan-
destinely introduced, have become in England by long use and
acquiescence a most common assurance of land and are looked upon
as the legal mode of conveyance by which tenant in tail may dispose
of his lands and tenements. Albeit, a more absurd piece of reading
than such recoveries could by no possibility be procured, as any one
may see, who will take the trouble to look for the form in a Lawbook.


Such, then, was the way, how—
(a) In the first place grants and feoffments.
(b) Secondly entails under the statute de donis. .
(c) And thirdly, proceedings? of recovery, &c., have come to be
blazoned forth in our 11 modern system" of conveyancing ! But this
is not all. For while the nobility were entrenching themselves
in their entails; the ecclesiastics, to serve their own interests, at
which we have glanced in the preceding chapter, had,
Fourthly, Conveyances made to uses.
This caused a long war of enactments.
The case stood thus. About the time of the reign of Edward 111
the foreign ecclesiastics introduced this thing, (to evade the statutes
against deathbed dispositions) by obtaining grants of land not to
their religious houses directly, but to the use of their religious houses :
which the clerical chancellors of those times held to be Jidei commissa
(after the pattern of the civil law) and binding in conscience, and
therefore assumed the jurisdiction which Augustus had vested in his
praetor of compelling the execution of such trusts in the court of
chancery. Unfortnately it was overlooked that the constitution of
the Court of a praetor was quite another thing than the constitution
of a court in chancery, and as it was most easy to obtain such grants
from dying persons, a maxim was established, that though by law as
it then stood the lands themselves were not devisable, yet if the
testator had enfeoffed another to his own use, and so was possessed of
the use only, such me was devisable.
This was crushed by 15 Richard 11. c. 6, with respect to reli-
gious houses. But persons continued to avail themselves of the
same idea, and the Chancellor’s leaning towards it, to enable the
owner of lands, during his lifetime, to make various designations of
their profits as prudence, or justice, or family convenience might
from time to time require ; till at length, during the long wars in
France, and the subsequent civil commotions between the houses of
York and Lancaster, uses grew almost universal, through the desire
that men had (when their lives were continually in hazard) of pro-
viding for their children by will, and securing their estates from
those cruel forfeitures already before alluded to.
Now all this may be said to have been innocently and sometimes
very laudably applied. But this can be no excuse for the continua-
tion of the same perplexity through ages of lawful peace and hap-
piness.
Before, however, fully entering upon a review of this practice,
another general observation will be necessary.
It has been pointed out already, that in “recoveries” and “fines,” a sham of public
court proceedings is made. This and the eulogiums, which lawyers to this day frequently
bestow on the ancient principle, which was evaded by the introduction of uses, viz.:
“ livery of seizin” as a “principle of notoriety, pervading and binding together the whole
of our conveyancing system in freeholds,” is remarkable indeed: inasmuch as the
whole and every particular of that system has become, through the introduction of
uses, the very reverse of that notoriety and publicity which was originally intended


and secured by our ancestors: for livery of seizin is now of no avail. If common
sense could teach anything to persons, so much above_ its range, it should teach the
lawyers that livery or seizin cannot now be considered in the light of a public act any
further than delivery of a deed, or of anything else, and that hence the very boast they
make of notoriety as a useful principle, condemns the “system” by which that useful
principle has been and is still evaded and made nugatory. This condition of affairs has
been, and still is, much regretted by the best of the profession, such as Blackstone.
Eut the profession as a whole do not care for what the best of the profession say; let
alone what the common people will say or think. This nugatory thing, modern livery
if seizin , and, along with it, the doctrine of entries, is kept up and declared to be
indispensable under a great many circumstances, too deep no doubt for the penetration
of common sense, but very useful for the continuation of the “ system.”
One should think, indeed, that the statute of uses, which at length
was passed, as history shows, upon great consideration, and intro-
duced in the most solemn manner, in order to consolidate the prac-
tice, might have sufficed to secure, if not uniformity, at least con-
sistency, by establishing one 'principle as governing the whole. If
we must needs become convinced that straightforward publicity is
hurtful to our landed interest, let it be so ; or, if otherwise, let pub-
licity be established by quashing any attempts at evading it. But
this will never be done, so long as duplicity is allowed to exist in
the judicatures. This is the game at which the worst of the profes-
sion are constantly playing, and still the best of the profession either
will not summon courage to introduce a better principle, or are dis-
abled from doing so through some fault inherent to the arrange-
ment of the profession itself.
The history of the statute of uses (27 Henry YIII. c. 10) is apt,
indeed, to illustrate this most colossal absurdity of all, the duplicity
of the judicature, and of the profession, and their learning, and the
perplexed condition the public are in, in consequence thereof.
An abridged, yet faithful recapitulation, will be interesting and
useful.
Before the statute the courses of the dull and overcast streams of
conveyancers to uses were, as Lord Bacon complains, “ turned to
deceive many of their just and reasonable rights. A man, that had
cause to sue for land, knew not against whom to bring his action,
or who was the owner of it. The wife was defrauded of her thirds;
the husband of his curtesy : the lord of his wardship, &c. ; the
creditor of his extent for debt, and the poor tenant of his lease.”
After reciting these and many other inconveniences, the statute of
Henry VIII. enacts, that “ When any person shall be seized of lands,
&c., to the use, confidence or trust, of another person, the person
entitled to the use in fee simple, fee tail, for life, for years or otherwise
shall from thenceforth stand and be seized or possessed of the land,
&c., of and in the like estates as they have in use, trust, or confidence”
and again “ that the estate of the person so seized to uses shall be so
deemed to be in him or them that have the use, in such quality, &c., as
they had before in the use. ”
The statute having thus annihilated the intervening estate of the
feoffee, and turned the interest of the person, entitled to the use, into
a legal instead of an equitable ownership ; the courts of common


law now began to take cognizance of uses, instead of sending the
party to seek his relief in equity, and very many of the rules before
laid down in equity, were adopted with improvements by the judges
of the common law.
Thus the power of the court of chancery, over landed property at
least, appeared to be greatly curtailed and diminished, if not entirely
to cease. But one or two technical scruples, which the judges found
it hard to get over, restored it with ten fold increase.
They held, in the first place, that “ no use could be limited on a use ”
and therefore that the second use was a mere nullity—not adverting
that in a feoffment to A. and his heirs, to the use of B. and his heirs,
in trust for C. and his heirs, B. was never intended by the parties to
have any beneficial interest, and that, the instant B. by the operation
of the statute became seized, he became seized to the use of C. which
second use the statute might as well be permitted to execute as it
did the first.
Again—as the statute only mentions such persons as are seised, this
was held not to extend to terms of years, &c., therefore if a term of
1,000 years be limited to A. to the use of (or in the trust for) B. the
statute does not execute this use, but leaves it as at common law.
So these people were driven, from judge and jury, to seek their
remedy in chancery.
Further, where lands are given to one and his heirs, in trust to
receive and pay over the profits to another, this use is held by some
to be executed by the statute, but others refer it to chancery, together
with all such arrangements as vest in the trustees any discretion in
the application of the profits, as to make repairs, &c., or for to provide
for the maintenance of the cestui que trust. All these must go chancery.
And lastly, but not least, it is the practice to introduce only the names
of the trustee and the cestui que trust (the one that is to be benefited
by the trust) the estate being conveyed to A. and his heirs, to the use
to A. and his heirs, in trust for B. and his heirs ; and thus this
important statute has come to be effectually repealed by the repetition
of half a dozen words.
This then is the way how conveyancers manage to put affairs for
generations to come into chancery ; by putting in such words as will
work that way ; or if they please they can put words to keep matter
on the law side.
If then this is not irresponsible ruling and status in statu, there must
be no meaning at all in such words as responsibility and common weal
or woe.
We may now sum up in Blackstone’s words.
“ Conveyances to uses are by much the most frequent of any though
in these there is certainly one palpable defect, the want of sufficient
notoriety : so that purchasers or creditors cannot know with any
absolute certainty what the estate and the title to it, in reality are,
upon which they are to lay out or to lend their money. ”


Our prospects are then suddenly brightened up ; “ But this has
now given way to a twelfth species of conveyance (having enume-
rated eleven others before) called “a covenant to stand’ * seized
to uses for life, in tail, or in fee.” Here the statute executes at once
the estate; for the party intended to be benefited, having thus ac-
quired the use, is thereby put at once into corporeal possession of the
land without ever seeing it, by a kind of parliamentary magic.”
After which there could be little doubt but that a conveyancer
was able to make any law his handle for any thing. An extinguisher,
however, is at hand : “ But this conveyance can only operate when
made upon such weighty and interesting considerations as those of
blood or marriage.” Thus sending us back for all other purposes to
the former eleven , and further on to a thirteenth and fourteenth species
of conveyance, viz. : “ bargain and sale,” and by lease and release,”
which, we are told, was first invented by Sergeant Moore, soon after
the Statute of Uses, and now the most common of any, and therefore
not to be shaken, though very great lawyers have formerly doubted
its validity.”
To this we are happy to be enabled at last to add a fifteenth
species, to wit, the South Australian one, under Ordinance No. 15
of 1843, declaring that the three words “bargain, sell, and release”
shall do as well as the whole length of the learned Sergeant’s
invention. This latter species, therefore, being quite colonial, we
should think might serve as a finale.
But we must not be too sanguine about it. For our professional
friends have now continued these twenty years to “ enfeoff,” or to
“ give,” to “ grant,” to “ lease,” to “ exchange,” to “ partition,” to
“ release,” to “ confirm,” to “ surrender,” to “ assign,” to “ defeat,”
to “ convey to uses and trusts,” to make us “ stand seized to uses,”
to make “ bargains and sales,” to “ lease and release,” besides be-
queathals and devises, settlements, jointures, entails, and bars there-
unto, &c, &c., and thereby (anything to the contrary enacted
notwithstanding) to involve us and our land to such a degree, as
to make some “professional” men quite bold in an assertion that
the tide of confused and entangled titles which they have raised
cannot now be rolled back.
The people stood abashed and looked on. They are told by their
lawyers that we must not attempt to raise even a bank or dyke
against the further inroads ; for that the influence of their system is
sure to undermine and wash it away.
They already have us in for private Acts of Parliament as a needful
mode of assurance. “It may sometimes happen (they cooly tell us)
that, by ingenuity of some and the blunders of other practitioners, an
estate is most grievously entangled by a multitude of contingent
remainders, resulting trusts, springing uses, executory devices, and
the like artificial contrivances, so that it is out of the power of either


the courts of law or equity to relieve the owner, <kc.” In these and
other cases of the like kind the transcendant power of the Parliament
is called in to cut the Gordian knot, and by a particular law, enacted
for this very purpose, to unfetter an estate.
Seing then that even for the worst that can happen there is a
remedy in their hands, their advice is, with the town clerk of Ephesus,
that we ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly, but come with them
to a better understanding than ever before ; amounting (I presume)
to a covenant to stand seized of our lands to their uses for ever.
The plain matter of fact, however, is that this would amount to
a thing worse than feudalism and its exploded doctrines. For
our lawyers bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne. The
costs of their transactions undoubtedly surmount very often any
amount of fines, or reliefs and redemptions of inheritance which ever
was exacted by feodalists.
For a plain conveyance we are often charged £5 ss. ; for a mortgage
involving perhaps not <£6o, the same; for an abstract it is nothing
unusual to pay £lO to £l5 or more. Taking into consideration the
charges to both parties, the average cost of deeds has been estimated
at £l5, it has been asserted by others that £5 55., was the average
for one side. However the least that can be reckoned as an average
for both sides is £7 7s. This on only 7,000 deeds a year
amounts to a burden of £50,000 annually, or (taking the last four
years) the sum of £200,000 and upwards, paid only for deeds in four
years.
Taking £5 ss. on 7000 deeds it is still upwards of £35,000 a
year or £140,000 in four years, according to the average struck by
a gentleman of the legal profession a member of the house of
assembly.
To this must be added, as a charge on the system, the costs of
litigation arising out of it and the actual losses consequent on
evictions and unmarketable titles.
We are justified to call such charges, arising out of claims, the
nature of which neither is, nor ever can be ascertained by the people,
worse than feodal exactions. We call it abject slavery, if we consider
that the system, thus dearly paid for, works badly and must ever
continue to work badly, in consequence of the ungovernable absurdity
of its construction, which places its agents as sole judges of their own
acts and deeds beyond the reach of any control by the people.*

PART 111.
CODE NAPOLEON,
ON THE
NOTARIAL OFFICE AND REGISTRATION
OF RIGHTS ON IMMOVEABLES.
EXTRACT OF THE LAW OX NOTARIES AND
NOTARIAL ACTS.
SECTION I.
General Remarks.
The notary’s office, being set apart by the French law for the
sole purpose of authenticating people’s transactions in a ready way, at
moderate expenses, and so impartial as to be above the shadow of
suspicion, is kept entirely distinct from any other. Napoleon,
perceiving that the solicitor’s, attorney’s, or pleader’s calling is apt to
clash with the notary’s duty, has not hesitated to own this view, and
sternly declared that the advocate’s and the notary’s offices are, and
the same shall be deemed to be, incompatible with each other.
A French notary therefore cannot be a solicitor, neither can a
solicitor, &c., be notary, by their law.
Moreover, the notary public is not permitted by the French code
to put himsell in for a trustee, or in fact to insert any disposition
whatsoever in his own favor. If inserted, such dispositions are void.
Also, being resident in a certain district, and restricted in his acts to
this; the notary is bound especially to testify to the identity of
the contracting parties, either from his personal knowledge, or else
from the knowledge of two citizens known to himself, and attested
to him as such; and he is not permitted to make his relations, clerks,
or servants, witnesses.


He must also keep the minute of every transaction passed at his
office, for the inspection of such as may become lawfully interested
in knowing its contents.
These, with a few other highly interesting particulars, we will now
prove from the law itself, passed in the 11th year of the French
Republic.* In doing so, we condense only such dispositions as form
the fundamental constitutional part of the legislation on the notariat,
and such as, by settling the essential forms of authentic acts, have a
direct reference to the civil code. All other particulars are here
omitted.
SECTION 11.
Functions, Precincts, and Duties of Notaries.
1. The notaries are the public functionaries, established for the
purpose of making out all the acts and contracts, to which the character
of “acts of public authority” is required to be given, and also for the
purpose of assuring the date of such acts and contracts, to preserve
the deposit and deliver the engrossment and expeditions of the same.
2. They are appointed fpr life.
3. They are bound to perform their services, whenever they are
required to do so.
4. Every notary is obliged to reside in the locality which shall be
appointed for him by the Government. In case of contravention,
the notary shall be considered as having tendered his resignation,
consequently, the “ Minister of Justice,” after having taken the
advice of the tribunal, can propose to the Government his re-
placement.
5. The notaries exercise their functions, if resident in a city
where there is a royal court, within the extent of the jurisdiction
of such court. If in a town, where there is only a local court
of “ the first instance,” within the jurisdiction of such court. If
in any other community, within the extent of the court of a justice
of the peace.
6. All notaries are forbidden to issue instruments beyond their
precincts; under pain of being suspended from their functions for
three months; of being deposed in case of relapse, and of all the
damages to parties interested.
7. The functions of notaries are incompatible with those of judges,
proctors of the king at the tribunals (crown solicitors and attorneys
general), their substitutes, recorders or masters, advocates or 'pleaders,
bailiffs, collectors of taxes (direct or indirect), justices, recorders,
and bailiffs of quarter sessions or court of a justice of the peace,
commissioners of police, and commissioners of sales.
* The Law of the 25 Ventose. 11th Year, Eepublique Franchise,


SECTION 111.
Of the Notarial Acts —their Formalities, Minutes, Engrossments,
Expeditions and Indexes.
1. Notaries cannot receive or make out any acts, in which their
relations by blood or affinity—in the direct line in all degrees, and in
the collateral line to the degree of unele or nephew inclusively—
shall be parties, or which shall contain any disposition whatsoever
in their favour.
2. The acts shall be made out by two notaries, or by one notary
assisted by two witnesses, French citizens, able to write, and resident
in the district of the community where the act shall he made out.
3. Two notaries, related by blood or affinity to the degrees pro-
hibited in clause 1, cannot concur in making out the same act. The
relations by blood or affinity, either of the notary or of the contracting
parties, to the degree prohibited in clause 1, their clerks and servants
cannot be witnesses.
4. The name, description, and residences of the parties must be
known to the notaries, or else be testified to them in the act by two
citizens, known by them, having the same qualifications as those
that are required for witnesses to instruments.
5. Every act must set forth the names and place of residence of
the notary that makes out the same, under a penalty of 100 francs,
in the nature of amends. They must also set forth the names of the
witnesses to the instrument, and their residences, the place where,
year and day when the acts were made out; —under pain of nullity of
the act if not signed by all the parties ; or though signed by them
all, under pain of being of the authority of private signatures only;
or even under pain of wilful falsehood as the case may be.
6. The acts of notaries shall be written in one and the same
context, readable, without abbreviations, blanks, gaps, or intervals;
they shall contain the names, Christian names, description and places
of residence of the parties, as also of those witnesses that are to be
called as to the identity of the parties. They also must set
forth the sums and dates written in full ; the powers of attorney
for the parties contracting shall be attached to the minute, and
in the minute mention shall be made that the act was read over to
the parties. All this under pain of 100 francs (in the nature
of amends) against the contravening notary.
7. The acts shall be signed by the parties, the witnesses, and the
notaries, who must make mention thereof at the end of the act. As
for such parties who either know not how to write, or are unable to
do so, the notary must make mention, at the end of the act, of their
own declaration to that effect.
8. Notes and riders must not (save as hereinafter provided) be
written in the margin; that is to say: they must be signed or marked
as well by notaries as by the parties, under pain of nullity of the


notes and riders. If therefore the length of the note makes it
necessary to place it at the end of the act, it must then not only be
signed or marked as the notes in the margin, but again expressly
approved of by the parties under pain of nullity of the note.
9. There must be no scribbling, superscription, nor interlineation,
nor addition in the body of the act, and the words superscribed,
interlined or added shall be null. Such words as must be struck
out shall be struck out in such a manner that the number of the same
can be stated in the margin of the corresponding page or at the end
of the act, and approved of in the same way as marginal notes ; all
this under a penalty of fifty francs against the notary, as well as all
damages to those interested, and even deposition from office in case
of fraud.
10. A notary re-introducing feudal titles, clauses, or expressions,
or trespassing on the laws concerning the measures and decimal
numeration, shall be condemned in a penalty of 100 francs ; in case
of refusal to be redoubled.
11. The notary is to have affixed in his office a list of the names
of all such within his district as are interdicted as incapable of
administering to their own affairs.
12. All notaries acts are evidence in court and executory in all the
realm : nevertheless in case of a complaint being laid against an
essential fault, their execution can be stayed by the finding of a jury;
under certain circumstances (\ provisionally) by the judges.
13. The notaries are hound to keep minutes of all the acts made
ont by them. This includes powers of attorney, discharges for rent,
salaries, arrears of pensions, &c.
14. The right to deliver the engrossments and exceptions, belongs
to no other notary but the one who keeps the minute ; nevertheless
every notary may give a copy of any act, deposited with him instead
of a minute.
15. The notaries cannot surrender any minute except only in
certain cases provided for by the law, or in virtue of a judgment.
Before such a surrender they must make and sign a copy, which, when
certified by the judge and attorney-general is then substituted for the
minute.
16. Likewise the notary cannot without an order from the judge
give a second engrossment or expedition, nor allow other persons but
such as are interested directly, or as heirs, &c., to take knowledge of
the contents of the acts, under pain of damages and fine of 100 francs,
or suspension from office—for three months—provided nevertheless
the creditors, &c., have a right to demand an expedition of an act for
the purposes of public registration, according to the law of the same.
17. The delivery of the first engrossment to the party entitled to
it; must be mentioned in the minutes—a second one cannot be
delivered, under pain of removal from office, except by an order
from the judge, to be attached to the minute.


18. The notary’s seal must show his name, official character, and
residence ; and be on every act he delivers.
19. He must keep proper indexes of all his acts ready for
inspection.
REGISTRATION OF PRIVILEGED DEBTS AND
HYPOTHEQUES.
CHAPTER I.
In regard to the application of property to the discharge of debts
the Cede Napoleon has the general principle thus set forth :
Whosoever enters on a personal obligation is liable for its
fulfilment with the whole of his gopds, immoveable as well as moveable,
and future as well as present. — Art. 2092.
The goods of the debtor are the common pledge to his creditors,
amongst whom the price is to be distributed equally, unless there are
legitimate causes of preference.— Art. 2093.
Such causes, in the phraseology of the code, are either privileges
or hypotheques ; the latter of which are confined to immoveables only.
For our immediate purpose it might be an easy way to confine
this treatise to the charges on immoveables only. But in order to
gain a succinct review of the whole system, it will be more advan-
tageous to exhibit its particulars, touching moveables as well as
immoveables, under some leading points of view, in the order of the
code. We shall therefore consider :
I. Claims privileged on moveables and immoveables generally.
If. Claims privileged on certain moveables only.
111. Claims privileged on certain immoveables only, and hypotheques
on such, either general or special.
SECTION I.
First then, there are a few claims so pre-eminently privileged
as to be preferred before all others in the proceeds of the debtor’s
moveable property first, and then in his immoveables, without
prescribed formalities of authentication. Such highly privileged
claims, however, are the following only, viz.: —court fees, expenses of
funeral and of the last illness, servants’ wages for the current and the
last preceding year, and provisions advanced to the debtor and his
family during the last six months by the baker, butcher, &c., and
one year by wholesale dealers. Any of these must be paid before
all others, save only the claims on certain moveable things.
SECTION 11.
Secondly ; some other claims are privileged in the proceeds of
certain moveable things only. Pledged in this way are, for instance,


travellers’ things, for provisions taken at an inn; goods carted, for
the cartage; any moveable thing pledged for a debt, by giving the
possession to the creditor : also—
Outlay made for the preservation of goods is privileged on them.
The price of moveables sold, but not paid for, if these are as yet
in the possession of the buyer, whether he bought on credit for a
specified time or otherwise, is privileged on the things :
If sold on credit for a specified time the seller may even have the
things resold, or prohibit their being sold, provided he does so within
eight days from the delivery, and the things are in the same state as
when delivered. The landlord, however, takes before the seller,
unless he can be shewn to have had knowledge of those things not
being the tenant’s own.
With regard to landlords. House or farm rents are privileged on
the year’s crop, furniture, implements, &c., for the whole of the term
if the lease was publicly executed, or has a certain term though
privately signed; in both cases the other creditors can make the profits
of the lease all their own, by paying up all arrears.
Demises privately signed without a certain term have this privilege
for one year only.
The landlord’s privilege also extends to the claim for repairs
belonging to the tenant, and for non-performance of the conditions of
the lease generally.
Harvesting wages must, however, be paid out of the year’s crop, and
the price of farm utensils, trade utensils, &c., out of the sale of these
in preference even to the landlord’s.
Goods brought away without his consent, the landlord may seize,
within forty days (if farming implements) or fourteen days (if house
furniture).
The debts arising from abuse or prevarications of public officers, in
the exercise of their functions, are privileged on such funds as are
lodged by way of security on their behalf, and on the interests that
may be due thereon.
Such then are the claims privileged in certain moveables only.
section in.
More complicated, to some extent, is the law of privileged claims
on IMMOVEABLES.
An attentive perusal will nevertheless amply repay for the very
moderate amount of time which will suffice for the comprehension of
even this part of the subject, under the advantageous disposition of a
well digested code.
The ruling principle appears to consist in a right, given to every
creditor, to preserve his claim in force against any third party by
making it public—the law, by these means, bestowing a premium on
his vigilance.
For this purpose there is provided, in every district, (arrondissement)


a public office, called the “bureau for the conservation of hypotheques,”
competent for the registration of debts on all or on any of the
immoveables, situated in that district, on demand. Such registering
is called “ inscription.”
On the other hand, proprietors, purchasing or succeeding to
immoveables, have the option given them, by adopting certain public
proceedings, to have their property purged of encumbrances, latent
or public, and the remaining claims ascertained and clearly registered.
For this purpose there is a book of “ transcriptions ” kept, at the
same bureau, into which (on demand) the contracts of transfer, &c., are
transcribed entire.
Both inscriptions and transcriptions, as we have already observed,
can only be made on demand : but it is part of the registrar’s
DUTY TO KEEP THE TWO REGISTERS CORRESPONDING to each other, SO
as to show in the register of inscriptions every debt, that appears on
the face of the transcript of any contract of transfer in the other book.
Should the registrar neglect this, he is liable to penalties and damages;
the damages to be paid before the penalties.
The lawgiver appears to have intended thus through the counter-
acting influence of the creditor’s eager activity, on the one hand, and
and the proprietor’s desire to have his property freed, on the other
hand, to maintain a sound medium of security, both for creditors
and possessors. But this is not all.
He has kept in view at the same time, with a paternal eye to the
unprotected, and with a stern hand on evildoers, the interests of such,
as (being unable to take care of themselves) are entrusted by the law
to the care of others—the youthful bride, the sorrowful widow and the
fatherless, the idiot, the absentee, to a certain extent even the simple,
the credulous, and the illiterate.
Besides the ample measure of security, given to contracting parties
and the public, in the constitution and regulations of the notary’s
office (as we have seen in the first chapter) under the code generally,
the just rights of married women, children under age (whether
emancipated, or not), idiots, &c., and absents, are specifically guarded,
by bestowing on them a “ legal hypotheque ” that is to say, an
hypotheque arising solely and undefeasibly, by the operation of the
law.
He has also granted certain privileges to builders and workmen
which will be detailed also in the next chapter.


CHAPTER 11.
HOW TO CHARGE IMMOVEABLES UNDER THE FRENCH LAW.
SECTION I.
The Hypotheque : its Nature, General Division, and Publicity.
The means for charging a debt, or any kind of obligation, upon
immoveable property, in the French law, we have already shown
to be the hypotheque.
There is no other means given to charge immoveables. For the
“ privileges” bestowed on some claims in preference to others, the
code has also declared expressly, to be in the nature of a hypotheque.
The nature of a hypotheque is defined in the code as “a
right real on the immoveables, pledged for the discharge of an
obligation,” and although leaving the creditor destitute of the pos-
session, it is secured in effect, by its being further defined as a right
indivisible by its nature, so as to consist entirely on every immoveable
so charged, and on every portion thereof, and to follow the same
into whatsoever hands it passes ; this being, in fact, what is meant
by the term “ right real'' It might be more completely described,
therefore, as a right real, conferring the powers on non-payment of a
debt, to take its value out of certain lands by the sale of the same.
The manner of the sale, for effectuating it, is also, as we shall here-
after sho*w, very carefully regulated by the law.
Thus, by adopting these plain definitions from the Roman law, a
kind of security is framed, as simple in its nature as it is satisfactory
in its effects. Its advantages are manifest, when compared with the
encumbered, lengthy way, as dangerous as it is costly, of creating a
separate estate in the creditor, by undoing the debtor’s estate first,
and afterwards undoing the creditor’s estate again, in order to have
to reconstruct the debtor’s estate. Yet even these advantages have
been greatly improved upon through a deviation from the Roman
law, by adopting from the Saxons those principles of publicity in
hypotheques, the general outline of which we have given in the
preceding part, and which we shall now proceed to illustrate in
their particulars, according to the manner of the French law.
To meet the nature of the manifold claims that may happen to
arise, the legislator has arranged them in groups, as being, according
to their several original, either legal, judicial, or conventional hypo-
theques; but all these, in every instance, he has subjected to this
rule (laid down in Art. 2115): —“That no hypotheques what-
ever can take place except in such cases, and according to such
formalities, as the law has authorised.” The prescribed formalities
are simple, but calculated to render publicity successful in every
instance, even in such cases where it is not made to be exclusive.
In conventional hypotheques certainly—the class which includes the
most common cases of loans, and other charges not immediately


connected with a purchase of the property itself— publicity is the
exclusive means for giving effect to them ; —and in the other two
classes those excepted cases, in which publicity is left optional with
the parties, are few, and so much counteracted by the advantages
bestowed by the law on publicity in every instance, as to render the
exceptions practically insignificant.
These remarks will presently be more fully understood.
There are, as we have indicated, three principal groups —
1. Legal hypotheques, as collateral to which may be considered
Judicial ones ; both these are general by the law, although they
may be rendered special by agreement.
2. Claims of certain creditors, privileged on certain immoveables.
Their hypotheque is special.
3. Conventional Hypotheques. These are always special.
But the principle of publicity is established, as general for all these
classes, in the following words :
Art. 2134. “ Between the creditors any hypotheques, whether legal,
judicial, or otherwise, have no other rank hut from the day of their being
inscribed on the registers of the conservateur, in the form and manner
pr escribed by the law; save only the exceptions set forth in the Art. 2135,
which are only those granted to minors, wives, &c., forming the
principal part of the first group.
SECTION 11.
First Group : Legal and Judicial Hypotheques.
These exceptions are for the benefit of minors, &c., and of
wives, but the husbands and guardians are at the same time strictly
bound to make these hypotheques public by requesting inscription,
without any delay, at their own peril.
Besides, the coadjutor (who must be appointed in every guardian-
ship*) is enjoined to see to this, under pain of paying the
damages, and in default of him the “ procureur du roi ” (crown
solicitor). The next of kin and friends generally, as well as the
wives and minors, &c., themselves, may also request these inscriptions
to be made.
They and their friends or protectors on their behalf are entitled to
exercise this hypotheque on all the immoveables of the debtor,
(the husband or the guardian) future as well as present; but,
as occasion may require, with the following important modification,
that is to say : it may be agreed on, that the inscription of their
hypotheque shall be made on certain immoveables only, to the
exclusion of all the rest; but under no circumstances can it be agreed
to, that there shall be no inscription on their behalf.
* In any case of guardianship there must he chosen "(according to the code) a coadjutor
guardian, whose duty it is to superintend the guardian’s management, so as to correct
any neglect or overstepping of his powers.


It will be seen from this that even these two most protected
classes —the claims of incapables and of married women—are not
intended to enjoy latent privileges, but that great precautions are
taken to make publicity even of their claims the ordinary rule, so
that, in fact, the whole of the distinction raised in their favor reduces
itself to the extreme case when inscriptions of this sort should
happen to be neglected by all on whom the duty is imposed, in which
case the lawgiver has decided in favor of the widow and the father-
less, rather than that, through the neglect of their protector, they
should be allowed to become defrauded. Ordinarily, therefore, even
their hypotheques cannot be said to be latent.
A legal hypotheque is also secured to the state, the municipal
bodies, and public institutions, on the immoveables of their receivers
and accountable managers, for their defaults; but these must be
inscribed, to make them valid.
Very similar to the legal ones, are judicial hypotheques, which
arise upon any judgment to secure the party for whom it was given ;
as also on acknowledgments or verifications of private signatures
under acts of an obligatory nature, upon which certain summary
proceedings may be had. In any of these cases the hypotheques may
be exercised on the immoveables in actual possession of the debtor,
and also on any which he may afterwards acquire, under some re-
strictions, equally calculated to guard against oppression.
We have now enumerated all the cases in which any hypotheque
of general effect is allowed to take place.
section in.
Second Group : Privileges on Certain Immoveables.
The next group in order are claims privileged on certain
immoveables only. These, too, are of great importance :
(a) Of this sort are the rights of the vendor and of the lender
of the purchase money , on the moveables sold :
( b ) The claims of co-heirs amongst themselves and of other parties
dividing immoveables:
(c) As also of creditors claiming on the immoveables transmitted
from a deceased person :
(d) And of builders and workmen (and of the lenders to them) on
the premises built or repaired.
All these, but no others, are specially privileged on such immove-
ables severally, as happen to be the subject of their several trans-
actions in respect to them.
But their specialty is not their only distinction. For in this class
the mode of giving effect against third parties by publicity is
exclusive.
While the claims of the first group, as of married women, infants,
&c., are so favoured to grant them a general preference, even though
in an extreme case no steps were taken to make them public ; these


other claims, privileged only on certain immoveables, such as the
builder’s, and vendor’s, co-heir’s, &c., are, on the contrary, expressly
prohibited from taking any effect whatsoever, as against third parties,
unless they were first made public by inscription.
These claims, though privileged, cannot therefore operate in
preference to the claims of third parties but from the date of their
inscription in the public registry only.
But in order very clearly to perceive the working of the system
it will be necessary to particularize.
We must first exhibit the distinct objects of their claims, and then
the manner permitted for their publication.
1. The seller has a privilege on the immoveables sold, for the
price. In case of successive sales, on which the price is due wholly
or in part, the first seller is preferred to the second, the second to
the third, &c, ; but the third, for instance, by registering in time
may secure preference before the first, though under these regulations
it is not likely that inscription in any of such cases will be neglected.
The same remark applies to all the following, namely—
2. Those who have advanced money in the acquisition of an im-
moveable are privileged therein, provided it is shewn in an authentic
form by the contract for the loan that it was destined for this purpose,
and, by the sellers receipt, that the payment was also actually made.
3. Co-heirs are privileged on the immoveables of the inheritance
for the guarantee of the partition made between them, and for the
surplus value of one lot over another.
4. Architects, contractors, masons, and other artizans employed
in erecting, reconstructing, or repairing buildings, conduits, and other
works whatsoever, have a privilege on the value of the works,
according to authenticated estimates of the premises taken first in
their original state before the beginning of the works and afterwards
at the time of their completion. Also,
5. Those who have advanced money to pay or re-imburse the
contractors or mechanics enjoy the same privilege upon authenticated
proof, not only of the intention of the loan but of the receipt by the
workmen also. But inasmuch as it is prescribed (in Art, 2113)
that, notwithstanding their privilege, “ all privileged debts shall not
date in regard of third persons, but from the epoch of the inscrip-
tion,” —there is also a certain manner provided for them how to
preserve their claim, if they choose, against third persons by
registration.
So, in the first instance, the seller preserves (according
to Art. 2108) by having his contract of transfer transcribed,
attesting that the whole or part of the price is due to him, the effect of
which is, that according to Art. 2101, the transcript of the contract
operates as an inscription for the seller (and the lender) of such
moneys as were paid on the purchase, in which latter case the lender


is substituted in right of the seller by the same contract. Notwith-
standing which, the registrar of hypotheques is answerable, under
pain of the whole of damages and interests of third parties, ex officio
to make the inscription in his register of the debts arising from the
transfer of the property; as well in favor of the vendor as of the
lender (appearing in the contract), the latter of whom may also
cause the transcription to be made instead of the vendor, in order to
obtain the inscription of that which is owing to them on the price
(Art. 2108).
Co-heirs and other parties dividing an immoveable preserve
their privilege as against one another by inscribing within sixty days
from the date of the act of partition or public licitation, during which
delay no hypotheque can be registered to their prejudice in favor of
new parties, nevertheless they themselves are subject to the right of
the creditors to the succession, according to which the representatives
of a deceased person cannot, during the first six months from the
decease, have any hypotheque effectually established to the prejudice
of his creditors and legataries, these therefore preserve their right by
registering on each immoveable belonging to the case of succession
during that period.
Assigns of privileged claims exercise their predecessor’s right in
his stead and place.
In conclusion, it is determined in the Article before alluded to,
2113, that if any of these privileged creditors neglect or otherwise
have not accomplished the prescribed forms (of either transcription
or inscription) they shall nevertheless not cease to be entitled to
an hypotheque ” but inasmuch as their hypotheque cannot date as
against third persons, but from the time of its inscription, it amounts
to this, that a privileged creditor obtains the preference against the
assign or the heir, and also, so long as his claim last, can always
obtain an inscription, so as to make it valid, from that day forward,
against third parties.
In this consists their privilege, for this is, what other creditors
cannot do without an express convention.
It therefore remains for us to consider this third class ; conventional
hypotheque. This class, includes the most common cases of loans and
other charges not connected with immediate purchase of the property
itself, or with marriage portions and the like, as before observed.
SECTION IV.
Third Group ; Conventional Hypotheques.
In this class the principles, both of publicity and specialty, admit
of no exceptions. The definition of the hypotheque, as being a
right real, following the land into whatsoever hands it passes, is
here most rigidly adhered to.
First, with regard to the form, conventional hypotheques cannot
in any case be consented to but in authenticated form before two


notaries, or one notary and two witnesses, and have no operation
beyond the mere contract for debt, unless by inscription in the
register of the “ conservateur.”
Then, with regard to the persons permitted to contract—
A conventional hypotheque cannot be contracted for, but by such
as are capable of alienating the immoveable. The wife can only do
it by consent in writing of her husband (Art. 217), the guardian
by consent of a “ conseil de famille” for absolute necessity or
manifest advantage.
Further, with regard to the extent and subject matter op
the security : they must he special. This is a most important
deviation, for the better, of the French code from the civil law.
Art. 2129 provides—
“ There cannot be a conventional hypotheque valid but such a one
as, either in the authenticated document constituting the debt, or in
some subsequent authentic document, declares especially the nature
and the situation of every one of the immoveables, actually belonging
to the debtor, upon which he consents to the hypotheque for the
debt. Each of his present goods can be made the subject of the
hypotheque by expressly naming it. Future goods cannot he made
the subject of a conventional hypotheque.”
In this, the most material deviation of the code from the civil law
of the Romans—which latter allowed of an hypotheque by any sort
of agreement, on the whole of the property, present or to come, of the
debtor —it may be readily perceived how necessary specialty is, as a
consequence of publicity; because the latter without the former can
not be carried out to any degree of certainty or completeness. The
exceptions, which the code still admits in favor of legal or judicial
hypotheques we have stated above; but we have shewed that they
confer on such a creditor little more as against third persons, in virtue
of the law, than what the creditor on a conventional hypotheque has
in virtue of his convention—even the right to have his debt inscribed
on a certain immoveable —and this being done, it holds good against
all the world.
Such as have a right, conditioned as to its beginning or determination
or eventually defeasible, (it is hardly necessary to say) can only
consent to a hypotheque subject to the same conditions or eventualities.
It is also self-evident that additional hypotheques may at at any time
be declared. If the premises are destroyed or deteriorated, so as to
make the security insufficient, the creditor may sue for his debt, or
demand additional security.
Also, a conventional hypotheque is not valid, but insomuch as
the sum, for which it is consented to, is certain and determined by the
written contract; if the debt is thereby conditioned as to its existence,
or undefined as to its value, the creditor cannot request an inscription
any further, than according to an estimate, which he must expressly


declare, but which the debtor may have reduced according to the
merits of the case.
The hypotheque extends to all improvements on the property
subjected;!© it and with the principal money covers also the interest
after the inscribed rate, but only for the year past.
Upon the whole then it may be safely asserted that the French code
of laws, by adopting publicity and its more immediate consequence,
has effectually reconciled the claim of security of property and credit,
and dispatch of business with the certainty of right.
CHAPTER 111.
ON THE RIGHT OF PURGING AN ESTATE.
SECTION I.
We have seen that creditors, having their privileged 'or ordinary
hypotheque registered on an immoveable, follow this into whatsoever
hands it may pass, in order to be placed according to the nature of
their claims or registered privilege.
The purchaser of an immoveable, however, has a right to purge it
of all anterior claim by certain proceedings, but failing to do this, he
remains through the sole effect of the registrations, obliged, as pos-
sessor, to pay all registered debts, so, however, as to enjoy all terms
and benefits of which the original debtor might have availed himself.
He must, in such case, either pay all principal moneys, interests,
and costs, or abandon the property, without any reserve, to the
creditors. Out of the proceeds of the abandoned property the
registered creditors are then paid first, and after them the personal
creditors of the former vendor.
If the new purchaser fail to take the steps requisite to purge the
estate from debt; any creditor may at any time cause the property
to be publicly sold after giving thirty days' notice to the original
debtor and to the new purchaser, the latter of whom may, till adju-
dication, redeem the property by paying the debts and costs in full.
Also, if the purchaser expressly abandon the propertj 7 , any creditor
may procure it to be sold forthwith.
The third possessor is answerable for deteriorations through neglect
of his, and cannot claim for improvements as stick, but only accord-
ing to any surplus value of the property over the debts.
For fruits, profits, &c., he has bond fide received, he is answerable
only from the date of the service of notice on him.
SECTION 11.
How to Register a Purchase or a Gratuitous Donation.
To prepare for the purging of his immoveable from privileges
and hypotheques, whether known or unknown, the manner prescribed
is this—
Art. 2181, The contracts of transfer of the property of im-
moveables or of rights real (which are considered as immoveable)


are to be transcribed entire by the “conservator of hypotheques”
(registrar) of the arrondissement where the immoveables are situated.
This transcription is made on a register, destined for that purpose,
and the registrar is bound to give his acknowledgement and, in
proper time, his certified copies to the applicants.
Art. 2182. The simple transcript of the transfer into the register
however, does not purge the immoveable of the hypotheques and
privileges established thereon; the vendor transfers to the purchaser
nothing more than the property and rights he had himself on the
object sold : he transfers them subject to all the same 'privileged debts
and hypotheques with which he stood charged (including such as are
not then, but happen to be registered in virtue of privileges, &c.).
Therefore, Art. 2183, “If the new proprietor will protect himself
from such suits of creditors as are allowed by the law (see section
I. of this chapter) he is bound, either before the suit or at the
latest within one month from the first service of demand on him,
to give notice to the creditors (at the domiciles chosen by them
at their inscriptions) in manner following, viz.; by communication
of the following particulars :
1. Extract of the contract, containing only the date and quality
of the documents, the name and precise description of the vendor or
donor (in case of donation), the nature and situation of the property
bought or received as a gift.
2. Extract of the transcript, certified by the registrar.
3. A table in three columns : the first column containing the dates
of the hypotheques and the dates of their inscription; the second
column, the names of the creditors ; the third column, the amounts
of the debts inscribed.
These particulars the registrar will furnish on demand.
CHAPTER IY.
RECAPITULATION OF THE ESSENTIALS, AND EXPOSITION OF THE
FORMALITIES.
SECTION I.
The only legitimate causes of preference in a creditor are privileges
and hypotheques; but privileges on immoveables being in their nature
the same as hypotheques, we have shown their preference to con-
sist chiefly in the right which they give to have the claim inserted
by registration, to the same effect as a conventional hypotheque.
We have also shown that a hypotheque, though it leaves the
creditor destitute of the possession, is nevertheless effectual, as it
is defined in the code to be indivisible in its nature, consisting
entirely on every immoveable so affected, and on every portion
thereof, and follows the same into whatsoever hands it passes.
Art. 2156 —'N0 hypotheque, however, can take effect if registered


only ten days before insolvency , neither among the creditors to a suc-
cession, if not registered before the decease.
Art. 2154. By registration, hypotheques and privileges of debt
are preserved in such effectual operation against any third person,
for the space of ten years from the date of their inscription. Tliis
effect ceases, if not renewed on the register before the expiration of
that period.
Art. 2151. During the period of the existence of the hypotheque
on the register, the current interest, as before mentioned, passes
with the principal money, but arrears of interest for a year only.
Art. 2151. But any arrears may be made the subject of separate
hypotheques.
Art. 2140. Peculiar to the French Law is the following
disposition : —“ That all creditors registered on the same day take
concuri'ently with each other (i.e. in case of a deficiency, lose pro-
portionately to the amount of their claims), no regard being had to
the priority of the hours or times of the day.
SECTION 11.
How to get a Debt Registered.
Art. 2147. To get a debt registered, the creditor, or some one on
his behalf, presents to the registrar the original (or certified copy) of
the notarial or otherwise authenticated contract (or of the judgment)
from which the hypotheque or privileged debt arises.
Art. 2141. To this he must join a written statement, in duplicate,
of the following particulars :
1. Creditor's name, Christian name, and residence—his occupation,
if he follow one—and the domicile (which the law obliges him to
choose, to render notices, subpoena’s, &c., serviceable) this, however,
he or his assigns may change by giving notice on the register. (Art.
2152.)
2. Debtor's particulars the same, or, at any rate, such an individual
and special description, as will enable the registrar in all cases to
recognise and distinguish the person charged with the hypotheque.
3. The date and nature of document evidencing the debt to be
secured.
4. The amount of the principal money as expressed in the
document (or estimated, as the case may be according to Art. 2132),
the rate of interest and other emoluments, together with the times
when payable.
5. Statement of the species and situation of the objects (premises
&c.), upon which the creditor intends to preserve his privilege or
claim.
Art. 2148. This special statement of the name and situation of
the goods is not required, by the French code, for legal or judicial
hypotheques—for in such, according to it, a single registration
secures the claim upon all the debtor’s immoveables within the


district. So in the case of public officers (to secure the fulfil-
ment of their duty) of guardians, and of husbands (for the dowry of
their wives, Ac.) it is by the French law not necessary to mention
specially the goods to be affected as security, it being sufficient to
declare the nature of the right, to be secured and the amount of
debt, if already defined. (C. IST. Art. 2153.)
Art. 2149. On the goods of a deceased person inscriptions may be
requested simply by the deceased’s name (so as number 2 above.)
Art. 2150. On receiving the above particulars, the registrar
mentions their contents in his register, and returns to the applicant
the notarial document (or the certified copy thereof) together with the
duplicate of the particulars attached thereto, but not without having
first, at the foot of these, certified that the inscription was made
accordingly.
section in.
Cancelling Inscriptions.
Art. 2157. Registered entries may be cancelled by consent of the
parties interested in the same, and capable to that effect ; or in virtue
of a final judgment.
Art. 2158. In any such case, notarially attested documents, or
the original judgment must be produced and deposited with the
registrar.
Art. 2160. The courts may order an inscription to be cancelled,
if it was made without foundation on the law, or on a contract ; or
on the foundation of a contract that proves to be irregular, or extinct,
(satisfied by payment, Ac.) also, if the privilege or hypotheque itself,
though lawfully begun, become terminated in any of the lawful ways,
that is :
(a) By the extinction of the principal Debt
(b) By the creditor renouncing the hypotheque.
(c) By a new possessor purging the property in the manner allowed
him by the law.
( d ) By prescription.
SECTION IV.
Manner of 'Registering and Indexing Costs.
All sales and donations among the living, as well as settlements
restrictive of alienation * (whether by will or act), if presented for
registration are transcribed at full length: all charges on immoveables
are inscribed by entry of the particulars (if sent in as above). Both
the registers (of transcription and inscription) are made out in
chronological order—according to the names of persons, and not of
properties—a very important drawback on its usefulness.
The costs of registering debts are charged to the debtor (if not
otherwise agreed for), but must be advanced by the applicant, except
in cases of legal hypotheque.
* Permitted in favor of children, grandchildren, brothers, and sisters and their
children and grandchildren, but no further.


SECTION V.
Responsibilities of Registrar.
The registrar is bound in certain cases to enter on the register of
inscriptions charges which result from the transcriptions of contracts,
without notice from the parties; and he must neither refuse nor
delay the enrolment of contracts, the recording of charges, the
granting of certificates, under pain of damages and fines. He is
bound to furnish office copies and certificates to all parties requiring
them ; and is responsible not only for any omission to enrol or
register, but also for any omission of existing charges from his cer-
tificates. The registrar furnishes a security in landed property,
which remains exclusively affected to the purpose during the whole
period of his functions, and for ten years afterwards.
SECTION YI.
Legal Effect of Registration in France.
The register is no bar to adverse possession ; the periods are, as to
immoveables, where possession is acquired bond fide , and apparently
by legal title, and fhe owner is resident within the jurisdiction in
which the property is situate, 10 years—if he is resident without,
20 years—without title shown, and with or without good faith, 30
years. But adverse possession (except certain personal actions) does
not run against minors, interdicted persons, between husband and
wife, against the wife in certain specified cases, nor in certain other
cases, including that of warranty in eviction, against which it only
runs from the eviction itself.
General Observation.
It will be readily seen from the above that there is no register of
ownership in France, just as with us, and we shall therefore not
fail to point out the consequences of such deficiency, for our object
is merely to enable the reader to judge of the workings of the different
systems in comparison to the degree in which the system of publicity
is maintained more or less.
P.S.—lt is requested that the following note belonging to page 47, chapter 111,
section 11, should be read in reference to the context of that section.
2184. He must declare at the same time that he is ready forthwith to satisfy the debts,
hypotheques, and charges, to the amount only of the price, without distinction of such
as are then due or otherwise.

PART IY.
THE MERITS OF THE
SYSTEMS OE EEGISTEY
Now Practised in different Nations , and
IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA,
And Discussion of the Reformatory Measures
LATELY PROPOSED.
SECTION I.
The Systems of Saxon and French Origin in Europe and America
tried by the Eequisites of Reason.
Having sketched the leading features and advantages, we must not
omit to point out the one great defect in the French system of
registration—it is not complete. Its elaborate provisions lack every
element requisite to form A registry of ownership.
This defect is owing to the resistance offered, when the code was
under discussion, by M. Tronchet. In so doing M. Tronchet has in-
flicted on the French nation, on a large scale, evils very similar to
those which Governor Hindmarsh brought on our small community
when he quarrelled with the worthy Resident Commissioner of
Public Lands. The Code Napoleon, by leaving ownership in the
shade, left a door open for litigation on adverse possession, for
lengthy and intricate search of title, and its numerous train of fraud
and expense; and people have not been wanting to make use of that
door, and revive all those evils in France too.
We extract the following from parliamentary papers :
The most defective part of the system now in force in France is unquestionably the
manner in which transfer of property is regulated. The absence of a disposition ordering
enrolment upon the public registers of deeds of alienation destroys a great portion of the
advantages of hypotheques.
Another mischief results from the non-registration of securities, and of leases of
several years duration. Authors have inveighed against the facility with which frauds


are committed every day to the prejudice of hypothecary creditors, by landowners who
create usufructs (antichreses, like mortgages with possession, or long leases), of which
they receive the price by way of anticipation, or which encumber the property so as to
leave but a delusive security.
The disproportion in France between the interest payable in loans upon immoveables,
and the rate current in other operations, hampers trade, and prevents all improvements
in the cultivation of the soil: but is mainly considered to arise from the insecurity of
title for want of complete registration. It results from the examination of eminent
French judges, that, without production of the title-contracts, a purchaser cannot be
secure from the claims of (amongst others) a vendor with clause of resale (like a legal
mortgage), the danger of which lasts five years: a prior vendor at undervalue (i . e. less
than a seven-twelfth of the real value), a risk lasting two years; of a donor to whom
issue was born afterwards, 30 years from the birth of the youngest; a copartner, a vendor
claiming for unpaid purchase money: for these alone a3O years’ title is necessary.
And as the register is made out according to the names of persons, not of properties,
the purchaser who has cleared the property from all charges appearing on the register
during the ownership of his immediate vendor, must ascertain that the same formalities
have been accomplished by the latter on his own purchase, and so on from vendor to
vendor; looking in every case to the contingencies of marriage, interdiction for waste-
fulness, and other causes, guardianship, heirship. &c., the charges resulting from which
are either latent, or to be barred in a peculiar manner. Add to this that except in certain
cases adverse possession does not run against persons under disabilities.
Greater dangers, however, remain. A purchaser comes forward to buy land; he
examines carefully the vendor’s title-contracts; finds them correct; makes a clearance
of charges (purge) pays down the price. He now fancies himself in peaceful possession.
Suddenly a previous purchaser, who had kept his purchase contract secret, and had not
entered into possession, claims the land, and obtains judgment. What means had the
second xmrehaser of guarding himself against the error into which he had been led, since
the legislature has refused to compel the publicity of all transfers of property? These
are cases of 1807,1818, and 1821.
Another case mentioned is that of a sale retaining a life estate, followed by a second
sale. On the death of the tenant for life, the claim of the first purchaser must prevail:
and so it was decided in 1816. This is very similar to the case on the possibility of which
Mr. Brodie grounded his well-known opinion, since confirmed in principle by Lord
Lyndhurst, oh the continued necessity for a 60 years’ title in England.
A sale, even by auction, under authority of justices, will not protect the purchaser in
France against a previous purchaser to whom the sale was not notified; decided in 1810.
And the same principles apply to the grant of a life estate or usufruct, of a lease, of an
easement previously to the purchase, against none of which can the purchaser be secure,
except hy a sufficient period of adverse possession.
It will hardly be believed, yet this parallel is as true as it is
interesting to us.
With us, Mr. Fisher, from the beginning of the colony, advocated a
cr/mplete system of registration; Governor Hindmarsh threw it out.
But for that, the South Australians would have become as well able as
the Americans are, in all ordinary cases, and at very moderate expense,
to inspect and judge for themselves of their titles to land, generally
with as little risk as they inspect their titles to a mixed herd, or to
the dividends from a mine. They would have employed professional
aid, if they chose, but not have been forced and put under necessity
to do so.
Let us now glance at the publicity of law titles as established in
America :
The laws for the simplification of the transfer of land are of vast importance. In all
the states there are registers kept of all the deeds relating to the land, whether
conveyances, mortgages, or leases. An explanation of the system of transferring land in
Ohio will serve by way of illustration of the system prevailing throughout all the states,
POB THE PRINCIPLE IS THE SAME IN ALL OP THEM.
In each county there is a register kept of all the deeds affecting the title to the
lands within the limits of that county. An officer called a recorder is elected by the
people every three years : it is his duty to cause the deeds brought to his office to be
copied at full length into the books kept for that purpose. The fees for making these
copies are about three shillings. The recorder’s certificate appended to the copy of a
deed makes the copy good evidence wherever the original deed would be required. All
wills, judgments, and decrees, affecting the lands in the county, are also recorded in the
office of the clerk of common pleas, or supreme court. The whole legal title, therefore.


is on record, and open to the examination of anybody without charge. Generally
speaking, the title to land is, in consequence of this publicity, notorious, and the
purchaser does not find it necessary to fully examine it. He may easily look at the
recorded title deed of the man from whom he intends to purchase, and ascertain whether
he has charged or encumbered the property. This will cost the purchaser nothing—
there are no fees to pay for the search, and if he be a man of ordinary intelligence he
is quite able to make these inquiries for himself; nor can he have far to travel for the
recorders office is in the centre of the county, which is only twenty miles square. In
some cases, however, where the title is obscure or complicated, it may he expedient to
employ an attorney to examine the records, for which and preparing the conveyance the
the fee of one or two guineas is ample remuneration.
Marriages, births, heirships, intestacies, and so forth, are usually established by regular
evidence taken before the courts on the distribution of assets, and may be examined easily
and without expense: whereas, in England, the conveyancer has to rely upon unauthor-
ised and ex parte statements and affidavits. In England, too, it is the practice to rely
upon previous examinations of the earlier title made on behalf of former purchasers; and
it is usual in the conditions of sales of property by public action to insert restrictions of
the purchaser’s right to enquire into the title. Under the American system, the title can
be more fully examined than it can in England, and yet the expence attending the
transfer of real property is at least twenty times greater in England than in America.
The publicity of land titles has conduced to the adoption of a more simple form of
conveyance than that which prevails in England. No recitals are necessary, because the
important facts are on record, and, instead of limited covenants for title, a simple warranty
is made in few words. No covenant to produce title-deeds is required. Of course the
absurd practice of conveying by lease and release to use, the execution of two deeds instead
of one, and a round about declaration of trusts instead of a direct conveyance to the
purchaser, has long since ceased in every part of the United States, and each conveyance
is a simple grant from the seller to the buyer.
There is no reason whatever why the same system should not be adopted in England:
on the contrary, there exist the most urgent considerations for its immediate introduc-
tion. The consequence would be, that in a majority of cases each man would prepare
his own conveyance. This is the common practice in America: the purchaser goes to a
stationers shop and procures a printed form of conveyance, for which he pays about
2d.; he fills np the description of the property, copying from the last deed. The seller
goes before a justice of the peace, and acknowleges the deed, pays him Is., and the deed
is completed, and ready to be recorded, which may cost about Its. more. Contrast this
with the English system, which is at once ruinous in its operation and antediluvian in
its character.
A very remarkable fact it is, nevertheless, that the Code Na-
poleon, with his strict regulations of the notarial office and cheap
and accessible system of registering charges on land, though
incomplete, has endeared itself to the people of every country into
which his victorious arms had carried it; so much so as to oblige
their rulers, very unwillingly, to yield to the men of business and
the clamorous demand of the general public, to retain this system. The
Prussians on the Banks of the Rhine, and in fair Lombardy, the
Austrian men of iron-handed grasp have been obliged to yield in
this respect.
Are then we, the free colonists of South Australia, to he made
believe, as some professional men have insinuated, even on the hustings,
that it would be better for us, instead of perfecting what measure
of registration we have got, to part with, abolish, and annihilate
public registration altogether, and instead of it to fall back on private
deeds only !
Such opinions having been advanced in public speeches, it becomes
necessary to animadvert on them. The proposition is indeed as
monstrous as that barbarous amalgamation of feudalistic forms and
chancery practice, by the fetters of which it would have us rivetted
again exclusively. If its advocates should find their darling some-
what roughly handled in consequence, they will have to thank none


but themselves for it. As for the South Australian landholders,
the commercial and trading population, the widow and the fatherless,
it would be a matter of the utmost consequence, next to ruin itself,
to see registration abandoned. We will therefore briefly discuss all
the different systems, beginning—
First, with the system of mere private documents : proceeding—
Secondly, to that of securing title by a registering of deeds, so as
to vest the title by the deed and not by the registry: and conclude—
Thirdly, with the system of assuring title by registry only.
Under any of these points it will be noticed whether the evidence
of title, as obtained by instrument only, or by registry only, or by
both, is to be considered as essential and conclusive, or merely
incidental and accessory.
It will be well, also, constantly to bear in mind the character and
actual extent of the different practices in different countries.
(a) Non-registration tried by majority of Votes of Nations.
While exclusively private conveyancing is nowhere practised but in
England (with the exception of some counties), and, while even there
private conveyancing is upheld by the overbearing weight only
of settled interests either of political or pecuniary nature against the
decided opinion of all the rest of the community, including many of
the most eminent members of the legal profession • it is, on the other
hand, the universal practice in all portions of Christendom (except
England) to maintain public registration, more or less predominant,
and more or less perfect; but in none of them after having once
become introduced has registration ever been abolished.
This view becomes the more decisive the more its details are seen.
Let us only examine the point of completeness or incompleteness.
While the principle of complete registration (both of ownership
and charges) had its true original in the constant publicity of allodial
transfers in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian antiquity, before ever
feudalism was known; it has been handed down, and ultimately
prevailed, and is the practice (though with some feudalistic alloy)
in all the colonies of British origin in North America and the West
Indies, and (with alloy of civilian origin) in all Denmark, Sweden,
Norway, the Hanse Towns, most other parts of Germany, Prussia,
Austria, Switzerland (except Geneva).
The French system, however, (registering chiefly the charges,
but the ownership merely by way of exception) has become adopted
in Belgium, Rhenish Prussia, Baden, Geneva, Sardinia, and the Two
Sicilies, amongst European countries ; in Hayti and Louisiana, amongst
American; and its influence is also largely felt in Lombardy, in
Holland, in WuHemberg, Bavaria, as well as in Greece. But all
these last mentioned countries (with very few exceptions) have either


rendered the system both practically and legally complete by adding
the registry of ownership to that of charges; or at least have availed
themselves, to the best of their ability, of the aid of surveys and
cadastres, practically with a view to supply the deficiency.
In Baden, by the law of 22 December, 1809, every person acquiring immoveable
property is required to have his title entered on the public registers; without he fullil
such form he can neither legally defend his right of ownership nor charge his property
With hypotheqUes, and all hypothecary debts contracted by the previous owner remain
valid until enrolment of the said transaction
In order to effect a common hypotheque there must be presented to the notary an
extract from the public land registers, showing that the mortgagor is registered as sole
and absolute owner of the land to be mortgaged, together with an extract from the
register of hypotheques, showing whether and to what extent the property is already
subject to charges.
Geneva also found a way to complete the deficiency to some extent. Thereby a sale
by authority of justice is a complete bar to all claims of a proprietary or hypothecary
nature which should be made public before the order of sale.
This principle is also adopted in Saedinia, and is of ancient character in Lower
Canada.
The dangers of legal proceedings as between creditors are greatly mitigated, the land-
registers are made legal use of toward the identification of property, and a sale by
auction under judicial authority discharges the land from all privileges and hypotheques,
thus conferring an absolute title as against creditors.
In consequence of that enactment the registration of easements, leases, usufructs, &c.,
has become universal in Geneva.
In Belgium the law of 3rd January, 1824, made transcription compulsory of all deeds
of transfer of property; and the superior perfection of the cadastre under the new
regulations of 1845, is made the means for the duly recording of all charges on the land,
whether by matter of fact or law; it being provided that all mutations resulting from
sales, partitions, exchanges, successions, &c., shall be notified on the cadastre by extracts
of the contracts of transfer.
It is the tendency of registration to render itself more and
more popular, useful, efficient, and satisfactory ; whilst the nature
and practice of mere private conveyancing is such as to render itself
more and more involved, unsafe, dangerous, tedious, expensive,
unpopular, and odious. The true state of the question, therefore, if
just put upon the issue of registration or nonregistration—may be
best summed up in these two conclusive observations, stated in a
report to both houses of the British Parliament: —
We have ascertained that in Scotland, and in the British Colonies, and in different
states of Germany, and in France, and other states of Europe, the registers are considered
to be productive of essential benefits, although in some of those countries inconvenience
is acknowledged to arise from the registration not embracing all interests in real
property. In several countries registers have been enlarged and extended, and we are
not aware of a single instance in which a register has been discontinued.
In short, while registration with deeds or without, is considered a
very good thing by all the other people ; deeds without registration
are only patronized as yet by some settled interests in England.
Under such circumstances, to moot abolition of registration was
certainly as much out of place on the hustings in South Australia, as
it is altogether behind our age in the nineteenth century.
But should it indeed be wanted for people to he put in mind
how contracts, or even deeds (however solemn) without registration
would work? —here are practical particulars :
(6) Deeds without Registration tried hy their consequences.
Read the decision come to by our colonial legislature in the time
of Governor Grey ; —lt is expedient to prevent secret and


fraudulent Conveyances, and to provide means whereby the title
to real property may be more certainly known. (5 Yict. No. 8.)
“ Frauds are frequently committed by means of secret warrants of
attorney to confess judgment.” (clause xxviii.)
“Frauds are frequently committed by means of secret bills of
assignments or bills of sale, whereby when the party giving the same
is in failing circumstances, his goods may be taken by a friend or a
favoured creditor to the prejudice of his other just creditors.” (clause
xxviii.)
“It may easily happen that a will is suppressed or concealed, in con-
sequence of which a purchaser for valuable consideration will be
defeated or disturbed in his purchases or debts by titles made by such
a will.” (Clause xii.)
That most cumbrous and inefficient contrivance, covenant to
produce deeds—a mine of wealth to the lawyers—is unavoidable
where there is no complete and efficient registration.
On this topic the parliamentary committee tell us :
In numerous cases, persons interested under deeds have neither the possession, nor
means of enforcing the production of them. When an estate is divided, and becomes
the property of different persons, or when different persons obtain partial interests in an
estate, the same deeds constitute the title, or part of the title, of many persons. These
divisions must always f/o on to a great extent. * * * Even when a covenant is
obtained to produce the deeds, it is only in very few cases that it is permanently
effectual. * * * These cases depend upon the general law of covenants, which is ill
adapted to purposes of this nature, and often gives rise to questions of the greatest
nicety and difficulty. When the covenant is imperfect, the party is often unable to
enforce it, and still oftener is the holder of the deeds unable to secure to the purchaser
their future production. The consequence in either case is, that the title is un-
marketable.
Supposing tbe party to be in possession of a perfect covenant it
may fail of effect, because the party bound by the covenant may not
be known, or may be out of reach, or may be incapable of being sued;
and there is always the risk of the loss of the deeds.
The London bankers and merchants also have spoken out—
Deeds and other documents affecting registered securities sometimes, and indeed not
unfrequently, pass through the hands of commercial people, and in all such cases they
necessarily feel the serious inconvenience arising from the delay, expense, and
uncertainty which always attend the conveyance of real property.
To put down the erroneous notion that possession of title deeds is
security the Commissioners took evidence to this effect—Equitable
mortgages, by deposit of deeds, lead to frequent litigation, and often
defeat the purpose of economy and involve fair purchasers in intricate
questions on the priority of charges. They should be abolished by
the legislature.
Tacking Securities.
A person who advances money on mortgage of an estate which is
already subject to a mortgage, is liable to be deprived of his security
either by the first mortgagee, who, without notice, may advance further
sums and add them to his prior charge, or by a subsequent purchaser
or mortgagee, without notice, who may afterwards pay off the first
charge, and thereby obtain the legal estate.


It not unfrequently happens that an estate which has been once
mortgaged is afterwards mortgaged to different persons, and each of
such persons considers himself secure, believing that he is the second
incumbrancer, and that the value of the estate is sufficient to dis-
charge both the debts. In all these cases the one who is fortunate
enough to acquire the legal estate, by paying off the first mortgage,
obtains a preference over all the other mortgagees; so that when the
charges on an estate amount to more than its value, the last encum-
brancer, by paying off the first and obtaining a transfer of his security,
is allowed to tack (as it is called) his oim charge on the first mortgage,
and thereby prevail against the second and all other intermediate
encumbrances. This evil is not prevented by notice. The only
expedient by which the purchasers of an equitable estate or a second
mortgagee can obtain any protection against these is by giving notice
to the first mortgagee. * * * We all know the little reliance
that can be placed upon notice and the difficulties with which it is
attended. And even when binding on the person in whom is the
legal estate, it has no effect as against a subsequent purchaser or
mortgagee without notice.
Even Glanvil himself might have told the lawyers better.
Speaking of mortgages, he says, according to Blackstone (Vol,
11. chap. 10.) “si non sequatur ipsius vadii tratitio curia
domini regis hujusmodi privatas conventiones tueri non solet ”
—“if delivery follow not of the security itself, the court of
our lord the king uses not to protect such private contracts,” —
for which the reason given is, to prevent subsequent and fraudulent
pledges of the same land “ cum in tali causa possit eadem res
pluribus aliis creditoribus turn prius turn posterius invadiari”—that
is : “ because in such case the same thing might be pledged to several
other creditors as well before as afterwards.”
Securities made by deposit of title deeds without any memorandum
in writing are occasionally used, but they are always considered as a
dubious and unsatisfactory species of security. They are generally
accepted either because the emergency of the case will not admit of
the delay requisite to effect a more complete security or because the
party depositing them objects to the expense which would attend any
other course.
No doubt can be entertained that the mischief which might be
expected to flow from such a state of things exists to an extent which
would alarm the holders and purchasers of lands, if they were aware
of the risks to which they are exposed ; and that in a great number
of instances estates, and especially securities for money, are defeated
in consequence of latent defects of title arising from the non-produc-
tion of documents.
Such plain facts are conclusive to show that the workings of deeds
without registration lie decidedly in the direction of fraud, deceit,


litigation, and expense. Remember, therefore, if you take deeds
without registration, you can spend without end, and run into liti-
gation without mitigation.
Let us hear no more then, in South Australia at least, about deeds
without registration.
We consider next—How will registration work, either with
OR WITHOUT DEEDS 1
(a) General Advantages.
Here the testimony from all countries is unanimous to show that
a good system of registration, a complete and practical one, excludes
fraud, cheapens transfer, facilitates business, is highly beneficial as
increasing the value of lands, and inducing a healthy state of credit.
On this general aspect of the matter we will only adduce a few very
creditable witnesses.
And, first of all, on a truly British colony, Nova Scotia.
John Bell, Esq., on Nova Scotia, says—They hold, in Nova Scotia, all lands under the
crown, principally by grants, but in the case of a few townships by plans and (what are
called) locations. The secretary of the province is also registrar general. In his office
these grants and locations are registered, but all other conveyances are registered in
the office of his deputies, of whom he has one in each county. The deputy provides at
his own expense the books for registry, &c.; his fees sfre one shilling for every 100 words,
one shilling for taking the oath of the witnesses, and about two shillings and sixpence
for the certificate of registration endorsed on the deed; of these fees the provincial
secretary receives about one shilling and twopence.
The system of registration there, with but few modifications, is the same throughout
all that was and now is British America, Lower Canada excepted, and the chief
objects in establishing it were these: —
Notoriety as to the title of every parcel.
Notoriety as to the charges affecting it.
Security against the loss of conveyances.
He continues—These ends have been generally obtained in all those countries, and
there is perhaps neither in the United States, the northern colonies, or the West Indies,
an institution more highly prized, or to which the inhabitants are more attached, than
this of the registry of deeds.
A party desirous of purchasing land resorts to the registry of the county, and, for a
trifling fee, and geneeallt without professional assistance, examines the line
of conveyances under which the premises are held, and from their simple forms can
generally form an accurate judgment whether he should proceed to or abandon his
purpose.
In like manner the money lender or creditor to whom a mortgage is offered can satisfy
himself of the sufficiency of the security offered. If professional aid be required in the
investigation, the expense is trifling from the facility of pursuing it, and with such
certainty can this in most cases be done, that the slightest defect generally occasions a
rejection of the offered security.
It is plain that under the system a mortgage by deposit of title deeds never takes place.
Forgeries of deeds are unheard of.
Wills are registered in the several counties in the courts of the probate. They are
therefore readily referred to.
The system thus briefly detailed has been found to work well and give great satisfaction
The deliberate opinion of London bankers and merchants has been
given in answer to the question :
Do you consider that the disclosure which an open register would
afford of mortgages and incumbrances would be productive of more
evil than good ?
“We think, upon general grounds, that any measure which tends to
prevent misconception and to secure accurate information respecting
the circumstances and property of commercial men, must, on the


whole, produce more good than evil; nor do we see reason to
apprehend any serious mischief from the disclosure which an open
registry would afford of mortgages and encumbrances, inasmuch as
we are confident that more mischief arises in the mercantile world
from false appearances of property and erroneous impressions as to
the real circumstances of parties, than from any other cause whatever.”
The Parliamentary Committee express themselves as follows :
Among the obvious advantages of such a measure are the restoration, with much
greater effect, of the principle of notoriety by the old feoffment with livery of seizin,
the establishment of a general public afid secure repository of title, precluding perhaps,
in a considerable degree, the necessity for expensive counterparts and copies, effectually
counteracting fraud, and contributing to the relief of the Court of Chancery.
We beg only to add, that we feel happy in the prospect of seeing
the Court of Chancery relieved of some of its burdens, such as
judging frequently on frauds, &c., and we feel no compunction, as
we see the new measure leading in the direction of a complete happy
annihilation of that Court. In whatever degree the introduction
of a general register diminishes the delay and expense , to the same
extent it will diminish the inducement by which parties are led to
adopt the security by deposit of deeds only, and enable them to avail
themselves of the more complete, and therefore more satisfactory
security.
(hj Particular Advantages of Registration compared with Legal
Incumbrances.
If we try the case between tacit or legal charges on land in France,
(to which dower is the precise counterpart) and registered ones in
other systems, the result is the same : and we select this subject as
involving interests that have a particular claim to public attention.
The matter of legal hypotheques may be briefly summed up. They
are all of them given with a view to protect such as, being unable to
protect themselves, would otherwise be left unprotected.
Being the remnant only of the very many general and latent
hypotheques privileged in the Civil Law; we have before shown,
how the code has nevertheless, besides abridging them essentially,
provided a way in most cases to secure a special inscription.
Still, as already before alluded to, legal hypotheques (for minors,
&c., and marriage portions, according to the law of the French) are
general, that is to say, they extend to all the immoveables, present
and to come, of the husband or guardian. And on this account,
certainly they often will escape the knowledge of an innocent
third person ; for although they are to be inscribed in a general way
once, at the time of the marriage or of the guardian taking the office
upon him, they may escape even in a diligent search to be noticed,
in consequence of subsequent sales of property, &c., and this so much
the more as there is no registry of ownership, and the indexes are
only alphabetically arranged.
We are led from this to perceive that the ancient principle
(practised in remotest antiquity, but most firmly established by


Charlemagne) of admitting of no hold whatever on lands except iw
the way of complete publicity is much more consistent and effectual,
both for the benefit of the wives and infants, and for that of the
innocent third purchaser. For where the unique simple rule of the
law is this, that no estate or real charge whatever can vest (inter
vivos) except by the public transaction, there any man, giving his
daughter away in marriage, either with a portion of certain lands or
with a charge on the lands of the husband, will take care of this at
the onset, and as for a guardian it would be impossible for him to
do anything at all with the lands of a minor except in a public way,
and as for his own lands it is not just that he should be allowed to
encumber them through his management of other property, except
in such a manner as to make it known. This principle therefore
has been revived with great propriety in the Prussian code of laws,
and in the Hanseatic statutes has never been lost sight of.
The Prussian code prohibits any latent claims from being charged
on immoveables; instead of those, it grants to such creditors as by the
civil law have general or privileged hypotheques, a mere title (as it
is called) to become registered on any certain immoveable, and by that
to gain the hypotheques, which, according to the Prussian law, can
only be created by the inscription. Although, at first sight this may
be thought to be no more than shift in theory, the immediate practical
consequence is, that hypotheques (of whatever origin) take pre-
cedence only according to the priority of their existence, that is from
the moment of their inscription on certain immoveable property,
and in consequence of this can only be special, and never general.
Wttetembeeg, like Bavaria, recognises a distinct hypotheque system, greatly to the
satisfaction of their people, the registrars being responsible, for instance, for all entries
made contrary to the rights of wives and minors, for whom they are bound to make the
necessary 'prenotations on the public books.
(c) Particular Advantages of Registration of Deeds compared untk
Unregistered Deeds.
The fundamental principle is certainly most consistently carried
out by vesting the interest by the public and not by the private act.
Yet, to a certain extent it may be guarded, even where deeds are as
yet left to have the effect of passing or vesting an estate, by fixing the
priority or precedence of conflicting claims strictly according to the
public act. We will therefore exemplify this also.
Hot only the German and Italian systems, but those also which the
American colonists have rigorously enacted for themselves, adhere
strictly to these two great marks of complete and consistent regis-
tration : speciality of the object and priority of time of registration.
In the Hanse Towns, Prussia, &c., in Hew York, Hova Scotia,
all over the United States and the West Indies, except Louisiana
and Hayti, the practice is to register the claims and amounts pre-
cisely in the order as they are presented, and to let them take one
after another—the former always to the exclusion of the latter—
according t® the strict priority of entry.


John Bell, on “Nova Scotia,” says :—“ By positive law the first
conveyance registered takes priority. This rule obliges the grantee to
proceed to register the deed to him immediately after its execution.”
This latter course is more consistent in theory, and practically
enables the creditor to see and apportionate his risk more precisely.
It is also more convenient at the sales and adjustment of claims.
Pazzini informs us that this has been fully recognised in Italy.
In Lombaedt the registration of hypotheques is that introduced by the French code,
and which has been recalled into activity even where it had been abolished through
hatred of all innovations, “ the general feeling being that the only fault of the French
system was of not going far enough in point of publicity, leaving too many legal
hypotheques and privileges which can claim priority without being inscribed and made
public. Priority of registration as between hypotheques is therefore made exclusive
of notice in Lombardy and the keeper of the register is bound to indemnify the parties
against the effects of his mistakes. It appears, also, that entails having been revised in
Italy, they are void as against registered parties in default of registration.
Having thus far elucidated the assurance of propertylby regis-
tration (either with or without vesting the estate by deed), it only
remains to examine the most important question of all :
HOW REGISTRATION WOULD WORK WITHOUT ANY DEEDS.
Let us first clearly understand the thing at issue. “ Deeds,” as
applied to transfers of immoveables, are those sealed and delivered
writings by which law allows at present, not a mere contract or
agreement but the actual passing and setting over of the property
itself from one party to another effectually.
On the other hand, there are indeed many and very respectable
communities who have never been driven to resort to such costly and
cumbrous expedients, or when they had become entangled in the
meshes, cut through the trance and freed themselves again by
making it the law that the property, or terms, or charges in land,
shall be vested simply (on dealing with the land before the registrar,
either orally or by simple writings) by having the transaction recorded.
This, then, is the main distinction between the two systems—the
one makes it at once plain, safe, cheap, and effective—the other
clogs it with unnecessary, burdensome, and dangerous formalities.
But we cannot decide upon this issue more clearly or forcibly than
by simply asking the reader to endorse the verdict already pronounced
by most respectable organs of public opinion, both at the antipodes
and with us.
Speaking of the practicability of assimilating the mode of trans-
ferring land to the mode of transferring stock in the funds, or to
the mode of transferring property in ships, which has lately been
adopted with so much success, the Daily News, of December 2, states
the advantages of that principle, by which the estate is vested, not
through the private agreement but exclusively by the public act, in
the following words :
In the case of stock, for instance, all a purchaser has to do is to pay his money to the
persons whose names appear as proprietors in the hooks of the Bank or England, and to
have his substituted for theirs. This vests the stock in him as against all the world. So
in the case of ships. Let a purchaser pay his money to the person whose name appears


upon the register and get his own placed there, the result will be that the new purchaser
will henceforth be absolute owner against all the world. In this instance, it will be
observed, there is no need of tracing back the history of the stock or of the ship for any
length of time. All a purchaser has to do is to ascertain who is the registered proprietor.
Now it is proposed that the same rule shall be applied to land. The person who is the
registered proprietor shall have absolute power to dispose of the land in question. If any
purchaser pays his money to the registered proprietor, and gets himself placed on the
register, he shall be deemed proprietor.”
Our South Australian Register adds—
We can, of course, easily forsee that special provisions will be needed to meet the var-
ious contingencies arising out of trusts, settlements, incumbrances, &c.; but these
difficulties can easily be met, nor are they half so formidable as they are frequently
represented to be by those who are directly and pecuniarily interested in magnifying
small difficulties and inventing fresh ones where none existed before.
The Register continues to animadvert with just severity on the
practical uselessness and positive mischief of the opposite principle
in the following words :
It was never yet known that technicality and verbiage diminished difficulty or removed
obscurity. It has been remarked that there are two sorts of metaphysics, the one making
easy things hard, the other making hard things easy. We take about the same view of
legal expositions. If they are brief and simple, difficulties will be elucidated; if they are
prolix and technical, difficulties will be increased. Therefore the more contingencies and
liabilities there are as affecting the tenure of landed property, the more reason is there
for doing away with the present cumbrous and antiquated systenl, which, under pretence
of making assurance doubly sure, makes obscurity doubly obscure.
The London Daily News is then further quoted in the following
terms, showing what will be our doom too, if we do not take up the
very root of the evil: —
Many of us have had occasion to buy or sell a house or a piece of land. Upon such an
occasion did you ever happen to see what is quaintly termed the ‘ Abstract of Title ’ lying
on your lawyers table f It consists generally of one, two, or three bundles of blue paper,
which contain an abstract of all the deeds and documents referring to the house or land
to be sold during at the very least sixty years. This ‘brief chronicle’ contains, in fact,
the history of the property during more than half a century; though, indeed, it is far from
unusual to have the history recorded for a much longer period. This abstract of deeds—
which of course, considering its mere length, is not prepared without considerable expense
—is forthwith dispatched to council. It then becomes the business of that learned and
ingenious person to satisfy himself that the seller has what is called a good title to the
property which he has contracted to sell For this purpose he goes carefully through the
various documents submitted to him. Having fixed upon some starting point—upon
some person who was absolute owner of the property in question—he traces its devolution
though all the deaths, sales, mortgages, leases, settlements, and every sort of dealing of
the various successive owners, and in short endeavours to satisfy himself that the person
who has undertaken to sell the property has such a legal right as will enable him to do
so. Thus, if I have undertaken to sell you my house, No. 9, Southdown-square, absolutely
—or,as the lawyears would say, the fee-simple thereof—the council must satisfy himself
that I have a good sixty years’ title. The evidence disclosed by the abstract must show
a series of proprietors of the house in question, from one or more of which it must appear
that I have derived the property. Now, it is easy to understand the host of difficulties to
which any such investigation must give rise. The time is long. The interest which the
law permits to be carved out of the same land are numerous. Questions often arise
whether the proper legal document and the proper forms have been employed for the
purpose of transferring the peculiar rights. Purchasers are exposed to all sorts of frauds.
Money may have been lent to former sellers, and lenders of the money may, without any
knowledge on the part of the purchasers, have aquired rights over the property. In short,
the difficulties which attend the present mode of transferring land are almost infinite.”
Common sense rebels against the ridiculous and expensive forma-
lities of the law. In Australia or in England the study of this
question not only awakens the same train of thought, but most
conclusively points out the root of the evil, which is, the necessity
of tracing the title back through a labyrinth that can never be
dispensed with so long as the estate is vested by the private writing
(whatever its name), and not by public registration.
Contrast now with this the practical perfection to which regis-
tration of ownership can be carried out. The peculiarity of the


Censo is that it offers a perfect instance of commercial book-keeping,
as applied to land. The register proper, or catasto, is the traders’
inventory, in which the individual properties are described by number
in topographical order. Then comes a ledger , in which the names
of the various proprietors are entered in alphabetical order, with a
separate account to each of all the lands that he holds ; whilst the
daily alterations are noted down upon a journal (so called giomale),
in which a purchaser is bound, under a heavy fine, to have his
purchase deed registered within a certain period, but this is not
done until such documents and other information are produced by
the parties as are necessary to prove clearly that the vendor sold and
had a right to sell, and that the purchaser bought the identical
property. Alterations are then made in the ledger, by subtraction
from the account of the vendor and addition to that of the purchaser,
or by opening a new account, as the case may be. On the death of
a proprietor registration does not take place in the name of the
devisee or heir until proof either of the will, or of the intestacy, and
of the heirship of the party claiming.
Surely when we come to see such plain dealings in land exem-
plified quite as well as in ships, and mentally compare its results with
the retrospect on abstracts (a truly retrograde movement) or with the
prospect now before us (according to some whispers in the council
hall) of having an indemnity fund formed against the blunders of the
lawyers from the money of the landowners—we cannot help exclaim-
ing then that PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE.
This is clearly proved in the case of INCUMBRANCES
AS well as OWNERSHIP.
Arthur Young says, with respect to the Censimento in the Milanese:
“As it is at present, the land owners are well satisfied; for it gives an accuracy and
security to property that is of no slight value, as all mutations are made in reference to
the parochial map of the censimento.”
From the Bavarian Code we will quote the rightful principle,
clearly expressed in the following words :
“ Hypotheque is a right real upon the moveables of another, which a creditor acquires
for the security of his demand by inscription upon the book of hypothec.’ ’
And again—
“To constitute a hypothec there needs, first, a title of acquisition, legal or conven-
tional: second, inscriptions of the claim upon the registers. Title alone does not
confer htpotheque, but merely the right to acquire it by inscription on the register.
Even if the possession of the thing, or the usufruct be given to the creditor for the
security of his demand, hypotheque is, nevertheless, not acquired.
Specific instances of this are pointed out in the case of the reser-
vations of a right of property on alienations (i.e. the vendor’s lien
for purchase money) and that of a right of repurchase, neither of
which, unless registered, are available.
The reader may fully rely on the statement of a well known capitalist
nqw amongst us, but who has been in the habit for many years of
dealing largely and successfully on his own account, both here and in
Hamburg, in buying and selling lands for himself, and also in the
investing of capital in the lands of others. To speak of such dealings


only as are of daily use in this colony, he states the case as follows :
—ln 1840 A. bought section No. 100, in the hundred of Adelaide,
containing eighty acres, and in 1841 he sold the same to 8., who,
in 1844, borrowed on its security XIOO of C., and in 1846, XI2O
of D. on the same property. In 1847 C. sold his XIOO to E., and
in 1848 B. sold the property to D. D. paid to E. his XlOO in 1851,
and in the same year he sold twenty-five acres of the section to F.,
and in 1852 the remaining portion to G. G. went to the diggings
and of him or his documents nothing is heard till 1867, when H. (G’s.
son) finds it necessary to have his right to the section authenticated,
and resorts to certain proceedings according to the statute in such
case made and provided.
General Outline of Registration in Hamburg.
There are two records kept, checking one another—the first being
the list of what is called die verlassung, that is, of .notices publicly
given of any transactions intended to affect an immoveable; the
other, the hook, in which the transactions are finally entered. The
booking is kept as concisely and exact as mercantile experience can
make it, and has the public confidence to the fullest extent. The
preliminary public notices are, as yet, given in a somewhat old-
fashioned form, about in the following way :—•
1840. Jan. 10—In a public audience at the senate-house,* the horn
the commissioners of public lands, release section No. 100, &c.,
containing 80 acres, &c., to A.— (ln der qfentlichen Verlassung auf
dem Rath-hause die Lobliche Gammerei verldsst die section No. 100,
enthaltend 80 akker, &c., an den A.)
Or, in the case of a money charge—
-1844. May s.—ln a public audience, &c., B. giveth notice of
charging XIOO at 10 per cent, interest on section No. 100, &c., pay-
able to C. (B. Idsst anrufen XIOO zm 10 per cent, in der section No.
100, dec., fur C.J
These notices being previously left at the offices by the parties or
their agents, the list is made up by the officials, and publicly read
over at stated times ; but the transactions cannot be booked within
the next fourteen days after the “ public audience then, if no
protest is entered, the parties go to the office personally, and have it
recorded on the book of the city, which is conclusive, and vests the
estate and interest against all the world. On that book the trans-
actions in the above case would then appear simply thus—
Vol. XVI.] Section No. 100, in the Hundred [Folio 8.
a.d. | month. 1 °f Adelaide, containing 80 acres.
1840. Jan. 24—The above section is hereby recorded as being the
property of A.
1841. Oct. 9 —The same section is recorded as the property of B.
• If the section were in a district, it would read “in the district office. ”


1844. May 19 —£100 and interest 10 per cent, are hereby recorded
as a charge on the same section for C., with the priority before any
of tiie following.
1846. Oct. 6—£120 and interest at per cent, are hereby
recorded as a charge on the same section for D., with the priority
before any following.
1847. Jan. s—Those £lOO charged on the above section for C.
are hereby transferred to E.
1848. Feb. 6—All the above section is hereby recorded as being
the property of D.; and those £lOO charged on the same section for
D. are hereby cancelled.
1851. March s—Those £lOO charged on the above section for E.
are hereby cancelled.*
1851. Oct. 7 —All that part of the above section, containing about
twenty-five acres, which is bounded on the west by section No. 99,
&c., is hereby recorded as being the property of F.
1852. Jan. 21—All that part of the above section recorded as the
property of D., containing about fifty-five acres, is hereby recorded
as transferred and being the property of G.t
1868. Jan. 7 —After legal notices and proclamations certified, &c.,
those 55 acres, recorded as the property of G., have been decreed,
and they are hereby recorded as being the property of H.
A few explanations will suffice—-
1. The authorities at Hamburg consider it of the highest im-
portance to keep the public book of the hereditaments and investments
on the same, both safe and efficient. For this purpose
2. The secretaries of the city, as conductors of this department, are
sworn, and have to find heavy securities, and never admit of a
final entry on the “ books ” except on the personal attendance and
consent of the transferor or his certain attorney, with one or two citizens
known to the acting officer. The citizens mostly conduct their
business in this line themselves, but to save time and trouble usually
employ these “sworn house-brokers ,, (he-eidigte Hausmakler) who form
a highly respectable class of agents.
3. These are sworn to their duties; admitted only by the chamber
of commerce (das lobliche comercium) ; also removeable by the same
at any time; and strictly regulated by certain laws, which are revised
from time to time by the citizens.
4. House property and investments therein being extremely useful
* Now mark well: If D does not quit claim to his £lOO, they remain standing
in Us name, i. e., the advanta&e of priority remains his—the owner s—to transfer
to whosoever he likes, without disturbing any of the following creditors.
f Upon the making over of these twenty-five acres as a separate property to P, they
are immediately entered on a separate folio, thus:
Yol. XVI.] Portion of Section No. 100, in the Hundred of Adelaide, [Polio 60.
containing 25 acres.
1851. In the seventh audience D hath made over those twenty-five acres, &c. (precisely
as in fol 8) to P.; then if F. encumbers this property, his charges are entered on this
folio; then any transactions affecting these twenty-five acres must be entered on
this folio.


in Hamburg, nothing is allowed to affect them legally, unless it
appear on the face of the book in the proper form ; —the law being
that no evidence can be brought against the city s books.
5. Every separate hereditament has its separate folium.
6. Every money charge has its separate entry on the same.
7. No new name is admitted except by consent, or by decree (in
cases of descent, absence of owners, &c. In such cases title by
notice and non-claim is established by law much the same as in
Canada).
8. Long clauses between creditor and debtor are altogether un-
necessary : inasmuch as any of these money-charges on house property
is considered to fall due for payment upon six months’ notice in
writing. But there is never any difficulty in obtaining money to
change hands, so long as the property is good. Also, compulsory
sales are regulated by law.
9. This facility and safety of business would be immediately
destroyed if any charges unknown on the book, were ever allowed to
affect the land, or if ever the order in which they stand were allowed
to be disturbed.
10. But the order of their priority is so strictly adhered to, that
it is a common thing for an owner of a house in Hamburg, upon
paying out a creditor, not to cancel the sum on the book, but have
it, as in his own name, on hand, for the purpose of transferring it to
others, to the same amount and priority. In this way every lender
can see the precise amount of his risk at all times, business is safe,
and capital changed in any sum, small or great, on reasonable terms.
N.B.—lf only part of the sum of money is to be transferred, the
notice of this is preserved on the book by adding the words with
the same priority as £— &c., registered for N. N., &c.
10. (a) When an hereditament is divided the new folium cannot
be opened but by consent or satisfaction of the creditors on the book.
If any of them be absent, without having left his certain proxy to
act for him at the book, the remedy is by public notice and non-claim,
and in certain cases by depositing the money.
11. Our readers will be curious to know about the “public
audiences'' They are what is called die ceffentliche Verlassung auf
dem Rathhause —held at stated times quite publicly in the senate
house (or in the district offices) by the officials, who read over in
public the lists of all changes entered since the last preceding audi-
ence, while the agents and other bystanders listen, or else talk of
their business amongst themselves. (These audiences are the
descendants, in a straight line, of the old folk-gemot, to which they
have as quietly succeeded in their own way in Hamburg, as the
ballot now succeeds the nomination by show of hands with us.)
12. Upon completing the purchase at the book the purchaser


gets a new certificate of the entry, with the incumbrances stated
about in this way—
Date. Section No. 100, bounded, &c., is recorded as being the
property of A. B.
The following charges are recorded thereon :
£l,OOO with interest at , &c., for C. D. with the priority before
the following.
£5OO. &c., for E. F., with the same priority as the next following
£5OO.
£5OO, &c., for G. H., with the same priority as the next preceding
£5OO.
Signature of officer.
The person entitled to the money charged upon the house receives
a certificate (called an extract) simply to this effect—
No. of property. On this property £lOO with interest at, &c.,
are recorded for E. F., with the priority before the following (or,
with the same priority as £— as the case may be).
Signed, &c.
Neither of these certificates avail for anything further than to
show the transaction. A deposit of it can never affect the land.
12. (a) It is easy to perceive that this system is based on the ad-
mission of rent charges on immoveables without changing the estate;
but is improved in process of time to suit a commercial community,
and will be readily adopted in its most useful features, wherever the
freeholders and general public will take care of their own laws as
well as the Hamburg freeholders have done.
We must now proceed to a somewhat painful duty—to compare
with each other the transactions under book-keeping and by con-
veyancing. We have, however, a public duty to perform in this,
and shall not shrink from doing it.

These statements are true to life. There is the supposition of the
same property and of the same amount of capital borrowed in both
cases. The same events in life, a father giving an allotment to his
daughter on her marriage in 1840. In 1841 her husband buys a
section. In 1844 he borrows £100 on it at 10 per cent., leaving
the town allotment of his wife as yet unencumbered. To authenti-
cate all this has cost, under the book system, £2 15s.; under the
conveyancing system (from the first grant), £17 Is.; and while,
under the book system, he is perfectly free to charge his property
with more, according to its value and credit, his section, under the
conveyancing system, is at once blocked up,
Now in 1845 he finds it necessary to look for more money.
Conveyance by deed and register :
conveyancing system, is at once blocked up,
Now in 1845 he finds it necessary to look for more money.
Under the book system he gets, without any difficulty, and without
the slightest risk of undue advantages to be taken against him in
the money market, £BO more on his section at per cent, (the
second priority). This second creditor knows his risk precisely ;he
has charged his interest accordingly, and he knows that the first
charge can never hurt him. The owner, too, can, in the same pre-
cise way, with his wife’s free concurrence, obtain another moderate
amount, at 10 per cent., on his wife’s allotment. They have thus
got the capital they want into their hands, and remain masters of it
and op their estates the same as before.
But under the mortgage ? B. now finds to his cost that his pro-
perty is locked up; for the mortgagee stoutly refuses to admit of


any further charge, neither on his own nor any body else’s account,
B. and his wife go to the trustee of the allotment, and the three
together go and deposit the deeds thereof with a money order for
£6O at 20 per cent. ; but, as this is not enough, they go to a
stretch and make a bill of sale to the same persons for £4O, which,
taking ample security, he lets them have at only 15 per cent.
These becoming due in 1846, R. S. having the bill of sale
registered, as B. manages to pay the interest and costs, R. S. sees
fit to assist him, so far as to take, not a transfer of the mortgage for
the £lOO, adding the £6O to it, but a fresh mortgage for the whole
amount, at 15 per cent. —keeping the deeds since deposited as col-
lateral security too. While B. now looks very ruefully back upon
the costs and interest paid, and upon the shackled condition he is
in, the same as the property, under the conveyancing system, 8.,
under the book-keeping system, is a true freeholder yet, and, count-
ing the money he has saved with his wife, they go and actually
reduce the debt on her allotment to the half of its original amount.
They have debts on their two properties—£l2o at 10 per cent.,
and £BO at 12^ —without any danger, the charge on the section
being £lBO, on the allotment £2O, to different creditors. Under
the other system they are, with all their deeds, in one man’s hands,
and, having no legal estate whatever, are impoverished, and have had
difficulty in saving even their personal goods.
These things, we repeat, are only matters of the most ordinary
occurrence, leaving it to others for the present to point out the wilful
frauds, suppressions, or misapplication of deeds, &c., which have also
occurred and are by no means rare. Our legislators, no doubt, will
feel their responsibility when tracing fully the consequences of the
parallel thus indicated to ponder well the heavy drawbacks on the
farmer’s and the industrious trader’s prosperity, and the guilt of the
evils practically legalised in the community through the practice of
vesting the estates in lands by conveyancers.
SECTION 11.
Registration in South Australia —its Legal Effects and Practical
Results. Statistics.
From the preceding remarks it results, that we can understand
registration in two ways—first, as now in vogue, viz., the registering
of documents by which the land is passed ; and, secondly, by the
attendance of the parties or their agents dealing with the land before
the registrar (or his substitutes), and their sale or incumbrance then
and there duly registered.
The first of these is the mode enacted with South Australians in
the first place by 5 Vic. No. 8, 1842, five years too late for the
colony, and a variety of subsequent acts. The other mode is clearly
and essentially adopted in the measure which has been read before


the House of Assembly a first time at the motion of a gentleman, whom
we may be permitted to call by his most popular name—Mr. Torrens.
It is obvious, however, that his bill is intended to apply per-
manently indeed to all lands as shall be sold by government hereafter,
but with regard to any that were granted by the crown prior to the
passing of this bill, only to such lands as are admitted, in compliance
with the desire of the owner, to come under its operation—its author
therefore seems to be conscious of conferring by it some benefit; but
it follows that if there be any that would rather “that things remain
as they are,” they would not be interfered with in regard of lands
granted before the Act.
It therefore becomes necessary at any rate to exhibit a review of
our present system of registration.
This is to be gathered from the following enactments, now in force
in South Australia :
5 Yic., No. B—Act to provide for the Registration of Deeds,
Wills, Judgments, Conveyances, and other Instruments. (Exclusive
of leases not exceeding three years.) t sysrz 6 /Z
1852. No. 19—An Act to amend an Act to provide for the
Registration of Deeds, Wills, Conveyances, and other Instruments.
1853. No. 22—Act to provide for the Deposit of Deeds, Agree-
ments, Writings and Assurances, Maps and Plans, relating to
Hereditaments in the Province of South Australia, and for other
purposes therein mentioned.
1854. No. 19—To amend the Law relating to the Registration,
Enrolment, and Deposit of Wills and other Deeds and Instruments.
1855. No. 23—Act to amend the Law relating to the Registration
of Land Grants and to provide for the Prepayment of the Registration
Fees chargeable thereon.
The general aspect of their workings will be readily perceived from
the table (see appendix).
The number of bills of sale, warrants of attorney, and judgments
during the same time are also there shown.
We will treat in order—
(a) Of our present method of registration, its objects and effects.
(h) Of its fees and establishment.
(a) Our present method of registration, to speak the candid
truth, is of many colours, but, unlike Joseph’s coat, not woven
together in fast colours, as one garment, but patched up, stitched,
and tacked on in three or four different ways—a striking illustration
of the impolicy of passing an act to amend an act passed for the
amendment of an act, &c.
Our instruments are registered either (1) by memorial , about 8,000
yearly; or (2) by enrolment, about 480 yearly; or (3) by deposit
of deed, .about 444 yearly; or (4) by duplicate of deed (the land
grants in 1856.) Now, as this does not supersede deeds, but is only


superadded to them, reminding us of an unfortunate second-hand
mortgagee, who has got himself tacked on, to be carried along (at his
own proper costs) with the broad engrossed legal documents—it will
be high time indeed to call aloud for public attention to the mag-
nitude of the interests clogged and involved in the grasp of this
endless scretv, which, however, is not applied with propelling force.
We call the reader’s attention—the attention of the general public,
as well as the legislator, to the following return of the

We will now examine—
(1) Registration by Memorial.
The greatest bulk of the deeds —the same as bills of sale, judg-
ments, and warrants of attorney —are registered, as yet, under 5 Vic.
No. 8, i. e., by memorials, which are numbered strictly in the order
in which they come in, and bound up in books, and must contain,
according to clause 7, the dates, names, and additions of parties and
witnesses and their abodes*, the nature of the deed, and the parcels :
These being the only contents peremptorily enjoined by the act.
The registrar is nevertheless bound to see to the accuracy, and has a
right to refuse, not the numbering and filing of the memorial itself,
but to certify its correctness on the d"feed. This no doubt is a check
on the persons preparing the memorial, yet notwithstanding this
double machinery, the memorial is not to be considered as evidence
* This was repealed by subsequent Act, No. 19,1854.


of all its contents, but only of those the act has declared, as above,
to be necessary. According to legal advice had, it does not even
override legal notice (see clauses 3 and 39). The memorial
therefore, so long at least as the deed cannot be shown to have been
destroyed (clause 24), is of no further use than what the most simply
constructed journal would do much better, to fix the dates and
priority of transactions, and the parcels ; hut so far only as it can be
done without proof of the execution, covenants, &c., &c., of our
deeds. It also serves as some clue to the deed, enabling parties to
see their way more clearly in enforcing the right they may have to
compel production, and putting other parties on their guard. But
beyond this its use does not extend.
Although it cannot therefore be properly contended, that our me-
morials are “worse than useless,” they are nevertheless like all
systems of registration by memorial —referential only, that is, the
record is not complete in itself, but requires completion by some
other instrument, and should this be lost, it gives very excellent
chances for brave but unsuccessful litigation.
Unregistered instruments dating prior to the Act of 1841 are as
yet constantly turning up to unsettle subsequent purchases.
Even now to register is quite optional with the party —the diffe-
rence being only this, that registered instruments are protected
against unregistered or subsequently registered ones (though prior
in date) by the provision in the Act that these should be declared
-fraudulent and void as against the former. After a lapse of one
month from the date of the instrument the fees increase 5 shillings
per month, but only for the next six months.*
Wills, to come under the effect of the Act, must be registered
within six months from the testator’s decease (if in South Australia),
or two years (if upon or beyond the seas), or, at the latest (in case
of inevitable impediments), within three years from the decease.
By the Act 6 Yict. ISTo. 12, instruments executed in New South
Wales , Van Diemen's Land , or any part of Australia out of the pro-
vince, take precedence from their own dates, if registered in three
months; from any other part of the world, within twelve months
from their date.
(2) Registration by Enrolment.
Enrolment being a transcript of the deed at length, combined
with proof of its execution before the registrar on oath, vivd voce —•
certainly a method much superior in itself—is but rarely resorted to
in this colony ; and this is no wonder, considering the very formid-
able length and complication «of the deeds in use with by tar the
greater number of the gentlemen admitted as legal practitioners at
our Supreme Court; though in Nova Scotia, J. Bell tells us, the
* Building Societies are exempt from this by schedule A. to Act No. 19 of 1852.


same as in the United States, the deeds have become reduced to
much greater conciseness and simplicity (in consequence of registra-
tion) ; though a minority of practitioners have begun to apply the
same abbreviating process in the deeds, and enlist the service of the
printing press to furnish deeds for the building societies, &c., here.
The proportion of enrolled (and proved) deeds to the others is as
Ito 17. Enrolment is only additional to the memorial.
The effect of enrolment is to make covenant for production of cer-
tified copies unnecessary (clause 22), even though the covenant was
in the deed {Act No. 19 of 1854, clause 4), and office copies to
stand good instead of the deed itself for production in court. These
important effects are extended to all deposited instruments by No. 19
of 1852 (clause 4), and No. 22 of 1853 (clauses 2—4), and No. 23
of 1855.
The indexes under the first Act were only alphabetical. The
inefficiency of that plan became so apparent as to make a vote for
.£7OO necessary to have the numbers and description of the sections
added in the indexes opposite the names. In this manner 70,000
properties were extracted, which, perhaps, shows the number of
changings or mutations in land gone through in about eleven years
(from the commencement of the registry to Act of 1852, No. 19).
In consequence of the monopoly of the profession, the public gene-
rally are here kept in such gross ignorance of these matters that
even the proving of the deed before the registrar—such as the Act
admits in any other case as well (see clause 5) —is seldom or never
resorted to; people are but too glad, when they have got over the heavy
expenses of other steps, to hear that no further proof is wanted,
although they will have to pay much more afterwards, when, in case
of litigation, the deed must be proved before the court.
It is most evidently wanted for the South Australian colonists to
regulate these matters through an instrumentality calculated to work
out, at least, completeness, simplicity, and permanency of proof,
and this quite as readily and cheaply, expeditiously, too, as it is
done on the basis of popular enactment in British and Republican
America. We will not say democratical enactments, for our profes-
sional men —in whose hands these things have hitherto been left,
until Mr Torrens has boldly stepped forward in the breach for the
people—would not like us to call the enactments hitherto framed
for the regulation of the legal profession in the exercise or their
functions as agents for the people, aristocratical. Those enactments,
indeed, are not bureaucratical either ; they are simply monopolistical.
Very unmistakeably so, indeed, by the letter of the enactment
(See Act for the regulation of the Legal Profession in 1845, No. (i),
and very excessively, too, in the spirit of its operation (see your
lawyer’s bills).

cate (clause 15), but this also is seldom resorted to, reconveyance
being the prevalent practice, except under the Building Societies
Act (1850).
There is, in fact, no excuse whatever for this, since, by the Act
No. 22 o/1853, it is expressly provided that entry of certificate of
satisfaction of mortgage in the margin of its registry shall be suffi-
cient evidence of revesting the estate. Still the lucrative practice
of reconveying is kept up.
If hon. members take it in hand to advise with the country
through organs such as the Chamber of Commerce and others
in a position, not only to know, but also to feel and act upon
the people’s practical wants ; no doubt but the agency of the people
in the registration business will be placed on a popular basis,
without in the slightest degree endangering its solidity. It is not
to be doubted but the people themselves feel keenly by this time
that they never will be free, so long as the yoke of a monopolizing
class is not cast off, so long as the agency of the transfers and
encumbrances is not placed into the hands of men that are approved
of as being readily responsible and plain-dealing in their business.
As to the registration of judgments, bills of sale, and the impor-
tant branch of liens on wool and mortgages of sheep, cattle, and
horses, made valid by registration without delivery to the mort-
gagee (Act No. 4, 1855-6), we can here only glance at the statistics
of this branch. There were—
All these vast securities are effected simply by the means of
official registration by memorial.
The two remaining methods of registration of deeds , viz. :
(3) By deposit of the original.
(1) By deposit of duplicate, adopted in a general way by Act
No. 22 of 1853, and in No. 23 of 1855-6, although infinitely more
useful than registration by memorial, have, as yet, been very
sparingly been resorted to—the originals deposited being chiefly
powers of attorney, and the duplicates almost only land grants under
clause 18 of 1841 and the act last mentioned, which indeed was the
first step in the right direction.
So long as any sort of mere private writings or deeds shall remain
* In 1855 no preferable lien act was in force,


the means of vesting estate in the lands, we cannot very well like to
part with an original deed. Respecting duplicates this feeling does
not exist; and still they serve for proof as well as originals, if they
are made to be truly duplicates, and, before the registrar, proved as
in America, and deposited.
Hence the very great facility afforded by the printing press in our
highest assurance—land grants, under the act of 1855-6, which has
made it compulsory to register them by deposit of their duplicates.
As this effectually dispenses at one stroke with memorials, costly
penmanship, and loss of deeds, it is evident that a free people have
the most obvious interest and right to demand that the same method
should be carried throughout the whole of this department; provided
always, that people who fancy to have a deed done up at great length
and complication, may do so, at their own costs and risk; provided
nevertheless, they deposit also a duplicate of it, in the public registry
office, to enable other people to ascertain also those costs and risks,
which may belong to them.
The Establishment
Consists in the Registrar-General and his deputy, who are sworn and
empowered to conduct the system and administer oaths under the
acts, and who are responsible for wilful neglect of duty or any
fraudulent practice in the execution of the office to the amount of
treble damages and full costs of suit (clause 26 of 1841), to be
recovered by action of debt in the Supreme Court.
The establishment, inclusive of clerks and all books and fittings,
costs the public a great deal less than the amount of the fees allowed
by the various acts. So—

The Proposed Reformatory Measures.
(A) The Government Propositions.
(B) Mr. Torrens's Bill.
(A) Government Proposals — lnadequate.
The opening speech of the first*South Australian parliament,
congratulatory on the financial aspects of the country, and sufficiently
full of information in other respects ; is barely touching on the
subject of law r reform by promising a bill to amend the law of real


property, which will provide for the distribution of landed property
in cases of intestacy in the same manner as personal property is now
distributed, and will simplify the evidence of title by shortening the
period within which actions for the recovery of land may be brought,
and will afford facilities for settling doubtful or disputed titles a
bill for amending the insolvent law ; and a bill for increasing the
number of judges and enlarging the sphere of duties of the supreme
court by providing for the establishment of circuit courts..
The new Insolvency Act having become matured in its own way
and department, which latter has the advantage in taking the most
forcible effect, whenever the effects of its immediate subjects are
smallest; the general law department will doubtless follow this
laudable example, by carrying out abolition of primogeniture, es-
tablishing circuit courts, and shortening the limitation of actions on
real property, so as to fall in with the great trunk-line of law-reform,
which is the simplification of transfers.
We are forcibly borne out in this view by an observation of the
British parliamentary committee on conveyancing : —“ If in con-
nection with registration (they say) provision were made for shortening
the periods of limitation in certain cases, as against registered titles,
under conditions of publicity or (public) notices, we believe much
might be done to accelerate the beneficial operations of a register.”
Whether in Britain, or its colonies, or foreign parts, everywhere
registration of transfers is uppermost in the public mind, and without
heartily falling in with this view which the public take on the
subject, first and foremost of all, the law department of a government
in this age cannot be in a position to exercise that influence, to
which the vastness of the interests under its supervision should
entitle it.
But the session of 1855-1856 having been crowned with measures
of much practical import, which are modifications of British Acts,
such as (No. 7) an Act to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the
conveyance and transfer of real and personal property vested in mort-
gagees and tmistees , it would be ungracious in us to remind the law
department of the words delivered at the opening of that memorable
session (Nov. 1, 1855) by the Governor-in-Chief in person, with
that completeness and urbanity of expression which is characteristic
of His Excellency :
“As connected with the subject of Law Reform, one measure which
I have directed to be introduced, deserves special mention, as being
of great importance to the smaller class of landed proprietors here.
The Bill I allude to provides, that landed property, not specifically
bequeathed or otherwise settled, shall be distributed in like manner
as personal property. Whilst it always has appeared to me unjust,
and tending to limit the desire for accumulating property natural to


the inhabitants of a free commercial state, that any law (as is the
case in some countries) should prevent a person from bequeathing
his property according to his own wishes, it can scarcely be regarded
in principle less objectionable, that where such person has made no
specific bequest, the law should give the whole of his landed pro-
perty to one member of his family, to the exclusion of the rest, and
against the natural presumption of the deceased’s wishes. I believe
some cases of great hardship have occurred in this colony under the
existing lawq and therefore anticipate that you will agree with me in
thinking that where no will has been made, the general law should
operate simply as an equitable substitute for a will in reference
to all the property of the intestate.”
The Council fully concurred, and corresponded to these views as
being popular and just; but nothing further came of it in effect.
As regarding these measures, which practically touch all classes, the
whole of that session was Vox el prasterea nihil.
The danger to be guarded against, therefore, is, that practical im-
provements in the law must not be allowed so to be shelved again.
With a view to the establishment of county courts, we may
hope that the institution of Parliament will become eminently
recommended to the people by making this an opportunity for
thoroughly revising the whole of the code of proceedings and
fees of the gentlemen who are to become entitled to advocate law
and equity in such ambulating courts. May all concerned feel it to
be their bounden duty to look to this, because circuit courts, with-
out intelligible arrangements of the pleadings and fees, would only
tend to make the people more involved in litigation, and more help-
lessly depending on their legal advisers, whilst rendering them less
able to support the machinery of such advice with adequate pecu-
niary remuneration.
Sound and safe as the principle is of trial by jury—both grand
and common jury—and needed quite as much in civil cases as on
the criminal side, we beg to repeat that, except under such arrange-
ments as would be intelligible to the people, the instrumentality of
circuit courts would increase litigation and its expenses, instead of
becoming a means of diminishing both, and this notwithstanding
the promised shortening of the periods of limitation to actions for
the recovery of real property.
In connection with a simple and sufficient system of registration,
no doubt can exist but that the effect of short periods for actions
on real property would be beneficial; but a most abortive hope it
would be to expect a reform in the theory or practice of the law to
result from merely affording more opportunities for the application
of the instrumentality, which at present is most costly and intricate,
of the Supreme Court, and from creating more intense desires for


contesting doubtful titles by shortening the periods for their de-
cision.
There is, indeed, a point of view higher still.
As a general observation, we feel that we are justified in remark-
ing that in a new community, such as ours, it would be unwise, in
the highest acceptation of the term, to think of no other or better
instrumentality than litigation on adverse possession for the clearing
up of titles to the lands. Starting, as we have done, from the be-
ginning, and starting still, with original surveys, by means of which
every eighty-acre section and many smaller parcels are mapped, and
carrying forward a complete list of the first grantees of every sepa-
rate piece at every sale effected for the Crown—enjoying a tenure,
too, the most complete and free that ever was—this colony certainly
ought to have been kept free from the beginning of any confusion of
titles to land; and if adverse possession crept in, it ought never to
have been welcomed in the recesses of a legal labyrinth, not built by
a Minos, representing amongst us the ruined castles of the feudal
age ; for adverse possession will never be welcomed by an intelligent
and moral community as a means, and the means to be proposed
by their government, to prevent confusion of titles—
Procul, procul, esta profani !
An intelligent, commercial, and industrious community, has other
requirements to meet paramount in the public mind, and other ex-
pedients to adopt welcomed by the public voice. Those require-
ments are rectitude of the possessor, certainty and correctness of title,
clearness and precision of rights, and dispatch of business; and so
essential are these requisites that none of them, taken singly, is suffi-
cient without the rest. Those expedients cannot be found in an in-
strumentality so divided in itself, so encumbered, so costly, so
fraught with dangers, moral as well as pecuniary, as the instru-
mentality of contests on adverse possession in a Supreme Court.
As, however, the first responsible ministers of South Australia
as a Government have not seen cause to propose a measure, to make
available for the public use in this direction the public maps, public
grants, and public registers as a complete and efficient instrumen-
tality to set good titles in safety for the future—and as they have
not been able, as a Government, to think of the intelligence and
good will and integrity existing in this community, as a means to
arrive at a settling of many, if not of all, of the titles which have
become entangled through untoward complications of law or lawyers ;
our public would still have been left at the mercy of these, but for
a measure which has been privately initiated by a member of Go-
vernment, who was returned at the head of the poll for the sake of
this very measure, and which will, therefore, if only the people will
carry him through with it, be eminently the measure of the people.


(B) Mr. Torrens' Bill, its Operation, Objects, Method, and Effects.
Its Operation. —The Bill does not propose to bring existing titles
compulsorily under the new law, but it offers facilities for their being
brought under its operation, and is compulsory with respect to
transactions subsequent to the day to be fixed for its commencement,
say January Ist, 1857, and all transfers, mortgages, &c., of such
lands shall be regulated in accordance with the proposed new system.
If the promised Limitation of Actions Bill, and this present one
could be made to work harmoniously together, little doubt can exist,
but that at no very distant time the whole of the land titles in this
colony will come under the operation of one complete and useful
system.
Such desirable results would be further facilitated, if all the former
Registration Acts were at once consolidated into one with this
present one. (See page 94.)
Its object appears to be the assurance of any kind of property
in immoveables*, whether absolute + entailed, &c., or for life%
(sects. 20 and 25, &c.), or terms of years (sect. 54, and form Q.),
including also any kind of wses|j and trusts § (sect. 38).
Schedule G. is indeed drafted only to meet the case of absolute
transfers, but this is an oversight, the act itself and form F. being
clearly intended to meet any less estate as well. IT
* See definition of the word “ proprietor ” in section 111., page 2.
t See definition of the word “ fee-simple,” page 3, line 31.
% See form of memorandum of sale, schedule P.
§ See schedule J.
|| See schedule K.
11 The true division of estates according to English law is the
11. Estates less than freehold, of which there are three sorts—
Estates for years. At will. By sufferance.
It would be well to dispense with this division as it involves a
variety of exploded doctrines, but so long as it is at all alluded to
in the act it ought to be strictly adhered to.


Its Method is—lst. Registration of Ownership hy deposit of
Duplicate of land grant —(See Sections 24 and 70.) —or of Cer-
tificate of Title —or of Lease (Section 54), any of these, either
directly or in trust (Section 38), in every case of a transfer.
The term “certificate of title,” we think, had better be exchanged
for a term which is more readily understood—land grant. At least
both terms are synonymously used in the Bill, the only distinction
being that the land grant is the instrument originally issued alienating
the lands of the croAvn, while the certificate of title is intended to
designate subsequent grants of the same land (or portions of it),
issued to purchasers or other transferees after surrender of the
original grant (or endorsement on the same of the alienation in part
of the lands comprised in it). The principle is that in each transfer
of the fee simple the lands should be surrendered to the crown, and
a new grant taken from the crown forming a fresh root of title, for
which a fresh page will be opened in the register book.
This, indeed, is not sufficiently developed in the draft as it stands.
But as the principle is already well understood by the public ; it is
not to be doubted but that the necessary clauses to secure its effect
in the eye of the judges will be added in committee.
2nd. Registration of Charges, hy entry on the hook and En-
dorsement (on the grant or certificate) of every charge or encum-
brance whatsoever that may take place to affect the land. (See
section 29, and our further remarks below, subject V.)
It is also evident that in virtue of this system, by registering the
property as such under the original grant or title, the great desi-
deratum of THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE LANDS BY
MAPPING will in all cases be very readily and usefully adhered to,
and may be carried to perfection. In this respect we refer to our
concluding remarks. (See pages 87 and 95.)
Instrumentality to he employed.
To carry out this method, the Registrar-General is to keep a
Register Book, in which he must enter duplicates of all grants and
all certificates (issued after commencement of Act) and he is required
to open in the register book a separate account, a page for each grant
or certificate of title, and on this page shall record from time to time,
records of all sales, transfers, mortgages, releases, &c., affecting such
property. The history of a particular property will thus be always
ascertainable by an examination of one or more consecutive pages
of the register.
It is evident that under this method the entries can be recorded
in a uniform and precise, and very correct manner, making default
or neglect so readily traceable to its author, as to render such defaults
or neglects, which are not rare, but never punished, in private


conveyancing, a matter of very rare occurrence with the officers.
Under the Act already in force, the Registrars are liable to
treble damages and full costs of suit; this principle ought to be re-
enacted, and if necessary, extended. The books being perfectly
public, will go much further to make the responsibility in the depart-
ment, a reality, than the multifarious hidden practices of forty-four
practitioners, who are subject to no better control than the fear of
actions to be effectuated by their own fraternity in the Supreme Court
at the instance of impoverished suitors.
It may be added, that, under the new system, the jealousy of the
legal profession itself, will act as a check on the officers, and substi-
tute a healthy reaction instead of the hitherto total absence of any
effectual check in the conveyancing practice.
We must be greatly mistaken in the South Australian public, or
they will be fully able to appreciate this change in a constitutional
point of view.
Application of this Instrumentality.
To make this method available to the individual proprietor, when-
ever there is occasion for him to transfer or charge his property, the
Registrar, with the sanction of the Governor, will issue printed
forms of the various instruments needful for the contracts of sale,
transfer, mortgage, encumbrance, or release of immoveable property ;
all such documents to be marked with a particular mark or seal, the
imitation of which will be visited with a heavy punishment.*
When the official forms of instruments are properly prepared and
attested, they will then be supplied to the public at the General
Registry Office, either free of charge, or at such moderate price as
may be fixed upon.
There are some dangers to be guarded against in printed forms ;
for which, and some further particulars, we refer to page 94. We
consider next—
The Effect op Registration ; which, under this Act will be to
pass A TITLE VALID TO ALL INTENTS,
This effect cannot fail to be secured with ordinary care under any
land grant to be issued in future ; and in all other cases, arising out
of prior land grants, the Registrar-General, when desired by any
landed proprietor having lands brought under the operation of the
new law, will issue a short certificate of title, which certificate will
hold good in reference to all legal processes at least equally with the
surrendered title itself, even though no greater effect were to be
secured by the enactment.
* We may remark, however, that the penalties, as by sect. 27. of 5 Viet. 8, are much
more comprehensive and stringent than either sect. 8 or 11 of this bill, and should be
re-enacted.


But the Act proposes to do more than this.
When the fee-simple (or any freehold interest) in any lands is
sold or given up, the vendor or grantor must surrender all documents
affecting the title, each of such documents to be endorsed by the
Registrar-General, with a proper memorandum descriptive of the
occasion and time of its being surrendered.* A new grant (or certifi-
cate) will then be issued to the purchaser or grantee of the estate in
freehold, (sect. 20) In case of transmission by death, insolvency,
or marriage.—(sects. 30—33) —special provision is made for the
declaration and proof of transmission. (See form H.)
Now, it must be borne in mind that judges and legal advisers
will not be bound by the intention of this act only, however
clearly understood, but, with a view to its effect when passed,
will have regard to every other principle which they may find to
have been left in force, either in statute or common law. It will
be necessary, therefore, very clearly to see the distinction at issue
between the new and the former law. There might be a certificate
based on the surrender of the former title, such as that might
happen to be. This would in no case cut off the necessity, which
forms the greatest source of grievances under the old law, of
examining back the title; but it would still confer the benefit of
simplifying the forms materially and concentrate the search upon a
complete and identical record for the future. Or else the law may
confer on the new system the effect of assuring a title complete in
itself from the new starting point, and so on by every fresh transfer.
This is indeed what the Act aims at, and what is effected in
many other registration systems. In most of such systems it is,
nevertheless, provided that fraud, practised either upon or by the
officers, if proved, will not only be punishable, but vitiate the effect
even of the most formal transaction and record, as against the
parties directly implicated, though not against third parties.
But the merit of the system consists in its efficacy for the pre-
vention of fraud. A surrender of this sort is very unlikely to
take place before a public officer, unless the proprietor sees the
purchase-money paid or Neither is it likely that a pur-
chaser will pay his money down, unless he knows that he has the
identical party, whose name is on the book present, to effect the
surrender; and third parties cannot suffer, because under such a
system no rights are allowed, as affecting the land, except such as
appear on the book, and are endorsed, too, in their unalterable
order on the certificates. Such a system, in fact, works out its
own efficiency, if only consistently adhered to in its own principles,
which are speciality of every entry and strict priority according to
the order of entry.
We therefore refer upon this point to the principle as expressed,
* But the document is to be returned if it forms the title also for lands not under tbe
operation of the Act.


though imperfectly, in section 23 of sth Viet., No. 8, which
leaves it open ( only) to dispute either “ the execution of the in-
strument” or “the truth of the memorial (office) copy or (Registrar’s)
certificate ,” on the “ground of fraud or forgery, or of other cause of a
like nature, as for instance the insanity , imbecility , or duress of the
person whose execution of, or signature to any instrument is disputed
—and which also expressly throws the burden of proving on the
person alleging the fraud.” (See also sects. 3 and 28 of 5 Viet., 8.)
In Act No. 22 of 1853 : —“lt is provided that it shall neverthe-
less be lawful to impeach such entry by shewing that the certificate
to which the same refers has been obtained by fraud j” which ought
to be compared with section 5 in No 20 of 1853, and not to be
re-enacted without expressly prohibiting the courts from giving
effect to notices served apart from the register or against it for the
future (see section 41 of the draft). We have noticed already that
the obnoxious doctrine of notices is as yet considered as paramount,
notwithstanding its plain disavowal in Act 8 of 1841.
The measure should be very clearly and forcibly drafted upon
this and other coincident topics ; and should it still meet with oppo-
sition upon this point, the opponents should be called upon to shew
that registration, overriding notices, is calculated to do more harm
than their doctrine of private notices does when overriding public
registration.
WTiatever the result may be of the contest, it is clear that there
must be no compromise between two systems fundamentally adverse.
If the public are to have confidence in the registry at all, it must not
be allowed to be overridden in a single instance by the mere fact of
notice of an adverse claim apart from the register.
Section 33 of the draft ought also to be reconsidered.
But it has been sneeringly observed that, to arrive at a clear
starting point, there must be a general jubilee of titles first. This is
going far beyond the truth. The original holders of land grants will
have nothing to do but to apply and get certificate out for such
lands as they mean to bring under the operation of the Act, in
order to confer on any successors a continuation of the same most
simple and effective assurance. Other lands will,’at the proprietors’
desire, be gazetted here, and, according to circumstances, in London
and the neighbouring colonies, calling upon all adverse claimants to
come in within given periods (from one month to two years) and
substantiate their claims by taking proceedings to that effect in the
Supreme Court. The registrar is also to give written notice to any
who may appear in the deeds or otherwise as interested.
This gazetting, coupled with insertions in the paper, and posting
up in conspicuous places in districts, will, no doubt, create a suffi-
cient stir here in South Australia, to put everybody on the look-out
for their interests ; and as for absentee proprietors, the justice of their


case is met by additional gazettings in the metropolis and neighbour-
ing colonies —(New Zealand* included). The proposed system is,
therefore, in effect, to establish title by notice and non-claim; a
principle which is essentially English, founded in the common law,
and confirmed by the universal practice of civilised nations ; its
effect being this, (wherever it is practically adhered to) to oblige
parties, on going abroad, to authorise an agent to act for them at the
registry office —an effect which it is desirable, for reasons of public
as well as private convenience, to secure.
If it should be thought too great a stretch of power to bestow
certificates of title with absolute effect, in any case where indeed no
caveat is lodged, but outstanding claims appear on the face of the
title itself, which the proprietor is unable to prove as satisfied or
removed, the alternative would still be left to grant a provisional
certificate, subject to such outstanding claim. This remedy has been
suggested and very ably advocated in a Melbourne journal.
Upon the whole, however, the establishing of title at the applica-
tion of the owner of the deeds and lands, by public notice and
non-claim, bids fair to meet all reasonable requirements. The
remedy for adverse claimants will lie in court proceedings, the same
as before, with only this distinction, that they will be obliged at
once to bring it forward, if the possessor gets the lands gazetted.
They may consider this a hardship, on account of the unsurmount-
able obstacle of the costs of proceeding with either law or equity in
the Supreme Court, which undoubtedly are, in effect, tantamount to
an open denial of justice to parties who cannot risk these enormous
chances. It should not be so. But neither is it the fault of Mr.
Torrens’ Bill; nor of itself an objection that must needs be allowed
to stand in the way of a great public necessity.
It should be borne in mind that outstanding claims and latent
beneficial interests are generally best settled by a resort to arbitra-
tion ; and, to give both parties equal chances, no better means could
be found than to oblige both, at the instance of either, to resort to this.
Should this view meet with support, additional clauses might be
framed similar to section 14, No. 22 of 1852. May the representatives
of the people bear in mind that the principle of trial by jury is
unavailable in any case where the costs with which it is surrounded
form an impassable harried' to a party.
This will not preclude any party from employing professional
advisers, if able to remunerate them for their services.
For similar reasons it is obviously much to the purpose that the
new law is framed so as to keep registration within the limits of
official or ministerial authority entirely apart from judicial functions.
This is so strictly adhered to that the two commissioners (to be
appointed by the governor), who are to assist the registrar-general in
♦ New Zealand is not mentioned in the draft, probably by oversight.


conducting the system of notices and non-claim, are to be non-
professional men (though they may employ counsel).
Upon this point it will be objected that to decide upon contested
land titles is essentially a judicial act. We do not deny it, but we
beg to point out that to authenticate the act of the parties is not
necessarily a judicial act, but is’ much more properly conducted
through a simple official instrumentality, taking the agreements of
the parties for its basis. Neither of the two branches ought to
clash with the other ; they work together now, in the case of regis-
tration of a judgment or will; they ought to do the same in any
other case where the decision of a court is really required. But we
maintain that, for the authentication of transfers by consent, no
court decision is requisite, and that the only cases where it can be
requisite are contested claims and transmissions, and that perfect
justice is secured, in the first class of cases, by the option left to
parties to go to court, either with or without arbitration (which of
itself is of a judicial nature), and by the declarations prescribed (in
section 30, form H) in cases of transmission by will, descent, mar-
riage, or insolvency.
In those countries which have the misfortune to be under despotic
government, the machinery of judicial registration is resorted to;
but all the other communities and nations, the Hansetowns, Bel-
gium, Holland, the British colonies in America, and the United
States have taken special care to keep their systems of registration on the
official or ministerial side. In none of these communities will the
people allow the judge a decision as to whether their agreement is fit
to be registered or not; all they want is, a registrar competent
and responsible to record the transactions with correctness, and
dispatch. A clear starting point must, of course, first be gained ;
but this is always obtainable under any reasonable system of notices
and non-claim, and by reference or court decision, if demanded.
The ministerial system of registration is, therefore, the only one
suited to the requirements of free and industrious communities.
As we feel assured that our South Australian public will fully coin-
cide with this view, it only remains for us to examine, whether the
proposed plan is calculated to extend the benefit of correct and ex-
peditious registration to all the branches of transactions in land, that
are likely to arise amongst us.
Application of its Effects to the several Branches of Business in Land.
The sound and perfect principle of passing the estate, by publicly
registering the consent of the parties, (and not by the act of only
privately executing) is expressed both positively and negatively, and
applied to any kinds of interest, promiscously, in the draft bill.
1. Positively, sect. 29, enacts that, the registrar’s certificate of title


shall constitute the title of such purchaser, or of such proprietor, as
the case may be, to the land therein specified, valid to all intents,
which clearly sets forth the intention of the new law, to make the
title by the registrar’s certificate, both final and conclusive —and
this, whether or not the transfer was for or upon a valuable con-
sideration (very different from section 3 of 5 Yict., 8).
2, Negatively; a clause is expressly framed so as to deny the
final and conclusive effect as a means to affect the land, to any in-
strument, of whatever solemnity, form, or purport. This is to be
found (somewhat late in the vineyard) in Section 68 :—“ No instru-
ment shall be effectual to pass the 'property in any lands under the
operation of this act, or to render such lands liable as security for the
payment of money, until the Registrar-General shall have entered
the particulars thereof in the book of registry, and made endorse-
ment thereof as hereinbefore directed to be made in each case re-
spectively ; and should two or more instruments executed by the
same proprietor, and purporting to transfer or encumber the same
estate or interest in any land, be at the same time presented to the
Registrar-General for registration and endorsement, he shall register
and endorse that instrument under which the person claims pro-
perty, who shall present to him the grant or certificate of title of such
lands for that purpose .”
Freehold Estates, (A) Fee Simple.
1, Original Land Grants. Public Maps.
The application of this maxim to land grants, as a matter of
fact, or practice a least, has already been decided upon in the Legis-
ture, by the Act No. 23. of 1855-6. No property, of course, can
be registered as vested in the subject, unless it is first created. This
is done by land grant, which, in itself is an official Act of Her Ma-
jesty’s Representative under the public seal of the province; but,
under the Act we have cited, the owner or his heir cannot avail
himself of it without first of all depositing its duplicate in the
Registry Office, this, and pre-payment of the fees for this being now
compulsory on all by that Act,
Y This is alluded to in sect. 20 of the new bill, and again incidentally
mentioned, sect. 24, but in neither case sufficiently clear without
reference to the former act, which ought to be consolidated with the
present one, so as, expressly, to preserve the principle of compulsory
deposition of duplicate of every future land grant.
To make registration in South Australia as beneficial as complete-
ness can make it, some means to get duplicates deposited of all
prior land grants, too, might be devised; or at least there should be
a duplicate list of all the original grantees from the beginning, made
out so as to be of conclusive authority, and deposited in the Registry
Office.


Then also the public maps should be made more extensively the
means of identifying even subdivisions correctly.
We cannot forbear upon this most important branch of the subject,
at least to offer a few most pertinent remarks, which practical ex-
perience in the colony has confirmed.
It must be admitted that the iise, in many instances, of private
maps in modern conveyances has tended to lessen the chances of
future obscurity as to parcels ; but the formation of a map, with
due precautions for accuracy, involves considerable delay as well as
expense in completing a purchase ; and as the advantages of it are
prospective and often overlooked by persons not familiar with the
subject, there is great temptation to dispense with it. In the case
of a small property too, a private map, which is confined of course
to the land intended to be conveyed, frequently does not shew its
position to any permanent objects, and after the removal of fences,
alteration of watercourses, &c., &c., upon its incorporation with an
adjoining estate, the evidence of identity which such a map affords
would fail.
If a system of map indexes were resorted to, it would be highly
convenient to provide for the proper examination of maps received
under the Act No. 22 of 1853.
We shall recur to this subject at the conclusion.
(2) Estates of Inheritance derived from prior Land Grants.
3. As to titles derived from prior land grants, we have already
cited sect. 29. We may here add the following very important
proviso : —“ 67. No vendor of any land shall have any equitable
lieu thereon by reason of the non-payment of the purchase money,
or any part of the purchase money, for the same. t ” ,If the purchase
money be credited whole, or in part, the vendor may secure his in-
terest very readily under this act, by a certificate of mortgage.
There are no particular provisions for the registration of entailed
estates. The covenants to be implied are mentioned. (See No. 15
of 1843).
(£>') Estates not of Inheritance for life, dec.
3, These are as yet only incidentally mentioned in form F.
Leases.
4. Land under the operation of this Act will be leased upon the
same rational principle as any other interest in land, by registering
the duplicate of the memorandum of lease (Q.), to be produced
together with the grant of certificate of title, and be endorsed thereon
by the registrar. On this subject section 55 has the noticeable words—•
“ Clause 55. Every lease or assignment, when so recorded in the
register book, shall be held to transfer to the lessee an estate in such


land as tenant, subject, nevertheless, to all such conditions and
covenants as may be expressly set forth in such lease, if any, and to
the conditions and covenants which are hereinafter declared to be
implied against a lessee, or to all or any of such last-mentioned
covenants as shall not be negatived or modified by express declaration
in such lease or endorsed thereon.”
It will be seen at once how much this feature of the new law
of setting forth the covenants to be implied, will abbreviate the
writings in the case of leases as well as mortgages or sales, and even
trusts.
With regard to leases, however, some covenants might still be
added. A perusal of the draft deed published by a conveyancer in
the Register (Oct. 24, part 1., and Nov. 22, 1856, part II.) may be
very usefully consulted ; also Act No. 15 of 1843.
We find no section providing for the cancelling of leases in the
same way, as also no provisions for the numerous class of leases with
right of pre-emption or purchase. This subject was also largely
treated in the pages just mentioned.
Mortgages.
5. The bill proposes an entirely new method of securing mortgages.
A bill of mortgage is to be issued according to a set form (I ) the
duplicate of which is to be recorded in the register-book, upon being
produced together with the proprietor’s grant, certificate of title,
lease, or other instrument, as the case may be ; both the bill of
mortgage, and entry on the book containing every particular neces-
sary for the perfect security of the mortgagee, especially the date of
instrument, registration, name, and residences of the parties, amount
of principal-money, and rate of interest, dates for its payment, and
date for redemption. This being done, the same particulars are to
be endorsed on the proprietor’s grant or lease, &c., together with a
memorandum stating the day and hour on which the particulars of
mortgage had been recorded in the register-book. The same
memorandum is to be endorsed on the bill of mortgage. The draft
of the new law does not say—although, according to sect. 35, it
evidently intended that the proprietor’s documents so endorsed, are
to be returned to him; the mortgagee being secured to all intents and
purposes in the possession of his endorsed bill of mortgage, which
is transferable (by record and by endorsement, the same as the first
transaction) and the effect of which is thus set forth, sect. 35 :
Every bill of mortgage when so executed, and recorded in the
register book as aforesaid, shall be held to transfer to the mortgagee
the legal estate of the mortgagor in such land, as set forth in such
bill of mortgage, subject, nevertheless, to redemption by such mort-
gagor, on payment of the principal sum and interest specified in


such bill of mortgage, at the dates therein specified, and in accord-
ance with the provisions hereinfater contained.
It will be seen from this that, under the new law, the mortgagee
retains the same position as before, the legal estate being vested in
him by the record, the same as hitherto by the deed of mortgage.
In the plan of the Bill, as published in the South Australian Register
last year, this was otherwise, a particular feature in the law, as then
proposed, being this, that the mortgagee was not deemed to be the
owner of the lands, which were to be secured to him merely so far
as is needful for the safety of his claim.
The Treasurer in his address on the first reading of the Bill informs
us, that, in consenting to this change, he yielded his own convictions
in deference to the opinion of others. It is to be regretted that the
Treasurer, with less than his usual firmness and sagacity, appears to
have yielded in this respect to the apprehensions which in that state of
things which has hitherto prevailed, are the unavoidable consequence
of the barbarous conveyancing principles under which a creditor
could not be secured in lands, but by vesting the debtor’s
estate in him. Any one who has ever lived under a better system
will testify that these fears are without foundation, so soon as there
is a consistent system of registration established. Even under the
new bill, as it stands, fixing the priority strictly and exclusively in
the order of registration, and effectually prohibiting any attempt at
tacking : it is to be hoped that experience will soon convince even
the most scrupulous. According to the nature of the subject, it is in
the interest of the money-lending part of the public, quite as much
as it is obviously the landowner’s right, to demand, that a theory
should prevail which would cut off any excuse by tacking to disturb
the security among creditors, or by the finesse of the feudal doctrines
of estates to deprive the owner of that which is his perfect natural
right, to obtain the use of as much capital as the surplus value
of his lands over the existing charges would justify him to apply for.
According to section 65, a mortgagee shall not, in any case, be
entitled to foreclose the equity of redemption; and, according to
section 66, no land shall be charged or affected by way of equitable
mortgage, or otherwise, by reason of any deposit of title deeds rela-
ting thereto, whether or not such deposit shall be accompanied by a
written memorandum of the intent with which the same shall have
been made.
This will not be regretted by the commercial world, much less by
the land-holders themselves, considering the increased facility for
securing capital by a legal mortgage.
Should, however, for certain cases, still greater facilities be
thought to be desirable, they may be found in the following hint,
which we take from a letter of Mr Butt, Q.C., in the public papers,
and which is evidently framed after the practice of prenotations


known in colonial systems of registration, as well as on the conti-
nent of Europe—namely, to make provision that, “to each person
recording himself as owner, an exemplification of the entry should be
given—that no further transfer should be effected without the pro-
duction of this, or accounting for its loss, and that the deposit of
this should have the same effect in equity as the deposit of title
deeds. If this latter provision were adopted, the owner of any
registered estate could, at any moment, by deposit of this document,
obtain a loan of money with as little trouble and expense as he
could now upon a deposit of railway shares or a transfer of stock.
In this suggestion the great principle of publicity, setting all
whom it may concern on their guard, is adhered to, and reconciled
with the utmost dispatch by the very important advantage, under
the new system, of having only one title deed to deposit, viz., the
certificate of the caveat or prenotation from the register book, which
would result from the plan of employing only one authentic record,
instead of multifarious private writings, for the passing and effectu-
ating estates and charges on the land.
According to Mr. Torrens’ plan the strict precedence of claims,
by priority of registry, will not be allowed to be disturbed by the
doctrines either of notices (sects. 40 and 41) or of acts of bankruptcy
(so obnoxious to traders in England, sect 43). But to render these
precautions efficient especial reference to the new Insolvency Act
should be made, and it would perhaps be a necessary remark that no
court, whether at law or equity either, should have power to admit of
evidence against the register as affecting land, except in the way we
have mentioned above. We offer this suggestion according to the
opinions of eminent counsel, contained in the volume of evidence
taken before the British parliamentary committee. So long as
duplicity in the judicature exists it will be necessary for the legisla-
ture to be jealous in any point which may be encroached upon by the
judges in “ equity.”
Upon a receipt of money secured in the mortgage, duly signed and
attested, an entry shall be made on the registry book which shall
revest the legal estate in the mortgagor, and which the registrar shall
also endorse on the grant, certificate of title, or lease, cancelling the
bill of mortgage. (Section 37.)
Upon default in payment of principal or interest for three months
from the appointed day demand may be made in writing, and after
farther default of three months the mortgagee has the option to sell,
either privately or publicly, and to effect the transfer at the registry
book. (Section 36.)
In reference to the transfer of a mortgage the bill also contains
the necessary rules and forms ( L ).
A very important branch of this subject still remains to be


discussed and upon which very opposite views may be expected to
be advanced —the subject of
Uses and Trusts.
Without pretending to an exhaustive enumeration, we may men-
tion the following classes, which will exemplify their frequency and
the probable complexity of the deeds connected with them :
I. Conveyance to trustees, for the purposes of immediate or’ulti-
mate sale where the trusts of the money are declared by other deeds
ex. gr. for the purpose of—
1. A marriage or family settlement.
2. Discharging debts specified in a separate deed.
3. Laying out the money in the purchase of other land (to be
settled to the uses of a contemporaneous or previous settlement.
4. Immediate or speedy division among specified objects,
11. Conveyances to trustees for purposes other than that of imme-
diate or speedy sale, viz.—for the purposes of unincorporated part-
nerships or imperfect corporations ex. gr. (besides ordinary part-
nerships) mining, building and improvement, annuity, investment
societies or other small companies.
As there is a tendency in the present state of society to increase
both the number and complexity of these arrangements, they are a
great and growing cause of the length of abstracts and the com-
plexity of titles.
Mr. Torrens proposes to deal with these classes of interests under
the somewhat ominous name of Encumbrances (sections 38 to 42)
in two manner of forms—the one (schedule J) called a “ Bill of
Encumbrance ; the other (schedule K) a “ Bill of Trust.”
The “ Bill of Encumbrance ’
Is intended to charge lands in a direct manner, thus, “ for the
purpose of securing to and for the use and benefit of C. D. * *
I do set over and appoint all my estate in the said land to be en-
cumbered to the extent, and liable for the payment of, the above
specified sums, in manner and subject to the conditions, restrictions,
and contingencies, reversions and remainders above specified.
The “Bill of Trust ”
Is intended to “ invest all my (the donor’s) estate and interest in
the land, &c., in trust for the uses and benefit of C. D.,” and there-
fore purporting to “ transfer, set over, and appoint all my estate and
interest, &c. (or so much of my estate, &c., as is above specified and
limited) to E. F. and G. H. as trustees, to have and to hold the said
estate and interest in trust for the uses and benefit of the said C. D.,
subject to the conditions, limitations, restrictions, and contingencies,
reversions and remainders, above set forth.”


Both forms are proposed to be recorded in the following manner :
The encumbering proprietor’s grant, certificate of title, lease, &c.,
&c., is to be produced at the Registry office, together with the “ Bill
of encumbrance” or “trust,” in order to have their particulars en-
dorsed on the former, and recorded also (no doubt by duplicate,
although this is not expressed) in the register book (section 38) in
the order as they come in (section 40), and the encumbrancees or
trustees, the same as mortgagees, shall, “notwithstanding any ex-
press, implied, or constructive notice, be entitled in priority one
over the other, according to the date at which each instrument is
recorded in the register books, and not according "to the date of each
instrument itself” (section 41).
As for the effect of this—
It is lastly proposed to enact, that in any case of a transfer to
any person or body in this way, to the use of, or in trust for any other
person, “ the ivhole legal ownership of the transferred estate or interest
shall vest in the person or body corporate to whom, the same shall
be so immediately and directly transferred; subject, however, to a
trust for the benefit of such other person. Every limitation which,
before the passing of this Act might have been made by way of
shifting, springing or executory use, may hereafter be made by
transfer, in manner hereinbefore provided, without the intervention of
uses.”
Thus far the draft bill. If on a subject of such intricacy the
public may attempt to form an opinion ; it is likely to be that the
conditions of sufficient notoriety, cannot be, or at least are not in the
bill, as it stands, sufficiently guarded in the case of prospective
events, such as are usually in view in conveyances to uses. We are
apprehensive that whenever such events actually happen, the parties
benefited by the same ought to register too ; or else, (if without
this they are allowed to take and to deal with their interests) that
the objects of registration will be greatly evaded and frustrated.
There are no provisions in the draft to meet these and similar diffi-
culties in this part of the scheme.
A “ Conveyancer,” too, has lifted a warning voice in the South
Australian Register, by stating' a case, which it will
be well for our legislature to study.
Dangers of Conveying to Uses.
On the first reading of the bill, the hon. and learned the Attorney-
General gave his opinion that the measure, though calculated to work
well in regard to the legal estate, couM not be applied with equal
success to “ uses,” and which he thought were likely to be exten-
sively resorted to in this colony. Although the act lias it that limi-
tations hitherto affected by way of shifting use, &c., may hereafter
be made without the intervention of uses ; it is not provided that


they shall not be made any more in the same manner as hitherto.
Other members expressed themselves averse to the practice of
conveying, in toto, to uses ; and indeed very justly so, fob we
FIND IT EXPBESSLY STATED BY BIaCKSTONE, THAT —The Only
s&'vice to which this statute of uses is now consigned, is in
giving efficacy to certain new and secret species of conveyances ;
introduced in order to render transactions of this sort as private as
possible, and to save the trouble of making livery of seizin ; the only
ancient conveyance of corporeal freehold ; the security and notoriety
of which public investiture abundantly overpaid the labour of it.”
Effects of Trust on Land.
However this may be, it is plain, though uses were abolished
and prohibited, that transfers simply made to teustees cannot be
dispensed with in the present state of society. Then the question
immediately arises, whether or not a purchaser shall be bound to
look to the due application of the proceeds arising in the hands of
the registered trustees under a declaration of trust, either directly
referred to, and perhaps inscribed at length, or at least implied in
the registered instrument of a bill of trust I —-
If all the deeds connected with these arrangements were brought
on the register, it is clear that in many cases registered titles would
become most voluminous and embarrassing.
It is equally certain that most generally the parties conveying to
trustees do not wish for such a protection. Hence the clauses stu-
diously framed in trust deeds to relieve purchasers from the necessity
of looking to the fulfilment of the trust conditions, marriages, births,
deaths, &c., &c., &c.
In modern practice general experience has shown that the incon-
venience, delay, and expense occasioned to parties interested under
trusts, by the rules of equity, which make the trust a burden on the
land, far outweigh the benefit of a protection against the occasional
deviation of the trustees in those cases where the operation of the
rule is excluded.
The efforts of conveyancers in this respect frequently fail, from the
extreme difficulty, in some cases, of excluding the doctrine of equity
as to constructive notice.
It must be anticipated that many of these deeds will not be regis-
tered ; that reference will be made in the “bills of trust” brought
on the register to the declarations of trusts which remain unre-
gistered. Some clear rule, therefore, must be established with refer-
ence to such a case.
Remedy.
We think that the rule should be, that a third party is not to be
affected by a reference in a registered deed to any declaration of the


trusts, although the terms of the reference may express or imply the
existence of a trust. This rule, we believe, will be in accordance
with the interests of those who are concerned in their due execution,
and with the wishes of the purchasers.
This rule is also already recognized by the legislature in previous acts.
Under this rule the creator of a trust, by putting the necessary
details upon the register, may, if he think fit, bind the purchaser to
see to the execution of a trust in all or in any particulars. But the
creator of a trust will not be obliged to do so. He is the best
judge, and would desire to be allowed to judge, in each case, whether
the increased security obtained by obliging a purchaser to see to the
due execution of the trust, and to become, as it were, a trustee, is
or is not dearly purchased by the expenses which we have seen to be
incident to this security.
But we think, nevertheless (2) that it would be highly advisable,
and necessary, indeed, that duplicates of all declarations of trusts
should be deposited, to enable the parties intended to be benefited to
guard their interests in case of necessity by placing a caveat on the
register.
The interests of all who purchase or make investments, or that
have to work with capital secured on land, and of the numerous
classes that are represented through agents, including minors and
wives and widows—various and variegated and often diverging, as
all these interests are—would be best consulted by admitting of
direct plain transfers, or money charges, only, to be made
valid and legal by means of complete and constant registra-
tion of all dealings in the same generally. There should be two
ways only for effecting transfers of land on the book, viz., either
directly to the party to he benefited, or else to trustees only, without any
intervention of “ uses” (and this so as to exonerate any third person
by law from looking to the application of the trust effects, but
totally to take away the power of conveying to uses). There can be
no good reason to compel such parties as are content with a personal
security when confiding to trustees, to burden the land, a species of
security they do not seek for. On the other hand it cannot be con-
sistent to allow any person in whose name the lands are entered on
the public book to deal with the same otherwise than publicly, so as
to create estates in the land which will not become known on the
book.
Should these views be found to be correct, simplicity and effi-
ciency of registry will be secured, and the interests of all parties
consulted according to their own desire.
General Observations.
To provide for the cases in which it may be desired to make refer-
ence in registered deeds to deeds executed before the commencement


of the register, we propose that permission should be given to
deposit these latter deeds, or authenticated copies of them, in a
separate department of the registry office, by re-enacting the useful
parts of the former Acts.
But this alone would by no means be enough. It will be highly
necessary indeed so to consolidate them as to leave only one
ALTERNATIVE; for if some expedient in this direction is not
adopted, we shall henceforth have the continuance of at least five difierent
methods for charging or passing landed estates, to wit : —
1. To create some legal estates by an unregistered deed (the law,
as it stands, leaving it quite optional with any party to register or
not).
2. To make some registered or unregistered trusts a burden on
the land in “ equity.”
2. To get precedence for a deed, or will, or judgment (which also
affects the land, under section 184 of the Supreme Court Act of 1858),
by registering under any of the Acts passed from 1841 to 1853.
This method would be subdivided as follows :
(а) By memorial;
(б) By memorial and enrolment;
(c) By deposit of duplicate ;
At the option of the parties and their advisers.
4. To take advantage of some “ notice ” expressly served, or
implied, or conjured up by “ construction in equity.”
5. To pass, charge, or encumber lands under the operation of this
new Act.
If parties can or will not avail themselves of the new Act, they
should be obliged at least to register by deposit of duplicate only ;
and such registration should be made compulsory on all.
Personal Attendances. Agency.
In conclusion it will be most proper to quote the passage which
will enable our colonists to deal personally or through proxies of
their own choosing before the registrar.
“ The execution of any instrument, or the discharge of any mort-
gage or encumbrance, may be proved by the parties, if within thirty
miles from the general registry office, then before the registrar ; if at
a greater distance , then before a notary public ; (if in Great Britain,
the same, or before mayors or chief officers of corporations; if in a
British possession, before a judge, governor, or chief secretary ; any
where else before the British consular officer.)”
According to section 15 of 5 Viet., 8, the identity of witnesses or
parties proving a certificate of this mortgage before a registrar must
be either known to him or proved by oath or affirmation before him.
This is a sound principle and should be re-enacted.
A provision will be necessary also to render effectual the concurrence


of married women to any of the forms adopted, upon a basis similar
to (but not the same in all details) as N 0.15 of 1845.
The Americans, at least, appear to place the same confidence in
any magistrate, of which, in our “ Ordinances,” only judges and
masters of a supreme court are considered as worthy depositaries.
A bar to dower ought also to be added.
We can only briefly notice that a special clause (sect. 71,) pro-
vides for cases of infancy or other incapacity, and that a series of
clauses is introduced, to enable the owners of land to warrant the
sale or mortgaging of their lands through agents, under certain regu-
lations. The object of these clauses (sects. 47 to 53) will be readily
perceived, if the reader takes an interest in studying them.
According to Ordinance 6 of 1845, “whosoever shall, for or in
expectation of any gain, fee, or reward, directly or indirectly draw
or prepare any conveyance, lease, or other deed relating to any real
or personal estate, without being so admitted and enrolled (as a
barrister, solicitor, attorney, or proctor in the supreme court), shall
for every such offence forfeit and pay the sum of £50.”
There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the profession from enforcing
this against any one that would fill up a printed form.
We protest, however, in the name of common sense and all that
proper and just, against the infliction of “ notary public,” if nothing
else is meant thereby but the portly conduct of any gentleman, whom
(as the law stands now, only let the people hear and be astonished)
the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY may appoint under that
specious name of a notary public for a fee of <£so ! There can be
little doubt but that under such appointments the grievances of
monopoly paraded in the Court of Arches at Canterbury would be
revived in Adelaide with a vengeance.
The South Australian colonists want a responsible agency, such as
would be regulated by government or the chamber of commerce.
With a view to their duties it should be borne in mind, at least, what
the views of honest commercial people are on such subjects. A
monopoly of the legal profession in these things is altogether un-
called for, if only the people will take that ordinary care which is
necessary to maintain plain dealings and plain official records of
the same.
Having thus far shewn that, as colonists, we have every reason to
adopt the measure proposed by one, who has been with the colony
from the beginning, and whose name is connected with the history
of its foundation, we may sum up by observing with the British
parliamentary committee on conveyancing—that the ancient system
of livery of seizin, attornments, and fines levied with proclama-
tions was complete and reasonable, so long as it was an effectual
means of securing notoriety, but that it became barbarous and falla-


cious when it became the practice to call that notoriety and notice
which in fact was a mere pretence of either—and that, therefore, by
adopting complete and efficient registration—which Mr Torrens’
measure has every chance to establish amongst us, we are only re-
viving with much greater success, the true English principle, adapted
to the circumstances of our age.
BlacJcstone affirms that the frauds which have arisen since the
exchange of those public and notorious conveyances for mere private
and secret bargains, have well evinced the wisdom of our ancient law.
Any man in fact can see, that it was their love of publicity and of
straightforward actions, and their jealous care for the public prin-
ciples, of which the law is the guardian, which made our ancestors
support those forms.
CONCLUSION.
Encouragement from the State of the Question in Britain.
We cannot conclude without calling on the reformers of the
property law in South Australia to take encouragement from the
fact that the means of effecting the much desired object, which
have approved themselves to the practised intellect of experienced
lawyers in England, are very similar, in their general outline, to the
plan for the accomplishment of the same purpose which has here
been suggested by Mr. Torrens.
An eminent barrister, Mr. Butt, Q.C., lately addressed a letter to
the Solicitor-General, Sir Richard Bethel, on the means of facilitating
the transfer of real property. Some idea of the very important
suggestions contained in Mr. Butt’s letter, may be gathered from the
extracts which have been republished in the Register (April 14).
We will here only quote the following :
First, I propose the establishment of a great public record of the ownership of landed
estates, the appearance upon which of the name of any person as the owner of an estate
should be conclusive evidence, for all purposes, that he is so.
The recourse to such a record should be perfectly optional with each individual owner.
It might be adopted either for the purpose of quieting his own title, or of an assurance
to a purchaser from him.
In the case of compulsory sales of property at the instance of creditors, any person
interested in the sale might compel a resort to this mode of assurance.
It should, however, be equally applicable to all transfers of property, whether judicial
sales or private ones.
In the instance of all devolutions of property, whether by descent or devise, the tribunal
controlling the record should have power to enter the name of the successor.
The record of the ownership of any estate should be accompanied by a map defining
it upon a scale large enough to admit of easy and distinct reference to each parcel.
Unless a new Court of Wills be instituted, all wills affecting any estate on the record
should be entered in a separate book, and referred to by figures of reference from the
record of ownership.
Assurances settling any of these estates might be made by a public act to bo entered in
the record, and preserved to guide and direct the future entries of the names of owners.
With respect to encumbrances, if deemed desirable, a book might be kept, by an entry
in which any estate already on record might be charged with a sum of money by a process
as simple as that by which the ownership could be transferred. If it were deemed under-
sirable so to faciliate encumbrances, provision ought to be made, and to each person
recording himself as owner, an explanation of the entry, under the seal of the Court,
should be given—that no further transfer should be effected without the production of


this or accounting for its loss, and that the deposit of this should have the same effect in
equity as the deposit of title-deeds.
If this latter provision were adopted, the owner of any registered estate could, at any
moment, by deposit of this document, obtain a loan of money with as little trouble and
expense as he could now upon a deposit of railway shares or a transfer of stock.
This would, in effect, place the loan money on estates in Ireland very much on the same
footing as a similar loan now stands in England in the counties in which there is no
register. The deposit of title-deeds would constitute the safe security for the lender, but
with this very important advantage, that, under the proposed system, the only title-deed
would be the exemplification of the entry on the roll of the Court.
The success which is destined to crown the efforts of such re-
formers is very significantly shadowed forth by that masterly per-
formance, the New Shipping Act, through which property in British
shipping, whether employed at home or in navigating the most
remote seas, may be dealt with so safely and accurately under every
imaginable contingency, that human ingenuity can scarcely anticipate
circumstances which are not provided for; and the able conductor of
our leading journal in South Australia has very justly declared his
thorough conviction that landed property may be dealt with in a
similar way, especially in this colony.
The limits we have prescribed for ourselves preclude the possibility
of quoting with effect from the Shipping Act referred to; and we can,
therefore, only recommend it as a study to those who are deeply
convinced of the necessity of a thorough reform in our system of
conveyancing, and desirous of becoming acquainted with the lucid
and comprehensive enactments, intelligent forms, and masterly
provisions which now control every legal operation affecting the
mercantile navy of the United Kingdom.
The judicious forms comprised in the British Shipping Act are
not only capable of much useful adaptation, but highly suggestive of
arrangements.
Our original surveys are comparatively recent, and if occasional
inaccuracies may be detected, there is scope and verge enough to
admit of correction and compensatory arrangement, if the work be
commenced promptly, and conducted with the requisite skill, perse-
verance, and impartiality. The labours of the surveyor and of the
draughtsman must be rendered permanent and diffusive through the
contemporaneous efforts of the engraver or lithographer. By such a
combination and extensive art-production, every proprietor in every
district might have an authentic map of the Hundred in which he
resides ; and if he wished another copy to put aside with his title
deeds, a subsidiary artist might indicate thereon the exact position
of his property, and add a marginal sketch of the same upon a
larger scale, and with sufficient accuracy to prevent mistakes or
wilful perversion of boundaries. By these and other similar arrange-
ments and plain definitions, wrongs and uncertainties would be of
rare occurrence, and the terms “ poor man’s land,” and “no man’s
land,” would no longer be applicable to ruined homesteads or
neglected acres.
