conspicuous patch of the same colour; a lunate band of deep black
also separates the cobalt-blue of the throat from the verditer-blue
of the under surface ; tail-feathers dull green, each slightly tipped
with greyish white ; wings brown, each feather tinged with greyish-
green on its outer web ; under surface of the shoulder buff; bill and

Itemark. —This very beautiful bird is closely allied to Malurus
melanotus and M. splendens ; but on comparison the distinctive
characters of each become very apparent.
For this new species and many other fine objects I am indebted
to Mr. S. White, of Adelaide, South Australia, who procured them
in the interior of that country.
