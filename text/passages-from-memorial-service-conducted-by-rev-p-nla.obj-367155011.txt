pOR th ose we love within the veil.
Who once were comrades of our way,
We thank Th ee, Lord; for they have won
To cloudless day;
life for them is life indeed,
The splendid goal of earth’s strait race
And where no shadows intervene
They see Thy face.
o FULLER, sweeter is that life,
And larger, ampler is the air :
Eye cannot see nor heart conceive
The glory there;
]\JOR know to what high purpose Thou
Dost yet emjploy their ripened powers,
Nor how at Thy behest they touch
This life of ours.
THERE are no tears within their eyes;
With love they keep perpetual tryst;
And praise and work and rest are one,
With Thee, O Christ.

E ARLY
in the week the whole community was saddened by a
tragedy which happened over the fields of Belgium, and this
morning we meet to remember two young lives that perished in
that tragedy. From the suffering of the present let us for a
moment turn our minds back to another tragedy enacted three
thousand years ago on the hills of Gilboa, which has given us
a beautiful Hebrew lyric in which we read of two devoted lives
that perished there as "they were lovely and pleasant in their
lives. And in death they were not divided.” (2 Samuel 1., 23.)
Let us also take to our hearts the triumphant words of the greatest
of Apostles, "We are supreme conquerors through Him who
loved us.” (Romans VIII., 37.)
Only a few months ago Hugh Mcllrath left these shores on
an errand of love at the urgent request of his beloved sister,
Katherine, to bring her back to her Australian home after she
had completed her schooling in England and in France. The
days were being eagerly numbered in their home by those who
were awaiting their return. Preparations for such a gladsome event
as their home-coming were being made, when, like a bolt from
the blue, the blow fell with shattering force upon that home.
Never were brother and sister bound together by a more
tender or stronger love. United in life by the deepest devotion,
brother and sister were also united in death.
To-day we recall with profound sorrow, but also with
gratitude, these two young, beautiful, and promising lives snatched
from us by sudden calamity. Even in this deep tragedy we sorrow
not as those who have no hope. We sorrow indeed, as human
hearts must sorrow, but we sorrow also as those who believe that
we can trust ourselves and our loved ones to the Eternal Love


here and beyond the veil that at present hides them from our
physical vision. We sorrow as those who are persuaded that these
two precious and winsome young lives were not given in vain,
and that in their passing from us they cannot be lost in the mists
of death. They have outsoared the shadow of our night, but
they have not outsoared the orbit of the Divine Love.
Only those who love can know either God or their fellow-
men. Only true lovers can see into life’s deepest things and
perceive the armies of God ranged on their behalf where others
can see only blank despair. Only loving hearts can penetrate
beyond the mystery of death and discover that their beloved dead
come to them transfigured in new glories and in sustaining
memories. Such can hold that "God hath given to Love to keep
its own eternally.” In God we find our loved ones again. That
Divine Love which does all that Love can do for us here will
surely continue to do all that Love can do for our loved ones
in the LJnseen.
As a worshipping Christian people, who share like joys and
sorrows, we take this opportunity of expressing the sincere and
full sympathy of our hearts with the sorely stricken parents, with
the little sister, Helen, and with those near in kin and in love to
the departed. We assure them that our affectionate thoughts are
with them, and also our prayers that they may be strengthened
to bear their sore trial and enabled to pass through the present
darkness into the greater light of God. In this dark hour, when
God’ s waves and billows have gone over their souls, we would
renew our own confidence and seek to strengthen their confidence
in the unfailing power of Love and in the supremacy of Goodness
in our human lives. We would not seek to minimise their loss or
pronounce their burden light. We would not offer them the
commonplace that loss is common to the race or that suffering is
the lot of mortal kind.


"That loss is common would not make
My own less bitter; rather more;
Too common. Never morning wore
To evening, but some heart did break."
But we would commend the bereaved with their heavy burden
of grief to the God who cares supremely for the things which are
of supreme worth to us.
In some aspects life will mean less for them for the future
because of the empty places, but in other aspects life, through this
awful testing of sorrow and the clarifying action of a noble grief,
will mean henceforth something greater by anchoring them in the
Love that cannot die. For them in their bereavement we pray:—
"My Father! Heavenly Father! to whom sole
I lift my eye in trouble or in joy . . .
Grant in the years to come I still may prove
Obedient to the imperial voice within,
Voice of that soul which Thou hast given, which bids
Still to go forward, resting not till death.
Oh! make me strong, that so when sorrows come.
When loved ones die and leave me, and the day grows
Dark about me, and the sunshine comes
To the heart no more, and the spirit’s life seems gone,
With the love that fed us I may still march on,
Content to do Thy work and heed no more.”
Death and sorrow are as old as the human story, but so
also are the courage and faith and hope and endurance of human
hearts, which are never nobler than when confronted by grief.
The human heart has been saddened and afflicted by death, but
has not been overpowered or driven to surrender its fairest hopes.
While men believe in a worthy God, a veritable Father co-opera-
ting with them in all their strivings, and suffering with them in


all their sufferings, they can never confess defeat. While men
gladly contemplate Jesus’ conquest over the world they will even
in the face of death and change utter their challenge, "We are
supreme conquerors through Him who loved us” and who brought
life and Immortality to light in His Gospel. While men know
what love is they will never give up their beloved dead as lost.
"Our dead to us are never dead until they are forgotten,” and
Hugh and Katherine Mcllrath shall not be forgotten. How often
in our own experience the peace of God comes to our hearts
chiefly through loss or in a great sorrow. It almost seems as if
this were God’s most effective way of making light to shine upon
our path.
"God gives us love;
Something to love He lends us.
But when love has grown to ripeness,
that on which it throve
Falls off, and love is left.”
Yes, love is left.
After having contemplated the supreme glory of human life
in the divine Life of Jesus we cannot believe that we are the
mere flotsam and jetsam of a perplexing universe, or that in spite
of our transitoriness we are only such stuff as dreams are made of.
Truly "trailing clouds of glory do we come from God who is our
Home.” Yes, but rather trailing clouds of glory do we return to
the God who is our Home.
Hugh and Katherine Mcllrath were indeed lovely and
pleasant in their lives. Death cannot wrest from their sorrowing
loved ones the message and joy of the lives gone. Death cannot
rob them of the sweet memories which illuminate the present
dark hour and will come to visit and revisit their hearts with
sacramental benison. Death cannot dissipate the gentle and com-


forting influence of their fresh, young, and strong personalities.
Death cannot destroy for us the conviction that there is a scheme
of things—a divine purposeful order —though we cannot explain
its details or working, in which these brief and beautiful lives,
to us seemingly incomplete, will find a full and blessed com-
pletion in the life of God.
In the bloom of youth, blessed with many fond friendships,
radiant in the full powers of enjoyment in the present, and rich
in hopes and promise for the future, they have gone to prepare
a place for us and for their dear ones in that spiritual world, that
world of truth, which lies not on the other side of the waters
of death, but that true and abiding world of the spirit which is
here with us because it is within us, the true home of our hearts
and of the things we hold supremely worth while. This world
in which we live with our loved ones and they with us is the
world in our own hearts; it is the very life of God in our lives.
Hugh and Katherine Mcllrath were lovely in their lives and
they are lovely in our every remembrance of them.
"They shall not grow old, as we who are left grow old;
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun, and in the morning,
We will remember them.”
They speak to us from their tragic passing, and what is their
message? Surely this: How shall we be remembered when we
have passed and what are the interests that supremely matter?
Emerson mentions somewhere that when some men die thev are
not spoken of. What a tragic blotting out'
These two beautiful lives compel us to question ourselves
thus: Shall we be remembered as having enriched the lives brought


within our orbit? Have we lightened the burdens of others when
those burdens were pressing hard? Have we given ourselves and
our loves to the things that are good and true and of permanent
worth, or only to the trivialities of existence? Are we so fulfilling
our daily occupations that our work becomes sacramental and a
means of character-building? Do those who know us find life
sweeter and more meaningful just because of us? Will those
who come after us mention our names with reverence? Will they
reverently touch our work and bless us as good workmen? How
much have we helped this world with all its pain and joy nearer
to the light of God and nearer to the love of Christ?
Recently I read a striking testimony which Sir James Barrie
had written concerning a medical friend on his retirement. 'T
suppose,” wrote Barrie, "no one has ever seen him in the town
or in the glens without being able to say with confidence, 'Wher-
ever you have been this day someone has benefited by it.’ ” What
would the life of the community be if such a testimony were true
of each member?
Another challenging message coming to us through this
tragedy is the searching question: What are the things that matter
supremely to us? Only those things which neither time nor the
world nor death can snatch from us, the life of the spirit within.
Our only wealth is richness and abundance of life; it is moral
quality, not material quantity. When Jesus requested men to seek
first God’s Kingdom and God’s Righteousness, He realised that we
need the other material things and that the Father knows we
need them, but He begged men to put first things first . . . And
what are these first things in the mind of Jesus? Love and truth
and sincerity and helpfulness and kindness and obedience to the
best we each know —in a word, all that Jesus understood by men
becoming Godlike and Sons of the Father by doing the Godlike
things, by the imitation of God. These are the stuff of which


our real life consists. These are the treasures that neither moth
nor rust corrupt. These are the inexhaustible treasures which
multiply with prodigality of giving—the treasures of him that
giveth and yet increaseth. These are the treasures that we can
each bestow with liberality and in which we ourselves can be rich
while making many rich.
This, then, is the twofold challenge of these two fair young
lives to us as we here memorialise them. How shall we be remem-
bered? What are the issues of life that matter now and ever-
lastingly? Dare we remember them and be selfish and unloving?
Surely no man had a more glorious epitaph than the three Latin
words which were inscribed on Charles Kingsley’s tomb: "We
have loved. We love. We shall love.” Such unspeakably high
praise can never be ours unless we lead lives of love and service.
"Now abideth Faith, Hope, Love, these three; and the greatest
of these is Love. Pursue Love” —there is nothing higher to pursue.
"Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God. He that
loveth not knoweth not God; for God is Love. If we love one
another, God abideth in us, and His love is perfected in us.”
This is surely an ennobling and illuminating aspect of our lives
too often overlooked, that God’s love is perfected even in us
in the lowliest service to one of the least of Christ’s brothers.
In the face of death we reaffirm emphatically our faith that
"we are supreme conquerors through Him who loved us.” In
the strong love that united brother and sister in life and in death
we shall say "they were lovely and pleasant in their lives; and in
death they were not divided.”
Thus shall we remember Hugh and Katherine Mcllrath.
And to God their Father and our Father be the glory of their
lives and of opts.


fHmorial Prayrr
BY PROFESSOR ANGUS, D.D.
Eternal God, the loving heavenly Father, Thou hast been
the Refuge and Strength of men in all generations. Thou art our
Refuge and Strength to-day. Thou art the sure portion of our
hearts now and forever. Thou remainest unchangeable in Thy
boundless love and goodness to us.
In Thee, O God, we live and move and have our true being.
Our times are in Thy hand; living or dying we are the Lord’s.
Grant unto us such elevation of soul that we may find Thee in
all life and even in the presence of death. Grant that in our
daily lives we may realise increasingly that knowledge of Thee
which is eternal life in the midst of time. May we, too, have the
confidence of having within us the power of the indissoluble life.
We give Thee thanks for all the love wherewith Thou hast
enriched and enlarged our lives. We give Thee thanks for every
remembrance of our beloved dead who have gone to prepare a
place for us in Thy heavenly kingdom. May the gracious influence
and hallowed memories of their lives strengthen and comfort those
who sorrow.
O Thou who art the God of Love and Peace, the God of all
comfort, lay Thy comforting hand upon those who are bereaved.
Speak peace to their hearts even through their sorrow. While
passing through the deep waters of affliction may they realise
that they are not alone; that the Father is with them. May they
know in their hearts that love that unites them with Thee and
with their loved ones in the Unseen. Let this sorrow prove to
them a sacrament and a means to fulness of life. As they bear
their heavv cross may they have the upholding companionship of
the Master who bore His Cross.
In these days of loss may Thy light shine in the darkness
to those who sorrow; may Thy strength be vouchsafed in their
weakness. Increase within them the faith that looks through
death itself. Specially do we commend to Thy unfailing love
the sorrowing mother who cannot be present with us in this
sanctuary; replenish her mother’s loving heart with Thy love,
granting unto her the requisite patience and courage in her
suffering.
Thanking Thee for Him who brought Life and Immortality
to light, thanking Thee for victory in life and in death, we com-
mit ourselves and our blessed dead to the Love that cannot forget;
to the Love that cannot let us go. Through Jesus, our only Lord.
Amen.
