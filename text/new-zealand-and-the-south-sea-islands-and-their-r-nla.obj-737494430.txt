NEW ZEALAND AND THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS,
AND THEIR RELATION TO THE EMPIRE.
I propose first to ask you to allow me to give you a v few facts about
New Zealand and the South Sea Islands, and, subsequently, to
consider these facts in relation to the great subject of a Fede-
rated Empire. As practical men, lam sure you will agree with
me that the question of Federation must be considered on more
than general grounds. Whenever it is discussed with the idea of
deciding some immediate proposition for putting it in force, it will
have to bear the brunt of the most searching investigation in relation
to its effects on every part of the vast dominions which it concerns.
As an ardent advocate of Federation, I think I shall humbly perform
some small service to the cause if I discuss the condition of that
part of the Empire with which I am best acquainted, and point out
how the various facts to which I allude have, more or less, a bear-
ing on the great question itself. If those connected with the cen-
tral seat of the Empire would perform a like task, a step would be
made towards focussing the various interests to be served, which
would greatly aid the final determination of the exact details of
the plan to be advocated. When the day arrives for propounding
the scheme with a view to its immediate adoption, the realms of
generalisation and of sentiment, in which at present the question
too much dwells, will have to be deserted for a matter-of-fact
material and precise footing on the dominions themselves which
are the subject of the proposal.
How to reach New Zealand naturally is the first inquiry. New
Zealand, in common with some of the Australian Colonies, enjoys
this advantage: a visit to it may be made the excuse for sauntering
over almost every portion of the habitable world. The emigrant
whose one idea is to reach the land he intends to adopt may find
his best route in a direct sailing vessel. Excellent ships, excellently
found, constantly leave Great Britain for various ports in New
Zealand, and passages may be obtained at from £ls to £SO, ac-
cording to the class the emigrant desires to travel. If pleasure is


his object, or if with even business objects in view, he can afford
time and money, a wide range of selection lies open to him. He
may proceed to either Canada or the United States, and after
roaming over the Eastern States at his ease, find his way to
Chicago by one of the innumerable lines of railway that converge
on that marvellous commercial centre. From Chicago he can
proceed by way of Omaha, by railway, to the far'West. From
New York to San Francisco it takes seven days, and from London
San Francisco may be reached in nineteen days. The traveller
by this route, however, generally prefers to loiter some time on
the road. From San Francisco splendidly-appointed and powerful
steamers run to New Zealand in twenty-three days. On their way
they call at the interesting kingdom of Hawaia, or as it is often-
called, the Sandwich Islands. Hawaia is interesting from many
points of view ; one of great moment as affecting the future oj
the numerous islands of the Southern Ocean is the capacity
for governing, and for being governed under a constitutional
system, exhibited by the native race. Recently Hawaia entered
into a treaty with the United States, in virtue of which m
exchange for the admission of American goods to Hawaia tree
of duty the sugar produced in Hawaia is admitted to the United
States free of duty. This is equivalent to something like a bonus
of £ls a ton. Its effect may be recognised.. From a dull, lethargic
condition, Hawaia has sprung into an animated existence, com-
parable only with the vitality one notices when gold m quantity
is newly-discovered in a country in which it was unsuspected. What
does it matter—gold, diamonds, sugar, oil? Let any country
suddenly discover an undreamt-of source of wealth, and xt ®
inhabitants are not slow to make use of it. £ls a ton added
to the value of sugar has, in little more than one year, nearly
doubled its production, and Hawaia, under the impulse the United
States has kindly lent it, will probably become the seat of
manufacture of colossal fortunes. But we must proceed on our
vovage The route from Hawaia passes close to the Navigator or
Samoan group of islands. It would, I think, have been better for
the English Government to have taken possession of these instead
of Fiji, if the annexation of only one group was to be permitted.
It is sadly a pity to allow these islands, the best m many respects
of all Polynesia, to remain as they are—the theatre of innumerable
lawless scenes. The San Francisco steamer touches Auckland,
and then proceeds to Sydney. Coastal steamers carry the passen-
gers from Auckland to any part of New Zealand they desire to
reach.


Another and very favourite route is by a fast steamer to Mel-
bourne, round the Cape of Good Hope. The passage to Melbourne
this way has been made in forty-two days. From Melbourne there
are plenty of excellent steamers constantly leaving for various ports
in New Zealand. Those who wish to see as much as possible, and,
like Ohilde Harold,
it traverse Paynim shores and cross earth’s central line,
may visit almost every part of Southern Europe, Egypt, India,
Java, Sumatra, and Singapore en route to New Zealand by one
of the many plans which can be adopted in connection with
the route by Suez or the Canal. The passenger can embark at
Southampton, and proceeding through the Mediterranean, stopping
at Gibraltar at Malta and after passing through the Suez Canal, at Suez
and Aden, he can reach Galle in the Island of Ceylon without
change of steamer. Thence he can embark in a steamer which,
after calling at Albany in West Australia, and Glenelg in South
Australia, will land him in Melbourne. Instead of proceeding by
sea and land to Suez, he may roam through Europe, and from
Marseilles, Trieste, or Brindisi reach Alexandria. After making
himself acquainted with Egypt he may reach Suez. He can. then
travel over India if he like, and when he arrives at Galle he is not
bound to the route before mentioned to Melbourne. He can take
steamer to Singapore, and thence, by way of Torres Straits
touching at various points, including Batavia, Somerset, ant
Bowen, reach Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, and Sydney,
the capital of New South Wales. From Sydney there are frequent
steamers to New Zealand. . ,
The following approximately represents the time from England
to New Zealand by the various routes : By sailing vessel, 90 days ;
by San Francisco route, 41 days; by route by sea through the Canal
to Suez by Galle and Melbourne, G 1 days; by overland to Brindisi,
nnd by railway across Isthmus of Suez, 53 days; by overland to
Brindisi by Singapore, Brisbane, and Sydney, 61 days. .
Not without an object have I thus referred to the various ways
of reaching New Zealand. Some of my audience, thoroughly
familiar with what I have described, will, I fear, accuse me of a
oommonplace introduction. But there are many who take an in
terest in the Colony less well informed than those, of my hearers to
whom I have alluded. At any rate, most people will agree with me
that the circumstances of a country cannot be well understood
unless amongst those circumstances is taken into account its
connection and means of communication with other countries.


This brings me to two remarkable facts; facts which will, I
think, materially shape the future destiny of New Zealand, viz.
there is no country of any moment which possesses in proportion
to its area such an extensive sea-board, nor is there any civilised
country of importance so completely isolated from other countries.
It is customary to term New Zealand the Great Britain of the
South, but Great Britain is twenty miles from Europe, New Zea-
land a thousand miles at the least from Australia. Its immense
sea-board must inevitably tend to make New Zealand an essentially
maritime country. Its isolated position, not I admit without some
disadvantages as regards commerce, has compensating qualifica-
tions —in the self-helpfulness, self-reliance, and love of country it
is calculated to produce. Without any artificial fiscal provi-
sion, it gives great advantage to local productions and manufactures.
They start in the race favourably weighted in competing with
foreign producers. When it is considered that its mineral wealth
is abundant, and that it can produce all the staples that thrive in
climates varying from the temperate to the sub-tropical, it will be
seen that within itself New Zealand is almost the epitome of a
whole hemisphere. Within its narrow limits thousands of different
interests will, in course of time, materially aid each other.
Pray do not do me the injustice to suppose that I wish to see
New Zealand independent of other countries, or think that her
being so would be a source of profit to herself. The great indus-
tries of the country will grow only by competition with other
countries. Time will gradually show what the Colony can do
best itself, what it can best procure from abroad, and what it can
best supply in exchange.
A long line upon the waters, the three islands of New Zealand
extend over a length of nearly 1,200 miles. Their general direction
is north-north-east to south-south-west. North and south the
islands extend about 900 miles, so that they possess a great variety
of climate. Southland is of nearly the same temperature as Eng-
land, the north of Auckland is semi-tropical. The average breadth of
the islands is about 120 miles. No part of the Colony is distant from
the sea-coast more than seventy-five miles. At Auckland the island
narrows so that from coast to coast can be reached in six miles.
The north island is about 500 miles long; its greatest breadth
about 250 miles. The south island is about the same length—its
greatest breadth 200 miles. The area of the north island is about
44,000 square miles, or rather less than than of England. The
area of the south is 55,000 square miles, or about the size of Eng-
land and Wales. The two islands are separated by Cook’s Straits,


thirteen miles across at the narrowest part. Stewart s Island is
to the south of the Southern (sometimes called Middle) Island, and
is separated from it by Fouveaux Straits. The three islands have
an area almost equal to Great Britain and Ireland.
Let us run rapidly over them. But first it must be remarked
that though as separate governments the provinces cease to exist,
still as provincial districts they constitute convenient geogiaphical
divisions. Let us suppose ourselves at Auckland, on the east coast
of the province of the same name in the North Island. Auckland
possesses in the waters of the Waitemata and the surrounding
scenery one of the loveliest harbours in the world. For beauty it
is often joined with the celebrated harbours of Bio Janiero, of
Naples, and of Sydney. To the north of Auckland the province
extends some 200 miles. The water facilities of this portion of the
Colony are very considerable. Here dwells the Ngapuhi tribe of
Maories, as the native race are termed, whose lasting adherence to
the English rule have gained for them the title of the “ loyal Ngapuhi.
At the Bay of Islands, 120 miles north of the city of Auckland,
the treaty of Waitangi, by which the Maories acknowledged them-
selves British subjects, was signed in 1840. The capabilities of
the northern part of the Auckland province have as yet been
sparingly developed. It is known to contain large deposits of coal,
it possesses splendid forests of the far-famed kauri tree, its soil
yields well to the cultivator. I scarcely think that we know yet
for what production that soil is best suited. There is a railway at
the Bay of Islands, to connect the coast with the principal coal-
field of this part of the Colony. Some portion of a railway has
already been constructed which will ultimately connect Auckland
with the northernmost part of the island.
Let us return again to Auckland city. Some few hours y
steamer, without leaving the waters of the harbour, the gold-fields
of the Thames and of Coromandel can be reached, situated on
either side of the Frith of Thames. Splendid gold mines have
been found and are being worked on both these fields. Fifty mfies
further up the Thames Eiver there is the Ohinemun district,
supposed to be rich in gold, but which has hitherto not been much
worked, containing also rich agricultural land. Coming ack
again to Auckland, six miles across a narrow isthmus, the
west coast of the island is reached, and here is situated the Manu-
kau harbour. The entrance to the Manukau is not good m all
weathers. The harbour itself is serviceable, and is much used by
steamers. From the Manukau the route to the south is shorter
than by the east coast. Some forty miles from Auckland the


Waikato district commences. This was conquered from the
natives in the war which commenced in 1863. It is a rapidly-
improving district, containing a large area of good land, some of
which is still in the hands of the natives. Cultivation is pro-
ceeding within it to an immense extent. It is already connected
with Auckland by railway, and the extension of this railway will
ultimately connect Auckland with the southern part of the island.
The Waikato is a fine river. It finds its exit on the west coast,
thirty miles south of the Manukau heads. The provincial district
of Auckland is very extensive, and varied in point of resource. It
has a delightful climate, a large quantity of excellent land, and
great mineral wealth. Its forests are magnificent. In Auckland
only is the giant kauri pine tree found.
Let us now proceed south from the Waitemata harbour. In
a few hours the steamer passes Tauranga and Opotiki, both fine
settlements, and both also subjected to the use of the colonists by
the results of the 1863 war. The last is in the Bay of Plenty.
Here the island widens out, the east cape is rounded, and we soon
come to Gisborne, a rising town on the shores of Poverty Bay.
The district of this bay is by no means of the character its name
would denote, but, on the contrary, possesses some of the richest
land in the colony. Here are found innumerable springs of petro-
leum oil. Efforts are being made to obtain this valuable product
in quantity by boring. The amount obtainable on the surface is
-comparatively small. After passing Poverty Bay, the province of
Hawke Bay is reached, and we soon come to its capital, Napier,
one of the most rising towns in the Colony. There is splendid
land in the province of Hawke Bay. Before proceeding further
south, mention should be made of the Taupo Lake in the interior
of the island, which has for a long while been regarded as a key of
surpassing importance towards securing the peace of the whole
island. Happily the relations of the two races no longer make it
necessary to look upon Taupo from that strategical point of view
which at one time invested it with much interest. Nor must
we leave the interior of the island without a reference, however
bare, to the numerous hot and cold mineral springs possessing
curative virtues of the highest moment. From the well-authenti-
cated cures traced to these waters, it is not too much to expect that
the day will come when they will share with similar springs in
Europe the visits of invalids. Already they are much resorted to
from all parts of New Zealand, from Australia, and from India.
We leave Napier, and, in from twenty-six to thirty hours, reach
Wellington, the seat of government of the Colony. Wellington


possesses an excellent harbour, and is the port of a large extent
of productive country. No town in Colony, is advancing
more rapidly in wealth and importance than Wellington. It is
the capital of the province of the same name. We will now go back
to Auckland, and start from the Manukau harbour. In a few
hours we reach New Plymouth, the capital of Taranaki province.
This district has been called the garden of the Colony. It is
impossible to overrate its value. In past times it has unhappily
been the scene of native troubles. In proportion, indeed, to its
value seems to have been the reluctance of the natives to allow it
to pass to the use of the colonists. The country in which dwells
the people of the so-called Maori between New Plymouth
and the centre of the Waikato district. Although for years there
has been no open hostilities with the king, he has dwelt in his
country in more or less sullen isolation, not violating the laws, but
declining to come within the pale of European settlement. In 1873,
Sir George Arney, the Acting-Governor, my colleague the late Sir
Donald McLean, and I, were accidentally compelled by stress of
weather to take shelter in the harbour of Kawhia, situated a little
above New Plymouth. Kawhia is the last harbour that remains
exclusively in the Maoris’ hands, and so highly do they value it that
no provocation lias ever beenglield sufficient to justify our taking it
from them, as, of course, could easily have been done during the
times of war. On the occasionjjto wliichjl refer, a touching interview
took place on board our little vessel between Sir Donald McLean
and the king’s son. Great benefit arose from this interview. It
led to an approach to friendly relations with the king, and at
length, in 1875, Sir Donald McLean met the king at Waitomo.
The anxious desire, impossible to be realised, of the king to be
restored to his old territory of Waikato has delayed the completion
of terms of amity and friendship with the king and his followers.
Sir Donald McLean, whose life was passed in devoted efforts to
ameliorate the condition of the native race, and to bring into
harmony the relations of the two races, died scarcely more than a year
ago. Before he passed away “to the great majority,” he had the
happiness of knowing that his life-long labour had borne fruit, that
all fear of anything like a native war had ceased to exist, and that
time and negotiation only were required to settle the exact terms
of a peaceful settlement of all past differences with the Maories.
The Maori is a noble specimen of man ; there is little doubt that
he comes from the fine race that people the island of Sumatra. No
one ever understood more thoroughly than Sir Donald McLean
what was needed to bring the Maori to civilisation. Useful


labour was the great object for the Maori which he always kept in
view. In the love of and capacity for work he the boundary
lines between civilised and uncivilised races. The one has
aspirations utterly unknown to the other. The process of civilisa-
tion may be described as that of teaching to uncivilised man that
his life has greater objects than those of mere existence ; that he has
not merely to live himself, but to aid by his life the lives of others ;
that there is a to-morrow as well as to-day ; that the path of
improvement is of practically illimitable extent; that nothing worth
having can be reckoned on without true, hard, and conscientious
work ; and, above all, that the great Creator of the Universe has so
fashioned man, that whilst his improvement is due to his own
exertions, those exertions are themselves a source of happiness,
and no existence is so miserable as that which is devoid of occupa-
tion. The humblest member of a civilised race looks forward to the
possibility of improving his position. The unwritten condition of
civilised existence is a continuous and innumerable series of grades,
and no civilised being is so high that he has not an ambition to
fulfil. The uncivilised man, on the other hand, has a craving for
rest. The dormant nobility of his character finds an ennobling
channel in an occasional lust of conquest, his idea of labour is to
obtain by force or stratagem that which does not belong to him.
In his mode of warfare he often shows that, given to him the
knowledge by which he may worthily use his powers, there are
within him the makings of a great human being.
The Maori was not an utter savage when we first knew him, and
it is far from improbable that he would have worked out to a great
extent his own civilisation. He wanted the knowledge that has
been handed down to civilised man from past ages. He was, however,
not without an appreciation of the value of labour. The mission-
aries found him of a reverent nature, and eager to imbibe their
teachings. The wars which from time to time desolated the
Colony threw the Maori back, for in time of war, alas! the sword
is the sole medium of education. It was on the eve of the greatest
of New Zealand wars, that James Edward Fitzgerald, in deploring
its necessity, predicted that war would never gain the end we
wanted. With powerful effect he quoted the well-known lines
Bulwer has placed in the mouth of the Cardinal Prince :
“ Beneath the rule of men entirely great
The pen is mightier than the sword. Behold
The Arch-Enchanter’s wand —itself a nothing—
But taking sorcery from the master hand
To paralyse the Caesars !
Take away the sword,
States can be saved without it.”


In after years we learnt to realise this, and yet that we did so we
owe to the chivalry of the Maori race. In 18G9, the British
Government decided to remove every soldier from New Zealand.
To make the desertion thoroughly complete, the warlike stores,
even I believe the flags, were sold or handed over. So complete a
renunciation seems peculiarly marvellous now, compared, as one
cannot help comparing it, with the active aid which a different
party in power are at present lending to another Colony. I have
heard that the desertion of New Zealand has been boastfully
justified by the result. It would be well for those who dare indulge
in the boast to be silent whilst men still live who know the inten-
sity of the danger to which the mercenary conduct of the Govern-
ment of Great Britain subjected the colonists. To the chivalry of
the Maories themselves, indeed, is largely due the fact that frightful
disaster did not follow the mother-country’s desertion of her young
offspring. Had Titokowaru and Te Kooti, who were in arms on the
opposite coasts of the north island, united, and the king joined
them, immense losses would have followed. It has always seemed
to me that the Maories themselves, in scorn of the desertion, felt
more friendly to the colonists in consequence. One thing at least
may be said, the abandonment of Great Britain led the colony
to adopt that bold scheme of immigration and public works to
which I shall presently refer.
It is due to the present native minister, Mr. Sheehan, to say,
that notwithstanding past political differences he has generously
recognised the value of Sir Donald McLean’s policy and labour.
In an elaborate and able statement of the native position and future
native policy, Mr. Sheehan used some words which I quote, as their
assuring effects may be valuable: “ Now I come to a question
which has been raised on several occasions by the public press—
namely, the possibility of another native outbreak. In the first
place, I will mention to the House what is at the present time the
precise number of the native population. The last census, taken
in 1874, gave us the following return: For the North Island—males,
23,649 ; females, 19,769; or a total of 43,418. The population of
the South Island is about 3,600, making a gross total of about
46,000. We must also remember how that population is dis-
tributed. A large portion of it is to the north of Auckland, another
large portion is located between Auckland and the Waikato,
another large portion is situated on the East Coast, and yet another
large portion is located in Hawke’s Bay. I say that in all these
districts the chances of a native outbreak are absolutely infini-
tesimal. The natives of those districts themselves would, when


ever called upon, do as they have done before—assist us to put
down any native outbreak. If there be any part of the native
population in the North Island who we may expect would he the
prime movers in a native outbreak it is those who live in the King
country. The King country contains only 5,255 persons, and of
these hut 2,856 are males. Of course we must not forget that when
a crisis comes a number of native women can take up arms, and
use them with considerable effect; but, looking at the fact that we
have 25,000 or 30,000 loyal natives on our side, the chances of a
native outbreak are simply nil.”
The greatest efforts are now made to educate Maori children,
and especially they are taught the English language. In two
generations, such of them as remain will, in my opinion, be an
educated and civilised people, and from them the race will in-
crease and be renewed.
But we must rejoin our steamer at New Plymouth. We pass
the enormous Mount Egmont, rising almost sheer from the sea-
coast. Frequently on a bright day a cloud will envelop the middle
of the mountain, but above it clear in the sunshine will be seen
an immense snow-covered pyramid suspended apparently in mid-
air. We come to Cook’s Straits, and pass not far from the entrance
to Wanganui, a town situated in the river of the same name.
Wanganui is supported by a splendidly productive district, and has
a great future before it. Between Wanganui and Wellington is
the Feilding Settlement. It is, I venture to think, of peculiar
interest to us, for it has, so to speak, something of the character of
this Institute. We all know how much the Colonial Institute is
indebted to the constant support it has received from its President,
the Duke of Manchester. The Feilding Settlement is similarly
indebted to the same support. It is conducted by the Emigrant
Aid Association, of which his Grace is chairman. I have pleasure
in adding that the Settlement promises, like this Institution, to be
a great success.
We now come to Wellington. The distance to it by water from
Manukau is much less than by the east coast, so that the usual water
route from Auckland to Wellington is by the Manukau and west
coast.
A few words now about the railways in the North Island. Their
general design is a complete trunk from Wellington to Auckland,
with a branch to the east or west coast, according as it may be
decided whether the main line shall run along the east or west coast.
The railway is being constructed from Wellington to the Manawatu
Gorge, which lies about 100 miles to the north-east of Wellington.


It is nearly opened to the prosperous Wairarapa district. From
Napier the railway is being taken towards the Manaw r atu Gorge.
On the west coast from Wanganui the line is also being taken toward
the same point, so that from Wellington there will be a line bifur-
cating at the Manawatu, to Napier on the one side and to Waganui
on the other. From Wanganui the line is continued towards New
Plymouth to the north, whilst from New Plymouth it is being carried
south towards Waganui. I have already said that the line has been
carried from Auckland to the Waikato. It is a question how
the line is to be taken from the Waikato south. Is it to be carried
to the east of Lake Taupo to Hawke Bay, or westward to New Ply-
mouth ? The latter route has hitherto been forbidden. It passes
through the heart of the King country. The number of white men
who are acquainted with this country are very few. I observe
it stated in the papers that Sir George Grey hopes to be able to
obtain the consent of the natives to carrying the railway through
their land from Waikato to New Plymouth. Ido not hesitate to
say if this can be done its effects will be, economically, commer-
cially, and politically, most beneficial. In my opinion such a
through communication w T ould so operate on the widely ramified
interests of the whole Island as intrinsically to largely increase the
value of the land in it available for cultivation. The money value
arising from the proposed communication might be set down in
millions.
We will now pass to the middle, or south Island. Suppose that
we take steamer from Wellington, we can reach Nelson, the capital
town of the provincial district of the same name, in a very few
hours. Nelson possesses one of the most enjoyable climates in the
world; the town itself is like a large garden. There is a great
deal of business carried on between it and the gold-fields of the
west coast of the middle island. There is a railway for a few miles
out of Nelson, but it is not yet decided how Nelson will be brought
into communication with the rest of the middle island railway
system. For many years gold was known to exist on the upper
part of the west coast, but the results were small until about
1864-65. I can well remember that up to this time the greater
part of the west coast was considered absolutely worthless. The
popular idea of it was that it always rained there, that the soil had
become a sort of peat from the constant damp, and that even
wealth would be dearly purchased by an enforced residence there.
But the great wizard Gold has changed all this. He waved his
wand, and just as he had previously done for Otago, and earlier still
for Victoria, he wrought with the magic of the auri sacra fames a


change so prodigious that it is difficult to believe in the anterior
condition. That territory, regarded as worthless in 1864, has up
to the end of 1876 produced gold to the value of £14,000,000.
Prosperous towns have come into existence, and gradually the
settlement is progressing further south. Gold, as is usually the
case, has proved the forerunner to further wealth. Coal of a
splendid description has been found along the coast in great abun-
dance, and is about being worked on a large scale. The forests
of the west coast contain excellent timber, and are very extensive.
Proceeding south along the west coast, we pass Westport, at the
mouth of the Buller Biver, Greymouth on the Grey Biver, and
then we leave Nelson for the Westland provincial district.
It is this province, which is the new territory opened since 1864, to
which I have referred. Previously there had been some, but not
much, settlement on the west coast of the Nelson province. Hoki-
tika, a thriving town, twenty miles from the Grey, is the capital of
Westland. A great deal of settlement is proceeding further south.
Its traces are to be seen occasionally from the steamer. But the
gazer as the vessel steams on loses all interest in man’s puny
work in the stupendous efforts of nature, the records of which
meet his eye in the grand scenery of the west coast. A word must
be said about the Sounds. Within them a large vessel may go close
to the shore, and be moored to the trees. The southerly part of the
west coast is grandly picturesque. Its resources are little known.
Steps are being taken to open constant communication between it
and the gold-fields of Otago. It should be observed that Westland
extends south only to the Awarua Biver, in latitude about 44° S.
Beyond it is Otago, which stretches across the island from east to
west. Out of the southern extremity the Southland province was
carved. Bounding the island, and passing through Fouveaux Straits,
which separate it from Stewart’s Island, we come in the straits to
Southland’s port, the Bluff, and twenty miles inland is Southland’s
capital, the prosperous and highly-favoured town of Invercargill.
With a small gap only to be filled up you can travel by railway from
the Bluff to Dunedin, passing through a large extent of cultivated
land, and wonderfully prolific agricultural and pastoral districts. The
steamer takes us in a few hours from the Bluff to Port Chalmers,
and eight miles further up the harbour we come to Dunedin.
Comparisons are odious, and it is by no means my purpose
to institute them between different parts of the Colony. But
I may say of the people of Dunedin that they have literally dis-
played a genius for commerce. The advancement of Dunedin is
one of the marvels, of which, indeed, there are several in the


Australasian Colonies. Dunedin is itself, to my mind, the Chicago
of Australasia.
We have reached Dunedin from Wellington by travelling all
round the west and south of the middle island. But direct from
Wellington, Dunedin is scarcely more than thirty hours steaming.
Before I leave Otago I must say that this province was originally
a Scotch settlement Sixteen years have passed since all idea has
been dispelled of maintaining in it an exclusively Scotch element.
The gold discoveries in 1861 suddenly brought to Otago a
large influx of population, and the old and the new, alter a little
effort, fraternised together. It may safely be said that the Scotch
distinction now only remains in the sterling character, frugality,
and indomitable perseverance of the people. Proceeding up the
coast north, Oamaru and Timaru are passed. Both these towns
are singularly thriving, and both owe their prosperity to the agri-
cultural and pastoral wealth of the districts of which they are. the
collecting points. After Oamaru we come to the Waitaki river,
which separates Otago from Canterbury. It is in the latter
province that Timaru is situated.
But we will not enter Canterbury by a back door. We must
land at its chief port, Lyttelton, which may be reached from
Wellington in about fifteen hours, and from Dunedin in about
twenty hours.
Canterbury was settled under the auspices of the Church ol
England. It curiously retains its English character. I have
frequently heard people say it is more English than any part,
not only of New Zealand, but of any other Colony they have visited-
The pioneers of Canterbury were a hardy, determined, and singu-
larly able body of men. Amongst them were some of conspicuous
ability. Need Igo further than to name John Robert Godley. How
frequently is it the case that the obstacles of nature educate men s
minds. The first settlers of Canterbury had to contend with a most
discouraging obstacle. Everything combined to recommend Christ-
church as the capital, but Christchurch was separated from the
port by a high range of rugged hills, well-nigh impassable. An
indifferent road was made by a large circuit, but the whole pro-
vince suffered materially from its isolation from the sea coast.
Then stepped forward William Sefton Moorhouse. What did .it
matter that the inhabitants were few ?—he had infinite faith in
Canterbury’s future, and he boldly persuaded these few people
to cut a tunnel under the hills at a cost of something like a
quarter of a million of money. It is this faith in the country’s
capabilities that has made New Zealand what it is. Mr. Macan-


drew, the superintendent of Otago, had as much faith in Otago
as his brother superintendent, Mr. Moorhouse, had in Canterbury,
and both in Otago and Canterbury they never failed to urge on
great works to open up the country. A history of the industrial
progress of these two provinces would fill a large volume. The
subject is so fascinating to me that I feel if I embarked on it I
should try your patience, and I have yet much to say.
Christchurch is a busy, prosperous place, with some of the
characteristics of an English cathedral city. In 1857 the popu-
lation was 973; it is now over 13,000. In 1857 the number
of houses was 177; the number is now nearly 5,000. The rail-
way from Christchurch goes north towards Marlborough. In
a few months the line south will be opened for traffic through to
Dunedin. At present there are some gaps not yet completed.
What shall I say of the far-famed Canterbury plain ? An enormous
plain without trees, and with great rivers liable at flood times to
carve out changes in their route—its first aspect could not have
been altogether charming. But the value of its land was recog-
nised, and the high price, for the Colonies, of £2 per acre was set
upon it with the right to select anywhere. For years and years
it has been greedily purchased, and though the best land has gone,
and the purchaser must now go back to the hills, the land hunger
still continues. To the end of 1876 the land revenue of Canterbury
amounted to £3,400,000. Of this £553,000 were obtained in 1876,
so that the demand has not ceased. When I say that it has not
been uncommon to get out of the land the first year more than its
cost, you will not wonder at the eagerness to purchase.
Before I take leave of Canterbury I must mention that between
Timaru and Lyttleton there is Akaroa, possessing a harbour
second to none in the Colony. I venture to predict that Akaroa
will become of great importance whenever, as sooner or later
must be done, communication is opened between it and the
interior.
I have now only to refer to the Marlborough Province. In four
hours from Wellington, Picton is reached. It is charmingly
situated, and possesses a splendid harbour. A railway of 20
miles takes one to the capital town of the Province-Blenheim.
Marlborough has great pastoral and agricultural resources, besides
extensive forests of useful timber. It has in addition mineral
wealth. A considerable quantity of alluvial gold has been found,
and lately I believe some rich auriferous quartz reefs.
I have travelled over New Zealand with you—in, I admit,
a most cursory manner—still I have endeavoured to*give you a


traveller’s view of its topography. From what I have said you will
have no difficulty in remembering that from Auckland you can
proceed east or west to Wellington. That in the first case you
will take Hawke Bay in your route ; in the second Taranaki. That
from Wellington west and south you reach Nelson and Westland ;
that you can reach the west of Otago and Southland also by that
route. Lastly, that the usual way to Otago and Southland is by
Lyttelton, Canterbury. And that Marlborough lies just across the
straits, a little out of the way of the direct route either to Canter-
bury or Nelson.
A few words now about the railways of the South Island. Their
general design is a through trunk line north and south. The con-
nection between Canterbury and Marlborough and Nelson has yet
to be made, as also the connection betwen the east coast and the
west. There are several branches, some of them indeed of such
importance as to partake of the character of main lines. Espe-
cially I may mention the line from Invercargill to the interior
lakes, with which Otago is richly gifted, as also the branch from
the important inland town of Tokomairiro to Lawrence, the centre
of a large gold-field. An equally important line through the
centre of Otago is projected, and in Canterbury there are several
branch lines.
I will not detain you with a long description of the political
institutions of the country; but the subject cannot be left altogether
untouched. Until quite lately the Colony was divided into ten
provinces. Each province was largely endowed with independent
powers of government, especially in relation to all subjects pertain-
ing to settlement. I attribute much of the past progress of the
Colony to the minute local care and emulation arising out of these
divisions. The time came when a variety of considerations led to
its being thought desirable to abolish the separate forms of pro-
vincial government, and this change was finally carried into opera-
tion little more than twelve months since. It was not effected
without a great deal of opposition. When the memory of the
bitterness and fierceness of the struggle is somewhat toned down, it
will, I think, be recognised that there was something peculiarly
creditable to the people of New Zealand in the manner in which
the contest was carried on. A larger and more complete revolution
of the kind could not be conceived ; yet it was effected without any-
thing in the nature of a disturbance from beginning to end. It was
in fact argued out, and the will of the majority was accepted. It
would have been unfortunate if such a change had been made
without that consideration which alone could spring from active
B


opposition. Who is there can fail to sympathise with those who,
not recognising the necessity for the change, tenaciously clung to the
institutions under which the Colony had conspicuously flourished ?
On the other hand, who can fail to respect the determination which,
founded on conviction, peacefully brought about the result ? lam
not now expressing an opinion on the merits of the subject; my
wish is to bring before you a people that can by constitutional
means only deal with the largest matters affecting its own
destiny.
There is now but one Government in the country. The Governor,
appointed by the Crown, acts only with the advice of his ministers,
and when that advice is not approved by the majority in Parliament,
he seeks fresh advisers, or commands a general election. Parlia-
ment, or the Assembly as it is called, consists of two Houses, the
one nominated by the Queen, i.e. the Governor, the other elected
by the people. If you ask me if a system of party government
prevails, I should be puzzled to reply in a very definite manner.
There is no doubt an approach to a party system, but parties have
little adhesion. Occasionally for a time, whilst a great question or
a decided policy is under consideration, parties hold well together ;
but rarely is there an instance of continued and prolonged party
organisation. No constituency ever requires more of a representa-
tive than the assurance that he will continue to support this or that
Government as long as he is able to approve its measures. I have
often asked myself, Are we in respect to party government in
advance or behind this country ? At the first blush it would
appear that want of age and of organisation explains the deficiency
in party cohesion, and that time will bring about a different state
of things. It may be so, but my observation of late years rather
leads me to conclude that party allegiance in this country is under-
going a weakening, not a strengthening process, and I am not sure
that the progress of education will not encourage a tendency to
relieve representatives from party organisation. Ido not say such
a result is desirable; indeed, I think it will make good government
very difficult. Be this as it may, it is of great interest to consider
whether the Colonial institutions, devised by modern thought, and
to a certain extent untrammelled by the tyranny of custom, are in
advance of the institutions from which they spring ; whether, in
fact, they will grow to be more like the original, or the original
approach to their shape.
I wish to give you as few statistics as possible, for I know how
dull it is to listen to a long array of figures, which it is difficult to
follow. I shall, in printing this paper, include a synopsis of the


statistics of the twenty-four years ending the 31st December, 1876.
These require to be studied to be understood.
I may, however, briefly read a few figures showing the results
of last year, 1877

A mere comparison of figures is apt to mislead. Especially is
this the case with regard to the figures relating to exports and im-
ports. It by no means follows that the largest aggregate of these
represents the largest prosperity. Let us take an example. We
will suppose that a given extent of land produces £lOO,OOO worth
of wool, which is exported, and in return for it £lOO,OOO worth
of wheat imported. We have here an aggregate of exports and
imports of £200,000. Now let us suppose that the land being partly
put under crop yields £lOO,OOO worth of wheat, and £50,000 worth
of wool; that the wheat is consumed in the country, that the wool
is exported, and that in return for it agricultural implements and
machinery are imported. We have here only an aggregate of
£lOO,OOO of exports and imports. There can be no question as to
which of the two examples is most favourable to the Colony, but
that one shows an aggregate exterior trade of only half that of the
less favourable condition. It would be well if this example, one of
many, were borne in mind, to lessen the tendency to draw deductions
from the mere quantities of exports and imports.
Save a few products of the sea, the land gives to man all that
he requires for his use, all that ministers to his comforts, all that
constitutes his luxuries. The land of New Zealand yields
largely and variously. First let me touch on its mineral wealth.

o convictions to 1870 aie onlj those in the Supreme Court. From 1871 to 1876 inclusive, the convictions in the Districts Courts are included.


Before 1861 some amount of gold was obtained from the Nelson
and Coromandel gold-fields, but it was not until in that year the
Otago gold-fields were discovered that New Zealand held high
rank as a gold-producing country. Since that time, including
1861, to the end of 1876, Otago, Westland, Nelson, Auckland, and
Marlborough have produced no less a quantity than 8,237,800
ounces, valued at £32,117,000. I believe the auriferous re-
sources of the country are as yet sparingly developed, and that
there remains to be obtained a vast quantity of alluvial and
quartz gold. Iron exists in great quantity, but the conditions
hitherto of population demand and mechanical labour have not
promoted its production. It is a wealth that only slumbers ; in
time it must prove of great moment. Copper has also been found
in quantity, and lately evidence has been shown of the existence
of extensive deposits of silver. The islands abound in coal of
different qualities. There is the lignite, little different from charred
wood; there is the brown coal, so much used on the continent;
and there is splendid bituminous coal, better in quality than the
famous Newcastle coal of New South Wales. One of the purposes
of some of the railways constructed has been to enable coal to be
economically obtained, and we may safely look forward to large
results in the future from this industry. During the five years
ended 1876 coal to the value of £1,000,000 was imported into the
Colony. The day is approaching when all such imports will be
unnecessary, and we may therefore consider that a virtually new
and growing industry, commencing with an average value of
£200,000, is added by the railways to the resources of the country.
Platinum, lead, tin, quicksilver, and bismuth have also been
discovered, but not as yet in quantity. There is reason to
believe that extensive deposits of the most valuable ore of
quicksilver exist. In various parts springs of petroleum oil well
to the surface. As yet no flowing wells have been struck, but
it is nearly certain they will be. The deposits in America are
decreasing, whilst the use of mineral oil is largely increas-
ing. At no distant date it is likely that adequate efforts will be
made to tap in quantity the petroleum which there is every
reason to suppose exists abundantly in parts of the Colony.
Chrome, manganese, and plumbago have been found in quantity.
New Zealand is rich in building stone of great variety. Around
Oamaru a white, easily-worked stone is obtained, for which
there is a large demand in Australia. From White Island, on the
east coast, there is reason to suppose sulphur in quantity can be
procured.


Tlie timber of New Zealand is of great variety, and some descrip-
tions are very valuable. The results obtained from pastoral
pursuits are truly astounding. During the fifteen years ending
1876 no less than £27,719,000 worth of wool was produced in and
exported from the Colony. The growth of the industry may be
gathered from the fact that the export of the first of these years,
1862, was £674,000, and for the last, 1876, £3,395,000.
It would be hard to exaggerate the agricultural value of a con-
siderable quantity of the land of New Zealand. The history of
New Zealand is one continued record of an increase in the value
of and demand for land. Of course the quality of the land varies
much. Some, such as the land on the plains, has a great depth of
soil; some is so rugged and at such an altitude as to be suitable
only for sheep, and some is too high even for that purpose. Pro-
bably experience has not yet proved what is the greatest use that
can be made of the land, especially of much of the land in the
North Island. But the results as they stand are sufficient to
satisfy the most exacting. I cannot profess to give you of my own
knowledge an analysis of the value of the land. Yet, as this is
the most important question in relation to the future of the Colony,
I feel that my task will be ill-completed if I fail to bring the matter
fully before you, but I must do it by the aid of others. I have
obtained permission to read to you portions of a letter, addressed
by Mr. Morton, the chairman of two companies owning 350,000
acres of land in New Zealand, to one of the officers of the companies
in the Colony, in which he particularly dwells on the value of New
Zealand land :
“ Mr. Ford’s estimate of the value of Acton at £7, as corrobora-
tive of our own, is satisfactory. My own conviction is that a
much greater rise in the value of good freehold land in New
Zealand is certain to take place, and this at a much earlier period
than you in the Colony or the public generally have any concep-
tion of. In looking into the agricultural returns of Great Britain,
with abstract returns for the United Kingdom, British possessions,
and foreign countries, for 1876, I find that the average yield ot
wheat per acre in New Zealand, out of the 90,804 acres under this
crop for 1875-6, was 81*6 bushels, while in Victoria, with its
321,401 acres, the average yield for the same year was only 15-5
bushels per acre ; New South Wales, with 133,610 acres, was 14*7;
South Australia, with 898,820 acres, was 11-8; Tasmania, with
42,745 acres, 16-4; Natal, with 1,740 acres, was 12-6; and Cape
of Good Hope, with 188,000 acres, was 8-9. Dominion of Canada,
for 1871, the latest date given, the average of the Lake Ontario


district is 6-4 ; Quebec, 8-5 ; New Brunswick, 10-8 ; Nova Scotia,
11.8. Then if we turn to tlie United States, the great competitor,
so to speak, for the population of Europe, the average yield of
wheat for 1874 (the latest date given) is 12-3 bushels per acre, and
the United Kingdom, in which the best of the land only is culti-
vated for wheat, and this highly cultivated and manured, only
yields an average of 27£ bushels per acre. I give you herewith in
a tabulated form the returns of cereal crops, so far as given in the
Blue-books, not only of the above, but also of the several countries
in Europe.”
“Fromthe tabulated statement (page 27) you will easily see that
when it comes to be generally known and understood in the United
Kingdom and Europe, as well as in Australia and America, that
the returns to an agriculturist are So superior in New Zealand to
those in other countries, and this with a climate relatively superior,
their attention will naturally, and as a matter of course, be con-
centrated upon New Zealand. If you only put down the cost of
ploughing, seed harrowing, reaping, thrashing, and carting to port,
all of which may be said to be nearly the same in the several
countries (reaping and thrashing alone excepted in Australia and
California, where, I understand, it is done by a special method,
with the straw left standing on the field), amtMnct these charges
from the returns the grain would yield ,-sikyf tit ss. per bushel all
round at shipping port, you will find the immeftge advantage in the
shape of returns to the agriculturisUin New Zealand from any of
the Australian Colonies, the Cape, - not
deal with Europe, is in the countries where the yield is great the
land is not only highly estivated -bfit heavily manured. Then,
when you take into consideration the feet that in all Australia the
land may be said, after being cropped, to be left in an unproductive
form, and allowed to revert to its natural state, no permanent pas-
ture of an artificial character (viz. English grass) is given for
Adelaide in 1876, and only 19,260 acres for 1875 ; for New South
Wales none stated; for Victoria, out of 1,126,000 as under crops
and grass, only 293,000 acres is given as under artificial grass; for
Western Australia and Queensland none given; and for Tasmania
(the most favoured for this of all the Australian Colonies), out of
332,000 acres, only 102,000 is given, or under one-tliird of the
whole: whereas in New Zealand, out of 2,877,000 acres, not less
than 1,770,000 acres is given as sown out in permanent artificial

out in English, grass ; but, on the other hand, they have a six
months winter, when the ground is wholly covered with snow, and
when there may be said to be no outside feed for cattle and sheep.
So far as I can make out all that can be said of small agriculturists
in Canada, the States, or in any of the Australian Colonies, the
yield of wheat per acre, or the returns therefrom, will only pay the
farmer fair wages for his own labour, or in some cases yield him
probably 10s. to 20s. per acre beyond this: whereas in New
Zealand, with the climate much more pleasant to work in than any
of the others, the farmer, after allowing himself wages at the same
rate as in the other Colonies for self, family, and horses—viz.
manual and horse labour—would have from £4 to £4 15s. per acre
net returns, instead of 10s. to 205., as in the others. Then, after
the land is cropped and sown out in English grass, the yield in
feed for sheep is four to five times (viz. equal to 20s. per acre
of yearly wool return) what it was previous to being broken
up and laid down in English grass, instead of (in Australia at
least) yielding less returns in pasturage than it did in its natural
state.”
‘ ‘ You will thus easily see how much better it will be for a man to
pay £lO per acre—ay, even £2O per acre—for good land in New
Zealand, than £1 to £2 per acre for fair land in Australia. The
cultivation of 20 acres of good land in Australia (I mean the labour,
and ploughing, sowing, harrowing, and reaping, thrashing, carting
to port, &c., cannot be put down with safety at under close upon
£3 per acre, basing my estimate upon the current rate of manual
and horse labour in the several Colonies. The returns from the
wheat crop in these Colonies will not yield ss. per acre over this
sum one year with another, whereas the returns from New Zealand
will yield £4 in excess of this. As before stated, lam taking the
wheat all round at ss. per bushel at the shipping port in the
several Colonies in this statement. From the foregoing it will be
seen that the net returns from wheat to the landowner, after pay-
ing £3 per acre for the manual and horse labour, is fifteen times
more in New Zealand than Australia and for the United States ;
and for years after the land has been cropped in Australia, it will
yield next to nothing, until the natural grass again springs up and
gets a sale, when two or three acres must go for each sheep:
whereas in New Zealand one acre of good English grass will keep
lour to five merino sheep, and for three cross breeds, over the year.
I daresay, when you have all the foregoing weighed over and
thought out, you will conclude with me that at no distant date
good agricultural land will be selling at £lO to £ls per acre in


New Zealand, according to quality and locality, and A 1 agricultural
land at from £2O to £25 per acre.”
“ In tlie returns on profit of one acre in New Zealand of wheat
against 15 or 20 acres, as the case may he, in Australia or America
—viz. the net returns after payment or allowance for labour, seed,
&c.—l omitted one very important item of outlay, viz. the fencing
of one acre, say in New Zealand, as against from 15 to 20 acres,
and the maintaining of said fences. I doubt not you will concur
with me in the rapid and permanent increase in value that must
necessarily take place on agricultural land in New Zealand, when
once the facts as already stated are known and generally recog-
nised.”
Another gentleman, a large landowner in the Colony, and enjoy-
ing exceptional opportunities of acquiring information, has furnished
me with the following memorandum: —
“A great deal of land will yield two grain crops in succession,
and after a green crop eaten on the land yield two more grain crops,
and so on, continuing to give two grain crops in succession for one
green crop, without any signs of failure. This can be done upon
the best agricultural land in the Middle Island, of which there is a
large area.”
I leave you to form your own opinion of these statements. This
I can say, I have been in other Colonies, but I never saw anywlieie
such earth-hunger as prevails in New Zealand amongst all classes
of its people.
I give you a statement prepared by Mr. Hayter, the Government
statist of the Colony of Victoria, of the average yield per acre of
the principal crops during the six years ending 1876, in the
Australasian Colonies, excepting Queensland, where complete
returns are not made :

You will not be surprised to learn that to make such land
accessible, has first and last been the primary public object of the
• colonists. The construction of ordinary roads was naturally the first
means adopted for opening up communication. It early dawned
upon the people that metalled roads, costing a great deal for annual
repair, and affording only slow transit, were deficient in economy
as compared with light and cheaply-constructed railways. It was
not, until 1870, that any comprehensive and large scheme
for the construction of railways was adopted. At that time the
colonists were compelled to seriously examine their position. ‘ The
mother-country had withdrawn all her troops and left the colonists,
owning but a mere fringe of settlement round the North Island, to
keep in check the natives, with whom over a series of years there
had been more or less constant fighting. It became evident that
the most ordinary precaution for the safety of the colonists
demanded a large increase of white population, the opening of
roads into the interior of the North Island, and the means to em
ploy the natives on peaceful instead of warlike pursuits. Equally,
the growing value of the agricultural and pastoral pursuits of the
people of the South Island made it Evident that light railways
would prove of the greatest benefit to them. And so what is known
as the Immigration and Public Works policy grew into life. It
was resolved to borrow money to make roads in the North Island,
to make railways in both islands, and to introduce immigrants. It


settlement there was a concurrent tlle hnd °Pened to

differences of opinion as to the routes and as in ™ ay be
should claim the first attention, but ’not as to the® P 1
railways themselves, and to the capability of the su^rt


them. The colonists are, in short, determined to open up the
country, and to make it the home of many times its present
population. There are many and warm differences of opinion on
various subjects, but as to this one there is unanimity of feeling.
The Colonial Treasurer stated last session “ that up to the end
of June, 1877, the gross public debt of the Colony, general
and provincial, including treasury bills, when the balances of
all loans now authorised are raised, will be £20,895,311. As
against this debt, we had a balance of £980,189 13s. Id. at
credit of the Public Works Account on SOtli June, £35,416 18s. 9d.
at credit of the Defence Loan Account, and accrued Sinking Funds
amounting to £1,353,562 2s. lOd.” He went on to say: “It may,
perhaps, be interesting to state the purposes for which the several
f loans, general and provincial, which constitute our national debt
have been raised, and the amount applied to each. I have ascer-
tained, by an examination of the several Loan Acts, that those
purposes and amounts may be classified thus : About £8,300,000
has been spent upon railways, £3,500,000 on immigration,
£4,400,000 on harbours, lighthouses, public buildings, roads,
bridges, and other public works for opening up the country;
£1,300,000 in the purchase of native lands, including the payment
of the debt to the New Zealand Company; £2,000,000 in the
suppression of the native outbreak, and the remaining £500,000
on miscellaneous purposes.” This estimate only charges to the
native outbreak the exact amount for . war purposes. A large
amount from the other items might be set dowm as expenditure
directly necessitated by the former relations between the two

\ -^ ie Colonial Treasurer who subsequently succeeded to office did
it impugn these figures, though he differed somewhat with his
as to the mode of dealing with the finance. He con-
pjicd that the floating debt should be added to the permanent
ebt, and that the revenue should be augmented by further taxation
xf necessaiy. In the meantime, he added to it by colonialising the
land fund. That is to say, lie added the land fund, which was
hitherto specially set apart for different purposes, to the consoli-
dated revenue, less 20 per cent, to be paid over to local bodies.
The consolidated revenue will be increased by this operation, no
of course to the full extent of the amount added, as some of the
charges on the land fund will devolve on the consolidated revenue,
but nevertheless the last-named revenue will be considerably
increased. To compare the public debt of New Zealand with

1 .Manuri oTMonal Debts, ’ pilblished by Mr. Dudley Baxter.
'Xe°Se e n, "s“a^Hatton, than calculations founded on


population in which considerations of relative income are entirely
left out.’ ”
Mr. Baxter estimated that the annual income of the people in
the United Kingdom in 1807 was 800 millions. It is now estimated
to be 1,200 millions sterling, showing an increase of 50 per cent.
The average income per head of population in 1867 was about £25 ;
it is now £36, or rather, perhaps I should say, that is the computa’
tion supposing, which is unfortunately not the case, that the working
classes are receiving an average amount of employment.
let us suppose the average earnings last year to be £36. The
average burden of the public debt was at the same time about
16s. 6d., which gives us 2-3 as the percentage which the annual
burden of the debt per head bears to the annual earnings. Careful
calculations made by a Royal Commission in the Colony showed that
the average earnings of the people of New Zealand in 1865 was £7B
per head. I have no means of making a fresh calculation for the
present period, but certainly it is not too much to consider that the
increase has been 50 per cent. Indeed, this increase is moderate
when one considers the rise in the value of the property, and the
results from accumulated profits. We have thus an annual income
head of £ll7. The burden of the debt on the SOtli June last per
was £2 6s. per head of population, exclusive of the Maoris, which
gives 2 as the percentage the debt bears to the earnings, as against
2-3 in the United Kingdom. But in the latter case the ddbt
does not represent railways, roads, works, docks,
schools, asylums, prisons, &c. To. make the comparison they
should be added, and they amount to more than the whole
national debt, so that, for the purposes of comparison, the
percentage of burden has to be doubled. The railways in this
country, being longer established, are, it is true, a little more *
remunerative, but against this we may, place the burden of
pauperism, which, capitalised, amounts to more than a fourth of
the national debt. When, too, it is considered that in the Colony
wealth is much more evenly distributed, whilst here there are
immense numbers of paupers and a few enormously rich men, who
equally, for the purpose of considering the average power of the
population to bear taxation, might be eliminated from consideration,
we may understand how light the average burdens of the Colony are
to its population as compared with those of the United Kingdom.
has to be remembered that in the United Kingdom there
is not. the land revenue which comes to the relief of the Colonial
burdens. Rents, too, and what may be called household taxes, are
greatly in excess, here of wjiat they arr in the Colony. These


estimates may appear to you exaggerated, but in reality they are
not, and they represent and explain the vast advantag e which t
working and middle classes in the Colony have over the same
classes in this country in regard to their present comforts and
future prospects.
As to the ability of the people of New Zealand to meet their loan
liabilities, it is utterly absurd to question it. It may be desirable
or necessary to increase the taxation; for obvious reasons this is a
political question on which I express no opinion. But I may say
that beyond all doubt the people can bear whatever extra burdens it
may be necessary to impose on them. If any tax m this conn ry
were abolished and the revenue showed a deficiency to the extent of
the tax, and the expenditure required the tax to be made good, all
that could be said would be that the taxpayers had saved paying
the tax, but owed the money. If the taxation m New Zealand is
not sufficient, it will have to be made so. There has been no
material increase of taxation since 1870. At a moderate esti-
mate the people are twice as wealthy, m my opinion many
times more wealthy. They can afford to pay five shillings where
they paid ohe.before. I know that the inclination to pay taxes does
not increase with the ability to do so, and fortunately this is the
case, for the greatest check on public extravagance is the indisposi-
tion of the people to be taxed. I am far from saying that extra
taxation will be needed, but if it is, the people of New Zealand could
better afford to double their present revenue than to contribu e
that they were called on to find before 1870. It must be borne
in mind, that during the construction of the railways interest
was paid on the cost before returns were received. The net
receipts from railways promise to become very large. Ihen as
to the land fund. The history of that up to the present time is
briefly this. To the 80th June, 1877, 8,830,000 acres were sold
for a sum amounting to £8,380,000, and for scrip to the value of
£2OO 000. Besides this, 89,000 acres were given for public works,
to the value of £87,000. In addition, 450,000 acres were given to
immigrants, 186,000 to naval and ? military settlers, and 890,000
acres put apart for reserves. Exclusive of native and confiscated
lands, there remain nearly 32,000,000 of unsold Crown lands. Of
fhe £8 380 000 which has been received in cash for land since t ic
commencement of the Colony to the 30th June, 1877 nolese than
£1,039,000 were received during the year 1876, equal to ,
more than the average of the last seven years. #
It is noticeable, that though there has always been free selection
in Canterbury, and the best land of course taken, the revenue last


year was larger than any year previously. Although the selector
has to go further back, he buys with more eagerness.
In the province of Otago the leases of the sheep farms fall in
during the next four or five years, and immense quantities of land
will be open for sale and lease. In the North Island vast tracts
acquired from the natives will be open to purchase, and I cannot
consider but that there will be a great increase in the land revenue.
The large demands made by New Zealand have naturally some-
what advanced the rate at which it is able to borrow. It pays the
extra price because it gains more by doing so than by suspendmg
the works which bring wealth to the country and its people. The
lenders may congratulate themselves on getting this extra rate.
The security afforded by the value of the public estate and
public works and railways, and by the ability of the people tc
contribute whatever is required of them, make, in my opinion.
New Zealand debentures as safe as Consols, and immeasurably
more safe than the investments made in countries where British
laws and institutions do not prevail. I read the other day of
an occurrence which I hope is true, for it is too good ko bo
otherwise. A person presented himself at a fancy dress ball in an
attire so scanty, or perhaps I should say a want of attire so con-
spicuous, that the servants denied him admission. “ But this is a
fancy dress ball,” he said. “Yes, sir; it is a fancy dress ball,”
with a marked emphasis on the word dress. “ But the guests are
to appear in character,” he persisted. “ Yes, sir; and wliat
character can you represent as you are ? ” “ The character,’ he
replied, “of a foreign bondholder stripped of everything.” You
may realise the difference when I say that the New Zealand bond-
holder who dressed for the character should appear in fine wool,
with the emblems of every useful metal, of coal, and of manufac-
tures abundantly worked in gold embroidery, and with a cornu-
copia as a head-dress. > .
On the subject of education I will briefly say that it has been
the pride of the several provinces to provide the most abundant
means for the education of children. The Colony lias not over-
looked the necessity of continuing this good work, and m the ses-
sion just over the educational provisions of the several provinces
have been consolidated into one comprehensive system of education,
the leading features of which may be summed up in the well-
known terms, free, secular, and compulsory. There are small
fees charged, but the general burden is defrayed from the revenue
and from the proceeds of valuable endowments. It may be said
in general terms that the State provides a secular cation, and


that it insists that every child shall be educated. It may, more-
over, be added that the public schools are not confined to elemen-
tary ones, and that children showing special aptitude for learning
may, however poor their parents, acquire a finished education in
advanced schools. The ranks of the civil service, too, are recruited
from those who show their aptitude by passing special examina-
tions.
From 1871 to 1876 the Colony assisted with passages 78,475 immi-
grants. Besides the cost of passages there were great expenses in
connection with receiving and housing the immigrants on arrival.
As a certain, and I may say large amount of responsibility is
recognised to belong to the Government to see that assisted immi-
grants obtain employment, you may readily conceive that the
utmost efforts have been made to chose suitable immigrants. You
may realise that out of so large a number some have not
proved suitable and some have not been fortunate, and you may
also recognise that whilst those who are successful say nothing, a
great deal of commotion may be made by comparatively a few who
are not so fortunate. Hence during the winter months sometimes
complaints have been heard, and letters embodying them have
found their way to papers in .this country. In consequence
of productions of the kind which appeared a few months since I
telegraphed for explanation to the Colony, and received in reply
the following communication :
“ Unemployed. Wherever meetings held, Government offered
work, thirty shillings week. Very few accepted. —Grey.”
It may safely be said that the bulk of the immigrants have
been greatly successful. But it would be a mistake to supposq
that New Zealand is a fairy land. As in other countries, some
people are unfortunate without having themselves to blame,
whilst there are some who, not being able or willing to work,
are prone to attribute to the country the fault which belongs to
themselves. Comprising as the Colony does a great many settle-
ments, there is constantly a liability to an undue congregation in
some parts and a reverse in others. With respect to artisan labour,
there is also a special risk of temporary excessive supply in some
districts and want of supply in others. No one should go to the
Colony who does not take with him a determination to endure, if
need be, some hardship. The primary business of the Colony is to
obtain the products of the land, whether agricultural, pastoral, or
mineral. All other occupations are subsidiary, and their success
depends on the plentifulness which the land yields. Professional
men, men who can only give clerical labour, and artisans, must


depend on those who earn from the land the means of paying
them ; hence they should he very cautious of going to the Colony
without receiving direct encouragement to do so. Persons who
possess capital and agricultural knowledge may depen on pr
curing land, and if their knowledge is adequate they should have
no difficulty in being successful, provided they are able to exercise
frugality and self-denial. Women suited for domestic service are
always in demand, and probably will continue to be so for a long
period. They soon marry, and so leave again the gap m the
ranks of servants which they only for a time stopped. Ordinary
labourers are wanted. It will of course he understood that as
the supply varies there may he variations in the remunera-
tion offered, hut remuneration is largely in excess of the wages
in this country, whilst bread and meat are much cheaper.
Those who are well acquainted with agriculture, and who aspire to
positions beyond those of ordinary labourers, but are unable to
take with them capital, must remember, that though they take to
the Colony most useful knowledge, they cannot look for immediate
employment equal to their merits. A farmer or capitalist may
continually want labour, but may not at a moment's notice be
prepared to make such alterations in his arrangements as
would be involved in the employment of overseers or persons
of an analogous rank. Hence the agriculturist without capital
or means must not consider that he is at all assured of a
once realising his aspirations for a superior position Men
with large families should understand that tlieir risks are
increased : not only have they more mouths to feed, but they are
more liable to the effects of illness or accidental misfortune. With
such a disposition to meet with patience any difficulties that
might arise as would have to be exercised m this country, there
cannot, I think, be a doubt that the general prospects of the working
classes, and of men with capital, are infinitely brighter m o\
Zealand than in this country. Here there is an excess o pop
tion, the possession of capital from £250 to £5,000 is a sourc
of embarrassment, and men of means and position arernU
to decide what to do with their sons growing to>
There, there is a land of infinite capacity, greatly deficient m
population, and offering large rewards to suitable colonists
have the courage not to be deterred by slight obstacles, and who
expect 100 much. Immigrants, it should be observed
require some amount of self-reliance. The landing amongst
strangers, in a strange place, is depressing, and those who
expect 400 much may be disappointed. There are some people,


too, so constituted as never to be contented. The more they
prosper the less satisfied are they with their progress. I have met
many such people. With these reservations the Colony offers
great inducements to emigrants. Let me, however, say that
nothing can be more unwise than to send out vicious youths in the
hope that they will improve. The temptations to, and facilities
for, indulging in vice are as great in the Colony as elsewhere, and,
removed from the supervision of their friends, such youths are
nearly sure to turn out badly.
In confirmation of what I have said, I may quote the following
passage from a despatch which I received only yesterday from the
Minister for Immigration: “As regards future operations, Iliad
hoped by this mail to have supplied you with full particulars as to
the probable number and quality of immigrants required during
the current year. So soon as lam furnished with returns ordered
to be sent in by the Immigration Officers throughout the Colony,
I shall be able to do so. In the meantime I would state that we can
scarcely have too many people, provided they are of the right
stamp—agricultural able-bodied labourers, dairy-women, and
domestic servants. The power of the Colony to absorb such with
advantage may be said to be unlimited. Another class to whom
the Colony presents great advantages are practical farmers, with
small or large means. The construction of railways now in progress
and in contemplation, opens up for agricultural settlement an
extensive territory which has hitherto been unavailable, and upon
which thousands of industrious families may acquire independence,
and surround themselves with comfort. I venture to say that
New Zealand never presented greater attractions to genuine
colonists than at the present time.”
The land system of the Colony is a subject upon which there is
a great deal of inquiry. It is the more necessary to touch upon
this, because of important alterations which have been made by an
Act passed during the late session. Chief amongst the changes,
though it pertains rather to the financial than the land system, is
the provision which has been made by Act by which henceforth
the Land Revenue, less twenty per cent, for local purposes,
becomes part of the general, or, as it is called, the conso-
lidated revenue of the Colony. Previously the land fund was
virtually provincial revenue, and on the abolition of the provinces
it was contemplated to still put it apart for special purposes. But
it has now been made Colonial revenue. It is not for me to express
an opinion as to the policy or fairness of the measure. But I
may say that one of its obvious effects will be to somewhat


remove the inequalities of expenditure in various parts of the
Colony.
Of great importance both to the land system and the finances of
the Colony is another measure passed last session, by which the
upset price of land has been raised to not less than £2 per acre if
open to free selection, and to not less than £1 per acre if submitted
to auction. In Canterbury the upset price at which anyone might
select land has always been £2 per acre, but in other provinces the
upset price of rural land, whether for free selection or by auction,
has varied from 2s. 6d. to £l, unless in cases of special value.
The increase now made is very material. It is as it were the
crown of the public works and immigration policy. I have
already referred to its money value. The change, too, probably
means an approach to a uniform land system throughout the
Colony. At present each provincial district has a distinct land
system; indeed in Otago there are two systems, one belonging to
the old province of Southland. The working of the Act will not
have much interest for you, but very many persons here will be
interested to know that provision has been made for putting up
to auction licenses to use pastoral country after the present leases
or licenses expire. A great many runs (as large sheep-farms are
called) will be put up to auction in this way during the next five or
six years in the province of Otago.
An important new provision is that pastoral lands may be sold
on deferred payments in blocks of not less than 500 acres, nor more
than 5,000 acres. Such blocks must be put apart for the purpose
by the Governor. They must be offered at auction at an upset
price of not less than £1 per acre, and the payment has to be made
by thirty equal half-yearly payments. No person is allowed to
purchase on deferred payment more than one allotment, and one of
the conditions is that within twelve months he shall reside on the
land, and continue to reside on it for five years, except during
intervals of leave, not exceeding three months in the year, permitted
by the Crown Lands’ Board.
There are also provisions for selling rural or agricultural land on
deferred payments. No one is allowed to purchase more than 320
acres, and the price is divided into twenty half-yearly payments.
If the land purchased is open to selection, to the ordinary cash
price, 50 per cent, is added to cover the interest on the deferred
payments. If the land is sold by auction, the price is the amount
bid. In either case the payment is divided into twenty equal
half-yearly payments.
The purchase of rural land by deferred payments is subject to

I have given you ’ as much as my limits will permit and my
. bihty allow, an idea of New Zealand. I feel that I have
done inadequate justice to its great capabilities, that I have
insufficiently described all that convinces me there is “ no land on
earth that has before it a fairer promise. With a superb climate
and every other natural advantage in its favour, it has been care-
u y peopled by those who can best serve it, and who must become
ie lounders of a hardy, enterprising, and able branch of the British
icc. o maivel is it to me that they who have lived in New
Zealand learn to love it, for I share that feeling. To describe it is
of BjTon— )OUf ° f loVe ’ It S6emS t 0 me a land tliat ’ in tlie words
“ Must ever be
Tlie master mould of Nature’s heavenly hand,
Wherein are cast the heroic and the free,
The beautiful, the brave—the lords of earth and sea.”
And now I will say a few words of the South Sea Islands,
* Zcaland muat be m the future to these Islands the central-
guiding figure. No adequate idea of New Zealand’s future can by
formed that excludes from view the teeming Islands of the Pacific
that must look to her as their trading centre. The winds and the


waves which make communication between the Islands and Aus-
tralia a work of difficulty, make communication between them and
New Zealand a matter of ease. It w T as a wise step of the British
Government to take possession of Fiji. Wiser still would it be to
take possession of the Samoa and New Hebrides groups. Chief
amongst the present exports of the Islands is copra, as dried cocoa-nut
is called. An unlimited demand exists for it in Germany, and there
it finds its chief market. It is brought home in a dried form, but
I am glad to learn that at Auckland in New Zealand a factory has
just been established to obtain from the copra its useful products.
From Fiji the export of copra increased from £5,000 in 1873 to
£41,000 in 1876. The total imports to Fiji in 1876 were £112,000,
the exports £107,000. The latest returns I have of Samoa, 1875,
show during that year total export of £227,000, and an impoit
trade of £241,000. Of the exports £IOI,OOO was in copra. The im-
ports included £20,000 in specie, and £20,000 worth of guano for
re-export.
There can be no doubt of the capabilities of the Islands. They
yield many valuable indigenous products, and they are suitable
for the production of coffee, sugar, cotton, tobacco, ariowroot,
indiarubber, maize, and various kinds of drugs.
Her Majesty’s present Government have cast loving eyes towards
them, and have proceeded probably in the iiath of annexation as
far as the state of public opinion has permitted. By an inge-
nious Act of Parliament passed three years ago, they have obtained
the right to exercise considerable power in the Islands not annexed.
Sir Arthur Gordon, Governor of Fiji, exercises under the Act the
functions of High Commissioner. Too little time has elapsed to
fairly test the Act, but it must at least be conceded that during
the last few years Her Majesty’s Government have done a gieat
deal to improve the condition of the Islands. Not too soon was
action taken. The Islands were becoming the Alsatia of the two
hemispheres, and a disgusting traffic in human labour was being
set up. Sir Arthur Gordon seems to be doing his work well, with
not much means placed at his disposal. He has. shown great
vigour in repressing revolt, and industry in developing the capa-
bilities of the natives to submit themselves to organised govern-
ment. In the measure he has taken for raising taxes in produce,
he recognises the value to which I have already alluded of civilising
the natives by encouraging them to work. He has, I fancy, not
been unmindful of the Java system. I know it is the fashion to
condemn that system as one of slavery. But there is a wide
difference between the State insisting on work as a necessary


condition of tlie well-being of a semi-savage race, and allowing
individuals to traffic in human labour. I have met several men who
have made themselves acquainted with the Java system, and whilst
not entirely approving it they have all seen much to admire in it.
Practically it has been successful in its results to the natives and
Europeans. Sir Arthur Gordon is, I believe, not popular with the
Europeans. I doubt if any Governor who did justice to the native
race in a country in Fiji’s present position would be popular with
the white man. I speak with reservation, as I am only imper-
fectly acquainted with Sir Arthur Gordon’s conduct. I convey
the impression left in my mind by so much as I know of ih The
French, Germans, and Americans have very large interests in the
Southern Seas. It is to be hoped they will not some day clash
with those .of England. If they do not, luck rather than good
management will have to be thanked, for certainly no zeal was
shown to protect English interests till public scandal made it
necessary to do so. It is a deplorable pity that New Caledonia
was suffered to become a French penal settlement. From a state-
ment lately made it appears that Sir George Grey urged on the
English Government to annex New Caledonia before the French
entertained the idea of doing so._ '
I proposed when I commenced to connect my subject, New
Zealand and the South Sea Islands, with that larger subject, the
Consolidation of the Empire. The lengthened demand I have
made on your attention leads me to fear to ask your larger indul-
gence ; at any rate, I will be brie£ Almost every salient matter
to which I have referred seems to me to instigate consideia-
tions of vast interest to other parts of the Empire than that small
portion with which we have had to deal. The various routes to
New Zealand remind us how much one country is dependent on
other countries, and, from a national point of view, suggests how
important it is to keep open a chain of communication from one
end of the world to the other, at every stopping-place of which the
interests of Great Britain should be paramount. The facts which
I have told you about the lands of New Zealand, and about what
has been done by the Colony in the way of promoting immigration,
together with your own knowledge of the land, and immigration
policies of other Colonies, must suggest to you how unmindful of
the interests of the parent country itself were those who left to
the hazard of the decision of a few thousand colonists the dealing
with questions of vast moment to the whole people. There is
no want in Great Britain more felt than that of a career for youths
growing to manhood. The openings for those who are inclined to


sedentary pursuits are few, and fewer still are the openings for
those who love the freedom of healthy, active, outdoor pursuits.
When territories worth countless millions of mcney were relin-
quished with no conditions imposing on the Colonies the necessity
of throwing open those lands to the use of settlers, and no obliga-
tion to expend part of the proceeds in assisting the hard-worked
labourers of this country to emigrate, a great wrong was committed
to those whose property was so rashly relinquished It is no
iu tification of such relinquishment to say—if it can be said of all
the Colonies—that the extreme power given has been worthily
used. Upon that worthy use, of course, the parent country
is now dependent, for what is given cannot be taken back.
Shakespeare, when he wrote King Lear, might, perhaps have
had in mind a possible parable of a Mother-country and her
The active vigour which constitutional government has un-
doubtedly imported to the British dependencies enjoying it must
arouse the consideration of the question, Can nothing be done to
constitutionalise the government of India? The share which a
native race may be induced to take in the government also suggests
that the native races of India might with advantage be more
drawn within the general scheme of government of the country.
Every question relating to native races is of interest. When we
see what labour and the acquisition of wealth will do for a native
race, we may ask ourselves, Is the system healthy which practi-
cally requires that tropical productions should be rendeied to the
use of the denizens of temperate climes at rates which entail the
necessity of labour being supplied at the bare cost of food sufficient
to keep body and soul together ? Civilised man has abolished
slavery, but he continues to exact labour for less than the comfoits
which even the slavery system supplied. ,
The colonists in South Africa are living over again that which
has passed in New Zealand, and, it may be, sufficient heed is not
paid to the teaching of experience. There is, again, the same ci -
culty between Imperial representative and Colonial government,
arising out of the relative positions of Imperial and Colonial foicc
Whilst in the House of Commons, the Minister insists on Colonial
responsibility, the Governor in the Colony refuses to call together
the 1 local parliament, and dismisses the Ministry possessing the
confidence of the majority in that parliament. Has, I would as i,
advantage been taken of the experience which shows that to use
with benefit the successes gained by force of arms railways and
roads must be constructed, the natives induced to labour, and


taught to understand the value that labour, capital, and communi-
cation will give to their lands ?
Above all, the lesson may be learnt that a country may be
stimulated artificially, if you like to call it so, by the introduction
simultaneously of labour and capital, and that this may be done to
an almost indefinite extent. The popular refrain of the day runs
to the effect that we can fight because—
“ We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men,
We’ve got the money too.”
Would that it were generally recognised that we can colonise
because we have these great resources. New Zealand, in believing
that it could do in ten years what in ordinary course might take
more than a quarter of a century, only utilised the results of obser-
vation. Experience shows that all the ramifications of a useful
community will grow out of population hastily summoned to a
locality if labour and capital be present at the same time.
Immense populations rushed to California and to Victoria in search
of gold; they remained to develop into useful communities.
Diamonds did the same office in South Africa; oil in parts of
America. Given people, work to employ them, and capital to aid
labour, and you have the elements of a successful community. If,
instead of a precarious search for gold or diamonds, you have the
certain rewards yielded by fertile land, so much the easier is the
working of the problem. It is of the greatest importance to recog-
nise the fields for enterprise the Colonies offer, for they may be
the substitute for those countries, the excessive desire to serve
which has not, in my opinion, been beneficial to this country.
The loss of the money wasted abroad would, in some castes, pro-
bably be a lesser evil from a British point of view than that of the
results of the expenditure. I do not wish to enter on political
ground, but I presume no one will deny that this country, if it is
not involved in war with Bussia, has been very near that con-
tingency. I presume, also, it cannot be questioned that the result of
the late war will in any case devolve on this country the necessity
in future of a larger annual naval expenditure—-a very much larger
one, probably. Now, is there anyone who would deny that but
for the money lent to Bussia by British capitalists, and the
military railways constructed by British capital, that war
would not have taken place, at any rate, for a long time?
It is British gold that has armed the Continent, that has
made railways, that has facilitated wars, that has done a
great deal which is now reducing the prosperity and power of


this country relatively to others. Of course I may be tolcl that
in making foreign countries prosperous we enable them 'to become
better customers ; in the same way the man who was told to
pay his debts asked where he should borrow the money to do
so. Not only has British gold made foreign countries formid-
able to Great Britain, but the interests of the British creditors of
foreign countries is calculated to injuriously influence the foreign
policy of this country. The Egyptian and Turkish debts underlie
the chief difficulties we now have in dealing with the Eastern
question. Without laying down the doctrine that the country
should enforce payment of such debts, it is impossible to leave out
of all consideration acts of repudiation, or events or action which
might lead to repudiation. Besides, man is only human, and
given a man whose family depends on his investments in Turks
or Prussians, is it possible his patriotism can rise altogether
superior to his anxiety for the welfare of the States which
owe him all he has to live on ? Really, if there were an income-
tax of five shillings in the pound on investments in foreign loans
and railways, the burden would only represent the loss to the
country in various ways arising out of this employment of British
capital. If we spend two hundred millions in a war with Russia,
and this war is 'precipitated by our liberal loans to that Power, I
should like to know if the investment shows a balance of profit
In fact, the investors gain, the nation loses. Better that capital
should remain idle than that it should be viciously spent.
There is, of course, a wide distinction between mere trading in-
vestments and those which have for their results, if not for their
object, the giving facility to a country to organise its forces and
move its armies. This is assistance from an absurd point of view,
for it benefits the few whilst it throws a serious liability on the
taxpayers in general. Had she not obtained so much English
capital, Russia would now be like a horse with too little instead of
too much oats.
The lesson New Zealand teaches us is, that there is practically
unlimited occupation for capital in British territory. In eight
years a thousand miles of railway will have been constructed
there. More attention to our own country and less to others is what
the nation demands, and yet so much does the evil feed on itself
that those who have gained their wealth by investments abroad
are the very persons who exclaim against the Colonies as sources
of weakness. Since investments abroad have become somewhat
unpopular, there is a large flow of money to British possessions.
Commerce is really now engaged in federating the Empire, but so


little does practical statesmanship run in harness with commerce,
that when the latter arrives at the conclusion that Federation is
imperatively required, statesmanship may have made it impossible.
If I may venture to offer advice I would urge on this Institute
that the question of Federation should be taken from the region of
speculative politics and introduced to the House of Commons.
However few its friends in the House at first, they will increase
when it is perceived that its advocates are in earnest. By and by
the conviction will come that the territories of Great Britain are
sufficiently large to make nationalism a noble aspiration, and that
other nations may be left to look after their own interests. The
possessions of the Queen of England and Empress of India are
extensive enough for the exercise of unbounded humanitarianism,
for the development of the largest fiscal views, for the operation*
of the most benevolent theories. We are apt, when we incline tc f
interfere so much with foreign countries, to forget how calculations
may be upset by circumstances born of foreign laws or want ctf
laws. A common bond of union is best found in similar lavas
possessing the common basis of recognition of individual rights
and of reverence for liberty and freedom. A law-abiding, frel,
and educated people, speaking the same language and owning
loyalty to the same sovereign,' has lasting interests in commcxi,
and if the Empire break up, the fault will be due to those wfio
neglect to weld it together.
