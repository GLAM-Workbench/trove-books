Moulu was a donkey and he trod the Western hills,
UP hill and DOWN hill, tinkling as he trod;
For Moulu wore around his neck a collar sewn with
bells.
UP hill he went to the Temple of the God.
Tinkle, tinkle, went the bells
"Neath the Phoenix trees .
Tinkle . . . such a happy sound
Singing in the breeze.
In his temple Buddha sat.
Smiling and serene.
On the lacquer of his gown
Joss-flares cast their sheen.
Tinkle, tinkle, went the bells.
Moulu felt quite sure
When he heard the happy sound
Buddha smiled the more.
Moulu was a donkey and he carried many souls.
Rich men and poor men, tinkling as he trod;
And Moulu's bells rang happiest when, 'neath the
Phoenix trees.
UP hill he went to the Temple of the God.

Two wooden guardians stand beside the gate.
One fierce, one mild.
And any Chinese child
Can relate
Their story:
In his glory
A Mandarin of days long since gone by.
Rich and revered.
Lived lavishly but feared
Bandits might come to steal- and so he hired
Two Generals to guard his home. Attired
In martial splendor they stood at their posts.
The rich man's fears were stilled —
If NOT his boasts.
And then one day
The Mandarin came home and, sad to say.
He found it was a sight to make a strong man
weep
Two Generals, not on guard, but... FAST ASLEEP!
The Mandarin, with anger smouldering.
Kept face, and smiled benignly but this thing
Rankled. "What use," he thought, "to pay
Generals to guard, if they behave this way?
Two snoring Generals! Why, what USE are they?
Generals asleep!! They would be just as good
If they were made of porcelain or wood!"
No sooner thought than done! A carver came
And made two figures, who looked just the same
As the two Guardian Generals, now disgraced
And sent away. And soon they were replaced
By lacquered wooden generals, who would
Their watch for ever
SLEEP.


Geese are dyed with cochineal, possibly because they are
prettier that way, and also because pink geese are considered
lucky. They are often given as wedding presents.
The blue Peking Cart is one of the most picturesque of
all the strange vehicles seen in China.
"Fai fed" means "Hurry, hurry!"

A blue, blue cart —
A driver in blue —
And me (or p'raps you)
Standing, mouth open wide.
He's ready to start.
But what's that inside?
Clack clack . . . hiss hiss . . .
Pink body . . . pink head . . .
There's a maid to be wed.
And pink geese bring good luck.
To his mule he cries this:
"FAI FAI! TLUC TLUC TLUCI"
Goodbye, cart of blue.
Goodbye, you pink geese
Who hiss without cease.
What a colorful load!
But it fades from our view
To a speck on the road.

On that porcelain screen by the Peihai
Nine Dragons—mauve —yellow—pink—green—
Swirl and curve on a deep sea of turquoise.
They call it the Nine Dragon Screen.
In the time of great Ch'ien Lung, the Emperor,
This screen was a marvel to men;
For, though only nine Dragons were carved there*
When the Emperor came THERE WERE TEN.

oo oo oo oooooh
The pigeons of Peking were one time afraid
Of the cruel robber hawks and the falcons, who preyed
On the poor helpless birds. So men came to their aid
With a Whoo oo oo oo oo oo ooooooh.
Whoo oo oo ooooooh goes the bird on the wing,
Whoo oo oo ooooooh, Whoo oo oo ooooooh.
You've never heard such a melodious thing
As that Whoo oo oo oo oo oo ooooooh.
They step from their cages and stand quietly there
And they lift up their wings, with a soft cooing prayer:
"Please tie on our whistles, so that we may scare
Our foes with a Whoo oo oo ooooooh.
The hawks and the falcons have gone far away
From the pigeons of Peking, now fearless and gay.
Who fly on their carefree, celestial way
Whistling Whoo oo oo oo oo oo ooooooh.
Whoo oo oo ooooooh goes the bird on the wing,
Whoo oo oo ooooooh, Whoo oo oo ooooooh.
There's a note in the whistle that makes our hearts sing
In tune to that Whoo oo oo ooooooh.


This Fair was held at regular intervals at Lung Fa Szu, an
old Temple on the outskirts of Peking. It was very gay, and
amazing treasures could be bought for a few dollars Mex,
"Tadtai" (pronounced tye-tye) means "Lady," and "Cumshaw"
is "commission" or "alms."

They cry their wares
Everything

They catch your eye.
"Look, taitai. See, taitai

And silks and hats.

Watch that one
Turn somersaults!

He swims in a bowl in a Chinese court
A bowl that's as high as a man.
He has a tail that is four-in-one.
And a fin that's like a fan.
He's as red as red, or as black as black.
Or the color of amber beads.
And his great eyes goggle around the bowl
In search of the food he needs.
The goldfish we keep in our bowls at home
Are dear little dainty things—
But the Goldfish that swims in that Chinese court
Is one of the Goldfish Kings.

From far away to the Western Hills
In cold and rain and heat
The people have trudged to lay their gifts
At Buddha's feet.
Hundreds and hundreds of pairs of shoes
In ever-increasing heaps
Make a glory of color around the place
Where Buddha sleeps.
One pair was brought by an Emperor
Some pairs by men so poor
That they toiled and starved to give to him
Whom they adore.
If Buddha should wake in the Western Hills
He'd open his eyes and stare
At all those hundreds of pairs of shoes

The Chinese hove a deep love of birds. Venerable old
gentlemen take their birds lor walks. Sometimes you will see
a very poor man taking a caged bird to work, and hanging
it near him while he toils.

A bird of dreams —
Blue wings with golden tips.
Words tremble on her lips#
But die away unsaid.

Fortune-telling in ' Ihina is not regarded as an amusing pas-
time, as in Wester i countries. Most C linese business men
would not dream c : launching out on my important under-
taking without first onsulting a Wise Ma i.
A free translator of "Shang Yang Tf n" is "Luck, Health
and Wealth."


"SHANG YANG YIN."
A lucky sign! A blue and lucky day!
I Smiling, the passerby goes
The fortune-teller sits at his table in the street
Of old Shanghai.
A passerby.
Head bent in thought, looks up and sees him—
Stops and speaks
To the wise man. Aiee, this is what he seeks:
Wisdom . . . advice
So that his bowl of rice
May be replenished and his fret and care
Be scattered like dead leaves upon the air.
The wise man bows his head to his table in the street.
Now he's ready to begin.
He shakes bamboo sticks in a high red tin—
Holds out the tin in bony hands.
The merchant takes a stick . . .
holding it, stands
Irresolute . . . afraid to hear his fate.
He can no longer wait I
Is it bad luck he's chosen from the tin?
Bad Luck? No, GOOD! The signs reads
SHANG YANG YIN.

Wu Wen-Jui and his family live in the strangest way.
Not in a house, but on a junk that sails on Kowloon Bay,
And they eat on the junk.
And they meet on the junk
All their friends and relations who call;
And they cook on the junk.
And they look on the junk
As the happiest home for them all.
And they fish from the junk.
And they swish from the junk
A proud sail of sacks "FROG BRAND FLOUR,

A little boy on a camel.
Sitting between the humps;
Perched up there, peacefully smiling.
Not minding . . the . . bumps.
A little boy going to market.
His old father walks by his side;
He thinks that it's best his man-child
Should sit up there and ride.
A little boy on a camel.
An old man who strolls along;
Each wearing the blue of China,
And in each heart a song.
