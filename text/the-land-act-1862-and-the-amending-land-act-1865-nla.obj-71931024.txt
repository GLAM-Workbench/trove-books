accurately as possible the number of acres comprised
in each run and according to its class and area shall
determine how many sheep or cattle it is capable of
carrying but in arriving at such determination the
said board may nevertheless make a deduction from
the number of sheep or cattle which a run would
according to the class in which it shall be ranked be
determined to be capable of carrying in respect of
any land comprised in such run which may be of
such inferior quality that it would be ranked in a
class lower than that in which the run as a whole
is ranked or which may not be available for pastoral
purposes.
Runs may be divided by the Board in order to facilitate
the ascertainment of the amount of rent.
LXXXV. Where different parts of a run vary
materially in quality the said board may if it think
fit divide such run into two or more runs and shall
in such case place the same in their proper classes
and shall determine the grazing capabilities of each

shake it in such a manner as to mix the counters together.
3. The contending applicants shall then, in the presence of the land officer and of each other, proceed in the
