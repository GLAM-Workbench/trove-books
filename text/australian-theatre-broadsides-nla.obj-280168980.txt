“ I ain’t going to school any more,”
said a discouraged urchin. “Why ?”
tenderly inquired his mother. “ ’Cause
’taint any use. I can never learn to spell.
The teacher keeps changing the words
every day.”
Jones has come into Brown's, and is
looking about the walls. Suddenly he
pauses before a sketch. “ I say, Harry,”
he says, “where did you get that?”
“ Why, I got it out of my head.” “ Well,
it’s lucky for your head that you got it
out.”

“ The steam-pipes in our school.”
To be in a “ brown study ” is said to
be a corruption of brow study, a study
requiring much thought and contraction
of the brows.
The English railways were first largely
modelled upon the old stage-coach sys-
tem. The “coaches ” were at the begin-
ning fac-similes of the stage ones, and the
guards wore red coats, like their prede-
cessors. One line engaged a band to
play the train out of the station, and for
a time the “ fares” were actually entered
on a way-bill.
Respect For the Law. — Mrs. M‘Bride
(entering the kitchen) —“ Bridget, didn’t
I see that policeman kiss you ?” Bridget
—“ Well, mum, sure an’ yez wouldn’t
hev me lay mesilf opin to arrist for re-
sisting an officer, mum.”
“ Grandpa, dear, we have come to wish
you many happy returns of the day ; and
mamma says, if you give us each half-a-
crown, we are not to lose ifcj on our

Vinnie —“Minnie will never marry
until she meets her ideal.” Vietta— -
“ What is her ideal ? ” Yinnie—“ A man

Boys will bo boys. A youth at Wagga Wagga
had his pock it full of gunpowder, and as he
was smoking a cigar “bumper” he saw his
mother coming, so he whipped the cigar into
his pocket. The oH Hdy can’t find enough of
Johnny for the coroner lo earn his regular fee
on. She goes around the village now, warning
all little boys never to carry gunpowder in their
pockets, but to go regularly to Sunday School,
and never he without some of Watson’s Ginger-
bread Worm Nuts if they wish to be healthy
and happy, and not to be food for worms.

A FAIRFIELD MIRACLE I
Bfr«. Bennett Tells of Iter Rescue.
Suffered untold miseiy lor 12 long: years.
Br. Williams'’ Pink Pills Cured her of Biliousness*
Indigestion. Liver Complaint, Terrible Headaches, &c.
A mARVEL&OUS RSCOVfiRIT!
“For twelve years,” said Mrs. Bennett, of Wetherill Park, near Fairfield,
N.S.W., to a reporter, “ I suffered terribly from general debility. I cannot tell you
how ill I was ; I felt so miserably low and depressed in spirits that I hardly cared
whether I lived or died.
“Sometimes when I saw visitors coming up towards our house, I got out of the
way, for I felt so run down that I positively couldn’t speak to them. At nights I
slept very badly. I had the most terrible headaches, and about five years ago I was
attacked with liver complaint, and was continually being laid up with fearful fits of
biliousness. I couldn’t look at food, and I suffered from excessive and obstinate
costiveness. Doctors attended me, but they failed to do anything for me, though I
paid one gentleman £3O. Severe indiges-
tion and sickness also attacked me. In
addition to doctors’ physic, I tried scores
of different medicines, and all uselessly.
One day a little book containing accounts
of cures by Dr. Williams’ Piuk Pills for
Pale People was left at our house. I was
struck by the truthfulness of the cases /£,
reported ; I sent for a trial box. I found
they did me a considerable amount of good ; I
I got more and followed the directions
exactly. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills acted
splendidly. My troublesome costiveness
disappeared, my appetite returned, my
indigestion gradually went, and so did my
liver complaint, and those severe fits of
biliousness and sick headache; I grew fat
and well, and could eat grandly. Four
boxes entirely cured me. It is some months since then, and I have now no disorders.
lam positive that Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have given me a new lease of life. My
husband was troubled with severe headaches, and three boxes entirely cured him.”

It is calculated that the aggregat

United Kingdom is about £300,000,000.
Dn Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby,”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Uncle Silas (in art gallery) : “ Giminy
crockets, Maria, but them artists is old
fellers ! ” Aunt Maria : “ How do you
know?” Uncle Silas: “Why, look at
that air picter. It’s signed 1 Jones, ’97.’”
“This is an insult,” declared the
prisoner in the police court. “ What do
you mean, sir,” roared the magistrate.
“ I’m a professional cyclist, holding
several long-distance records, your honor,
and here I’m charged with scorching at

A calculator has summed up that Eu-
rope has expended £5,200,000,000 during
the past twenty-five years for the osten-
sible purpose of maintaining peace- He
has also examined the account of the
money that has been expended in great
wars for the same period, and has dis-
covered that the sum total is far exceeded
by that which has been expended in the
cause of peace.
“ Knocked into a cocked hat ” is
symbolical of the ease with which this
article, especially when old, assumes
almost any shape.
Teacher—•“ Where do the Arabs live f M
Boy—“ In the desert.” Teacher— *• What
do they call those pious men who flee to
the desert ? ” Boy—“ Deserters.”
Scribbler—“Tes, I have written a large
number of poems, but I do not propone
having them published until after my
death.” Chorus of friends (raising their
glasses) —-“Here’s long life to you,
Scribbler.”
Her Mother—“ Edith, don’t yon think
you are getting too old to play with little
boys?” Edith (aged seven) —“No,
mamma; the older I get the better I like
them.”
“ Do you hear that whining in the next
room ? ” “ Yes ; who is it ? ” “ That’s
the football rusher who got. off those

his wife is rubbing his lame shoulder.”
A man recently drank a pint of yeast
in mistake for buttermilk. He rose three
hours earlier than usual next morning.
He —“ Just think of it. They say
man descended from a monkey.” She—
“|A come down, indeed.”
At the Party.— Mr. Boresley (amateur
hypnotist)—“Now, Miss Spicer, I want
you for a moment to concentrate your
mind upon absolutely nothing.” Miss
Spicer—“Would it make much difference
if I concentrated it upon you, Mr.
Boresley ? ” •
Encouragement.—Her Papa —“Has
my daughter given you any encourage-
ment, sir 1 ” Mr. Loveday —“Well—er
—yes. She said you ware an awfully
generous parent.”
Boy or Girl ? —Wife (reading a letter
from a distant friend) —“ How strange
Elfrida doesn’t say whether her baby is
a boy or girl. But she states it’s already
beginning to talk.” Husband—“ Oh,
well, fiaat decides it; it’s a girl, of course.”
Culture is dangerous when ifc reaches
the point of taking a woman’s mind off
the thing she has in the oven.
Lost Child (to policeman)—“ Please,
sir, have you seen a man without a little
boy ? ’Cause if you have, I’a that littl
boy.”
Fishmonger (to thrifty housewife) —
“ Fish is dear, mum. Hit’s a-gettin’ worry

An impecunious Irishman said he liked
being asked out to dinner because it was

A country clergyman recently officiated
for a brother clergyman. Being anxious
to know what impression he had made
he asked the clerk : “Was my discourse
too long p ” “No ; but it was long
enough.” “I am glad of that; for to
tell you the truth, the other day, as I
was getting this sermon ready, my dog
destroyed four or five pages, and, clerk,
that made it much shorter.” “ Oh, sir,”
said the clerk, “ could you let our vicar
have a pup o’ that ’ere dog ? ” ’
Reserved. — Lawyer — “ I must know
the whole truth before I can successfully

thing ? ” Prisoner—“ Except where I
hid the money. I want that for myself.”
The poet enters timidly. “ Hero are

Truthful Tommy.— Mr. Oumso — “This
is a y;ery bad report to bring me from

and I wanted to save your money.”
Family friend; “ I congratulate you,
my dear sir, on the marriage of your

IMPORTANT TO LADIES.
Medical men and scientists just now are
concerning themselves much about the health
of women and growing girls, and there cannot
be any doubt a vast amount of good has been
done in awakening a general interest in the
subject. The great truth has been forced gie
all concerned, that our race cannot progress
unless our women folks are sound, healthy and
strong. All writers agree that most of the
reform required for women lies in the question
of dress, and of all articles of attire required
the Corset is believed to be the most important.
Many medical men are of the opinion that
the Corset either builds up or interferes with
the health of women. Science has come direct
to the relief of women on this essential of dress,
the outcome of which is the French P.D.
Corset
These Corsets are a scientific perfection.
They not only give an elegant shape to the form
by holding it well together, but, being so flexible,
they conform to every movement of the figure,
thus giving support and the truest sense of
comfort and ease. By wearing a French P.D.
Corset a lady no longer feels cramped within or
without, the free circulation of the blood is not
impeded nor the figure distorted.
It la tbs ambition of every young man to
tUtsrry, but the cost of furnishing stops him.

man : I won’t worry you with useless
questions. I want to marry your daugh-

hand out, he added, “ And there are four
reasons which will, I hope, influence your
consent.” He then ticked them off on
each finger : “ (1) I love her. (2) I can
support her in the position she has been
used to. (o) She loves me. (4) We
both are perfectly sure that you will con-
sent.” I said, “ Yes.”
