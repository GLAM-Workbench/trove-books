I CURE DISEASE
PRONOUNCED INCURABLE
but you must come to me for Treatment.
I am treating patients from all
over New Zealand by my system of
Healing—the system that is used
in place of doctor’s drugging by
millions of people throughout the
world.
Most of my patients are those
that the medical profession has
been unable to _ cure. Paralysis,
Goitre, Insomnia, Neurasthenia,
Kidney, Stomach and Heart
Troubles, yield readily to my treat-
ment ; in fact, there are no diseases
that I cannot alleviate, and very
few indeed that I cannot cure.
My message to all the ailing is:
“ Don’t despair.” You may have
spent hundreds of pounds trying to
get cured—-and still are sick. Well,
every week I discharge patients—
usually after a few weeks’ treat-
ment—perfectly well and cured,
who have had just the same experi-
ence as you.
And my treatment cures perma-
nently, because it cures the causes
of disease, and does not merely
tinker with symptoms.
Write to me about your case.
You will have to come to Auckland
for treatment —but isn’t that
worth while, when you can surely
be cured?
I have a little booklet explain-
ing the principles ot Psychic Heal-
ing and Suggestive Therapeutics—
shall I send you a free copy?

RATANA


CHAPTER I
The Finding of the Power.
TF you had wandered through the
Wanganui district a couple of
years ago, you might have come
upon a pleasant little homestead,
set in the midst of a farm. And if
you had asked a neighbour to whom
it belonged, the neighbour would
have said: “It is the home of Ra-
tana, a Maori farmer.” So you
would have gone on your way un-
mindful of the fact that Ratana,
unknown beyond his neighboxiring
acres, would come before New Zea-
land’s million as the greatest spiri-
tual power that has ever moved the
Maori people.
If you had opened the gate in
front of that homestead and walked
up to it, you would have found the
wife of Ratana and a family of
bright, healthy youngsters; all
forming a happy, quiet family. But
one day a cloud came over the
home; a cloud that was later to
disappear and reveal sunshine of
unsuspected wonder. The cloud
came when one of the tiny Ratana
children ran a needle into its body
while playing on the floor. The
father took the child to a doctor,
but the needle could not be lo-
cated. Then Ratana went home, a
sad and despairing man. But he
was a man of great spiritual faith;
a man who believed in the power
of prayer and he took his trouble
to God. For six days this Maori
farmer prayed and fasted and then
the miracle happened! The needle
came out of the child’s knee.
Thus in this quiet little corner of
the open counti'y, with no witness-
es save his own folk and the silent
trees and rolling meadows, Ratana,
the Maori miracle man gained his
first knowledge of his power. And
that little incident was the curtain-
raiser to the great cures for which
Ratana and his faith are responsi-
The news of Ratana’s gift spread,


and he was called on to extend his
power beyond his own hearth. All
the Maori people of the island heard
of him and gradually Ratana was
prevailed upon to make his present
tour among the Maori peoples.
How S Went Before Ratana.
(We open our story of this won-
der man by recording the impres-
sion of an educated Maori who went
before him, so that in reading the
story of his cures our readers will
be able to understand just hew the
sufferers are taken before him and
how he deals with them.—Editor).
“You ask me what made me go
before Ratana?” The Maori lad,
one time an officer with our troops
and a graduate from one of our
colleges, told us the story in perfect
English.
“I went because I saw the after
influence of his work among the
Te Kuiti Maoris. They have come
to a period of religious faith and
high morality that they have never
known before because of Ratana.
A church ie being built in Te Kuiti
on the ground where Tohungaism
was once preached. It is this that
has made me have faith in Ratana.’ 5
“Tell me how you met him,” the
story writer asked.
“I went to Auckland when he
went there from the East Coast,
and with other natives, I went to
the Maori Hostel. My hip was in-
jured in the war and I have never
been right with it since, although
the best of the military doctors have
attended to it. So I decided to give
this faith doctor a try and I went
before him in Auckland.
“The first thing that impressed
me about Ratana was his lack of
show and his simplicity of speech
and method.
“What is your name,” he asked
me. I told him.
“What is your trouble?” he then
questioned. I explained how my hip
had been injured and that I was
unable to sleep on my deft side be-
cause of it. As I told him, Ratana
looked at me with those piercing
eyes which are his one distinctive
feature. They are dark, penetrat-
ing eyes which seem to have caught
the spiritual penetration of which
his mind is capable.
“Do you believe in God,” he
asked me.
I said “yes.”
“Do you believe that there is
only one God and that the old,
many Gods of the Maori people are
false? Do yon believe that if your
faith is strong enough, you will
be cured?”
I answered him and then he said:
“Well, believe and have faith, and
by to-night yonr trouble will end.
Without gesture or sign he told me
this and then I walked away, sign-
ing my name in a book as I went
out. In this hook Ratana keeps
the signatures of all the people who
go to him .
“I went away from Ratana feel-
4
RATANA


ing in one way disappointed. I had
expected an atmosphere of mysti-
cism and there was none. I expect-
ed a deeply impressive talk and
there wag none. He was the most
normal, unassuming, quiet person
you could imagine and there was
nothing dramatic or impressive
about him. That night I went to
bed as usual and was surprised to
find that I could lie on my left,
side, without any pain. And I
have lain on it ever since.”
Thus one Maori tells of his go-
ing before Ratana.
Half An Hour With Ratana
It was early morning when I first
saw Ratana. He was stepping off
the steamer, and the wharf was
crowded with people who were wait-
ing to see him. There were news-
paper reporters and photographers,
but they were all defeated for
Ratana will not be interviewed or
photographed. He hurriedly disap-
peared into a motor oar. During
the many months that Ratana has
been before the public eye, h© has
not been interviewed by a press-
man, and in a country like this,
where the newspaper men are gen-
erally very astute, it shows that
the Maori Miracle Man is intent
upon keeping away from the lime-
light of personalities about himself.
He is content to be seen by the'
public only over the heads of his
secretaries and through the medium
of the people he cures.
The two things yon must
know about Ratana are first, that
he is a devout Christian, and sec-
ond that he is not a showman. He
shares almost the same views as
the Rev. Nibloek in some ways, be-
lieving that faith in God can cure
as it did in the age of miracles.
If you want a mental picture of
Ratana, imagine a middle-aged
Maori, tall, slight of build, clean-
shaved, walking with a slight stoop
and wearing a felt hat and long
coat. Imagine rather a thin face,
fair for a Maori and illuminated by
black, piercing eyes that look
through you. They are like slum-
bering powers. Ratana docs not use
his eyes as a hypnotist does and
yet one feels that he has the power
to do so. They are quiet and won-
derfully impressive, and they add
a mystic, spiritual atmosphere to
his face. An old woman who knew
the early Maori priests told me
that Ratana’s expression was very
similar to theirs. But Ratana- does
not ally himself with the old Gods
of the Maoris. He is an eminently
devout Christian and he is proving
to be a great inspiration to the
spiritual life of the natives as well
as a healer.
When I saw Ratana, h© was
making for a great meetinghouse
where hundred® of the sick and
lame of his kinsmen were gather-
ed. He moved quickly in entering
the place and seemed to be very
business-like. He sat down behind
a long table with his secretaries
near him. His entourage is great-
er than that of the Prince of
Wales. First of all he signed a
1
RATANA


couple of hundred letters, and this
work took him some time. I found
out that these letters are in a set
form, and that they are replies to
the many requests for help that
reach him. From far away Eng-
land, America and Australia, white
people are writing to him for help.
He urges them to faith and a re-
ligious life and tells them that cure
lies in these things. When he had
signed the letters, Ratana set
about interviewing the enormous
crowd of Maoris waiting for him.
The first one came. He was a
young man with something wrong
with his leg. He was questioned as
to his faith and he passed away
within a minute with the assurance
that he would, be cured. There was
something very pathetic about the
gathering. Little children with
pinched, unhealthy faces, old women
with the marks of age upon them
and one tragic figure possessed of
a devil waited for the great man’s
healing power. They passed before
him one by one and went out,
signing their names in the book
when their little interview was
ended. During this long pro-
gramme, Ratana sat very quietly,
never raising his voice or obviously
making a gesture. His voice is
quiet and cultured just as his Eng-
lish is faultless. He spoke to some
of the Maoris in Maori and to some
in English.
The dramatic element in Ratana’s
cures does not lie with the curer
but with the cured. Ratana sits
quietly at his table, unmoved and
unmoving. He looks and speaks
when a patient comes to him but
he does not raise his voice. The
dramatic atmosphere is maintained
by the sick folk who come to him.
The first time I saw him was in a
Maori village where there was an
absolute line of people waiting.
Some were old women who seem-
ed on the verge of their grave.
Some were mere lads, probably in-
jured in the war, and others were
dusky natives with crutches or
sticks, obviously in need of the
help Ratana was able to give
them. The long line moved up to
him, as he sat at a table and each
person wns quietly dealt with. Once
a [young Maori threw, away his
crutches a few" minutes after he left
the great healer and he w r alked
away without them; for the first
time in years, so he told us. From
the scene of the farm, Ratana’s life
story moves to the journey
through the North Island; the
journey of healing.
The Coming of Fame.
It vras as recent as November last
that Tahu William (Wiremu) Ra-
tana attracted outside attention to
any great degree. His first miracles
w r ere performed at the little village
where he lived, between Turakina
and Wangaehu, outside Wanganui.
The name of this Maori settlement
is Ratana, the name which the na-
tive healer claims as his own. The
Maoris were, of course, the first to
tell the news of his w r ork and this
spread to Hawkes Bay and the King
Country. Train loads of Maoris
6
RATANA


travelled from Te Kuiti and the
surrounding district to Wanganui,
where they interviewed Katana.
The first outside cure recorded at
the time was that of an old Maori
from Te Kuiti who went to Wan-
ganui with crutches and returned
with no aid but that of a walking-
stick. We heard a description of
his return from a Maori who lives
in the kaianga near Te Kuiti. The
old man was a well-known figure in
the settlement but he had always
used crutches. He went by the
train to Wanganui and returned a
few days later without his. crutches.
He was able to walk briskly down
the street with nothing but his
walking-stick to help him. Te
Kuiti Maoris were astonished and
their interest was at burning point.
Following this cure, hundreds of
the natives travelled to Ratana and
passengers by the Main Trunk and
other trains were astounded to find
an absolute pilgrimage set up. Spec-
ial carriages were reserved for the
pilgrims. But they were very
silent about Ratana and there was
an atmosphere of secrecy and mysti-
cism about him. European people
then took an interest in the healer
and the newspapers made him the
news hero of many an article. Even
the stolid Railway Department was
disturbed and a special flag station
was instituted near Ratana’s camp
so that the Maoris could visit him
without too much trouble.
The Great Moment.
Ratana’s great moment came at
Christmas. He had built a church
near his home at Katana, most-
ly with his own money, and this
was to be opened at Christmas. It
is hard for ns in the cities to realise
what a sensation was caused at this
great gathering. Over three thou-
sand Maoris travelled to the little
township and they travelled from
every part of New Zealand. They
came from the far gum lands of the
North, from the rolling Wairarapa
plains, the East Coast and the
West. They gathered around Ba-
tana to be within his power and to
celebrate the opening of his Church.
It was probably the most wonderful
religious gathering ever held here.
A year before Ratana was quietly
farming his land. Now he was the
miracle man, the inspired, the
powerful spiritual king of the
Maori people. The old-time enthus-
iasm and vigour of the Maoris, the
old-time pride of race and mystic
atmosphere which had been partly
killed by the advance of civilisa-
tion, were fanned to new flame and
the Maori population of New Zea-
land was thrilled as it has never
been thrilled before. Tohungaism
was forgotten. The old, feeble creeds
of the Maori were thrown aside and
this champion of the European and
Christian God was respected, al-
most worshipped because of his
message and the healing power
which accompanied it. Imagine the
wonder of that gathering! Three
thousand Maoris living on an area
of ground previously quiet and
peaceful; a silent farm land. Now
it was a momentarily densely popn-
7
RATANA


lated town. Hundreds of bullocks,
thousands of sheep and dried sharks,
and 20,000 gallons of water were
among the things transported to
that lonely little farm for the
Christmas festival. The trains simply
poured forth Maoris when they
stopped at the siding, and in a few
days a colony of tents and huts was
built and inhabited. Electricity was
installed and in every way Ratana’s
religions camp was fitted for the
work it was called upon to do.
Above all this organisation, this
crowding and interest, stood the
romantic figure of Ratana, the mir-
acle man. He was dark and silent
and he looked on quietly, giving an
instruction when it was necessary
and always being obeyed. His power
was absolute.
Describing the scene of that
great church opening, a Wanganui
writer has said:
“I looked at it from afar. It was
like a scene out of some barbarian
age except that the tents were very
modern and the presence of electric
light spoiled the ancient air of the
place. Thousands of Maoris were
running about and they were shout-
ing. There were great marques and
smaller tents and Ratana’s home
swarming with natives. There was
the smell of food cooking and the
bustle made me think of some an-
cient army preparing for a change
of camp. It was early morning when
I arrived at Ratana’s place but the
three or four thousand Maoris were
all astir and excitedly talking about
the great event of the day; the
opening of Ratana’s church.
“Then from a house, a Maori
slowly advanced towards me. He
was the quiet, powerfully silent fig-
ure I expected. It was Katana. And
what a greeting his people gave
him! There was nothing of the mes-
meric healer about him. He was
like a dusky, gentle priest walking
among them. Some of these Maoris
had been crippled and some had
been almost blind before they came
to him. For a moment my mind
rested on the story of the Great
Healer; He whose power is suppos-
ed to inspire Ratana in the great
work which be is accomplishing.”
One of the few people who have
chatted with Ratana has said;
“Ratana denies the impeachment
that he is a prophet. He says he is
of the Presbyterian faith and that
he is merely the instrument of
God.”
Men From the North.
The writer of this story met a
number of Ratana’s “patients” in
Auckland last January. They were
from the North and they had been
down to Ratana’s home. They had
travelled from as far north as the
Bay of Islands so that the fait;-
behind their desire to see Ratana
was not lessened by travelling d:
culties or distance.
I take two of the cases from this
party as representative of two ex-
tremes, showing that Ratana’s in-
fluence is not confined to the excit-
able old Maori of the old regime
8
RATANA


but that he is also a power as far
as the sophisticated, civilised Maori
of to-day is concerned. The old
man, coming from the North, spent
a little time in Auckland on the
way to his home again. He arrived
in Auckland very enthusiastic about
Ratana, and the writer located him
in a Victoria Street boardinghouse.
It was a small, tidy room that the
reporter entered. On the bed was
lying an old Maori man, a Maori
of the old days before the natives
fell to the charm of extreme civili-
sation, His early life had been col-
oured by the romance of true native
environment. And this was his story.
He lived away north. For twenty
years, dating from about the time
of the Duke of York’s visit, the old
man had suffered very badly with
rheumatism. First one leg, then
the other became crippled by the
pain and stiffness of rheumatism.
Gradually he became helpless and
even crutches were useless to him.
Among the Maoris with whom he
lived he was looked upon as an un-
fortunate old man, helpless and un-
happy because of his terrible pain.
Then the story of Ratana was told
to him. He decided to travel south
to Wanganui and see the great man
and one day, on the crowded Auck-
land railway station, this old man
was almost lifted into the Main
Trunk train which carried him
South. Then he approached the
home of Ratana.
The Maori miracle man talked
to him about the fallacy of the old-
time Maori religion and the need
for faith in the Christian God. “And
if you believe in Him and Him only,
and if your faith and your life are
inspired by that belief, you will be
healed,” said Ratana. Then the
healer told him to walk without the
crutches, and with great difficulty
the old man hobbled a few steps. A
relative, standing near Ratana, ran
forward to help the old Maori bnt
Ratana stopped him and told the
aged cripple to walk alone. This he
did and within a couple of days he
was able to leave Ratana’s house
and board the train for Auckland.
But he was not the same man! His
crutches were unnecessary and he
was able to step on to the train
unaided. And thus, within a few
days, this ancient old warrior ar-
rived back in Auckland on the way
north, younger in spirit, and strong-
er in body, and stronger in faith.
It was the rejuvenated Maori that
the reporter met in the Victoria
Street boardinghouse. He jumped
from the bed when the reporter
entered the room. He was eager
to tell his story and he told it.
He opened and shut his hands, he
walked about the room and he in-
sisted on shaking hands with the
writer to show him just how real
everything was.
A Younger Mart.
Perhaps you will think that from
the last story Ratana can wield his
power over the old Maori who is
still a part of the old-time mystic
Maori faith and that it is merely
a racial fanaticism. Then take the
9
RATANA


case of a young Maori lad, a re-
turned soldier who has tasted the
charm of London life and the haz-
ards of trench warfare. Imagine
him .as a Maori only in colour and
a European in every inch of his
training. The Maori in question
was educated at a State school
and then at an Auckland
college. The writer knew him
for many years in Auckland and
knows that he is very little a
Maori as far as mental develop-
ment is concerned. His life has not
been in touch with Maori customs
and he is almost a stranger to his
native people. He was away on
service for some years and he is
a cultured, educated man, able to
speak beautiful English. He suffer-
ed a wound while away with the
forces and he has been unhappy
with the pain and diiscomfort of
this for some time.
He was in Auckland some time
ago when he met a Maori who had
been cured by Ratana. He told
me, this Maori lad, that he lis-
tened to the old man’s story with
a certain amount of diffidence and
that when they parted, he thought
nothing more about it. An uncle
of his, a wealthy, educated man,
next brought the name of Ratana
before him and mentioned the pos-
sibility of his being cured by his
miraculous power. But my young
friend was away from the run of
things by then and he didn’t
bother. Then he heard that Ka-
tana was coming to Auckland and
he became suddenly possessed -with
desire to try his power. So he
travelled here and the story from
then is the same as the story of
Katana’s other cures. The young
soldier, injured in war, was cured
of his pain a few hours after speak-
ing to the great man. My readers
must see in this that it is no ex-
citable, dramatic atmosphere wllic i
possibly attracts the old Maoris.
Katana’s power is such that it con-
vinces the sceptical youth of to-
day as much as the old Maori who
lived in an age when medicine men
and tohungaism were the order of
the Maori pahs.
The fifteen Maoris who went to
Katana from the North, passed
through Auckland early in Jan-
uary last. By that time Katana’s
fame had spread and he was being
visited by hundreds of natives
every week. All these fifteen men
returned to their homes obviously
cured of their disabilities. One I
talked to had been severely injured
by a fall into a fire. He lost por-
tions of his fingers of the right
hand, and he suffered partial par-
alysis of the left arm and leg. For
the loss of the fingers Katana
could, of course, do nothing, but
he partially cured the paralysis
with a promise that it would even-
tually be entirely cured. This man
left his crutches with Katana and
he told me that in the Maori heal-
er’s home there was a large heap
of crutches left there by the men
who had been cured and who had
no further use for them.
The Progress of Ratana.
Last year Ratana wag not known
beyond his immediate circle and
10
EATANA


when the Wanganui newspaper
wrote of him on about Novein m
19 they referred to him as a
“Maori named Tan William Ka-
tana. ” They spoke of him as al-
most a stranger to the newspaper
columns. Now the name Ratana
is known to every person in New
Zealand, and people who read the
papers all over the English-speak-
ing world'.
Novembers 1920.
In November of 1920,, the quiet
pilgrimage of Maoris was well es-
tablished. Ratana had not rushed
into print and he had excluded the
white man from his entourage and
even his pah, so that his work had
not been attended by much pub-
licity. On November, 18, a party
of Maoris passed through Wan-
ganui on the way back to their
homes in Hawke’s Bay and the
King Country and they were very
enthusiastic and happy over the re-
gained strength which they claim-
ed.
King Country Maoris.
On November 20, it was announc-
ed in Te Kuiti that over 1000
Maoris had left the King Country
to visit Ratana. They did not
claim him as a tohunga as he re-
ceived no payment. This fact must
be recorded. Ratana receives no fee
at all and even his church has been
built, in the main, from his own
money. On November 20, Te Kuiti
was greatly excited by the Maori
exodus. A thousand Maoris soon
spread a story and the tales of Ra-
tana’s power were the only topic of
conversation in the King Country
town. In Te Kuiti, perhaps more
than in any town the permanence
of Ratana’s influence is being felt.
Tohungaism previously obtaining a
great hold on the natives died a
sudden death as the result of Ra-
tana’s power. The Maoris saw that
Ratana’s belief in Christianity was
the inspiration of his healing power
and this practical evidence convinc-
ed them that their old pagan faith
in tohungaism was useless. So they
ignored the old practices and built
a church. In this church the na-
tives are worshipping to-day as they
did when they returned from Ra-
tana’g home nine months ago. Nine
months have not dimmed their fer-
vour.
His Last Interview.
Although Ratana has travelled
and lived so secretly during the
past months, in, the early part of
his career as a healer, he was in-
terviewed on a few occasions. On
December 6, Ratana was question-
ed as to the few isolated cases
where his cures were not effective.
In reply he said that he admitted
that some of his previous cases had
relapses, but added that it was due
to lack of faith. The natives whose
cures had failed had been talking
with the unbelieving pakeha and
from that had doubted the power
of God. They doubted and went
back to th© old Maori beliefs in
Tohungaism and Makutu. When
Maoris did that, there was no hope.
“I am trying,” said Ratana, “to
make them believe in God and the
Holy Ghost.”
11
RATANA


This was the last occasion on
which the newspapers were able to
gain any verbatim statement from
Ratana who, in these days, makes
his statement only through his sec-
retary.
December, 1920.
In December, of 1920, came the
great Christmas gathering of which
we have already written. It was
a stupendous thing, organised
quietly and almost secretly, for
even on the 2nd of December the
newspapers spoke of the Christmas
gathering as being merely rumour-
ed. But it was no myth.
White people who viewed the
gathering from a distance w r ere as-
tonished at the scene. In a few
days, the quiet little farm was
turned into -a native camp with
hundreds of tents, thousands of
Maoris, and in the centre, Ratana’s
home and the new church which
was opened as a Christmas thanks-
giving. The cures effected during
that time are too many for record.
Every hour, every minute almost,
some unfortunate native would
waylay Ratana and pray for
health. There was always the, same
quiet question: “Do you believe in
God?’ 5 Then the answ'er, “Yes.”
Then the inevitable result—a sick
man cured and able to join with
the others to voice the wonder ef
the man of miracles.

CHAPTER 11.
Ratana Interviewed.
Ratana has steadily refused to
meet newspaper reporters or pose
for photographers. Although lie
has appeared on numerous railway
stations he has always evaded the
camera, and his secretary keeps the
venturesome newspaper reporter at
a distance. But in the early stages
of his miracle work, he was ap-
proached by one man and that was
in Wanganni on the evening of
November 18. The result of this
chat, expected to be a trifle sensa-
tional, was of the utmost simplic-
ity. Ratana, who had euiTounded
himself with an air of secrecy,
merely said that he was not a pro-
phet but that he was a quiet Presby-
terian who had lived in the little
Maori township of Ratana for thirty
years. He was spiritually inclined
and some twelve months before, he
had found himself possessed of power
to heal the sick a power which came
to him after long and close commun-
ion with God. Since then he had
been the instrument, in God’s hands,
of curing hundreds of Maoris of ail-
ments and afflictions, some of which
were of long standing and believed
to be incurable. He was very pleased
to be used in curing the sick and
to give them a chance to enjoy life.
It was a very modest statement
for a man who had been the centre
of the biggest religions pilgrimage
ever known here. His greatness was
associated with extreme simplicity.

CHAPTER 111.
Maori Council’s Approval
The next step in Ratana’s car-
eer cam© towards the end of De-
cember, about Christmas time,
when* the Maori Council held a
meeting and unanimously decided
to support the suggestion of Tahu
Ratana, and appeal to all the tribes
to abandon Tohungaism for the
true God, and to ask Parliament
to legislate so that the preaching
of the doctrine of tohungaism might
be a punishable offence.
It was a strong victory for the
Maori healer to gain the approval
of the Maori Council, a strong
body, usually very fearless in its
decisions. It gave him a great
deal more prestige with his own
people.
January,
The month of January saw a
great spreading of Ratana’s power.
In addition to attracting those in
his own territory, he drew Maoris
from the farthest gum lauds of the
North. Numbers of these old peo-
ple had to sell some of their pos-
sessions to pay the steamer and
railway fares to reach the healer.
But their faith stood this financial
test. Thus in Auckland, where
Ratana had so far been merely a
person of the newspapers and table
talk, we suddenly saw bis people
walking through our streets. One
morning, we suddenly realised the
wonder of the man by seeing Maoris
stream into Queen Street with
stories of how, when they went
mystic power had ridded them of
through the city two weeks before,
they had to be helped on to the
train. Now they were cured. His
their ailments. It all seemed very
wonderful. It made the man in
the street think and it made the
churchman think.
Here was a simple Maori, pre-
viously unknown, not wanting the
publicity which was already coming
to him. He suddenly rose from his
quiet and obscurity and hovered
over the Maori people like a super-
human being, a miracle worker, a
divinely inspired man who was to
lead his people from their pagan
faiths and their indifference to
Christianity. Not only was he to
lead them, but he was to cure
them and heal them. His word
was to restore health and vigour;
his presence was to make the lame
walk and the blind see. And about
him there gathered multitudes of
people. They implored him to help
them and he did. Thug, in this
very Queen Street, the home of
barter and money-making, we saw
these healed men walk just as their
brothers of another age walked al-
most two centuries ago. It took
us back to Bible days and made us
realise that in our midst had risen
a man who possessed power to move
a race of people; a man who was
to be the greatest spiritual and re-
ligious influence that hag ever
worked among the Maoris.
Northern Maoris.
During this month of January,
an enormous number of Northern
Maoris visited Ratana. All who
14
RATANA


went to him received instruction of
the same kind. They were told to
keep on working the injured limb
until freedom of movement was
gained. They were promised a
cure if they persevered. At the
same time they were instructed to
repeat certain passages of Scrip-
ture. As a result of Ratana’s
ministrations it was stated that
there was at his home near TV an-
garnii, a growing pile of crutches.
Ratana insisted that the man who
approached him on crutches must
leave them behind, and therefore,
if you went to his home, you would
find an immense heap of crutches,
left there by rejoicing pilgrims.
In the same way, he has a great
heap of spectacles left by people
whose sight has been aided or re-
stored. Members of the party
which came through Auckland,
told ns how an elderly patient, on
leaving, started to walk from a
motor ear to the railway station
at Marton Junction, where he join-
ed the Main Trunk train. He cov-
ered part of the distance, and then,
Ratana, seeing that he was tired,
sent ahead for a luggage truck on
which the remainder of the jour-
ney to the train was made.
A Doctor’s Views.
Ratana had gained the approval
of the Maoris and the interest of
the Europeans. But he was curing
people of ailments that were pre-
viously taken to the doctor, and it
was very interesting, therefore, to
read the report of Dr. Elliott’s ad-
dress given in Wellington. The
■Wellington papers, describing the
lecture given by Dr. I. S'. Elliott,
said; ‘‘Quacks and Quackery, and
the credulity of the human mind”
was the title of a lecture delivered
here by Dr. I. S. Elliott under the
auspices of the Red Gross Society.
The lecturer, referring to faith-
healing, said faith played a most
important part in healing. There
was nothing new to medical men
about that. He believed in the
efficacy of prayer; he believed that
it gave people peace and calmness
that was conducive to their heal-
ing ; but to tell him that all other
proved means of healing were to
he neglected was the height of ab-
surdity. Ratana, the Maori faith
healer, was subsequently mentioned
by the speaker. Dr. Elliott re-
marked: ‘That comes under the
heading of ‘faith healing.’ We ad-
mit the value of faith healing for
certain functional conditions. Re-
gular medical practitioners know
the value of faith. We resort to
it. We often have cases where
people have been in great pain, and
they believe they have been given
hypodermic injections of morphia,
hut they are sometimes given dis-
tilled water instead of morphia.
But they think it is morphia, and
go to sleep. They are made to
sleep on faith. There has been
faith healing in all religions.” In
this way the medical profession
opened its eyes to the fact of Ra-
tana’s power.
A Cure By Letter.
We have told the story of the
cure of Maori pilgrims who went to
15
RATANA


Ratana’s home, but when these were
voiced abroad, there came a still
more surprising aspect of Ratana’s
power. He was besieged with let-
ters from all parts of the world.
People in America, Australia, and
as far away as England wrote to
him and asked for help. One of
the first successes from these let-
ter writers happened in Invercar-
gill. Mrs, Jackson, wife of the
postmaster at Edendale, Southland,
had a tubercular spin© and she went
through periods of terrible agony.
Doctors were unable to do • any-
thing for her and her case was an
absolute tragedy. At last her doc-
tor told her folk that she was past
aid and the unfortunate woman
had to lie in bed. in terrible pain
and very weak. In July of last
year, Mrs. Jackson read about Ra-
tana. She wrote to him and he
replied to her letter, telling her to
have absolute faith in God. The
great man told her to pray for
strength and he promised to pray
for her. He also sent her the sixth
chapter of Matthew, verse 24, as
a text; “Ho man can serve two
masters; for either he will hate the
one and love the other, or else he
will hold to the one and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God
and mammon.”
Imagine the scene of this woman’s
tragedy! Living in pleasant com-
fort with her people, she had been
suddenly moved from active life
because of her spine trouble. She
was forced to stay in bed for
months and hang on to a life that
was haunted by ghastly pain and
the thought that it would probably
never leave her. Doctors had
shaken their heads over her case
and she was almost given up.
Then the simple note came from
Ratana. Pain had not robbed her
of her faith in God. Agony had
not shaken her belief in a super-
natural power to heal her, and
heeding the miracle man’s word,
she prayed and allowed his text to
inspire her earnest desire for
health. In her own words, Mrs.
Jackson has told the story of her
cure as follows:
“Some days later, having follow-
ed Ratana’g advice, I made an at-
tempt to get up, and had to be
canied back to bed feeling very
exhausted. On the following
Thursday, I had turned over in
bed, intending to try to sleep,
when the thought cam© to rue that
rn obeying the doctor’s instructions
to keep in bed I was really putting
him before God, so I got up, and
stood, and walked without difficulty
or feeling of weakness. Further, all
pain left me immediately, and 1
have been free of it for the first
time for ten years. I walked about
the house without difficulty, and
when my husband was telephoned
that I was up and about, he would
not believe it. To-day I am feeling
quite well, and I am secure in the
knowledge that at last I am well on
the road to permanent recovery.
There is not the suggestion of
pain, and I must confess to sur-
prise that, although I was in bed
for so long, there is no weakness
in any of my limbs. My doctor
states that the trouble is dormant,


and that nothing short of a miracle
could have worked the change, and
it is a miracle. There are times
when I feel that there is a
.strength helping me that is not my
own. Undoubtedly my cure is due
to the Great Physician. The work
that Katana is doing is such that
no one who benefits should be
afraid to admit it, for there may
be many who could be helped By
him.”
The above report of Mrs. Jack-
son’s cure is verified by her hus-
band and her married sister. It
must not be taken as an exaggerat-
ed account of this remarkable cure,
in which the patient and healer
did not meet. They were divided
by more than the length of the
South Island of New Zealand. The
latest enquiries as to Mrs. Jack-
son’s cur© show that she is improv-
ing every day and that this invalid
of a few months ago is now enjoy-
ing good health, the reward of her
faith in the Great Power.
A Secretary.
In the paper of January 26 we
read that Katana’s secretary was
being kept very busy with mail.
Thus we learned that Katana was
forming an entourage and indeed,
When he travelled away from. Wan-
ganui, his staff was greater than
that of the Prince when he was here.
Katana’s secretary, Peter Moko, is,
of course, a Maori, with great faith
in the man whose correspondence
he attends to. Katana is a great
secret. He is .never interviewed
and he is never photographed. If
you ask any of his following which
is Katana, they will each point to
a different Maori. You can’t evea
find out which is the great man.
Peter Moko, the secretary, is in
charge of the mail. He answers
the hundreds of letters coming in
from European people who want
help. But Katana signs and over-
looks the letters and they each bear
the mark of his personality in the
way of a text or a personal mes-
sage.
A Setback.
Katana has had little to inter-
fere with his career. While many
people have expressed doubt as to
his power, few have deliberately
thwarted him in his mission. But
at a Maori village near Kahukura,
on the East Coast, a native clergy-
man feared for the loyalty of his
flock and h© objected to Katana’s
visit. He probably feared that,
armed with his power as a healer,
he would possibly draw his church
people away from him. So he
strongly objected to Katana’s com-
ing and. in return Katana was an-
noyed to the extent of packing up
Iris belongings and preparing for
departure. But some of the na-
tives prevailed upon him to stay
and he gave them a few hours.
This is one of the few occasions
where he met with any opposition.
It was rather unnecessary on the
part of the Maori preacher to ob-
ject when, whatever one’s views on
healing might be, there is absol-
utely no doubt that Katana is
proving a great spiritual force
among the natives and that he is
17
KATANA


helping and not hindering them in
the Christian teachings which are
the backbone of Ratana’ 3 creed.
Recognition Abroad.
By the beginning of February
last Ratana’s name was well known
abroad. The English and Ameri-
can papers copied the newspaper
articles dealing with him and thus
his story was known in almost
every English speaking country.
Many letters flowed in to Ratana
as the result of this publicity. In
some cases the writers stated their
intention of breaking up their
homes and coming out to the Do
minion with a view to receiving
treatment. In view of Ratana’s
statement that faith only is re-
quired, and that a personal visit is
unnecessary, these people are be-
ing advised to stay where they are,
pending a communication from Ra-
tana himself. The diseases and
afflictions mentioned in the various
letters range from blindness, par-
alysis, tuberculosis, to ingrowing
toenails. All the letters make piti-
ful reading, but a marked feature
of most of them is the belief in
the power of Ratana to heal
through Divine inspiration. One
letter read, inter alia: “ I
am truly desirous of being cured,
but not by any means than through
Christ. Can you inform me if Ra-
tana is a real Christian, is truly
a Christian, and that through his
belief in the words of our Saviour
in the 14th chapter and 12th verse
of St. John he works these miracles?
If so, I believe he can cure me, but
if it is in gods of wood and stone
it is not possible to believe, and I
will have nothing to do with Ra-
tana.”
In Morrinsville
In the early part of March, Ra-
tana visited Morrinsville, and on
the 7th of that month we read the
following in a letter from a man
in Morrinsville. It shows how
complete were the arrangements
for Ratana’s reception. The letter
said: ‘ ‘Preparations are in hand for
the reception of Ratana, the Maori
“miracle” man from Wanganui. He
is coming to Morrinsville on March
23, and will stay a week or more.
Over 3000 natives are expected to
foregather to meet him. They will
come from all parts of the Auck-
land Province. Five large mar-
quees, 10 bullocks, 60 loads of fire-
wood, two tons of sugar, and an
enormous quantity of food and
other requirements for such a large
gathering have been ordered. An
Auckland firm is supplying the bulk
of the goods. Already £l5OO has
been collected to meet the expen-
diture that is involved. A commit-
tee has been set up under the
Maori Councils Act, and the rules
and regulations for governing the
gathering are of a very strict na-
ture. Special police are being pro-
vided for the meeting, which will
take place at the Maori Parlia-
ment House and enclosure, on the
outskirts of Morrinsville.”
Another Cure By Letter
March, 1921.
The story of the cure of Miss
Lammas has already been given
wide publicity, and in this com-
plete record, it is necessary only to
give her own, verbal narrative of
18
RATANA


her cure. The papers at the time,
hailed her cure as being the most
wonderful then credited to Ratana.
Miss Lammas lives in Nelson. Since
her early childhood she had been
an invalid and for nineteen years
she was the victim of contin-
ual illnesses, and for a great deal
of time she was an absolute invalid.
Now she is able to take short walks
and is enjoying the freedom and
independence of action that all the
doctors of the country could not
give her. It was during the first
days of March last that Miss Lam-
mas regained her strength, and al-
though some weeks elapsed before
the story crept into the papers, it
belongs to the March chapter of
Ratana’s miracles.
In view of the wide publicity
given to the circumstances of her
cure, it is sufficient here, as we
have already said, to record Miss
Lammas’ own story which amply
illustrates the wonder of her cure.
Nineteen Years Of Suffering.
“My case is a really remarkable
one,” Miss Lammas said. “I have
been ill since I was a little
girl. I Lad a badly dilated heart,
to begin with, and then my chest
and spine became useless. For
19 years I used a steel frame to
move about in. I had always to
wear this one when I was out of
bed. Even my head was propped
tip in iron and my shoes were
screwed to the end of the frame.
Prior to having this steel frame
I had to lie on my back for some
years. My doctor put me in the
iron so that I might get out of
bed and with the aid of this frame
I was able to walk about the house
after a fashion.
“During the past 19 years 1
have had some serious illnesses
and the doctors had given me up
time after time. In all I have had
about 30 doctors attending me. A
masseuse who treated my back for
nearly a year pronounced my case
to be hopeless. There had been no
end of consultations, and on the
very day that I wrote to Ratana,
my doctor held a consultation with
another medical man, and the re-
sult was that my case was again
declared to be hopeless.
Have You Heard of Katana?”
“when the doctor said that there
was no hope,” continued Miss
Lammas, “I asked him, ‘Have you
heard about the Miracle Man, Ra-
tana F’ Just before this some friends
of mine had gone through Ratana’s
camp near Wanganui and they
were greatly impressed by the evi-
dences of the wonderful cures
wrought by him. The doctor, re-
plying to my question, said that I
should write to Ratana. He added
that if he did not do me any good
he would certainly do me no harm,
fine doctor added: ‘We have tried
everything human; now r try the
super-human. It will be a real mir-
acle if you are cured.’ I wrote to
Ratana at once giving him a
short account of my case. I re-
ceived a reply a week later. Ra-
tana demanded absolute faith in
Jesus Christ, and said that I must
pray fervently and untiringly, ask-
ing it all in the name of the Trin-
ity. He added that he would also
pray for me ”
19
RATANA


Few pictures of Ratana’s mir-
acles are as telling as this scene
of Miss Lammas’ home. No story
is more sad than that of the
healthy mind in the perpetually
incapable body, and such secret
heroines as these who suffer agon-
ies of mind and body, are really
among the world’s grandest women.
Theirs is the life of forced idle-
ness and imprisonment. The very
sunshine is denied them unless
they ar© wheeled out inte it.
Theirs is not the joy of the nor-
mal woman who can rise in the
morning and face the day’s duties
with energy and fortitude. Thus
Miss Lammas had passed through
years of her life, an onlooker in
the gam© in which she was too
fragile and helpless to take part.
Thirty doctors had attended her.
The medical skill of this country
had been called in and had failed
to help her out of her tragedy.
And yet, a simple, unassuming
Maori, without even seeing her,
could, by virtue of his mysterious
power, cast out the weakness of
years and within a few days, re-
store this woman to activity and
the full enjoyment of life in which
she had. so far been such an un-
happy dependent.
The Cure.
Discussing the days which follow-
ed the receipt of Ratana’s letter,
Miss Lammas came to the most in-
teresting paid of her story. “On
the day that I received Ratana’s
letter,” she said, £ T prayed nearly
all day, hut nothing at all hap-
pened. As a matter of fact I felt
actually weaker then than before.
I continued praying nevertheless.
Early next morning when I was
praying again, my back suddenly
received power. To my great de-
light I was able to sit up in bed,
and then to stand and walk with-
out aid, the first time for years.
For the previous twelve months 1
had not been out of bed.
‘T walked round my bed half a
dozen times that day. I sat up for
a little while both morning and
afternoon, and to my great surprise
I required no support and felt no
pain. I felt marvellously better
straight away.
The Miracle Completed.
A few weeks after the receipt of
Ratana’s letter Miss Lammas was
able to go down the street for
walks, and of this she continues
her story as follows:
“I am able to go down the
street for short walks and I go
every morning if the weather is
nice. I carry only a stick, hut I
do not require this at all for the
support of my body. It is really
for my ankles which are subject
to a weakness that is not connect-
ed with my late serious bodily ail-
ment. I can now hold up my head
wonderfully well. ,
“Before I wrote to Ratana I had,
for eight years, to wear complex
glasses for an astigmatism of my
eyes. I mentioned this in my let-
ter and I have not needed to put
on the glasses since the day on
which I recovered the power to
walk.”
Miss Lammas showed her inter-
viewer a magnificent piece of point
lace work which she was doing,
20
RATANA


without the aid of the glasses. Upon
being questioned Miss Lammas
said that she believed her cure
well established and her faith in
the result of her healing is such
that she offered her wheel chair for
sal© by advertisement.
Closing her story Miss Lammas
said : “I rise every day about 10.30
a.m. I li© down twice during the
day for a rest. Unless I get very
tired I have no pain at all in my
back. Whereas previously I took
no end of medicine, I now take
none. lam still under observation
by the doctor, who, of course, is
greatly surprised at the change in
me, but I require no treatment
whatever. It is really wonderful
to be able to get into town and
to wait upon myself again, I
have crowds to see me and I have
received letters from ail over the
country, so great is the interest
created in my wonderful cure.”
There was a little dramatic mom-
ent as Miss Lammas closed her
story. She walked across the room
to a cupboard. She showed her
guest the steel frame which bad
previously been her aid to walk-
ing. It was no longer necessary.
The carefully devised frame, the
work of man, had been made un-
necessary through the simple
faith of the woman, expressed
through the help of the miracle
worker.
A Letter From Miss Lammas.
Perhaps you will think that the
newspaper man has elaborated Miss
Lammas’ story, so we print an
actual letter from this fortunate
patient of Ratana’s power. Writ-
ing early in June Miss Lammas
said: —“l am pleased to tell you
that I have made wonderful pro-
gress since you saw me, in spite
of the cold weather, which always
made me so much worse. I grow
stronger daily, and am increasing
in weight entirely to the doctor’s
satisfaction. He thinks my recov-
ery just marvellous. I can eat
practically anything now, and sleep
like a top, two things previously
impossible. Only three months
ago I was so seriously ill I
was waiting to die. Now I am a
new being, having neither pain
nor support! It is almost like be-
ing raised from the dead. I have
had lots of motor rides through the
kindness of friends which, as well
as my daily walks along th© streets,
I enjoy to the full. Truly the day
of miracles is not past. The first
time I went to church there was
great rejoicing, and the whole con-
gregation arose and sang the Doxo-
iogy!” This letter serves to show
two important aspects of Bat-ana’s
cure. Firstly it proves that Miss
Lammas’ story was not exaggerated
by the press, and secondly it shows
that after a period of two or three
months had passed, she was as well
as in the first days of her cure.
Rai ana’s good work was permanent.
Tribute From Minister,
In the early part of March, the
work of Ratana was referred to at
the annual conference of the Meth-
odist Church in Wellington, by
the Rev. Robert Haddon, He said
Ratana was a second cousin of his
own, and his grandfather was a
member of the Methodist Church
and had represented New Zealand
21
RATANA


at the Australian Commonwealth
celebrations. Rat ana’s work of
healing was like that of the Apos-
tles. It began by a period of se-
clusion and fasting, during which
the new power came to him, and
immediately by prayer and laying
on of hands, he cured a sick child.
His teaching was out-and
out Christianity. He opposes all
that injures the Maori—tohunga-
ism, drink and other vices. Ratana,
said Mr. Haddon, does not claim to
be a god-—he was merely a man, a
finger-post pointing people to God,
their Creator, and Christ, their
Saviour.
Morrinsvifle.
As we have seen in the previous
chapter, preparations at Morriine-
ville showed that Ratana was to
be gladly welcomed by the Natives
there. It was at the end of March
that h© arrived at the town to
meet 2400 Maoris who had gather-
ed from all parts of the surround-
ing country.
The Maoris About Him.
It is interesting to know how
these dark followers of the Miracle
Man gathered about him. We all
know how scattered is the Maori
population. You find tiny villages
here and there and little communi-
ties beside rivers or in the bush
country. These Maoris differ vast-
ly from the type we find in town;
the street corner Maori who has
lost almost every visible sign of his
race—except, of course, his colour.
The Maori of the hotel corner, the
Maori with the “smart” suit and
the bright tan boots, is not the
Maori of the pah, and even to this
day, you can find native settle-
ments- where some of the charm of
the primitive Maori remains. It is
from these that Ratana draws his
most enthusiastic followers, for the
Un-Europeanised Maori is a far
more interesting person than his en-
lightened brother. The primitive
Maori ig a philosopher and a ro-
manticist. He dresses life in imag-
ination and colour and his conversa-
tion is rich in simili and beauty of
ideas. Also, he has a keen sense
of humour. First, Ratana attracts
these people and then he arouses
a slumbering element in the ultra
civilised Maori of the street cor-
ner. In Morrinsville, Ratana’s fol-
lowing was made up from a mixed
people. He had the quiet, con-
tented Maoris, who still lore the
open country, which is their heri-
tage. He attracted the' town
Maori with his grand clothes and
his billiard achievements. These
gathered • around him to the num-
ber of 2400.
Arrival at Morrinsville.
On March 23, Tahu Wiremu Ra-
tana arrived at Morrinsville by
special train. He travelled with no
leas than 800 Maoris who were the
stars in the tail of the comet. So
he must have impressed the people
of Morrinsville for it 7 is seldom that
anybody travels through our Do-
minion with such a retinue.
Other Maoris.
Although held at Morrinsville
Ratana’s meeting was nob con-
fined to the Maoris of that dis-
trict. They travelled from the
Waikato and Hauraki Plains to see
him. Some came from as far as
22
RATANA


Taranaki, Wanganui, Hawke’s Bay
Kawhia in the North and even the
South Island.
A Dramatic Speech.
Ratana has kept himself away
from the limelight. He has avoid-
ed the public gaze and he has sur-
rounded himself with an air of
mystery. But at Morrinsville we ob-
tained a vivid picture of the man
himself. In such a gathering, with
so much interest attaching to Ms
visit, it was impossible to curtain
himself off from the curious. So
we saw him. And in what manner
did this miracle worker approach
the people? And in what manner
did he reveal his power to these
humble, faithful natives who had
travelled miles to see him?
The great man stepped forward.
He had an air of culture about
him and he could well have been
a. Maori doctor or legal man who
had obtained the advantages of
good education. He was stockily
built and commanding in the way
he stood before the natives; over
2000 of them. When one thinks of
the civilisation of this country, of
the progress, the commerce and the
sane utility which creeps into al-
most every channel of life here, it
is hard to connect this almost bar-
barian scene with 1921. When I
say it is barbarian I refer only to
the dark-skinned people who sug-
gested anything but a Christian
audience of 1921. All through the
ages, there have been men who hav e
risen as Ratana has done, to preach
to the people and heal them. His-
tory is dotted with them, whether
it be the history of the English
people or of the unenlightened na-
txves of less civilised countries. But
few have been attended with the
strange environment that sur-
rounds Ratana. Here is this man
of miracles, inspired entirely by his
faith in God, travelling on a rail-
way train, preaching by the light
of electricity, living as all Euro-
peans live, but representing some-
thing as far distant from the
times as is possible to imagine. He
is lifting the Maori people to high-
er living and higher thinking.
Would that his kind could be born
in Fiji or Samoa and bring the
glory of sane Christian ideals and
living before the indolent natives.
Prayer andi Retreat.
Nothing could be more quietly
impressive than Ratana’s speech to
the Maoris at Morrinsville. For an
hour and a half he talked to them,
urging them to higher ideals and a
better scheme of life. They listen-
en attentively and were obviously
impressed. But his days in Mor-
rinsville were not entirely spent in
talking and healing and for two
days hq went into retreat, occupy-
ing his time with prayer. And
while this great mysterious man
prayed in the quiet of his room,
the thousands of Maoris waited
outside, going about their duties
and helping to feed the visiting na-
tives.
It was impossible to meet Ra-
tana—that is if you were a white
man. There was a personal body
guard and thirteen special police
who excluded all white people from
the healer’s temporary home. Ra-
tana refused to meet the newspaper
man but deputed two members of
the local committee to give the
23
RATANA


press mait whatever information
and assistance he required.
The Healing.
And then came the magic mom-
ent of Ratana’s visit to Morrins-
ville! Then came the time of heal-
ing the cripples and sick natives
who had travelled far to see him.
On© hundred and fifty Maoris
went before him to tell their story.
Some, aged and bent with rheuma-
tism, hobbled lip to him. Others
were deaf or lame, and some, help-
ed by younger, stronger men, were
blind. And, this pitiful procession
crept up to Ratana! But there
was none of the mystic about Ra-
tana. He smoked his pipe quietly
as he asked each man what was his
trouble. One of the most remark-
able cases at Morrinsville was the
healing of an old man of seventy
years.
He had been a cripple for
fifteen years and this fact was im-
pressed upon us as he walked, or
hobbled up to Ratana with the aid
of two crutches. Ratana worked
with the old man for half an hour
and then, taking his crutches away
from him. told him to follow him.
Wonder of wonders! The poor old
cripple of half an hour ago was able
to follow Ratana unaided. But he
was not satisfied with walking, and
in his pleasure and excitement, he
danced and hopped about in child-
ish glee over his recovery. I think
this was one of the most impressive
cures affected by Ratana during
this part of his tour.
A Paralysed Arm.
Then cam© a Maori whose arm
was rigid at his side; paralysed and
useless'. Ratana proffered the usual
question and then told the man to
move his arm about. This he was
able to do, to the astonishment of
the Maoris who knew him. The
rigid arm of a few minutes ago was
almost normal again. Then came
a Maori on a stretcher. The sight
of the helpless man being carried
to Ratana on a stretcher was rather
dramatic. Slowly his bearers ap-
proached the healer and then the
stretcher was placed near his feet.
There were a few quiet sentences
passed between Ratana and his pa-
tient and then Ratana said: “Get
up and follow me.” And the
Maori slowly rose from his
stretcher and stood up. There was
a murmur of wonder running
around the circle of onlookers.
Then he left his stretcher and walk-
ed behind Ratana. But these strict-
ly physical evidences of Ratana’s
work are not all. His greater work
is with the inner man and he gives
each of these unfortunate sufferers
a potion for his soul as well as his
body. Ratana, in every case, ex-
horts the Christian beliefs and
tells his people to ignore the old
pagan beliefs of their people.

RATANA


CHAPTER IV.
The White People.
•Some white people had travelled
miles to see Rataxia. He would not
see them and they went away dis-
appointed. Bnt he sent a message
telling them to write to him and
he would do all that was in his
power.
The camp at Morrinsville even-
tually broke up after a period of
wonderful success. The local com-
mittee which arranged the visit
was immensely pleased with the re-
sults and Ratana’s name was al-
most sainted by the thousands of
Maoris who saw his work and heard
him speak. The quiet and order,
the attendances at the church ser-
vices and the general religious feel-
ing showed how deeply the natives
were impressed by this teacher—
this worker of miracles.
A Northern Tour.
It was while he was at Morrins-
ville that Ratana decided to travel
to the north, at the invitation of
Henare Toka, of Batley. Ratana
said he would certainly visit the
Ngatiwhatua tribe in the north,
probably in May.
Cured of Blindness.
Abont the time of the Morrins-
ville visit, we learned of a partic-
ularly wonderful cure credited to
Ratana. A Waikato native, who
had been blind for 25 years, was
the subject of the cure. For, a
quarter of a century this Maori
had been unable to see anything of
the' world about him. The tragedy
was the result of a strain' which he
endured. His eyes closed and his
sight was completely lost. This un-
fortunate native heard of Rat-ana’s
wonderful power and decided to see
him. After one interview with the
great man, the Maori was able to
see a little; just enough to enable
him to walk about without guid-
ance. This change thrilled him with
a wonderful faith which was, of
course, what Ratana wanted to see
develop in him. At this point we
would like again to stress®, the fact
of Ratana’s spiritual influence. In
relating these stories of his phy-
sical cures we wish also to impress
our readers with the-fact that Ra-
tana has a wider, more spiritual
message. His healing is inspired
by the desire for spiritual good,
and he accompanies all hi® cures
with a prayer for religions inspira-
tion and a higher ideal of living
for the patient who has come be-
fore him.
So in the case of this bland Wai-
kato Maori, when partially cured,
his faith in Ratana and the power
of which he is the visible minister,
was so firm that h© travelled back
to Ratana and asked for further
help. Since then we have learned
that the Maori is able to see as
well as his fellow tribesmen. It is
interesting to note- the stages of
this cure.
A Cure in Stages.
We usually imagine a miracle to
be a sudden dispelling of a wrong
or trouble. But in some oases,
Ratana’s cures are- gradual as if
they were a process more than a
sudden, miraculous change. This
confirms our faith in them, espec-
25
RATANA


ially when we review the case of
the blind Maori. After his first
visit to Ratana, the eyes opened
a little and he was able to see in-
distinctly. But a film remained
over the eyes and his sight was
partly interrupted. But Ratana pro-
mised a cure without surgical aid,
and this cure came. This case was
one of the clearest from the on-
lookers’ view, for the Maori was
well known as a blind man to many
white people in his district and
they were able to marvel when he
returned with his sight restored.
East Coast Tour.
Ratana’s next tour after his visit
to Morrinsville was to the East
Coast, Poverty Bay and the Bay of
Plenty. His enormous party mo-
tored over this country, spending
£l3OO in motor car expenses be-
tween Napier and Tauranga where
they joined the “Ngapuhi” to bring
them to Auckland. The East Coast
tour was over the usual rout© from
Napier to Wairoa, to Gisborne, and
then to Te Araroa near the East
Cape. There they joined launches,
visiting several settlements along
the coast, including Opotiki and
vv hakatane*
Financing the Tour.
One remarkable thing about Ra-
tana s tours is that h 6 accepts no
money from those he cures; not
even a contribution towards his ex-
penses. It so happens that Ratana
is a comparatively wealthy man
and that he is able to face the enor-
mous expenditure which is neces-
sary to travel as- he does. The ex-
penses for the Napier-Tauranga
trip alone were £l3OO and this was
but a section of his travels. His
followers told us that Ratana said
he knew that if he accepted money
he would lose his power.
A Comparison.
We have heard comparisons made
between Ghandi and Ratana, but
they can scarcely be drawn, for
there is a vast diffei’ence between
them. And since we are mention-
ing Ghandi, the famous Hindu agi-
tator, it, may not be amiss to men-
tion the topical fact that Manila!,
the Hindu lawyer recently in
Auckland, wag a friend of the great
man Ghandi while in London.
Ghandi is a political agitator al-
though an ascetic in ideals and
manner of living. Ratana is the
least worldly man imaginable. He
could not be compared with Ghandi
in main things, for although he
aims at improving the living con-
ditions of his fellow Maoris, he has
no interest in political affairs, and
the only link he acknowledges is
that between the spiritual and soc-
ial elements. He does not care
about the link between the social
and political.
incidents of the Tour.
The followers of Ratana told ns
that of the thousands of cases
which Ratana treated on the East
Coast, not one failed. At every
tiny village along the coast he
preached the gospel and healed the
people. One remarkable case took
place in Hawke’s Bay where Ra-
tana cured a cripple who had not
walked for 28 years. On the very
day that Ratana treated him he
26
RATANA


was able to walk into the town and
purchase the first pair of boots 1
had worn for 28 years.
In May last, Ratana spent a
week in the country around Whaka-
tane. He motored right up this
coast, over the beautiful road which
runs from Gisborne to Rotorua. It
is interesting, since we com© to the
Whakatane part of the story, to
mention the sacred rook which lies
near Whakatane town. This rock,
named Pohuturoa, stands in the
centre of the main street of the
town and has been preserved after
a lot of agitation, because of its
associations with the early Maoris.
Near this symbol of the old-time
religion, Ratana came to preach the
new faith, and to heal, by its in-
spiration, th© natives who were
suffering from various ailments.
During th© week, which was at th e
close of May, h© visited Waimana,
Ruatoki and Paroa, healing the
natives and adding to his reputa-
tion as a miracle worker. On May
28, he left Whakatane for Te
Teko, the little town which is built
on the side of the river, on the
way to Rotorua. Here again he
met a few natives and then left for
Rotorua. This country was full of
charm for Ratana. He passed over
Te Kooti’s track, past the sacred
stone which is a tiny brother of the
great rock at Whakatane. And
then, in the evening, he came to
Rotorua, the heart of the thermal
district, the home of thousands of
Maoris, and probably the biggest
field in which Ratana could test his
powers.
Ratana in Tauranga.
At Tauranga, merely through a
letter, a white woman regain-
ed her sight after years of blind-
ness. Her cure was even more
rapid than in the case of the Wai-
kato Maori who was cured in stages.
This white woman, merely by a let-
ter from E,atan a, was cured with-
in fifteen minutes.
Tauranga
At last Ratana arrived at Tau-
ranga where his East Coast tour
ended. Tauranga is a pretty lit-
tle town, with a slightly tropical
air because of the line of palms with
which its shore is outlined. Ratana
went to the near-by Maori settle-
ments, some miles from the town.
He had a retinue of thirty when he
arrived at Tauranga. He stayed at
the Waitoa native settlement which
is about eight miles from the
town. Like Ngapeke, Waitoa is to
the east of the town of Tauranga.
Although Ratana did not go into
the town, the quiet manner of his
arrival at the native settlement
did not prevent the Europeans of
the town travelling out to see him.
Thus in this district which is well
populated with Maoris, he repeated
the programme of other places, cur-
ing and preaching.
The Secretary.
May we step aside from the facts
of Ratana’s tour to record an in-
cident which shows us his secretary ,
who is, perhaps, the personality
next in importance to Ratana in
the party P The incident has been
recorded in th© daily papers as fol-
lows; —“As most people are aware,
the healer refuses to allow white
people to attend hife meetings, but
he is always willing to deal with
them by correspondence, and for
this purpose he keeps a young
27
RATANA


Maori as secretary. This young fel-
low is a returned soldier, and is
now one of the healer’s adherents.”
What this means was illustrated
when the party arrived in Auckland
from Tauranga. The secretary was
waiting on the pavement for Ra-
tana, when a pakeha, who had evi-
dently known him in the “old
days,” greeted him effusively and
went on to talk about “the fight
the other night in the Town Hall,”
taking it for granted that his
Maori friend had been there.
“I only got in this morning,” re-
plied the secretary.
“Going out to the races?” asked
the pakeha.
“Have cut it all out,” was the
reply of the secretary.
The pakeha was puzzled.
thus, if races and prize-fighting
be judged as wrong, Ratana cleans-
es the mind as well as the body.
Approaching Auckland.
While Ratana was in the South
and Auckland was dependent upon
the newspapers for news of him,
the Northern city did not become
very excited about his miracles.
But when it was known that he
would arrive in Auckland on June
8 there wag a great deal of excite-
ment. It was suggested that Ra-
tana be asked to hold a meeting in
the Town Hall and the papers were
crowded with letters expressing
various views of the miracle work-
er and his cures. Here is a short
letter which will servo to show
what interest was taken in Rata-
na’s advent. The letter expresses
the intelligent interest that was
felt by most people who thought
about the matter at all.
(To the Editor.)
Sir, —I am somewhat surprised
that in these days when we have
the gospel of the grace of God
preached almost at any street cor-
ner that F. Finley should not see
the power of God at the back of our
dark-skinned brother. I do not be-
lieve that Ratana can do won-
derful cures, but I do believe
that the effectual fervent prayer
of a righteous man availeth
much. This is all Ratana claims to
do. It would help F. Finley and
others, too, to understand this good
man if they would read for them-
selves the Epistle of Janies, from
verse 13. They would not fail to
see the foolishness of taking the
Town Hall for Ratana to cure crip-
ples. The Maoris are simple folks,
they take God at his word, that is
all.—l am, etc.,
CHRISTIAN.
Arrival ill Auckland.
On June 4 the East Coast tour
ended, and Ratana left Tauranga
by the “Ngapuhi” for Auckland. It
was an early morning arrival, but
it, was not too early for newspaper
reporters and photographers to h©
up and about, although they were
too late to catch the proverbial
worm. Ratana would not be in-
terviewed. He would not be photo-
graphed. So the newspapers had to
be content with an interview with
Peter Moko, Ratana’s secretary.
The “Ngapuhi” came alongside and
several hundred early risers wait-
ed on the wharf to see the man of
miracles.
28
RATANA


“Which is Ratana?” the waiting
crowd asked.
“Where is he?”
In a group of thirty Maoris it
was hard t.o tell which was the
great man, for through European
eyes, Maoris look very much alike,
and Ratana did not dress with any
distinct style to mark him out.
We asked a Maori if he knew
which was Ratana. He forgot, hie
English for the moment and would
not answer. Then the party stepped
ashore and we thought it would be
easy to find out which was the
great man. So we approached one
of them. “Which is Ratana?” we
asked. “Over there,” answered
the Maoxd, pointing to a Maori with
a brown hat and hand-bag. A re-
porter approached the man with a
brown hat and said, “Yon are Ra-
tana!” The man laughed quietly,
and said “No.”
So h e tried another Maori, “Ho
you know which is Ratana?” hr
asked. The Maori pointed to stir
another innocent native who was
not Ratana. The miracle man’s fol-
lowers were determined that he
should not be located. Thus this
strange man of mystery and noto-
riety hides away from the public
eye. In a party of thirty Maoris,
all of whom are loyal to his desire
to remain unknown, it was impos-
sible to locate him.
But at last he was identified by
a man who knew him in Wanganui,
and we were able to gaze, for a
brief moment, on the man who hr.
thrilled the white and native pro-
pie of New Zealand with the stories
of his supernatural power. He was
dressed in normal looking Euro-
pean clothes which could have be-
longed to anybody. Only hie face
revealed something of his power.
There, on that Auckland wharf, in
the early morning, with its city
noises and smoke, we saw him with
his people.
But he didn’t look at any-
thing about him. That calm, al-
most ethereal face seemed to gaze
out of a world of dreams. His eyes
looked at you as the eyes of some
of those old Maori priests gaze at
you from the Lindaeur portraits
Here was a man who had risen to
fame within a year. He had lived
on his farm for years, unknown and
quietly ignorant of his power. Now
he was a great man—an influence
a power for good. It seemed strange
to see him standing on the wharf
with all the signs of 1921 about him
and then to realise that he poss-
essed the power to heal, the power
to raise the maimed from their
couches and restore sight and hear-
ing. Thus on this quiet morning,
Ratana arrived in Auckland, the
first city h e had visited in his tour,
for up to then he had confided his
journeys to the native settlements
and small towns, not bothering
about the big centres.
A Pressman’s Search.
The “Auckland Star” reporter
had a diligent, search for Ratana
after he arrived. When he left the
wharf, he was soon lost as far ae
his identity was concerned, for he
was “any Maori” tp the public
29
RATANA


eye. But the “Star” man was
intent upon locating him, and de-
scribing his search afterwards, he
said:
“The healer had gone in search
of kai, and knowing the Maori pre-
deliction for sea fare, the reporter
did a little Sherlock Holmes and
scouted in front of a fish saloon.
Sure enough, in a few minutes, the
clue proved correct. A native of
about 46 years of age, slender,
clean-shaven, walking with a slight
stoop, came out. His thin face and
deep-set eyes bore all the marks of
a man given to dwelling on things
psychic, whether he be white,
brown or black. The type is the
same the world over.”
Healing ih Auckland,
On the same day, Wednesday,
June 9, Ratana went to the Maori
Hostel in Mechanic’s Bay, Auck-
land, and met the sick natives who
sought his aid. The hostel, which
has long been the centre for Maoris
in Auckland, is a strangely design-
ed building, with its rooms arrang-
ed around a central court yard,
open to the sky. Thug it fitted well
into the picture of faith healing. Ih
helped us to imagine the age when
miracles were worked more than
they are to-day. The Maoris who
sought Ratana were pitiful to F
Some walked with the aid of sticks,
and some were helped by younger
relations. Old men with the mark
of age in the bend of their back
and younger men, perhaps injured
in war, passed before Ratana. He
eat quietly in the centre of a group
of hig friends and interviewed the
natives as they approached him.
On© girl, obviously a mental pa-
tient, was taken t.o Ha-tana by her
friends. There was a younger h
who told me that his hip was in-
jured while he served abroad. He
hadl been a lieutenant with the
Pioneers and since returning to
New' Zealand had been unable to
lie on his injured side. I referred to
his case earlier in the story for he
was the educated native lad who
was cured within a few hours. I
mentioned his case to prove that
Ratana’s influence is not all with
the old, imaginative natives but
that he is equally successful with
the new generation.
A Chat With Peter Moko.
Ratana’s secretary was with him
in Auckland. W© have referred to
him several times but he is not ex-
hausted by the facts already men-
tioned. His very sane enthusiasm
for Ratana is a pleasant thing to
hear. And he ig not reticent
with interesting details about the
great man. He told us that an An-
glican Bishop is among Ratana’s
great adherents and that this dig-
nitary of the Anglican Church has
written to Ratana congratulating
him on his good work and offering
the services of one of his clergy for
mission work. Surely this tribute
from the church ig an assurance
that the healer’s work is viewed
with sincere appreciation by the
Christian section of the commun-
ity.
A Doctor’s Letter.
Medical men very often scoff at
any healing that is not the outcome
30
EATANA


of the medicine bottle or the sur-
geon’s knife. But many doctors
have added their tribute to Rata-
na-’s work and one medical man
wrote to him asking hie help in
cases where his own, the doctor’s
skill, was of no use. All Europeans
are dealt with by correspondence
and Peter Moko told us that some-
times there are as many as 150 let-
ters a day from white people.
These are all answered but pos-
tages have proved a heavy item
for only about 40 per cent of the
enquirers enclose stamps for their
replies.
An Offer From Abroad.
The information was given ns by
one member of Ratana’s party that
the great man has been offei'ed
sums of £40,000 and £50,000 to go
to England and America, but Ra-
tana’s creed is that money must
not be accepted. Enquiries have
come from every part of the world
and from such remote countries as
China.
A Correspondent.
This series of articles dealing
with the work of Ratana ha® fru
duced one correspondent to write
to us pointing out that only women
have been cured through Ratana’s
letters and that it is possibly the
over-imaginative typ© of woman
alone who is affected by the Maori
faith healer. To disprove any sug-
gestion that Ratana’s cures are
confined to women, we have search-
ed out the details of a Wellington
case where a European man has
been cured of a tubercular spine
after doctors and hospitals had
failed to help him.
The facts are as follow. The man,
a European, had spent seven
months and three weeks in the
General Hospital at Wellington.
His case was diagnosed, a© tubercu-
lar spine. The doctors treated him
and he spent thirty one weeks in
hospital, with no result. Then he
decided to write to Ratana. Hi® re-
ply came some days afterwards and
he was told to pray. In his letter
Ratana told the man to pray to
“Him with an unerring, unwam
ing an untiring prayer. That
wisdom of understanding acceded
thee, act accordingly, and thou
siialfc receive your request, but not
before; pray diligently in your time
of tribulation. Sanctify His name
and sing His praise in the name of
the Father, Son, Holy Ghost and
Holy Angels, for ever and ever,
Amen.”
It was in these simpl© words, not
new to the frequenter of the mod-
em church, that Ratana chose to
instruct the white man who wrote
to him. From Ratana’g letter to
the man we mov© to the verbatim
report of his conversation when he
was questioned after the great
change came over him. He said
that he prayed ag Ratana told him.
Describing his previous sickness,
the patient said: “I had twice been
operated upon, and there was a
wound in my groin through which
the discharge from a cist kept com-
ing very slowly .The wound would
not heal so long as the discharge
31
RATANA


continued. Now, I had faith, and
when I got that letter I believed
I was going to get better, though
they had told me I would be a
lucky man if I ever set foot on
the ground again.
From the time the nurse brought
me the message the discharge be-
came very free, amd within a week
it ceased, and the wound healed up.
I lay in bed for a fortnight after
that. Then one day about noon the
doctor came to me and said that I
might get up and sit in a chair for
a while,. They brought my clothes.
The doctor and the nurse were
there and I said I didn’t want any
chair. I walked about without even
feeling weak after I had put on
my clothes. And, remember, I had
lain for seven weeks on the broad
of my back, unable to turn one
side or the other. They asked me
if I didn’t feel giddy, and I said
“No,” because I wasn’t giddy at
all. That afternoon I strolled
around the grounds, and •was in the
band rotunda. I went to bed at
eight. 55
The patient had been out of hos-
pital a month when he related these
facts of his cure. There is one im-
portant fact not to be overlooked
in these cases of cures. They do
not hang on chance. They are per-
fectly obvious and leave no room
for question. They are not stories
handed from person to person and
elaborated. They need no prepara-
tion or dressing, but are given as
told by the patients themselves.
Staying in Auckland.
We omitted, in the previous
chapter to show that Katana’s
northern trip was broken by a few
days away from Auckland when he
left for the Maori settlements
arouM and north of Whan garni.
This short trip took place before
July 9, when he visited the Auck-
land and Orakei natives.
Near HeiemvHle.
From Auckland he went to
Helensville, or at least to Kewiti.
near by. There were about 250
Maoris there to greet him. There
was the usual great camp for them
and the European as well as the
.Maori people, contributed the food
which was to feed the Maori visitors
who travelled in to meet Katana.
The white residents sent two bul-
locks towards the feast and alto-
gether the meeting was a great
success. Katana was, of course,
enthusiastically received and his
work was successful. While there,
a new church was opened and a
monument was consecrated to the
memory of the late Rev. Paul. Ka-
tana and his party joined the train
again after their stay at Kewiti
and travelled to Kanganui, and
then by launch to Otamatea where
happened one of the greatest cures
attributed to Katana. This cure,
concerning a famous old Maori
woman, is deserving of fullest de-
tail, although we have condensed
the story as much as possible.
On this northern journey Ka-
tana was accompanied by about 45
32
SATANA


of his native follower®. Of these
about thirty were his own people
from Ratana, Wanganui.
A Noted Old Woman.
One of the aged Maori women
who was cured of blindness is al-
ready accorded a place in the his-
tory of th© Maori people. Sh© is
Rahui, widow of Tenatahi, parti-
culars of whom we remember when
we turn our memories to th© days
of the Little Barrier being declar-
ed a bird sanctuary. Tenatahi was
th© picturesque old chief who re-
fused to leave the little island in
the Hauraki Gulf when the State
decided tc declare it a bird sanc-
tuary. The old man was proud of
his ancestral home and ignored
the sheaf of letters which ordered
his departure. Not until a police
party went to the island did Tena-
tahi and Rahui leave the charming
little island. And this was the same
Rahui who went before Ratana at
Otamafcea a few months ego.
Another incident in iffie old
woman’s life is worthy of note. On
one occasion when she was crossing
from the mainland to the Little
Barrier in a boat, accompanied bj
her husband, the boat upset in a
storm. They had to swim through
the raging sea for the island. The
chief, a strong man, called out to
her that he would have to give it
up but she balled “Haere atu!
Haere atu” (Go on! Go on!) and
helped him. He made another ef-
fort and with his wife’s aid he
reached the land. It is a Mttle
story which gives us a picture of
the old-time Maori woman who was
as capable as her lord of meeting
and overcoming difficulties. And
this was the Rahui who was cured
of blindness by Ratana.
The story of her cure is vouched
for by two Maoris well known in
Auckland. They are Otene Paul
and his brother of Orakei. They
carried the old woman into the
presence of Ratana. Rahui is very
old. She is one of the aged Maoris
who remember New Zealand before
the triumph of the white man. She
knew Auckland when there was no
city here and when her dark lord
and his fellows hunted for their
food and fought for their indepen-
dence first against their tribal ene-
mies and then against the white
invader. So she was an interest-
ing subject to test Ratana’s
powers. Blind and almost help-
less with the marks of age upon
her, she was carried 1 before Ra-
tana. He spoke to her and then
lit a match.
“Gan You See?”
Ratana held the light Before the
blind woman’s eyes and said, “Can
yen see?”
“Ah! I can see something like a
star,” she replied.
‘‘How is that?” he asked as he
moved it further off.
“Yes,” she said, “that is all
right.”
It was a dramatic moment.
The old, old woman was excited
and her people went mad with en-
thusiasm.
33
RATANA


Without any dramatic move-
ment or words, Ratana had cured
her, and the people who saw him
rejoiced loudly when Rahui walked
out of the building without aid.
The cure was too obvious to be
questioned. She was blind for five
years and was carried before Ra-
tana. She was able to see within
a minute and this was proved by
the fact that she walked out un-
aided and had to pick her way over
the prostrate forms of the Maoris
sitting in the building. If you cared
you could meet Rahui in that
Maori village where she lives and
she would tell you herself what
Ratana did for her.
Prom Otamatea, where 350
Maoris had gathered to meet him,
Ratana went to Dargaville and then
to the Kaihu settlement where
400 people waited for him. His suc-
cess was repeated and then he
went to Otaiwi, near Whangarei.
Prom there he went to Atiria
and Kaikohe, on the line
which runs from Whangarei
to Opua. The stories of these visits
were the same as the stories from
other places. He cured every time,
and added hundreds of Maoris to
his list of adherents.
After visiting the Bay of Islands
district, he came hack to Auckland
and met hundreds of Maoris at
Orakei.

RATANA


CHAPTER V.
An Adverse Aspect.
So far, our story has been all of
Ratana’s triumph and power. But
there was agitation against him and
his work has been subjected to much
adverse criticism. The strange
thing is that this criticism has
not been from the church and
indeed, in almost every case, the
ministers of the Christian church-
es have championed Ratana from
the pulpit, recognising his powers.
But the outstanding case of argu-
ment against him was conveyed in
a letter from a school teacher in
the North. It came to hand a good
time after this Northern tour, but
as it relates to this part of the
story, we include in this chapter.
The school teacher wrote as fol-
lows;-—“Much has been published
about the good work Ratana is do-
ing, but there is another phase of
his work that must be considered,
a potent factor for ill to be reck-
oned with. It may not be gener-
ally known that Ratana carries
with him a book. Natives say those
who sign this book pledge not to
take medicine in any form or even
seek medical aid, but to trust
in prayer alone. Even children of
nine are allowed to sign.
“Disastrous results are already
seen. I will quote one of many
cases. Recently a woman sought
medical aid on the eleventh hour.
Investigations revealed a horrible
state of affairs. The woman had
been ill for a fortnight, during
which time she had suffered agony,
the pain at times being so intense
as to cause unconsciousness. Her
Bowels had not moved for over 12
days. She expected to be confined
in three months, but neglect had
caused the death of the foetus and
subsequent abortion. An. obstruc-
tion was formed in the bowel which
ruptured, peritonitis settling in and
death ensuing.
“Everything that medical skill
could - do, was done, but assistance
was called too late. The natives had
refused to do anything for the
woman, even to give her castor oil
or any other similar remedy. The
woman was naturally robust and
could easily have recovered had she
received proper attention at the
beginning. Some idea of her vital-
ity may be gained from the fact
that for eight hours previous to
her death she was pulseless, fail-
ing even to react to digitalin.
“The native® now firmly assert
that the woman died because she
sought medical aid and took medi-
cine and that had she continued in
prayer alone she would have re-
covered.
‘T am not prejudiced against Ra-
tana and his work. On th© con-
trary I am a believer in the effi-
cacy of prayer. Such results may
even be diametrically opposed to
Ratana’s intentions, but,, neverthe-
less, they show the native inter-
pretation of Ratana’s idea. The
whole thing has degenerated into
fatalism and religions fanaticism.
As such, how much better is it than
tohnngaism P It is not even more
35
RATANA


insidious, inasmuch as it has pa-
keha recognition, an achievement
tohungaism did not even hope for?
Innocent lives are being sacrific-
ed.
VHiat if an epidemic should
come? Mould not native settle-
ments be hotbeds for the diseem-
iuation of contagion? Why should
Ratana* a native, understanding
the ten dency of the native mind to
extremes, induce his fellows to
sign a book at all? Children are
neglected. Hakihaki and other
skm diseases are spreading. If a
European were to neglect his off-
spring. he would be prosecuted,
and rightly, too. Why should a
Maon be allowed to go free? 1%
there not one law for both? Whv
cannot an example be made for one
or two? Would it not have a
wholesome effect? For the sake of
~ 6 innocent children who are suf-
fering and the health of the com-
munity in general,
•mould be do 11%, immediately to stem
this baneful influence. The matter
is urgent.”
There is a goad deal of sense ana
as much intolerant short-sighted-
ness in this letter. It ig obvious!f
the work of a school teacher, al-
though we wish to lay no cruel
judgment on the style of these of
Mr. Parr’s elect. Every crop of
fruit; has a few failures and if
there ar© evil influences in the
wake of Ratana, they are not ac-
tually caused by him. They are the
result of uncleanliness and laziness
and fatalism which Ratana does
not preach. It is absolutely wrong
to state that the miracle man
preaches or encourages fatalism,
and he is essentially a law pro-
moter, a sane preacher and an in-
fluence for social betterment and
a higher standard of living
amongst the Maoris, Ratana
would never have encouraged the
woman mentioned in this case to
pursue the course which ended in
her death.
A Humorous Moment,
It is our duty in telling Kata-
na’s story to be both truthful and
complete. Therefore w@ must not
omit a purely ridiculous Ratana
paragraph which went the round
of the newspapers recently.
Even Ratana himself possesses
sufficient sense of humour to know
that the following product of the
“wag” is kindly meant and not
intended to belittle his work and
influence:—
A Wellington paper said that :
“Two friends, one of whom was
blind and the other dumb decided
to go to Ratana and me 'if he
could cure their afflictions. With
some difficulty they secured an in-
terview, and Ratana, after ex-
pressing the necessity of faith, dir-
ected the blind man to go to a cer-
tain carpenter’s shop and the dumb
man to a wheelwrights. This they
accordingly did. The blind man
walked in, picked up a hammer
and saw, and the dmnb man grasped
a wheel and spoke. ’ ’
Ratana’s Day.
While w e leave th© story for a
moment, we can forget the patients
36
RATANA


and devote a few lines to Ratana
himself. In keeping him in the
background, as a personality, it
is a matter of necessity more than
choice. We opened, our record with
a description of the great man’s
reticence and desire for quiet. He
still refuses to see the newspaper
nan and the photographer. But
we did manage to learn a little of
how he spends his time when away
from tl © Maori people who are
forever approaching him for help.
His day is well ordered and carried
out to time-table. H© is very much
an ascetic in his habits and his life
is strictly free of superficialities.
He starts hia day early and spends
jabout half an hour in. prayer at
seven o’clock in the morning.
Breakfast oome-s at 8 a.m., and tea
at 6 p.m. The mid-day meal is cut
out, and in this manner Ratana
eats only what is necessary, think-
ing as many of his kind have
thought, that we eat about twice
as much as is necessary to keep us
well and fit. Cutting the mid-day
meal out, hig working day is from
about 8.30 to o p.m. during which
hours be is perpetually interview-
ing the hundreds of Maoris who
seek Mm, and, also answering let-
ters. At 7 p.m. there is further
prayer and thus Ratana’s day
closes unless the evening is given
to further interviews.
Ratana At Orakei.
Before he left Auckland after his
northern trip, Ratana visited Ora-
kei, the only native township which
has survived the growth of Auck-
land city. Orakei is a pleasant
little place, but Maori atmosphere
lias almost departed because of the
influx of European ideas, and the
Orakei Maori of to-day shows few
signs of his pagan ancestor. But
they are Maoris, and students of
these natives tell us that al-
though w© lament the death of
the true Maori and the birth of
the ultra-civilised type, these na-
tives are unchanged from a psy-
chological point of view 7 and beneath
the “smart” tailored suit and
European mannerisms, the Maori
brain reasons and the Maori heart
beat® to the same tune as it did
one hundred years ago.
These views are partly borne out
by the welcome which was given
to Ratana when he went to the
little township. It lies on the
shore of the Auckland Harbour,
on the city side and is reached ijy
both car and ferry steamer.
Ratana’s Arrival.
The village meeting house was
the centre of interest; for the visit,
in all Maori villages the meeting-
house: is the “town hall,” the
Mlouse of Parliament,” and even
tii© “Cathedral,” since the great
death tangis are held in it. Thus it
serves many purposes. The one at
Orakei does not come into the
glory of the old-tim© meeting-
houses where warriors were wel-
comed back from war, tangis were
held and councils sat. But now
and again Orakei does have a little
crumb of its old-time importance
and one of these crumbs came
w hen Ratana advanced towards
37
RATANA


the meeting-house with his follow-
ers. He had arrived by the “Clay-
more” from the North and avoid-
ed the city by landing from the
“Claymore” straight on the Orakei
wharf. A local Maori committee
met him and Messrs. Paul and
Broughton were the chief of these
The Maoris have a link with the
knights of old in the manner they
carry their banner or ensign to
denote the special mission on which
they ar© engaged. Ratana was
heralded by a large white flag with
a star and crescent, over the Union
Jack next the staff, and the words
the Father, God the Son,
the Holy Ghost and the Holy An-
gels” in Maori and English cover-
ing the whole of the flag. This great
flag flew in front of Ratana and
his party as they slowly advanced
towards the meeting house, set in
the village square or marae. As
they slowly walked to the meet-
ing bouse the welcomers could be
seen. They were drawn up in front
of the meeting house and they
•started the customary cries when
Ratana came into view. Added to
this they waved white handker-
chiefs in unison as he advanced.
All our schools and training have
not eliminated the peculiar cry
which is a characteristic of the
Maori, man or woman. It has been
described by visitors as the most
©laintive sound they have heard,
"t is a simple cry, with a thread of
orrow and sadness running through
t. Perhaps it is more a wail than
nything. During a tangi when
■he Maoris congregate around the
dead body, this cry, in chorus, con-
tinues sometimes for days, without
ceasing. And thus Ratana came
into the village square. The Maori
welcome ended with the wail and
waving of handkerchiefs. They did
not dance and gesticulate as they
so often do. Perhaps it was the
religious mission of Ratana that
subdued them.
And of Ratana !
W© saw him closer than ever
before on this day. From a cor-
ner we watched him advance, with
that great white flag waving in
front of him. He was the least
moved of the great assembly. He
was dressed entirely in black,
frock coat, trousers and hat com-
bining to add the clerical air. A
pressman standing near said that
he was very much lik© the Rev,
Bennett, the well-known Maori
minister of Rotorua,
Ratana walked as far as the vil-
lage square and the cries ceased
while he informally talked to
members of the committee. Al-
though it was fairly early in the
day, Ratana did not interview any-
body, but retired to rest.
Thus he spends all the time
he is not seeing visitors. Fasting,
praying, resting and ascetic meals
are the order of the time when he
is away from the work of help-
ing the sufferers who come to him.
Sunday Church Parade.
Following the manner of other
towns, the Orakei Maoris made lav-
ish preparations for feeding the
38
RATANA


visitors who came to Ratana’s meet-
ings. Two large marquees were
erected and the quiet tittle Maori
village to which us Aucklanders are
accustomed, was turned into a busy
little town for a brief day or two.
Maoris had come overland and Ora-
kei’s population was more than
trebled for the week-end.
At a Distance.
Europeans had to view the meet-
ings from a distance except on
Sunday afternoon when a church
parade was held. When it was
known that white people would be
admitted tp the parade, large num-
bers of people travelled to the vil-
lage. But they were disappointed
as far as Ratana was concerned for
the service was taken by the Rev.
Mnnro and the healer did not ap-
pear. To those of us who were ac-
customed to the sombre atmosphere
of a city church, this strange ser-
vice was full of surprises. Idle
preacher wore the orthodox clerical
black, hut the congregation was
eminently cosmopolitan. Some of
the Maori visitors wore expensive
European clothes while others were
contented with the utmost sim-
plicity. But all betrayed the Maori
affection for bright colour.
At the close of the service, the
Europeans were asked to leave the
village and when the sun went down
it drew a curtain over the happen-
ings in the little town of Orakei,
But the Maoris told ns the story
of what passed on that Sunday
night, during the following day.
Many cures were effected and the
natives who arrived sick or lame
invariably walked away, restored
and happy. The work of interview-
ing went, on late in the night
and Ratana’s afternoon of rest was
more than paid for by his long
night’s ministry.
39
RATANA


CHAPTER VI.
A Cure Refuted.
It is not often that the announce-
ments of Ratana’s cures have been
refuted or even questioned in anv
way. Bnt the case of a returned
Maori soldier at Rotorua was ques-
tioned by the Commandant of
the King George Hospital. W©
remember that at the time
many people who did not champion
Ratana, took this case as a proof
against him. But it is absurd to
see so much in the answer of the
Commandant, printed below. On
reading the letter or interview with
the Commandant, it is easily seen
that it is a guarded, official state-
ment, and really an expression of
ignorance of the case rather than
a denial.
A Letter.
Interest in the case was first
aroused through a letter published
in the Taumarunui paper, coming
from the soldier in the King George
Hospital to a friend in Taumarunui.
The letter read as follows:
“There is a most wonderful ex
ample of a Ratana cure here. A
Maori came in here three days ago.
He had been at Narrow Neck hos-
pital for two years on crutches with
a crushed hip. He was due to leave
here on Saturday for Narrow Neck,
hut he asked the Commandant’s
permission to go to Orakei on Satur-
day to see Ratana, who asked him
if he believed there wag only one
God, and if he repented his tains,
etc. His answers being satisfactory,
Ha-tana said: ‘ln the name of the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, yon
are cured. Put away your
crutches.’
“He said a warm feeling like a
hot wave went through Mm. He
put away his crutches against the
marquee, and then Ratana said,
‘Walk,” and he took hi a first step,
feeling very uncertain of himself,
not having been off crutches for two
years, but he took another step,
and then walked as well as ever
he did.
“It all took place in under five
minutes, and two days after I saw
him running like a hare. Isn’t it
miraculous ? He has just come
back here to thoroughly regain his
strength. The doctors here were
very greatly interested.”
A Dental.
The matter of the alleged cur©
was referred to the Commandant of
the hospital, who stated that he
knew absolutely nothing about it,
and had never given a Maori or
any patignt permission to go to Ra-
tana, nor had such permission been
asked. The returned soldier who
wrote to his friend in Taumarunui
was not quite accurate in his
statements because the Maori pa-
tient who was due to leave for
Narrow Neck would have had some
difficulty in getting there as Nar-
row Neck Military Hospital was
closed many months ago. Regarding
the merits of Ratana’s treat-
ment the commandant had noth-
ing to say, bnt as far as the cure
of this Maori patient was concern-
40
RATANA


ed neither he nor the other hospital
doctors had ever heard anything
about it.
An interview With Rev. Munro,
The Rev. Piri Munro, who was
with Ratana when he was in Auck-
land and who conducted the Sunday
service at Orakei, gave an impres-
sive and surprising account of
his tour with the healer shortly
after that Sabbath afternoon.
On the Sunday which we have de-
scribed, th© Rev. Mr. Munro, spoke
to a large audience at Orakei, but
he did not satisfy the curiosity
about Ratana’s personality as he
did in this later interview. ‘•'Ra-
tana,” said Mr. Munro, “was an
ordinary Maori.” He went on to
describe his early farming life as
we did in the first part of this nar-
rative, but added, “During the in-
fluenza epidemic Ratana was im-
pressed at the appalling amount of
sickness.
A Strange Sight.
Mr. Munro continued; “One day
as Ratana was sitting on the ver-
andah he noticed a ball of cloud
rise from a large pond in front of
his house, and after flying over
some sandhills, it burst.”
Ratana in a Trance.
‘Ratana fell into a trance which
lasted until evening. Not long af-
ter this singular happening, he
commenced to take peculiar fits
and walked alone about the farm,
crashing through fences and other
obstacles. He would not allow
anyone to come pear him and his
mind suddenly became a blank. He
later became subject to violent
moods, and while in these, he
would break up furniture in the
house and smash the telephone. He
became so violent that his wife
arranged for him to to sent to a
mental hospital.”
Suspected Insanity.
“He was strapped to a chair, but
half an hour before the train ar-
rived he awakened, saw bis bonds
and said, Tf you have any love for
me take these off.’ He was re-
leased and from that time onward
the violent fits never came again,
and Ratana remained at the
farm.”
Continuing bis story, Mr. Munro
said; “One day Ratana noticed a
ball of cloud, similar to the on©
h© had seen previously, at the
other end of a room he occupied.
As before, it burst, and appeared
to divide into two forms. One
seemed to become a Celestial be-
ing, and Ratana received hig com-
mission to heal the bodies and
minds of his people.
“Ratana had a nine-year-old boy
who had unsuccessfully undergone
several operations, and was to be
sent to hospital once more for an-
other operation. Ratana said: ‘The
boy will be operated on but not
by doctors. It will be by the hand
of God.’ The boy was cured of his
affliction. From that time Ratana
did nothing else but attend to
hundreds and hundreds of afflicted
natives. Last Christmas he invited
natives to assemble at- his farm
41
RATANA


where he had had a meeting-house
erected. He did some wonderful
healing and people began to realise
that the source of his power was
something above natural. From
Christmas last, he had been daily
treating upwards of 200 natives.”
A Definite Command.
Last May a definite intimation
was received by Ratana through
the Celestial Being that he was to
visit natives all over the North,
South, and Chatham Islands, and
go to whatever settlement invited
him. He set out on his tour. At
his first meeting 500 natives pub-
licly declared their faith in the
Holy Trinity and said they would
renounce the old gods of their fore-
fathers.
Mr. Munro explained that Ra-
tana asked him to continue with
him in the.mission, as they worked
in and the bishop’s con-
sent having been obtained, re re-
mained with the healer and came
South with him. His own duty
was to speak to assemblies and
create a proper spiritual atmos-
phere. He understood the Maori
mind. His great grandfather was
one of the last of the high priests,
and the oracles of Maori paganism
had been passed on to him by his
grandfather, who had brought him
up.
“Maoriism and Tohungaism.”
“Knowing th© Maori mind,” he
said, “I watched Ratana closely
and I have never once seen in his
work the slightest indication of
‘Maoriism.’ It may be asked why
should Ratana not treat Pakehas
also? I think Ratana is being
used to free the native mind from
the influence of ‘Maoriism’ or ‘To-
hungaism,’ and his gift of healing
is only given to impress the people.
I never realised before how steeped
our race is in ‘Maoriism. ’lt is
often disheartening to see native
boys and girls, after receiving a
good education and being well
placed in the world, suddenly go
wrong and make a mess of the
whole thing. Their failure must be
attributed to the Maori mind,
which some time or other takes
charge of the psychological posi-
tion and diverts the steps. We
Maori clergy have failed to over-
come the handicap of the Maori
mind, but Ratana has been raised
up by God to do so. It has been
indicated to him that his itinerary
through the Maori settlements
must cease next Christmas. He
does not know if he is to contin-
ue in the mission of healing after
that, but a great gathering of na-
tives will be held at his place next
Christmas Day.”
Raftana’s Mail.
We have several times recorded
the fact that Ratana’s mail bag
plays a big part in his life, but it
was not until August that any at-
tempt was made to find out exactly
how many enquiries he had receiv-
ed from abroad. During the
months from January to August of
this year. Ratana received no less
than 51,000 letters from all parts of
the world, including U.S.A., Hono-
lulu, Cuba, Spain, Italy, Ger-
42
RaT'jSN'A


many, Austria, India, Ceylon,
Samoa, Tonga and Australia. His
daily mail averages 275 letters.
Leaving Auckland.
We have broken away from our
narrative in the last chapter to
dwell on the opinions of the Rev.
Munro and the last movement of
Ratana’s, which we recorded was
his arrival at Orakei, the * little
Maori settlement near Auckland.
He left there after a few days for
the South again and he gradually
made his way back to Wanganui
where he is still living. We fol-
lowed him from Auckland to Ra-
tana, the township which bears his
nam e and which is a few miles from
the x’iver town of Wanganui.
Ratana had been wonderfully
successful in the North, hut he was
tired and needed the short rest
which came to him when he arriv-
ed back at h‘ig home. This journey
from Auckland to the village of
Ratana closes our story as far as
the travel is concerned for it
brings us up to to-day. Ratana
spent most of the intervening time
interviewing people at his home.
We went by train to Marton and
then to the township of Ratana in
the hope of speaking to the miracle
man. But he closed himself up
from the white man’s curiosity and
is still the reticent, mysterious be-
ing that he was when he started
on Wis career of healing.
In a previous chapter we referred
to a letter from a North Auckland
school teacher in which he or she
accused Ratana of inducing the
Maoris to sign a book and promise
not to seek medical aid in time ot
sickness. This statement is denied
by the Rev. Munro, who has
travelled with Ratana during a
great deal of the time. ‘‘The
book,” said Mr. Munro, “which
the Maoris voluntarily signed, was
a public denunciation of spiritism,
and a renewal of their faith in the
Trinity. No child under fourteen
signed this book, although the par-
ents might sign on behalf of their
children. This book has the signa-
tures of over 25,000 Maoris.
Ratana’s mission was to exorcise
evil spirits. To him the Maori
people were all in the grip of
Maorispn (or Spiritism). By Maor-
ism, he meant the belief of the
Maori people that they were in-
fluenced in all their doings by the
spirits of their forefathers, whereas
Ratana and he (the speaker) both
contended that they were evil
spirits-. The root source of nearly
all the ailments to which the
Maoris are addicted is due to these
evil spirits, so that Ratana by cast-
ing out the evil spirits is able then
to heal them.
Ratana diagnoses each case sep-
arately from that point of view.
After the patient has renounced
his faith in spiritism, and express-
ed his belief in the power of the
Trinity, Ratana exorcises the evil
spirits, and then pronounces his
blessing in the words ‘Let life arise
wuthin you.’ This blessing is fol-
lowed by the question ‘How do you
feel?’ to which in the majority of
cases the answer is, ‘The pain is
gone.’
43
RATANA


“ ‘What does this mean?’ asked
Mr. Mumx). “It means that Ratana
is justified in his outlook. He does
not attack the medical profession
in any way whatsoever. He frankly
says lie knows nothing of the
scientific methods of healing sick-
ness. His only mission is to combat
spiritism which in the case of the
Maoris is at the bottom of much
of their sickness.”
Other causes of sickness among
the Maoris, according to Mr.
Munro’s own observation, are due
to mental hallucinations, power of
suggestion, and makutnism or hyp-
notism. In the case of sickness,
a Maori who consults a medical
man should be carefully diagnosed
to gee whether his illness is due to
any of these four cases, or whether
it is due to other ordinary causes.
RATANA


CHAPTER VII.
The End of Our Story
Our story of Ratana’s miracles
ends this week since the record
brings us tip to date. We cannot
pose as prophets in the matter of
Ratana’s career and must leave the
future to time. But we can point
out the interesting circumstances
which he claims, is part of his
power. Ratana believes that his
power will depart next Christmas,
wnen he is to call the Maori people
about him again at his home and
hold a grand meeting. Whether
the power will merely die from him
or depart with the same sensation-
al vision as it came, when he saw
balls of cloud rise from the lake
and when h© saw a celestial being
in front of him, we cannot tell, but
it will certainly be a remarkable
sight to see the thousands of
Maoris who have promised to travel
to the little township, turning it
Into a great, seething camp of
people within a few days.
Permanence of Cures.
It is apparent that the people
who were originally cured by Ra-
tana have continued in the improv-
ed state of health and the white
people whose cures were 'effected
by letter, assert that their good
has been permanent. How long
this will continue is a mystery at
present, but it is a sane thing to
suppose that a cure which has last-
ed a year will last for ewer.
There have been sad aspects tc
the career of the subject of these
articles. Ratana has been accused
of having an evil influence as well
as a good one. It is not our func-
tion to uphold or even criticise Ex-
tana, but merely to set down the
stories of his cures as they are told
by the patients. But we must ad-
mit a certain distressing element in
the way Maoris have blindly avoid
ed medical aid when Ratana has
departed from their midst and they
have relied on his power to cure
them even if he didn’t know they
were ill. But Ratana, contrary to
some reports, did not encourage
this view and he has always said
that he does not urge the natives
to avoid medical aid. Nor does he
ask them to sign any nook promis-
ing not to see doctors although he
has been accused of doing so.
I have heard it rumoured that
Parliament will he asked to stop
Ratana’s work under the plea that
it is doing more harm than good.
This may be a mere tale and it w
very hard for anybody to sweeping-
ij say whether Ratana’s power for
good is balanced by a certain ele-
ment of undesirable influence.
It may be possible for those who
do not support Ratana to place
their finger on instances where he
has failed to help the natives, but
it will not be possible for these
45
EATANA


same people to disprove the many records which we have published
instances where he has undoubted- will help the outside world to un-
ly cured people, both Maori and derstand a little more clearly the
European. mystery of this wonder man who
With these little reflections, we has created so much interest during
close our story, trusting that the the past two years.

Ratana’s GIFT of HEALING
Is the same Divine and Spiritual
Power that was exercised by Chrtst
and the Apostles,
This power is the legitimate fruit
of a higher spiritual life and is
acquired less by intellectual study
and book-learning than by purity
of living and intense spiritual de-
votion.
This power has and always will
be available for suffering humanity
when the proper conditions for its
manifestation are secured.
These conditions can be secured,
are being secured, and demonstra-
tions of Divine Healing may be
witnessed in Auckland to-day.
Blind Faith, Hypnotism, Sugges-
tion and “make believe’ 7 have no
part in this Healing Gift, which
is bestowed by the laying on of
hands and is described as a warm,
soothing, peaceful vibration which
overcomes pain and weakness and
destroys melancholia an<J pessimism.
This wonderful vibration is a
direct infusion of actual magnetic
vitality and is more helpful to
weakened bodies than a transfusion
of blood. Few fail to obtain a
cure—none fail to get material
benefit.
