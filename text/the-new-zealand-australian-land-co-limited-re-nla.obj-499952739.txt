The new Zealand & Australian Land Co.
LIMITED.
Remarks by the Chairman, Robert Stewart, Esquire of
Ingliston, in moving the adoption of the Directors’
Report, at the Annual General Meeting, held at
204 West George Street, Glasgow, 30th November
1877.
Gentlemen,
The Report is in your hands, and I suppose
it may be held as read. I would however call attention to a
slight error in it: on the second page it is stated that the Ten
per cent, written off Buildings and Fences by the Canterbury
and Otago Association was upon the gross amount, it should
have been as stated in the Auditor’s Report, but this does not
affect the opinion expressed by the Colonial Managers in regard
to this item.
I do not know that there is anything I can say at this, the
first Meeting of the New Company, in regard to the Amalga-
mation of the Old Companies (viz.: —The New Zealand and
Australian Land Company Limited and Reduced, and the


Canterbury and Otago Association Limited), in addition to what
is stated in the Report; the delay in getting the Bill through
Parliament was unavoidable, and we are indebted to the Law
Agents, Mr. Murray and Mr. M'Grigor, for the great care they
bestowed upon it, and for having managed it so well; and now
that it is an accomplished fact, I trust the good hoped for
from it will be realized in due time.
As indicated in the Circulars sent to the Shareholders when
the Amalgamation was contemplated, one of the objects
was to enable the Stock of the Company to be put upon the
Stock Exchange in a proper form. Only a very few people knew
of the existence of the old Companies; and their Debentures and
Stock were consequently not sufficiently known to obtain for
them the position they ought to occupy with Investors. That
object is now secured, the Articles of Association of the New
Company having been submitted to, and approved of by, the
Committees of the London and Glasgow Stock Exchanges.
I have no doubt Investors will soon learn to appreciate the
value of the Debentures and Stock of the Company; the
Dividend on the Preference being cumulative makes that
Stock a peculiarly desirable Investment,
The Clip of wool of the old Companies from Australia has
been very uniform during the last nine years, but from New
Zealand it has increased from 4,G38 bales in 18G8 to 7,387 bales
in 1877; and the total Clip of the two old Companies, from
Australia and New Zealand, which, in 1868, was G,720 bales,
has, in 1877, reached 10,430 bales, inclusive of 808 bales from
Till Till station, recently purchased.
And now, Gentlemen, in respect to the business of the New
Company, the result of last year’s operations will be gathered


from the Balance Sheet and statements therewith ; and although
the profits from the Colonies are considerable, amounting to
£145,833 ss. 9d., lam sorry that they are not larger. One
cause for that will be found in the Queensland properties,
which have for some time been a source of anxiety to the
Directors. These are so distant from any seat of management
that proper supervision could not be exercised over them,
thus rendering them undesirable holdings. They have been
disposed of, and as the buyers will be able to bring more
direct supervision to bear on them than could be done by this
Company, I hope the result will justify the price at which
they have been sold, which is a full one in consideration of
the time given for payment and the moderate rate of interest.
In addition to the security over the properties as sold, the
buyers are bound to make improvements, and put on further
Stock to the value of £30,000.
The great feature in Australasian affairs is the rage for
Freehold Land. Even in Australia, where the extent is almost
unlimited, all good land within reasonable distance of a railway
is being rapidly bought up, and the old Australian Company had
to convert about 80,000 acres of Bundure into Freehold, which,
as possessors of the Leasehold, they were enabled to do upon very
favourable terms. That property has always been one of the
best the Company had, and even with the additional cost for
converting the Leasehold into Freehold, it will yield a satis-
factory return, taking an average of the time since the Company
acquired it. In New Zealand, especially in what was the
province of Canterbury, the desire for buying land has been
such that there is now no first class land in that district to be
had from Government, and second and third class land, only fit


foi glazing, has been and up to the latest advices was still
being eagerly bought up. The Directors of the Canterbury
Association, having early seen that all good land suitable for
agricultural purposes would soon be bought up, took advantage
of the position they held, as occupiers of the Leasehold, to
conveit a large extent of it into Freehold, and the Company
now holds in Canterbury about 114,800 acres of the best land
in the province, and in Otago, about 200,000 acres, comprising
some of the richest land in the Middle Island. One great
cause for the demand for land is that it seems now established
that New Zealand wheat growers can command the British
market for their produce at an outlay in freight and charges
which leaves them on an average yield per acre a better
return than can be made from grazing only. The best quality
of the wheat is such as to sell at 2s. or 3s. per quarter higher
in oidinary seasons than the finest Essex, and considerably
above the finest Scotch wheat.
These facts will sufficiently account for the rush for Freehold
land, and you will be able to form your own opinion, Gentle-
men, what the future value of such land as this Company holds
is likely to be. What it is now in Canterbury the following
extract which I will read to you from Mr. Davidson’s letter by
last mail will explain much better than I could. Mr. Davidson,
as you are aware, is Superintendent of the old Association.
He says. I enclose an advertisement of a property sold on
the Island Run to give you an idea of how land is selling.
The improvements were utterly wretched in the way of build-
ings, but the fencing is fair. The land is somewhat rough in
one portion, but on the whole it is fair quality. The whole
fetched £lO 6s. per acre, with only a few months to pay it in,


and the purchaser said he would be willing to bid £ll per
acre for it. In the Levels Estate there are certainly 50,000
acres of as good quality as regards soil and situation, and by
making a fair allowance for the crops in the ground it will give
you a guide as to the present market value of said property.”
The land referred to as sold at auction at £lO 6s. per acre was
part of the Association’s Leasehold, but Mr. Davidson, by order
of the Directors, having selected as much as they resolved to
secure, allowed others to take what was left. As already
indicated, the Freehold Estate consists of 313,487 acres in the
Middle Island of New Zealand, and 87,231 acres in theßiverina
District of New South Wales, Australia. The possession of so
fine a property supplies the most solid basis for the operations of
the Company; it is, however, not without its drawbacks, as
time is required for development, and in the meantime it is a
drag upon the profits, as an adequate return cannot be made
from it for merely grazing purposes in its natural state. This
you will better understand when I mention that in New Zealand
in its natural state it takes an average of one and a half acres
to feed one sheep, and when improved it will carry an average
of two to three sheep to the acre.
Hitherto the Companies have had the whole of the land
in their own hands, but the time has now come, we believe,
when a new system has to be inaugurated in New Zealand.
It is quite impossible for any Company to work such large
Freehold properties as successfully as private individuals could
do in smaller holdings, or to develope them so rapidly as is
desirable in their own interests as well as for the good of the
Colony, and instructions have already been given for the survey
of a considerable extent of land, which it is proposed to lease to


good farmers for a series of years at a rent per annum with
apurchasing clause, i.e,, the right to the tenant topurchasethe land
at any time during the currency of his lease at so much per acre,
or by an annual payment of Principal and Interest sufficient to
redeem the price over a term of years. It is not for me to predict
what rent and price may he got. It will vary according to the
character of the land and its accessibility to market; but I may
mention that the Company has had an offer from a person
thoroughly acquainted with the land of 255. per acre per annum,
with a right of purchase at £25 per acre, for a portion of Totara;
and it has been communicated to us that the whole of Ard-
gowan may probably be leased in a very short time at an
average of 20s, per acre, per annum, with a purchasing clause
of perhaps £2O per acre. I instance these two places because
they are the first it has been decided upon to prepare for
leasing, and the knowledge of this in the Colony brought
out what I have just stated. Of course it will be under-
stood that all the land owned by the Company is not equal
to Totara and Ardgowan, but there is a large portion of it
that will give as good results in working, and that being the
case the value is only a matter of time, as population increases
and the country gets more opened up and developed. In the case
of Ardgowan it is a question whether we ought to give a right
of purchase to tenants, as that place hounds the town of Oamaru
on the west, and must some day become very valuable for feuing
purposes. Already for small lots up to £l5O to £2OO per acre
could be got, but of course it is not desirable to break upon it
for the sake of isolated sales until we are prepared to deal with
it as a whole, a matter which is now having the attention of
the Directors. It is not a fair test of value, but I may state that


the pipes of the Oamaru Water Works pass through this
place, for which purpose they acquired about 88 acres, consist-
ing principally of ridges and the less valuable portions
of the land, but the Government Surveyor, who was
the Arbiter, valued .it at equal to £23 Bs. per acre, besides
fencing the entire course, and giving the Company the right
of grazing over the surface of the land so purchased where
the water is carried underground, so that the Station suffers
little loss of feed by the sale.
The following figures, taken from the Statistics of the Colony,
will show you the steady progress of New Zealand :

and by the official returns there were 2,682,757 acres in
February, 1877.
The Cereals grown in 1867 were trifling, and in 1875-76 the
Wheat produced amounted to 2,863.619 bushels, Oats 6,357,431
bushels, and the Barley 993,219 bushels,

Our Government Blue Book for 187 G gives the following
particulars of the Cereals produced in the different Colonies
and Foreign Countries;—
From these figures, Gentlemen, you will observe the rapid
progress New Zealand is making and it is important to note,
as I daresay you have done, as bearing upon the prospective
value of land, that of all the Colonies and Countries named it is
at the top of the list for average production of Wheat per acre
(viz., 31-5- bushels); it may therefore be said to produce the


largest yield of Wheat per acre of any country in the world,
while it is the second for Barley bushels), and the third
for Oats (88 bushels). You will also notice that while the
number of Sheep has increased 38 per cent, the clip and value
of Wool has risen more than 50 per cent., which is to be
explained by the improvement of land and stock. To practical
men these returns will speak more forcibly than anything I
can say.
I have not considered it necessary to point out to you the
very favourable character of the climate of New Zealand,
because I take it for granted that that is now universally
admitted, and it is confirmed in the best of all ways by the
produce of its soil as I have just brought before you.
I may mention that the Directors consider it desirable to
increase the number of the Members of the Board, and they
hope to succeed in securing the services of Gentlemen who will
be approved of by the Shareholders.
With these remarks, Gentlemen, I beg to move the adoption
of the Balance Sheet and Directors’ Report.
Mr. William Couper having seconded the motion, which was
unanimously agreed to, Mr. David M'Cowan said : —“ Before
this meeting is closed, allow me to say, Mr. Chairman, that I
regret so few of the Shareholders are present to-day to have
heard the interesting and important remarks with which you
prefaced the motion for the adoption of the Report. lam sure
all of us have listened with great satisfaction to the information
you have given regarding the growth, progress, and prospects
of the Company; and I think it is only right that the absent
Shareholders should also be put in possession of it. Subject


therefore to your approval, I beg to move that the observations
of the Chairman be printed and circulated amongst the Share-
holders.”
Mr. M'Cowan’s motion was unanimously adopted, and,
a vote of thanks being proposed to the Chairman, the
meeting terminated.
