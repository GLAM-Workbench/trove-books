VERSES
A Soldier’s Dream of Home
On a shattered field of battle,
By a camp-fire gleaming bright,
There a soldier-boy lies dreaming
Of his home, sweet home, to-night.
He can see the blue-ridg’d mountains
Of Australia’s sunny shore;
He can see the golden wattle
Blooming by the old home door.
He can hear the bush-bird singing,
Oh, how happy there he seems;
Tho’ on a field of battle,
At home in a land of dreams!
All the world’s in bloom before him,
Not a vision of cruel war;
All are scenes of peace and gladness,
As they were to him before.
As he dreams of his dear mother,
Tho’ so far across the main,
In his dream he softly murmurs:
I am with you once again.
That sweet dream of home is over,
He has bid them all good-bye,
As again he slowly wakens,
From his heart there comes a sigh.
For the scenes he loved have left him—
They are fading o’er the foam!
Just a dream of tender memories,
That’s a soldier’s dream of home.


Down at Monte Vidio.
Down at Monte Vidio, near Weymouth by the sea,
I was camped with many others, waiting quite
impatiently
For a boat to start from Blighty, the land of rain
and fog,
To transport us to Aussy, our home, the land of
God.
We attend parade each morning; you will hear the
sergeant shout:
“Now, men. just pay attention; the boat roll I’ll
read out—
“99407 Smith, 3140 Jones,”
He calls us alphabetically, from the missed ones
there comes groans.
“Shun!” at last it’s over, he’ll then dismiss parade—
The cripples charge the Y.M.C.A.,
Charge like the Light Brigade.
A Tribute to Our Red Cross Sisters.
In this world’s great war,
We have heroes by the score,
In the Billjims who are fighting at the front.
And our lads in. navj l - blue
On the sea will see us through,
And from the ocean waves our foes will hunt.
When a battle’s over,
There are wounded men, of course,
Then our heroines start fighting,
Fighting ’neath the bright Red Cross—
Fighting grim death, with his terrors,
Soothing poor Billjim’s last hours.
Thank God for these noble women,
These glorious sisters of ours.
In their uniform so neat
They always look a treat,
Do these girls who tend our wounded at the front.
Their praises Billjim sings.


They’re his angels- without wings,
For better girls the wide world you will hunt
And when the war is over
And the boys come home at last,
And all good people cheering
As the lads go marching past—
Then give three cheers for the nurses
Who work with the boys hand in hand;
Thank God for these noble women,
Thank God for the Red Cross Band.
What Do You Think of Mother?
Nobody knows but mother! .
I think that’s the bards lay ;
It must be written by some other —
Not one of those sons who’s away.
Nobody knows but mother.
Tq me. it’s a selfish refrain;
What of those sons of that mother
Who struggle to give her their gain?
Nobody knows but mother.
But what of her boys far away
Who only respect a woman
Because mother is built that way.
Nobody cares but mother
But of the best and the worst,
How many prayers have been uttered
For the mother who gave us birth?
Nobody knows but mother!
Who wrote that poem was mad,
For if nobody cares but mother,
Then all of us must be bad.
Mother, your sons always think some,
And whenever in pain, call for you;
Whoever thinks different —a bad ’un—
How bad your sons only knew.


Mother, We Meet Again.
Why are you sad, dear mother?
Ah, why should you worried be?
The same blessed Providence, mother,
Is ever watching over me.
Think of- these words, dear mother;
Hope is my guiding star;
Claim, it as yours, dear mother,
While I am from you far.
My thoughts are ever turning—
To you they seem to roam;
And my heart is ever yearning
For the quiet scenes of home.
Tho’ on a field of battle,
Do you think I once forget
The sun bird and the wattle?—
Memories that cheer me yet.
I fancy thou aft near me.
And I often breathe a sigh,
When a comrade scarce can hear me
And the winds alone reply.
Oft do my home-thoughts wander,
Over the restless main;
And in your ear I whisper:
“Mother, we meet again!”
JIM!
We were mates, were Jim and I,
Mates right from the start —
From when we went to camp together,
Until he fell, shot through the heart.
We joined the same battalion ;
We trained at Seymour Camp;
And many the weary mile we marched
Through mud and snow and damp.


We had finished up our training,
And were ordered to the front;
To join the boys out here in France,
And help to bear the brunt.
We were sitting in our dug-out,
A-yarning of olden times,
When the order came to “Stand to.
We were wanted down the lines.
At last the scrap was over—
Just a scrimmage, that was all—
We never even stopped one,
Though we saw others round us fall
We were sitting in a dug-out —
Just a hole dug in the ground.
With a roof made out of sandbags.
To keep the bullets oflf. flying round
It was one morning in December,
We were fighting in the snow,
And it wasn’t the kind of fighting
That you see on the picture show.
We were sitting in a shell-hole,
Out there, in “No Man’s Land,”
Waiting for the signal to go
At ’em, man for man.
We hopped in his front line trenches
And were bombing side by side,
When a sniper’s bullet chopped him—
That’s how my cobber died.
He was just a rough Australian.
One the Frenchies’ call “Tres bon,”
And I miss him something awful.
And I’m lonely now he’s gone.
Although I’m badly wounded —
Perhaps I’ll fight no more—
We’ve done our best together;
Good-bye. Jimmy. “Au revoir.”


A Soldier’s Farewell.
Farewell, dear Australia, the land of our birth;
Farewell to the loved ones, our homes and our
hearth;
No more the sweet wattle, all laden with gold;
For one glimpse of its beauty we’d love to behold.
Now sails the big transport far over the sea,
Three cheers for Australia, the land of the free;
If ever we return to your bright, sunny shore.
It will be when our fighting is needed no more.
Farewell, dear Australia, it may be for a while—
It may be for ever, our dear, sunny isle;
No matter, our loved land, wherever we be
We’ll fight for yon, honour and liberty.
Then cheer for us, pray for us. help us to win.
For our home and our country, for kith and for kin;
Good-bye, dear Australia, until we return
To the land of the emu, the wattle and fern.
The Boy Who Went Away.
There’s a mother somewhere thinking—
Thinking of her son to-day;
Whilst for us he’s bravely fighting
In the thickest of the fray.
How her heart fills up with sorrow,
As the postman leaves the gate,
Knowing not what’s in the letter—
Be it glad news or be it fate!
On her careworn brow there’s sorrow;
It has claimed its resting place
Where red roses once were blooming
On her kind and gentle face,
As she kneels alone in silence,
Just to lisp a fervent prayer
That God on high may shield her son
On a battlefield somewhere.


Oft in fancy there she sees him-
Through each sad and lonely day,
As he was when just a baby
Nestling by her side to play.
But it’s just the cause of fancy
For we know that he’s not there;
When the brave are fiercely fighting
He has gone to do his share.
With the heart’s love of their country,
Victory glowing on each face,
Like this boy who left his mother.
Other mother’s sons you’ll trace.
From death’s ranks muffled war-drums
He’ll come marching home some day.
When you’re not the slightest thinking
Of the boy who went away.
The Parting.
Dear little love, don’t fret,
’Tis best that I should go,
At the Empire’s call.
To stand or fall
Against this treacherous foe;
You know I shan’t forget,
So, dear little love, don’t fret.
Dear little eyes, don’t weep,
It fills my soul with pain
To see you cry;
For, look! the sky
Has a rainbow in the rain;
And death is only sleep:
So, dear little eyes, don’t weep.
Dear little heart, don’t break,
For should the fates decree
That I no -more
See Australia’s shore, :
Then truly say of me.
“I died for England’s sake.”
So, dear little heart, don’t break.


On Conscription.
Conscription was the cry.'
The boys want reinforcements;
Yes, they do/’twixt you and I!
Still, if they won’t come freely.
They’d better stay away
I’m sure they will feel sorry.
They will be ashamed some day.
Conscription was the cry.
Our girls want reinforcements;
Yes, they do, ’Uvixt you and I!
See them in our hospitals
With the wounded lying round;
Twelve hours, and often over,
To their duty they are bt und.
Always kind and cheerful.
Helping us bear our pain,
Skilfully tending the wounded.
Always playing the game.
Australia is proud of her soldiers;
Let her be proud of her sisters, too.
If you reinforce the soldiers
They will stand reinforcing, too!
Inspection Day By the D.D.M.S.,
First A.G.H., Rouen, France.
Wednesday again! Oh dear, oh lor!
We’ve all been washed and scrubbed the floor;
The beds all draped with sheets so clean,
Each patient done up like a dream.
The stove is polished, the tins as well,
Our lockers cleaned, they look quite swell;
The Sisters, too. look really sweet,
In nice clean pinnies, they’re a treat.
The Orderlies are all alert, ;
Searching the ward for specks of dirt;
From hidden corners of the ward >; t
Pot plants are brought to grace the board.


For it is Wednesday, the great day the D.D.M.S,
Will pass this way,
And if all is well, why then, of course,
Our Sister gets the Royal Red Cross.
But judge our anguish and our woe
The hours drag on; how slow they go!
He never came, our hearts are broke,
For hours our Sister never spoke.
She said, at last, she’d learn to swear—
I sincerely hope I’ll not he there.
I’ll end this, tale—the end, you know,
Is d the D.D.M.S. and the D.S.O.
Farewell to a V.A.D. Hospital, Hironcourt,
Boscombe.
Dear Hironcourt, farewell to thee!
Thy stately halls no more I’ll see.
Or the fair lady of the Manor;
’Twas good to live beneath her banner.
Good-bye, broad lands, secluded nooks,
No more I’ll see your running brooks.
Walls have ears, so we are to’d;
If they could speak what tales unfold
Of knightly deeds not long at rest —
Sheltering our wounded was the best.
Good-bye, dear sister, who is in charge,
To see our boys don’t roam at large;
To get him well and free from pain,
’Tis sad to think we will never meet again.
Then there is the lady who’s the quarter,
Whose cheerful ways make days much shorter;
And all the nurses who so kind,
’Tis sad to leave them all behind.
When I am far across the sea,
Fair Hironcourt, I’ll think of thee.
Once morq, adieu! My thanks I tend;
Good luck to all! With that I’ll end.


Where Our Soldier Brother Lies.
Far off in lonely “No Man’s Land,”
It was there he fought and fell;
His life he gave, your life to save,
That, you know, we need not tell.
Dear to our hearts ever he’ll be,
Tho’ he’s gone for evermore;
As long as life and memory last
Could you picture what he bore?
Beyond the great dividing range,
There his spirit lies to-day;
In peace, with other souls that fought
In the battle far away.
In freedom’s cause there, side by side,
He did his duty well:
Until a piece of shrapnel caused
Him to bid farewell.
The sun will shine,
Stars will twinkle from the skies;
Far away, on a lonely grave,
Where my soldier brother lies.
Before I Joined Up.
Time flies, the world rolls on—
It seems but yesterday that I was twenty-one.
My life, like many more, has been misspent,
Unthinking, struggling, to make a fortune bent
Dame Fortune I courted with manv a sigh;
She seldom smiled, she passed me by.
The years pass by—perhaps a score—
At times a happy month, but never more.
Perhaps it’s well! I’ve neither wife nor chick
To share my sorrow, to see me sick.
How sad it seems, as I look back,
And count the many failures on. the track.
Far from my home my life I’ve spent;


Too late, too- late to now repent.
Hopeless I live—l’ve ceased tp pray—
How long- a night! How dark the way!
Perhaps the God I used to know
Will guide my footsteps when I go,
And in His mercy He may guide
My erring soul, where friends abide.
My 1 ife has passed like some bad dream,
The pain it caused He may have seen.
Father, mother, sister dear,
My brothers, too, I sadly fear.
I’ll see no more upon this earth.
Or see the land which gave me birth.
But why repine? My time’s not up;
I’ll make things hum if I win the Cup.
The Funeral.
“Fall in A, fall in R.
Fall in, ev’ry Company.”
We was ’avin’ our scran w’en the ’serribly brayed,
An’ we grumbled a curse or two, ,
As we buckled an’ buttoned, an’ rushed" op parade,
With our grub only ’arf-way thro’.
“Serrymonial Drill !” barked the W. 0.,
An’ a square-an-alk curse we” gave,
For a funeral march we wass booked to go, ■
To foller some bloke to ’is grave.
An’ we stepped it out to a ragtime strain,
As the band played a lively air.
An’ we'all filed inter the waitin’ train, .
An’ started for Gawd knows where.
Aik we yarned an’ smoked, an’ was rushed to town,
W’ere we squeezed thro’ the peerin’ throng,
An’ the cold-footers screwed with a sneerin’ frown,
At our push uv a ’undred strong.
An’ we come to the ’alt at a dingy shop
With a undertaker’s sign. . ..« ;
Near a likely pub., an’ a serious cop


Was keepin’ the crowd in line. ,
“Guard, pree-sent ums!” They lumbered it out
To the shabby old waitin’ ’earse,
Then: “Guard, slow march!” an’ we wheeled about
An’ the band in the lead, with the drums in black,
Was wailin’ th’ March in “Saul,”
An’ we come next, an’ away at the back.
With arms at the gloomin’ reverse,
Was the ’earse. an’ the cause uv it all.
An’ miles we crawled down the dusty road,
Past many a temptin’ pub,
An’ rifle an’ web made a dinkum load
W’en we’d only ’ad ’arf our grub.
At last we come to the boneyard gates,
W’ere the green trees meet above.
An’ there in ’is surplice the chaplain waits,
As meek as a suckin’ dove.
An’ we lines the track with our ’eads bowed low,
An’ our rifles upside down,
An’ the pilot leads the ’earse dead slow,
Between our ranks uv brown.
Then we closes in an’ we follers ’im,
With about two score uv kids,
An’ we crunches th’ gravelly path, trim,
An’ th’ sex’ons lift their lids
Then, “Earth to Earth.” an’ the kiddies squeeze
For a look-in on either flank;
An’ we scared the sparrers from off th’ trees
W’en we fired our three rounds blank.
An’ the Last Post echoed around th’ flat
With a mournful kinder sound,
Then we sprinted away at a lively bat,
Quick march from th’ burying ground.
An’ the band struck up, “Red, W’ite an’ Blue,”
An’ we sang, an’ th’ civies stared;
But the name uv the corpse, there was none uv us
knew;
An’ blanky few uv us cared!

The Books; Christmas on the Somme, 1916.
Out on the Somme, on Christmas Eve, Oh, didn’t
we have some fun!
A few miles back from the firing line—not far from
the fearful Hun.
Though probably never heard of in books, we’re an
army of cooks,
Our names are not handed to fame;
Though our start was bad, we were not sad
We had Christmas just the same.
There was an issue of rum, to start the fun,
You bet we got our share;
And one sergeant cook was brought to book,
With some "cham.” as lie took the chair.
He smiled as he called one of the boys,
“Teddie Birchell” by name—
He sang a song, with the words all wrong.
And he got there just the same.
Then Charlie and Joe sang a song, I don’t know,
About Harry and the Parrie, you see!
Then another tot, and we talked a lot.
By Jove! ’twas a jolly old spree.
Bill, a corporal cook, a job had took,
Cooking hens for some of the boys.
He introduced some beer, and we drank good cheer,
To the Twelfth, and made more noise.
Then Private John Rees, we nearly squeezed,
For a song, but he wouldn’t come;
Then the Chaplain Chap filled up the gap;
To the concert we must run.
I’d promised to play, to make things gay,
And Sid, he’d promised to sing.
So away we went, and some time was spent
At the concert —a horrible thing!
Then we hurried back on the muddy track,
Got our braziers burning bright;
Then two Scottish friends, some Scotch songs read.
By Jove, ’twas a jolly good night.


Then we went to sleep—let no soldier greet
At the Christmas Eve we had.
At the break of dawn, without bugle or horn.
We arise, poor Charlie and me;
Went to see a friend, I won’t pretend.
Disappointed both were we.
My duty to fulfil, and time to kill,
My comrades 1 must call;
The bugler you'll agree I had to see,
The first man I must call.
I found a tent, I ma'de an attempt
The inmate to awake;
1 got a shock when I found a Captain I’d started
to shake.
In the officers’ mess I got a surprise,
Make me feel gay and frisky,
So help me bob! right on the knob
Was a bottle of jolly good whisky.
So we must confess, through all the mess,
While the world’s great battle rages,
We army cooks, like good old crooks,
Kept Christmas and earned their wages.
Leave.
A wandering thought, a tender heart,
Is that which gives the pain,
As duty calls a life abroad
To baffle wind and rain.
Yes. here in France, we’! l have to stay
We mean to stay, that’s more—
Unless the Huns will meet our views,
And all our rights restore.
For months we’ve toiled, and still go on,
And wonder all the while,
When we can tread the muddy road.
That carries—yes, a smile?


At last the message comes along,
Imagine our delight,
To think at last we’re homeward bound—
A refuge in our plight.
We pack our relics safe and sound,
And swing along with glee,
To catch the first train of the night
That takes us to the sea.
We’re off, it matters not how long
Before the journey back;
We nestle in the carriage
Of the big smoke on the track.
It crawls through space towards the
It fails to know our need
To get away from Flanders,
For a week, at lightning speed.
The engines speak, we glide along
With God’s good luck and speed.
We place a life-belt round our waist.
In case of any need.
Then shortly after the haze appears;
What can it really be?
A steep incline of whiteness,
With its face towards the sea.
Eight days of joy and gladness,
Eight days of joy and bliss;
How sweet to see one’s parents,
And to feel their good-night kiss!
No shells are bursting round us,
Our ears hear not the guns;
And thanks to England’s navy,
We need not fear the Huns.


Anzacs.
What mean these great white ships at sea,
Ploughing their eastward track,
Bearing their mangled human freight,
Bringing the spent men back?
They mean that Australia has been there,
They mean she has played the game,
And her wonderful sons have won their share
Of everlasting fame.
Battered and worn and war-scarred —
Those who had left their land
Strong in their glowing manhood,
By England to take their stand.
Those who had sailed, when the war cloud burst,
Out on a distant foam,
To the tune of “Australia Will , be There”—
Thus are they coming home !
What mean these absent numbers—
The gaps in the stricken line?
You will find the graves which tel! you,
On the trail by Lonesome Pine.
On the slope of Tki Baba,
On Koja Chemen’s brow,
They died the death of heroes,
As Australia’s sons know how.
Eager for battle, they leapt ashore
At the cove where their name was won.
They stormed the cliffs at Sari Bair,
Where the death-trap gullies run;
In the lead-rent scrub at Krithia,
On the banks of the Kereves Dere,
High on the shell-swept ridges—
Australia has been there.


There is silence on the beaches now,
The battle-din has fled
From the gullies, cliffs and ridges,
Where they charged up, fought and bled
There’s a little cove that’s sacred—
North of Gaba Tepe Hill—
To the glory of the men who died.
And a name that never will!
And now on the fields of Flanders
'Tis eternised once more,
At Polygon Wood and Broodseinde,
Bapaumc and Bullecourt,
At Pozieres, Armentieres, Messines,
By the frozen Somme and Aisne,
In the snow-clad front-line trenches —
Australia is there again.
There are great white vessels sailing,
And they bear the joy and pain.
And the glory of Australia’s sons.
Who have not bled in vain.
Tho’ crippled, helpless, maimed for life,
Tho’ more than death their loss,
There is more than life in the glory
Of the burden of their cross.
Greater than jewel-decked emperor.
Greater than ermined king.
Clad in their faded suits of blue.
The men that the white ships bring;
What tho’ their crown a bandage,
Stretcher or cot their throne;
Splints or a crutch their sceptre—
The ANZAC name is their own !

after hearing a wealthy merchant speak disparagingly
of Australians.)
We are not cotton-spinners all, but some love England
. and her honour yet.”
We stand on the shore of Durban
And watch the transports go
To England from Australia,
Hurrying to and fro,
Bearing the men of a Nation —
Who are heroes to the core—
To stand or fall by the Motherland —
And they’re sending thousands more.
We’ve watched the ships returning
With the cripple and the maim,
With limbs that trail and falter;
Theirs an immortal name.
The deathless name of “Anzac”
That thrills from Pole to Pole;
The remnants of the hedoes
On the long and glorious roll.
And now in their tens of hundreds
Come the men to fill their ranks,
And what can we do to show them
Our love, our pride, our thanks ?
We can’t do much (I own it),
But give them a passing cheer;
While the real elite beat a shocked retreat —
Why, they saw one drinking beer!
O God, could we show these misers
The path that the Anzacs went!
Gould they rest in their beds at night-time ?
Or live in their damned content?
Gould they talk with a sneer of Australians
When one or two get drunk?
I’d rather a drunk Australian
Than a wealthy Durban funk!


He’s a better man than you are.
You dear teetotal saint!
You do not drink—you will not fight!'
What wonderful restraint!
We stand on the shore of Durban,
For we’re not all made like you,
And the glorious name of “Anzac’’
Thrills us thro’ and thro’!
But all we can do is to cheer them,
And throw them an orange from the shore.
We’re not millionaires (like some are),
Or perhaps we would try to do more.
They’re coming in tens of thousands,
And here’s to their honour to-day—
Here’s to the Sister Dominion,
Who is showing us the way!

God Send You Back.
“God send you hack to me,”
It’s a fascinating song.
God send me back to you,
Somehow the words are wrong,
God send us Lack to you;
Somehow, it is strange,
Now we are back with you,
All things are changed.
We crossed the mighty deep,
Passed hidden foes.
How many more will come,
God only knows.
