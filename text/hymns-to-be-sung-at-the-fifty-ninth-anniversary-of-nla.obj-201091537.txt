MORNING.
Whither , Pilgritns, are you going.
VX THITHER, pilgrims, are you going,
■ * Going each with staff in hand ?
We are going on a journey,
Going at our King's command.
Over hills, and plains, and valleys,
We are going to His palace,
We are going to His palace,
Going to the better land.
Tell us, pilgrims, what you hope for
In that far-off better land ?
Spotless robes, and crowns of glory,
From a Saviour's loving hand.
We shall drink of life’s clear river,
We shall dwell with God for ever,
We shall dwell with God for ever,
In that bright, that better land.
Pilgrims, may we travel with you
To that bright and better land ?
Come and welcome, come and welcome,
Welcome to our pilgrim band.
Come, oh come, and do not leave us ;
Christ is waiting to receive us,
Christ is waiting to receive us,
In that bright, that better land.


Te Deuin.
V\7E praise Thee, O God : we acknowledge Thee
' * to be the Lord. All the earth doth worship
Thee : the Father e-ver-lasting. To Thee all
Angels cry aloud : the Heavens and all the powers
there-in. To Thee Che-ru-bin and Se-ra-phin: con-
tin-ual-ly do cry, Holy, Holy, Holy : Lord God of
Sa-baoth ; Heaven and earth are full of the majesty :
of Thy Glory. The glorious company of the
Apostles : praise Thee, The goodly fellowship of
the Prophets : praise Thee. The no-ble army of
Martyrs: praise Thee. The Holy Church through-
out all the world : doth acknowledge Thee, The
Father ;of an infinite majesty ; Thine honourable,
true : and only Son ; Also the Holy Ghost: the Com-
forter. Thou art the King of Glory : O Christ. Thou
art the everlasting Son :of the Father. When Thou
tookest upon Thee to deliver man : Thou did’st not
abhor the Virgin’s womb. When Thou hadst over-
come the sharpness of death : Thou did’st open the
kingdom of heaven to all believers. Thou sittest
at the right hand of God : in the glory of the Father.
We believe that Thou shall come : to be our Judge.
We therefore pray Thee help Thy servants : whom
Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious Blood.
Make them to be numbered with Thy Saints : in
glory everlasting. O Lord save Thy people : and
bless Thine heritage. Govern them : and lift them
up for ever. Day by day ; we magnify Thee ; And
we worship Thy Name : ever world without end.
Vouchsafe, 0 Lord : to keep us this day without sin.
Lord, have mercy upon us : have mercy upon us.
0 Lord, let Thy mercy lighten upon us : as our trust
is inThee. O Lord in Thee, in Thee have I trusted ;
let me never be confounded.


Jubilate Deo.
/~\H be joyful in the Lord, all ye lands : serve the
Lord with gladness and come before His pre-
sence with a song. Be ye sure that the Lord He is
God ; it is He that hath made us, and not we our-
selves : we are His people and the sheep of His
pasture. Ogo your way into His gates with thanks-
giving, and into His courts with praise : be thank-
ful unto Him, and speak good of His name. For
the Lord is gracious, His mercy is everlasting : and
His truth endureth from generation to generation.
Glory, Glory, Glory, be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the be-
ginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end.
Amen.
More Love to Thee , O Christ.
TV/T ORE love to Thee, O Christ,
IVx More love to Thee !
Hear Thou the prayer I make
On bended knee :
This is my earnest plea—
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee !
Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek,
Give what is best :
This all my prayer- shall be—
More love, O Christ to Thee !
More love to Thee!
Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise :
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise—
This still its prayer shall be—
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee.

He rose.
HE rose, He rose, He rose, He rose,
He rose, He rose, He rose, He rose,
He rose, He rose from the dead ;
He rose,JHe rose from the dead ;
He rose, He rose from the dead;
The Lord will bear his people home.
I’ve found a joy in sorrow,
A secret balm for pain,
A beautiful to-morrow
Of sunshine after rain ;
I’ve found a branch of healing
Near every bitter spring,
A whispered promise stealing
O’er every broken string,
I’ve found a glad hosannah
For every woe and wail;
A handful of sweet manna
When grapes of Eshcol fail;
I’ve found a Rock of Ages
When desert wells are dry ;
And after weary stages,
I’ve found an Elim nigh.
An Elim with its coolness,
Its fountains and its shade ;
A blessing in its fulness,
When buds of promise fade.
O’er tears of soft contrition
I’ve seen a rainbow light
A glory and fruition,
So near!—yet out of sight.
My Saviour, Thee possessing,
I have the joy, the balm,
The healing and the blessing,
The sunshine and the psakr*
The promise for the fearful
The Elim for the faint,
The rainbow for the tearfnl,
The glory for the saint


O Love divine , how sweet thou art!
OLOVE divine, how sweet Thou art!
When shall I find my willing heart
All taken up by thee ?
I thirst, I faint, I die to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
The love of Christ to me !
Stronger His love than death or hell ;
Its riches are unsearchable ;
The first-born sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see,
They cannot reach the mystery,
The length, and breadth, and height.
God only knows the love of God ;
O that it now were shed abroad
In this poor stony heart !
For love I sigh, for love I pine :
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
Be mine this better part!
O that I could for ever sit
With Mary at the Master’s feet !
Be this my happy choice :
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my heaven on earth, be this,
To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.
Easter Anthem.
CHRIST from the dead is raised and made the
first fruits of the tomb. For since by man came
death, by man did the resurrection come. Christ
being raised by power divine, and rescued from the
grave, shall die no more ; death shall in Him no
more dominion have.
Lift up your heads, ye gates unfold, to entertain
the King of Glory ; see He comes with His celes-
tial train. Who is the King of glory, who ? The
Lord of Hosts is He, who o’er sin, death, and hell
hath gained for us the victory, Hallelujah. Amen.
EVENING.


The Foe behind , the Deep before.
THE foe behind, the deep before,
Our hosts have dared and passed the sea :
And Pharaoh’s warriors strew the shore,
And Israel’s ransomed tribes are free.
Lift up, lift up your voices now !
The whole wide world rejoices now !
The Lord hath triumphed gloriously!
The Lord shall reign victoriously !
Happy morrow,
Turning sorrow
Into peace and mirth!
Bondage ending,
Love descending
O’er the earth!
Seals assuring,
Guards securing,
Watch his earthly prison.
Seals are shattered,
Guards are scattered
Christ hath risen !
No longer must the mourners weep,
Nor call departed Christians dead ;
For death is hallowed into sleep,
And every grave becomes a bed.
Now once more
Eden’s door
Open stands to mortal eyes ;
For Christ hath risen, and man shall rise !
Now at last,
Old things past,
Hope, and joy, and peace begin ;
For Christ hath won, and man shall win!
It is not exile, rest on high :
It is not sadness, peace from strife ;
To fall asleep is not to die :
To dwell with Christ is better life.


Where our banner leads us,
We may safely go :
Where our Chief precedes us,
We may face the foe.
His right arm is o’er us,
He our guide will be :
Christ hath gone before us,
Christians, follow ye !
Rock of Ages, cleft for me.
"D OCK of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee ;
Let the water and the blood
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure.
Could my tears for ever flow,
Could my zeal no languor know,
These for sin could not atone ;
Thou must save and Thou alone :
In my hand no price I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
