This Poem was suggested by the following remarkable story,
:?
\ �
illustrative of the length of time human beings can exist without
"'7 . �
w.
, < - ? y ',
nourishment, which reached England by the Australian Mail
.#? l ' ' " *
in November, 1864: ??Some weeks back, at the station of a Mr.
??.' J > ? '
t . -
Dugald Smith, at Horsham, two boys and a girl, aged respectively
the eldest boy nine, the girl seven, and the youngest boy five,
t ' *': r ?
the children of a carpenter named Duff, wandered by themselves
into the bush and were lost. They had been sent out by their
\ ? * j
mother, as they had often gone out on the same errand before, to
gather broom; and not returning before dark, the parents became
alarmed and a search commenced. The father, assisted by
\
friends and neighbours in large numbers, scoured the country in
\
every direction for nights and days in vain. At length, in
despair, the assistance of some aboriginal blacks was obtained,
these people possessing an almost bloodhound instinct in following
\
�
i
up the very faintest tracks. The blacks sdon came upon the
traces of the little wanderers, expatiating, as these trackers
? (T
always do, at every bent twig or flattened tuft of grass, on the
apparent actings of the objects of their search. ?Here, little one
tired; sit down. Big one kneel down, carry him along. Hero
travel all night; dark; not see that bush; her fall on him.?
Eurther on, and more observations. ? Here little one tired again;


big one kneel down; no able to rise; fall flat on his face.? The
accuracy of these readings of the blacks was afterwards curiously
corroborated by the children themselves. On the eighth day
after they were lost, and long after the extinction of the faintest
hope of their ever been again seen alive, the searching party came
on them. They are described as having been found lying all of
a row on a clump of broom among some trees, the youngest in
the middle carefully wrapped in his sister?s frock. They
appeared to be in a deep and not unpleasant sleep. - On being
awoke, the eldest tried to sit up, but fell back. His face was so
emaciated that his lips would not cover his teeth, and he could
only just feebly groan ?Father.? The youngest, who had suffered
least, woke up as from a dream, child-like demanding, ? Father,
why didn?t you come for us sooner? we were cooeying for you.?
The sister, who was almost quite gone, when lifted up, could only
murmur, ?Cold, cold.? No wonder, as the little creature had
stripped herself of her frock, as the elder boy said, ?to cover
Frank, for he was crying with cold.? The children have all since
done well, and are rapidly recovering. They were -without food,
and, by their own account, had only one drink of water during
the whole time they were out, and this was from the Friday of
one week until the Saturday of the next week, in all nine days
and eight nights.? ?Daily Telegraph, November 18 1864.

LOST IN THE BUSH:
4
i
Th? Australian sun, with bright and gorgeous blaze,
Slowly descends, shedding rich crimson rays
Over the distant, clear, and silver lake,
Where wearied cattle love their thirst to slake.
The settler, who all day must wandering roam,
Returns delighted to his log-built home,
Is welcomed by those blessings of his life,
His fair-haired children and his loving wife.
On such an evening, while the sunset light
Still tinged the edge of yonder distant height,
Three little children all set off in glee
To gather wood beneath the forest tree.
s
I
i!
if


9
Oft had they gone, and oft returned before,
Bringing of broom and wood an ample store.
The mother saw them go, nor felt alarm ;
She thought not, dreamt not, they could suffer harm;
But busily prepared the evening meal,
While the slow shadows o?er the landscape steal.
The father from his toilsome work returns;
Within the hut the cheerful firelight burns;
The hot and tempting suppers steaming wait,
Each in the little one?s own fav?rite plate.
The mother turns, then says with anxious gaze,
? They ne?er have been so late on other days! ?
O?er the fond Tattler?s brow a shadow crossed,
?My precious ones, they surely are not lost!?
Then rising, they approach the open door,
And wonder they ne?er felt alarm before.
The forest birds to rest are slowly flying,
Departing daylight?s last faint ray is dying:
The parents shout ?no answer from the wood ;
Sad fears crept o?er them as they trembling stood.
Tears fill the mother?s eyes; both fond hearts yearn,
\
To see their darlings safely home return.

LOST IN THE BUSH.


Evening?s calm shadows deepen into night,
From a grey cloud shines forth the moon?s pale light;
?Tis gladly welcomed by the sorrowing pair;
There?s nought the father will not do, or dare,
v
j
To bring safe back the loved and wand?ring three,
If his dear wife will wait, and patient be.
He calls the watch-dog, who with joyous bark
Springs forward to the distant forest dark;
The mother watches them with straining eyes,
Then, turning homewards, sadly weeps and sighs.
/
Ho happy children meet her at the door;
Oh! Will she ever look upon them more ?
What if they strayed into the forest wild,
By curious flowers, and insects strange beguiled,
Wand?ring still farther, and yet farther on,
Until they found the daylight almost gone;
u
Then, turning, tried in vain to find their way,
And wildly searching went still more astray.
These thoughts, and many more of dreary kind,
Flitted through that poor lonely mother?s mind,
As, looking through th? uncurtained window pane
With swollen eyes, she watches still in vain
A : K


%
i
6
'
K
A
For those loved forms emerging from the shade
Of the wild bush and deep entangled glade.
For ever and anon, with watchful ear,
She fancies she hears sounds of voices near;
? ?Tis they,? she thinks, ?my darling children come!
\
Their father brings them safely back to home.?
What joy to clasp them to my heart once more,
And feel that all their dangers now are o?er;
But no, ?tis false, she finds herself deceived,
And the dull load of care still unrelieved.
Thus passed the first long hours of her sad grief
Yet still she tried to cherish the belief
That tho? in sorrow deep she passed the night,
Joy would return with the first dawn of light.
Oh, blessed hope! Without thee this dull earth
Would ne?er hear sound of cheerfulness or mirth;
*
Desponding man, alas! would sink and die,
Nor look for happiness beneath the sky.
This earth would be a wilderness of tears,
i
An orb of woe! of mourning, and of fears.


The fleecy clouds are fringed with rosy red,
Where the sun, rising from his eastern bed,
Prepares to run his brilliant daily round,
And shed his light o?er earth?s remotest bound;
Gladly the watcher saw his beams appear,
They gave fresh hope to one so lone and drear.
Then, with a busy care and loving thought,
The morning meal she soon prepared and brought;
Her choicest dainties on the table laid,
To welcome back the darlings who had strayed.
Sudden she heard the watch-dog?s well known voice ;
Oh ! How it caused her sad heart to rejoice!
She rushes to the door. ? Come, come to me !
Oh! Give me back my lost, my darling three! ?
The only answer was a stifled moan;
Her husband crossed the threshold, ?but alone.
v
She sinks and utters a heart-rending wail,
.*
While the poor father tells his mournful tale :
? He?d sought them through the dreary hours of night
In every quarter, to the left and right;
A
**
Kind sympathising friends had lent their aid,
And hunted with him thro? the deepest shade;
r< k


Yet not the slightest trail, or faintest trace,
Could any find in that bewildering place;
Until, as morning broke, their strength was spent,
And homeward, with sad footsteps, each one went.
Yet, when refreshed with one short hour of rest,
They?d start again, and all would do their best
To seek the lost ones in the forest gloom,
And rescue them from such a dreadful doom;
i
The thick-entangled bush they would explore,
Where none had ventured on the day before.?
i
Thus with sad fears the husband tried to cope;
;
And in the mother?s breast raise sinking hope;
But thro? his mind sad thoughts began to creep,
\ \
Fears for the wanderers in those mazes deep.
A second time they started, and once more,
With streaming eyes, she watched them from the door.
i
�
Her wish had been to aid the search as well ;
. * "
i i
The father said, ? ?Twere best not ?who can tell ?
,
Perchance they have not wandered far away,
i
*
And may to home return with early day.?
And so she stayed, but, as the dull hours lengthen,
??. ! ?
?
t *?, *
Each spark of hope dies out, and sad fears strengthen.
\
t


She waits and watches, yet no welcome sound
Announces the giad news that they are found;
And once again the sun sinks in the west,
And leaves her still unhappy and distressed.
The still earth slumbers, and the silent stars
Look down in pity through the window bars.
The hours crawl slowly on; when each is passed,
It seems e?en longer than the dreary last.
; > * ' '' * ? V I
At length, by weight of grief and troubling thought,
: y ? jK* f r
Her woman?s nature is quite overwrought;
A
A drowsy feeling o?er her whole frame creeps,
Her head sinks downwards, and at last she sleeps.
, * f ?- ? r.
The solemn twilight of that fearful night
Melts into summer?s morning, pure and bright;
�
The moon?s rays pale before the growing beams
Of the rich sunlight, and yet still she dreams.
Sweet, gentle sleep! Thou soother of mankind,
When bitter sorrow weighs upon the mind,
Thy precious balm more healing for his woes
>?
Than any consolation mortal knows,
Thy calming influence once shed over grief,
' * y * ? ,
Brings to the stricken soul a sweet relief.

Unconscious, long past morning?s dawn she slept,
And saw in dreams the loved ones whom she wept;
Heaven grant her strength, for when she doth awaken
She?ll find herself alone, ?though not forsaken.
A second time the party sad returns;
A second time the weeping mother learns
Of the sad, fruitless search thro? night and day;
Then the last hope she cherished dies away.
(
? Ere this they must be dead, my darlings, dead;
The long damp grass, that formed their only bed,
Now rustles o?er them like a funeral plume,
As they lie stiffening in the forest gloom.
Oh! My sweet lost ones Their blue eyes so bright,
Now closed for ever in eternal night.
The sunny locks that o?er their shoulders flow,
Trampled and torn by many a forest crow,
While the fierce buzzard?s hard and horny beak
Pecks at the velvet skin of their soft cheek.
Oh ! Could we but have laid them in the tomb,
And wept beside them o?er their early doom;
I
*
I I


Kissed their sweet faces, heard their parting breath,
And gazed upon their infant forms in death !
But e?en that sad sweet pleasure is denied;
i
Wonld that I too might die! ? she mourning sighed.
In vain the hapless father tries to find
Some comfort for her sorrowing, troubled mind;
All is in vain, quite deaf to consolation,
The echo rings with her wild lamentation.
Thus passed eight days; eight long sad days of grief:
Eight nights of searching, which brought no relief;
But, as they each passed by on wings of lead,
The fear grew stronger that the three were dead.
And grief?s sharp arrow, with its bitter smart,
Entered still deeper that poor mother?s heart.
Until the ninth sad morn they vainly sought,
When to the father came this sudden thought:?
?We all have failed, not one can find the track;
What if we try the instinct of the black ?
The pathless wild to them is as a book;
They know each giant tree, each tiny brook;


With ease they read their way through bush and plain,
p f
By tangled paths, ?where we have searched in vain.
Yet one chance more, we?ll try it! ? All agreed;
/ �
Quick they set out, a native took the lead.
Ere long they reached the spot, then found a trace;
Hope shines again in each sad anxious face.
? Perchance, e?en now, their bodies we may save,
And bury them together in one grave.?
All eager follow, till one clever guide
Turns from the track a little to one side.
? Here little one, quite tired, him tumble down;
Big brother help him up, then wander on,
Till both together by this bush they fall,
/
Cannot get up, nobody hear them call.?
Thus seeking on, with hurrying feet they pass
Thro? the entangled mass of forest grass,
Arousing many a wily poisonous snake,
Which hisses at them from the thorny brake,
Then glides away, and soon is lost to sight,
Like some weird phantom of a troubled night.
The foremost guide, now hastening on apace,
Discovers soon a clear and open space;
7< K


Quite in the centre stands a clump of trees,
Whose leafy branches quiver in the breeze.
A deaf?ning yell, a shout! ?Neath one huge tree
Are stretched the forms of all the long-lost three.
Not dead! But, oh, so near it, there they lie,
Their pallid faces upturned to the sky.
The youngest in the midst, wrapt snugly there,
As with a mother?s, tender thought and care,
Still calmly sleeping, safe from every harm,
Covered with Janie?s frock to keep him warm.
With self-denying love, this tiny child
Had stripped it from her in the forest wild.
The father rushes forward, ?great his joy,
And seizes in his arms the youngest boy;
The mother sinks to earth; her thankful prayer
\
Is heard in heaven; angels record it there.
Soon are the babes caught up, and warmed, and fed
By loving, tender hands with wine and bread;
Until, with heartfelt joy, they see at length
The growing signals of returning strength.
Then all haste homewards with the precious three;
The blacks who found them dance and yell with glee

The hist?ry spreads like lightning thro? the vale;
Each to another tells the thrilling tale.
\
Wond?ring, all listen, mute with strange surprise;
Then tears of feeling dim e?en strangers eyes.
The log-hut?s threshold was by many crossed;
All wished to see the children who were lost.
All spoke of Janie Duff till she became
A heroine: ?and she deserves the name.

Wherever thro? the land this story goes,
Mothers will weep o?er these poor children?s woes;
And infant lips will oft the story crave
Of the young wanderers rescued from the grave.

Another quickly fleeting year
Had nearly passed away,
And welcome Christmas, drawing near,
Brought wreaths of holly gay,
And iyy green, to mix between
With mistletoe, was often seen.
The crystal snow lay thick and white
Upon the wintry earth;
It only made a lovely sight,
And heightened Christmas mirth;
Around each hearth a festive throng,
Assembled for the dance and song.


From every house, from every room,
The warm and cheerful ray
Shone out into the deepening gloom,
And turned night into day.
Within were lords and ladies fair;
Sweet music floated on the air.
And up and down the merry street
The coaches rolled all night;
The tread of many thousand feet
Was heard till morning bright.
Then all dispersed and went their way.
Surprised too soon by break of day.

Little thought any in that crowd
Of pleasure-seekers, rich and proud,
That there were homeless poor,
Who had no shelter for their head;
And must e?en beg their daily bread
From the gay, rich man?s door.
In a dark alley, hid from sight,
So narrow that the sun?s warm light
But rarely pierced the gloom;
There dwelt a wretched family,
Sunk low in deepest poverty,
They had but one small room.


"K
�
The roof was bad, the falling snow
Dripped thro? npon the floor below,
It was a bitter day;
Two broken chairs, a table small,
i
With one poor bed, made up their all,
On which the father lay.
His face was thin, his cheeks were pale,
A hacking cough told its own tale;
The bright though sunken eye,
Which seemed in vain to seek for rest ;
The thin hand on his forehead pressed,
All said that he must die.
Hush! Listen now! He tries to speak;
His voice is trembling, and so weak
As scarce to sound at all;
Yet from the comer of the room
A woman, till now hid in gloom,
Hastes forward at his call.
THE IDIOT.


? Nay, Jessie dear, yon must not weep;
Come, wipe those tears that sadly creep,
It grieves me when you cry;
I?ve many things to say to yon;
I feel my hours are very few,
And I shall shortly die.
a
f
? So listen to me, Jessie dear,
And bring my darling children near,
And place them in the light;
Perchance when I am gone away,
Sometimes they?ll think upon this day,
And not forget me quite.
? I?ve loved you, Jessie, all my life;
You?ve ever been a tender wife;
Alas! We now must paid;!
?Tis long since I have worked for you,
And earned bread as I used to do;
And that has grieved my heart.


Of the bright angel?s land.

? Yet, Jessie dear, we must be still,
It is our Heavenly Father?s will,
So we should not complain;
I?ll tell you what I saw last night;
It was a vision clear and bright,
That I would see again.
? There was a lovely angel pure,
Standing upon a distant shore
And beckoning me to go;
But a black river ran between,
Through wdiich no shallow ford was seen,
i
And I knelt still in woe!
? When, on a sudden, from the flood
There rose a bridge of shining wood,
Held by a nail-pierced hand
Quickly, in joy, I passed o?er,
And reached the calm and distant shore

j
? So now I feel that Christ is near;
That thought has banished all my fear
Of dying and the grave;
I know my sins are very great,
And tho? I turned to Cod so late ;
Yet Jesu died to save.
?Now, Jessie, darling will you run
And call my helpless idiot son,
I?d see him ere I die;
To tell him of the land above,
Where I shall meet with those I love;
/
A home beyond the sky.?
So Davie came, with happy face;
Poor idiot boy! and showed no trace
Of mourning or of woe;
He sat down by his father?s bed,
With both rough hands he stroked his head,
And muttered soft and low:
THE IDIOT.


I
Before the eastern clouds were red,
i
The sufP?ring father?s spirit fled
i
To realms beyond the sky.
The idiot boy seemed not to know I *
That he was dead, but murmured low,
? He sleeps, he did not die.?

?Why does my own sweet mother cry?

The rich folks welcomed Christmas time,
With many a glad ? good morrow,?
But to that alley dark and cold
It brought no balm for sorrow.
> .
The frost lay thick upon the ground,
The glist?ning roofs so white,
Beneath the rays of Christmas sun,
Seemed decked with diamonds bright.
But to those children fatherless,
Blithe Christmas brought no joy;
Not even to the trusting heart
Of that poor idiot boy.


iX

The widow now, for many days,
Had wandered np and down,
Seeking for work in many streets
Of London?s busy town.
But none, alas! would think of her,
She looked so very weak;
And as she turned away, the tears
Rolled down her sunken cheek.
She thought of her six children dear;
Of all they must endure,
From cruel hunger, piercing cold,
They were so very poor.
She?d seen them growing day by day
More thin, and weak, and pale;
The little sum her husband left
Had long begun to fail.
THE IDIOT.


At length there came a mournful day;
The children cried for bread;
? Alas! I?ve none to give you, dears,?
Their weeping mother said.
Then little Janie soon fell ill,
She never had been strong;
And Jessie felt, if no help came,
That she would die ere long.
Through many a sorrowing night and day
She waited, watched, and prayed
The Father of the Fatherless
To send some timely aid.
Until one morning, as she sat,
O?ercome with sad despair,
By little Janie?s bed, she heard
A footstep on the stair.

Sweet as an angel?s tone;
And, listening gratefully, she felt
No longer left alone.
And then a hand upon the latch,
The room door opened wide.
And slowly looking up she saw
A lady by her side.
The lonely widow wondered much
Wherefore the lady came,
Until she heard a gentle voice
Address her by her name.
Oh! sweet to her were kindly words,
The heavy burden, she had thought
Was more than she could bear,
Felt lighter, now another came
Her weight of woe to share.

For sympathy is sweet to those
Who are with care oppressed;
And soothing words may heal the wound*
Of many hearts distressed.
The lady listened to the tale
Of poverty and grief:
She pitied the poor widow sad,
And offered kind relief.
J ?
? If I can find your boy a home
Your helpless idiot child;
Would you object to part with him??
She asked in accents mild.
? T?will not be very far away;
You may perchance have heard
The name of ? Eaelswood Idiot?s Home,?
For ?tis a household word.?

So ?twas agreed he should be sent;
And when they?d fixed the day,
The lady sent him many things
Before he went away;
And brought some wine and strengthening soup
For suffering little Jane,

The roses bloomed again.
