FEW Paris Papers of dif-
ferent titles from thofe rc-
ceived on Tuefday night,
but of the fame date, came
A to hand yefterday. They,
however, furnifli little news
deferving of notice. It ap-
Mife wW 1 Sif pears the Diet at Prefburgh
has clofed its fittings-, after haying granted the
demands of his Imperial Majcfty, and, after
having in return obtained an unlimited privi-
lege for Hungary to export its productions of
every kind.
A private letter from Paris Hatesas follows
� Every endeavour has been made to fupprefs
the idea of a violent tumult having taken place
at Cette (formerly Provence), and reports of a
very contradictory nature have been fabricated to
render the afeertaining the truth more difficult.
The party who are againft the Firft Confu!
being elected for life, feem to maintain their
ground, and will not recede from their affer-
tions; they fpeak freely upon the fubjeCt, and
fay that the difturbance has been occalioned by
the compulfivc and arbitrary meafures adopted
to enfure the votes of the inhabitants for a raea-
fure which they will not fupport. This party is dif-
tinguifhedby the appellation of Les Anti-Confu-
laires. Their opponents urge, with equal vio-
lence; that a mere quarrel amongft the foldiery
and the country people, upon the market-place,
has been conftrued into a rebellion, and that
nothing of the kind ever had a lefs ferious caufe,
or a lefs ferious afpeCt than the diHurbance at
Cette. It appears, however, pretty certain,
from the wounds which have been given and re-
ceived, the filence of the public papers, and the
care taken to fupprefs all paragraphs refpeCUng
the bufinefs, that fomething more than a com-
mon quarrel actually took place.?
Bonaparte is refolved U render the Seine na-
vigable for veffels of 150 tons burden. The
plan was prefentedto bin. by the late Minifter
Forfait. The EirH Conful has a lhare in the
undertaking, for which about 12,c001. fterling
have been already fubferibed.
M. de Calonne has been received with un-
ufual refpeCl by the French Government, aiyri
i- iraoft daily with M. de Tdleyrarru. It is
likely to recover alraoft all his funded
gj. ~y in France.
,t is faid that the famous Santerre, who com-
manded.the-National Guard at the execution
of Louis XVI. has obtained a penfion from the
French Government, to relieve him from ex-
treme'poverty.
General Andreoffi, lately appointed to the
Britifli Embaffy, (fays the Bulletin Particulier
de Paris) is one among the few who unite in a
high degree, the talents that fhould alw'S'-?S dft-
finguilh the Politician, the Magiftrate, ;id the
Soldier. -He has been alraoft the infe -arable
Companion and Affiftant of the Firft C
wbofe efteem and confidence he has always po
feffed. His genius is acute, his judgment coi-
reCl, his mind and difpnfition conciliatory, and
though his name has not frequently been blend-
ed with political operations, he has always been
ranked among the moft worthy members of So-
ciety ; and the choice made of him, to repre-
sent the Republic at a great Court, is the moft
unequivocal pledge of a folid and permanent
Peace, fcrlndcd. in the glory and profperity of
the two great nations.
By letters from Vienna, of the 4?h of June,
it appears that their Imperial MajeHiea are .ex-
pected the next day in that capital from Hun-
gary. They are to fet out the enfuing week for
their fummer refidence at Luxemburg: the
Queen of Naples, the Grand Duke of T ufcany,
and the young Archdukes, will go to Schoen-
brunn. Her Majefty, from the delicate Hate of
her health, and by the advice of her phyficians,
is prevented from fetting out on her return to
Italy before the 18th of July. ?
It is expefted that, towards the beginning of
July, his Pruffian Majefty will detach fome
troops for the purpOfe of taking poffeflion of
the Biftioprics ofTMdefheim and Paderborn, of
a great part of Weftphalia, Efchfield, and Er-
furt, on his own account; and of the Bilhopric
of Fulda for the benefit of the illuftrious Houfe
of Orange. t The Firft Conful, it is faid, has
acquiefced m the wiihes of the King of Pruffia
in what regards this double tranfaCtioni
It is reported that in the diftribution of the
Indemnities which .are about to be fettled in
Germany, the Bilhopric of Ofnaburgh is to
be annexed to the Electorate of Hanover in per-
petuity.
By accounts from the Continent, we are
happy to fee trade reviving there, and (till more
happy to know that it is reviving in the City of
London, where the general profpeClsbrigbtenup.
Lord Hutchinfon, it is faid, when he receives
his Majefty?s permiffion to wear the Order of
the Crefcent, is to apply for the Officers who
received medals from the Sultan Selim for their
fervices in Egypt, under his command, for leave
to wear them alfo.
The 4id Regiment, who immortaiifed them-
fclves in Egypt by their conqneft And extirpa-
tion of Bonaparte?s Invincibies, have, in their
going to their native country, been received at
every town with uncommon joy and public
gratitude. At Penrith, Kendal, and feveral
other place on the Northern Road, the Corpo-
rations and Volunteers went feveral miles to
give them a hearty welcome ; and as they ap-
proached the towns, the L..dies, by the waving
of their handkerchiefs and loud acclamations,
proved the cordiality of their congratulations
to thofe who fo glorioufly vindicated our na-
tional character and honour. It is to be hoped
that thefe brave men will be received with at
lead equal diftimftion in their own country.
According to recent letters from the Cape,
Sir Roger Curtis was much indifpofed there.
The (hips of war that were on that Ration are
all ordered to Ceylon to carry the troops that
have been in garrifon at the Cape. They
amount to 5000 men.
The reductions in the army ordered, in the
firft. inftance, to take place, were yefterday
completely effected throughout the Empire.
Yefterday a Common Hall of the Livery was
held, for the election of Sheriffs and other City
Officers for the year enfuing ; when Richard
Welch and James Alexander, Efqrs. were elect-
ed Sheriffs ; Richard Clark, Efq. the Chamber-
lain, and the other City Officers, were unani-
moufty re-eleCted ; but the vacant office of Ju-
nior Bridge Mafter was, conceded by Meffrs.
Marriott, Yeoward, Bu'.tcock, Brown, and
Clark. The fhew of hands was declared to be
in favour of Mr. Marriott; but Mr. Yeoward?s
friends, in confequence of the great fupport he
received, demanded a poll.
[Price Sixpence.]
The next Parliament, it is fdppoftd, 1 willcon- .
tain a greater portion of the mercantile infereft
than any former one.
Mr. John Denifon, candidate for Cplchefter,
has met with a molt flattering reception on his
arrival there, having been met previous to bis
reaching the town by a large body of the moll
refpeClable inhabitants and freemen ?his horfes
taken from his carriage, and drawn into the
to wn by the populace, preceded by a band .of
imific.
Col. Stewart is gone off to Scotland, to (land
for Wigtownshire, on the hereditary, influence
of his father, the Earl of .Galloway, in oppofi-
tion to Mr. Heron, who Hands on the intereft of
Mr. Dundas.
Admiral Gardner hasannounced his intention
of again (landing for Weftminfter, and his Lord,
ftiip, with Mr. Fox, will, it is fuppofed, be re-
turned without oppofltion.
Mr. William Bell, who lately appeared a? a
Candidate for the town of Hull, has declined
the conteft. The Addrefs to that effeCl is both
candid and honourable. After Hating that he
confidtred his caufe as that of freedom, he con-
cludes :/

? I trull that in thefe proceedings, ! have
done nothing to forfeit the eHeem of my fellow-
townfmen, which if continued to me in my
profeffrou of an Auctioneer, will enfure my
refidence among them, and leave me on that ac-
count lefs reafon for regret,

? W. Bell will, in a (hort time, offer for
Sale by AuLlion, feveral of the beH Treatifea

he will have po further occafion for them.?
After the meeting of the new Parliament there
will be a fine cr o? bnfinefs for the Gentlemen
of the long robe, on Eledion Committees, .as
many of the old intereHs in the Boroughs are at-
tacked, and eledfions will be made on prin-
ciples contrary to thofe latply refpedted. The
old Borough intereH generally will be much
(haken.
It is the opinion of fome very experienced
fpeculatiHs, that, after the approaching election,
there will be a diminution of fifty per cent, in
the greater part of what is called Borough pro-
perty, throughout the kingdom.

Extr-aft of a Letter from Shrenujbury, June 18.
? On the Annivcrfary of his Majefty?s Birth-
day, the Wenlock Loyal Volunteers,command-
cd by Major Forefter, marched to Willey, the
feat of their worthy Commandant, where?, after
performing various evolutions, and firing feve-
ral excellent vollies, they depofited their co-
lours. The corps were entertained at Willey
with a bountiful cold collation, cbmpofed of
and given in the fame ftile of true old Englilh
hofpitality.
On their return to Wenlock, they fired
three vollies in honour of the day, after which,
Major Forefter communicated to them the
Thanks of his Majefty, and both Houfes of
Parliament, and in a very impreffive fpeech
took an affedlionate leave of the Corps, inform-
ing them they were difeharged from further
ftrviccs.
? Before the arms were lodged, Capt. Collins,
in the name of himfelf, the Officers, and Pri-
vates, returned the Major their fincere thanks
for his unremitting attention and liberality,'and
allured him, that ihould a future occafton re-
quire their fervices, every man would obey
when he commanded.
? This very refpedlable Corps w-as eftablilli-
ed, disciplined and fupported, without any aid
fiom Govermjient, and we know that Major
Forefter, highly to his credit, fpared neither
perfonal trouble, nor pecuniary affiftance, in
promoting every thing which tended to its per-
fedtion.
? To diffipate the melancholy which evidently-
pervaded the whole at parting, the corps were
invited by their Major to partake of a moft libe-
ral entertainment, and this day concluded tiieir
fervices in a manner equally refpedlable to Offi-
cers and Privates.?
Extract of a Letter from Brighton, June 13.
? Wit. Foord, Efq. who (as I dated in my
laft), after cutting his throat with a razor, was
taken out of the Anna, from Bengal, and
brought into this place on Monday, expired yef-
terday afternoon. His children, four in num-
ber, the elded not more than eleven years old,
arrived about fix hours after his diflblution. The
Coroner?s In quell was this day held on the body.
Verdidl?Lunacy.
? One troop of the 18th regiment of ca-
valry marched from this town on Monday, for
Eaftbourne. A detachment of the tenth, to
fupply their place, is therefore daily expedled.?
DEARNESS OF PROVISIONS.
The following obfervations on this fubiefl,
which appear to have been the refuit of candid
hftcu aUon ? are hora a pamphiet !ate, y P ub -
*? Ihe dearnefs ofprovifions is acircumftance
which, at prefent very naturally fore s itfelf
upon our attention. The remedy is, oerhans
not fo eafy to difeover as the caufe; yet prefu-
otce has oeen allowed rather too much weight
in fome difeuffions on this fsibjedf. That the
ftocs pn hand has been perceptibly dihiinifliing
fince the year i 795 is admitted ; 'but is it not
equally true, that we confume a greater q�an-
q y i of J? od than vve dui twenty vears ago?
Surely this may be inferred from oitr increafe
of population. But this is not all. It is not
that ten men confume move than five men d'd
twenty years ago; but that ten men now co�?
lume more than ten men at that period. It has
often been obfaved by foreigners who have
vifiled our ifland, that the Englifn 0 f all c lafl>s
conlume one-third more of every article of lifo
than the people of any other country in the
world; and tn articles of luxury they reckon
as they well may, double. We all knqw that
cheapnefs and dearnefs are relative terms ; but
they will not be io well underftood by com-
paring country with country, or period with
period, as by comparing the modes of livinj?
Now that thefe are changed of date years in
this country, every fhopkeeper, trader, and
merchant can atteft, who has lived long enough
to remember when the plain joint and the pud-
ding gave place to the well-fpread table of creat
variety, the fplendid deffort, and well ftocked
cellar, and this among perfons of the fame rank
in life. Mr. Hume fays, that in attempting to
juege of the population and its effe(fts, in an-
cient and modern times, it is neceflary to com-
pare the domefticand political fituations of the
two periods. And may we not add, this is
equally neCelfary is conlidering the quantity of
provudons confumed ? v 1
This love of comforts, always natural to
our people, and rendered more ealiiy indulged
by the means which indufiricus and enterprffimr
individuals pofiefs to enlarge their fortunes,
leads on to a progrefiiou in luxury, perhaps in
vvafte, which ought to incline us, when we con.
fider the high price of proviiions, to turn our
attention alfo to the low value of money This
remark may be thought trite, as it really is;
but it is, neverthelefs, frequently forgotten
and, therefore, it may net be improper to il-
iu(lrate it by figures. According to Sir George
Shuckburgh Evelyn?s table of the depreciation
ot money (1 ran fa id ions of the R. S.), it was
from 169610 1800 in the ratio of above a 14 .- 3
to 562, ib thatni. in 1696 was equal in power
to 2!. 7 s. ud. in 1800. ?Thus the average
price ot wheat in the year 1696 was equal to
6i. 143. 2d. in the very dear year of 1800.?
? Thofe who have dated that increafed po-
pulation (joined to other caufes) had an influ-
ence on the high price of articles in general,
have been aceufed of advancing what is abfiird-
for how, it is laid, can any country increafe fo
rapidly as to be furpnfed into an event of this
kind i Not eafily, perhaps;, but the queftion is
too abrupt, and does not -arife haturady from
the premifes. 1 hat our population has in-
creafed very greatly,, and much .beyond- any
ideas entertained by mere peculators, is now
clearly afeertained ; and it is nd lefs a faCj, that
there is a great and vifible increafe of wealth
and induftry ; notwithftanding which, we clear-
ly trace back a decreafe in the general (lock of
gram m the kingdom, fince the year 1 795, which
cannot be attributed to the .war, as it-had not
then cxifted two years. To what, then, may it 1�
aferibed, as neared to probabilkevbut tcvfhe'in-
creafe of population, the lefTccts of which
had been operating in a progreffive, though im-
perceptible degree, for many years before.
.Idd to this, we have fince experienced two
fucceffive years of fmall crops, and that, too


in the midft of war; this is no common event,
and would have been f?everely felt by any coun-
try in tirtics of peace. Our trade and our
wealth infured us a fupply ; but thofe very
caufes, likevvife, contributed to enhance the
price bath at home and abroad in a greater pro-
portion than the fame 'Wants 'would have done in
any other country than oiir, own. There would
be no difficulty to prove this pofition by indif-
putable facts. We know by experience it.has
been proved by figures, clfe we ihould have
thought it impoffible, for the nation to fupport :
an increafe of debt of nearly 350,000,000!. dur-
ing the vfar j nor. Ihould we believe that, dur-
ing the fame period, the value of our exports
had more than doubled, and the tonnage of our
.merchants fliips nearly treijled. Yet, when all
this is acknowledged, feme people fly from the
?natural cpnfcqnences of wealth, to inquire
after new reafons for the high price of provi-
lions, while the increafe of luxurious confiimp-
tion Hands cOnfcited, and is confirmed by this
circum fiance, an? ong many others, that we now
produce infinitely more food in a bad feafon
than we uid .formerly in what was reckoned a
good one. We Aval! only add (with deference
to any meafares that may hereafter be recom-
mended) our opinion, that any fyftem which
forces cottagers from their hamlets into villages
and towns, will be ultimately found injurious
to the State.?
The paragraphs that have appearedin the pa-
pers reflecting certain bequdls in the late Mr.
Jollifife?s- will, are.incorredf. The will has juft
been proved, and there is nothing unufual in it.

laft codicil was made af er his accident ?he was
only able to fign it with , his mark, which was
for the purpofe of adding 50001.t0 a former le-
gacy of the fame amount to his youngeft fon.

'?OFE Houfe met,'puffoaht to ?adjournment,
fliortly after one o?clock when their Lord-
Rips pfoclh ded to the frimfaftidn of'.private
jbutiuefs. The forthep corifiderati.on of the .ap-
peal Harlowc and others v. the Governors of

affirm certain interlocutors, to. reverfe-others,,

for the farther con ft delation of the Qourt. of
Sefliou.
On the appeal, Hf>g-o,Th wakes, their Lord-
Rips came to;.a dccilion, tending, to reverfe the
decree.
On the important caufe, the Flefliers* Com-
pany off Edinburgh v. the Lord Proved and
?Corporation of the fame, the, Lord-. Chancellor
delivered his fentitnents of its merits at cohfi-
derable. length. He concluded by moving a
proposition/ as the judgment of their Lord-
Ibips, life refult of which was, that the caufe,
be remitted back to the. farther eonfideraiion of
the Court of Scflloii, with directions, &c.
Lord' 7%urlonb r fhortly delivered his opinion
of the cafe, and he exprjeffed his hope, as the
caufe would certainly come , here again, that
the Court of Sefiion would condefcend to ftate
' fpecifically what demands are to be made, and
againft what perfons, and their reafons.in point
'of law Upon which filch demands are grounded.
The queftion was then put, on the Lord
Chancellor? 3 propolition, which was agreed to
by the Houfe.
The confideration of the remaining caufes
which (food for this day, among which is the
important.cafe of judgment, Morthland v. Ca-
dell, were, on the motion of the Lord Chancel-
lor, poflponed till to-morrow.

HOUSE OF COMMONS.
Thursday, June. 24.
, The.Report of the Committee refpefting the
providing additional Rooms and Offices for
Committees, was taken into confideration, on
which'
Mr. Banker moved, that an humble Addrefs
be prefented to his Majefty, laying before his
Majefty the Report, with the Plans thereto an-
nexed, and praying that his Majefty would be
gracipufly plea fed to give directions for carry-
ing into effeft the. Alterations and Improve-
ments therein deferibed, and that the Houfe
would make good the fame.?Ordered.
NITRIC FUMIGATION.
Mr. Wilberforce faid, he rofe for the purpofe
of difeha'ging a debt of juftice, in moving an
Addrefs to his Majefty on the Petition of D..
Carmichatl Smyth. It would be remembered,
? hat many weeks lioce a Petition bad been pre-
footed by Dr. Carmichael Smyth, rt-fpefting.
Nitric Fumigation, for preventing the Commu-
nication of Contagion, That Petition Was re-
ferred to a Committee, who, after a long and
laborious inyeftigation of the. fabjeCt, had pre-
fented a Report which had been fome time on
the Table, and which, together with the.Ap-.
pendix, would, he had no doubt, have the ef-
fcft of convincing the greater part of that
Houfe of the juftice of Dr. Smyth?s claim to a
rcrpMnevat'on for his exertions. The efficacy of
the invention had been fully eftablifhed: of its
importance th; e could be no doubt, whilft Dr.
Smyth had a juft claim to originality in the in-
vention, which was the refult of much laborious
ftady. Dr. Smyth had given it to the Public, of
whom he wits juftly entitled to claim a remune-
tion, fines it was a difeovery for the benefit of
the Public, and fife Inventor could have no
hope of remuneration from individuals. The
Appendix to the Report fufficiently pointed
' but the, benefits which-, had. resulted from this
difeovery, in preventing the communication of
contagidn ; .and not only that, but it leffened
the ill effe.ft.s of contagious difeafcs in the indi-
viduals aftlifted by thofc difeafes. He had un-
derftobd that- it was neceffary to inftrt a fpeci-
fic fum in the Addrefs, in doing which he ex-
perienced fome difficulty. If he had inferted a
fum proportioned to the merits of the indivi-
dual. it would have appeared much too large:
he thought, however, that a moderate fum
might be mentioned,. which, whilft it ferved as
fome remuneration to Dr. Smyth, it would, at
the fame time, more, effectually operate to (lamp
the difeovery with the impreffinn of public uti-
lity, and would be confide-red as a teftimony of
the approbation-of that Houfe as to the merits
of the invention. He had, therefore, inferted
the fum of 50001. which he thought was fo mo-
derate, that there could be no objection to it.
He concluded by moving, ? That an humble
Addrefs fhould be prefented to his Majefty,
praying that he would be gracioully pleafed to
give directions that a fum not exceeding 50001.
fhould be advanced to Dr. James Carmichael
Smyth, and that the Houfe would make good
the fame.?
Mr. ErJldne feconded the motion. He could
hardly conceive/ he faid, a greater body of evi-
dence to eftabliih any. fad than that by which
the benefit re faking from the difeovery of Dr.
Smyth had been proved.
Mr. Ddiiid Scott obferved that the Nitric Fu-
migation had bepn, tried in the Eaft India Ser-
vice, and had admirably fucceeded in prevent-
ing the communication of Contagion. There
was even feme reafon to believe that it might be
effectually ufed in preventing the communica-
tion of the Plague.
Lord Clenbervis, Mr. Courtenay, General
Loftus, and Sir Andre-w Snape diamond, all
fpoke in favour of the diicovery.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer faid, he
thought it his duty to examine, with the utmoft
caution, the applications made to that Houfe for
public money. The body of evidence, however,
which was contained in the Report on the Peti-
tion of Dr. Smyth, .wasfully fufficient to induce
him to confent to the prefent Motion, as he
thought nothing was ever more indifputably
made out than the efficacy and importance of
this difcovety.and alfo the exclufiveclaim ofDr.
Carmichael Smyth to the merit of the difeovery.
He was convinced that in confenting to the pre-
fent Motion, which would ftamp the difeovery
with public approbation, he was doing juftice
to the individual, and performing an act of real
benevolence, not only to this Country, but to
the whole Univerfe.
Colonel IVood hoped the Right Hoh. Gentle-
man "(che Chancellor of the Exchequer) would
have no objection to allowing Dr. Smyth his ex-
pences.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer faid, it would
be invidious to nuke any diftinftion between
this cafe and others which had. preceded it, but
June 24?2$
it would be for the wifdotr, of the Houfe to cor"
?fider of any method of exonerating the indivi-
duals to whom the remunerations were given,
from the expences attendant" upon fueh Votes
which confided of fees fairly and juftly due to
fevcral Officers, under the fanftion of Parlia-
ment.
The motion was then ? put and carried new,
con.
Mr. N. Vanfittart prefented an account of
the Bounties paid on Corn and Rice imported
?which was ordered to lie on the Table.
A meffage from the Lords informed the Houfe
that their Lordfaips had agreed t-- Lord II lit-
chinfon?s Annuity Bill, the Land Tax�edemp-
tion Bill, the Hydrometer Bill, be Hie of Man
Bill, the Miiford Bill, and the Deer Steal-
ing Bill, without any Amendment; and to the
Alien-Bill with fcveral Amendments, to which
they dtflred the concurrence of this Houfe.
Friday, June 15.
The Houfe having agreed to the Lords?
amendments to the Alien Bill, fent a Meffage
to acquaint their Lordfhips therewith.
A Meffage from the Lords informed the Houfe
that the Lords had agreed to the Five Milions
Exchequer Bills Bill, and feven or eight more.
FINANCE.
The Order of the Day being then read for
the refumption of the adjourned debate upon
the Financial�efplutionsfubmitted to the Houfe
by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr.
Tierney,
Mr. ?Tierney faid, he was merely defirous that
his UcfoUitions Ihould be placed upon the Jour-
nals, and that he was very indifferent whether
this was done by their being negatived, or the
previous queftion being put upon them. He
ftiould not take up the time of the Houfe with
any remarks, as the difference between him
and the Right Hon. Gentleman was inconfider-
able, and his chief objeft was to have his opi-
nions recorded. He concluded by moving the
firft Refolution,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer faid., he
fhould trouble the Houfe with a very few' obfer-
vations upon the Refolutions moved by the
Hon. Gentleman. In eftimating the amount of
the National Debt, he thought the Hon. Gentle-
man was not juftified in charging the valuation
of the Long Annuities. He might as well have
valued the Short Annuitiesbut neither of them
could be juftly confidcred as adding to the mafs
of the debt. They were a charge, not an incum-
brance; The amount, by ( dedufting this ar-
ticle, would-fee reduced two millions. In the
6th refolution the Hon. Gentleman had efti-
mated the fum applicable to the reduction of
the national debt-too low. He ought to have
included the dividends received 1 dllfing the laft
quarter by the Commiffioners, and the whole
would then have amounted to yjSqOjOool. In
computing the produce of,the permanent taxes,
he ought certainly to have made an allowance
for the fum ,paid away in com bounties, and
for the lofs fullamed by the ttoppage of the
diftilleries. When that addition was made, the
produce of the, permanent taxes for the laft year
would-be found U> amount to 33,684,514!. be-
ing more than- in 1799 ?the? moft flourilhing
year our revenues had ever known. He was
fatisfied that {he Country had ample means to
bear all its burthens, and that we might confi-
dently look forward to a long periodof national
profperity. As the Hon. Gentleman?s Rdolu-
tions differed fo immaterially from his own, he
did not feel it confident with his duty to nega-
tive them. He therefore begged leave to move
the previous queftion.
; Mr. Tierney obferved, that he had not valued
the Short Annuities, only be.caufr he knew no
way of valuing them. He furely was juftified in
including the I,ong Annuities,'ns the' Legilla-
tpre, in.the Sinking Fund Aft, had confidercd
them as 3. part of the National Debt. In the
way in which, the Right Hon. Gentleman, had
TrH.E LOND O N CHRONICLE fot 1302.


framed his refolution about the Sinking Fund,
he was quite cbrredl in dating it at 5,800,000k
but be himfelf had, as on former years, efti-
Hfated it at what it was on the 2d of February
preceding.
Mr. Eanfittdrt went over the fame ground
with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer then rofe to
{fate the fubftatice of his refolutions. Though
the Hon. Gentleman and himfelf, he faid,' agreed
in form, yet, with regard to the financial fltua-
tion of the Country, in fafl, they widely differ-
ed, He did not complain of what the Hon.
Gentleman had inerted in his refolutions, but
what he had omitted. ?He had attempted to
fupply the deficiency, that he might efface any
falfe impreffion that might have been made on
the public mind. He then read a paper, which
?at grerft length, and with very great minutenefs,
detailed the amount of taxes, the number of
Blips, the value of exports- and imports, &c.
The whole of this information has been repeat-
edly, laid before the Houfe and the public, and
may be found in the Right Hon. Gentleman?s
refolutions inferted in our Chronicle of
TiUufday laft. He then congratulated the
Houfe upon the happy fituation in which the
? Country flood:?we were amply able to fatisfy
every demand that could be made upon us, and
even without much bardlhip to bear new bur-
thens, if it ihould be neceffhry to make frefh
exertions in defence of our independence and,
our honour; but he thanked God that he antici-
pated no fuch neceffity. When the Country
had llouriflied fo much during War, what might
not be expedted from Peace. In 1786 the
Sinking Fund was to the National Debt, as
1. to 238, now it was as Ito 84. When
during war we had been difeharging our incum-
brances, how fafl would they be difeharged
during Peace. He trufted that in a future year
he would bear the Hon. Gentleman recant his
opinions, and allow that he had under-rated the
refources of the Country.
Mr .Tierney rofe to vindicate himfelf from the
charge of having milled the Public. His only
objefl was, to give a juft and compiehenfive
view of our financial filiation. It was rather
curious that the Right Hon. Gentleman was met
with the very arms he had ufed, and that the
propofed antidote was compofed of the fame
ingredients with the poifon? which had com-
municated the difeafe. With 12 out of the 13
refolutions moved by him, the Right Hon. Gen-
tleman?s counter-relblutions almoft completely
agreed. It was his misfortune to differ from the
Right Hon. Gentleman with fegard to the date
of the revenue, but upon this, as upon all fimi-
Jar occafions, he bad been anxious to guard
againft infufmg defpondence into the public
mind. He faw no ground for defpondence,
but only, a neceffity for a ftridt attention to our
finances, by which, and by hvhich alone, we
might overcome our difficulties, though they
were undoubtedly formidable. It Ihould be re-
colledtcd that there was a great difference be-
tween this Peace and the laft, as the laft fuc-
ceeded a moft difaftrous War, and during the
late War our trade had flourished to an unex-
ampled degree. If the amount of our taxes
had been, railed by the War, there was furely
nothing, very extravagant in fuppoflng that it
might be diminilhed by Peace.
The Chancellor of the. Exchequer difclaimed
Ml intention of imputing improper motives to
the Hon. Gentleman. He believed that he felt
�o ?inclination to excite defpondence, but that
he was folely adtuated by a fenfe of public duty.
He then relumed the topics on which he had
foroierly dwelt. He maintained that repayment
'of the Imperial Loan might foon be expedted;
that we might, by and by hope to (hare in the
territorial revenues of India, and that the in-
tereft of. the - four and five per Cents, might be
fpeedily reduced. He thought it was impcffible
to look forward with appreheftlion. However,
be only talked of what was probable, aind
Ihould reckon it no reproach if he found if
neceffary to refort to extraordinary meafure?
to provide' for - the national expenditure. He
was happy to think that there was no great
arrear to be paid off, as at former periods like
the prefent. No Minifter had ever provided for
the expences of a war like his predecelfor.
Betides, means had already been taken to wind
up the public accounts, and never had fo much
been before done during the firft year of peace.
Mr. Fanfttart faid he thought he could eafily
prove that our commerce had nothing to fear
from the return of peace. The war had not
favoured it; it had ftouHlhcd in fpite of the
war. Except to the captured illands, we en-
joyed no branch of trade from the war, and
that was not to be compared to thole of which
it deprived us. Our taxes muft incrcafe, be-
came our confumption increafed. Taking the
average of the three years before the war, and
the laft three years, 700 ton of wine was ufed
yearly during the latter period more than dur-
ing the former, upwards of 400 millions of
pounds of tea, and 933 cwt. of fugar. The
capital lately employed in loans and contracts
would now be turned to productive induflry.
During the eight years before the war, 750 Acts
palled for local improvement, and during the
laft eight years, 1172. Peace wouk! give anew
impetus to thefe exertions, and during the pre-
fent feffion more private bufinefs had aClually
been done than was ever before known. To
{hew that our commerce did not gain by the
war, he Ihould prove that the commerce of
Neutral Nations had advanced ftill more rapidly.
The Hon. Gentleman here read a variety of
papers, Ihewing the prodigious advances made
of late years by the Swedes, the Danes, but
above all by the Americans. IF we were to
fuller from the peace, it certainly would? be im-
mediately after its arrival; and indeed it had
been faid that our trade had?experienced the
moft complete ftagnation. But the truth was,
that our exports and imports during the quarter
ending the sth of April, exceeded what they
were in the correfponding quarter in the year
1801, always noted for itSprofperitjr. During'
this quarter in 180.x, the,official value of ex-
ports was 5,105,000k the, tea! :value 7,400,000k
During the fame quarter in this, year, the offi-
cial value of exports was 5,365,000k and the
real value 8,343,000k. an increafe of neatly a
million. The imports in the fame proportion.
Sir F. Baring, as a mercantile man, begged
leave to declare it as his lolemn opinion, that
our trade muft fuffer feverely. There were
many articles, fetch as coffee' which we im-
ported to the value of many millions, in which
our trade would now be inconfiderable. There
were others* fetch as tea, which we might re-
tain by our own prudence, but which at prefent'
there was every profpedi.of our lofing, trom
their being taxed to a degree which they were
quite unable to bear.
The 'Chancellor of the Exchequer faid, he had
heard the Hon. Baronet with concern and dif-
appoimment. Without any difrefpedl to him,
he muft flatly deny his petition. Except the
trade to the ceded Illands, we would lofe none
which we now poffefled, and that produced
fcarcely any thing to the revenue, as our own
Colonies fuppiicd our confumption of tea and
fugar, and the produce of the reft was re-ex-
ported to foreign countries. He admitted that
it was necdTary to look with vigilance and cau-
tion to our tea tradfc. But the apprehenlion of
our recurring to the meafure adopted in 1784,
would difeourage fmugglers from renewing
their plans. Belidcs, it mull require years be-
fore they could eftabliih their depots, while in a
few days an Adt might pals fo render all their
fchemes abortive, and to plunge them in irre-
trievable ruin.
Sir E. Earing faid, he did not mean that our
revenue would fall off, hut our trade, and that
our trade would, he folemnly pledged himfei#,
without fear of falfification. Already {hips
were not half the value of which they were Tome
mouths, ago, and oiir tranfit trade was annihi-
lated. However, he thought the Peace would-
not opeiate difadvantageoufly to the general
profperity of the' Country.'
The previous queftien was then carried, and
the Chancellor of the Exchequer?s Refolutions
were put and carried. The Speaker was ex-
cufed from putting them feparately.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved an
Addrefs to his Majefty, praying that he would
be gracioufly pleafed to confer feme dignity, in
the Church upon the Rev. John Barton for his
fcrvices as Chaplain of the Houfe.?Ordered
nem. con.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer then moved
Addreffes to the King, praying him to pay the
following fums :
To Henry Alexander, Efq. Chairman of the
Committee of Ways and. Means, xaool.
To Jeremiah Dyfon, Efq. as Clerk Afliftanf,
as much as will make up his falary to 15,0.0!.
To J. H. Lee, Efq. Second Clerk Afliftanl, a*
much as his Majefty fhall think proper.
To Clemenfon, Efq. Deputy Serjeant
at Arms, as much as will make his emolu-
ments up to 500k
To Mr. Samuel Dunn, towards the expellee of
preparing a general Index to the Journals
from the year 1790 to the period of the
Union, 3001,

(ion, Sol.
For preparing and printing the Index of the pre-
fertt Seffion, 320k
To the Clerks for attending at the Public Com-

To William Drummond,,Efq. the Britilh Ple-
nipotentiary at the Court of his Sicilian
Majefty, to defray the expence of copying
certain ancient manuferipts,, dug up from,
the .ruins ofHerculaneum and Pompeise, 17001
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in moving
this RefoiutJon, laid, he was hire that it would-
rneet with the unanimous concurrence of the
Houle. Thefe valuable manuferipts would have
been inevitably deftroyed had it not been for
the interference of an illuftrious perfonage, who
had ever ihewn the utmoft devotion to the caule
of literature and fciencc. It Certainly would
be worthy of a great and enlightened nation to
fecond his efforts in fuch a caufe. Great pro-
grefs had already been made in copying the ma-
nuscripts, and the whole particulars would next
Seffion be laid before the Houfe.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer afterwards
obferved that he was ferry there was fo thi.ua
Houfe when he was about, to give a very impor-
tant notice. It would be rocoileded that when
the fubjedt of the Civil Lift Debt was before the
Houfe, he had dated that.he meant to bring for-
ward a meafure to prevent its accumulations in
future. He was deeply, concerned that the multi-
plicity of public hulinefs had prevented him from
giving it a fufficient degree of attention to
bring it to maturity. However, it had not been
abandoned, and would be brought forward early-
next Seffion: if not by him, hp trnfted by lonie
other of his Majefly?s fervants. He considered
the?Houfe pledged for it as well as Adminiftra-
tion. He likewife gave notice that a plan would
be fubmittcd.to the Houfe next Seffion, for the
pnrpofe of providing agdinft the dreadful evils
which aroi'e on board of merchant,{hips bn long
voyages.from the want of .chjrurgica! affiftarice.
The Royal College off?hyficians had firft taken
up the fubjedt, and the moft happy effedfs
might be expended to refult from their humane
labours.
Several Accounts being laid upon the table
by the infpedtorof the Cuftoms, the Houfe ad-
journed till to-morrow.
There is 110 Order on the Books, but it is
expedled that there will be a Cpmmiffion to
pafs the Bills now upon the table for the Royal
Affent.


Saturday, June 26.
LONDON.
THE bufinefs in the Houfe of Commons is
quite -finifhed. All the votes for money,
for the expences of the Houfe, &c. which are
ufual at the termination of the Seffion, are
paffed. The Houfe meets this day, but only
for the receiving of Meffages from the Lords,
and attending when the Royal Affent is given
to Bills. The Diffolution is certainly expected
to take place onTuefday next. ??His Majefty
will go in ftate to the Houfe of Lords on Monday.
Among the votes of money this Seffion, there
was one laft night in the Houfe of Commons
of a lingular kind. It was jyool. fur the ex-
pence of MSS. found at Herculaneum audPom-
peiae.
In the courfe of the converfation which
took place at the India Houfe on Wednefday,
on the fubjeCt of Private Trade, it was {bated,
that ina conference between the Directors and
the Earl of Dartmouth, as Prefident of the
Board of Controul, his Lordfhip had difclaim-
ed all intention in the Board of interfering with
the commercial rights of the Company.
M. Otto, it is reported, is to remain in his
'prefent capacity till certain commercial arrange-
ments are formed between the two countries.
In which he is to affift M. Coqucbert Montbret,
the Commiffary for commercial, affairs. What
fliape thefe arrangements will take, is not yet
pofitively known. The plan propofed is faid
to be the renewal of the Commercial Treaty of
j-86. A meeting has already taken place
..between Mr. Addington, Lord Hawke {bury,
and Marquis Cornwallis, on the one fide, and
M. Otto, with M. Coquebert Montbret, on the
other; in which the general outlines of the bu-,
linefs have been difeuffed.
Befides Mr. Talbot, who goes as Secretary
of Legation, Lord Whitworth takes with him
to Paris the Hon. Mr. Pierrepoint, as Private
Secretary. This Gentleman was firft recom-
mended to Lord Hawkefbury?s notice by Lord
St. Helens, who met him at the Emperor?s Co-
ronation at Mofcow,. and was much pltafed
with his talents.
Mr. Jackfon, who was at Paris, is appointed
to the Embaffy at Berlin. Mr. Frere, it is
thought, will be fent from Lifbon to the Court
of Madrid. But nehher the Spanifh nor Bata-
vian Governments have yet nominated to their
Embaffies to Great Britain.
We are informed by Lieutenant Grant, who
Is lately arrived from New South Wales, of the
flourifhing ftate of that Colony. He left Port
Jackfon in November laft, when the crops
wete very luxuriant and beginning to be cut
down, without having fullered that year from
the floods of the Hawkefbury.
Governor Ki g had opened a communication
?with Otaheite for the purpofe of {applying the
colony 1 with pork, in which he had been Angu-
larly fuccefsful, his Majefty?s armed fhip Por-
poife having made one trip, and the Norfolk
brig having fai'ed on the fame employ previous
to Mr. Gram?s leaving Sydney.
The moft friendly underftanding exifts be-
tween the Natives of Otaheite and the Settle-
ment of New South Wales. We are happy to
hear that the latter country is ro longer in want
of a ftaple commodity, the article of coals, of
an excellent kind, being found in abundance in
Jlunter?s River, together with plenty of wood,
well qualified for the matting of {hipping. Mr.
Grant made his paflage to the Cape of Good
Hope, round Ca?pe Horn, in the brig Anna Jo-
fepira, loaded with fpars for marts, and coals,
which latter fold immediately at the Cape at
36 Rix D- liars per ton (nearly 61. fterling).?
The above veflel?s t rp-mafts, top-gal!ant-mafts,
and yards, were of the wood cut in Hunter?s
River, and anfweted remarkably weli._ Mr.
Grant had thus an opportunity of being an
tye-witnefs of its quality; and that was more
particularly proved from the very heavy
weather always met with in thofe feas. Some
fpecimens of this wood he has brought with
him.
Governor King had formed a fmall Settle-
ment at Hunter?s River, for the purpofe of
working the coal which is of the fame nature
with that of Newcaftie.
Mr. Grant entered this River in the Lady
Nelfon, in order to obtain the furvey of it. He
penetrated in his boats nearly feventy miles up
the fame, accompanied by Lieut. Col. Paterfon,
without being able, at that time to difeover its
fource.?A wood refembling fuftick had alfo
been found.
Mr. Grant, in his paflage from England to
Port Jackfon, in the Lady Nellbs, a veflcl of
only 60 tons burthen, with three Aiding keels,
and built on Capt. Schanck?s conftruiflio'n, was,
the-firft that paffed through the Straits which
feparated Van Dieman?s Land from New Hol-
land, and failed along a great extent of coa.ft to
the weftward of any land before feeri by thofe
who had viflted that country, going into no
higher latitude than 39.30. South, and obferves,
that the South Cape of New Holland lies in
39, 2. South. Pie found the Ihore he failed
along bold, with very deep water, wherever he
attempted to land ; and, in general, ha had,
with a very moderate offing, from 30 to 45,
and 30 fathoms water, finefand, and fometimts
(hells.
By order of Governor King, he returned
into thofe Streights, and obtained the furvey of
the coaft from Wilfon?s Promontory to Weftern
Port, with the furvey of that harbour, which is
well fheltered, and capable of containing many
fail of (hipping. There is abundance of wood
eafiiy to be got, and plenty of water; though
the latter is rather difficult to be procured, on
account of the diftance, and from feveral fhoals
lying in the way, which render it neceffary to
take advantage of the tide. Mr. Grant gives a
very favourable report of that part of the coun-
try. 1 The different furveys obtained in the Lady
Nelfon were executed by Enfign Barreilian, of
the New South Wales Corps, who accompanied
him for that purpofe.
Mr. Grant bears ftrong teflimony to the many
good qualities of the Lady Nelfon, and vefiels
built on that conftrufiion, as being particularly
calculated for the bufinefs of difeovery. Their
flatnefs of bottom enables them to approach
nearer the fhore even in bad weather; from
which circumftance, there is lefs liability to be
blown off a coaft.?They can (land into fhoaler
water than {harp built veffels can; and the
great advantage of the keels, which makes them
flay and wear quicker in lefs room, and of more
eaty fteerage ; from all thefe properties leffen-
ing the many dangers to which fuch voyages are
fubjeit.
Notwith(landing the multitude of Literary
Societies which have been inftituted in France,
there are no works of any eminence, which have,
recently made their appearance there.
The Public Library a: Paris is one of the,
fineft Collections of Books Jn the world?per-
haps the fineft ?and is rendered of real fervice,
from the facility with which every one may pro-
cure the works he may have occafion toconfult.
Strangers are greatly furprifed to find the tables
appropriated to the Public, furrounded by Un-
dents of allages and of both foxes?of alldeicrip-
tions, and of all ranks: fathers teaching their
children; Profeffors of Law poring over the
hidden treafures of the Jurisconfults; Hifto-
rians quoting authorities; and Divines eftablilh-
ing the proofs of miracles.
There are mote than three hundred thoufand
volumes of printed books, collected fince the
time of Charles V. more than four hundred
years ago, which occupy three (kies of the
building, an extent of about fifteen hundred
toifes.
In one of the Galleries is the ? French Parnaf-
fus,? or reprefentation, in bronze, of the fa-
mous mountain upon the Tides of which are the
figures of the moft celebrated Authors: Ra-
cine, Corneille, Boffuet, Voftairc,. Rouffeaii,
See. See. are confpicuous. A Temple is placed
at the top of the Mount; the Mufesj and other
emblematical figures are near it, and Pegaftis
upon its fuihrait.
There are two enormous Glebes placed in
one of the apartments, which were made by the
Jefuit Coronelli, for the Cardinal d?Ellrees, in
IOS3.
The Gallery of Manufcripts contains about
thirty thoufand, the greateft part of which are,
written, upon the Hiftory of France, and parti-
cularly fir.ee the Reign-of Lewis XL Twenty-
five thoufand of thefe Manufcripts are in foreign
languages. ,
There are five rooms upon the fecond floor,
which, contain Titles and Genealogies in about
five thoufand boxes, and portfolios.
The .Cabinets of Medals and'of Antiques
are beyond meafure rich and interefting; the
latter were chiefly collected by the celebrated
Caylus. ' . ?
There are about five thoufand volumes of
Engravings, divided into twelve olaffes. The
Portrait, of King John is tolerably well pre-
ferred, and fhewn as- the firft example of Paint-
ing in France.
COVENT-GARBEM THEATRE. ,
The fcafon at this Theatre was laffc night
clofed. Mr. Lewis, in a fhort fpeech, addreff.
Ed the audience, thanking them for the very
ample lhare of patronage which the proprietors
had experienced, and exprefling, in his own
name and that of the reft of the performers,
gratitude _ for the kindnefs, indulgence, and
favour which they had at all times experienced.
The late feafen has, we believe, been one of
the moft fuccefsiul ever known at this Theatre.
HAY-MARKET THEATRE.
This Theatre opened laft evening under very
favourable aufpices. The Manager has difeo-
vered much judgment in the fdeClion of Per-
formers from both the Winter Theatres, thoegh
the abfence of a-few who formed part of
the company laft ftafon, may be a good deal
regretted by the public. Among the additions
to the company, the principal are Mr. Murray,
Mrs. St. Ledger, Mrs. Harlowe, and Mifs
Howells. Perhaps it may be thought that thefe
will hardly ccmpeniate for the le.fi, of inch fa-
vourite performers, as Mr. and Mrs. H. Jofin-
fton and Mrs. Gibbs, who, we underhand, are
not engaged for the prefent f Ton. The Com-
pany, however, as how constituted, is very
refpeCtable, and affords a very tolerable variety
for the call of characters, both in the comic and
tragic departments. In the con. c lire, indeed,
the (Length of company has fir tk ted no dimi-
nution ; report fiys, that the Manager has riot
been lefs attentive in providing for the novelty
of the entertainments. Several new Pieces anj
underftood to be in preparation, and, abridged
as the fcafon now is, they will fucceed each
other at very (hort intervals?The favourite
Comedy of The Heir at Law was laft night
prefented with dome change in the cart of the
characters, but with no decreafe of its attrac-
tion,?The changes which have taken place, are
not we think on the whole very, favourable.
Henry Morland is not rendered fp interefting in
the hands of Mr. De Camp as in thofe of , the
original reprefentative; nor do we think that
Mrs. Harlowe, as Cicely Uonefpun , difeovered ao
adequate degree of rultic limpfieity.
In the entertainment of the Wags of Windfor,
Mrs. St. Ledger made her firft appearance as
Grace Gayt-ve whfch (he (Vipported with cha-
raCteriltic vivacity; and the other characters
were admirably fupported by their former ttf-
prefentatives. With the provifion which the
Manager has made for the amufement of the
Public, we have no doubt but he will be igi.
compenfed by a liberal {hare of patronage.


June 24-?2 6.
THE LONDON CHRONICLE for 1802.
Court of King?s Bench, Jam i 4.
Lewis v. Peacock.
This was an artion to recover the fum of 238!.
for work and labour, in making a water-wheel
for the defendant?s mill at Stratford, upon a
new conftrudtion. The mill was fit u a ted on a
branch of the River Lea, where the water va-
ries very much in its depth at the different
tides, by which reafon the mil! in queftion was
frequently prevented from working. The great
queftion in the caufc was, what was the con-
trail the plaintiff had undertaken? On the part
of the plaintiff it was infilled that he had only
undertaken to conllrudl a new wheel, which
Should enable the mil! to work two hours of
the tide fooner than it could do on the old
ConO.ru flion.
Jof. Bioyp, the manager of the plaintiff?s
bufiriefs, Hated, that this was the contrart he
had undertaken. This was done by inferring a
water-wheel, which was to be elevated or de-
preffed, according to the height of the tide, (A
model was introduced to exhibit the mode of
its operation). He /aid he faw it at work af-
terwards, and that it performed according to
his expeditions. It worked in the month of
November, when from the (late of the flood,
all the neighbouring mills could not work at all.
Several other witneffes, chiefly mili-wrights,
were called, who dated that the new wheel was
a great improvement.
On the part of the defendant, it was con-
tended, that fo far from being an improvement,
it was a great deterioration to the mill, and
that upon an average it performed lefs.
To prove this, the defendant?s fervant was
called i he dated, that although it worked at
flood tides, yet on other occafions it had a very
inferior power. When it was firft fet to work
it' would not deliver the goods, to obviate
which, they were obliged to cut the mill-ftones
in a new manner, and the corn was not pro-
perly ground. The bran contained a great deal
of flour, which arefe from a want of ftrength
in the mill to grind it properly.
This flatement was alfo confirmed by a Mr.
Jacobs, a miller, who faid that he had bought
a great deal of the bran from that mill, which
contained fo much flour, that he thought it
worth bis while to grind it over again.
A number of mili-wrights were then called
on the part of the defendant,, who agreed in
Hating that the work was not well dtfigned,
and particularly pointed out that the wheel was
not half the diameter it ought to have been,
to obtain the neceffai.y power.
Qns of thefe witneffes for the defendant, was
a very fat roan, which induced the Learned
Coatjfel to obfjrve, ? Your trade feems a more
thriving One than our?s.? ??? Aye, Sir,? re-
plied he. ? ffde fieep found in our beds.?
The Learned Judge having detailed the evi-
dence,' tql'd the Jury that there were fome
among them more competent to decide than he
was. The Jury accordingly withdrew for fome
time, .and then returned a verdid for the plain-
tiff. Damages, 1501.
PORTLAND-PLACE BANKING CONCERNS.
In conftquence of a Commiflion of Bankrupt-
cy having been iffbed againft R. W. Felton
Lathropp, otherwife Sir Robert Murray Blown
Clarke, late of Portjand-place, Banker, co-
partner with T. Levefon Prefcott, otherwife
called Levefon Prefcott,. and John King, late of
the famc- place. Bankers, the firft meeting un-
der the Commiflion was held at Guildhall on
Tuefday laft. The firft debt attempted lo be
proved was one for 419!. 16s. 6d. brought for-
ward againft the bankrupt by John King, being
the amount of a bill, contaiving.various items. � l! '?"} ordtr to
Mr. Agar, as Counfel for Lathropp, faid he 1" r be, n tl ? fuch property had
mud. in the firft p'lw. nhie.H tn rhi- nrni-wif. K � advai ]Ced that if a had, it muft have
muft, indite firft place, objert to this proceed-
ing altogether. Here was one of the partners in
a firm, who brought forward a number of (ham
been given to King previous to the commence-
ment of the partnerflup?and, if after the efta-
a hrm, woo ocongnt rorvvara a number or mam ii - . a. x a i. , w "
claims, as he Ihould prove them to be, againft u- 1 ' i* �: Viw 1 anc^
ann of the nartner* for the fraudulent nur , � c ' ,en t individually, muft be liable to the
ano her of the partners, tor the fraudulent pur debt- Mr. Agar then contended, that this was
pofe of depriving the real and bona fide credi-
tors of Mr. Lathropp, of what was juftly due
to them. For if thefe fidtitious claims of King
were allowed, there would be nothing left for
the real creditors.
The Commiflioners thought it proper to en-
ter into the conllderation of the items of the
bill. One of thefe was the fum of 371. xos. for
fix weeks board in King?s houfe. This demand
was allowed, although Lathropp declared that
he had boarded only a month, and that many
of the dinners he partook of with King were in
-Confequence of invitations. Other items were
for money lent, .and out of the bill of 419!.
16s. 6d. no more than 1881. 4 s. 6d. was allow-
ed. The remaining claims the Commiflioners
wquld not rtjtdl, but laid they mutt fufpend
them until they were fubftantiated by better
evidence than King could then produce. Of
theft claims, one was a fum paid for the ufe of
Lathropp, for advertifing in the papers in an-
fwer to Mr. Jefferys. Mr. Agar aiked King if,
in that anfwer, he did not endeavour to vindi-
cate his own character, and the charafler of the
Bankmg-houfe, and then put it to the Commif-
hoiiers whether it was not money expended for
the ufe of the firm, and not for any individual
partner in it. King anfwered, that the money
was laid out folely for the ufe of Lathropp, for
that he would not himfelf have anfwered the
attack made by Mr. Jefferys. Another item
'rf rii r ~l onary to 3 confiderable amount,
rhe Counfel contended that this was generally
for the ufe of the bankmg-houfe, and not for
Mr. Lathropp?s private ufe. King fvvore that
he fent it all to Sir Robert Murray, and he con-
lidercd it as applied to his ufe folely ; and Lath-
ropp fwore that he knew no more about it than
ot its having been fent to the banking-houfe fu-
tile ufe of the partners. Other parts of the bill
were for Aims of money which King fwore he
had advanced to Lathropp, and which the other
as pofitively fvvore not to have been given for
his ufe. There was an items,to a confiderable
amount for (lamps, which King faid he had
(up pi led Sir Robert with, but which the other
faid he had given to the Stationer, and not one
of which he had converted to his own ufe.
Tneie was alfo an item for money to defray the
expences attending the changing of Lathropp?s '
name. King faid that Lathropp had had no
money at all, and that on every occafion he had
been obliged to fupply him with whatever he
wanted. To many of the claims Lathropp
faid, he could make fets off; and feveral farts .
fworn to by King, he pofitively denied on his !
oath.
Mr. Agar- again contended, that one partner I 1
had no right to raife up claims like thefe againft i
another, and that Ihould itch a precedent be ( ?
once e(labl i Hied, it would be a recipe for frauds !
of every kind to the molt unlimited extent. I 1
The Commiflioners faid, that as feme of the I
items were admitted, and as others appeared to I ?
be for the private ufe of Lathropp, they muft be I J
allowed, and all the others fufpended.
King faid, that befides this bill, be had. fur-)
tier demands on Sir Robert Murray, amount- I r
ing to upwards of 7 0001. But the confidera-
tion of thefe was put off to a future day. R
The next perfon who came to prove.his debt �
was the Petitioning Creditor, an Jrilhman, *
named Gil!, who dated himfelf ro be a Linen- d
merchant, refiding at No. 6, in Oxendon-ftreet. v.
He fwore that be had advanced the bankrupt
the lum of 300!. in conflderatio.u of which he ft
waato be allowed to draw on, the bank to the
amount 0f,6001. About 70].. of the 3001. was *
advanced,in linen, the reft in money. Lathropp f?
a i u: ? 1 ? v . 1 ? * ?lit?
dented his having received this property, and ( ,
Mr. Agar crofs-exarriined Gill, in order to fhew,
I a fid/tious demand, and faid, that this Mr,
Gill, who called himfelf a Linen-merchant, was
1 a m an whofe refidence could not be found, for
when perfons went to inquire after him in Ox-
endon-ftreet, where he represented himfelf as
having a warehoufe and a lodging, the anfwer
made was that no fuch perfon lived there.
The further confideration of Gill?s depofition
wa � poftponed, the Commiflioners obferving-
that other evidence mud be given before they
could allow fuch a claim. ?
The Bankrupt?s marriage fettlement was
then produced, in order to fhew that ;he
14,000!. which belonged to his wife was fettled
on her, and therefore was not liable to his debts :
but on account of the abfence of witneffes ne-
ceflary to prove the due execution of the deed,
the confederation of it was deferred.
Lathropp declared, that all this bufinefs
was an attempt to deprive him of his property.
The Commiflioners? recommended it to him to
fend m a petition immediately to the Lord Chan
cellor ; in which cafe they had no doubt but
that his Lord (hip would fuperfede the commif-
lion that was iflued againft him.
