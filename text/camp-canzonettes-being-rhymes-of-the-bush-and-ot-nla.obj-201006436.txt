DEDICATION
TO
M. U.
If I have ever struck a note,
Of gentle thought or softer tone ;
It is because the thought of you
Has never left me quite alone.
And grateful for that influence sweet,
Through all these long and toilsome times ;
While we were fated not to meet,
I now inscribe to you these rhymes.


PREFATORY NOTE.
I have been so frequently asked for copies of my humble
compositions, that, with many misgivings, I have decided
to print them. I know too well what real poetry is, to
claim any merit for them, but their compilation has
served to wile away some spells of idleness for me, and
it is possible that their perusal may here and there do
the same for other persons.
F. C. U.
Cloncurry, 1891.


Camp Canzonettes.
Carpentaria to Leicbbardt.
•hough, honoured lost one, on thy deafened ear
The voice of mortal minstrel ne’er may sound,
And in thine unknown grave thou canst not hear
Thy praises that through all the land resound—
And though the trackless bush may still conceal
The secret of thy silent resting place,
And though untiring search might not reveal
The forest spot thy lonely grave doth grace—
Still shall the memory of thy great deeds done,
With pity blent for thy mysterious fate,
Constrain posterity to rank thee one
High placed among Australia’s brave and great.
So from this land, which in the bygone times
Thou with thy following wert first to tread,
Let there be placed on record these poor rhymes,
As humble tribute to the valiant dead !


The Night Watch.
'yjpSf She “ Boss ” has turned in and is fast asleep,
C/ -S4 Two horses around are tramping ;
Their riders, two men in cabbage-tree hats,
Are silently watching the travelling “ fats ”
As the mob is quietly camping.
Poker Jem has allowed his thoughts
Backward to go a-roving,
To the routine flush that took him down,
And forced him forthwith to clear from town.
And go once more a-d roving.
Gentleman Jack is thinking of home
And the girl he ought to have married,
And the kind of a man he might have been
If the mess he got into had been foreseen,
And his life had not all miscarried.
Jem reckons that he’s had darned hard luck,
And consigns to several places
The fellow who cleaned him out with a smile.
When he stood to win such a tidy pile
On his hand, which held four aces.
Jack thinks that the ways of the world are queer,.
And its tips and downs are curious;
There’s a kind of happiness everywhere;
The majority don’t much know or care
If its true or if its spurious.


Crack ! goes a branch from that old dead tree,
And with instantaneous rattle,
Two thousand feet strike the gravelly ground,
And with one thundering rush of sound
Away go the frightened cattle.
Gone are the thoughts of the gambling game,
And the sentimental musing,
As they ride for their lives, to save the loss
Of the mob behind, they can hear the “ Boss ”
All created things abusing.
A rattling gallop they have in the dark,
No thought of their danger taking,
They wheel them at last on the homeward track,
And with patient driving they bring them back
As daylight is slowly breaking.


Told by the camp Fire.
“ Blacks ! ” you was saying, was you 1
|lpf Well, if you ain’t got no call
tj Ujji To speak on ’em any different,
Don’t mention ’em at all.
For it ’alius riles me somehow,
To hear you chaps from South
A-talking to us old bushmen,
With soft sawder in yer mouth.
And if yer think I’m blowin’
Without no reason, why
I’ll give yer my own true story,
God knows that I don’t lie.
It were early in the eighties,
Not many years ago,
But exactly what the date is,
I don’t jest rightly know.
For where we lived were lonesome,
And Sal—my wife—and I
Most often took no notice
Jest how the days slipped by.
And I’d got a nurse from the township
(By the name of Mrs. Mogg)
Who took no heed of nothing,
Without ’twere a drop of grog.


For Sal, you see, were in trouble,
As comes to the most of wives ;
And women likes women near ’em,
At them per’ods of their lives.
I ain’t got much book-learnin’,
And I ain’t prepared to say
If that kid knowed its future,
When it were born that day.
But it squawked and cried most ’orful,
And better men nor me
Says kids is wise, becos’ they cries
The minit they can see.
And Sal seemed real happy,
Tho’ lookin’ ’orful white ;
And when she showed the kid to me,
Her eyes, with love, was bright.
And when I rode off next mornin’
To where the cattle ran,
I thought of that look she give me,
And I felt a better man.
I found the blacks had bin there,
And had broken up the mob;
And to get them put together
Give me a longish job.


So agin’ I got to the slip rails
’Twere about this time at night;
And it struck me then as queerish,
That I couldn’t see no light.
I rode up past the stockyard,
And unsaddled in the dark ;
And I ses to myself as I done it—
“ Why don’t them blamed dogs bark 1 ”
I walked up to the humpy
And through the open door,
And fell, tripped up by somethin’
As lay upon the floor.
I ses—‘Sal ! why, what’s the matter V
And then I strikes a light;
O God ! to think a man should look
On such a ’orful sight.
Sal were a-lyin’ foremost—
With her head agin’ the door—
All cut and hacked to pieces,
And her life-blood on the floor.
The nurse were a-lyin’ sideways—
Half on, half off, the bed;
They had left her legs and body,
And had took away her head.


And the kid were there, half roasted
In the fireplace at the side;
I’ve alius hoped he weren’t put there
Afore his mother died.
It ain’t no use me tryin’
To say how I spent that night;
I were glad when it were over,
And I saw the mornin’ light.
The troopers came that evenin’
And helped me dig the holes;
And their officer read a prayer or two—
As he said was good for souls.
And then I took my rifle
And foller’d ’em straight away—
For the troopers said they knew the camp,
And could reach it afore next day.
And at break of day next mornin’
We was there afore the sun—
Planted all round about their camp
So’s we couldn’t lose e’er a one.
There was eight of them native troopers,
And me and their boss made ten ;
And the mercy them devils gave to Sal
Were the mercy we showed then.


I have heercl a lot of playin’
On piannys and organs too •
But the music of them there rifles
Were the sweetest I ever knew.
It’s all passed now, and over,
And to be resigned I tries ;
But my heart’s up there to the nor’ard
Where Sal and her baby lies.
’Tis a plaguey wood this box-wood,
And do make a ’orful smoke;
So ’scuse me mate, I’ll shift my seat
Or I’m blow’d if I won’t choke !


A Bush Casablanca.
tLL night the fire liatl raged,
And when the day was born,
The beaters stayed awhile—thirst unassuaged,
’ Harassed and worn.
For half the foregone day,
And through the starlit night,
While o’er the burning downs the fire held sway,
They’d waged the fight.
And one slim youth was there,
Over whose bright brave head
Had passed but few of England’s summers fair,
Where he was bred.
In the front rank all through,
As well became his birth,
He fought as ever true born heroes do,
O’er all the earth.
The “Boss” had marked him so,
And thus to him did say,
“ Be careful now, my lad, and take it slow,
’Tis the best way.”
“ I’m starting to the well
For water as you see,
It’s better now that you should have a spell,
So come with me,”


But he replied “No, no,
I cannot go away,
You see the blazing flames are raging so,
And I must stay.”
Ahead then raged the fire ;
With red magnificence lit up the sky,
As if alive, and mad with the desire,
Its strength to try.
And he again in front,
With flail upraised in hand,
For boyish honour’s sake bearing a brunt,
He could not stand.
Hard men were there and tough,
By Austral suns well tried,
And most of them confessed they’d had enough,
Which none denied.
And now they stood around,
Beaten by drought, and sad,
Till one gave out a hoarse and thirsty sound,
Like, “ Where’s the lad V’
Ah, where 1 Full three miles back,
Along the Fire-King’s way,
There on the seared, scorched, blackened track,
The youngster lay.


Exhaustion’s work was done,
He raved, and smiled, in pain;
And as he raved, and smiled, and said “The fight is won!”
God sent His rain.
The fire was quenched indeed,
And slaked the burning thirst,
But the bright, brave, young life had now no need—
It went out first.
“ Ah, Avell,” said Sailor Jack,
“ These new-chums be too soft;
But mates, there ain’t no call for us to wish him back ;
He’s gone aloft.”


Sunrise
Weight ! beautiful, and still! and all around
J nil S °H efful S ence s^ >
j [W// All Nature’s myriad voices make no sound,
Heaven’s diamonds gleam o’erhead.
And as the God-lit lamps of beauteous night
Sink lower in the sky ;
In the far East, a faint gray light
Proclaims the day is nigh !
Whilst may be heard the curlew’s shrill salute,
That heralds the approach of roseate dawn;
And all the voices, hitherto so mute,
Awake with melody to hail the morn.
And as the stars, that decked the midnight skies,
Are fading, one by one ;
Bathed in red radiance all the landscape lies,
Waiting the morning sun.
Then rising from the East, in majesty of light,
The glorious orb of day
Sends as his messengers, his sunbeams bright,
To chase the shades away.


Eventide.
8 mellow softening of the summer sky ;
A glory in the West;
The time of peace and silence drawing nigh.
With tranquil sense of rest.
A quiet, gradual, hushing of all sound ;
A stillness in the trees ;
An ending to the day’s laborious round,
In gentleness and ease.
The crimson beauties deepen in their glow.
To speed the parting sun ;
As if a radiant gratitude to show,
For the day’s work well done.
At our life’s sunset, ere the spirit goes
Back to the Hand that gave,
May lustre of good deeds illume its close
With brightness to the grave.


An Old Legend
once perused an ancient scroll,
ID Much stained with dust of bygone ages;
tj I With many an old worm-eaten hole
Piercing its venerable pages.
It told how in the Holy Land,
A handsome, young, and gay Crusader ;
Once sought a Jewish damsel’s hand,
Woo’d her, and won, and then betrayed her.
And how an aged father’s curse
Followed that knight, in fight or revel ;
So that he went from bad to worse,
And drank and fought like any devil.
Till once against the heathen host,
When Christian trumps the charge had sounded;
Our knight, being first at danger’s post,
Fell from his war-horse, sorely wounded.
Borne by retainers from the fray,
W T here Turk and Christian erst contended ;
He reached his tent, and swooned away,
Thinking, in sooth, his life was ended.
And when he came to life again,
With brain all dull and heavy laden;
Lathing his head, to soothe his pain,
Stood his forsaken Jewish maiden.


“Rebecca, child ! what dost thou here 1 ?”
The prostrate gallant feebly muttered ;
In sad, low tone, yet sweet and clear,
Came the reply the maiden uttered :
“ Whither thou goest, there go I,
E’en though to drink of Marah’s waters ;
Should great Jehovah rule thou die,
Faithful to death are Jacob’s daughters.”
The knight got well, despite the curse,
And when the Paynim power was broken
He Christianised his faithful nurse,
And nuptial vows by both were spoken.
And from this strangely coupled pair,
In whom the East and West were blended ;
The pages of my scroll declare
A Noble House is still descended.


Federation.
TF hear the tramp of armed men,
I hear the rolling drums ;
q And “Forward ! Forward !” is the cry,
As rank by rank now filing by,
Britannia’s army comes.
Old Albion’s sons march proudly first,
Heroes of many a fight;
Their blazoned banner heavenward streams,
And still the ancient motto gleams—
“ May God defend the right.”
Then Canada’s staunch woodland sons,
To swell the muster go,
With martial mien and steadfast feet,
Right gallantly they pass to meet
Our Federal Empire’s foe.
I hear the stroke of iron shod hoof,
I see bright tulwars shine,
And India’s swarthy squadrons ride,
In blaze of Oriental pride
To join the battle’s line.
And from far Afric’s golden shore
Come on more warrior bands ;
Ready in brotherhood to clasp,
Or in stout grip their weapons grasp
With true-bred British hands.


And hark ! with what a lusty cheer,
Borne on the swelling breeze,
Australia’s “ boys ” now take their place,
Young scions of the grand old race
From far Pacific seas.
See ! the old Lion lifts his head
At sound of war’s alarms,
And proudly bids his foes beware,
For “Greater Britain” well may dare
To front the world in arms !
Thauson D'Amour.
HALL I forget 1 ? Not while life’s breath
Glows through each pulsing vein.
iKsvJ Shall I forget 1 ? e’en when sharp death
Severs life’s silver skein ?
Beyond them both I shall remember yet;
In life, nor death, shall I forget! shall I forget!
Now, and hereafter, love is dear,
Though saddened with regret;
Nor in dark days, all lonely, drear,
Shall I ray love forget.
No ! still for aye my love lives with me yet;
Nor now, nor then, shall I forget! shall I forget!


The Maiden and the Flower.
he walked within a pleasant garden plot,
Musing upon her lover, absent o’er the sea ;
And pausing, stayed where the forget-me-not
“ In fairy wildness there was blooming free.
“ O flower of simple faith and truth,” she cried,
“ No rarer plant but you shall my companion be ;
In mine own chamber, now, you shall abide
In token that my love forgets not me.”
With care she culled the dainty, gracious flower,
Love’s labour used to shield it from all harm ;
Gave it high place within her maiden’s bower,
Surrounding it with all love’s sacred charm.
And there she tended it with soft, sweet ways,
Saying, as it grew and bloomed within its pot—
“ O dearest flower, what joys you bring my days,
I know, by you, my love forgets me not.”
A letter came from a far distant shore,
Telling of war and hero-fights in other lands;
Telling, alas ! her lover was no more,
But dead, of desperate wounds from savage hands.
And as the stricken maiden, weeping, lay,
For one fleet moment she upraised her drooping head;
And gazed upon her flower that erst was blithely gay,
And lo! there in its pot, the flower was sere and dead.


A Birthday Massage.
tLEASANT are Austral’s forest glades,
When the wattle is in bloom ;
And pleasant in a far-off land,
The heather and the broom.
Cheerily in the radiant morn,
The jackass laughs with glee ;
And cheerily the skylark sings
In the dear old home, to thee.
Some gift to every spot of earth,
All-bounteous Nature gave ;
Music and beauty everywhere,
In cloud, in wind, or wave.
I send my song across the sea,
To greet you on this day ;
And cloud, and wind, and wave, all three
Shall speed it on its way.
For Nature loves all lovely things,
But far beyond, above
All other lovely things, she loves
That lovely thing called Love.


To Grief.
jJSlgs grief ! wherever love hath laid
M [ll His touch on human hearts ;
Thou art his self-appointed shade,
% c To stay, when he departs.
Thou lingerest ever with us, when
Beauty and joy have fled ;
Eternal in the hearts of men,
For thou art never dead.
When memory love’s requiem sings,
Thou join’st the sad refrain ;
With mournful echoing that brings
A note of deeper pain.
O thou twin sister of Despair,
Fell enemy of bliss ;
Say ! in the next world, art thou there
Eternal, as in this 1
Or shall the human soul defy,
By grace of light Divine,
The darker depths of misery,
Whose greatest power is thine ;
And in the realms of purest grace,
Fraught with celestial joy,
Finding that there thou hast no place,
Taste Love without alloy 1


A Twiligt Dream.
: |W ¥: dreamed, as I sat in the twilight,
if Of faces and days long gone ;
t | Ere Time’s heavy hand passed o’er me,
iLs.
And left me to mourn alone.
Ah ! the pain of recollection,
The sadness that memory brings ;
Ah ! the bitterness of reflection
On those loved, dead, bygone things.
I saw my love, as I knew her
When our days were all fresh and young;
And her heart and mine to each other
Their love songs all blithely sung.
But the joy of that time has left me,
Nor can earthly power restore
The peace of which grief has bereft me,
Since those halcyon days of yore.
The darkening shades close round me,
Gathers night’s dusky pall;
And heavily on my spirit
Old sorrowful memories fall.
It is Nature’s hour of mourning
For the death of another day ;
Her grief will pass ; but my pain, alas !
Shall lie on my soul alway.


The Sea.
»rom the days of my youth I have loved the sea,
With its might, and magic, and mystery ;
L l hA? When the mountain waves of the tempest roar,
~And when laughing ripples but kiss the shore.
As Nature in wrath made manifest,
As an emblem of quiet eternal rest;
A charm for the soul that would fain be free,
Is held in the depths of the wondrous sea.
When the days of this labouring life are past,
And the sweet long rest has been reached at last,
I pray that kind fortune may grant my grave
To be near to the friendly and sounding wave.
For though it is said we may live no more,
And that this life gone all lives are o’er;
The passing of death would be made less drear,
If I knew that ray life-long friend was near.


Requiescant in Aeternum.
“QUETTA,” 1890.
SOR ever, they shall rest,
Silent within the deep blue waters’ bed ;
For ever, till in time at God’s behest
-“The sea gives up its dead.”
Parent and child lie there,
Lover, and friend —in one dread doom of death ;
No requiem but the moaning of the wave a-near
Borne on the night-wind’s breath.
Sorrow, sad hearts, alas !
And grieve for loss we left behind must know ;
Yet think that those who through Death’s portals pass.
Have gain, not loss, to show.
Beneath the silver sea—
There let them lie in everlasting peace ;
Till things of time and place shall no more be,
And all save love shall cease.


The Light Upon the Sea.
FOR MUSIC.
gazed one clay from my casement
On a dark and stormy sea ;
’ The waters surged beneath the murk,
And the wind blew wild and free.
As I looked forth on the tempest,
At the clouds, and the sea below ;
I thought of the gloom of human life,
And the storm and stress we know.
From a rift in the farther heavens
Came a ray of beaming light ;
It pierced through the lowering storm clouds,
And a space on the sea was bright.
I said—“ Oh, most happy token !
It is thus that by grace above,
The darkest life may be brightened
By one ray of the Light of Love.”


At Morn-At Noon-At Eve.
T ? said to my love at the dawning,
P[ “Arise, love, and come with me,
■* To gather the flowers of morning,
That are fresh and fair like thee.”
And the lark was carolling far above
His songs of happiness, joy, and love,
And the music fell from the vault on high,
As a welcome to her from the morning sky.
I said to my love at the noon-day,
Oh, stay, love, and rest thee here,
In this fair green glade by Nature made
For the child she holds most dear.
And the sunlight glinted beneath the shade,
As she rested with head on her nosegays laid ;
And the bright beams played with her golden hair,
As if they had found their sisters there.
I cried to my love at evening,
Oh, love, leave me not alone,
Oh, plead for me to be joined with thee,
Where thou standest near the Throne.
And the cypress is waving to and fro,
O’er the grave where my hopes are lying low,
And an angel is echoing far away,
The song of the skylark at break of day.


A Request.
eave me not here in my solitary sorrow,
|]| Lonely to brood on the past that is Hed,
-j Striving from worldly surroundings to borrow
' A glimpse of my Jiappiness long ago dead.
What though in moments of hasty misfeeling,
I wounded you sore in the heat of my pride,
And my anger, my love, from your sight was concealing,
Still deep in my heart doth your image abide.
And loyal and pure is the feeling I cherish,
For you who from all I had chosen my own,
And though from your heart my poor image may perish,
From mine yours no changes can ever dethrone.
Then let me at least have the solace of knowing,
One city, one country, shall shelter us twain,
And perhaps in the human tide’s ebbing and flowing,
Some thrice blessed chance shall unite us again.


Courage!
is life !
And far more cloud than brightness
jfj |)V Attends each on his way ;
Yet courage, brothers, keep some heart of lightness
To greet the coming day.
Awesome is death !
And heavy with dark fearing
Of what is yet to be ;
Still, keep good trust that we may find the clearing
Most beautiful to see.
For though our thoughts,
Perplexed in fog and dulness,
Still end in doubt at best;
Death brings to all his certainty, with fulness,
To set that doubt at rest.
And surely day
Shall come, with glory breaking
Upon the souls of men ;
Of life’s sad “ now,” the very memory taking
To be the unknown “ then.”
Wherefore be brave !
And ready with glad starting
To tend each one his call ;
Knowing, that then for thee the clouds are parting,
And there is light for all.


The Eavesdropper.
neaking at night with a felon’s tread,
' Picking up words all lightly said ;
Construing evil where none has place,
“ The incarnation of all most base.
The vilest of caitiffs beneath the sun,
Traitor and coward, joined in one ;
Nurturing malice and venomed spite,
Society’s bane, and friendship’s blight.
Writhing your way in snake-like style,
With heart of treason steeped in guile;
Breathing half-truths with poisonous lies,
Fit object for reptiles to despise.
O toad, and viper, of meanest soul,
It is hard to conceive your final goal;
But should they not scorn you in deepest hell.
You will surely be shut in a “separate cell.”
