one person, then rode cm to Mr. Wilson’s. —lI.H. Tasmania.
In future the Holy Communion will ho celebrated hero and at Mr. Uroadwin’.s .-us often as possible.
The Jiishop of Tasmania earnestly hopes that those at least to whom ho can speak with authority, namely, members of the Church of Kngland, will remember to
make a distinction between Sunday and the week days. There tire children growing up hero and round the lake whom we are trying to bring up in godliness ; and to that
end, wo are inculcating upon them all the ordinances of the church. It would be sad to believe that the example of fishermen and travellers is to be a silent hindrance in
place of an aid to their spiritual life. —H.H.T.

On Tuesday, March 9th, a bitter cold day, with constant
I he above record was never filled up, and has never been finished owing to the sad calamity
snow showers. Poor Mr. Seal left Earley’s House, where
mentioned on this page.
he was staying with Col. Cox, the Governor having left
on the previous Monday, 4th March, about 1 p.m., and took
the boat and rowed across the Lake to shore opposite house. As he did not return by about 7, Earley, at Col. Cox's re-
quest, went riding iound the Lake. He left his horse, at fence nnder Murderer’s Hill, and on foot followed the shore
of the Lake, having a lighted lantern. He first came on a fish evidently freshly caught, then on the boat. In it was
Mr. Seal’s rod, and beside the boat close to
it he lay stone dead, his head and chest out of the water, which
covered his legs. Earley, finding he was stone dead, rowed across the Lake, and taking Harris back, riding with him,
they placed the body in the boat, which Earley rowed across the Lake with. Col. Cox. sent up telegrams of sad news
the bame night, and himself brought the remains
down to Hobart ten days afterwards. Mr. Seal was an indefatigable
most perfect fisherman, and was most deeply interested in fishing in all its branches. He was chairman of the
Board of Fisheries, a sterling, good, upright, and most unselfish man, one who never said a bad word of, or harsh
word to, anyone. He was universally loved by all, high and low. He died pursuing the sport he was devoted to. May
he rest m peace.
J. Catlicart, W. IT. Valont ine, R. Ilcadlam, H. C. Hallowes.—Arrived March 14th.—During the whole stay, up to March 24th, a succession of westerly and S. W. gales
with snow ; hail, rain, and sleet prevailed. No fish to be seen anywhere, and consequently a bad catch. Total catch, 21 fish ; weighing 1641bs.; largest, 13^lbs.
Catlicart and Irvine.—15th to 18th April.—Generally good fishing weather, but water very thick (liquid mud). Only 6 fish, weighing 351b.; no fish to be seen.
Captain Smith.—Camped at Beehives. —One fish, lOlbs.
April.—Thomas Carr. —Caught 7 fish, weight 691bs.: 61bs., 71bs., 81bs., IHlbs., ll-J-lbs., 121bs., 131bs. Lake very thick, unfit for fishing, fine day when a little clearer
took 4 fish —401bs. Weather very dry. Water very low. No fish to be seen anywhere.

H. W. Bryant,—December 28th, ’O7, to January 12th, ’OB—A most unsatisfactory trip so far as the fishing was concerned. During the whole lime the water in the lake
was much discolored. The weather was either bright and calm or very boisterous from W. or N. The lish were not on the feed take and very few were to be seen —those
taken appeared to be stragglers. During the greater part of my stay, Messrs. Giblin, Burnside, and Hall were also fishing, as was Capt. Owen, for 3or t days. They were
equally unlucky. My total take was C fish, weighing 50J-lb. —the worst trip [ have bad.

Constable Earley tells me this is a record month for heat. The
fish have as a rule been absent in deep water, or off the take.
The watcV is so discolored in the lake with a north wind
that the fish cannot see a yard in front of them. We have
had some very good day’s sport nevertheless, and have en-
joyed the visit. Mr. and Mrs. Earley have, as usual, been
most obliging, and we have been very comfortable.
