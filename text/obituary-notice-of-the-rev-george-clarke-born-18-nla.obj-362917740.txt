Rev. George Clarke
Death —On March 10, 1913, at his residence, ‘ Summerhome/ Moonah,
Hobart, Rev. George Clarke, Congregational Minister, in his
90th year.
the life-long intimate friend of the late
Rev. George Clarke, I have been requested
to write his obituary notice for insertion in
the pages of the Congregational Year Book,
and I have consented to do so. It is not
possible for me to write of my beloved Pastor and friend
in the formal manner of obituary notices in general, giving-
only what may be termed his official record, for his great
and beneficient influence throughout the community and
the State, during his long pastorate of 5 2 years, was due,
quite as much to the man, George Clarke, as to the Minister,
Rev. George Clarke. It is not possible for me to disasso-
ciate the two, and therefore I must write of both. Mr.
Clarke’s life naturally divides itself into two parts —his
New Zealand life, which came to an end when he was
23 years of age; and his subsequent ministerial life in
Hobart. Each life complete in itself and each life equally
memorable.
Mr. Clarke was born at Sydney, in 1823, where his
father and mother had arrived the previous year from
England, awaiting the opportunity of proceeding to New
Zealand, for in those far off days the opportunities were
few and far between. It was under the auspices of the


Rev. George Clarke
Church Missionary Society that Mr. Clarke’s father came
out from England to take up work among the Maoris on
the North Island. In the following year the family em-
barked in the French corvette, ‘La Coquine ,’ commanded by
D’Urville, the celebrated French navigator, for New Zea-
land and finally settled at the ‘Bay of Islands.’ At the age
of nine, young Clarke came to Hobart, where for four years
he went to school, returning to his family in New Zealand
in 1836. It was during the following years that young
George Clarke became acquainted with the Maori chiefs,
by whom he was fully trusted, and acquired such a thorough
knowledge of the Maori language that he secured a posi-
tion in the Civil Service and subsequently was appointed
Government Interpreter in all cases before the Courts,
It was during the period of the first lamentable Maori
War that young George Clarke became widely known and
rendered such valuable services. It has been the lot of few
young men to come to the front so early in life, and before
the age of 23 to ‘ make history.’ His successful struggle
with the New Zealand Company on behalf of the rights of
the Maoris, when he was but 21, was a splendid piece of
work, and showed how strenuously and fearlessly he could
fight on the side of justice and fair dealing, as opposed to
injustice and greed. Trusted alike by the Government
and the opposing Maori Chiefs, he was selected to conduct
the negotiations which resulted in a peaceful settlement of
the first Maori war; and, certainly, had his wise and con-
ciliatory counsels been followed, there never would have
been a second. These two instances are only samples
culled from Mr. Clarke’s book, Early Life in New Zealand, of
the great and good work that he accomplished to the
lasting benefit of both the Maoris and the settlers in New
Zealand ; and any one who makes himself acquainted with
the stirring story he has told, will certainly endorse what
has been freely said, that many a K.C.8., or a G.C.M.G., has
been conferred for national services far less deserving of
recognition than those of young George Clarke.


Rev* George Clarke
Finally, in 1846, at the age of 23, after serving in the
New Zealand Civil Service under three Governors, the last
Sir George Grey, Mr. Clarke resigned. He desired to carry
out an early purpose and prepare himself for the ministry,
and besides, his conscience could not approve the policy
of the Government towards the Maoris; holding it to be
neither straight-forward nor wise. In 1846, therefore, the
New Zealand stage of Mr. Clarke’s life closed.
From New Zealand, Mr. Clarke came to Hobart at the
invitation of his father’s old friend, Mr. Henry Hopkins, a
gentleman who was widely known as a liberal supporter of
Missions and Churches, and early in the following year,
1847, took passage in the barque Wellington, for London.
It was at this time that Mr. Clarke first crossed my path,
for I was an apprentice on board that vessel while he was
a cabin passenger. I well remember him as he walked the
poop, tall, wiry and tanned from the healthy out-door life
he had lived in New Zealand. We knew one another by
name, that was all, and his greeting when he saw me at the
wheel was a simple ‘ good morning ’ or ‘ good day.’ On
reaching London we parted, he to enter on his college
course at New College, preparatory to being ordained, and
I to complete my apprenticeship at sea.
In 1851, Mr. Clarke having completed his college
course, was duly ordained, and at once came out to Hobart,
where he accepted a call to the pastorate of the Collins
Street Congregational Church. In 1852 1 found my way
back to Hobart, and at the bedside of my dying father I
once again—after a parting of five years —met the Rev.
George Clarke, and there and then began the intimate and
life-long friendship which lasted for sixty years.
Residents in the old country can form no adequate
conception of the state of this Colony at that time, when
thousands of the adult male population were off to the gold
diggings, and Hobart was half depopulated. Reports in
the daily press of new rich finds, and the gold actually


Rev* 6eor<je Clarke
brought back by returned diggers, unsettled everybody. It
was just at such a time that the Rev. George Clarke entered
on his ministry and soon made his mark. Fresh from
college, with a well-stored mind and a youthful ardour
which carried all before it, he soon became a power in the
community; and more than this, young himself he attracted
the young, with the result that the old Church became
crowded out, so there was nothing for it but build a
larger one. This was in 1856, and in the following year
the new Church, built of stone and capable of seating
nearly 500, was opened. It was within the hallowed walls
of this Church that the ministry of the Rev. George Clarke
achieved its greatest triumphs.
How effective that ministry was, was evidenced by
the large congregations which filled the Church. But it
was not so much the numbers that testified to the ability
and power of the preacher and the mark he had made in
the community, as the attraction it proved to the more
thoughtful and earnest, especially to young men and
women. To them the preaching of Mr. Clarke most
strongly appealed ; and who that heard him can ever for-
get his New Year’s sermons to the young, so winning and
so wise; nor the privilege it was to attend his expository
Bible classes ? Many have been the occasions on which
Mr. Clarke has been selected to preach special sermons,
and never has he failed to justify such selection. Notably
was this the case when, at the request of the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of Science, he preached
before the members the annual sermon, taking for the sub-
ject of his discourse, ‘From Man to Nature, and From Man
to God.’ Men of light and leading —of all creeds and no
creed —from every part of Australasia were present on that
memorable occasion in Davey Street Church, and the un-
animous opinion was expressed that not another preacher
in the colonies could have handled his subject so well.
Nor have Mr. Clarke’s services been confined to the pulpit,
for many can remember his thoughtful addresses delivered


Rev* George Clarke
in the Town Hall at the annual meetings of the Council of
Education, and his public lectures on many subjects both
of public and literary interest. Mr. Clarke has greatly
served the cause of Education in Tasmania, and therefore
it was but fitting that those services should be recognised
by his selection to the honourable position of Chancellor of
the University of Tasmania.
As a fitting conclusion to what has been already said
of Mr. Clarke in reference to his valuable services in the
cause of education, I would here place on record what His
Excellency the Lieut.-Governor, Sir John Stokell Dodds,
K.C.M.G., as Chancellor of the University, said of him at
the Town Hall on Commemoration Day
‘I cannot close these remarks without reference to
the death of the Rev. George Clarke, a former Chan-
cellor of this University. I need not remind you of his
great attainments, his breadth of thought, his cultured
intellect, the simplicity and nobility of his character,
and his splendid work amongst us ; these are fresh in
your memory, and their great influence for good has
been deeply felt in this community. During a long
life of strenuous effort for the uplifting of the people
amongst whom he lived, he unassumingly and uncon-
sciously erected an enduring monument to his own
virtues. The value of his services to the cause of
education and to this University is indeed great, and
only those who try to follow in his footsteps, and
emulate his splendid example, can justly appreciate
the loss that we have sustained. In sadness we mourn
for him, but we rejoice to know that, crowned with the
majesty of years, he passed into the long silence, loved
and revered by those for whom he laboured.’
But I dearly love to speak of Mr. Clarke as the man I
found him —my guide, philosopher and friend. I have
known Mr. Clarke on many occasions and under diverse
circumstances, but the ‘ man ’ was always the same, I have


Rev* 6eor<je Clarke
listened to him when, on our holiday trips, he has gathered
about him a week-day congregation of bushmen and
settlers, and preached to them in the unclerical garb of a
typical bushman; and I have listened to him when, standing
in his own pulpit, clad in flowing and dignified robes, he
has riveted the attention of a crowded audience, and I dare
not say on which occasion he was the greater. We have
been companions on our holiday journeys around the east
of the Island and to the Lakes; we have been trips in barge
and fishing boat down the Channel, around Bruni, and
away on the East Coast as far as Maria Island, camping
ashore every night, and everywhere and always, though
one of us, we never forgot the reverence and respect due to
our beloved pastor. Mr. Clarke in those holiday trips, as
the result of his New Zealand experiences, proved himself
the most capable of bushmen. There was no fear of his
losing himself through the trackless bush, and besides, he
was an expert fisherman and could cook like a Maori.
Mr. Clarke has at all times been a welcome and an
honoured guest in my home, and gladdened old and young-
alike by his presence. It was Mr. Clarke who united us in
the indissoluble bonds of holy matrimony, and blessed our
union with the Divine benediction. It was Mr. Clarke who
standing at the open grave of my children, committed their
bodies to the silent tomb, in ‘ the sure and certain hope.’
It was Mr. Clarke who married my daughters and christened
their little ones. His love has doubled my joys, and his
brotherly sympathy has halved my sorrows. As my pastor
and teacher he has made plain to me the way in which I
should walk and has upheld me therein; he has opened to
me the Scriptures; he has given me glorious visions of ‘the
better land,’ and a ‘ hope ’ which has ever been growing
brighter and brighter.
With the following words, which I extract from the
notice in the press on the occasion of Mr. Clarke’s retire-


Rev* George Clarke
ment from the pastorate of Davey Street Church, I bring
this, my tribute to my beloved pastor, to a close.
‘And now in his eighty-first year, honoured by all
and greatly beloved by those who know him best, the
reverend Pastor of Davey Street Congregational Church
has resigned his office. What those fifty-two years of
public service have done for the community, who can
estimate ? What of the hundreds of young men and
women who have been brought under his influence, and
are now scattered throughout the length and breadth
of the Commonwealth, many of them filling positions
of great honour and trust ? It is not given to anyone to
see now the complete results of accomplished work ; but
seen or unseen, all faithful work abides and grows ;
and most assuredly 'the day’ will reveal all the results
of Mr. Clarke’s faithful ministry of fifty-two years.’
CHARLES E. WALCH
Hobart,
September, 1913.
Most impressive was the funeral service, in which the
pastor, Rev. E. Handel Jones, Revs. G. W. Sharp, and W.
L. Slack took part —as was also the In Memoriam Service
on the following Sunday,
The representative character of the audience, on both
occasions, testified, eloquently, to the high esteem in which
the veteran late pastor was held. Mr. Jones, in the course
of his sermon based on Acts xiii. 36, dwelt on the distin-
guished, and manifold, gifts of deceased, which qualified
him to fill, so well, many niches in the temple of citizenship.
His mature judgment, and keen sense of justice, so charac-


Rev* 6eorcje Clarke
teristic of Mr. Clarke, even when a young man, would have,
he remarked, distinguished him pre-eminently as a judge.
But it was as a preacher he excelled. His ministry
was eminently creative. His broad, cultured exegesis of
God’s word was measured only by his choice language,
silver diction, and the fine ethical tone, and spiritual vision,
which characterised it, A judge, from a sister State, an
ardent admirer of Mr. Clarke, made Hobart, frequently, his
holiday resort, mainly to avail himself of the privilege of
attending his ministry.
The preacher, however, in Mr. Clarke, was richly sus-
tained by the Christian gentleman that shone through all
his utterances, and social relations —happily linking all
classes together by a large hearted toleration —conceding
to one and all, the individual rights of conscience which he
claimed for himselt. A simple, natural demeanour, marked
him throughout.
‘And, as the greatest only are,
In his simplicity sublime.’
E. HANDEL JONES,
Pastor
