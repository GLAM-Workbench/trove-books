As foretold now many a day
Midnight scarce had passed away ;
Chrutvs natus hodie.
Very early, very early Christ was born.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell.
He was bora to set us free,
He was bora our Lord to be ;
Ex Maria Virgine.
The God, the Lord by all adored for ever,
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell.
Christian folk, rejoice and sing,
?Tis the birthday of a King ;
Hearts and voices to Him bring,
The God, the Lord by all adored for ever.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell.

Hark I a voice from yonder manger
Soft and sweet, doth entreat;
? Flee from woe and danger.
Brethren, come ; from all that grieves you
You are freed ; all you need
Here your Saviour gives you.?
Come, then, let us hasten yonder ;
Here let all, great and small,
Kneel in awe and wonder.
Love Him who with love is yearning ;
Hail the Star, that from far
Bright with hope is burning.

(For lour male voices).
Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurl?d ;
And still their heavenly music floats
O?er all the weary world :
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
Ami ever o?er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing,
O ye, beneath life?s crushing load
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow ;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing :
0 rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing.
For 10, the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.
The Basses may sing this line an octave lower.

A chosen few the secret knew ;
From the clouds they heard the story;
For an angel throng, in sweetest song,
Proclaimed the King of Glory.
The simple shepherds watching near
Sped to that place so lowly,
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
Where lay the Lord most holy.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell.
Come brethren all, both great and small,
And bless that heavenly Stranger
The mother maid so gently laid
To rest in a humble manger.
In spirit let us hasten to
That oxen stall so lowly,
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, Nowell,
Where lay the Lord most holy.
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell.

A stable and a manger, where
The oxen lowed around
Was all the room the inn could spare,
The welcome that they found.
Yet blessed among women was
That holy mother maid,
Who on that night her first-born Son
There in the manger laid.
Angels in heaven for us on earth
Their joyful anthems sing,
For unto us a Child is born,
Our Saviour and our King.
The angels? carol then sing we,
And forth God?s praises shew-
rail, ? To God on high all glory be,
Peace and good will below."
