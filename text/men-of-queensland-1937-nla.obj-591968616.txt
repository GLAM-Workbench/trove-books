MASSEY, HARRY,
Alderman, Brisbane City Council.
Private Address: Glen Road, Toowong.
Educated at Camberwell Grammar School, Melbourne, Victoria.
He represents the Toowong Ward. He was born in Melbourne
in 1888, and was educated at the Camberwell Grammar School. In his
early ’teens he entered the horticultural profession, and later acquired
a full knowledge of the soft goods business with some of Melbourne’s
largest houses. When he became twenty-one years old he commenced
business on his own account in Melbourne, and ten years ago came


to Queensland and opened in Brisbane as a clothing manufacturer,
where he conducts various fashion salons dealing exclusively in ladies’
wearing apparel.
Tn 1931, in which the Civic Reform League was formed, he was the
last minute choice as the aldermanic candidate for election as alder-
?J an ot Toowong Ward. In that election he was opposed by the Lord
Mayor, Alderman A. Watson, and one other opponent. Although this
seat m the Council was looked upon as safe for the then Lord Mayor
Alderman Massey defeated both opponents by some hundreds of votes!
Dining the ensuing three years Alderman Massey was the only
e LJ nan to honor his pledge of “No Pay to Aldermen,” and he served
the Toowong ratepayers without salary. At the last civic election he
by his pledge to “Eliminate Politics from Municipal
Affairs.”. He dissociated himself from his former colleagues when they
fused with the C.P.N. party, who fought the 1934 election as the
Nationalist Citizens’ Party. On that occasion he contested the Toowong
Waid as an Independent, and again defeated his two opponents by
over 1,200 votes.
In the last four years Alderman Massey has been a severe critic
on municipal finance. He has a close insight into the finances of the
various departments of the Council and public utilities of the citizens
and believes that every undertaking of the Brisbane City Council
should function on its own finances.
Aldei man Massey in his early days played first class cricket and
football; did a good deal of footrunning, and was a good amateur boxer.
At the age of twenty-one he was President of the Melbourne Branch of
the Australian Natives’ Association and was prominent in Y.M.C.A.
circles. His hobbies are boating and golf, and also looking after the
material interests of the civic electors of the ward of Toowong.
