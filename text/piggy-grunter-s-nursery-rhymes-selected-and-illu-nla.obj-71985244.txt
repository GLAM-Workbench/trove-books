Old King Cole was a merry old soul,
And a merry old soul was he
He called for his pipe, and he called
for his bowl.
And he called for his fiddlers three.

What shall we give him?
Brown bread and butter!
How shall he cut it without any knife?
How shall he marry
Without any wife?

Eating his Christmas Pie.
He put in his thumb and pulled out

SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE,
Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full
of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.
When the pie was opened the birds
began to sing
Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before
the King?

POCKET FULL OF RYE
The King was in his counting house, counting

The Queen was in the parlour, eating bread
and honey.
The Maid was in the garden, hanging
out the clothes.
When along came a blackbird
and pecked off her
nose.

The sheeps in the meadow, the cow's

Hes under the haystack, fast asleep!

Tapping at the window, crying through

"Are the boys and girls in bed? It's past
eight o clock!

Hickory, dickory, dock.
I HAD A LITTLE NUT TREE

bear
But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear
The King of Spain's daughter came to
visit me
And all for the sake of my little nut tree!

Sat on a tuffet
Eating her curds and whey
There came a big spider.
And sat down beside her.
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

"Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
How does your garden grow??
"Silver bells, and cockle shells,
And columbines all in a row."


GOOD NIGHT!
