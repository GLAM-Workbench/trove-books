The following is a brief report of this horrid
tragedy, which was brought to light on the trial
of 30 convicts, before the high court of justiciary
at Sydney, for the murder of a party of natives,
men, women 8t children, supposed to be upwards
of thirty in number. Twenty five were found
guilty and ordered for execution. The trial last-
ed two days, and the principal witness was one
of the party whose evidence detailed one of the
most remorseless and inhuman deeds recorded. It
appears that a party of the natives committed a
robbery on the premises of Mr. Wheatly, a large
farmer and sheep breeder, he sent five of his shep
herds (all convicts) accompanied by five of the
servants of Mr Maurice, with other servants of
farmers, (convicts) who had previously been rob-
bed by the natives j they were all provided with
horses. They started at day-break, at mid-day
they fell in with a party of natives, supposed to
be about thirty men, women and children, squat-
t�d tagether under a bush. The immediately
