?Shearing commences to-morrow!? These apparently simple words
were spoken by Hugh Gordon, the manager of Anabanco station, in the
district of Riverina, in the colony of New South Wales, one Monday
morning in the month of August. The utterance had its importance to
every member of a rather extensive ?corps dramatique ? awaiting the
industrial drama about to he performed.
A low sand-hill a few years since had looked out over a sea of grey
plains, covered partly with grass, partly with salsiferous bushes and
herbs. Two or three huts built of the trunks of the pine and roofed with
the bark of the box-tree, and a skeleton-looking cattle-yard with its high
?gallows? (a rude timber stage whereon to hang slaughtered cattle),
alone broke the monotony of the plain-ocean. A comparatively small herd
of cattle, 2,000 or 3,000, found more than sufficient pasturage during the
short winter and spring, but were always compelled to migrate to mountain
pastures, when the swamps, which alone in those days formed the water-
stores of the run, were dried up. But two or three, or at most half-a-
dozen, stockmen, were ever needed for the purpose of managing the herd,
so inadequate in number and profitable occupation to this vast tract of
grazing country.
But, a little later, one of the great chiefs of the wool-producing
interest ?a shepherd-king, so to speak, of shrewdness, energy, and
capital, ?had seen, approved and purchased the lease of this waste
kingdom. Almost at once, as if by magic, the scene changed. Great
gangs of navvies appeared wending their way across the silent plain.
Bams were made, wells were dug. Tons of fencing-wire were dropped on
the sand by the long line of teams which seemed never tired of arriving.
Sheep by thousands, and tens of thousands, began to come grazing and
cropping up to the lonely sandhill ?now swarming with blacksmiths,
carpenters, engineers, fencers, shepherds, bullock-drivers till the place
looked like a fair on the borders of Tartary.
Meanwhile everything was moving with calculated force and cost,
under the ? reign of law.? The seeming expense was merely the economic
truth of doing all the necessary work at once, rather than by instalments.
One hundred men for one day rather than one man for one hundred days.
Results soon began to demonstrate themselves. In twelve months the dams
were full, the wells sending up their far-fetched priceless water, the wire-
fences erected, the shepherds gone, and 17,000 sheep cropping the herbage
of Anabanco. Tuesday was the day fixed for the actual commencement
of the momentous, almost solemn transaction, ?the pastoral Hegira, so


to speak, as the time of most station events is calculated with reference
to it, as happening before or after shearing. But before the first shot is
fired which tells of the battle begun, what raids and skirmishes, what
reconnoitring and vidette duty must take place !
First arrives the cook-in-chief to the shearers, with two assistants, to
lay in a few provisions for the week?s consumption of seventy able-bodied
men. I must here explain that the cook of a large shearing-shed is a
highly paid and tolerably irresponsible official. Ho is paid and provided
by the shearers. Payment is generally arranged on the scale of half-a-
crown a head weekly from each shearer. For this sum he must provide
punctual and effective cooking, paying out of his own pocket as many
? marmitons ? as may be needful for that end, and to satisfy his tolerably
exacting and fastidious employers.
In the present case he confers with the storekeeper, Mr. de Yere; a
young gentleman of aristocratic connexions, who is thus gaining an
excellent practical knowledge of the working of a large station, ?and
to this end has the store-keeping department entrusted to him during
shearing.
He does not perhaps look quite fit for a croquet party as he stands
now, with a flour-scoop in one hand and a pound of tobacco in the other.
But he looks like a man at work, and also like a gentleman, as he is.
? Jack the Cook ? thus addresses him :
? Now, Mr. de Yere, I hope there?s not going to be any humbugging
about my rations and things ! The men are all up in their quarters, and
as hungry as free selectors. They?ve been a-payin? for their rations for
ever so long, and of course, now shearing?s on, they?re good for a
little extra! ?
? All right, Jack,? returns De Yere, good-tcmperedly; ? all your lot was
weighed out and sent away before breakfast. You must have missed the
cart. Here?s the list. I?ll read it out to you:?Three bags flour, half
a bullock, two bags sugar, a chest of tea, four dozen of pickles, four dozen
of jam, two gallons of vinegar, five lbs. pepper, a bag of salt, plates,
knives, forks, ovens, frying-pans, saucepans, iron pots, and about a
hundred other things. Now, mind you, return all the cooking things safe,
or pay for them ?that?s the order. You don?t want anything more, do
you ? You?ve got enough for a regiment of cavalry, I should think.?
? Well, I don?t know. There won?t be much left in a week if the
weather holds good,? makes answer the chief, as one who thought nothing
too stupendous to be accomplished by shearers ; ? but I knew I?d forgot
something. As I?m here I?ll take a few dozen boxes of sardines, and a case
of pickled salmon. The boys likes ?em, and, murder alive ! haven?t we
forgot the plums and currants; a hundredweight of each, Mr. de Yere.
They?ll be crying out for plum-duff and currant buns for the afternoon ;
and bullying the life out of me, if I haven?t a few trifles like. It?s a
hard life, surely, a cook. Well, good-by, sir, you have ?em all
down in the book.?


Lest the reader should imagine that the rule of Mr. Gordon at
Anabanco was a reign of luxury and that waste which tendeth to penury,
let him be aware that all shearers in Riverina are paid at a certain
rate, usually that of one pound per hundred sheep shorn. They agree,
on the other hand, to pay for all supplies consumed by them at certain
prices fixed before the shearing agreement is signed. Hence, it is entirely
their own affair whether their mess bills are extravagant or economical.
They can have anything within the rather wide range of the station store.
Fates de foie gras , ortolans, roast ostrich, novels, top-boots, double-
barrelled guns, if the;/ like to pay for them ?with one exception. No wine,
no spirits ! Neither are they permitted to bring these stimulants ?on to
the ground? for their private use. Grog at shearing? Matches in a
powder-mill! It?s very sad and bad; but our Anglo-Saxon industrial or
defensive champion cannot be trusted with the fire-water. Navvies, men-
of-war?s men, soldiers, and shearers, ?fine fellows all. But though the
younger men might only drink in moderation, the majority and the older
men are utterly without self-control once in the front of temptation. And
wars, ? wounds without cause,? hot heads, shaking hands, delay and bad
shearing, would be the inevitable results of spirits ?a la discretion." So
much is this a matter of certainty from experience, that a clause is inserted
and cheerfully signed, in most shearing agreements, ? that any man
getting drunk or bringing spirits on to the station during shearing, loses the
whole of the money earned by him.? The men know that the restriction
is for their benefit, as well as for the interest of the master, and join in
the prohibition heartily.
Let us give a glance at the small army of working-men assembled at
Anabanco, ?one out of hundreds of stations in the colony of New South
Wales, ranging from 100,000 sheep downwards. There are seventy
shearers; about fifty washers, including the men connected with the
steam-engine, boilers, bricklayers, &c.; ten or twelve boundary-riders,
whose duty it is to ride round the large paddocks, seeing that the fences
are all intact, and keeping a general look-out over the condition of the
sheep ; three or four overseers ; half-a-dozen young gentlemen acquiring
a practical knowledge of sheep-farming, or, as it is generally phrased,
?colonial experience,? a comprehensive expression enough; a score or
two of teamsters, with a couple of hundred horses or bullocks, waiting
for the high-piled wool-bales, which are loaded up and sent away almost
as soon as shorn; wool-sorters, pickers-up, pressers, yardsmen, extra
shepherds. It may easily be gathered from this outline, what an ? army
with banners ? is arrayed at Anabanco. While statistically inclined, it
may be added, that the cash due for the shearing alone (less the mess-bill)
amounts to 1,700/.; for the washing (roughly), 400/., exclusive of pro-
visions consumed, hutting, wood, water, cooking, &c. Carriage of wool
1,500/. Other hands from 30/. to 40/. per week. All of which disburse-
ments take place within from eight to twelve weeks after the shears are in
the first sheep.


Tuesday comes ? big with fate.? As the sun tinges the far sky-line,
the shearers are taking a slight refection of coffee and currant buns, to
enable them to withstand the exhausting interval between six and eight
o?clock, when the serious breakfast occurs. Shearers always diet them-
selves on the principle that the more they eat the stronger they must be.
Digestion, as preliminary to muscular development, is left to take its
chance. They certainly do get through a tremendous amount of work.
The whole frame is at its utmost tension, early and late. But the
preservation of health is due to their natural strength of constitution
rather than to their profuse and unscientific diet. Half-an-hour after
sunrise Mr. Gordon walks quietly into the vast building which contains
the sheep and their shearers?called ? the shed,? par excellence. Every-
thing is in perfect cleanliness and order. The floor swept and smooth,
with its carefully planed boards of pale yellow aromatic pine. Small
tramways, with baskets for the fleeces, run the wool up to the wool-tables,
superseding the more general plan of hand-picking. At each side of the
shed floor are certain small areas, four or five feet square, such space
being found by experience to be sufficient for the postures and gymnastics
practised during the shearing of a sheep. Opposite to each square is an
aperture, communicating with a long narrow paled yard, outside of the
shed. Through this each man pops his sheep when shorn, where he
remains in company with the others shorn by the same hand, until
counted out. This being done by the overseer or manager supplies a
check upon hasty or unskilful work. The body of the wool-shed, floored
with battens placed half an inch apart, is filled with the woolly victims.
This enclosure is subdivided into minor pens, of which each fronts the
place of two shearers, who catch from it until the pen is empty. When
this takes place, a man for the purpose refills it. As there are local
advantages, an equitable distribution of places has to be made by lot.
On every subdivision stands a shearer, as Mr. Gordon w T alks, with an
air of calm authority, down the long aisle. Seventy men, chiefly in their
prime, the flower of the working-men of the colony, they are variously
gathered. England, Ireland, and Scotland are represented in the propor-
tion of one half of the number ; the other half is composed of native-
born Australians.
Among these last?of pure Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Celtic descent?are
to be seen some of the finest men, physically considered, the race is
capable of producing. Taller than their British-born brethren, with softer
voices and more regular features, they inherit the powerful frames and
unequalled muscular development of the breed. Leading lives chiefly
devoted to agricultural labour, they enjoy larger intervals of leisure than
is permissible to the labouring-classes of Europe. The climate is mild,
and favourable to health. They have been accustomed, from childhood,
to abundance of the best food; opportunities of intercolonial travel are
frequent and common. Hence the Anglo-Australian labourer, without, on
the one hand, the sharpened eagerness which marks his Transatlantic


cousin, lias yet an air of independence and intelligence, combined with a
natural grace of movement, unknown to the peasantry of Britain.
An idea is prevalent that the Australians are, as a race, physically
inferior to the British. It is asserted that they grow too fast, tend to
height and slenderness, and do not possess adequate stamina and muscle.
The idea is erroneous. The men reared in the cities on the seaboard,
living sedentary lives in shops, banks, or counting-houses, are doubtless
more or less pale and slight of form. So are they who live under such
conditions all over the world. But those youngsters who have followed
the plough on the upland farms, or lived a wilder life on the stations of the
far interior, who have had their fill of wheaten bread and beefsteaks since
they could walk, and snuffed up the free bush breezes from infancy, they
are men ?
Stout of heart and ready of hand,
As e?er drove prey from Cumberland ;
?a business, I may remark, at which many of them would have distin-
guished themselves.
Take Abraham Lawson, as he stands there in a natural and unstudied
attitude, six feet four in his stockings, wide-chested, stalwart, with a face
like that of a Greek statue. Take Billy May, fair-haired, mild, insou-
ciant, almost languid, till you see him at work. Then, again, Jack
Windsor, handsome, saucy, and wiry as a bull-terrier?like him, with
strong natural inclination for the combat; good for any man of his weight,
or a trifle over, with the gloves or without.
It is curious to note how the old English practice of settling disputes
with nature?s weapons has taken root in Australia. It would ? gladden
the sullen souls ? of the defunct gladiators to w T atch two lads, whose
fathers had never trodden England?s soil, pull off their jackets, and go to
work ? hammer and tongs,? with all the savage silence of the true island
type.
It is now about seven o?clock. Mr, Gordon moves forward. As he
does so, every man loans towards the open door of the pen in front of
which he stands. The bell sounds ! With the first stroke each one of
the seventy men has sprung upon a sheep ; has drawn it out ?placed its
head across his knee, and is working his shears, as if the ? last man out ?
w r as to be flogged, or tarred and feathered at the least. Four minutes?
James Steadman, who learned last year, has shorn down one side of his
sheep ; Jack Holmes and Gundajai Bill are well down the other sides of
theirs ; when Billy May raises himself with a jerking sigh, and releases
his sheep, perfectly clean-shorn from the nose to the heels, through the
aperture of his separate enclosure. With the same effort apparently he
calls out ? Wool! ? and darts upon another sheep. Drawing this second
victim across his knee, he buries his shear-points in the long wool of its
neck. A moment after a lithe and eager boy has gathered up fleece
number one, and tossed it into the train-basket. He is half-way down
its side, the wool hanging in one fleece like a great glossy mat, before


you have done wondering whether he did really shear the first sheep, or
whether he had not a ready-shorn one in his coat-sleeve?like a conjuror.
By this time Jack Holmes and Gundajai Bill are ? out,? or finished;
and the cry of ? Wool! wool! ? seems to run continuously up and down the
long aisles of the shed, like a single note upon some rude instrument. Now
and then the ? refrain ? is varied by ? Tar ! ? being shouted instead, when
a piece of skin is snipped off as well as the wool. Great healing properties
are attributed to this extract in the shed. And if a shearer slice off' a piece
of flesh from his own person, as occasionally happens, he gravely anoints
it with the universal remedy, and considers that the onus then lies with
Providence, there being no more that man can do. Though little time is
lost, the men are by no means up to the speed which they will attain in a
few days, when in full practice and training. Their nerve, muscle, eye,
endurance, will be all at, so to speak, concert-pitch, and sheep after sheep
will be shorn with a precision and celerity even awful to the unpro-
fessional observer.
The unpastoral reader may be informed that speed and completeness
of denudation are the grand desiderata in shearing; the employer thinks
principally of the latter, the shearer principally of the former. To adjust
equitably the proportion is one of those incomplete aspirations which
torment humanity. Hence the contest ?old as human society?between
labour and capital.
This is the first day. According to old-established custom a kind of
truce obtains. It is before the battle, ?the ?salut,? when no hasty
word or too demonstrative action can be suffered by the canons of goo 1
taste. Bed Bill, Flash Jack, Jem the Scooper, and other roaring blades,
more famous for expedition than faithful manipulation, are shearing to-
day with a painstaking precision, as of men to whom character is
everything.
Mr. Gordon marches softly up and down, regarding the shearers with
a paternal and gratified expression, occasionally hinting at slight improve-
ments of style, or expressing unqualified approval as a sheep is turned
out shaven rather than shorn. All goes on well. Nothing is heard
but expressions of good-will and enthusiasm for the general welfare.
It is a triumph of the dignity of labour.
One o?clock. Mr. Gordon moved on to the bell and sounded it. At the
first stroke several men on their way to the pens stopped abruptly and began
to put on their coats. One fellow of an alert nature (Master Jack
Windsor) had just finished his sheep and was sharpening his shears, when
his eye caught Mr. Gordon?s form in proximity to the final bell. With
a bound, like a wild-cat, he reached the pen and drew out his sheep a
bare second before the first stroke, amidst the laughter and congratulations
of his comrades. Another man had his hand on the pen-gate at the
same instant, but by the Median law was compelled to return shccpless.
He was cheered, but ironically. Those whose sheep were in an un-
finished stage quietly completed them ; the others moving off to their


huts, where their board literally smoked with abundance. An hour passed.
The meal was concluded ; the smoke was over ; and the more careful
men were back in the shed sharpening their shears by two o?clock.
Punctually at that hour the bell repeated its summons da capo. The
warm afternoon gradually lengthened its shadows; the shears clicked
in tireless monotone; the pens filled and became empty. The wool-
presses yawned for the mountain of fleeces which filled the bins in front
of them, divided into various grades of excellence, and continuously dis-
gorged them, neatly and cubically packed and branded.
At six the bell brought the day?s work to a close. The sheep of each
man were counted in his presence, and noted down with scrupulous care,
the record being written out in full and hung up for public inspection in the
shed next day. This important ceremony over, master and men, manager,
labourers and supernumeraries, betook themselves to their separate abodes,
with such keen avoidance of delay, that in five minutes not a soul was
left in or near the great building lately so busy and populous, except the
boys who were sweeping up the floor. The silence of ages seems to fall
and settle upon it.
Next morning at a rather earlier hour every man is at his post.
Business is meant decidedly. Now commences the delicate and difficult
part of the superintendence which keeps Mr. Gordon at his post in the
shed, nearly from daylight till dark, for from eight to ten weeks. During
the first day he has formed a sort of gauge of each man s temper and
workmanship. For now, and henceforth, the natural bias of each
shearer will appear. Some try to shear too fast, and in their haste sheai
badly. Some are rough and savage with the sheep, which do occasionally
kick and become unquiet at critical times; and it must be confessed are
provoking enough. Some shear very fairly and handsomely to a super-
ficial eye, but commit the unpardonable offence of ?leaving wool on.
Some are deceitful, shearing carefully when overlooked, but ? racing
and otherwise misbehaving directly the eye of authority is diverted. These
and many other tricks and defects require to be noted and abated, quietly
but firmly, by the manager of the shed,?firmly because evil would
develop and spread ruinously if not checked; quietly, because immense
loss might be incurred by a strike. Shearing differs from other work in
this wise: it is work against time, more especially in Riverina. If the
wool be not off the backs of the sheep before November, all sorts of
drawbacks and destructions supervene. The spear-shaped grass-seeds,
specially formed as if in special collusion with the Evil One, hasten to
bury themselves in the wool, and even in the flesh of the tender victims.
Dust rises in red clouds from the unmoistened, betrampled meadows
so lately verdurous and flower-spangled. From snowy white to an
unlovely ?bistre? turn the carefully washed fleeces, causing anathema
from overseers and depreciation from brokers. All these losses of tempei,
trouble, and money, become inevitable if shearing be protracted, it may
he, beyond a given week.


Hence, as in harvest with a short allowance of fair weather, discipline
must be tempered with diplomacy. Lose your temper, and be over
particular : off go Billy May, Abraham Lawson, and half-a-dozen of your
best men, making a weekly difference of perhaps two or three thousand
sheep for the remainder of the shearing. Can you not replace them ?
Not so ! Every shed in Riverina will be hard at work during this present
month of September and for every hour of October. Till that time not a
shearer will come to your gate; except, perhaps, one or two useless,
characterless men. Are you to tolerate bad workmanship ? Not that
either. But try all other means with your men before you resort to
harshness ; and be quite certain that your sentence is just, and that you
can afford the defection.
So our friend Mr. Gordon, wise from many tens of thousands of shorn
sheep that have been counted out past his steady eye, criticizes temperately,
but watchfully. He reproves sufficiently, and no more, any glaring fault;
makes his calculation as to who are really bad shearers, and can be dis-
charged without loss to the commonwealth, or who can shear fairly and
can be coached up to a decent average. One division, slow 7 , and good
only when slow, have to be watched lest they emulate ?the talent,? and
so come to grief. Then ? the talent ? has to be mildly admonished from
time to time lest they force the pace, set a bad example, and lure the
other men on to ? racing.? This last leads to slovenly shearing, ill-usage
of the sheep, and general dissatisfaction.
Tact, temper, patience, and firmness are each and all necessary in that
Captain of Industry, who has the very delicate and important task of
superintending a large wool-shed. Hugh Gordon had shown all in such
proportion as would have made him a distinguished man anywhere, had
fortune not adjusted for him this particular profession. Calm with the
consciousness of strength, he was kind and considerate in manner as in
nature, until provoked by glaring dishonesty or incivility. Then the lion
part of his nature woke up, so that it commonly went ill with the
aggressor. As this was matter of public report, he had little occasion to
spoil the repose of his bearing. Day succeeds day, and for a fortnight
the machinery goes on smoothly and successfully. The sheep arrive at an
appointed day and hour by detachments and regiments at the wash-pen.
They depart thence, like good boys on Saturday night, redolent of soap
and water, and clean to a fault; ?entering the shed white and flossy as
newly-combed poodles, to emerge, on the way back to their pasturage,
slim, delicate, agile, with a bright black A legibly branded wdth tar on
their paper-white skins.
The Anabanco world ?stiffish but undaunted?is turning out of bed
one morning. Ha ! what sounds are these ? and why does the room look
so dark ? Rain, as I?m alive. ? Hurrah ! ? says Master Jack Bowles, one
of the young gentlemen. He is learning (more or less) practical sheep-
farming, preparatory to having (one of these days) an Anabanco of his
own. ? Well, this is a change, and I?m not sorry for one,? quoth


Mr. Jack. ? I?m stiff all over. No one can stand such work long.
Won?t the shearers growl ? No shearing to-day, and perhaps none to-
morrow either.? Truth to tell, Mr. Bowles? sentiments are not confined to
his ingenuous bosom. Some of the shearers grumble at being stopped
?just as a man was earning a few shillings.? Those who are in top pace
and condition don?t like it. But to many of the rank and file?working
up to and a little beyond their strength?with whom swelled wrists and
other protests of nature are becoming apparent, it is a relief, and they are
glad of the respite. So at dinner-time all the sheep in the sheds, put in
overnight in anticipation of such a contingency, are reported shorn. All
hands are then idle for the rest of the day. The shearers dress and
avail themselves of various resources. Some go to look at their horses,
now in clover, or its equivalent, in the Riverina graminetum. Some play
cards, others wash or mend their clothes. A large px?oportion of the
Australians having armed themselves with paper, envelopes, and a
shilling?s-worth of stamps from the store, bethink themselves of neglected
or desirable correspondents. Many a letter for Mrs. Leftalone, Wallaroo
Creek, or Miss Jane Sweetapple, Honeysuckle Flat, as the case may be,
will find its way into the post-bag to-morrow. A pair of the youngsters
are having a round or two with the gloves; while to complete the variety
of recreations compatible with life at a wool-shed, a selected troupe are
busy in the comparative solitude of that building, at a rehearsal of a
tragedy and a farce, with which they intend, the very next rainy day, to
astonish the population of Anabanco.
At the home-station a truce to labour?s ? alarms ? is proclaimed
except in the case and person of Mr. de Yere. So far is he from par-
ticipation in the general holiday, that he finds the store thronged with
shearers, washers, and ? knock-about men,? who being let loose, think it
would be nice to go and buy something ?pour passer le temps.? He
therefore grumbles slightly at having no rest like other people.
? That?s all very fine,? says Mr. Jack Bowles, who, seated on a case, is
smoking a large meerschaum and mildly regarding all things ; ? but what
have you got to do when we?re all hard at work at the shed ? ? with an
air of great importance and responsibility.
? That?s right, Mr. Bowles,? chimes in one of the shearers ; ? stand up
for the shed. I never see a young gentleman work as hard as you do.?
? Bosh ! ? growls De Yere ; ? as if anybody couldn?t gallop about from
the shed to the wash-pen, and carry messages, and give half of them wrong !
Why, Mr. Gordon said the other day, he should have to take you oft' and
put on a Chinaman, ?that he couldn?t make more mistakes.?
? All envy and malice, and t?other thing, De Yere, because you
think I?m rising in the profession,? returns the good-natured Bowles.
? Mr. Gordon?s going to send 20,000 sheep, after shearing, to the Lik Lak
paddock, and he said I should go in charge.?
? Charge be hanged ! ? laughs De Yere (with two very bright-patterned
Crimean shirts, one in each hand, which he offers to a tall young shearer


for inspection). ? There?s a well there, and whenever either of the two men,
of whom you?ll have charge, gets sick or runs away, you?ll have to work
the whim in his place, till another man?s sent out, if it?s a month.?
This appalling view of station promotion rather startles Mr. Jack, who
applies himself to his meerschaum, amid the ironical comments of the
shearers. However, not easily daunted or ? shut up,? according to the
more familiar station phrase, he rejoins, after a brief interval of contem-
plation, ?that accidents will happen, you know, De Yere, my boy?
apropos of which moral sentiment, I?ll come and help you in your dry-
goods business; and then, look here, if yon get ill or run away, I?ll have
a profession to fall back upon.? This is held to be a Roland of sufficient
pungency for De Yere?s Oliver. Every one laughed. And then the two
youngsters betook themselves to a humorous puffing of the miscellaneous
contents of the store: tulip-beds of gorgeous Crimean shirts, boots,
books, tobacco, canvas-slippers, pocket-knives, Epsom salts, pipes,
pickles, painkillers, pocket-handkerchiefs and pills, sardines, saddles,
shears and sauces; in fact everything which every kind of man might
want, and which apparently every man did want, for large and various
were the purchases, and great the flow of conversation. Finally, every-
thing was severely and accurately debited to the purchasers, and the store
was cleared and locked up. A large store is a necessity of a large station;
not by any means because of the profit upon goods sold, but it obviously
would be bad economy for old Bill, the shepherd, or Barney, the bullock-
driver, to visit the next township, from ten to thirty miles distant, as the
case may be, every time the farmer wanted a pound of tobacco, or the
latter a pair of boots. They might possibly obtain these necessary
articles as good in quality, as cheap in price. But th�re are wolves in
that wood, oh, my w r eak brothers! In all towns dwells one of the ? sons
of the Giant ? ?the Giant Grog?red-eyed, with steel muscles and iron
claws; once in these, which have held many and better men to the
death, Barney nor Bill emerges, save pale, fevered, nerveless, and im-
pecunious. So arose the station store. Barney befits himself with
boots without losing his feet; Bill fills his pocket with match-boxes
and smokes the pipe of sobriety, virtuous perforce till his carnival, after
shearing.
The next day was wet, and threatened further broken weather.
Matters were not too placid with the shearers. A day or two for rest
is very well, but continuous wet weather means compulsory idleness,
and gloom succeeds repose ; for not only are all hands losing time and
earning no money, but they are, to use the language of the stable,
? eating their heads off? the while. The rather profuse mess and general
expenditure, which caused little reflection when they were earning at the
rate of two or three hundred a year, became unpleasantly suggestive, now
that all is going out and nothing coming in. Hence loud and deep were
the anathemas as the discontented men gazed sadly or wrathfully at the
misty sky.

A few days? showery weather t having, therefore, well uigh driven our
shearers to desperation, out comes the sun in all his glory. He is never
far away or very faint in Riverina. All the pens are filled for the morrow ;
very soon after the earliest sunbeams the bell sounds its welcome sum-
mons, and the whole force tackles to the work with an ardour proportioned
to the delay, every man working as if for the ransom of his whole family
from slavery. How men work spurred on by the double excitement of
acquiring social reputatiomand making money rapidly ! Not an instant
is lost; not a nerve, limb, or muscle doing less than the hardest task-
master could flog out of a slave. Occasionally you see a shearer, after
finishing his sheep, walk quickly out, and not appearing for a couple of
hours, or perhaps not again during the day. Do not put him down as a
sluggard; be assured that he has tasked nature dangerously hard, and
has only given in just before she does. Look at that silent slight
youngster, with a bandage round his swollen wrist. Every ? blow ? of
the shears is agony to him, yet he disdains to give in, and has been
working ?in distress? for hours. The pain is great, as you can
see by the flush which occasionally surges across his brown face, yet
he goes on manfully to the last sheep, and endures to the very verge of
fainting.
There was now a change in the manner and tone of the shed, especially
towards the end of the day. It was now the ding of the desperate fray,
when the blood of the fierce animal man is up, when mortal blows are
exchanged, and curses float upward with the smoke and dust. The
ceaseless clicking of the shears ?the stern earnestness of the men, toiling
with a feverish and tireless energy?the constant succession of sheep
shorn and let go, caught and commenced ?the occasional savage oath
or passionate gesture, as a sheep kicked and struggled with perverse
delaying obstinacy?the cuts and stabs, with attendant effusion of blood,
both of sheep and shearers ?the brief decided tones of Mr. Gordon, in
repression or command ?all told the spectator that tragic action was
introduced into the performance. Indeed, one of the minor excitements
of shearing was then and there transacted. Mr. Gordon had more than
once warned a dark sullen-looking man that he did not approve of his
style of shearing. He was temporarily absent, and on his return
found the same man about to let go a sheep, whose appearance, as a
shorn wool-bearing quadruped, was painful and discreditable in the
extreme.
? Let your sheep go, my man,? said he, in a tone which somehow
arrested the attention of nearly all the shearers ; ? but don?t trouble your-
self to catch another ! ? ?
? Why not ? said the delinquent, sulkily.
? You know very well why not! ? replied Gordon, walking closely up
to him, and looking straight at him with eyes that began to glitter.
?You?ve had'fair warning; you?ve not chosen to take it. Now you
can go ! ?


? I suppose you?ll pay a man for the sheep he?s shorn ? ? growled out
the ruffian.
? Not one shilling until after shearing. You can come then if you
like,? answered Mr. Gordon, with perfect distinctness.
The cowed bully looked savagely at him ; but the tall powerful frame
and steady eye were not inviting for personal arbitration of the matter in
hand. He put up his two pairs of shears, put on his coat, and walked
out of the shed. The time was passed when Red Bill or Terrible Dick
(ruffians whom a sparse labour-market rendered necessary evils) would
have flung down his shears upon the floor and told the manager that if
he didn?t like that shearing he could shear his sheep himself and be
hanged to him ; or, on refusal of instant payment, would have proposed
to bury his shears in the intestines of his employer by way of adjusting
the balance between Capital and Labour. Many wild tales are told of
wool-shed rows. I knew of one squatter stabbed mortally with that fatal
and convenient weapon, a shear-blade.
The man thus. summarily dealt with could, like most of his com-
panions, shear very well if he took pains. Keeping to a moderate number
of sheep, his workmanship could be good. But he must needs try and
keep up with Billy May or Abraham Lawson, who can shear from 100 to
180 sheep per day, and do them beautifully. So in ?racing? he works
hastily and badly, cuts the skin of his luckless sheep nearly as often as
the wool, and leaves wool hero and there on them, grievous and exas-
perating to behold. So sentence of expulsion goes forth fully against him.
Having arrayed himself for the road he makes one more effort for a settle-
ment and some money wherewith to pay for board and lodging on the road.
Only to have a mad carouse at the nearest township, however; after
which he will tell a plausible story of his leaving the shed on account
of Mr. Gordon?s temper, and avail himself of the usual free hospitality
of the bush to reach another shed. He addresses Mr. Gordon with an
attempt at conciliation and deference.
? It seems very ?ard, sir, as a man can?t get the trifle of money coming
to him, which I?ve worked ?ard for.?
? It?s very hard you won?t try and shear decently,? retorts Mr. Gordon
by no means conciliated. ? Leave the shed ! ?
111-conditioned rascal as he is, he has a mate or travelling-companion
in whose breast exists some rough idea of fidelity. He now takes up
the dialogue.
? I suppose if Jim?s shearing don?t suit, mine won?t either,?
? I did not speak to you,.? answered Mr. Gordon, as calmly as if he
had expected the speech ; ? but of course you can go too.? He said this
with an air of studied unconcern, as if he would rather like a dozen more
men to knock off work. The two men walk out; but the epidemic does
not spread ; and several take the lesson home and mend their ways
accordingly.
The weather now was splendid ; not a cloud specked the bright blue


sky. The shearers continue to work at the same express-train pace ;
fifty bales of wool roll every day from the wool-presses ; as fast as they
reach that number they are loaded upon the numerous drays and
waggons which have been waiting 1 for weeks. Tall brown men have been
recklessly cutting up hides for the last fortnight, wherewith to lash the bales
securely." It is considered safer practice to load wool as soon as may be ;
fifty bales represent about a thousand pounds sterling. In a building,
however secure, should a fire break out, a few hundred bales are easily
burned; but once on the dray, this much-dreaded ? edax rerum? in a
dry country has little chance. The driver, responsible to the extent of
his freight, generally sleeps under his dray ; hence both watchman and
insulation are provided.
The unrelaxing energy with which the work was pushed at this stage
was exciting and contagious; at or before daylight every soul in the great
establishment was up. The boundary-riders were always starting off tor
a twenty or thirty mile ride, and bringing tens of thousands of sheep to
the wash-pen ; at that huge lavatory there was splashing and soaking all
day with an army of washers ; not a moment is lost from daylight till
dark, or used for any purpose save the all-engrossing work and needful
food. At nine o?clock p.m. luxurious dreamless sleep, given only to
those whose physical powers have been taxed to the utmost and who can
bear without injury the daily tension.
Everything and everybody were in splendid working order,? nothing
out of gear. Rapid and regular as a steam-engine the great host of toilers
moved onward daily with a march which promised an unusually early
completion. Mr. Gordon was not in high spirits,?for so cautious and
far-seeing a captain rarely felt himself so independent of circumstances as
to indulge in that reckless mood?but much satisfied with the prospect.
Whew ! the afternoon darkens, and the night is delivered over to water-
spouts and hurricanes, as it appears. Next day raw, gusty, with chili
heavy showers, drains to be cut, roofs to be seen to, shorn sheep shivering,
washers all playing pitch-and-toss, shearers sulky; everybody but the young
gentlemen wearing a most injured expression of countenance. ? Looks as
if it would rain for a month,? says Long Jack. ?If we hadn?t been
delayed might have had the shearing over by this.? Reminded that there
are 50 000 sheep yet remaining to be shorn, and that by no possibility
could they have been finished. Answers, ?he supposes so, always the
same, everything sure to go agin the poor man.? The weather did
not clear up. Winter seemed to have taken thought, and determined
to show even this land of eternal summer that he had his rights. The
shed would be filled, and before the sheep so kept dry were shorn,
down would come the rain again. Not a full day?s shearing for ten days.
Then the clouds disappeared as if the curtain of a stage had been rolled
up, and lo! the golden sun fervid and impatient to obliterate the track
� f TbeTrst day after the recommencement, matters went much as usual.


Steady work and little talk, as if every one was anxious to make up for
the lost time. But on the second morning after breakfast, when the bell
sounded, instead of the usual cheerful dash at the sheep, every man stood
silent and motionless in his place. Some one uttered the words ? roll
up ! ? Then the seventy men converged, and slowly, hut with one impulse,
walked up to the end of the shed where stood Mr. Gordon.
The concerted action of any body of men bears with it an element of
power which commands respect. The weapon of force is theirs, it is at their
option to wield it with or without mercy. At one period of Australian
colonization a superintendent in Mr. Gordon?s position might have had
good ground for uneasiness. Mr. Jack Bowles saw in it an ? emeute ?of
a democratic and sanguinary nature, regretted deeply his absent revolver,
but drew up to his leader prepared to die by his side. That calm cen-
turion felt no such serious misgivings. He knew that there had been dire
grumbling among the shearers in consequence of the weather. He knew
that there were malcontents among them. He was prepared for some sort of
demand on their part, and had concluded to make certain concessions of a
moderate degree. So looking cheerfully at the men, he quietly awaited
the deputation. As they neared him there was a little hesitation, and
then three delegates came to the front. These were Old Ben, Abraham
Lawson, and Billy May. Ben Thornton had been selected from his age
and long experience of the rights and laws of the craft. He was a weather-
beaten, wiry old Englishman, whose face and accent, darkened as the
former was by the Australian summers of half a century, still retained the
trace of his native Devonshire. It was his boast that he had shorn for
forty years, and as regularly ? knocked-down ? (or spent in a single
debauch) his shearing-money. Lawson represented the small free-
holders, being a steady, shrewd fellow, and one of the fastest shearers.
Billy May stood for the fashion and ?talent,? being the ?Ringer,? or
fastest shearer of the whole assembly, and as such truly admirable and
distinguished.
?Well now, men,? quoth Mr. Gordon, cheerily meeting matters half-
way, ?what?s it all about ? ? The younger delegate looked at old Ben,
who, now that it ? was demanded of him to speak the truth,? or such
dilution thereof as might seem most favourable to the interests of the
shed, found a difficulty like many wiser men about his exordium.
? Well, Muster Gordon,? at length he broke forth, ? look?ee here,
sir. The weather?s been awful bad, and clean agin shearing. We?ve
not been earning our grub, and ?
?So it has,? answered the manager, ?so it has ; but can I help the
weather ? I?m as anxious as you are to have the shearing over quickly.
We?re both of one mind about that, eh ? ?
? That?s all right enough, sir,? struck in Abraham Lawson ; who felt
that Ben was getting the worst of the argument, and was moreover far less
fluent than usual, probably from being deprived of the aid of the customary
expletives: ?but we?re come to say this, sir: that the season?s turned out


very wet indeed; we?ve had a deal of broken time, and the men feel it
very hard to be paying for a lot of rations, and hardly earning anything.
We?re shearing the sheep very close and clean. You won?t have ?em done
no otherways. Not like some sheds where a man can ? run ? a hit and
make up for lost time. Now we?ve all come to think this, sir, that if
we?re to go on shearing the sheep well, and to stick to them, and get them
done before the dust and grass-seed come in, that you ought to make us
some allowance. We know we?ve agreed for so much a hundred, and all
that. Still as the season?s turned so out-and-out had, we hope you?ll
consider it and make it up to us somehow.?
?Never knew a worse year,? corroborated Billy May, who thought it
indispensable to say something; ?haven?t made enough, myself, to pay
the cook.?
This was not strictly true, at any rate, as to Master Billy?s own
earnings; he being such a remarkably fast shearer (and good withal),
that he had always a respectable sum credited to him for his day?s work,
even when many of the slower men came off short enough.
However, enough had been said to make Mr. Gordon fully comprehend
the case. The men were dissatisfied. They had come in a roundabout
way to the conclusion that some pecuniary concession, not mentioned in
their bond, should come from the side of capital to that of labour.
Whether wages, interest of capital, share of profits, reserve fund, they
knew not nor cared. This was their stand. And being Englishmen they
intended to abide by it.
The manager had considered the situation before it actually arose.
He now rapidly took in the remaining points of debate. The shearers
had signed a specific agreement for a stipulated rate of payment,
irrespective of the weather. By the letter of the law, they had no case.
Whether they made little or much profit, was not his affair. But he was
a just and kindly man, as well as reasonably politic. They had shorn
well, and the weather had been discouraging. He knew too, that an
abrupt denial might cause a passive mutiny, if not a strike. If they
set themselves to thwart him, it was in their power to shear badly, to
shear slowly, and to force him to discharge many of them. He might
have them fined, perhaps imprisoned by the police-court. Mean-
while how could shearing go on ? Dust and grass-seeds would soon
be upon them. He resolved on a compromise, and spoke out at once
in a firm and decided tone as the men gathered up yet more closely
around him.
? Look here, all of you; you know very well that I?m not bound to
find you in fine weather. Still lam aware that the season has been
against you; you have shorn pretty >vell, so far, though I?ve had to make
examples, and am quite ready to make more. What lam willing to do,
is this : to every man who works on till the finish and shears to my
satisfaction, I will make a fair allowance in the ration account. That
is, I will make no charge for the beef. Does that suit you ? ? There


was a chorus of ? All right sir, we?re satisfied.? ? Mr. Gordon always
does the fair thing,? &c. And work was immediately resumed with
alacrity.
The clerk of the weather, too gracious even in these regions as far as
the absence of rain is concerned, was steadily propitious. Cloudless skies
and a gradually ascending thermometer alone were the signs that spring
was changing into summer. The splendid herbage ripened and dried;
patches of bare earth began to he discernible amid the late thick-swarded
pastures, dust to rise and cloud-pillars of sand to float and eddy, the
desert genii of the Arab. But the work went on at a high rate of speed,
outpacing the fast-coming summer; and before any serious disasters
arose, the last flock*was ?on the battens,? and, amid ironical'con-
gratulations, the ? cobbler,? or last sheep was seized, and stripped of his
rather dense and difficult fleece. In ten minutes the vast wool-shed,
lately echoing with the ceaseless click of the shears, the jests, the songs,
the oaths of the rude congregation, was silent and deserted. The floors
were swept, the pens closed, the sheep on their w T ay to a distant paddock.
Not a soul remains about the building but the pressers, who stay to work
at the rapidly lessening piles of fleeces in the bins, or a meditative
teamster who sits musing on a wool-bale, absorbed in a calculation as to
when his load will be made up.
It is sundown, a rather later time of closing than usual, but rendered
necessary by the possibility of the ? grand finale.? The younger men
troop over to the hut, larking like schoolboys. Abraham Lawson throws
a poncho over his broad shoulders, lights his pipe, and strides along,
towering above the rest, erect and stately as a guardsman. Considerably
more so than you or I, reader, would have been, had we shorn 180 sheep,
as he has done to-day. Billy May has shorn 142, and he puts his hand
on the five-feet paling fence of the yard and vaults over it like a deer,
preparatory to a swim in the creek. At dinner you will see them all
with fresh Crimeans and Jerseys, clean, comfortable, and in grand
spirits. Next morning is settling-day. The book-keeping department at
Anabanco being severely correct, all is in readiness. Each man?s tally or
number of sheep shorn has been entered daily to his credit. His private
and personal investments at the store have been as duly debited. The
shearers, as a corporation, have been charged with the multifarious
items of their rather copious mess-bill. This sum total is divided by the
number of the shearers, the extract being the amount for which each man
is liable. This sum varies in its weekly proportion at different sheds.
With an extravagant cook, or cooks, the weekly bill is often alarming.
When the men and their functionary study economy it may be kept
very reasonably low.
The men have been sitting or standing about the office for half-an-hour
when Mr. Jack Bowles rushes out, and shouts ? William May.? That
young person, excessively clean, attired in a quiet tweed suit, with his hair
cut very correctly short, advances with an air of calm intrepidity, and


faces Mr. Gordon, now seated at a long table, wearing a judicial expres-
sion of countenance.
? Well, May! here?s your account:?
So many sheep, at �1 per 100 �
Cook, so many weeks �
Shearing store account �
Private store account �
Total
?Is the tally of your sheep right ? Oh ! I daresay it?s all right,
Mr. Gordon. I made it so and so ; about ten less.?
?Well, well! ours is correct, no doubt. want to make up a
good subscription for the hospital this year. How much will you give ?
you?ve done pretty well, I think.?
? Put me down a pound, sir.
?Very well, that?s fair enough; if every one gives what they can
afford, you men will always have a place to go to when you?re hurt or laid
up. So I put your name down, and you?ll see it in the published list.
Now about the shearing, May. I consider that you?ve done your work
very well, and behaved very well all through. You?re a fast shearer, but
you shear closely, and don?t knock your sheep about. I therefore do not
charge you for any part of your meat-bill, and I pay you at the rate of half-
a-crown a hundred for all your sheep, over and above your agreement. Will
that do ? ?
? Very well, indeed, and I?m much obliged to you, Mr. Gordon.?
?Well, good-by, May! always call when you?re passing, and if any
work is going on you?ll get your share. Here?s your cheque. Send in
Lawson.? Exit May, in high spirits, having cleared about three pounds
per week, during the whole term of shearing, and having lived a far from
unpleasant life, indeed akin to that of a fighting cock, from the commence-
ment to the end of that period.
Lawson?s interview may be described as having very similar results.
He, also, was a first-class shearer, though not so artistic as the gifted
Billy. Jack Windsor?s saucy blue eyes twinkled merrily as he returned
to his companions, and incontinently leaped on the back of his wild eyed
colt. After these three worthies came a shearer named Jacks ; he belonged
to quite a different class; he could shear very well if he pleased, but had
a rooted disbelief that honesty was the best policy, and a fixed determina-
tion to shear as many sheep as he could get the manager to pass. By
dint of close watching, constant reprimand, and occasional ?raddling?
(marking badly-shorn sheep and refusing to count them), Mr. Gordon had
managed to tone him down to average respectability of execution ; still
he was always uneasily aware that whenever his eye was not upon him,
Jackson was doing what he ought not to do with might and main. He
had, indeed, kept him on from sheer necessity, but he intended none the
less to mark his opinion of him.


? Come in, Jackson ! your tally is so-and-so. Is that right ? ?
Jackson.?? I suppose so.?
? Cook and store account, so much ; shearing account so much.
Jackson.?? And a good deal too.?
? That is your affair,? said Mr. Gordon, sternly enough. ? Now look
here : you?re in my opinion a bad shearer and a bad man. You have
given me a great deal of trouble, and I should have kicked you out of the
shed weeks ago, if I had not been short of men; I shall make a differ-
ence between you and men who have tried to do their best; I make you
no allowance of any sort; I pay you by the strict agreement; there?s
your cheque. Go ! ?
Jackson goes out with a very black countenance. He mutters with
a surly oath that if ? he?d known how he was going to be served he?d
ha? ?blocked? ?em a little more.? He is pretty well believed to have
been served right, and he secures no sympathy whatever. Working-
men of all classes are shrewd and fair judges generally. If an employer
does his best to mete out justice he is always appreciated and supported
by the majority. These few instances will serve as a description of the
whole process of settling with the shearers. The horses have all been
got in. Great catching and saddling-up has taken place all the morning.
By the afternoon the whole party are dispersed to the four winds : some,
like Abraham Lawson and his friends, to sheds ? higher up,? in a colder
climate, where shearing necessarily commences later. From these they
will pass to others, until the last sheep in the mountain runs are shorn.
Then those who have not farms of their own betake themselves to reaping.
Billy May and Jack Windsor are quite as ready to back themselves against
time in the wdaeat-field as on the shearing-floor. Harvest over, they find
their pockets inconveniently full, so they commence to visit their friends
and repay themselves for their toils by a tolerably liberal allowance of rest
and recreation.
Old Ben and a few choice specimens of the olden time get no further
then the nearest public-house. Their cheques are handed to the landlord
and a ? stupendous and terrible spree ? sets in. At the end of a week
he informs them that they have received liquor to the amount of their
cheques ?something over a hundred pounds?save the mark ! They
meekly acquiesce, as is their custom. The landlord generously presents
them with a glass of grog each, and they take the road for the next wool-
shed.
The shearers being despatched, the sheep-w r ashers, a smaller and less
regarded force, file up. They number some forty men. Nothing more
than fair bodily strength, willingness and obedience being required in their
case, they are more easy to get and to replace than shearers. They
are a varied and motley lot. That powerful and rather handsome man
is a New Yorker, of Irish parentage. Next to him is a slight, neat, quiet
individual. He was a lieutenant in a line regiment. The lad in the rear
was a Sandhurst cadet. Then came tw r o navvies and a New Zealander, five


Chinamen, a Frenchman, two Germans, Tin Pot, Jerry, and Wallaby??
three aboriginal blacks. There are no invidious distinctions as to caste,
colour, or nationality. Every one is a man and a brother at sheep-
washing. Wage, one pound per week; wood, water, tents, and food
?a la discretion.? Their accounts are simple: so many weeks, so many
pounds ; store account, so much ; hospital ? well, five shillings ; cheque,
good-morning.
The wool-pressers, the fleece-rollers, the fleece-pickers, the yardsmen,
the washers? cooks, the hut cooks, the spare shepherds; all these and a
few other supernumeraries inevitable at shearing-time, having been paid off,
the snow-storm of cheques which has been fluttering all day comes to an
end. Mr. Gordon and the remaining ? sous-officiers ? go to rest that
night with much of the mental strain removed which has been telling on
every waking moment for the last two months.
The long train of drays and waggons, with loads varying from twenty
to forty-five bales, has been moving off in detachments since the com-
mencement. In a day or two the last of them will have rolled heavily
away. The 1,400 bales, averaging three and a half hundredweight, are
distributed, slow journeying, along the road, which they mark from afar,
standing huge and columnar like guide tumuli, from Anabanco to the
waters of the Murray. Between the two points there is neither a hill nor
a stone. All is the vast monotonous sea of plain?at this season a
prairie-meadow exuberant of vegetation; in the late summer, or in the
occasional and dreaded phenomenon of a dry winter, dusty, and herbless
as a brickfield, for hundreds of miles.
Silence falls on the plains and waters of Anabanco for the next six
months. The -wool-shed, the wash-pen, and all the huts connected with
them, are lone and voiceless as caravanserais in a city of the plague.
