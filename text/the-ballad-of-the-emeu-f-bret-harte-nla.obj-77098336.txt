THE BALLAD OF THE
EMEU.
Oh, say, have you seen at the Willows so
green,?
So charming and rurally true, ?
A singular bird, with a manner absurd,
Which they call the Australian Emeu ?
Have you
Ever seen this Australian Emeu ?
It trots all around with its head on the
ground,
Or erects it quite out of your view ;
And the ladies all cry, when its figure they
spy.


THE BALLAD OF THE EMEU.
Oh, what a sweet pretty Emeu !
Oh! do
Just look at that lovely Emeu !
One day to this spot, when the weather
was hot,
Came Matilda Hortense Fortescue ;
And beside her there came a youth of high
name, ?
Augustus Florell Montague:
The two
Both loved that wild, foreign Emeu.
With two loaves of bread then they fed it,
instead
Of the flesh of the white cockatoo,
Which once was its food in that wild
neighbourhood
Where ranges the sweet Kangaroo :
That, too,
Is the game for the famous Emeu !


THE BALLAD OF THE EMEU.
Old saws and gimlets but its appetite whets,
Like the world-famous bark of Peru ; .
There?s nothing so hard that the bird will
discard,
And nothing its taste will eschew,
That you
Can give that long-legged Emeu !
The time slipped away in t-his innocent play,
When up jumped the bsld Montague ;
? Where?s that specimen pin that I gaily
did win
In raffle, and gave unto you,
Fortescue ? ?
No word spoke the guilty Emeu !
? Quick! tell me his name whom thou
gavest that same,
Ere these hands in thy blood I imbrue! ?


THE BALLAD OF THE EMEU.
?Nay, dearest,? she cried, as she clung to
his side,
? I?m innocent as that Emeu ! ?
?Adieu!?
He replied, ?Miss M. H. Fortescue! ?
Down she dropped at his feet, all as white
as a sheet,
As wildly he fled from her view:
He thought ?twas her sin ; for he knew not
the pin
Had been gobbled up by the Emeu ;
All through
The voracity of that Emeu !
