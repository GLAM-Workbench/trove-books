TRICOLOR
KOU colour of our night, the blue of heaven:
You colour of our day, the white of light:
You colour of our blood, the essence riven
Red from Australian veins now shrunken quite:
Banner of our most gallant enemy,
Straining above our most devoted friend,
Sad glory rises from that staff to see
Proud sorrow in those folds triumphant blend.
Courage you lift! immortally to fight:
Courage you Row ! eternally to dare:
Courage you shine! in battle’s dreadful night
Seizing the sullen victory from despair:
Symbol of strength for all our living years,
Flag! we salute you on our knees, with tears.
m TOT when you led an age of chivalry
j And bright romance sang with your very name
1 Not when Napoleon Rung your standards free
To ravish kingdoms from a world in Rame:
But now, with every heart become a pyre
Where self exhales in sacrißcial love,
When children with their mothers face the Rre
And eagle’s plumes empanoply the dove:
Now when, exhausting life for country’s sake,
Leaping from the last ditch to slay the foe,
Treading a burning earth through skies aquake
Shopmen august, imperial peasants go
Without a dream of conquest, hating wars:
Ah ! now we hail you, Francois! Conquerors!


MANY have fought and fallen for you, France,
/ r ■ Man y have fought and fallen. Till the waves
Of time pass over you, you shall not dance,
You shall not sing, remembering those graves.
O soul of ardour for adventurous minds I
O source of valour for our toiling race!
We share with you the noble grief that hinds
Poor wistful men before the Godhead’s grace:
Again the centuries exalt your Rower
When every day’s magnificence of pride
Dies and is bom anew in every hour
To launch the seed of honour. By your side
Bravely indeed Australia may advance:
Fountain of light, spirit of freedom, France.
<A. G. STEPHENS.
Sydney, 13th July, 1917.
