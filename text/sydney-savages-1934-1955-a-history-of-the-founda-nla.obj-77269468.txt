FOREWORD
Nineteen fifty-five marks the twenty-first year of the Sydney Savage Club?s
existence, and it is appropriate that this Book should make its appearance during
the Club?s ?Coming-of-age? year. Quite apart, however, from the significance
of the timing, the book will put into the hands of all Savages a most valuable
record of the Club's doings since its inception. I believe that many Savages will
be surprised to learn of the extent of the Club?s activities, and Adrian Ashton s
cheerfully informal style of telling the story will attract many readers who have
had no immediate connection with the Club. It may well be, too, that in years
to come, this book may be referred to as something of the history of the times
in Sydney during the past two decades, for many welhknown names appear in
a story which covers the not unimportant part played by the Club in the cultural
development of the city?s life
Adrian Ashton has been the Club?s Honorary Secretary for all but the
first two years of the Sydney Savage Club?s life. For his enthusiastic and
indefatigable work in everything connected with the Club, Adrian was made
recently a Life Member, and no-one has better deserved that honour. In
compiling this present record, he has undertaken the vast task of reading through
an enormous amount of material ?minute books, annual reports, correspondence,
old programmes, Club magazines?in fact all the paraphernalia which has
accumulated with the years and which, fortunately, has been preserved, and all
of which has had to be conned most meticulously to glean salient facts and
interesting material. To condense all this and to tell the story in an enlivening
and entertaining style has been Adrian?s task ?truly a labour of love, for his
only reward will lie in the satisfaction of seeing the book in the hands of
Savages. How well he has succeeded will be made manifest in the pages which
follow. It only remains for me to express the Club?s keenest appreciation of
what Adrian has done, both in his long service as Honorary Secretary and in
the keen interest and untiring labour which has resulted in the compilation of
this volume.

PREFACE
The recording of the activities of the Sydney Savages over their first
years of existence has been quite a task.
Like most young bodies, when we started off we had little thought of the future;
in fact, our problems were much more immediate?that of actually staying alive. As
these pages record, we had our vicissitudes; periods full of saucy doubts and fears
and others bursting with confidence.
It was only twelve months ago that it was decided to prepare this History, so
it has meant a good deal of intensive work, searching through what records we have
and slowly weaving the pattern of our existence.
I have striven to re-create, as far as is possible in words and picture, some of
the character of Sydney Savagery that has gradually grown up over the years ?a
song, some yabba, a verse, a story, and those who have sung or told them.
I have tried, too, to give in a few lines, something of the characteristics of some
of the grand Savages who have played leading roles in making the Club what it is to-day.
Likewise to tell of our singers, our artists, our writers; the guests who have come
amongst us at our Corroborees and to our gunyah; of our nomadic comings and
goings and of our failures and our successes.
Such a History could be a dry recapitulation of events: this would be fatal, so I
have told the story in a simple, colloquial way, letting the pattern be naturally formed
by the events and personalities in our Savage life.
It has been hard work to achieve all this in the limited time, having regard to the
fact that research, collation, writing and production has had to be done in the very
limited ?spare time? of a busy life. I have, however, enjoyed every minute of it. I
have also come to the definite conclusion, having had the complete cavalcade of our
years of existence, telescoped, as it were, in my mind, that our Club is really very
worthwhile and that in one way and another a good deal has been achieved over the
past two decades. They have not been easy times either, and have encompassed the
depression, the War and the difficult years tha,t followed, hut our mutual good
fellowship has, I believe, lightened these problems.
Although I have tried meticulously to include reference to all those who have
occupied important office or played leading parts, there are, doubtless, omissions.
It is impossible to mention all those who have done great work and, of necessity, I
have had to concentrate on the highlights, for I wanted this to be a readable story,
not only to the Savages themselves but, perhaps, to others interested in these aspects
of our City?s life.
I place my offering before you, Savages, with the hope that the result of my
labours may give you some pleasure and in tangible form record some of our happy
times together.
Sydney: July, 1955. ADRIAN ASHTON.

CHAPTER I
FOUNDATION.
ON MAY 21, 1934, a circular letter was despatched to a number
of people connected with the musical and artistic life of Sydney.
It read:
?It has been decided by a number of New Zealanders
residing in Sydney to inaugurate a movement here for the
formation of a Sydney Savage Club on lines of those established
in New Zealand, and which have there met with such unique
success over a number of years.
"?The Club will be founded on the Rules and Constitution of the London Savage
Club, with certain innovations similar to those adopted in New Zealand, but
adaptable to Australia, and necessarily of restricted membership.?
It continued;
?Your name has been recommended as a Foundation Member and you are
invited accordingly to attend a meeting to be held at the Hotel Australia on Tuesday,
sth June, 1934 at 8 p.m. for the purpose of hearing a description of the movement
and of furthering the project.
?Membership of the Club will be confined to gentlemen.
?The Sydney Savage Club will aim at a high standard. It is expected that
the temperament and atmosphere of a Savage Club will be easily attainable here.?
Signatories to this epistle were H. L. S. Havyatt, Solicitor; G. C. Codlin,
Assistant General Manager, Sydney Morning Herald; C. H. Dickinson, Managing
Director, Charles Haines Advertising Ltd.; E. A. Richards, Secretary, Scott &
Holliday Ltd.
The issue of this circular was the culmination of years of dreams and months of
preliminary behind'the'scenes work by a small band of enthusiasts.
I am given to understand by Dick Havyatt that the movement for a Savage Club
in Sydney really began as a result of the welcome given by New Zealanders living
in Sydney to airman Francis Chichester, known as ?the Kiwi with wings,? when he
arrived here in January, 1930, on his solo flight from England to New Zealand.
Havyatt was Chairman of these proceedings, which naturally brought a number
of expatriate N'Zeds together and, Savagery being so strong and widespread in
their homeland, it was a short step to suggest that they should start a Club to
enlighten the benighted Aussies.
[ln 1941 the then President, Dr. William Wood, received a note from a Mr.
Roy Stanley who said that on going through some old papers, he had come across
the programme of this function. The committee as he remembered it was Chairman,
H. L. S. Havyatt; Secretary, R. F. Chapman; and Messrs. W. Beattie, C. Roy
Stanley, W. Rangi, H. F. Ferguson and E. Patterson. He recalled that a Haka was
specially written for the occasion by Mr. Beattie and the show was a great success,
some two hundred being present.}
FIRST RECORDS
The first tangible record of the actual genesis of the future Sydney Savage Club
appears in an old minute book which states that on Monday, October 30th, 1933,
at 8 p.m., a Meeting was held at the Exchange Hotel on the corner of Pitt, Bridge
and Hamilton Streets, Sydney. Mr. E. A. Richards, as convenor of the meeting,


took the Chair, others present being H. L. S. Havyatt, Len Freeman, Ernest Healey,
Eric Dare, C. H. Dickinson, and E. H. Kelly.
Mr. Richards told those present that the meeting had been called with a view
to discussing the possibility of forming a new Club in Sydney ?inasmuch as such
a project had been mooted for some time, and it was felt that the time was now
opportune.?
PROVISIONAL COMMITTEE
After general discussion the following resolution was proposed by Mr. Dickinson,
seconded by Mr. Havyatt, and carried unanimously ?that all present form themselves
into a provisional committee to go into the question of forming a Savage Club
in Sydney, and that a general meeting of those interested in the project be called
for Monday, November 13th, at 8 p.m. at the Exchange Hotel.? Mr. C. H.
Dickinson was appointed Honorary Provisional Secretary.
This November meeting was duly held. Mr. H. L. S. Havyatt was elected
Chairman, those present being H. C. Jones, G. C. Codlm, N. R. Templer, E. Healey,
G. Aickin, E. A. Richards, Eric Dare and Len Freeman.
After what is described in the Minutes as ?lengthy discussion,? it was decided
unanimously that a Savage Club be formed in Sydney and that all members joining
up to and including the inaugural function be admitted as Foundation Members.
Further, that all present at this meeting and the previous meeting, be a committee
with power to add, to further the above project. Messrs. C. H. Dickinson and
E. A. Richards were appointed Honorary Joint Provisional Secretaries.
Another meeting followed at the Exchange Hotel on January 29th, 1934 when
the Sub' Committee appointed at the previous meeting tabled draft Constitution
and Rules that had been compiled by Mr. Havyatt; after some discussion these
were adopted.
The Chairman reported that he had approached Alfred Hill in connection
with the formation of a Club Orchestra but, as he expected to be absent from
Sydney for some time, he reluctantly had to decline.
It was at this meeting that the term ?Chief Savage? is first used, Mr. Havyatt
receiving this appointment. Mr. G. C. Codlin was appointed Hon. Treasurer and
Bank of New Zealand as Bankers. Mr. Codlin was also charged with the
design of a letterhead, a task which, as far as I can ascertain, he handed over to
Mr. A. C. R. Webster, who did arTwork for the Herald at this time.
The design produced adorned the head of the first circular already mentioned
and continued to be used on Club notices and letterheads for many years. In black
and white, it consisted of four Savages whom, I have been informed, depicted four
representative races of the natives of the South Pacific Seas, dancing around a
hearthstone on which was lit the fire that was the genesis of the spirit of the
Savage Club.
Subsequent meetings were held on February 26th, March 12th and March
in the evening after dinner at the Exchange Hotel, with genial Len Freeman looking
a ter the inner man with his usual efficient care for such important matters. When
I was discussing these early days with him, he reminisced on the various characters
m terms of their interiors: ?I used to get a little bit of tripe for Codlin who had
a weak stomach; always had fish sandwiches on Friday to be on the safe side?-
and so he rambled on with his gastronomic biographies.
Points of interest in these minutes are the appointment of Frank Hutchens as
Hon. Musical Director and E. H. Kelly as Hon. Auditor; a letter from Col A E
Loach, Secretary of the Association of Kindred Clubs, New Zealand, advising that
he would probably pay a visit to Sydney to attend the opening function of the new
Club; and the inspection of the Arts Club as a possible meeting nlarr


THE AUSTRALIA MEETING
The preliminary exploratory work
completed, the stage was now all set for
the big gathering of the clan to be. It was
decided to hold this at the Hotel Australia.
No half measures in this promotion!
The initial instigators had undobtedly
done good work and their zeal was
rewarded by a well attended meeting at
the Australia Hotel on June sth, 1934.
In addition to the Organising Committee,
the following were present as a result of
the circular letters that had been sent out
and, in the interests of history, the names
are recorded: Messrs. C. J. Harvey Maple,
T. W. Rapley, H. L. Cross, E. I. Proud,
L. Rowson, James M. Dunlop, C. L.
Williams, Capt. J. D. Frew, L. J. Schmitt,
Jack Win, A. E. Rudder, A. J. Johnstone,
L. Macintosh Ellis, H. G. Guinness, H
Meredith, W. F. Hessell, A. C. R. Web-
ster, R. F. Chapman, G. A. Wilson, R.
Avison, Capt. W. P. Clifton-Mogg, S. O.
Boldero, John E. Winsloe, J. W. Atkin-
son, H. R. Hill, Comm. C. H. Rolleston
R.N. (ret?d.).
Organising Committee Chairman H.
L. S. Havyatt presided and, after outlining
the work already performed by the Com-
mittee, he spoke of the proposed activities
and spirit of the Club and the support
already promised. He also informed the
H. L. S. HAVYATT
Chief Savage 1934-35; President 1935-37,
who played a leading part in the Club?s
foundation and launching.
meeting of the following points: the Constitution and Rules had been modelled on
the lines of the New Zealand Savage Clubs ?with certain alterations to meet with
Australian ideas?; the Association of Kindred Clubs of New Zealand had advised
that it would be sending, as a mark of kinship, a Maori ?mere? as the Chairman?s
gavel for the Club; that the annual membership subscription had been fixed at
two guineas per annum. He also named the ?Honorary appointments? that had
already been made by the Organising Committee with a view to setting the Club in
motion.
THE CLUB IS FORMED
The following resolution was in due course put to the meeting and carried
unanimously: ?that the Organising Committee?s actions as reported to this meeting
be adopted, and that the Sydney Savage Club be and is hereby formed under the
Constitution and rules already drawn up by the Organising Committee.?
And so on June sth, 1934, the Sydney Savage Club was born.
Judging from the second resolution that immediately followed, it could easily

have been stilhborn, for this read: ?that the Club does not function until subscriptions
from one hundred members are in hand and that same be paid to the Honorary
Treasurer, Mr. G. C. Codlin and the Honorary Auditor, Mr. E. H. Kelly to be
held in trust by them until the full one hundred subscriptions are in hand, and to
be returned unless that number of subscriptions be paid on or before June 30th,
or such extension of time as the Committee deems advisable.?
Four other resolutions followed: that a Ways and Means Committee be formed;
that the Club apply for affiliation with the London Savage Club, the Melbourne
Savage Club, and the Association of Kindred Clubs, New Zealand; that each person
present undertakes to do his best to increase the membership to the Club by suitable
nominations, and finally, that the nominations for Patron and President and
Vice' Presidents, be deferred until the necessary membership is obtained.
Having put all this sound business behind them, our Savage progenitors
apparently relaxed from their labours and became true Savages, for the minute
records that toasts to the Sydney Savage Club and the Organising Committee were
drunk and they must have been very dry after those six solid resolutions!
THE GALLANT FIRST HUNDRED
The Ways and Means Committee appointed consisted of Commander C. H.
Rolleston, R.N. (ret?d.), Major H. Grattan Guinness, Captain W. P. Clifton-Mogg,
and Messrs. H. L. Cross, E. I. Proud and Jack Win, and with Naval and Military
it swung into intensive strategic action to secure that vital first hundred ?bodies.?

the new Sydney Savage Club insignia, went
forward to selected ?gentlemen? who had the
right ideas on Savagery-?and, it was hoped, the
necessary two guineas. ?Any of those whose
names appear in this or the previous letter,?
said the persuasive circular, ?will he only to
glad to explain what a "Savage Club? really
is, though the London institution of the
same name is so welhknown that this explana'
tion will generally be superfluous.? ?Unique
social enjoyment? was promised to those who
would gird up their loins and espouse the
Savage cause. The Organising Committee on
the latter circular had been expanded to embrace
Messrs. G. C. Codlin, C. H. Dickinson, Gordon
Aickin, Eric Dare, L. Freeman, H. L. S. Havyatt,
E. Healey, H. C. Jones, E. H. Kelly, E. A.
Richards and N. R. Templer It was at this
point that Savage C. H. Dickinson asked to be
relieved of the position of Joint Hon. Secretary,
and Gordon Aickin took his place with E. A.
Richards.

INAUGURAL LUNCHEON
The zeal of the enthusiastic brethren apparently bore early fruit, for an elaborate
invitation card went forward advising that on Friday, July 27th, at 12.45 p.m., ?a
luncheon of Club members would be held in the Auditorium at David Jones
Limbed, Elizabeth Street, when Colonel A. E. Loach, Secretary of the Association
of Kindred Clubs, New Zealand, will, on behalf of that Association, present to our
Club a Chairman?s gavel which he has brought over from New Zealand."
On the bottom of the card was stated: ?It is an ancient custom that no Savage
is absent when the tribe gathers for food.? It tactfully didn?t add: ?Try and keep
them away when the grog?s on.? The luncheon charge was 2/6. We paid D.J.s 2/-.
A meticulously typed list, prepared by Gordon Aickin, enables me to give the
complete list of sixty-four names of those who attended: Professor Randal Wood-
house, G. L. Aickin, L. Freeman, E. Dare, E. A. Richards, H. B. Duckworth,
L. B. Hart, A. Collins, D. Lorimer, H. F. Herbert, H. L. S. Havyatt, G. A. Wilson,
W. R. Charlton, H. J. Johnstone, E. J. Hyde, J. E. Wms l oe, E. F. Hessell, H. H.

Capt. J. D. Frew, J. W. Atkinson, Seymour Pank, L. Macintosh Ellis, A. C. R.

Gregory, E. H. Kelly, E. J. Gravestock, G. L. Murray, J. A. C. Brouvers, H. G.
Weatherley, Dr. Derby Loudon, F. Goldberg, Sir Arthur Rickard, Eric Ramsden,
H. L. Cross, Frank Hutchens, Dr. Crouch, Lloyd Davies. L. J. Schmitt, Comdr.
C. H. Rolleston, H. R. Hill, G. N. Baggett, S. S. Crick, W. H. Geake, E. C. S.
Marshall, Alexander Macdonald, W. J. Lorimer, Harvey Maple, Capt. Clifton-Mogg,
and a Mr. Woodgate. Complimentary tickets were sent to Mr. W. H. Childs,


Commisstioner of Police, Mr. T. F. Sullivan, President of the Clock Club, Mr.
Smith, President of the Smith Family, Mr. Boyce, President of the Neutral Bay
Orphans? Club, Mr. Brunsden Fletcher, Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, and
to representatives of The Bulletin, Daily Telegraph and Sun.
The gavel, which was duly presented by Col. Loach, was a handsome gift, the
business end being a large tooth from a killer whale, which had been stranded off
the shores of the west coast of New Zealand, while the haft or handle was from the
antler of a stag shot in North Canterbury.
Upon the whale tooth is engraved ?Ake Ake Kia Kaha? (literal translation;
?For ever be strong?; also used in Maori songs in a sense akin to our ?For he?s a
jolly good fellow"), ?from New Zealand Kindred Clubs. June 1934.? Beneath this
inscription is a Kiwi, standing with great dexterity upon one leg, shaking hands with
a Kangaroo, which has a bit of a list to starboard and is finding his tail very useful
for support. Underneath are the Maori words of Welcome Haere Mai.
Presumably the upright Kiwi is the gallant Colonel and the Kangaroo a Sydney
Savage after an extra good Corroboree.
This initial luncheon was an outstanding success, the presence of Colonel Loach
giving the function the official imprimatur of New Zealand Savagery, so that when
they left David Jones? Auditorium the original band of enthusiasts were full of good
cheer and confidence as to the future progress of the newlyTounded Sydney Savage
Club.
Colonel ?Bertie? Loach, so well known and liked by all New Zealand Savages,
has always had a soft spot in his heart for his Australian offspring and, over the
years, we have continued to exchange letters and Christmas greetings. Now full
of years, he has at last relinquished the post he had held for so long and is spending
the evening of his life in the Rannerdale Veterans? Home at Christchurch. May
this old soldier' Savage have many years before him.
THE FIRST CORROBOREE
No time was wasted in following up this success and the first ?Corroboree? was
held on Friday, 24th August, 1934, at the Arts Club, 220 Pitt Street, Sydney. The
choice of location was a happy one, for the Arts Club, with its spacious hall and
lofty pitched roof, entered across a little paved courtyard, had an attractive character
of its own, and many of the early Savages feel that never since have we been able
to secure a gunyah that had such ?Savage? atmosphere.
H. L. S. Havyatt, who had played a leading role in the formation and organising
of the infant Club up to the present time, appropriately took the Chair as the ?Chief
Savage,? during the first part of the programme, later handing over the gavel to
a chairman selected by Savages of the Sydney Conservatonum of Music, who were
providing the programme.
SAVAGE CHARACTER CREATED
The programme brochure prepared for the first Corroboree was a masterpiece,
and although in the years to follow Joe Collins produced many splendid programmes
and drawings for the Club, he probably never excelled himself more than on this
initial occasion when, with no precedent, he in one stroke of genius, created the
character of the new Savage organisation in Australia. It had a black cover from
which, in subtle tones of white, grey and red, gleamed the happy face of an
aboriginal warrior above the words ?First Savage Corroboree, Sydney, Aug. 24th,
1934.? Inside, the contents were printed in black on grey paper while the whole
was bound with green raffia. A number of the original Savages still jealously prize
their copy.


I noted in the minute book that ?expenditure of approximately �lO on Souvenir
Programmes for the First Corroboree was agreed to,? and subsequently an account
from Smith 6s? Julius (Joe Collins? firm) for �l3/3/6 was paid for this magnificent
job which today would cost at least ten times as much. Even allowing for the
inflation that has gone on since then, it is obvious that both Joe and his firm
had been most generous in terms of money as well as time to help the infant Club
on its way.
When I assumed the Secretaryship in 1936, "Rich? Richards handed me a
large cardboard box full of miscellaneous papers, letters and notices all bundled in
anyhow, which represented the filing cabinet and complete effects of the Club from
foundation to that date. At the bottom was a brown paper parcel which, on
investigation, was found to contain the blocks used for this Programme, and I?ve
kept them ever since.
In view of the importance of this first Programme in our Foundation and
Tradition, it is reproduced in full in the following pages. Unfortunately the colour
blocks for the cover were missing: I?ve a vague idea they may have been used to
make Savage heads which, mounted on cardboard, -cut out, and strung with raffia,
were hung around the necks of the Lubras at the first Ladies' Night. Probably after
languishing on some printer?s shelves for years they were thrown out as scrap.
New blocks have, however, been made from the original Programme, for I
couldn?t conceive any better cover for this History than that drawn by Joe Collins
in his first Savage creation. The only difference is that in place of the words ?First
Savage Corroboree, Sydney, Aug. 24th, 1934,? the title "Sydney Savage Club,
1934H955, by Adrian Ashton? has been substituted.
And so on this August eve in the year of Our Lord, One Thousand Nine
Hundred and Thirtyffour, Savagery was born in Sydney Town, a unique product
of the genius and goodwill of many fine men, some of whom are no longer with us.
To, in one stroke, bring to life in this new land this intangible atmosphere that
we call Savagery, was a great achievement. Something had indeed been created.
It is our privilege to enjoy it and to pass it on.

OPENING ODE
Now let the philistine depart,
And in his darkness perish,
For we are met with single heart
To praise the things we cherish
?
We praise the mind where reason shines
The soul that does not falter;
The patient hand of art that twines
A wreath for beauty?s altar
?
We praise the lips that love the taste
Of love and wine and laughter,
And count to-day too sweet to waste
On dreams of dim hereafter
9
The wise, the understanding heart,
The kindly hand we cherish:
Then let the philistine depart
And in his darkness perish.

IT WAS IMMEDIATELY apparent that the general form
and conduct of the Corroboree appealed to the new Sydney
Savages and it is obvious that its character and atmosphere was
appropriate, for it has changed very little in essence over the
past twenty-one years.
Encouraged by the undoubted success of the Foundation
Corroboree, it was decided to follow up in September with a

ESTABLISHMENT.
second. Savage Havyatt again acted as Chairman for the first part of the evening
and then handed over to Savage Albert Collins. As already emphasized, Joe
Collins, as he was universally known, had been the facile brain and skilful hand
behind?the production of the first Savage Club programme and it was he more than
anyone else who was responsible for the creation of what we call the Savage
atmosphere. New Zealand Savages had absorbed a Maori theme and character
through their ritual. Joe Collins conceived the idea of embracing in the Sydney
Club the distinctive art of the Australian aboriginal.
joe was a unique personality. He was an outstanding commercial artist, a
sensitive landscape painter, a keen and competent actor and, as Uncle Joe, for
many years delighted thousands of children over the Argonaut s Session of the
Australian Broadcasting Commission.
At these early Corroborees, Joe Collins tubby and sprightly was at his
forte, and his inimitable humour and quick wit delighted all who came along. His
many-sided ability and bubbling enthusiasm were undoubtedly very vital factors in
the consolidation of the infant Club.
EARLY CORROBOREES
The monthly Corroborees were now established and in October, at the third,
the evening was conducted by Savage Albert Cazabon, an outstanding musician
who, at that stage, was conductor of the fine orchestra at the Prince Edward Theatre.
These were palmy days indeed, for I noted, going through those early minutes,
that dapper little Joe Moss is thanked for the gift of a case of whisky that he had
sent along to enliven proceedings.
At the fourth Corroboree in November, Savage Howard Carr, another leading
musician, took charge of the entertainment of the evening and for the first time in
the notice paper we have reference to official guests who were being entertained
by the Club. These were the principal executives of the Citizens of Sydney
Organising Committee who were responsible for the City Pageant and Festivities
during the ?present Royal Visit? ?that of the Duke of Gloucester. Major T. W.
Conder, General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, was also
present, thus marking the beginning of the association of the Club with the expand-
ing field of radio.
For the occasion Howard came forward with A Savage Toast, ?doggerel and
ditty? by himself.
You?re a good chap! You?re a good chap!
And we see you like your beer!
You?ve won the hearts of the Savage Club
So we greet you with a cheer!

The practice of decoration with native weapons and suchlike had also become
established and the old book and curiosity character, James R. Tyrrell, had been
given a standing order at a pound per Corroboree to supply native paraphernalia to
give our gunyah an appropriate appearance.
The fifth Corroboree on December 20th, 1934, broadly took the form of a
Christmas gathering our first Savage Christmas and the forerunner of many
similar happy times together.
ALFRED HILL
The Club then went into recess until April a custom that we have continued
to follow and we find the sixth Corroboree taking place on April 30th 1935.
Dick Havyatt was still Chief Savage, and the custom of handing over the gavel for
the remainder of the evening was still observed, on this occasion Savage Alfred Hill
hfing to do the honours, this being the first official reference in the archives
that we find of Club activity by this grand old man of Australian music who at 83
is still as virile and forthright as ever and to whom, in 1953, we paid tribu?te at a
special Corroboree in his honour.
Alfred Hill is no yes? man, and has always believed in saying just what he
thinks without any embellishment. Over the years he has given us some stringent
?criticism when he thought perhaps we were straying from the path of pure art.
He worships at one shrine only musical sincerity and some of the contemporary
alleged music causes sparks to fly from the ends of his moustache.
(This l etter , in response to our congratulations on his winning the A.B.C.
bong Competition, written several years later in his thin spidery hand"and cramped
into a little panel on the right'hand side of the paper, is typical).
Dear Mr. Ashton,
Many thanks for your letter of congratulations. I
don t know if the Savage Club were aware of my
recent Concert, given by the A.B.C. for the
Celebrations. I did not see any members there
Yours sincerely,
, 7 n , c w ALFRED HILL.

Guests of this Sixth Corroboree were Mr. Richard Windeyer K C President
and other executive members of The Players' Club, which rendered a One Acf
Play, written by one of their mem'
bers, Dr. Mac Luker, entitled ?Judas
w3.s 3, Gentleman. (A[.B. In spite
of this claim to fulfil the require'
ments for Club membership as set
out in our first circular, he was
inexplicably blackballed).
Apparently it was being found
that a little discipline was required
by the Savages, for the following
warning appears in the Notice: ?It

before 8.30 and admission for latecomers will then be made only
items. The Sergeant-at-Arms, Savage George Brown, will be on the door.
We were evidently also beginning to become responsible and respectable, for
a P.S. advised that ?a printed copy of the Chib?s Constitution and Rules will be
distributed to members that evening.
BEER MUG FIASCO
That Savages are very human in their capacity to procrastinate is rather
apparent, browsing through the original Minute Book and noting the various
references to the beer mug project. Very early in the piece it was suggested that
beer mugs should be purchased for use at Corroborees; a drawing was submitted
by a leading manufacturer and Council recommended that a gross should be
purchased. Samples at 2/9 each were submitted and, with an eye to business, it
was decided that they should be resold to Savages for the princely sum of 3/'.
Apparently, however, there was a change of heart, for a subsequent minute records
that the Club purchased the six sample mugs only, the onus for buying others being
placed upon the Savages themselves.
The matter rested for a few months and then, following Council s request.
Savage Ernie Proud submitted some pewter beer mugs at 13/6 each, engraving of
lettering to be extra. The next reference is some months later when we find
Savage Secretary Richards bringing forward some moulded beer tankards it being
decided that 150 of these be purchased, details of embossing to be left m his hands.
Operation Beer Mug, however, did not seem to prosper and a new scheme
was put forward that members should pay a guinea for a beer mug which should
be presented to them with due ceremony on their birthdays. Apparently either
the guinea, or the tactless reference to the fact that another good year had gone by,
was fatal, for after that the project seemed to die. That apparently is the reason
why we still quaff our ale out of ordinary inadequate glasses ala caterer. We really
ought to try once more to do something about it. One in the shape of an atomic
bomb would be an appropriate way of showing a Savage s contempt for H-bomb
hysteria.


FIRST PRESIDENT ELECTED
The First Annual Meeting was conducted on May 17th, 1935, prior to the
Seventh Corroboree, and important constitutional changes took place in the
appointment of Savage H. L. S. Havyatt, who had been acting since the initial
corroboree Chief Savage, to the position of President, while Savage H. L. Cross
was appointed Vice-President. Joe Collins, in view of his great activity in both
the establishment of the Club and the development of its Savage character, was
appointed Chief Savage at this meeting, thus separating the President, who became
t e titular head of the Club, and the Chief Savage, whose task it was to conduct
t. e orroboree, and setting the pattern which ever since we have continued to
observe.
The stalwarts who had weathered the foundation year and had come along to
this first Annual Meeting, were as follows: H. L. S. Havyatt, E. A. Richards, K. W.
Hart, H. V. Heath, L. J. Loneragan, E. H. Kelly, G. L. Aickin, E. J. Gravestock,
S. O. Bolder�, E. Healey, J. E. Wmsloe, A. Davidson, J. Moss, F. Corkhill,
H. L. Cross, Bruce Dellit, J. W. Atkinson, A. D. Cuffe, F. Newson/w. J. Monk,
E G Gordon, Lloyd Davies, E. J. Hyde, E. Dare, H. Roberts, B. H. Andrew, Milton
Chick, F. Stuart, A. Collins, J. D. Frew, R. A. Money, G. A. Wilson, E. R.
Badgery-Parker, E. de Launay, J. J. Elder, Alfred Hill, A. H. Hyman, B. Kerr,
W. E. Lewis, F. A. Hamlin, N. Monkman, H. Bowden, F. W. Larkins, H. A. Walker?
C. D. Bissett, L. Lord, C. R. Nilsson, L. Hodgins, E. A. F. Smith.
It would seem that the Club was not in the red ?or at least not too much
so for the balance sheet was adopted and the Honorary Treasurer and Honorary
Auditor re-elected unanimously. And so the first year of Savagery in Sydney had
been successfully negotiated.
Having put this necessary business behind them the brethren proceeded to
enjoy themselves at the Corroboree that followed, another well-known Sydney
personality, Savage Harald Bowden of J. C. Williamson Ltd., taking charge of the
evening which, said the relevant notice paper, ?will partake of a theatrical flavour.?
Knowing Harald we can be sure the flavour was piquant and the tempo fast.
Those early Savages were tigers for punishment; just look at the programme
for this Seventh Corroboree which followed on the First Annual Meeting that was
held at 8 p.m. None of this early to bed rubbish ?or early closing either. The
last item on the bill doesn?t come on till 12.15 a.m., assuming that they were on time,
which a Corroboree seldom is.

was very representative of the musical talent of the day and included Savage Howard
Carr, Chairman, Harald Bowden, Secretary, Lloyd Davies, Alfred Hill, E. J.
Gravestock, Joe Collins, Fred Hyde, Ewart Chappie, J. W. Atkinson and H. L. S.
Havyatt.
The Club was established. The Savages were happy in their meeting house
at the Arts Club and embarked with enthusiasm upon their second year of existence
which followed the pattern and tradition that had already begun to take form and
jell in our Savage hearts.


f-.
CAME THE ?MOON-EYED LUBRAS?
Conception and birth safely over and both progenitors and lusty young Savage
offspring all doing wdl, the thought occurred to a number of those who had been
oevoting a lot of time to the early stages of the Club, no doubt necessitating many
night meetings and late arrivals home to dinner, that a Ladies? Night would be an
appropriate gesture to ensure harmony on the home front.
For 364 days of the year the ladies play no part in the life of a Savage (so we
uke think!) but on the one night of the year when we have the ?moon'eyed
Jubras amongst us, the sky?s the limit to turning on a ripmoaring Corroboree for
their enjoyment.
The Eighth Corroboree and first Ladies? Night was held on Friday, June 21st,

avage . . Havyatt, into his new post of Chief Savage to conduct proceedings
and was decorated with the badge of office which still adorns the neck and tickles
the fancy of our Chief Savages.

INTERESTING PEOPLE
As the months passed interesting names in both
artists and guests appeared on the monthly notice papers.
Professors A. H. Chartens and E. G. Waterhouse
from the University, and Mr. H. S. Dettmann, Sydney
Grammar School Head, graced one Corroboree, while
Sydney Ure Smith and A. Datillo Rubbo, were at
another, the Tenth, when Chief Savage Joe Collins
handed over the gavel later in the evening to Savage
Jim Bancks, creator of the immortal Ginger Meggs and
who on more than one occasion at subsequent Cor'
roborees convulsed his Savage confreres by his droll
stories told with such dry wit which made him an
artist of words quite apart from his skill as a cartoonist,
I can still remember him telling us, without a smile on
HARALD BOWDEN


his face, the imaginary experiences of his legendary uncle in relation to a certam
underground comfort station in Martin Place?since immortalised by a clock rampant.
What names to play with! Sydney Ure Smith, the amazingly versatile artist
who has left such a mark on the surface of Sydney as a result of his work as an
etcher and draughtsman, as President of the Society of Artists for twenty-five years,
founder of ?Art in Australia,? ?The Home,? and publisher of so many outstanding
books. He loved good food, good drink and good company, so was very much at
home with the Savages. Some idea of the unique contribution that this man made
to the public appreciation of art in this country was made strikingly apparent in
the exhibitions of his works, both artistic and literary, which were held following
his untimely death in 1950.
And Cavaliere Datillo Rubbo, the delightful Italian-Australian artist who is
still amongst us and who was not only a fine painter of portraits, in which he
captured the character of age and often suffering which he found upon the ancient
visages of many of the old men whom he delighted to paint, but also one of our
greatest teachers. Through his atelier in Bligh Street, passed many of the talented
artists of to-day, and with Julian Ashton he has left an indelible mark upon the
artistic life of our community through the teaching that he has implanted in the
minds and hands of others.
The Club has ever been universal in its outlook, believing that the size of a man,
to use the words by G. K. Chesterton, often quoted in later years by Jim Brunton
Gibb, ?depends on the height of his ideals, the depth of his convictions and the

years, in his songs and verses, given

breadth of his sympathies and interests.?
Thus we find at a Corroboree coinciding
with Scout Week, Colonel John Maughan,
Chief Commissioner for Scouts, coming along
and doing his good deed for the day by telling
us of this great movement. Denzil Bachelor
spoke at another, whilst our association with
the sporting side of things was dramatically
pin-pointed by the presence of the notorious
mat-strangler, Tom Lurich, who with some
unfortunate partner gave a wrestling demon-
stration.
JIM BRUNTON GIBB.
It was on this programme, at the Twelfth
Corroboree, on October 18th, 1935, that the
one and only James Brunton Gibb?billed as
Elocutionist?first appeared before the Savages
whom he has never once since failed to de-
light with his inimitable skill as elocutionist,
raconteur and compere, as over the years he
has almost continuously filled the offices of

dent.

They did themselves well in those days and started olf the Fourteenth
Corroboree with a Christmas Dinner at the Arts Club, the cost of which, nota bene,
was 6/6 per head. I noticed a rather amusing sidelight on this Christmas dinner in
the Minute Book which suggested that the Savages who controlled the privy purse
could be quite hard business men when the occasion arose. The minute records that
?it was decided that only half of the account for the Christmas Corroboree should
be paid and that a sub-committee of three would interview the caterers on the
question of the settlement of the balance in view of the dissatisfaction regarding
service and terms.? Fancy having the temerity to question service and terms these
days. I did not come across any further reference to this matter so presumably it
was fixed up satisfactorily to both parties.
The Club must have been beginning to expand fairly well about this time but
evidently some felt that perhaps the gates had been made a little bit too open, for
one reads in the minutes of the Council Meeting of May 29th, 1935, ?that Council
decided to accept the advice of the House Committee and consider that any increase
of membership should be along conservative lines and calculated to further the
objects of the Club.?
ERIC GORDON
JOE COLLINS
in happy mood.


?
AND SO WE come to the year 1936, which was an important
one for me, and I also like to feel marked an event that has
made some contribution to the maintenance and development
of the Club, for it was on June 3rd, 1936, that I was appointed
Honorary Secretary of the Sydney Savage Club.
CHAPTER III
VICISSITUDES
ADRIAN ASHTON, HON. SECRETARY
It came about like this. Eric Gordon was one of the Savages who joined up
in the first year. He was an artistic and sporting type who conducted an organization
that undertook all types of advertising and display work. I had designed a display
for the Orient Company at the Royal Easter Show and had engaged Eric?s firm to
carry out the work which they did in due course with their usual skill and speed that
was essential in such work which had to be executed in the few days immediately
preceding the Show. As zero hour approached, Eric virtually lived at the Show-
ground for he had many more exhibits than mine and was usually a haggard wreck
after working right through the last few nights to achieve the finishing touches.
Early on in the project we were
discussing details in my office in
Kembla Building and Eric said to
me: ?Have you been along to the
Savage Club?" I replied that I had
not. We talked further and looking
at me rather quizzically across my
office desk he said: ?You know, you
are just the sort of chap who would
make an ideal secretary for the
Club.? I modestly demurred, but
he explained that Savage Richards,
who had acted as Honorary Sec-
retary to date, wished to withdraw
owing to business activity and a
new Secretary was required. He
gave all sorts of reasons. My grand-
father, James Ashton, had been a
prominent artist; my father, Will
Ashton, was a well-known land-
scape painter, and I had been
brought up in artistic surroundings
and knew many of the artists of
Sydney. My profession was one that
should be adequately represented in
such a Club, and so, thoroughly
interested, I weakened and it was
arranged that I should meet some
of the executive, and a small
luncheon was arranged.

I can remember it very clearly. We went to the Florentine Restaurant which
is still in the basement of a building in Elizabeth Street next door to the Prince
Edward Theatre. Savages Dick Havyatt, Joe Collins, and Secretary Richards
commonly known as Rich. were there. We yarned, wrestled with spaghetti,
and at the end of the meal it was agreed all round that I should become the new
Honorary Secretary of the Club. This was recommended to the Council on May
20th and confirmed on 3rd June, 1936, by the new Council elected at the Second
Annual Meeting. And so commenced a very happy association lasting now nineteen
years: God and the Savages willing I trust it may continue for many more.
The Savage Club has meant a lot to me and occupies an important place in
my life. It has been my pleasure to meet in both work and play, many fine, out'
standing and gifted personalities, and in its ranks I number some of my closest
friends. We have had our ups and downs and over the years through my long
experience I believe I have been able to assist from time to time in keeping the Club
upon its chosen path. Many good Savages who have been amongst us during me
long term are no longer with us and one of the hardest parts of my job is saying
good'bye, on behalf of their Savage brothers, to these Savages when their time
has come, and penning letters conveying our sorrow to those they have left behind.
The first Minute that I recorded was one of the Executive Committee held at
the good old Exchange Hotel on June 25th, 1936. It was written by hand in a fist
much better than my caligraphy today (which is not saying much) and quite
different from Rich?s rounded hand.
TREVOR DANIEL
It was at this period that the Club also gained another of its Honorary Officers
TREVOR DANIEL
Honorary Treasurer since 1936.
in the person of Savage Trevor Daniel
who has been Honorary Treasurer ever
since. Trevor took over from Savage G.
C. Codlin who, as Assistant General
Manager of "The Sydney Morning
Herald,? was finding he was unable to
carry on as Club Hon. Treasurer owing
to this onerous position. Savage Codlin
later went to Melbourne to join "The
Argus and Australasian" and subsequently
was transferred to London. He was re*
turning to Australia during the first four
weeks of the War when his ship, the
"Imperial Star," was torpedoed and he
and his wife were never heard of again.
1 never met him
Trevor Daniel, a young Welshman
from Swansea (indeed to goodness) was
associated with Savage Joe Weatherley
in the latter?s Accountancy practice. Joe
was an enthusiastic, early Savage who
loved the relaxation of singing?and still
does, being a leading light?or voice?in
the Sydney Male Choir. It was Joe who


nominated Trevor to the Club and as the Welshman was quite a young man he
had to run the gauntlet of an interview with no less a person than President Havyatt
because he was the youngest applicant for membership up to that stage. Trevor
and the Club were fortunate on his attaining Membership for within a matter of
months he became Honorary Treasurer, completely taking over the Club?s financial
affairs which he has handled meticulously and efficiently ever since. A grateful
Club over the years has bestowed upon him an Honour Plaque and conferred Life
Membership. He was the fourth Savage thus honoured.
Some years ago Joe Weatherley invited a few Savages to the Exchange Hotel
fvhere, with Len Freeman fussing around in his usual solicitous manner, the
acceptance of Trevor into Joe?s firm as a Partner was celebrated over a few tankards
of foaming ale. To-day Joe has relinquished his active connection with the
organisation of which Trevor is now the Senior Partner.
FIRST SPORTING EVENT
Our first sporting activity took place on March 10th, 1936, with golf and bowls
at the Australian Golf Club at Kensington, Savages Havyatt and Cross donating small
cups as trophies. At the conclusion of the day, after the weary and frustrated
sportsmen had showered and relaxed, a dinner and Corroboree followed at which
members of the golf club were our guests. Harold Cross handled all the sporting
arrangements and his circulars terminated with the slogan that adorned his office
desk, ?Do it now.? It was a great success and the golfers and the Savages found
many a common bond, both spiritual and verbal.
Monthly Luncheons were inaugurated in February and April at the Arts Club
and the Second Annual Meeting followed at the Australia Hotel on May 30th, 1936,
all the major officebearers being re-elected.
The Third Year of Savagery commenced with the 16th Corroboree on June
19th, 1936, at the Arts Club. ?Don?t be selfish, Brother Savage,?? I said in my first
monthly notice, ?bring along one of your benighted friends that he may see the
bright lights of Savagery. The subscription is but 5/- and you may be kindling a
spark that will flame to membership.?? Even then I was battling about returning
reply slips: ?So as to assist your Secretary,? it continued, ?please go to the trouble of
filling in the form at the bottom of the page and of trying out the perforations.?
?KOORA-NA-BOON?
As all Savages are well aware, the word ?Koora-na-boon? plays a dominant part
in Savage life, for in addition to its ritualistic usage to express our appreciation at
Corroborees, its simple meaning, ?Sit down all about brother,? epitomises our
attitude to life and our fellow-man. lam not quite clear when it was first used, but
it was introduced by Savage Dick Havyatt in the very early days. The first time it
appears in any records is on this first circular that I sent out in June, 1936, the word
being used as a heading, and also prior to the signature, in the place of the usual
?yours faithfully? or ?yours sincerely.? This custom has been continued in Savage
correspondence.
Dick Havyatt, as already intimated, was a native born New Zealander, though
he has lived most of his life in Australia. Like Savage Joe Collins, he grew
up as a boy in fairly close contact with the wild and highly imaginative Maori


warriors who were still a terror and yet held in high admiration and respect by the
young white boys who had sufficient interest or imagination to appreciate their
ceremonies and ways of life. It was natural, therefore, in establishing the new Club
that he should wish to introduce some similar ritual and atmosphere.
He tells how the word "Koora-na-boon? came about: ?
?The word ?Koora-na-boon? is the equivalent in the language of the aboriginal
tribe from which the expression was obtained, to "Sit down, all about, brother.?
It was used by the tribe that inhabited, in the days long gone by, the Northern lands
between Sydney Harbour and Newcastle, so I was informed by the late Savage
Grosvenor A. Francis, a Solicitor in Sydney at the time and one who had made some
study of the various aboriginal languages in the vicinity of Sydney Harbour.
"What I sought was an expression something like the Maori one ?Kia-ora,? which
I explained meant in the language of the Maori, ?Brother, at the hearthstone of the
tribe, I salute you?; that is a somewhat free translation but it does convey the meaning
of the Maori expression. Savage Francis, on giving the matter some thought, came
forward with the expression ?Koora-na-boon.?
"The fire on the hearthstone and the four savages dancing around it expresses
the fidelity to all races and to all people (in other words Vibes?) who enjoy the
hearthstone or warmth of welcome of the Sydney Savage Club. With the Australian
aborigines and the South Pacific natives, the hearthstone or fire was where friends
met and enjoyed the hospitality of the tribe. Most of the South Pacific natives,
including the Maoris, speak of that type of hearthstone as the ?Kai-anga? which
means the place where the good food is cooked.
"Hence you see the true significance of the expression ?Koora-na-boon,? and
when it was explained to the original members of the Sydney Savage Club the word
met with spontaneous and unanimous acceptance.?
The Second Ladies? Night came along at the Arts Club on Friday, July 17th,
1936. Catering costs were 3/9 a head with a guarantee of 300, price of tickets to
Savages being 7/6 each. ?The Chief Savage desires that you be within the Meeting
Hall at 8.15, so that he can start work with his Gong, Gavel and his new Pewter ac
8.30,? so ran the notice. Milton Chick, an advertising man, had taken over the
onerous task of Programme Director and brought together a first-class programme.
I think I am right in saying that it was on this occasion, or at a Corroboree
very near it, that old Professor Randal Woodhouse, who was nearing eighty and was
a striking figure with his brown velvet coat and white mane of hair, stood up on the
dais and sang with peculiar sweetness, "Bonnie Mary of Argyle.? He was a charming
old gentleman and his remarkable performances at this great age made him a great
favourite with the Savages. If my recollections of this night are a little vague I
know I 11 be excused for I had a certain very charming young lady with me who in
the following February became the Secretary?s Lady and who made reference to her
eighteen years of Savagery when last year at the Ladies? Night she responded, rather
nicely I thought, for the first time on behalf of the Moon-eyed Lubras.
WE HAVE TO MOVE
In spite of our gaiety there was a touch of nostalgic sadness in the revels of
those of us who had recently heard that we had to leave our home and the birthplace
of Sydney Savagery.
The building that housed the Arts Club was about to bow to progress (sic) in
that the Piccadilly Arcade was planned to run from Pitt Street to Castlereagh Street


and drastic alterations would result. So the second Ladies? Night was our swaivsong
at the old Arts Club, which was, as already indicated, an ideal location for such a
Club as ours. In the August circular I said ?as you are all probably now aware,
with the annual 'feast of the Moomeyed Lubras,? we have been forced to forsake
our household gods at 220 Pitt Street. We are all sad because, as President Savage
Havyatt has said, we believe that there was born something that is destined to live
and grow in Australia. Yet we know that this 'something 1 to which he referred
and we all understand is in our Savage breasts to go where we go.?
Even then it was a hard task to find some other place to meet and a number of
locations including the Wentworth, were inspected by a worried Council, before
alternative accommodation was found.
THE AUSTRALIAN HALL
It was the Australian Hall, 148 Elizabeth Street, Sydney, and I would say
unequivocally that we disliked it from the start. It was bare and unsympathetic and
had no Savage atmosphere whatsoever. However, with no alternative offering,
we had the first Corroboree there on August 21st, 1936, and the next on September
18th. We tried to kid ourselves we liked it, quoting the advantage of the parking
station next door (6d. per night) and stressed in the notice that "to take full
advantage of these new facilities it is essential that there is a large gathering,? but
we missed the warmth and intimacy of the Arts Club.
I endeavoured to build up morale in the words of Kipling, which Jim Brunton
Gibb had quoted at the previous Corroboree.
It ain?t the guns nor armaments,
Nor the tune the bands can play,
But the close cooperation,
That makes us win the day.
It ain?t the individual,
Nor the army as a whole,
But the everlasting team work,
Of every blooming soul.
IN THE DOLDRUMS
But it was no use, we were in the doldrums, and even enthusiastic President
Dick Havyatt was pretty depressed. So much so that the following circular went
out to Council.
?The Executive Committee has deemed it advisable to call a meeting of the
Council to consider the following resolution that was carried at the last Meeting of
the Executive Committee,
'That the Executive Committee recommends that a General Meeting of the
Sydney Savage Club be called this month in lieu of the Monthly Corroboree
to consider the future policy and functioning of the Sydney Savage Club.
The Meeting will be held on October Bth, 1936, at 7.45 p.m., at Adams
Hotel, Pitt Street, in the first floor lounge?.?
This meeting was held and a lot of ?yabba,? pro and con, enthusiastic and
pessimistic, critical and adulatory, took place, the upshot being that it was decided
that an Extraordinary General Meeting of members should be held forthwith. It


' \ I

meerschaum.
was decided, no doubt tact-
fully, to have this in the form
of a dinner on Thursday,
October 22nd, at the ?Coal
Hole? Restaurant, Adams
Hotel, George Street.
The notice covering this
meeting, which exhorted every
member to her- present, ex-
plained that the Council had
met and wished the following
proposals to be placed before
this special meeting:
(a) That the Club go into
recess until the Annual
General Meeting with a
view to considering there-
at the reorganisation of
the Club.
(b) That an active drive be
made to augment the
membership with a view
to establishing permanent
Club premises.
(c) That the Club engage a
paid organiser to develop
the Club and the conduct of its Corroborees and to increase membership along
the right lines.
We were evidently not entirely broke because the cost of the dinner and up to
<�lo worth of liquor were to be borne by the Club.
All this sounds very solemn and it was obvious that either things were not
shaping too well or those responsible for the Club?s welfare had a spot of melancholia.
With many new organisations one can trace the same pattern. It starts off with
a burst of glamour. Many come forward with support, but as the months go by,
much of this turns out to be frivolous and these erstwhile enthusiasts flutter away
to taste the flavour of something else that temporarily attracts them. Thus, as usual,
the solid work devolves upon the hard core of a few keen enthusiasts. For a time
it is possible to make excuses, ?Oh, we are only young yet;? ?next year things will
improve,? and such wishful thinking. At the end of two years, however, it was
obvious that our Executive and Council felt that further progress should be made.
Nineteen thirty-four saw the country beginning to emerge from the Depression,
and by 1936 the economic outlook was brightening, so we couldn?t shelve the blame
on to economics. I think the expulsion from the Arts Club was a bitter blow, and
the uncompromising coldness of the bare Australian Hall had a numbing and
depressing effect upon our jaded faculties so that the future looked bleak indeed.
The terms of the notice calling this meeting did not mince matters, and what it
did not say could be read between the lines. Eighty members turned up. After a
good dinner, I read the relevant notice and the President spoke at some length upon
the Club and bis ideas as to how it should function, his ideals for its expansion and
his dissatisfaction at the manner in which it was at present functioning. Some hours,


many speeches, and a number of beers later, a motion proposed by Savage Bill Lewis
and seconded by Savage George Cowie was carried unanimously, that a vote of
confidence in the Executive of the Club be passed by this Meeting and that the
members submit themselves to discipline in assisting in the functioning of the Club
and hereby express their willingness to co-operate in whatever manner the Executive
desire.?
And so once again, true democracy presented a solution of self-discipline and
commonsense.
TUNG-YU PARK
At this juncture there was a diversion by Savage Ben Andrew who was prime
mover in what he grandiloquently described as the ?Second Great Moonlight Raid.
Ben Andrew was always full of ideas and enthusiasm. In private life he was an
engineer associated with the Australian Gas Light Company; he was a genial
personality and loved organising things. Earlier he had arranged a Barbecue at
Tung-Yu Park. In those days a barbecue was something new and novel. Tung-Yu
Park is situated at Kenshurst in the Dural district between Parramatta and Castle
Hill, some twenty miles from Sydney, right in the Australian bush overlooking a
wooded valley, an ideal spot for such an outing.
Ben delighted in this sort of thing and let his hair down properly in the
circular, which went forward under the dramatic heading ??Mobilisation Order. I
think, re-reading this, he must have been a Boy Scout in his youth and been an avid
leader of Fenmore Cooper and Rider Haggard with Tennyson and Chaucer thrown
in (vide final para.) for good measure. The ??Mobilisation Order? read:?
?Once again our Scouts report great activity in the stronghold of Tung-Yu
Park. Here, Savages Moorehead, Westmacott, Watson and Freeman are still reputed
to be in possession of great spoils, the results of their many well-planned raids. Our
great Ebau has therefore ordered another full tribal attack on them at their place of
rendesvous. Come, then, Braves, Warriors and Lubras and all friends of our Totem,
come gather around our Ebau once more for he would tell you of riches in these
vastnesses beyond the dreams of any simple man.
?The defenders will again be led by Savage Moorehead, mighty wielder of the
Barbecue blade, but our party will be led by the crafty Chieftain Savage Kither, and
his horde of Savages of the Singing Totem. Much attack is undoubtedly their
forte, and the tribe can in safety advance behind this leader?s baton. He is aHe ad
man.
?The Nurtunja (blazing ceremonial poles) will be secretly erected by Savages
Moody, Nilsson, and Mac Donald at Tung-Yu, and 6.30 p.m. shall be the Zero hour
Many Waninga (sacred ceremonial objects) we shall see again at the rendezvous, and
also many bunyips (fairies) in the bush. Moon-eyed Lubras will accompany us,
and once more our victory will be sure.
?In imagination, picture the smoking ruins of the Tung-Yu citadel and many
tasty sausages plucked by victorious Savages and their Lubras in the Zenith of the
conquest.
?Bring out your Nulla-nullas, Ye Savages bolde, also your Lubras? dilly bags,
and the Steaming Pot Totem shall fall.
?Know ye, stout hearts and maidens faire (yclept Savages in armour and Lubras
in war-paint) that attendant with us shall be the young Chieftain Brave Savage Fred


Hyde, him of the mighty Singing Totem, so prepare ye well for a night of gladness
to follow in the forest because we have a liking for the brave defenders of the
Barbecue and intend to reinstate them as Warriors once more of the Sydney Savage
Tribe.
?PROCLAMATION BY ORDER OF OUR EBAU
President Savage H. L. S. Havyatt.?
It was obvious that such lyrical prose could not be sullied by any mundane
reference to filthy lucre, so a separate notice made it clear that the price was 11/' per
double ticket, and the fact that the raid had been fixed for November 28th, 1936,
which is ?a night of the full moon.? He was resourceful, however, and there was
a rider to the effect that in the event of the evening being showery, the party will
be hicld in the shelter of the kiosk. This raid, he went on, is being organized by
the members of the Club Choir, and it is tendered to Savage Fred Hyde ?as a mark
of appreciation of the wonderful work he has done as conductor and organizer of
the Choir and as Honorary Accompanist at our Corroborees.?
The raid eventuated, the night was perfect, and I can well remember ?Mose?
Moorehead, as he was known, and Bill Kither (both top executives of the Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Co.) with aprons and chefs? hats carving away for dear life at
great mountains of meat. Ben, a rotund character, buzzed hither and yon sporting
a blonde wig with long tresses goodness knows why with countenance glistening
with good humour and good cheer and looking rather like Mae West on a busy night.
The Choir, I think, rendered items in the moonlight, and altogether this get'
together of the Savages and their ladies seemed to provide just the down'tO'earth
revitalizing tonic that was needed.
Ben Andrew continued to be an enthusiastic Savage for some years until in 1940
he migrated to Melbourne, where he became associated with a Club akin in some
respects to our own, known as ?The Bread and Cheese? Club, where, no doubt, his
enthusiasm has found useful outlet.
Having recovered from the influence of the Tung'Yu moonlight and the
machinations of the Moon-eyed Lubras, the Executive, stimulated by the confidence
expressed at the recent meeting, organized the Christmas Corroboree in the new
Banqueting Hall at the Hotel Australia. A tip'top dinner was arranged and Savages
could bring guests at 15/' each. Savage Joe Collins, as Chief Savage, conducted the
earlier part of the programme and then handed over the gavel to Brave Claude
Fleming, this, I think, being the first occasion when this grand chap, who was later to
become a Chief Savage, partiepated in the conduct of a Corroboree. Another feature
of the evening was the presentation of a brief case to Savage Albert Cazabon, who
was leaving the Prince Edward Theatre where he had built up and conducted for
some years a first'dass orchestra, to return to London.
I vaguely remember that at this Corroboree there was a rather disconcerting
diversion, when the large box containing all our properties, regalia, etc., was brought
forward and no one could find the key. I can recall the flurry and the frayed tempers
but not clearly the solution as to where we finally found the key or how the box was
opened. I think resourceful Savage Stage Manager Eric Gordon did the trick for
a frantic Savage Scenic Artist Phil Warner who was so disturbed by the occurrence
that he didn t, as usual, drop off to sleep, cigar in mouth, and with sonorous
accompaniment, during the latter part of the evening as he mellowed.
I do remember it was a splendid Christmas Corroboree and entirely dispelled the
gloom and pessimism which had been amongst us. Nineteen thirty'seven looked
much more hopeful.


One point that had been agreed at the ?Coal Hole? meeting was that we did
not get together enough and so it was decided to revive the Luncheons, several of
which had been held spasmodically in our early days, and these were organized once
a month at Farmers 1 Oak Room.
It was at this juncture that President Savage Dick Havyatt announced that he
would be leaving Sydney to practice his profession of law in the country. The
Third Annual Meeting was the occasion that was arranged to say farewell and to pay
tribute to his great work. For this meeting on June Ist, 1937, we again adjourned
underground to Adams? ?Coal Hole? Cafe, which we found definitely had an
atmosphere. Perhaps Savages like caves.
Some fifty Savages were present, and after fortifying themselves with a good
dinner, settled back to hear the President present a verbal annual report in which he
reviewed various aspects of the Club, stating, inter alia, that at present there were
157 financial members. He urged that a bold progressive policy should be adopted for
the future.
Honorary Treasurer Trevor Daniel presented a Balance Sheet, duplicated copies
of which, for the first time, had been carefully drawn up and sent to all members.
It showed a credit balance of �56/0/7 as at April 30th, 1937, which figure, it was
said, ?compared favourably with the financial position at the end of the previous
year.?
?CHANGING OF THE GUARD?
The feature of the evening was the ?changing of the guard?: the retiring of
President Savage Dick Havyatt, and the assuming of office of President Savage
Harold Cross. The health of Dick was formally proposed by Fred Hyde, seconded
by George Cowie with his usual flowery fluency, verbally supported by many
Savages and enthusiastically drunk by all present. Dick was made a Life Member
of the Club and presented with an inscribed mulga inkwell for his office desk and a
cheque representing the proceeds from a fund that had been organized so that all
Savages could pay tribute to his work since the foundation of the Club. It was
further decided that a suitable motion of appreciation should be drawn up under the
signature of the President and Honorary Secretary, framed, and sent to him.
Thus may be said to end the first period of the Club?s development.


SAVAGE CHRISTMAS CHEER
Drawing by joe Collins.


ONE OF THE first actions of the founders of our Club in
1934 was to send fraternal greetings to the Savage Club in
London. This was something like the action of a proud
accoucheur on the other side of the world advising a faraway
parent of the safe delivery of yet another lusty offspring of
whose conception and advent he knew naught. Surely, artificial

insemination at its highest cultural level. I?ve been unable to
trace any record of the reply to this overture but can just see our British brothers
saying ?Gad, how stunning!? But as Savages they?re a tolerant bunch and we were
not disowned, and in the years that have passed, personal contact in peace and war
has brought about a mutual regard between the Savages in the heart of the Empire
and those in this new land, based upon the ideals of Savagery that we share.
Until we acquire our permanent home it has not been possible for us to enjoy
official affiliation with the Savage Club as does the Melbourne Savage Club. We
fully appreciate this circumstance. This, however, has been no barrier to the free
intermingling of our members and many Sydney Savages have enjoyed the privilege
of visiting Carlton House Terrace following a letter of introduction from me, on
behalf of the Sydney Savages, to George Baker, the Savage Club Hon. Secretary. This
has been no one'way traffic and George does the same to me when one of his lads is
coming our way.
ORIGIN OF NAME
I?ve been asked literally hundreds of times the origin of the Club?s name by both
new members and by many of our guests. As there seems general lack of knowledge
and misunderstanding on this score I feel I should quote from Mr. Aaron Watson?s
book ?The Savage Club?? published in 1907 on the occasion of the Club?s Fiftieth
Birthday.
He says that only two of the original members have ever been known to agree
on the actual details of the Club?s beginning. One, Andrew Halliday, gives the
following account of the foundation and naming of the Club:?
?The Savage Club was founded to supply the want which Dr. Samuel Johnson
and his friends experienced when they founded the Literary Club. A little band of
authors, journalists, and artists felt the need of a place of reunion where, in the hours
of leisure, they might gather together and enjoy each other?s society, apart from the
publicity of that which was known in Johnson?s time as the ?coffee house,?? and
equally apart from the chilling splendour of the modern club. When about a dozen
of the original members were assembled in the place selected for their meetings (the
?Crown?? Tavern, Vinegar Yard, Drury Lane, over against the gallery entrance of
Drury Lane Theatre) it became a question what the Club should be called. Every
one in the room suggested a title. One said the ?Addison,? another the ?Johnson,?
a third the ?Goldsmith,? and so forth ; and at last, after we had run the whole
gamut of famous literary names of the modern period, a modest member in the corner
suggested the ?Shakespeare.? This was too much for the gravity of one of the
company (the late Robert Brough) whose keen sense of humour enabled him, in the
midst of our enthusiasm, to perceive that we were bent on making ourselves
ridiculous. ?Who are we,? he said, ?that we should take these great names in vain'.?
Don't let us be pretentious. If we must have a name, let it be a modest one one


that signifies as little as possible.? Hereupon a member called out, in a pure spirit of
wantonness, ?The Savage!? That keen sense of humour was again tickled. The
very thing!? he exclaimed. ?No one can say there is anything pretentious in
assuming that name. If we accept Richard Savage (a mediocre dramatist with a poor
reputation, who died a century before) as our godfather, it shows that there is no
pride about us. And so, in a frolicsome humour, our little society was christened
the ?Savage Club.?
The other initial member who generally concurred with the above account was
Dr. G. L. M. Strauss, who also records that it was John Deffett suggested
the alternative meaning of the name and presented the new reunion incontinently
with a choice assortment of tomahawks, boomerangs, assegais, and other weapons
of savage warfare.
George Augustus Sala also adds that ?to keep up our character of Savages, we
sedulously practised a shrill shriek or war-whoop which was given in unison at stated
intervals.?
Mr. Percy Bradshaw, a prominent Savage, in his book 'Drawn from Memory,
published in 1943, gives a similar account, also quoting the original letter of invitation
sent out by George Augustus Sala, author and journalist, to about twenty friends.
Thursday, eighth October, 1857.
Dear Sir,
The favour of your presence is requested at a meeting of
gentlemen connected with literature and the fine arts, and warmly
interested in the promotion of Christian Knowledge and the sale of
exciseable liquors, to be holden at the ?Crown? Tavern, Vinegar
Yard, Drury Lane, on Monday, the 12th instant at five o?clock,
p.m.; there and then to confer upon the expediency of forming a
social society or club, hereafter to receive a suitable designation,
and to have its habitat at the ?Crown? Tavern aforesaid.
I am, Dear Sir,
Yours very faithfully,
GEORGE AUG. SALA,
Hon. Sec. pro tern.
So there is the story of the famous word, with its various shades of meaning and
implication.
One notes that our own aboriginal character was even represented by a
boomerang, though the Savage Club badge favours the Indian Brave type of
?Savage? complete with flowing eagle feather head-dress. Around the edge of the
badge are the words, Art, Science, Drama, Music and Literature, separated by small
drawings of an inkwell and quills, a lyre, and a palette and brushes.
The first clause in the book of rules is ?The Club is instituted for the association
of gentlemen connected professionally with Literature, Art, Music, and the Drama in
their creative or interpretative aspects, or with Science through original research and
discovery.?
Our own Club?s clause, while following this closely, gives more flexibility in
membership qualifications: ?To promote social intercourse and good fellowship
amongst men interested in literature, art, music, the drama, the sciences, original
research or discovery.?


Since then the Savage Club has had a great and glorious history. Membership
is limited to 700 town and 200 country members and to be a Savage is a privilege
greatly sought after by all associated with music, the stage, literature and art.
Membership means more than artistic ability; it means that a lot of good fellows
think you, too, are a good fellow. What more could one wish?
CELEBRATION GIFT
Having announced our genesis, we followed on in the image of our inspiration
to the best of our ability, adding an Australian slant, just as in New Zealand, Maori
culture had influenced Savagery in that country.
As far as I know our first personal contact was made in 1938 when, as a gesture
connected with the 150 th Anniversary Celebrations, a boomerang was sent to the
Savage Club with Savage Frank Hutchens who was visiting London at that time.
(It had to be a boomerang, I suppose; thank goodness we didn t wish a koala on poor
old Frank). In a note headed ?The Royal College of Music, London,? Frank
subsequently wrote: ?Please tell the Club that the boomerang was presented a week
ago to the Savage Club at their important Saturday evening function and received
with the greatest enthusiasm. Albert Cazabon and I were there and we found the
gift most deeply appreciated. We felt distinctly proud to be the ambassadors to such
a famous Club from an equally fine lot of Savages in Sydney. They were interested
to hear of our Ode.? (for which Frank composed the music).
Following this event a letter went forward under the joint signatures of
President Bill Wood and myself, in these terms: ?
?The President, Chief Savage, and members of the Sydney Savage Club have
pleasure in sending warmest greetings and deepest feelings of good fellowship to
their Tig brothers? of the Savage Club. (In using this expression we hadn?t then
heard George Orwell?s T9B4?).
?The traditions and achievements of your distinguished Club, which is privileged
to function in the very heart of the Empire, is a source of pride and inspiration to
our younger and less famous organization, but we are imbued, we hope, with the
same enthusiasm and desire to make our Club equally worthy of the national heritage
which in common we share, and the great ideals of brotherhood which together we
cherish.
?With a rich and vivid background of aboriginal lore and legend, we are giving
to the Sydney Savage Club a real Australian colour, and our native salutation of
?KooramaToon,? which signifies ?Sit down, all about, brother,? reflects truly the spirit
of the Sydney Savages.? This letter went on to request a message to our Christmas
Corroboree on December 17th, 1938, which came forward and was read thereat with
pleasure and satisfaction.
As time went on we had a splendid link between our two Clubs in the person
of Harold Williams, who had belonged to the Savage Club for many years and
returned to Australia in 1940, subsequently becoming President of the Sydney Savage
Club for two years. (The London Club, incidentally, does not have a President,
Management being vested in a General Committee, comprising Honorary Secretary,
Honorary Treasurer, Honorary Solicitor, three Trustees, and twelve members, elected
annually at the Annual Meeting. Individual Chairmen are selected to conduct the
various Club functions).


THE CLUB BOMBED
In the blitz, when London was taking it, bloody but unbow?d, the Club was
badly bombed on October 15th, 1940.
Percy Bradshaw describes the scene in his book:?
?I clambered among the wreckage of our Club with George, on the morning
after the raid. Cur lovely Lounge overlooking the Mall had caught the full force
of the blast, and was a hopeless ruin of smashed furniture and pictures, wrecked walls
and gaping windows; the Library was a junk-heap of shattered bookshelves and
masonry; the Office had disappeared; all the South side of the Club was ruined.
George Baker quietly surveyed the end of more than half his dreams, and then
suggested that we should walk round to the Sports Club.
?Our Brother Savages lunched at the Sports Club that day, and used the Club
as a home-from-home while we were closed for repairs.?
The Sports Club and the Constitutional Club offered their premises to the
homeless Savages but by the herculean efforts of Secretary George Baker, his stall
and committees, the Club was livable again in two months, though it was not
completely restored till 1949 when I had the privilege of being present when it was
again officially re-opened. Of this, more anon.
We hastened to express our grief and in spite of everything that was going on,
promptly received this reply.
My Committee wish me to offer you their most sincere thanks
for your kind letter of the Ist October.
London has passed, and is still passing, through a very trying
time in its history, but the courage of its people is truly amazing.
No. 1, Carlton House Terrace, was hit by a high-explosive
bomb on October 15th in the early morning, and we were
evacuated to another Club for exactly eight weeks. lam happy
to report, however, that on Saturday last we re-opened the Club,
but with somewhat smaller premises, as several of our rooms will
remain uninhabitable until the end of the war.
The spirit of the Savage Club has survived, as it always will.
It is something that a thousand Hitlers could not break!
Yours sincerely,
GEORGE BAKER,
11th December, 1940. Hon. Secretary.
BROADCAST FROM LONDON
A few months later on April Ist, 1941, there was the famous short-wave
broadcast from London of a Savage Club Luncheon to the Melbourne Savage Club.
We held a special Corroboree on the same night and advised London by cable.
What a thrilling moment it was when at 9.30 p.m. we switched on the radio and
listened to Secretary Savage George Baker introduce the programme from the dining
room at Carlton House Terrace. He told of the setting, how priceless treasures
adorned the walls of the room, including a section of wallpaper from the old Club at
Adelphi Terrace bearing the autographs of three Kings of England George, Prince
of Wales, 1903; Edward, Prince of Wales, 1919; and Albert, 1928. (Four Kings of
England have been Honorary Members of the Savage Club).

Then followed a brief statement of the names of famous Australians seated
around the table and a message of greeting from the Savage Club to Melbourne
ravage Club and all kindred Clubs in Australia.
The musical programme opened by members and guests in London singing such
old choruses as ?Daisy Bell,? ?The Man who broke the Bank at Monte Carlo? and
Boys of the Old Brigade ? to Savage Joe Batten?s accompaniment. Reception was
so good that members and guests of the Sydney Savage Club joined in, thus though
1 ?TOGO miles apart, both Clubs sang under the leadership of one man.
The musical programme from London included Savages the Weston Brothers,
Norman Allin, Mark Hambourg, Benno Moiseiwitsch, and our own Australian'
Malcolm McEachern, who sang The King is still in London the same as Mr. Jones.?
It might appropriately have been said, The Savages are still in London also, despite
the fact that the fiercest air raid of the war had been launched during the previous
night.
Savages, mark you, all this was taking place in the midst of the blitz, when a
great city was being cruelly and unmercifully pounded by bombing as never before
in history. When a Savage left the luncheon, if he hadn?t copped one over coffee,
he might return to find that his office wasn?t there any more, or worse still, on going
home, find his house a heap of rubble and his loved ones maimed or dead. What a
people!

Perhaps the piece de resistance of the broadcast was the following verse by
Savage Reginald Arkell: ?
SALUTE TO AUSTRALIA
?How well we know, Australia will be there?
By Reginald Arkell
When there is any fun toward,
Or devilment to share,
We know, ye gods, how well we know,
Australia will be there.
We?ve met you on the cricket field,
And in our Savage bar,
We know, ye gods, how well we know,
What splendid chaps you are.
We?ve heard you sing your funny songs,
Across the desert sands,
Though who or what Matilda is,
We cannot understand.
Digger, the time has come again,
When all must do and dare,
We know, ye gods, how well we know,
Australia will be there.
Harold Williams, recently back from England, was with us that night and was
visibly touched when George Baker said: ?Now, Harold Williams is at this very
moment a guest of the Savage Club in Sydney, and to him and to them we give our
very heartiest greetings.? His emotion, however, did not affect his splendid voice as
he sang for us afterwards. It was indeed a memorable night; even the static forbore
to interfere.
We immediately wrote and expressed our appreciation and George in his reply
said:
?A thousand thanks to you for your charming and most encouraging letter of
the 22nd April. If you liked our broadcast and there does not seem to be much
doubt about it then we are amply repaid for any trouble that we took.
?These fraternal links with the Empire are always valuable and more particularly
at the present moment when we are so deeply indebted to all our Australian brethren.
I sincerely hope that you will be able to arrange a broadcast to the Home Country
at some time in the near future. Such an event would be most exciting to everyone
in this Club.?
The final paragraph referred to our letter in which we said we would see if a
return broadcast could be arranged. We tried very hard to turn this idea into
reality. Savage Jim Donnelly of the A.B.C. went into it and a short-wave broadcast
of our 1941 Christmas Corroboree was proposed. Problems, however, intervened


and then we tried H. G. Jack Horner of 2GB with a proposal to record the
programme and send this over, hut we failed to achieve our purpose, much to our
regret. If London in the midst of the blitz could broadcast such an item why the
devil couldn t we. It remains a challenge for the future.
In 1949 I had the pleasure of visiting the Savage Club for the first time and
presenting an Honour Plaque on behalf of the Sydney Savages. This is recounted
later (Chapter XVIII). In 1950 Honorary Treasurer Trevor Daniel visited his native
Wales and whilst in London went along to the Club with Harold Williams, thus
being the second of the Club?s office-bearers to make a pilgrimage to the home of
Savagery. He leaves again at the end of this year and has undertaken to hand copies
ol this volume to some of our overseas members, such as Stanley Clarkson, John
Probyn and Wilfrid Thomas. Over the years many other Savages such as Ollie Oberg,
Fred Newson, Roy Nilsson, Ellis Troughton, Ken Hall, Ken Coles, John Russon, Don
Gunn and others have carried on the good work as ambassadors from ?down under.?
The most recent was Frank Crane who, with the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Alderman
P. D. Hills, paid a courtesy call to the Club and were most graciously received. He
took with him some of our Club scarves as a small gift for George Baker and his
executive colleagues.
Every Christmas we exchange fraternal greetings by cable and so, as the years
go by, the silken threads that bind Savages on both sides of the globe together are
more firmly knit.

HAROLD CROSS, our new President, was what may be
described as a live wire. He was in the real estate business and
had his offices in the lower ground floor of the E.S. A. Bank
Building, at the corner of Martin Place and Pitt Street which
is now occupied by L. J. Hooker Ltd. He was brisk, brusque
and dark haired, quick in his actions, a good organizer and

vivid personality. I well remember at Council Meetings, when
a motion was proposed and received approval, he never said ?carried,? in the usual
way, but would always rap the table with one staccato word ?sold,? his professional
instinct thus manifesting itself.
THE PICKWICK CLUB
We had good material at the helm, with Savage Harold Cross as President, Jim
Brunton Gibb as Chief Savage, Savages Joe Collins, Claude Flemming, Harry Hill
and Bill Kither, as Vice Presidents, and Bill Lewis, Fred Hyde, Alfred Hill, and John
O?Donnell as Braves.
First problem of the new regime was to find a congenial meeting place, for since
the Australian Hall interlude we had only held stop-gap meetings at the ?Coal Hole,??
and the Christmas Corroboree at the Hotel Australia, so we still had no real home.
HAROLD CROSS
President 1937-38. Harold died in
1938 at the early age of 43.
There was much rushing around and finally
it was decided to hold the first Corroboree in
our fourth year at the Pickwick Club, a
former book Club which had recently occupied
spacious premises in the lower ground floor of
the new City Mutual Building on the corner
of Hunter and Bligh Streets.
First Corroboree at the Pickwick Club
was in June, 1937. The programme included
Wilson Ewart, basso; Clement Q. Williams,
tenor; Richard Diedrich, songs at the piano;
Frank Ryan ?that inimitable impressionist of
the inebriate; Athos Martelli, ?cellist; Jim
Russell, sketch artist; Savage Lionel Bibby and
Jimmie, marksmen and the Savage Club Choir
with Brave Fred Hyde.
The Pickwick Club was a success. It was
comfortable and the management, under
Miss Dorise Hill, helpful and co-operative.
There were a few troubles of visibility and
acoustics in regard to the massive columns
supporting the vast building above, but there
was also an atmosphere, so we decided to
make this our headquarters henceforth, and
Luncheons, which had been held at Farmers?
Oak Room, were also transferred to the
Pickwick. So our twin pillars of Savagery


?Corroborees on the fourth Friday and Luncheons on the first Wednesday of the
month?commenced, and with the exception of the few years when we were unable
to secure continuous reservations for Friday night, so it has continued.
With the notice advising of these new arrangements the following paragraph
appeared: ?So that we may know all our brother Savages by their Christian names
the Executive has decided to issue a new series of Club Badges which will, in addition
to the surname of the Savage, carry the Christian or nickname by which he is best
known to his pals.? The nickname angle caused a good deal of mirth, Savages asking
each other how many b?s there were in certain terms of Australian endearment.
THE ST. JAMES ORCHESTRA
The July Corroboree followed with once again a tip-top programme: the Vaga-
bond male quartet; Savage Lloyd Davies, violinist; George Brown, entertainer; Stanley
Clarkson, basso; Savage Alex Sverjensky, pianist; Arthur Prince, illusionist; Paul
Kain, tenor; Savage Harry Roberts with a wrestling display; the Savage Club Choir
under Brave Fred Hyde, and the piece de resistance, Savage Lloyd Davies and the
full Orchestra that he conducted at the St. James Theatre.
I can remember the feeling of anticipation and excitement, as the members of
this Orchestra entered the Pickwick Club on the first occasion, after they had completed
their own show. As they came in one by one with their instruments, great and small,
and started tuning up in the inimitable fashion of the orchestras in the old days, we
were all full of enthusiasm, and when at the first sweep of Lloyd?s baton, the full
volume of their music filled the Pickwick, it was a grand experience. It remains the
one and only time that we have had a complete orchestra with us. We made them
all Honorary Members and they were with us at a number of Corroborees until Lloyd
Davies left Sydney to take up an appointment as Professor of the Violin at the Elder
Conservatorium in Adelaide, with which he is still associated. Going through my
records I came across this list from Lloyd from which to have badges made: Edward
Cockman, Leader; Schirmer Podinowsky, violin; James Hickey, violin; George Martelli,
?cello; Frank Hammond, bass; Robert Irwin, flute; Louis Rivolli, clarinet; Fred
Charlesworth, trumpet; Leonard Jones, trombone; Walter Scott, drums; and Keith
Holt, piano.
With the departure of their leader, the Savage Club-St. James? Orchestra
gradually faded away, much, I believe, to our mutual regret.
LUBRAS AFLOAT
The next activity of note was the Third Annual Ladies? Night on August 26th,
1937, which on this occasion, for the first and only time, was held on the waters of
Sydney Harbour on what was then the Sydney Ferries? new Showboat ?Kalang?
which, after seeing war service in New Guinea waters, still each week shows
thousands the beauties of our Harbour.
Council gave a good deal of thought to this nautical venture, thoroughly
inspecting the vessel and having luncheon aboard with Captain Flockhart before
making a decision. Their judgment, however, proved sound and the novelty appealed
to Savages who came along in large numbers with their ladies and friends. Showboat,
resplendent in her bright new paint and ablaze with light, was moored at No. 8
Circular Quay from 8.15 to 8.45 p.m., when she cast off and cruised round the
Harbour in the moonlight, returning for stragglers at 11 o?clock, the night finally
terminating at 1 p.m. For the benefit of the Northern-siders, a call was made at
Cremorne Wharf on the way back at about 12.30. Dick Havyatt sent a telegram of
warning from Glen Innes: ?Watch out for mermaid lubras tonight. They pull you
down.?


A Corroboree programme was held on the upper deck during the earlier part
of the evening followed later on by dancing to the Weeamera Orchestra. Chief
Savage Brunton Gibb and his wife Ethel gave some short sketches. Savage Clement
Williams, accompanied by Enid Conley, presented several charming little aboriginal
songs. The Vagabond Male Quartette Savages Stanley Clarkson, Paul Kain,
Terry Hunt and Albert Miller delighted us with their robust harmony. Savage
Frank Stuart and the Sydney Swords Club, which he directed, gave a flamboyant
display of fencing and swordsmanship, while the Savage Club Choir and an
instrumental trio under the baton of Fred Hyde completed a fine programme.
Clem Williams? aboriginal songs were quite a hit and we tried to learn some
of them at subsequent Corroborees. I?m afraid our aboriginal accent, in spite of
cutting our teeth on Koora-na-boon, was rather woeful, but we tried hard. Here are
a couple of them:
BANGEE RANG AN-AN-AH
(A Hunting Song)
Bangee Rang an-an-Ah, Dthi-blurrah.
Join the hunt to'day come away.
Bangee Rang an-an-Ah, Dthi-blurrah.

Bangee Rang an-an-Ah,
Join the hunt to'day.
Willy nurry no,

Urmunday wo-wo-wo,
Bring along, Join the throng ,
Injiaco mookooloo
Resting none till the sun
Dthoo-roo woohoo nin.

(sung for both verses).
BINGO-BINGO
(A warning against bathing in a water-hole inhabited by a Bunyip)
Bingo-bingo carmoo curree,
This shadow'd pool, so dar\, so deep,
Bingo-bingo carmoo curree,
The ban\s to slippery, so steep;
Bingo-bingo carmoo curree,
Whut hidden monsters in it creep;
Bingo-bingo carmoo curree,
The slimy weeds your limbs ensnare,
Cowal, cowal, cowal, cowal,
To drag you to the Bunyip's lair.
Bingo-bingo carmoo curree.
The Bunyip?s lair, Beware! Beware!
No one suffered from and as the happy Savages left the wharf there
was much sonorous ?blowing the man down,? putting drunken sailors into long
boats,? aye, aye-ing, and other nautical nonsense.


CHRISTMAS PRESENTS
Christmas Dinner and Corroboree was held at the Pickwick on December
17th, 7, and in conjunction with it a rather happy gesture was made. All
Savages as a Christmas gesture worthy of the Savage Club 1 ? were requested to bring
to the Corroboree a child?s gift or toy (not to cost more than 2/6 d.) which would
~ �i y en to poor children under the direction of Savage Missionary George Cowie
m his Surry Hills parish.
George Cowie was delighted with the response and handled the distribution with
great energy and efficiency and, with a letter of thanks that he wrote, appended a
complete list of the children with their addresses in Surry Hills, Paddington and
Darlington to whom, with his energetic wife, he had spent the whole day delivering
the toys to parents so that they could be placed in the kiddies? stockings on Christmas
morning.
Some Savages who had overlooked bringing their toys donated a few shillings
and George in his letter said that he discussed with his wife what they should do
with the money. She, ?knowing the conditions of the children very well,? considered
that it would be an excellent idea to give some of them a pair of sandshoes which are
very handy during the summer holidays; these were purchased at 3/' a pair (mark
you.). I can assure my brother Savages,? said George, ?that their action has meant
much to us in our work here and has brought a great deal of comfort, joy and
appmess to many parents and their children during the Christmas season 1937 a
Christmas which, I am sure, the children will never forget.?
This pleasant custom was repeated for several years but I regret to say has not
cen revived after the continuity was broken in 1943 when toys were practically
unprocurable under wartime restrictions. Perhaps it could be said that in these days
o prosperity t e need is not so great; nevertheless, the underlying thought of afving
? an receivm g is one to which we as a Club could, I think, again direct our

hac their effect and so, by popular vote, it was decided not to wear dinner-jackets at
future Corroborees. This decision would have given great satisfaction to Wee

150 TH ANNIVERSARY CORROBOREE
The year 1938 was an important one for Australia for it recorded the fact that
it was but 150 short years since Captain Arthur Phillip had landed with the First
Fleet in Sydney Cove on, as every Australian schoolboy knows, January 26th, 1788
Celebrations were held throughout the Nation and the Savage Club felt that it should
play its part and so a special Corroboree was organized on Friday, February 2 sth
*9-??B a period in which we are usually in recess at Grace Bros. Auditorium!
the function being listed in the official programme of events.
The Minister in charge of the celebrations was the Hon. J. M. Dunningham,
tate Minister for Labour and Industry. Jack Dunningham was a popular figure and
did a splendid job in the organizing and carrying through of thes-e Celebrations.
Unfortunately he died soon afterwards and it was thought that the great effort that
he put into this task could well have contributed to his premature death. The
organizing secretary was Mr. D. G. MacDougall and both of these gentlemen
honoured us with their presence.
The Club was allotted two 150 th Anniversary Medals, which were struck with
the names of the President and Chief Savage, as official recognition of our efforts.
Joe Collins produced a Souvenir programme which depicted on the cover ?
grinning abo. wearing an old style naval cocked hat sideways; inside, under the
aboriginal words ?Crana?Mudgee?Ettamogah!? (Welcome, come sit down, have
a drink) was this omnibus toast interspersed with appropriate line sketches:

Reference will be noted to Alfred Hill?s three new odes, which were entitled.
?The President?s Song,? ?The Chief Savage Song,? and ?The Song of the Braves,?
which Alf had specially composed with words by versatile Joe Collins. I can recall
at one of our weekly Council Meetings at the Exchange Hotel, Alf, beaming
with the after-glow of musical birth, with Fred Hyde at the piano, giving


an impromptu rendition of these new compositions with great vigour, though I
doubt if he would have achieved his present eminence in the world of music had he
reversed his vocal skill for his composing talent. It was most appropriate they should
have been presented at this 150 th Anniversary Corroboree, and in a letter on behalf
of the Council expressing our thanks, I said ?our Club is particularly fortunate to
have a composer of world renown like yourself as a member and what is more, an
active member in contributing towards the tradition and culture of the Club. It is
Savages such as your good'self who make the Club what we would all have it ?a
centre of art, culture and good fellowship.?
Here are the words of two of the Odes:
THE CHIEF SAVAGE SONG
1. When the Chief, in his warpaint, is prancing around,
He is right on the spot, and can always be found,
And if troubles arise would he faint at the sound?
No he?d fight to the end like a savage.
Fight, fight, fight like a savage
Fight, fight, fight like a savage
Fight, fight, fight like a savage
A savage of olden time.
Chorus:
Fight, fight, fight like a savage
Fight, fight, fight like a savage
Fight, fight, fight like a savage
A savage of olden time.
2. When the drink, it goes in, and the senses go out,
Would he rave in despair, with a club and a clout?
No, the Chief stands a lot and to-morrow he?ll flout ?
He can swig plenty beer like a savage.
Swig, swig, swig like a savage
Swig, swig, swig like a savage
Swig, swig, swig like a savage
A savage of olden time.
Chorus:
Swig, swig, swig like a savage
Swig, swig, swig like a savage
Swig, swig, swig like a savage
A savage of olden time.
3. There are some who will say that it?s only play fight.
And think that he?s not, in the head, quite right,
If he heard a war whoop, would he die of the fright?
No he?d stand to his ground like a savage.
Stand, stand, stand like a savage
Stand, stand, stand like a savage
Stand, stand, stand like a savage
A savage of olden time.

SONG OF THE BRAVES
I. In savage lands there are always bands of Braves that are strong and hearty.
They have carved their names as Braves of charm and they cheer up any party
With quip and song they can?t go wrong, we?ll say they know their onions,
And for work or fight they are quite alright, and of Yarns they have then
funnions,
And of Yarns, they have their funnions.
Chorus:
So join the chorus strong of the Braves, both short and long.
With swelling breast they do their best to send the cheer along.
To send the cheer along.
JIM BANCKS.

2. With right good cheer
and with draughts of
beer and drinks that
are much more fearful
They play their part in
the world of Art and
they try to make life
cheerful.
They sing a song to
send along a note
that?s truly savage
And it seems the thing
that they should sing,
so that gloom we all
may ravage,
So that gloom we all
may ravage.
Chorus:
So join the chorus of the
Braves, both short
and long.
With swelling breast
they do their best to
send the cheer along.
To send the cheer along.

THE FOURTH ANNUAL MEETING was held on June 17th,
1938, at the Hotel Metropole we certainly seemed to do a bit
of pub-crawling in those days. Harold Cross had proved a
worthy and energetic successor to our first President, but in
spite of our importuning he declined to stand for a further
term; the reason for this action, though we were not aware of
it at the time, was tragically revealed in a few months.
CHAPTER VI
SHADOW AND SUNSHINE
Our third I resident was Dr. William Wood who in every way was an out-
standing personality and has been a fine Savage ever since. A man of great natural
kindliness and consideration and a lover of good, clean fun, he nevertheless had the
seiious streak of responsibility that has made the Scot a leader in so many walks of
life throughout the world.
He felt that the Club should have a more definite purpose than that of self-
enjoyment, which perhaps was a little too much to the fore in the minds of some and
consequently he instituted a series of short presidential addresses at the opening of
our Corroborees in which he spoke with sincerity, leavened with humour, on
important aspects of human endeavour. Bill gave dignity and humanity to the
Presidency and the Club progressed under his guidance till, with the advent of the

President 1938-41.
war, he relinquished office in his third term to,
as Lieutenant-Colonel Wood, take up the
more vital and urgent task of inaugurating and
directing the huge new 113 th Australian
General Hospital at Concord, Sydney, a
position which he filled with distinction and
such self-sacrifice and devotion to duty as to
seriously undermine his health. Bill Wood?s
watchword has ever been service to others,
and his fellow Savages revere and respect him
for his many practical demonstrations of this
creed. The great work that he has carried out
for so many years as Chairman of the Board
of Honorary Directors of the splendid War
Veterans? Home at Narraheen is eloquent
testimony of this fact.
Chief Savage Jim Brunton Gibb carried
on; Vice-Presidents elected were Harold Cross,
Joe Collins, Claude Flemming and Bill Kither,
with Bill Lewis, Fred Hyde, Alfred Hill, and
John O?Donnell as Braves, and so the Club
was off on its Fifth Year with a fine skipper
and a worthy ream.

THE WHEEL THAT SLIPPED
Corroborees and Luncheons followed along regularly at the Pickwick and a
policy of stimulation and development was under way. At this period nearly every
Corroboree programme included some sporting event in which a leading personality
participated, these being arranged by Savage George Wilson, who had extensive
connections in the world of sport. Thus on one occasion Fred Henneberry and
Sammy Stein, well-known boxers, came along and gave an exhibition of what was
described as the manly, or savage art.? ?It is understood,? continued the notice,?
that the Club will be represented by Savages Bill Lewis and John O?Donnell, our
heavyweights, with Joe Collins as bantamweight. However, as we now have a
medical man in the Chair there is no cause for undue anxiety.? On another night
Cus Lesnevich, light heavyweight from the United States, who was in Australia to
meet Ron Richards, was with us and gave an exhibition of training. Savage Harry
Roberts, who conducted a physical culture establishment, also used to put on wrestling
displays.
We however, stick to the exponents of the pugilistic art, and at the
September Corroboree, through the courtesy of Claude Spencer, Secretary of the
League of Wheelmen, we had leading cyclists Sid Cozens and Bennie Claire of
England and Lennie Rogers and Ernie Greig of Australia, who staged a unique test
race on the ?rollerina? (bicycle rollers) which, said the notice, ?should prove a
thrilling spectacle. As a matter of fact it proved a bit too thrilling, for Sid Cozens
gOi going so fast that his machine slipped off the rollers and he fell and badly gashed
his calf. Bill wood rushed and got his little black bag and fixed him up, and
subsequently, with his usual kindness, continued to attend him until he was
completely recovered. The Savages were upset at this incident and immediately the
hat went round and subsequently the sum of �3l (equal to well over �lOO to-day)
was handed to the injured cyclist.

A TRAGIC PERIOD
In most of our lives and in the affairs of men there appear to be certain periods
when the frailty and uncertainty of our day to day existence is borne home to us
with startling frankness and suddenness.
I mentioned that Harold Cross had refrained from standing again for the
from n � bad gone t0 tbe Blue Mountains for a rest and I received a note
~ . , Katoomba, Sunday.
Dear Adrian,
Spending a few days in the mountains to set up the old
ticker which has been bumping a bit lately, so please tender
my apologies for absence at to-morrow?s Council meeting.
The next day (as 1 received his letter) he was found dead in his bed having
passed away during his sleep from an affection of the heart from which it was
revealed he had suffered for some years. We were all stunned and grief-stricken
He was hut 4a years old and left a wife and two children.
The funeral was held at the Fullerton Memorial Presbyterian Church where
Savage George Cowie, a great friend, conducted the service and delivered the
panegyric with great eloquence and sincerity. The Church was packed, a very
arge proportion being Savages, ajnd I can remember now the sorrow in our hearts

at sometimes affects one on such emotional occasions as impressionable George
personally addressed Harold as if he were still with us.
Several months later a Committee under the chairmanship of George Cowie and
embracing Harold s many interests, formed the ?Harold Cross Memorial Committee?

his rather lonely closing years. Many Savages bade him farewell at the graveside.

My theme was even further impressed upon me as I was going through this
sad file when I came across a ?Return Thanks? card from Mrs. Marguerite Hides,
whose husband, Mr. Jack Hides, full of splendid youthful health and vigour, had
spoken to us only two months previously on his adventurous exploits in New Guinea.
Pneumonia had surreptitiously stolen the life against which the wiles of the fierce
head-hunters and the rigours of the tropical jungle had miserably failed.
After this wave of sadness things settled down again as they always must.
Running through the records of this period I found several items of interest.
In September 1938 a certain Sergeant George Smith was elected to membership.
He was a striking figure, tall, thin, tough and straight as the proverbial ramrod,
with a humorous gleam in his eye and a Scottish burr on his tongue. To-day
Superintendent George Smith is Deputy Commissioner of the N.S.W. Police Force.
Over the years George has been a popular and enthusiastic Savage and although
with his increasing responsibilities we don?t see him at the Club as much as formerly,
he s usually on deck on Sports Night and Ladies? Night and certainly never misses
a Christmas Corroboree. We like this for we can thank him for arranging for the
splendid N.S.W. Police Pipe Band to be with us to pipe in the Governor, who has
honoured us with his presence for the past seven years. The piper in his colourful
regalia striding along, kilt and sporan a?swinging, drums rattling and booming, is a
spectacle that never fails to set the blood racing in every heart, Scot or heathen.
It is perhaps the one remaining example of the -erstwhile colourful male dominating
the scene. Vive the Piper!
In another Corroboree programme I noticed a Comedy Sketch produced by Jim
Brunton Gibb with Savages Jim Kirby, Keith Gunn and Mick Flannery taking parr.
To-day Jim Kirby is one of Australia?s leading industrialists after a meteoric career
of achievement. Not looking a day older, his upright figure and jovial visage is still
often seen at our Corroborees, when not globe-flying, for Jim is still as hard a player
as he is a worker. Jim, Norman Barrell and Norman Rydge and one or two others
used to be as jolly and hilarious in their little coterie at Corroborees as Savage
medicos Derby Loudon and John Behsano, though Derby s boisterous and infectious
laugh usually hit the jackpot for the loudest burst.

JIM KIRBY
Speaking of hilarity reminds me of the play that the Sydney University Union
Dramatic Society were good enough to put on for us. It was called ?Snow White
and the Seven Little Dwarfs" (presumably with apologies to Walt Disney) and was
originally written and produced for University ?Commem." The occasion of its
creation gives some indication of its ?interesting" character, ran my notice. We had
the complete unexpurgated edition and, full of wit and satire, it was a scream.
The Brunton Gibb players in May 1938 also presented a play entitled ?Angels
of War, Jim and his wife, Ethel, generously donating the whole of the proceeds
from the performance, held at St. James? Hall, towards the Sydney Savage Club
Building Fund, which recently had been inaugurated. Jim also wrote a verse
entitled ?Koora-na-boon," autographed copies of which were sold at a bob each
towards the same fund, and as a result of these efforts �4O was raised.
Here is the verse:
KOORA-NA-BOON
By James Brunton Gibb
Before the ?white stranger" set foot on our shore,
To quell us by conquest and bind us by law,
Round camp-fire we heard the long breakers? low croon,
As we greeted our kinsmen with ?Koora-na-boon!"
The wonder of bushland, the parakeets? cry,
The murmer of gums and the ?Cross" in the sky:
The cicadas? shrill paean throughout the hot noon
As we sheltered in cave and sang ?Koora-na-boon!"
The boomerang speeding, the wild ducks? last call,
The hurling of spear and the kangaroos? fall,
Made lubras? eyes glisten and match with the moon,
As she squatted with tribesmen in ?Koora-na-boon!?
And when the ?Great Chief" beckons each of us home,
And no more from camp-fire or gunyah we roam,
May our brothers await us across the lagoon,
To greet us with ?Crana? and ?Koora-na-boon!"


Savage Joe Moss had some months previously given us a pianola, which Jim
Brunton Gibb had stored for us in his studio. We decided to put it into good
working order, but expert inspection revealed that making good the depredations of
moths and other senile ills would cost �22, so we decided, with Joe?s permission, to
sell it and devote the proceeds to the Building Fund. We received <�2B, so apparently
we made a wise decision.
SEARCH FOR PREMISES
Ever since the early days of the Club it had been our desire to obtain premises
and at this period several earnest efforts were made, negotiations taking place with
the N.S.W. Cricket Association and the N.S.W. Leagues? Club, both of which were
erecting new buildings, with the object of securing space. Unfortunately it was not
possible to achieve this and with the advent of war our efforts ceased until 1944
when they were again revived. In October of that year a letter went forth to all
Savages under the signature of President Fiarold Williams, who pointed out that
the Club was now ten years old and solicited their support for the proposal. ?The
Savage Club, I am sure, can occupy a unique position in the City of Sydney, which
is sadly lacking in any centre where men, to whom the arts and cultural pursuits are
important, may meet and enjoy the company and interchange of views with their
fellows.?? He appealed for support to the extent of �lO,OOO. The letter was
accompanied by a circular requesting that members state whether they were for or
against the proposal and, further, how many debentures of �25 were they prepared
to take up. Actual support to the extent of some �4,000 to �5,000 was forthcoming
with a probability of further finance for a specific project.
This time it really looked as if we were going to achieve success for the Building
Committee comprising Savages Harold Williams, Brunton Gibb, George Wilson,
Joe Collins, Bill Lewis and myself were very keen on a compact little building in
Macquarie a charming part of Sydney, which would have suited us splendidly,
for on the ground floor there was a largish hall that was being used by Madam
Kirsova for her ballet class and would seat some 150, which could have doubled for
both Corroborees and for Club purposes during the week; other facilities would have
been possible on the upper floors. Unfortunately, while we had been investigating
our financial resources, it was snapped up and we missed out by a matter
The successful purchasers were the St. John Ambulance Association and the price'
I understand, was something in the vicinty of �24,000. Their gam was our loss.
r, ~,I n } 946 made inquiries about the rather attractive old stone building in
1 hilhp Street, that was occupied by the Australasian Pioneers? Club, which was
moving next door to larger premises. It was owned by St. James? Church and we
were informed in a letter from the Vestry that as soon as vacated it would be used
for Church purposes. There was apparently a change of plans for it is now occupied
by a section of the Crown Solicitors? Department. It was a building with a character,
splendidly located, which would have suited us well, though we should have lacked
a large hall.
Since then a number of premises have been inspected with a view to either
purchase or rental of a section but in a city which has been so space hungry in the
postwar years it has been virtually impossible to come upon anything"" that was
either suitable or within our financial reach, some of the figures asked for even access
to leaseless floors making our modest resources look very sick indeed.

Ultimately we hope to have
something in the nature of our
own home. In the interim,
however, we are not sitting
down and pining, for, as it will
be well realised from reading
these pages, we manage to
have quite a good time and
achieve much of our desired
objectives under our present
nomadic set-up. We are con-
scious, however, of its limita-
tions, but the step from our
present voluntary organisation
to a paid staff with awards and
union hours is a big one.
Nevertheless, against that day
we continue to augment our
Building Lund as much as pos-
sible. We envy the Melbourne
Savage their delightful Club in
Bank Place, which has just the
right location and character.
The next major activity was
the Annual Ladies? Night,
always a feature of the Savage
year, and this time we swal-
lowed the anchor and held it
at the Grace Auditorium. Lor
the souvenir programme we
once again turned to inexhaus-
tible Joe Collins: what a will-
ing horse he was!
BILL LEWIS? YABBA
The cover showed an eager aboriginal with huge feet and a feather in his
head-band, dragging a shy little lubra in a short spotted dress with downcast eyes
and sucking her finger, towards this joyful event. Alongside, under the heading
of L'lnvite, ran the following:
?You cum alonga me,? said the amorous abo. cub,
?We makum plenty love alonga ti-tree scrub,
? ?Longside sandy beach down at Maroubra.?
?No plurry fear,? said she, ?you gettum back to pub;
?Me gottum invitation from Sydney Savage Club,
?Me going to be Moon-Eyed Lubra.?
I really don?t think it?s overdoing it to quote this programme too, for, with its
?yabha? by Bill Lewis, it is one of the best and, as Ladies' Nights were to be suspended
for the war years, the last of this type that we were to see.

GEORGE AND BERT
i , T hc reference t0 George Brown and Bert Harrow in the Programme brings
back happy memories for, as Bill says, they were ?dam? pfunny pfellers.? They were
on many of our programmes over the years, versatile George at the piano and singing
m his robust style, and Bert who made up for his rather piping voice with his
inimitable comedy and rubber face. They were universal favourites and when Bert
died a few years later many whom he?d made happy with his fun were very sad.
eorge alone is still around singing and caressing the notes as only he can do,
but he still looks as if he misses his old pal, for it was one of those partnerships.
Another name on this ?bill? that stirs up memories is Savage Alf Wilmore who
in Bill s words again, smgum much love song.? Alf?s been singing love songs to us
ever since and we never get tired of hearing ?Mary,? ?Sylvia,? ?Bonnie Mary? and
other favourites, or when he s really wound up, perhaps, ?Lord Randal, My Son.?
A v one can readily imagine he s always a favourite on Ladies? Night.
The 1938 Christmas Corroboree was a memorable one and was held in the
splendid new Banqueting Hall at the Hotel Australia, a feature being the readme
of a message from the Savage Club in London. It was appropriate that a London

periodic competition, and over the years a number of golf competitions have been
held, Norman Barrell usually being the willing enthusiast who has organized and
run them. Latterly George Christie has organized some bowls for the young chaps.
THE CUNYAH
It was during this year that we started a mystic institution known as the
?Gunyah.? It was felt that as quite a number of the Savages stayed in town on
Corroboree nights and so had time on their hands, in case they should get into trouble
we should provide some for them on the spot. So the gunyah was started from 7.45
to 8.15 p.m., and by dropping two bob into the gaping mouth of a large darkie?s
head one could enter the sacred portal and for this princely amount have two drinks.
I always associate old Jimmy Meynink known as Jimmy Minetinkit with the
gunyah, for he looked after the collection for many years, and woe-betide the
thoughtless and thirsty who had one over the two without coughing up again. Jimmy
was a grand Savage and with his absolutely bald brown pate and prominent conk
was a real personality. With great respect and in the spirit of Savagery, may I say
that he always reminded me of a welhfed Punch, hearty and boisterous, except when
downcast by lack of rain or a bushfire on his Moree property. He loved the Club and
found great happiness all the years of his membership which only terminated when
he was called to an even greater Corroboree. No doubt he?s checking up on possible
celestial gate-crashers still. Good old Jimmy Minetinkit.
The gunyah continued for some years and was only discontinued when liquor
became so scarce and expensive during the war. It had the virtue of commingling
Savages and guests before the Corroboree and eliminating the initial ?warming-up?
period. In other words they beat the gun by a couple of rounds.
On the debit side was the difficulty of dragging some from Gunyah to Corroboree,
and perhaps the increase in tongue tempo that sometimes caused the Chief Savage
to bang his gong almost to destruction. One of these days the gunyah may blossom
again.

THE PICKWICK CLUB had suited us very well when we
came there in 1936. The Club, however, had been growing and
it was found that the rather confined space and the difficulty of
all seeing well, owing to the too numerous and large columns,
and the rather poor accoustics for musical items, made in
necessary for us to look around for larger premises. This was
far from easy, but finally, after inspecting a number of locations,
CHAPTER VII
ON THE MOVE AGAIN
we decided that the Coronet Restaurant at 321 George Street would serve our
purpose, and our first meeting in the new location was the Fifth Annual General
Meeting held on sth May, 1939.
The Coronet was, and still is, located on the first floor of an old stone three'
storey building with shops at street level, near Wynyard Station. By the removal of
the dividing walls, the first floor had been thrown into one quite respectable area
with the entrance stairway emerging about the centre and the kitchens at the rear.
It was tastefully furnished with a soft pink albover carpet and blonde furniture, tfm
atmosphere being quiet and comfortable. The second floor was of a similar area and
it was here that we had our Corroborees, adjourning down to the first floor, after
restaurant hours were over, for our supper.
The proprietor of the Coronet was Anatol Ivanoff, a Russian a white one -
who was wont to tell us of his prowess in the air force in World War I. He was
nothing like the traditional Russian to look at, being fair and pinkish and the only
sign of facial adornment was a small moustache. He was anxious to please, fond of
music and good fellowship and when in due time he expressed a desire to join the
Club, he was admitted. He was popular with the Savages both as mine host and as a
genial companion who liked nothing better than to have little parties in the small
hours after the Corroborees had finished and lace his already happy colleagues with
?wodka,? caviar and other national delicacies.
AnatoFs early associations had apparently made him very fond of airmen and at
nearly every Corroboree he had a number of these cheery chaps around him. I also
recall a colourful character by the name of Burkowski, Polish Captain of an American
Liberty ship who used to come along whenever in port. He was, I think, an old
friend of Ivanoffs and his deep, throaty voice became more and more exuberant as
the evening wore on, the "Midnight Club? went into session and the vodka took
over. That he enjoyed the Club is obvious from this letter that I received.

Hon. Secretary of
The "Sydney Savage Club ? in Sydney.
Very Dear Sir,
I thank you for your very kind letter which was sent to
me through Mr. A. Ivanoff?s address of 30th September, 1943.
I wish to express to you my best thanks for those nice words
and invitation in future when again the Good Lord will allow
me to be in Australia to pay you and all of your Honorable
Brothers a visit to this most exceedingly nice organisation
the ?Savage Club 11
The 11th November is soon in approach and the
Armistice day is at the doors, so I do send you my best
wishes with your words in ?Opening Ode?
?Now let the philistine depart,
And in his darkness perish,
For we are met with single heart,
To praise the things we cherish . . .?
I have from here also a little present for your Club which
I will bring to you again over thousands of miles of S. Pacific.
My best respects to President George Wilson and all
others, also to yourself.
I remain. Very Dear Sir, wishing you all happiness and
good health and business. God bless you all, I remain
Very sincerely yours,
E. BURKOWSKI,
Captam, Master Mariner of Seven Seas.
In due course he turned up and presented the Club with the Samoan Tapir
Cloth that adornes the top table at each Corroboree.
We were at the Coronet throughout the war years and in spite of the national
and personal stress, they were happy years and many feel that we captured the
Savage atmosphere in this gunyah better than we have before or since, with the
exception of the first two years at the Arts Club, which so few remain to remember.
Wc had been happy too at the Pickwick and were sorry to leave, but expansion
had to be served. Not that we have ever aimed to be a big club, for our watchword
has always been quality rather than quantity, but with programmes such as we have,
rood accoustics is a must. Apart from the advent of the St. James Orchestra to
which I have already referred, one event at the Pickwick stands out strongly in mv
mind That was the night in September, 1938, when poor old Chamberlain returned
from Berchtesgarten, waving his umbrella and babbling about Peace in our Time.
Tht e was great tension in the air at that Corroboree, for everybody was expecting
the balloon to go up at any time.

CLAUDE FLEMMING
Chief Savage, 1939-1941.
ANATOL IVANOFF
OUR FIRST FIVE YEARS
The Fifth Annual Meeting, held at the Coronet on May sth, 1939, marked the
completion of our first five years. Perhaps to emphasize this ascent to adolescence,
an amended constitution which had been drawn up by Savage George Christie, the
Club?s Honorary Solicitor, to consolidate and bring up to date the original rules, was
adopted. Our membership was 189, we were in credit to the extent of �IOB/7/9
with �179/1/9 in the Building Fund, and subs, went up to two and a half guineas.
Bill Wood carried on as President, and Claude Flemming took over as Chief Savage.
CLAUDE FLEMMING
Claude was known, I am sure, to everyone of the last generation, for with
Gladys Moncrieff in the ?Maid of the Mountains? he was the answer to every
maiden?s prayer and no doubt he answered quite a few.
He was also a?man?s man,? which perhaps is an unusual quality for a matinee
idol. He was excellent company, told a splendid story and was just the type of chap
to conduct a programme at a Savage Club. With his background of a lifetime of
acting he put things over with consummate skill and with his hormrimmed glasses
which lam sure he must have taken to most reluctantly and an excellent cigar,
was a splendid entertainer. ?Anything you say, old boy,? he would murmur when
I was briefing him about this or that. Easy going, urbane, he loved his fellow men
and women. As may be imagined, he told a wonderful story and the one about
the retired Colonel turned gardener who indignantly refused ?to act as stud groom
to any b pumpkin? is still a classic in the Club.
Claude was still very active on the stage and a large party of Savages went along
in December 1940 to the Minerva Theatre at Kings Cross for the first night of Noel
Coward?s ?Design for Living? in which he was playing. When the curtain speeches
were taking place a large boomerang bearing in gold letters ?Koorau'a'boon? went


up to Claude. He was very happy. The following May he had to leave us for a
while to play at the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne in ?Susan and God? and later
in ?The Guardsman.?
The war dealt poor Claude a cruel blow when his only son was killed in action
in the Syrian Campaign. Something went out of Claude with this tragedy.
In later years his heart caused him to take things very quietly, although he still
showed, when he played Buffalo Bill in ?Annie Get Your Gun, ' that he was one
of Australia?s finest theatrical personalities. When he finally took his last curtain in
1952, a number of Savages were amongst the huge crowd of former admirers and
colleagues who bade him farewell.
Glancing back over the pages I seem to be burying all my characters and heroes,
but it must be realised that in many cases I am contracting ten or twenty years into
thumbnail sketches of a few lines. Many of these chaps were the lifeTlood and
character of the Club over these years we are reviewing just as tO'day are many
others who are still downing pints instead of pushing up daisies. The Club is a
living entity and as parts fall and wither others sprout, green and beautiful I have
no one especially in mind to perpetuate our tree of Savagery.
It was in the uneasy period following Munich that we emigrated to the Coronet
but it could be said that coming events were already casting their shadows before
them in the speaker at our first luncheon address at the new venue in May, 1939.
It was by Colonel Francis Lorenzo, Director of National Emergency Services, who
spoke to us on the work of which he was in charge. It was difficult, after hearing
of all the appalling damage that unrestricted bombing could bring down upon
civilized cities and human flesh, and coming out into the happy sunshine, to realize
that this was in fact just around the corner. We all, I suppose, had too much of
that very human quality of wishful thinking that engendered the feeling that it
couldn?t happen here. Perhaps, too, we believed in human decency and what we
call a ?fair go." But, as we all know, with an insatiable fanatic of Hitler?s type it
was, in fact, all too true, and the brief respite which had been gained by appeasement
soon ran out and war was upon us in September, 1939.
WAR COMES
We were at first a little at a loss to know what to do; whether we should cease
operations or whether, on the contrary, the need for the Club would actually be
intensified by what it could do for its members and our fellow'men generally.
My notice for September 22nd, 1939, read: ?Since last we met the tragedy of
war has come upon us as a nation and one and all we will no doubt be called upon to
bear many trials in the future. It is in the bearing of this mental strain and in the
assisting of others to do likewise that such a Club as ours can play an important part.
Many of the older members have told me that the Savage Clubs in Melbourne, New
Zealand and London were never more active than during the 1914T918 conflict.
Here is our cue and it is up to us to do everything that is within our power to make
the Club a real force for optimism and cheerfulness not only to its members but to
the community as a whole.?


GOOD-BYE TO FRED HYDE
With the advent of the war, Brave Fred Hyde
decided to return to his native New Zealand. His parents
were old, he had been away for many years and in
time of stress there is no place like beside our ain folk.
Fred Hyde, as the story of our cavalcade to date has
clearly shown, had played a leading part in the develop'
ment of the Club since the very early days. He was
a first'dass pianist and good company. Dapper, dark,
vivacious, he exuded keenness and his work in developing
and encouraging the Club Choir had been outstanding.
In recognition of his zeal in their interest the Choir
gave him a special send'olf at a function at Schofield
House, Point Piper, while the Savages as a whole said
au revoir at the October, 1939, Corroboree. On this
occasion the entire programme was provided by Club
members, the Choir playing a prominent part in honour
of its leader. Fred was made a Life Member, our second,
FRED HYDE
who organised and con'
ducted the first Club Choir.
He returned to his native
New Zealand in 1939.
presented with a wallet of notes, and left these shores with the good wishes of every
Sydney Savage. He joined up in New Zealand and afterwards his talent soon found
expression in the field of broadcasting, and he has been associated ever since with
the National Broadcasting Service at Station 3YA, Christchurch as Senior Announcer.
He is obviously happy in his new sphere and in one of his letters enthusiastically
told me how he was producing and recording a series of ballet progammes. He was
married in 1948 and so yet another eligible Savage bachelor went west ?or, in this
case, east. He has not been back to Australia since but we correspond regularly
every year. Fred Hyde has only to set foot again in Sydney and he can rest assured
that his erstwhile cobbers will indeed do him proud.
Having recovered from those bleak words over the air from Downing Street
u We are now at war with Germany? the Club immediately cast about to see
how it could be of service and, realizing the value of music, singing and laughter as
a morale builder, a concert was arranged for a militia unit the Machine Gun
section of the Australian Light Horse in camp at Campbelltown, which was under
the command of Colonel Dave Whitehead, a friend of a number of Savages.
Organized by Savage Jimmy Brunton Gibb and conducted in his own faultless style,
it was a grand success with an attendance of over 500 diggers in embryo; Jim Kirby,
who had made the suggestion, organized the transport for the party.
This success gave us the idea that the Club with its wealth of talent was
particularly fitted to conduct such entertainment, and Claude Flemming proposed that
a concert should be held at the Theatre Royal on a Sunday night in aid of the Lord
Mayor?s Patriotic Fund. He approached E. J. Tait who readily agreed to make the
theatre available. Application to the Chief Secretary, however, for permission to
hold the function on a Sunday night brought us slap bang up against the dead hand
of bureaucratic officialdom. Everything worthwhile was verboten. It was rather
ironic. Permission to hold the function was actually granted but on condition that
all stage turns and humorous items were eliminated and, further, that programmes
could not be sold for any charge. A wake would have been more exciting and sc
all this welhdirected and enthusiastic goodwill withered and died, for it was obvious
that under these restrictive conditions the function would have been abortive.
Claude?s comments were choice, explicit but unprintable.


PATRIOTIC FERVOUR
Savage Jack Strong had been in London on that fateful September 4th, and at
the February 19-10 Luncheon he told us ?How England met the War,? giving us
his own eloquent impressions of the quiet firmness and fortitude with which the
Britisher met the start of yet another war. Jack, who has always been a great
admirer of Britain and the British, in a splendid address made us feel proud to be of
the same stock as these Island people who had told Hitler to go to the devil.
The first Corroboree after the outbreak of war was in May, 1940, following our
annual recess. By a happy coincidence, the night fell on May 24th and so it was
made an Empire Night Corroboree, and the atmosphere was charged with great
patriotic fervour, our chief guest appropriately being Captain H. B. Farncombe of
the H.M.A.S. Perth who, with the present Admiral Sir John Collins, was amongst
the initial cadets at Australia?s Jervis Bay Naval College. He told us of the Perth?s
goodwill cruise to New York, which had been interrupted by the outbreak of war,
and activities since. Several of our Service guests at this Corroboree fully endorsed
in their speeches our policy of carrying on, stressing the value of such relaxation.
Encouraged, we went ahead and arranged a Services Night for July at which leading
representatives of the Navy, Army and Air Force were present and many Savages
brought along men in uniform as their guests. Savage Colonel Wally Farr made the
speech of the evening in proposing the Toast of our Service Guests, all of whom,
even the Silent Service, responded enthusiastically to the good fellowship and gaiety.
To see them so happy and jolly we felt we were helping just a little bit.
A War Savings Certificate programme was instituted on this night and over the
war period several thousands of pounds were subscribed by Club Members. In
addition, every night the Union Jack was brought forward and a throwdn conducted
for the Lord Mayor?s Patriotic Fund, this seldom producing less than TlO per night,
so that quite a lot was raised over the years.
The Sixth Annual Meeting took place on April sth, 1940, at the Coronet,
President Bill Wood and Chief Savage Claude Flemming continuing. Under the
amended Constitution, Vice-Presidents had been eliminated, the four Braves,
however, were John O?Donnell, George Wilson, Eric Gordon and Bill Lewis.
It was at this annual meeting that Ben Andrew finally left us for Melbourne,
and a travelling case was presented to him from the Sydney Savages. Ben, over the
years, had been most energetic and had done splendid work for the Choir which
was very dear to his heart. I have already mentioned his fiery seal in arranging the
two ?Great Tribal Raids? at Tung Yu Park, and should add that this was followed
by another in the following year at the Log Cabin at Penrith.
Ben loves company and cannot be idle so, as I?ve mentioned earlier, he joined
the "Bread and Cheese Club? in Melbourne and in a letter in 1943 he informed me
that he had risen to the exalted position of ?Chief Corkscrew? in this organisation;
his Savage friends jokingly opined that he always was a bit screwy.
In his letter he told me of the splendid work that this Club had been carrying
out in assisting struggling writers and poets to publish their works which are backed
by the Club, while also facilities are made available for young painters to display
their pictures whereby encouraging sales are made. This is indeed good practical
stuff.
Dear old George Cowie, so thin and so intense, was very worked up at this
period and, as can be imagined, used to become very emotional and rhetorical when
delivering his initial Benedicite.


He always started off with ?Bcnedictus, benedicat; Benedicto, benedicat,
guadeamus igitur,?? then gave his pep talk finishing off with ?on with the dance, let
joy be unconfined!? The more keyed up he became the more broad became his
accent, until sometimes only George Smith could follow the rolling r?s. George
doesn?t come along much now. We know he?s taking things quieter after his thirty
years at his Church, but we miss him.
At one of our Corroborees towards the end of 1939, a boxing display had been
arranged by members of the Police Boys? Club, that splendid movement which had
been introduced by Commissioner W. J. Mackay. Quite new then, its practical
conception and great possibilities were capturing the public imagination and we, as
a Club, were anxious to assist where we could. In March, 1940, the Club was
asked to pay a return visit to the Police Boys? Club at Woolloomoolloo, so Savages
could see the movement in action. A considerable number of Savages attended and
saw some 300 boys being instructed in boxing, wrestling and other gymnastics who,
but for this vigorous, healthy influence, may have been subject to the demoralization
that emanates from hanging around street corners. The manner in which this
movement has expanded and prospered over the years has been a matter of
satisfaction to the Club, for we have always had a permanent link in the person of
Savage George Smith, who has played an important part in its development.
FRED BLUETT
Another item that caught my eye was the conferring of Honorary Membership
upon Fred Bluett. Fred had been along to the Club a number of times and delighted
us with his humorous songs, never, of course, being allowed to sit down until he had
rendered his classic, ?The Body in the Bag,?? which no matter how often one heard
it, through the magic of his raspy old voice and plastic face, never ceased to delight.
Fred, the father of comedian Gus Bluett (remember, ?Shall I have it bobbed or
shingled?) who gave such pleasure to Australian audiences before his early death
and of talented Kitty Bluett, was a grand character of the Australian stage. He was
very pleased at being made an Honorary Member of the Club and came along fairly
regularly until he died in 1942.
It was in January 1940 that two outstanding Australians who had made names
for themselves overseas, returned to their native shores. They were Harold Williams
and Wilfrid Thomas. Both were well known to us all through their work but not
to so many personally. Letters of welcome were written and Honorary Membership
of the Club extended. These splendid chaps were both destined to play important
parts in the future of the Club, Harold becoming President, and Wilfrid, Chief
Savage.
In view of the times it was felt that the holding of a Ladies? Night would be
inappropriate with so many of our members and fellow citizens serving abroad and
far away from their hearths and homes, so Ladies' Nights were suspended until 1944.
A COLOURFUL CHARACTER
We made a point of endeavouring to obtain an outstanding figure from one of
the Services as Club guest at each Corroboree. Thus in October we had that
colourful character, Rear-Admiral G. C. Muirhead-Gould, Commander of Naval
Establishments in Sydney at that time. A typical bluff sea-dog type, he had been
for some years Naval Attache in Berlin, and told some splendid stories about the
triple leaders of the Nazi hierarchy - Hitler, Goering and Goebels with whom
he had come into personal contact.


The best story was probably that of a peasant who was given a lift in the
Fuehrer?s car which contained the illustrious trio. Hitler asked if the peasant
recognised him and got a phlegmatic reply in the negative. Despite his array of
medals, Goering was also not recognised and, in response to insistent claims that he
was Goering and the passenger who spoke previously was Hitler, the peasant, unable
to stand it any longer, said: ?And I suppose you'll tell me that the pasty-faced little
Jew with you is Goebels; if so, I?ll get out and walk.??
Asked of his impression of the Fuhrer he said that Hitler is a seemingly common-
place type of man ; he does not smoke nor drink, and he has not any lady friends as
far as is known. One of the boys chipped in, ?What does he do, eat grass like
Nebuchadnezzar??
It was my privilege to propose the toast of Our Guests and in honour of the
Admiral I quoted with, I don?t mind admitting, the feelings that these splendid words
always arouse in one, Nelson?s famous Prayer Before Trafalgar.
?May the Great God whom I worship grant to my country
and for the benefit of all Europe in general, a great and
glorious victory and may no misconduct in any one tarnish
it, and may humanity after victory be the predominant feature
of the British Fleet.
?For myself I commit my life to Him Who made me, and
may His blessing light upon my endeavours for serving my
country faithfully. To Him I resign myself, and the just
cause entrusted to me to defend. Amen. Amen. Amen.?
Muirhead-Gould was a great favourite with the Savages and was with us a
number of times. He left Australia, with his young twin sons, whom he loved to
dress in sailor suits, in 1944 to return to the Royal Navy. He died at sea a year
later after taking the German surrender of Heligoland.
Speaking of this old sea-dog reminds me of those thrilling days in 1940 when
Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Mauretania and A quitanva were first in Sydney
Harbour after performing their wonderful feats transporting our troops. We
extended invitations to the various skippers but, of course, they had many more
vital things to do. In later years, however, when Sir James Bisset and his Lady
came to live in Sydney, after his unique record of wartime Captain of both the
?Queens,? we had the pleasure of having him along with us at the Club on several
occasions and also to speak to us on his seagoing career at one of our Luncheons.
What a man, bubbling over with good humour and vitality as he told us, chuckling
the while, how he transported hundreds of thousands of troops during the war years
without losing a single life.

THE YEAR 1940 saw the commencement of another Savage
institution our Club Magazine, ?Koora-na-boon.? We have
to thank Savage Bill Sellen for this. A printer by occupation,
Bill felt that with many Savages going into the Services and our
friends being scattered around the globe, a Club Magazine would
serve the purpose of keeping members in touch with Club life
CHAPTER VIII
OUR TRADITION GROWS
as well as providing a medium to direct the attention of all
Savages to the Club?s purpose and ideals. Ffe generously offered to print and
produce the little monthly brochure gratis. This splendid gesture was gratefully
accepted.
CLUB MAGAZINE
Savage John O?Donnell undertook to edit it, and so in April, 1940, Vol. 1,
No. 1 of ??Kooramaffioon??? ??Official Magazine of Sydney Savage Club? was
produced. It consisted of four pages with sketches and illustrations.
The first editorial ran ?
?For some time past it has been felt necessary to have the means of keeping
what a Savage once described as ?the inarticulate majority? in touch with Club
activities. Far too many of our members enjoy the pleasant associations and musical
and ether offerings at Corroborees but ?tween these festive occasions forget they
are Savages.
?If the Sydney Savage Club is to take its rightful place in the social life of our
community its members must all be conscious of the privileges of membership and
the opportunities offered to accomplish something of a lasting nature.

TITLE PAGE FROM ?KOORA'NA-BOON?
Tae Club s objectives are symbolised in the scroll, masks, palette, lyre and book
We have adopted as a Club greeting the aboriginal word 'KOORA'NA'EOON?
which literally translated is Sit down, all about, Brother. Membership of the
Club is a privilege which is jealously guarded by those to whom members have
given over the management of the Club, and there is no room within it for the
Philistine.
You can, no matter how busy you are, spare some little time to further the
objects of the Club which offers you privileges unique.?
Koora-na'boon was published till July 1941 (Vol. 1, Nos. M 2) when Captain
W. H. Sellen left for Darwin with a complete printing unit to produce Army J\[ews,
which proved a great boon to the troops in the remote areas. Sometime later Bill
was badly cracked up in an aircraft accident and, after many months in hospital, was
invalided out of the Army and returned to his calling. With our Savage editor
John O Donnell and Savage printer Bill Sellen, both on fulhtime military duty, and
stringent paper rationing on our tail, KooramaAoon looked doomed, but John, by
remote control and with the help of Savage ?Chev? Mola?s copying office, after a
break of three months, managed to produce an issue in duplicated form.? In his
Editorial he said it was the many letters of appreciation from overseas Savages athirst
for news, that had spurred him on to this new effort. (See Chapter X.) Five of these
issues came out spasmodically from October 1941 to June 1944.
Then once again, there was a break till after the war in 1946, when three more
issues (ApribNovember, 1946) were produced by Savage Ted Geach, but it was not
till two years later when it was taken over by Savage Cas Marshall that Koorama'boon
was on its feet again. Cas, a comparatively new Savage, was a live wire associated
with the publicity side of the motion picture industry and he was soon bringing out
Koora'na'boon three times a year, a bigger and better edition and, true to his* film
tradition, with plenty of ?pix.? These candid camera shots of our activities over the
next two years have been a great help in illustrating this book, and it is a pity that
we didn?t do more of it before to capture some of the personalities and highlights


in our early days. With merry quip ever on his lips, Cas carried on in his racy
style, editing the magazine till 1950, when he, too, had to call for a respite as
the result of assuming more onerous responsibilities in his own professional sphere.
He had brought out nine issues from April 1948 to September 1950. Since then
we?ve only had one a year, the bulk of the contents being the substance of the
comprehensive annual report that I prepare, reviewing the year?s activities. It would
be a great boon (no pun intended) if Koord'na'boon could get under way again with
something of its former vigour. It serves a splendid purpose and I hope we shall
soon find new and vigorous blood with a tinge of printers? ink in it to take over. I?d
do it myself, willingly, but unfortunately I too am more than fully occupied with
my professional work and other interests.
CRANA CRANA
The year 1940 saw the introduction of yet another facet of our Savage
tradition, in our Savage Welcome. Jim Brunton Gibb had introduced a number of
aboriginal words into our Corroborees (I?ve just found a list in his copperplate
hand) and this appealed very much to Claude Flemming who, since he had come
in Contact with Arunta art during his work with the 150 th Anniversary Celebrations,
had become very keen on aboriginal lore and culture. He suggested to Jim that
he prepare an aboriginal welcome. Jim went to work and, as facile in this tongue
as in English, produced A Savage Welcome which he first rendered in April, 1940.
An instant success, it is now spoken by Jim, who rolls the colourful aboriginal words
off his tongue with practiced grace, or a deputed Savage in the Original Yabba
followed by the Translation at every Corroboree and always fascinates our guests,
particularly visitors from overseas.
This, together with the Opening and Closing Odes and the Toast to our
Guests, is presented in a folder entitled ?Songs of the Tribe,? which is on every
table at every Corroboree. Admonition at bottom of page: Not to be taken away.
IN the case of visitors from abroad we waive this and let them take one along as a
souvenir.

It was not till 1945 that the coping stone of our Savage songs was laid when
a competition amongst members was held for the composition of a Closing Ode
We had had an Opening Ode since our very first Corroboree but had not got around
to a Closing Ode. A number of entries were received, the winning one embracing
music by Savage Lindley Evans and words by Savage Brunton Gibb, a happy
combination of the talents of these two Savages.
All Corroborees since then have closed on this plaintive note.
CLOSING ODE
The Savage camp-fire soon will fade,
The Gunyah silent be;
But memories will long remain
Of this Corroboree.
As friends we met, as friends we part,
May friendship with us bide,
A unison of mind and heart.
Born of a Savage pride.
The fire-starred Mirrabooka shines
A welcome from the sky;
The mopoke calls along the creek,
The ?possum swings on high.
Soon will the boomerang speed on,
Silent the Gunyah be;
Then, Savages, good-bye until
Our next Corroboree.
Words by Savage J. Brunton Gibb. Music by Savage Lindley Evans.
Yet another little bit of ritual that came forward about this time was our
Savage substitute for the time-honoured 'Tor He?s A Jolly Good Fellow with which
we greet our guests. As usual, J.B.G. was the author.
OUR GUESTS
SAVAGES GREET YOU
(Tune: ?Waltzing Matilda?)
Savages meet you,
Savages greet you.
Savages treat you
To story, song and tune.
Once again before long
May you drink at our billabong.
Savages greet you with Koora-na-boon.
Now an indissoluble part of every Corroboree, it never ceases to delight our
guests.


THE CLUB CHOIR
With the departure of Fred Hyde who had created and nurtured the choir
until it had developed into a most important part of Club life, and subsequently of
Ben Andrew, who had been its energetic secretary, the rudderless members had to
look around for new leadership. Savage John Hulme-Smith became choir conductor
with Eric Pearse as honorary painist and Sid Gould as choir secretary, and the good
work was well carried on. In fact the choir rose to great heights at the October
1940 Corroboree when they rendered with great patriotic vigour Sir Charles Villiers
Stanford?s "Songs of the Fleet," with Savage Stanley Clarkson as soloist. This was
only possible by the help and co-operation of members of the Sydney Male Choir
with whom we had an enthusiastic member in common in Joe Weatherley.
When Savages sit back to enjoy the harmony of the splendid trained and
disciplined choir ?and what is more satisfying than a good male choir? ?the many
hours of practice and rehearsal tend to be overlooked. All our Savage choir members
were occupied at their various avocations during the day and so these training
periods were perforce at night, very often at the homes of the different members.
In the early days these were carried on for many years at the Wahroonga home of
Bill Kither and in this hospitable atmosphere a little Club within a Club developed
that was very dear to the hearts of those who enjoyed its select membership. Later
"Smithy," the new conductor and his good wife carried on the tradition until, its
ranks decimated by more and more leaving on war service, the choir had to disband
and did not rise again until some years later in 1946 when Savage Ivan Rixon brought
together a dozen talented young singers who, under his expert leadership, were
soon welded into a really fine choir.
There was one figure of the choir days that deserves special mention: it was
Alf James. Not only was Alt' a choir enthusiast but he used to handle the decorations
at all our Corroborees and for special occasions it was nothing for him to be at the
Markets at the crack of dawn to secure flowers and greenery for that purpose. His
greatest effort was at the Grace Auditorium when the stage was covered with large
gum-tree limbs and other greenery from which peeped Koalas, Kangaroos and
Kookaburras which he had secured from a taxidermist friend.
SAVAGE DECORATIONS

THESE WERE WORRYING days when the British people
were sustaining blow after blow and the Axis Powers seemed
to take trick after trick. We were alone against the frightful
onslaught of unbridled aggression and were finding how all too
true was Churchill?s promise of naught but ?blood, toil, tears
and sweat.? But there was too a fierce pride in this lonely

THE WAR YEARS
defiance, as those on the sidelines were saying not how long can
they hold out, but when will they fall.
Our Savage Poet Laureate, Jim Brunton Gibb, captured the spirit of the hour
in the lines that he wrote entitled ?The Long, Long Trail.? As a first war Digger,
every tune and place name that he strung together must have brought back very
vivid memories to him.
THE LONG, LONG TRAIL
J. Brunton Gibb
?There?s a long, long trail a-wmding,?
And it takes us back again
To the cobble roads of Flanders,
Where we marched to the refrain
Of ?Keep the home fires burning.?
Or ?Who?s your lady friend??
?There?s a long, long trail a-winding?
Will it never, never end?
From barrack'square and camp ground,
?Neath blue Australian skies,
The ?Tipperary? strains were heard
(The song that never dies).
We ?Packed up all our troubles?
In the kit-bags that we know,
And soon on Aneac shore there leapt
The ?digger Kangaroo.?
They sang ?Australia will be there.?
Those ?Boys of Dardanelles,?
On troopship and Gallipoli
To scream of bursting shells;
And when to France they journeyed,
And sang the ?Marseillaise,?
The whole round world was singing, too,
A chorus in their praise.


To "Joan of Arc? and "Piocardy,?
And "Rose of No Man?s Land,?
With Tommy and with Poilu
The Diggers took their stand.
To win a war to end all wars
At least, so we were told,
But fruitless was the victory
For which great lives were sold.
And now the younger race has come
To sing the songs they sang,
The songs that in French billets
Or estaminets once rang
With "Madamoiselle from Armentiers,?
"Are we downhearted? No!?
"Good'bye-ee,? "So Long, Letty,?
Or ?Where did that one go??
But when they pass through Menin Gate,
Or march up to the line,
The ?ghosts of lost brigades? who still
Chant strains of "Auld Lang Syne? ?
Will wonder at the youngsters
Who have no time for talk,
As with swinging step and lusty "hoi!?
They sing ?The Lambeth Walk.?
And mothers, sisters, sweethearts, wives,
Whose homes these men keep free,
Still sing the song their mothers sang
?God send You Back to Me.?
And send you back in peace
To ?Silver hair and heart of gold,"
Before they get "Too old to dream?
Or victory to behold.
Sing on, sing on, you soldier boys,
From barracks to Berlin;
Who prays with God and sings with man
Must triumph and must win.
Keep "Tipperary? on your lips
And, tho? your strength be gone,
Your hearts will show you still the way
To fight ?and CARRY ON!


.
E. R. BADGERY'PARKER
President 1941T943.
As always in adversity we were finding
that the warm association with our fellows pro'
vided us with moral refreshment and spiritual
stimulus. (I know the use of the words refresh'
ment and spiritual will be misconstrued by some
cynics). Every Corroboree was well besprinkled
with uniforms and one by one our own members
slipped away to reappear for a short time as
sailors, soldiers, or airmen. Sometimes we saw
them not at all for months or years or sometimes
spasmodically when they could spare a moment
from duty.
Just after Christmas 1940 we received a
letter from Bill Wood requesting that he be
relieved from his office of President in view
of his appointment as Officer Commanding the
113 th Australian General Hospital at Yaralla,
Concord, Sydney. (Now the huge Repatriation
Hospital.) This was a tremendous task for Dr.
Wood to undertake, embracing the organisation,
staffing and controlling of this great institution
virtually from scratch, and he felt that he
must give every ounce of his energy and time
to it, a fact that was fully appreciated by all
the members of the Club. As, however, it was our usual three months recess
period he was asked to stay in office until the Annual Meeting. He agreed and was
able to be present at the Seventh Annual Meeting in April, 1941, and handed over
to our fourth President, Savage E. R. BadgeryTarker.
"8.P.?, as he was known, paid eloquent tribute to the wonderful way in which
Dr. Wood had presided over the Club for the past three years. Bill Wood, speaking
with great feeling, said that the words of the song just sung by comedians George
and Bert, "My eyes are dim, I cannot see,? aptly described his present condition.
We presented him with a mulga boomerang suitably inscribed for placing on his
overloaded desk at the Hospital as a memento of his years as President.
?8.P.? TAKES OVER
Badgery'Parker was engaged in the world of advertising and public relations and
had belonged to the Club since early days. My first recollection of B.P. was when,
at the famous meeting at Adam?s Coal Hole, we were cogitating whether we
should carry on and if so, how we should shape our future course, he rose and,
speaking, he said, for the "inarticulate section? of the Club, in a fighting speech
urged that every effort should be made to pursue and achieve our ideals. He was
eloquent also in his first message as President, published in ?Koora-naffioon.?
?LET US MAKE OUR FRIENDSHIP TRUER?
?He stood on my doorstep. A black man. Old he was, with weatherbeaten
face and grilled hair. His eyes were windswept and rheumy. His hands were lean
and scarred and horny. When I demanded what he did there, he answered with
the magnificent eloquence of simplicity, ?Sir, I have come to make your garden
beautiful!?


?What is my message to you? It?s somewhere deep buried in that black man s
heart.
?Away behind our cynicism, underneath the bland veneer of modern civilization,
beyond the arrogance and intolerance of our business conduct, above the schemes
and desires of our ambitious hearts ?far from our superiorities, our inferiorities, our
efficiencies and deficiencies, our poise, our complacency, our condescensions and all
our other make'believers, there is an eloquent simplicity, a music akin to the song
in the black man?s heart?it?s the music of fellowship.
?You?ll find it in the heart of the man sitting next to you at the Corroboree ?
you'll find it in the gift which the artist makes to his art. And if you look ever so
closely and listen ever so quietly, you?ll find that same music within yourself.??
B.P. had a very clear perception, a rather puckish sense of humour and when
the occasion demanded, could be very much to the point.
During these first years of war many of us used to listen to Colin Wills?Author
of our Opening Ode?who was a special announcer with the B.C.C. He told of
the calm and confident bearing of the average Britisher in the face of nightly
bombing raids and how even August Bank Holiday was celebrated on Hampstead
Heath and, although no holiday was proclaimed, a few enthusiasts saw that the
traditional coconut-shies were erected and some costers paraded in their ?pearlies.??
We thought Colin did a pretty good job in those critical years.
Interesting folk who visited us during 1940 were that charming actor Edwin
Styles who, with Lloyd Lamble, came along after their Minerva show; Neville
Cardus, who blew in about 11 o?clock to one Corroboree; and Ivan Menzies from the
Gilbert and Sullivan Company who spoke to us on Moral Rearmament and showed
the M.R.A. film, ?The Rise of a New Spirit.? Ventriloquist Mai Verco and Ginger,
so popular on the air at that time, was also on one of our programmes.
WILFRID THOMAS
This year our Savage brothers Harold Williams and Wilfrid Thomas made
their respective debuts amongst us.
?Wilf? spoke to us at the March Luncheon on ?Broadcasting Around the
World.? In the intimate conversational manner that he does so well in his broad-
casts, he told of two young musical enthusiasts who used to arrive at Beale?s piano
establishment each morning an hour before opening time and practised songs and
accompaniments till the first customer arrived, whereby use of piano and practice
room cost them nothing. Later they were able to afford the eighteenpence necessary
to hire one of those tiny rooms in Ash Street for an hour. One day, when Wilfrid
and Savage Dick Thew?for he was the other enthusiast?were hard at practice
the door was flung open and in stalked Australia?s Queen of Song?Dame Nellie
Melba. She demanded his name. He obliged. ?How old are you?? she then
queried. He was around the twenty mark. ?I wish to hell I was,? she countered
and proceeded to accompany the startled Wilfrid in some songs, telling him she
predicted a future for him.
Soon after Wilfrid, a basso, joined Edward Branscombe?s Concert Party and
toured Australia and later to Singapore and all ports east and so to London where
he secured an engagement to sing in a 8.8.C. programme for Australian listeners.
As time went on the ?mike? prevailed, and Wilfrid Thomas to-day occupies a unique
place in radio. It?s always a pleasure to ?have him at our place.?

WILFRID THOMAS RECEIVES HONOUR PLAQUE
as a Past Chief Savage, from President Lindley Evans, with Honorary Secretary Adrian
Ashton looking on.
Harold Williams, world-famous baritone, was with us for the first time after
returning to his native land, as guest of honour at our first Corroboree for 1941,
when we sat and listened enthralled to the wonderful broadcast from the Savage
Chub in London, which had taken place virtually in the short respite between the
nightly bombing. (See Chapter IV). Chief Savage Jim Brunton Gibb, in welcoming
Savage Harold Williams, said he was his superior officer in the Great War, being
a Second Class Warrant Officer, no Sam Browne, no salute, no mister; he (J.8.G.)
was merely a temporary unpaid Lance Corporal. After the London broadcast,
Harold sang to us, the first occasion of many that we were to have the pleasure of
listening to his rich and beautiful voice.
As always we had some interesting characters as our guests, the war to some
extent influencing our choice. Thus we had Mr. Ely Palmer, the United States
Consul General; Mr. Andre Brenac, Leader of the Free French Movement in
Australia; Colonel Wilfred Vickers, head of the 8.M.A., and Alan Williamson
President of Sydney Legacy, with whom the Sydney Savage Club has always enjoyed
such firm relations, for so many of our members are also Legatees. Well-known
radio personality, Harry Dearth, gave a talk on ?Radio as an Art.? He knew all
about Savage Clubs for he told us that his father, one of England?s finest bass
singers, had been a member of the Savage in London for many years.


Our 1941 Christmas Corroboree programme reveals that in spite of war wastage
we were still able to put on a good show. Savage Frank Hutchens, the Conservatorium
Instrumental Trio, George Brown and Bert Harrow, Savage Fred Bluett, Jack hums'
dame, Frank Ryan, the Mastersingers? Quartette. Savage Stanley Clarkson, Savage
Ron Dowd, Wilfrid Thomas, Wally Baynes, Savage Frank Dines and Horne Dargie;
that by any standards is a most impressive programme.
WALLY BAYNES
Wally Baynes, in private life a decorous executive of the New South Wales
Tourist Bureau, was one of the funniest chaps we have ever had. No matter what
his item he seldom was allowed to sit down without giving his version of the
blacksmith who had to recite ?Casabianca at the Church Social and had taken
several doses of Dutch courage to steady his nerves. He put so much feeling into
this rendition, precariously swaying about the while, inanely grinning and burping
outrageously that the gathering were virtually rolling in the aisles. The crescendo
of hilarity was reached with his gestures to parts of his anatomy to remind his
befuddled brain of the spreading chestnut tree into which he had wandered from
Lord Ullin?s daughter. Each stanza was wound up by a raucous whacko! so that
Wally became known as ?Whacko.? He has given us great pleasure for many years.
And so 1941 floated ?or was blasted?away. It had been a hard year and few
were sorry to see it go, though following the dramatic incidents at Pearl Harbour
in the early morning of December 7th, we were no longer fighting alone.
GRIM DAYS
The early days of 1942 were grim. We had been deeply shocked by the
incredible sinking of the ?Prince of Wales? and the ?Repulse by Jap. planes.
These great vessels had just arrived and we had breathed a sigh of relief, for with
their comforting presence and the ?impregnable? fortress of Singapore, we felt we
had some tangible protection in the North.
Then Singapore fell on February 15th. Four days later on "Black Thursday,?
Darwin was bombed by Japanese planes and although we then had little inkling
of the great extent of this disaster, it made a deep impression. Our country was
at last under direct attack from the enemy.
When General Douglas Mac Arthur, under orders from President Roosevelt,
reluctantly left beleagured Corregidor in the Philippines and landed in Australia in
March, 1942, there was great excitement. When at Canberra, dramatically clasping
the hand of Prime Minister John Curtin, he said, ?You and I will see this through
together,? we did not feel quite so alone and out on a limb as we had, for Mac'
Arthur?s confident bearing and the pledge of support from his great country, was
just the stimulus that we needed. History records how truly he kept this pledge,
just as he swore, as he left the Philippines, ?I shall return.?
At first he was disillusioned not to find more American troops in Australia,
but as the months went by great convoys of troopships arrived silently in Melbourne
and many hundreds of thousands of ?Yanks? came amongst us for short periods,
as following their forceful leader they went steadily northwards; Melbourne, Sydney,
Brisbane, New Guinea, Guadalcanal, The Philippines?and Tokio.
Many American servicemen came along to Corroborees, some as Club guests,
others with Savage friends. One and all they loved the friendly, free and easy
atmosphere and were quick to express their appreciation.

WARTIME CORROBOREE
At many of our wartime Corroborees we entertained Servicemen from Great Britain, the United
States and New Zealand as well as, of course, hundreds of our own countrymen. This group
shows (from left to right) Honorary Treasurer Trevor Daniel, Chief Savage Jim Brunton Gibb,
Captain B. Korpowski, R.A.F., Wing Commander Norman Simmons, R.A.A.F., and President
Findley Evans. Capt. Korpowski was a highly decorated Polish member of the R.A.F. Middle
East Group. Both the airmen are relaxing in mufti.
Savages as a rule are not sad folk, but in these years of strain and uncertainty
,there were many serious moments as some fine lines were read at our Corroborees
I bad preserved copies of these two that impressed me deeply.
A SOLDIER?S PRAYER
(New Guinea, 1943)
If I should die, God grant that I might live
In the hearts of those I love and leave awhile,
Let not a monument of rugged stone,
Or work of man record for eyes to see
That it was but my privilege to die
In this great cause. But let all hearts unite
In one great fellowship of peace and love.
With kindly thoughts for those who do return ?
Those men with whom the jungle trails Eve trod,
And laughed and prayed, and cursed the wrongs of war.
In hearts that strive to build the world anew
Erom broken pieces, but with Christian thought,
There Christ must surely be. In such blest hearts
May my memorial live.
?From the Queensland ?Anzac Day Book" for 1945,


A ''
A SOLDIER SPEAKS
So you?re sick of the way the country?s run,
And you?re sick of the way the rationing?s done,
And your sick of standing around in a line;
You?re sick you say ?well, that?s just fine.
So am I sick of the sun and the heat,
And I?m sick of the feel of my aching feet,
And I'm sick of the siren?s wailing shriek.
And I?m sick of the groans of the wounded and the weak,
I'm sick of the slaughter?l?m sick to my soul,
I'm sick of playing a killer?s role.
I?m sick of blood and of death and the shell,
And I?m even sick of myself as well.
But I?m cured darned quick when I think of the day,
When all this hell will be out of the way,
When none of this mess will have been in vain,
And the lights of the world will blaze again,
And the Axis flags will be dipped and furled,
And God looks down on a peaceful world.
-?From ?Spirella? Magazine


THE SAVAGE CLUB cannot be described as essentially a
young man?s Club and consequently while the younger members
joined the various active Services, many of the older men,
anxious to serve in any capacity whatsoever, gradually found
means by which they could so serve, either in the Services or in
ministries or essential industry.
CHAPTER X
SAVAGES ON SERVICE
? ' uumuwiivu w j
(After offering my services, I was appointed Architect to
the Ministry of Munitions, fortunately being stationed in Sydney so that I was still
enabled to carry on my work for the Club in the few odd hours available).
It was about this time that a number of the Savages got together to bid bon
voyage to Savage Dr. John Belisario who was about to leave for abroad where his
inseparable colleague Savage Dr. Derby Loudon was already with the A.I.F. in
the Middle East. We sadly missed these ?Terrible Twins? and their boisterous
presence. Similar sendoffs, a mixture of glad and sad, depending on ones
temperament, were quietly going on all the time.
The following list of Club members who were in the Services, which may not
be conclusive for some slipped quietly away without letting us know, was published
in the current issues of ?KooramaToon? so that Savages could write to these absent
cobbers.

Jim Brunton Gibb again took up his facile pen and wrote these telling words
and until the end of the war this toast to our ?Savages on Service" was honoured
with fervour at every Corroboree.


SAVAGES ON SERVICE
To Savages on Service I give this Savage Toast;
Good fighting and good fortune from Reveille to Last Post,
The Great White Chief protect you, on land, in air, on sea,
And bring you back in triumph to a Grand Corroboree.
Thou Who dost love to hear the voice of prayer,
To Thee we come.
Keep Thou Australia?s sons within Thy care
Afar from home;
Keep Thou their souls in steadfastness and right;
Remember, Lord, Australia?s sons to-night!
Another verse sung at all our wartime Corroborees that I know brought a lump
to many a throat, particularly those who had sons on service far away, was
?Australia?s Sons,? which was rendered to the tune of ?Lead Kindly Light.?
AUSTRALIA?S SONS
(Tune: ?Lead Kindly Light?)
Be Thou their refuge in the darkest hour?-
Be Thou their stay.
Stretch forth Thy hand, show Thine Almighty power,
In Thine own way.
Thou didst in Galilee reveal Thy might?
Oh! comfort, Lord, Australia?s sons to-night!
And if at last, O Lord, for us they die
In mortal strife,
Bear them in mercy to Thy home on high
From death to life ?
Dispel the gloom with pure celestial light
Remember, Lord, Australia?s sons to-night!
To most people loneliness is one of the worst things in the world to bear,
particularly to a convivial character like a Savage, and so we did all we possibly
could by remote control to bridge the gap between the Club and our Savages on
Service. There were three main avenues: letters, parcels and ?Koora-na-boon,?
and we did our best in each direction, the first being mainly an individual personal
effort but the other two were carried out by the Club.
It was really most moving to read some of the letters from these home-sick,
war-weary, lonely souls, who grasped at these small crumbs of comfort from the
happy days remembered and which conjured up glad thoughts of that blessed time
to come, ?after the war.? Going through the file of these letters written to John
O?Donnell, George Wilson, Jim Brunton Gibb and myself, I feel, to regain and to
.retain some of the character of these days, I should quote from a few, for fellows in
these precious lines revealed their true feelings.


SAVAGE SOLDIERS
Ron Dowd, a Lance-Sergeant in the 2/A.A.M.C., wrote to John O'Donnell.
Have just received your June issue of ?Koora-na-boon."
Associations that I made at our respected Club have always
remained with me and a flood of memories hit me with the
receipt of the journal. Perusal of the pages brought to light
Ted Geach?s letters. He is a close friend of mine?we enlisted
together?and it is of keen interest to me to know of Ted's
love of Savagery.
Mention of programmes and names such as Dick Thew,
Stan Clarkson, Jim Gibb and all those other men gave me a
semi-nostalgic pain for the very home of good fellowship.
My conscience! How I could eat those excellent suppers. Dear
old Ivanoff did a great job, both at the normal time and
invariably at the midnight revel.
Fred Bluett?s sudden ?ascension" into his long rest was an
unexpected happening. On numerous occasions Fred went out
of his way to extend his advice and encouragement to me as
a very ?fresh" performer. No doubt there are many others
who would similarly echo my remarks, and all of those who
knew him ?even ever so slightly?loved his intriguing and
distinctly genuine atmosphere. His name must surely find its
way to the Savage Honour Roll.
One could elaborate for some time on appreciation of our
Club, but, finally, let me add tribute to your work in the
production of the journal. It is a very real and tangible link
to the former happy hours.
Major Savage Dr. Bob Mackey also said ?much to my surprise a copy of
?Koora-na-boon? arrived last night and the pleasure of receiving and reading it
has been exceedingly great. I am glad the Club is carrying on in the old tradition.'
Savage Lt.-Col. C. S. Thane, Group Commandant P.O.W. Camp at Hay, also
expressed his delight at the receipt of K-N-B, exhorting John to ?please keep me
on the mailing list." Small wonder that John O?Donnell strained every nerve to
keep ?Koora-na-boon" going as long as he possibly could. There?s no doubt that
the friendship of the Club helped our Savages on Service, for if you can?t have a
yarn with a cobber, the next best thing is to write a few lines. Best of all is to have
a letter back.
LETTERS AND LAUGHTER
Jim Brunton Gibb, when he spoke to us on ?Laughing to Win,? also stressed
the importance of optimism and humour as a morale builder. Having been responsible
in a large measure for supplying these intangible qualities ?which are certainly not
found in the quartermaster?s store ?at the 113 th Australian General Hospital for
several years he was fully qualified to speak of their importance, as an actual
therapeutic agent in a military hospital. The soldiers? taste, said Jim, is fairly wide.
Gladys Moncrieff, Peter Dawson, Harold Williams, Strella Wilson, Mai Verco and
Ginger, George Brown and Isador Goodman all being equally popular. In writing
to the boys, said Jim, tell them the latest yarn, keep them up to date with the
stories, new and rejuvenated. Put some sunshine and laughter into your pens!


P mt
\
Next to such mental succour came that very important subject that before the
turn of the century would have been described as ?vittles,? so big food parcels
were kept going out continuously to all our Savages on Service in all theatres of
this great global war. Letters of thanks for these, too, came flowing in. Major
Charles Moses wrote from A.I.F. H.Q., Malaya, ?Will you please pass on to the
Sydney Savages my very sincere thanks for their splendid parcel. It was a very
pleasant surprise, indeed, arriving, as it did, just as we moved into our battle stations.
I look forward keenly to being with you all again at the "Grand Corroboree? ?may
it be reasonably soon.
The mirthful medicos wrote from the "?A.I.F. Abroad.? Savage Lt.'Col. Dr.
John Belisario in expressing his thanks said ""give my personal regards to all Savages
and in particular to Jimmy Brunton Gibb and Jim Meynink (the noisy Savage) and
tell them that Savage (bloody savage too) Derby Loudon and I often have
Corroborees for two and knock a few over in the Gunyah whenever we meet.?
Savage Lt.'Col. Dr. Derby Loudon, after praising the parcel that ""contained all that
a fellow on service could desire, even down to the clothes pegs and Kiwi boot polish,?
said ?congratulations to Jimmy Gibb on his splendid toast to us all here. John
Belisario is well and sparking in all laughs and believe me that is saying something.?
Ted Geach, one of those vital chaps with a merry chuckle and snappy crack
always on his lips, wrote, ?Imagine my surprise and delight to receive a chocolate
packet from Savage Jim Armstrong the other day. Three of my tent mates brought
it down to me with much gutso and when I say gutso, I mean "gutso.? Anyway, I got
a bite of it, and the boys accused me of a bit of espionage after seeing my Japanese
cobber "Koora-naToon" whose name accompanied Jim?s signature on the wrapper.
Took quite a bit of convincing, too, the blighters. Marvellous how they don?t notice
these things until after the chocolate is down about the uvula!?
DARWIN AND NEW GUINEA
From slightly nearer home Savage Capt. Bill Sellen, who was doing a splendid
Job publishing Army ?{ews in Darwin for the troops in Northern Australia, told
of how the Japs, came over (on June 15th, 1942) and ""gave the Press unit the
works, twenty bombs in and around our section completely wiping out our living
LIEUT.'COL DERBY LOUDON.
LIEUT.COL. JOHN BELISARIO


quarters and one end of the factory while the rest is not worth two bob, although
the machinery escaped with little damage. That night I drove forty miles and had
a small sheet multigraphed and distribution was as usual the next day, much to
everybody?s surprise. After four days repairs were completed and it was business
as usual. It was very close and Tooth?s nearly lost a good customer.?
Ted Geach, who was an excellent correspondent, in another letter, this time
from New Guinea, tried to make us believe he didn?t like it. There?s a Savage for
you. He wrote:
TED GEACH
Drawing by John Frith which, together with
a parchment address of appreciation, was
presented to Ted by his Savage brethren when
he left Sydney for Canberra in 1949.
Dear Adrian,
This is just a note from a very wet,
hungry, tired, muddy, fed'Up ?Savage on
Service?! My location is up in the jungle
country of New Guinea ?the place Billy
Hughes fought the League of Nations to
keep for Australia. I wish someone had
belted him over the head with an axe and
saved us all this trouble. Isn?t it funny that
they always seem to pick on deserts, swamps
and jungles to fight in? Why in hell can?t
they select a spot like Bondi Beach to do all
the dirty work in? The game ain?t fair?in
fact, it stinks.
I often think of those Corroboree decora*
tions of spears and tonvtoms which adorn the
dais at the monthly function and smile to
myself. The niggers here wear anything
from military clod'hoppers three sizes too
big to bowler hats. But never a spear, never
a shield, never an assegai.
I thought again of you at the Xmas
Corroboree as I lay wet to the skin on a
wind-swept ridge in the hills. I?d have given
a fiver for one of those baked spuds and a
cup of Savage Ivanoff?s coffee ?or a spot of
good cheer such as only Jim Meynink can
dispense! Oh, well, it?ll keep.
Seriously, tho? ?I really miss Savage Club.
This infantry business means roughing it,
and tho? I like it really, such things as good
music and the inimitable atmosphere of
Savagery are sadly missed.
Koora*na*boon to all Savages until we
meet again.
Ever yours,
SAVAGE TED GEACH.
You?ll notice he can?t sustain the masquerade of a grouch and in his, final para,
admits he?s lapping it up. Ted gave splendid war service: He does nothing by
halves. He?s still in the wilds; this time at Canberra.

m
THE EIGHTH ANNUAL MEETING came along in April,
1942, and and Jimmy Brunton Gibb carried on
in their respective offices of President and Chief Savage.
Parker in his presidential comments said members should feel
very proud that they have been able to keep alive "the green
oasis of Savagery?? in times without precedent. He also felt that
the comradeship within the Club had been bound more firmly
CHAPTER XI
PEARL HARBOUR TO D-DAY
than ever as a result of adversity. The Club had definitely justified its existence
during this period.
As a wartime measure and having regard to the ?brown-out? it was decided
to commence Corroborees at 7.30 and finish at 11 p.m.
Several of our Luncheons this year were of special interest. Captain George
Caiger, who had taught English at Tokyo University for a number of years and
consequently knew something of the Japanese mentality, gave a most interesting
address on "The Spirit of Japan To-day?? a topical subject to say the least. George,
who is now associated with the A.8.C., has spoken to us on a number of occasions
since. With his quiet, easy personality and charming voice he is always a welcome
guest.
My father, Will Ashton, 0.8. E., who was Director of the National Arc
Gallery of New South Wales at this period, told us of the Exhibition of Australian
Art to America, which had been opened at the Washington Art Gallery by the
Hon. R. G. Casey, Australian Minister to the United States, and of his trip to
America in connection with it. He had arrived back in Australia but a few days
before Pearl Harbour,
FRANK SAUNDERS
At one Corroboree in 1942 we celebrated the award of the D.S.C. to Savage
Frank Saunders? son, Dick, who had commanded a M.T.B. in the Scharnhorst-
Gneisenau action in the Channel and had put a torpedo into the Prinz Eugen. Just
before the war, when Frank had given us a talk on reminiscences of his early days
in South Australia as a Mounted Trooper, he had brought along Dick, who had
just joined the Navy, in his Jack Tar?s rig. When he returned to Australia in 1944,
as Lieutenant Richard Saunders, he came again, tall, fair and handsome and modestly
told us of some of his experiences. He subsequently transferred to submarines and
gave distinguished service in the Pacific and having survived all these dangers, such
are the vagaries of fate, was killed in a jeep accident on Morotai in December, 1945.
On the Return Thanks card we received to our letter of sympathy were the
undying words of Rupert Brooke:
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there?s some corner of a foreign field
That is forever England.


Frank was an old-world figure and always wore a high collar and a white stock,
c had one leg that was slightly stiff from some accident and when speaking on
one occasion he told us how when he had to travel by tram to his engineering works
at Rosebery, he always tried to secure an inside seat so that his leg would not cause
inconvenience to the passengers. On this particular occasion he was unable to do
this and, m fact, was right near the door, so as each person got in or alighted, he
stood up. Two small boys m the compartment eyed him off steadily and when he
himself left the tram he heard one say to the other ?Polite old b d, ain?t he.?
Frank was a character in the Club and as he grew older and ceased to come
legularly, some of us used to call at his home at Cremorne and drive him in on special
occasions. He was so proud of Dick, and his tragic death took the heart out of him.
He subsequently went to live at Windsor with one of his children and died last year.
We had some happy Corroborees, this year and running through some of the
programmes I came across a Schumann Quintette with Frank Hutchens, Cyril Monk,
Wffhe Krasmk, Carl Gotsch and Alex Phillips. At another, Lionel Lawson and
Dick Bentley, both violinists, but in vastly separated fields, appeared; also Null and
Void (Savages George Broomhead and Bern Roberts) who gave an item ?cancelling
all previous performances.?
Some fine community singing was a feature, too, in these days and in May,
1942, Stan Clarkson sang the solo verses in ?Love?s Old Sweet Song,? while Harold
the same with ?Cockles and Mussels? and ?There?ll Always be an
England,? which was sung with such fierce emotion in these days as dear old
England was ?taking it? so valiantly and defiantly. ?Cockles and Mussels? was a great
iavounte and I always associate it with Harold Williams who first introduced it to
the Club.
Here it is as he wrote it out for me.
COCKLES AND MUSSELS
(Irish Traditional)
In Dublin?s fair city where girls are so pretty
Twas there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheehbarrow thro? streets broad and
narrow
Crying ?Cockles and mussels, alive, alive^oh.?
She was a fishmonger and shure ?twas no wonder
For so were her father and mother before,
And they both wheeled their barrow thro? streets broad and
narrow
Crying ?Cockles and mussels, alive, alive^oh.?
She died of a fever* and no one could save ?er
And that was the end of Sweet Molly Malone
And her ghost wheels her barrow thro? streets broad and
narrow
Crying ?Cockles and mussels, alive, alive^oh.?
Repeat the last two lines, forte.
? Pronounce faver to rhyme with save ?er.


LORD WAKEHURST AT CORROBOREE
Our 1942 Christmas Corroboree was an important one in our history for it
marked the first occasion on which the Club was honoured by the presence of the
Governor of the State, in this case the Lord Wakehurst. On this splendid night,
described by our President as ??the high-water mark of Savagery, our guests
included the heads of the three fighting Services, Rear-Admiral G. C. Muirhead'
Gould, Major General A. C. Fewtrell, and Air Vice Marshall W. H. Anderson.
With the afterglow of this fine Corroboree still upon us we went into recess
until April, 1943, when the Ninth Annual Meeting was held. Once again we lost
our President to military duty, for Savage Badgery-Parker, who had succeeded in
joining up on the Army Education side, advised that he expected to be ?going north
at any time. He thanked the Savages for a ??memorable period of his life and one
which he would never forget.?
For the first and only occasion that I can recall there was a ballot for the
Presidency, aspirants being George Wilson and Bill Lewis. Voting was equal and
the retiring President was faced with the invidious task of deciding the issue by
his casting vote as provided for under the Constitution. His vote favoured George
Wilson, Bill Lewis in the true spirit of Savagery being the first to grasp his hand in
congratulation, manfully brushing aside what obviously must have been a great
disappointment to him.
BILL LEWIS
Programme Director 1937^1951.
Chairman of Council 1943-1951.
BILL LEWIS
Bill Lewis has been a grand Savage, having
played his part in many offices, always with
friendship and good humour. He filled the
exacting task of Chairman of the Programme
Committee for the record term of fourteen
years from 1937 to 1951, was also Chairman
of the Council from 1943 to 1951 and has
been Councillor and Brave ?which he still is
?as long as one can remember. Blulf, friendly,
cheerful, downright when necessary, Bill has
been one of the Club?s greatest stalwarts over
its whole life. The only time he?s missing is
for a couple of weeks every year when he?s
fishing?so he says ?with the Savage Winns
at Forster.
Bill hails from Melbourne and must have
been a Savage in his cradle (tough on his
mother) for he tells we that in 1904 he sang
at the Savage Club in Melbourne. He had a
fine baritone voice and was greatly sought after
at that time. The following incident that
occurred in 1910, is of interest.


IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
The Management regret to announce that Mr. PETER
DAWSON cannot fulfil his engagement to-night. Mr.
Dawson left Adelaide by Thursday?s express, but un-
fortunately the floods have held up the train at Murtoa since
Friday morning. Mr. W. E. LEWIS, the well-known
Baritone, will appear in the place of Mr. Dawson to-night,
and sing
1. "Aria from Don Carlos? - - - Verdi
2. "The Devout Lover? - - - M. V. White
3. "Father O?Flynn? - - - C. V. Stanford
Si- a Hnn at ?RT m 19 u 4 ?r when he had seen the H � ht and come to Sydney, he sang on
Ration 2BL on the first programme of any A Class Station in Australia, well-known
George Saunders being the announcer. A few years ago, Bill Lewis married Dome
nW? my �u lg u ndl / Ch , eer � h G,rls ? who dld 50 much to entertain the troops
World War I, and they live happily at Mosman-but he still gets out on Corroboree
nights.
Savage Jim Brunton Gibb agreed to carry on for 1943 as Chief Savage although
e too was now in uniform as Amenities Officer at the II 3th Australian General
wondeAu^pnrprf 01 " S f UC , Ceed ! n � war y ears he worked himself to a fraaale providing
? .i , amment or the many thousands of troops who were constantly
passing through this great establishment. He undoubtedly served his country in this
capacity just as effectively and courageously as he had done when a Digger in World
tK ""cl' ul JU i y ?- h W f Ver ? h , e , f � Und that the task was 50 onerous that in fairness to
the Club be decided he could not continue as Chief Savage and therefore asked to
be released from the The Savages, however, did not accept his resignation as
Chief Savage, but gave him leave of absence and other Savages, including Joe
Colhns and Frank Clewlow, acted as Chief Savage at the various Corroboreesuntil
the following year.
It was at this or the previous Annual Meeting that I made a faux pas. I was
reading the Minutes of the last Annual General Meeting; there is a certain stereotyped
verbiage about such routine procedure, but even so, as I went on reading I thought
to myself, these seem jolly familiar. I carried on and suddenly the dreadful fact hit
me: Id gathered up in error an extra copy of the previous year?s minutes and was
reading them (The minutes were on loose sheets for subsequent pasting into the
Minute Book.) I thought quickly. I looked around and no one seemed to be showing
any signs of perturbation? minutes are so boring, to Savages, anyway (There was
no hope of a dividend being declared.) I was nearly finished, so without blinking an
eyelid I went on to the bitter end and then looking around said, ?Well Savages those
were the wrong bloody minutes.? There were shouts of laughter and I felt almost
as good a comedian as Wally Baynes. I think they even gave me a ?Koora-na-boon ?
The correct ones were secured, confirmed and all was well, but still on such occasions
some of the old hands say sotto voce, Sure you?ve got the right minutes??

GEORGE WILSON
President 1943-1944.
GEORGE WILSON
Our new President, Savage George Wilson,
was in the newspaper world, on the executive
side of ?Smith?s Weekly?- that unique Aus-
tralian publication founded by Joynton Smith.
He was shortish and stocky in build and always
reminded me somewhat of Stanley Baldwin,
without the cherrywood, if possible to imagine
such a divorce. He sported a small bay-window
which in later years he has dispensed with,
under doctor?s orders, no doubt aided and
abetted by his medico son. He had a fatherly
I temperament and when speaking in his Presi-
dential capacity used to positively beam upon
his unruly bunch of Savages as if in fact the
wings, instead of the tails, were sprouting.
A friend of G. C. Codlin, of the ?Herald,?
one of the four signatories of the original
circular, George had been at the foundation
meeting so knew the Club from the ground
lloor up. He was a first-class organiser and
with the sporting association of his paper, had
over the years arranged many fine sports
events on our programmes.
I can remember we had a lot of fun
at one of the Luncheons this year when
Haigwood Masters, a phrenologist and vocational guidance expert, gave an address
with the rather awe-inspiring title of ?Does a Physiognomy Accurately Reveal Character
and Ability.? Having said his piece he started examining the craniums of various
Savages around the table to illustrate his points, starting with the President, George
Wilson. I forget what he told George he would be good at. I remember him
particularly commenting on the shape of his ears.
Colonel W. H. Mulholland, who was in charge of Army Education, and sub-
sequently became a Savage, gave a talk on ?The Soldier In To-morrow?s World,"
stressing the importance of keeping the many young lads who had gone into the
Army straight from school, in a frame of mind that was still absorptive to learning
so that when hostilities were over they would be better able to again take their places
in life. I think this work, scoffed at by many at the time as a new-fangled idea, has
undoubtedly paid dividends in the post-war world.
Together with so many thousands of ether organisations and groups of people,
the Club had undertaken the maintenance of a Prisoner-of-war by paying a pound a
week to the Red Cross Society and carried this on till the end of the war as a small
gesture to this grand cause. We actually had one of our own in Savage Capt. Ken
Moulton, who spent four interminable years in Japanese hands, but fortunately
returned to his homeland.
NEW NOMINATION PROCEDURE
In September, 1943, Council introduced a new procedure for the nomination
of members that rationalised certain aspects of former days which perhaps were a
little casual. Savages desiring to nominate a new member were now required, in the


first instance, to address a letter to the Hon. Secretary setting forth details of their
prospective candidate. This was considered by the Council and, if satisfactory, a
Preliminary Application Form was issued, which, on completion and return, was
investigated and read at two consecutive meetings of Council, after which a secret
ballot was taken. If clear, the details were then included in the monthly Notice
Paper for general scrutiny, and if no adverse comment was received, a Final Nomina'
tion Paper was issued to the Proposer. On completion, this again came before
Council for final consideration and approval.
This procedure has not been altered in any way since and still obtains tO'day.
By the observance of each step of this carefully thought out routine, possibility of
embarrassment is eliminated should Council decide in its initial consideration of a
projected nomination that the candidate may not measure up to the peculiar qualifica'
tions required in a Savage. Every new Savage on election receives a small folder
entitled, ?Qualifications, Privileges and Obligations of a Savage? for his guidance
and a copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Club.
NIGHT OF SAVAGE MEMORIES
A bright spot in the wanweary world of 1943 was the Night of Savage Memories
in September when we were able to assemble a number of Savages who had
contributed much in past years.
On the dais with President Savage George Wilson was Dick Havyatt, first
President, who was up from Melbourne where he now lives; Brave Alfred Hill, Jim
Brunton Gibb, many times Chief Savage, and Joe Collins, Chief Savage of the early
days who again officiated in this capacity, his effervescence and sprightliness having
been undimmed by the years between. Past Presidents Dr. William Wood and E. R.
Badgery'Parker couldn?t be with us owing to war service and apologies were also
received from Frank Hutchens, composer of the Savage Opening Ode and Past Chief
Savage Claude Flemming. Other early identities were ?Ned? Kelly, first Hon.
Auditor, Len Freeman, first Chief Steward, Eric Gordon, who had been in charge
of decorations for many years and Gordon Aickin, early Joint Hon. Secretary. All
those Savages present, who were at the first Corroboree on August 24th, 1934, were
given a rousing ?Kooramaffioon?.
Dick Havyatt told how the Club came to be formed and paid tribute to those
who had been prominent in its foundation and early history. Jim Brunton Gibb
in his remarks said: ?Friendships made in the Club have repaid me one hundred fold
for any efforts I have made in its interest.? Bill Wood in a letter echoed similar
sentiments. ?If I have given something to the Savage Club, I have gained immeasurably
in return.? Joe Collins spoke on the importance of keeping to the Club?s objectives
and not straying from our cultural associations. Alfred Hill spoke strongly, if
somewhat allegorically, on the same theme in an address on ?Tribal Matters,? both
these being quoted in Chapter XII.
IN DUTCH
At one of our 1943 Puncheons we had Dr. J. B. D. Pinnink, Consul General
of the Netherlands, as our speaker. In honour of the occasion Savage Leighton Lord,
an executive of the world'wide Philips electrical organisation the headquarters of which
is at Eindhoven, Holland, gave our Savage aboriginal welcome, ?Crana Crana,? in
Dutch which was received with great enthusiasm.
Here it is, with the English translation beside it.

THROUGH A VISITOR?S EYES
We think a lot of Savagery. We know what it is. What it means. It is always
difficult, however, to translate intangibles, like ideas, ideals and atmosphere, into
words. It was interesting, therefore, to have a view from the outside looking in when
one of our visitors who came along to the 1943 Christmas Corroboree thought fit to
put down his impressions. We were very interested and published his contribution
in Koora-na-hoon. I feel it is worthy of record.
A SAVAGE CHRISTMAS PARTY
By a Visitor
I have heard a lot about these Savage Club Corroborees and though invited
a number of times had never been able to spare a night to attend one until Friday
evening, December 7th. I now know what I?ve missed.
My host warned me ahead that he had a lot of little jobs to do and that I would
be handed over by him to fellow Savages who would see I was properly looked after.
We arrived in good time and on entering the meeting house I was immediately
impressed by the spirit of good fellowship which pervaded. In a few minutes, after
I had signed the Presence Book and received my badge, I started to meet people.
I pride myself on being a ?mixer? and here I was in my element for I was a ?mixer?
among ?mixers.? That little bit of pasteboard pinned on my lapel seemed to be
sufficient introduction to anyone in the room. I looked round and found I knew a
whole host of the Savages and their guests. Strange to relate they all seemed to be
blokes whom I always liked to meet either in business or socially. It seemed to be
as if someone had picked over my friends and acquaintances and collected a, couple
of hundred of the type of chaps I like to meet.


The atmosphere was there right at the start, and had we done nothing more than
mix and talk I would have had an enjoyable evening. Then a gong sounded and in
came the President Savage and official guests; Will Ashton, leader in the Art world;
Dick Boyer, a man of many parts, a grazier with a M.A. degree, member of the
A.8.C., and a big noise in international affairs; Eric Ashby, a Professor of Sydney
??Uni,"? who might easily be mistaken for a successful business man; lan Clunies Ross,
Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Sydney University, a much travelled
pedagogue who could be taken for a member of the diplomatic service.
I thought to myself Li These Savages can pick 'em.?
We all stood and sang the ?Opening Ode,? words of which increased my feeling
of anticipation of a pleasant evening. ?We praise the mind where reason shines.?
That accounted for the presence of the University Professors on the dais and ?The
patient hand of Art??well, Will Ashton was art?s representative. ?The lips that
love to taste of love and wine and laughter,? that?s where a whole host of the good
fellows around me came in.
The crowning of the President Savage and official guests with typically ?Savage?
forehead bands was a nice touch exhibiting a fine sense of creation of atmosphere.
Acting Chief Savage Joe Collins, himself donned a mask and referred to a ?Black?
Christmas only to be flatly contradicted that ?Black? was wrong, ?Savage? was the
word. Whereupon Savages and guests burst into a chorus, the tune of which I
have heard Bing Crosby sing ad nauseum. I found a typed slip with these words on
the table and realised this was the unconventional manner in which Savages were
wishing us all the compliments of the Season.
Here is what we all sang heartilly?
SAVAGE CHRISTMAS
(Sung to the tune of ?White Christmas?)
Savages now bid a bright Christmas
To all the friends and guests we know;
With the Gunyah running, and voices humming,
Though the grog supply is very low;
We?re here to celebrate Christmas,
Upon this bright Corroboree night;
And with story, song and tune so bright,
May all your Christmasses come right.
D-DAY
Nineteen forty Tour may be described as a ?Year of Destiny? in the history of
civilisation and of the fortunes of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
The war situation had materially changed and instead of taking it we were
dishing it out. There was a, feeling of optimism in the air and feverish talk of the
opening of the Second Front, and wild speculation as to when D-Day would fall.
With the successful landing on the coast of Normandy on June 6th, 1944, the
downfall of the Hitler regime was beyond doubt.
As it so happened our monthly Luncheon was on June 7th, 1944, the day after
the Normandy landing. Bill Lewis was in the chair and speaking with emotion he

asked those assembled to let their minds dwell on our kinsmen in the battle front.
It will be remembered that in spite of all the meteorological experts predicting good
conditions, the weather proved unexpectedly cussed and General Eisenhower ) as
Supreme Commander, had to make the fateful decision whether to proceed or to
postpone the great invasion armada. His courageous decision now belongs to history,
but with gales battering the vast invasion fleet and the cumbersome ?Mulberry
Harbours,? things were very critical at this hour.
We all stood for a minute in silent prayer.
MEMBERSHIP LIMITED
Whether the elation engendered by action at last was infectious, I don?t know,
but strange to say we had a great influx of new members at this period, some forty
joining between the 1943 and 1944 Annual Meetings. This resulted in both catering
and accommodation difficulties. The Coronet was becoming overcrowded and with
austerity regulations, catering was a problem. The scarcity of beer was, of course,
chronic. Subsequently, in the light of our experience at the Grace Auditorium, which
except on special nights, was too big for us, we have come to learn that it is better
to be overcrowded at a Corroboree than to have too much room. At this neriod when
we were packing them into the Coronet virtually like sardines, there was, however,
some dissatisfaction in certain quarters. Consequently, after careful consideration by
Council, it was decided that the membership would be limited as from March 13th,
1944. All prospective members, other than those in the Artist''Member category,
had their names entered on a waiting list, which was reviewed from time to time in
the light of resignations or deaths. This waiting list carried on for several years.

NEVILLE CARDUS
The one and only Neville Cardus who is continually running backwards and
forwards following either musicians or cricketers, spoke to us in June, 1943. Wearing
his Savage Club tie, his address was couched in similar vein to many of his musical
criticisms; full of wit and sprinkled with barbed comment. Looking around the
gathering he quickly spotted Warwick Armstrong, one of Australia?s leading cricketers
of former years and a most wily skipper, who was along with Savage Jim Armstrong.
Forty years ago I first saw Warwick in a Test Match at Old Trafford,? said Cardus.
In those days I was partisan but now I look for Art. He was young then and did
not look like a human-being?no Australian cricketer in the field ever looks like a
human-being?l could have killed him with a look. I count Warwick an honorary
Savage, he said, ?he gives me great pleasure and great annoyance.?
HAROLD WILLIAMS
President, 1944-1946.
Speaking of the musical side of his life
he went on: ?I recall James Agate, who was
once dramatic critic of the Manchester Guardian,
like many others, used to write criticisms
before going to the show. I used to do that at
first but thought it wasn?t honest and that?s why
no-one gets a good notice. Whatever happens,
I get hated, so why worry. That?s why I like
the Savage Club, in it you can say what you
like. If a Savage insults you it shows that he
likes you.?
Another luncheon address of particular
current interest was given by Damien Parer,
official photographer with the A.I.F. who, after
two years in the Middle East filming the Libyan
and Syrian campaigns, returned to Australia
and was sent to New Guinea where he used to
live. He walked over the Owen Stanley Range
to Wau to find his father?s hotel deserted and
the huge gold dredges that had been flown in
piece by piece and assembled, idle and rusting.
He summed up the Jap?s method of warfare in
New Guinea in two words?camouflage and
deception. He will stand motionless for hours
to get a shot which will be successful. He will
snipe from a tree, to which he ties himself;
yell; let off fire crackers and call our orders in
English. This fighting is nerve-wracking and
he said he had seen seasoned troops in the pink
of condition, veterans of the Middle East, re-
duced in four days to haggard and exhausted wrecks. It was the awful tension
of not knowing where the enemy was that told on them more than the physical
effort. These lines, written in a foxhole near Lae by Pte. R. S. Harris, 33 Btn., A.1.F.,
capture this dreadful suspense.


WAITING
Waiting in a foxhole in the jungle damp and dense,
Waiting, waiting, waiting?oh, that bloody long suspense,
Nothing going to happen? Yet you hear most eerie sounds,
And, unconsciously, you feel to see the mag. is charged with
rounds.
Waiting, as the daylight fades to dark and frightening night;
Waiting, waiting, waiting ?will the b ?t ?d come and fight?
A million thoughts run through your mind; as quick as light
they roam,
Predominant is when, and if, you?ll see the folks back home.
Waiting as the archie sends a barrage overhead;
Waiting, waiting, waiting ??Come on, Jap., and get my lead.
Damien was a cousin of Ray Parer who, with Macintosh, flew an old "crate,?
mended with fencing wire from England to Australia after World War I. He was
killed later in the Pacific war in action at his job.
The Tenth Annual Meeting was held in April, 1944,
and our new President was Harold Williams, Savage
George Wilson, whose health was not the best, deciding
that he would not stand again. We were all delighted
to have Harold as our President, for not only was he
an artist of world eminence but he was a real Savage
in every sense of the word. There was nothing of the
namby-pamby artiste about him. He loved cricket and
golf, grog and gag and was a real man?s man.
Jimmy Brunton Gibb was prevailed upon to carry
on as Chief Savage, and Harold and Jim, friends dating
back to the days when as youths they served in World
War I, formed a wonderful partnership, and the next
two years were very happy and successful ones for the
Club. The exodus overseas of so many of our leading
artist members had not as yet commenced and with the
stimulating presence of Harold who was so generous
with his talent, we enjoyed some of our finest pro-
grammes.
DR. BAINTON?S OPERA
DR. EDGAR BAINTON
Director, N.S.W. State
Conservatorium of Music,
19340947.
The May Corroboree was an historic one for it witnessed the rendition of
excerpts from Dr. Edgar Bainton?s new opera "The Pearl Tree,? with the composer
at the piano and President Harold Williams as soloist. Leading members of the
Opera Orchestra, Willie Krasnik (violin) and Gladstone Bell (?cello) subsequently
combined with Frank Hutchens at the piano in a Beethoven trio.
Dr. Bainton at this time was celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of his appoint'
ment as Director of the State Conservatorium of Music and during the season


of his opera, a bust in terra cotta by sculptor Dr. Arthur Fleischmann on the wall of
the Conservatorium Hall was unveiled by the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, as a
permanent record of his fine work.
It was appropriate at this time when the Club was enjoying such a high level
in its musical life that one who had been so insistent that nothing but the best was
good enough for the Savage Club should be honoured by Life Membership. I refer
to Alfred Hill, who in thanking the Council for the honour, modestly said, ?I set
out to do so much, and feel a fraud when the little I have accomplished has been so
handsomely rewarded. Ever grateful, Alfred Hill.?
Another magnificent night was at the August 1944 Corroboree, when Harold
Williams and Stanley Clarkson sang together ?The Lord is a Man of War.? It was
a performance, said John O?Donnell, in ?Koora-na-boon,? that might well have been
staged in the Albert Hall with their Majesties in the Royal Box. As a sequel, and
illustrating the remarkable range of his magnificent voice, Harold then announced
that he and Stan would sing ?Watchman, What of the Night? without a tenor.
Harold sang every note as written.
There was nothing of the condescending high-brow about Harold and at many
of the Corroborees he used to have us all singing merry choruses of which, as
already mentioned, the favourite was ?Cockles and Mussels.? He also delighted us
when he rendered ?II Duce.? We had first heard it from Charlie Lawrence in 1941
and when he said he was quoting it from Quentin Reynold?s best seller, ?A London
Diary, ? we thought that he was ?having us on.?
Here are the words. Harold supplied the tune and the Savages the boisterous
finale.
IL DUCE
II Duce gave the order to march against the foe,
And off to Ethiopia the organ-grinders go;
And now they are unfitted for any kind of grind,
For they?re back from Ethiopia with their organs left behind.
The hosts of Ethiopia return to hearth and home,
With knick-knacks for the mantlepiece imported straight from
Rome;
The Pope is inundated with pleas to join the choir
From men whose normal voices are now an octave higher.
II Duce mounts the rostrum when the regiments return
With an unknown soldier?s ashes in a noble Roman urn;
?For some great gift of gratitude this great occasion calls,
What shall we give our heroes?? And the heroes answered
?Turn -te-tum.?


CULTURE IN MODERN times has been a much abused word.
So much so that one almost hesitates to use it for fear of being
regarded as a highTalutin high'brow. What we in the Club
understand by this term is the pursuit of those aspects of human
endeavour referred to in our objectives?literature, art, music,
the drama, the sciences, original research and discovery.
CHAPTER XII
CULTURE AND THE CLUB
Over the years our leaders have never allowed these
objectives to be forgotten, for we know only too well that it would be possible, by
apathetic laisse2,'faire or even by active disregard of these basic ideals, for the Club
to become just another social club and our Corroborees to degenerate into mere
smoke concerts.
Harold Williams has always been most insistent in this acknowledgment of our
true tenets and in his first message in ?KooramaToon? on assuming the Presidency
he emphasized that the Savage Club has an important role to play in the future of
Australia. ?As its President, I wish to stress the Club?s task in development and
encouragement of the cultural side of our National Life. I therefore commend to
members the following Editorial which appeared in the Sydney ?Sun? on Monday,
22nd May, 1944:?
?THE PLACE OF THE ARTS?
?It may be an unfamiliar thought to many that the premiere of Dr. Bainton?s
ooera in Sydney on Saturday was at least as important an event as the winning of
a Test Match or a Melbourne Cup.
?Nevertheless that is the fact.
"A nation?s prestige depends in history upon the culture which its material
and military strength uphold.
?The bust survives the Throne; the coin, Tiberius.
?By industry, a nation exists, by valour it survives, by Art it learns how to live.
Thus a fine poem, picture, or opera has full pride of place in a Nation?s story. The
glories of ancient Greece were those of her artists and poets. Germany, as a nation,
became decadent when she forgot Bach and Beethoven, and worshipped Krupp.
?Italy?s great ?Risorgimento? of the fourteenth Century made her truly great
again because of the names of artists who will never die. Her recent ?Risorgimento,?
because it laid emphasis on material things, gave the world only the names of a
few posturing politicians, and has brought her, temporarily, into the dust.
?Verdi, writer of operas, meant more in prestige to Italy than Mussolini.
?Let us in Australia, then, spare a thought from war, politics, sport and
industrial grievances for art.
?We will be better and happier people for such a thought.?
In pursuance of this theme Savage Frank Clewlow, Director of Drama, Aus'
tralian Broadcasting Commission, gave a splendid Luncheon address on ?Art?s Place
in the Brave New World.? He used these verses by W. E. Henley as the text in
his plea for development and revival of culture.


Hr
IN A GOLDEN FOG
A large, fulbstomached faith in kindliness
All over the world, the nation, in a dream
Of money and love and sport, hangs at the paps
Of welbbeing, and so
Goes fattening, mellowing, dozing, rotting down
Into a rich deliquin of decay.
AND IN THE WILD HOURS
A people, roaring ripe
With victory, rises, menaces, stands renewed
Sheds its old piddling aims,
Approves its virtue, puts behind itself
The comfortable dream, and goes,
Armoured and militant,
New'pithed, new'souled, newwisioned, up the steeps
To those great altitudes, whereat the weak
Live not. But only the strong
Have leave to strive, and suffer, and achieve.
FRANK CLEWLOW.
From time to time other Savages have enunciated the Savage credo as they
saw it and this was particularly in evidence at the Night of Savage Memories in
September, 1943. This, perhaps, was very natural for it could be said to> represent
a sort of cultural stocktaking after nearly ten years of Savage trading.
Jo� Collins summed up the character and objectives clearly and concisely: u We
all feel that the Sydney Savage Club has its own job to do in the community; other
clubs have their characters, their particular objectives, but the Sydney Savage Club
is unique. Its joh is otic which only tnuc Sewages can do: we have its mam object
always before us. 'To promote social intercourse and good fellowship amongst men
interested in literature, art, music, the drama, the sciences, original research or
discovery. Let us by all means have our fun, but at the same time let us see to it
that the Sydney Savage Club plays its part in the advancement of the arts and
sciences among whose practitioners we seek to promote social intercourse and good
fellowship.?
Alfred Hill has always been a very sensitive barometer of our cultural climace
and if he thought we were veering off course, one could always expect a good blow.
On this Night of Memories he wrapped it up in a bit of allegory and mystery
but the sting was well and truly in the tail. No one is more knowledgeable in the
culture and tradition of the Maori than Alfred, in whose folkdore and music he
is so well versed. The following is the substance of his fine address which he
kindly wrote out in his meticulous hand for John O?Donnell to publish in
"KooramaToon.?
TRIBAL MATTERS
By Savage Alfred Hill
Let us talk together of tribal matters.
In the olden days, it was not permitted for ordinary members of the tribe to
know of the most sacred lore and powers of the chiefs, but these degenerate days
demand that we should recall our great past.
The blasting of a tree, or the killing of a man by projection of thought was
part of the education of a higlvborn chief. The powers of telepathy are known


even to the Pakeha (stranger) of to-day. They know that serious shock may be
experienced by the receipt of a ?message? from a loved one, often as the result of
a fatal accident. The message may be consciously or unconsciously received, but
the resultant shock may even cause death. We Savages have long understood
these ?mysteries.?
Our old chants, which are in danger of being lost and forgotten played a very
important part in savage life. You will recall that at the birth of our great demi-god
Maui, some careless or timid singer broke the continuity of the birth-song and so
was lost the secret of eternal life on earth. In some songs we heard the spirit voice.
The Pakeha would tell us that they were just overtones ?but we know better. Our
flute-songs were songs played on the flute and at the same time the player mouthed
the words of the song as he played. Sometimes the words were in a secret language.
On at least one memorable occasion a savage, taken in battle, saved his life in
this remarkable manner. Being permitted to play (on his flute) his Death-Song,
he used this secret-language to plot with his friends (who were hidden in the fern)
his escape. He stood, as he played, on a high rock overlooking the lake. As he
finished his last note he fell backwards into the waters below and swam to a friendly
canoe which took him to safety.
Control over the natural forces was practiced by the Tohungas. A friend of
mine recounted the following story. Being anxious to learn more of the powers
of a certain very old seer, he asked to become a pupil. The old man told him
that it would serve no useful purpose, but if he like, he would show him some
trifling thing. He told my friend to go down to the river and fetch him the largest
stone he could carry. Having done this the Tohunga said ?now bring me a branch
of the Karamu tree.? When he received it the strange old man began to chant
?Whaka rongo e te rau,? etc., and the stone slowly crumbled to dust. ?No, my
friend said, ?I was not hypnotised. It just happened.?
You have heard me mention the birth of Maui. You remember it was this
great Man-god who fished our land from the sea, and descended into the bowels
of the earth to discover fire. His old ancestress amused him by getting fire by
pulling off her nails, until with the last big toe-nail she set the world ablate. Maui
had to turn himself into a bird to escape the heat. Many more of Maui?s adventures
could I tell, but you have heard enough to draw a comparison between the past and
the present.
I have chided the Chiefs and Elders of many tribes because the children did
not know their native tongue, could not sing the tribal songs, and were ignorant of
the name of their ancestral canoe.
Now Savages heed me well.
Project your thoughts, straight and keen ?not to kill, but to rebuild our
glorious Savage past. The Pakeha has come amongst us, and by the power of his
gold, foisted on our people bad custom, bad art, bad music and bad living. All
these damnable things have crept into our Corroborees.
The Chiefs are with us.
Bare then your limbs for the fight!
Tear down the false gods!
Spit on the enemy!
Taunt him to fight, not with gold but with his bare hands and limbs so that you
can tear him apart!
Ake! Ake! Ake! Kia Kaha!
Ake! Ake! Ha !


t
LADIES? NIGHT PROGRAMME, 1944
Drawing by John Frith.


TWO SAVAGES WHO were to play important parts in the

Lindley Evans and John Frith. Lindley, who has for so long
occupied a unique position as one of Australia?s leading musicians,
was to become Club President. John, Australia?s eminent car-
toonist and a lad if ever there was one, was to be responsible

DR. THOMAS WOOD
Perhaps the most famous character to visit our gunyah at this time was Dr.
Thomas Wood, author of that splendid book ?Cobbers,? which did so much to
explain the Australian outlook and way of life to the world. He said ?thank you?
in a unique fashion??

THOMAS WOOD.
25th November, 1944.
Although he has now passed on, his happy and understanding nature lives
on in his books.
This was a most fruitful neriod and at almost every Corroboree we had
interesting folk from many walks of life. Thus in April 1944 there was Harry
Watt, producer of those films that stirred us so, ?Target for To-night,? and that
unique picture that surely will go down in history, ?London Can Take It.? He
enjoyed himself thoroughly and wrote in the Club Diary:


I can?t spell Corroboree!
I don?t know what it means!
I can?t pronounce Koora-na-boon!
But they?re a hell of a lot of fun!
Thanks a lot. HARRY WATT.
An outstanding personality who spoke to us in 1944 on ?Wartime China?? was
Professor Chau, head of the Chinese Information set-up in Australia. He was quite
a character and at that time we were, of course, full of admiration for our Chinese
allies, and the present situation had not arisen. In a letter of thanks he wrote:
Dear Members of the Savage Club,
In my talk last Wednesday I think I was a bit
?savageous?? in my critique of Western civilisation, but
judging from the welcome and applause I received, I came to
the happy conclusion that you could take it. I sincerely hope
that East and West can strive together for the establishment
of ?One Family under Heaven.?? (Four Chinese characters
followed).
I thank you for your hospitality,
K. L. CHAU,
Director in Australia,
Ministry of Information,
Republic of China.
April 14th, 1944.
One wonders where he is to-day and what colour his heaven is.
Jack Strong, who had told us four years before how London had met the war,
had been Home again and this time, in a talk entitled ?The Courage of London,?
recounted something of the manner in which our kinsfolk had met everything that
Hitler could throw at them with courage and determination and were now starting
well and truly to hurl it back with compound interest.
MARJORIE LAWRENCE
Marjorie Lawrence was in Australia towards the end of 1944 and we felt we
wanted to do something to express our appreciation of her and our admiration of
her courage. The means we chose were, I think, novel and were obviously deeply
appreciated. At her concert at the Town Hall on September 20th, 1944, we
presented her with a boomerang and the following verse:
MISS MARJORIE LAWRENCE
Bill Lewis.
Upon the stage she sits, just like a flamin? Queen;
A vision fair??er ?air a golden sheen.
More golden still ?er Voice, that thrills the mob,
An? makes each Savage breast with rapture throb.
Wagnerian songs she sings just like a pro.
Of French an? Dago tunes she makes a ?oly show.
She ?as us fair enthralled with ?er Brunhilda ?
But blimey! When she sings ?Waltzing Matilda! !??
With Apologies to ?The Sentimental Bloke.??


The message continued:
This Boomerang we now pass on to you. As the Boomerang
returns to the thrower, we pray to The Great Spirit that
you may return to us again, well and strong, to inspire us
with your unconquerable will, and charm us with your Divine
singing. As token of our Love?and fond Adieux.
The next day President Harold Williams received this letter:
Dear Mr. Williams,
Thank you and the members of the Sydney Savage Club
for that most thoughtful gesture in sending the boomerang
and the Koorama-boon to me during my concert at the Town
Hall last night. I shall be proud to add it to my collection
and will put it on display in my country home in America.
Sorry I could not be a guest at your Club ?next time I
hope. My husband, Dr. King, enjoyed very much his meeting
with you all.
My best wishes to the Savage Club.
Sincerely yours,
The Australia Hotel, MARJORIE LAWRENCE.
September 21st, 1944.
Bill Lewis was also thanked in a letter of his own 'Tor your kind thoughtfulness
in writing me such a lovely letter, and for your delightful poem.?
Her hunsband, Dr. Thomas King, as mentioned, had been along to a Corroboree
and we admired his quiet dignity and the way in which he was devoting his life to
help his wife in her wonderful fight against a cruel blow of fate.
LADIES? NIGHT AGAIN
After D'Day and the initial critical days were over, optimism was in the air
so much so that it was decided that it would be appropriate to revive the Annual
Ladies? Night which had been suspended in 1940. This was done on Friday, August
2nh, 1944, at the Grace Auditorium. Five hundred attended and the whole of the
proceeds went to the Red Cross Prisoner'of-War Fund.
Although I understand the London Club does not go in for Ladies? Nights?
preferring to keep its portals sacrosanct from the savage female?the Sydney Savages
rather enjoy this one night in the year when the lubras come amongst us. We
usually celebrate the event with a humorous slant, our new Savage John Frith
doing the honours on this occasion. Several of the best of these \adies? Night
drawings by various Savage artists are reproduced through these pages.
The programme, a wartime model in duplicated form, was couched in C. J.
Dennis jargon and as we had not had one for four years I will quote it:
SAVAGE HAROLD WILLIAMS?PRESIDENT
The ?ead Serang! The Savage Tribal Boss!
He makes his ongtray like a blooming Joss.
The Tribesmen?s Moon-eyed Lubras then he?ll greet
And welcome them ?and kid them up a treat

But when ?e sings?the world is well forgot!

?BLOODY DANKS?
The ?S.S.C. Broadcast? refers to the playlet put on by Savages Frank Clewlow,
Lou Vernon, Frank Harvey and Miss Ida Osbourne, which brought the house down.
Enjoying the choice title of ?Bloody Danks? it was in fact, so Frank told us in his
introductory remarks, a play that had been submitted by some hopeful playwrite in
all seriousness to tht A.B.C. He felt, to use his own words, it was so bad that it
would make a splendid item for Ladies? Night. It certainly did.
It was a melodrama, embodying a bloodthirsty bushranger, pursued by mounted
policemen, who abducts a ?good woman? whose pure faith causes a last minute
change of heart in the dastardly villain and so saves her life and her honour. The
curtain is rung down as he is led away and she, with uplifted eyes, piously opines
that ?there?s a little bit of goodness in us all.? The Savage actors let their hair
down, and it was quite the funniest thing we have ever had, so much so that ?Bloody
Danks? has become quite a tradition in the Club; in fact, for the benefit of some of
the newer members it was revived with some other players at a more recent Ladies'
Night, and went over with equal success.


C''�yWjk W^A%,

?FRITHY?
by himself.
?FRITHY?
Savage John Frith was also on the bill with his lightning
sketches and cartoons. ?Frithy,? as he is generally known,
would be a personality wherever he went. At this stage he
was on ?The Bulletin? and subsequently became the daily
cartoonist of the Sydney Morning Herald until, in 1950, much
to our dismay and loss, he went to Melbourne. Not only is
he probably Australia?s outstanding cartoonist, when it comes
to pure skill in delineation and paucity of line, but he has the
uncanny knack of always pinpointing the topic of the day
in his drawing.
He was a wonderful raconteur and when giving an item would invariably walk
slowly to the dais, take off his coat, leisurely roll up his sleeves, and with that
humorous twinkling in his eye commence his turn with telling us a few stories,
many of which were outrageously funny but not recordable, interspersed with
references to the Bulletin ?Price sixpence, published every Wednesday. He
possessed remarkable skill in capturing likenesses of people which he proved time
and time again at our various Corroborees when guests or members were called to
the dais and in a few seconds and with a few lines, he had them as others saw them,
sometimes doubtless to their secret dismay but to the delight of the onlookers.
One of his most famous efforts, which was called for practically every time,
was his short-sighted doctor, and the manner in which he put the finishing touch
to this sketch of a medico examining a pretty patient in a rather unorthodox manner,
always caused convulsions.
Apart from these humorous aspects, this programme also gives some idea of the
wealth of vocal talent that was in the Club at that time; Savages Harold Williams,
Stanley Clarkson, Arnold Matters, John Fullard and Breach Riley, with Bill Herbert
from the Melbourne Savage Club. With the exception of Harold Williams, John
Fullard and Breach Riley, who are again back in Sydney,
all the others have been in London for some years where
they hold high the banner of Australia in the musical
world. When in London in 1949 I met Bill Herbert,
who is a popular member of the Savage Club, and we
had dinner together. He is a most sought'aftcr singer.
GOVERNOR AN HONORARY SAVAGE
In 1937 an approach had been made to Government
House in respect of Vice' Regal Patronage, but it had
been very rightly pointed out that establishment and
standing had to be attained before such matters could
be considered. Popular Len Robb, Official Government
House Secretary, at our request accepted Honorary
Membership and has been a jolly figure at many
Gorroborees over the years. With his equally jolly
wife I don?t think he?s ever missed a Ladies? Night.
The war years intervened, and it was not till 1944
that we again made overtures to Government House
with the desire for Lord Wakehurst to become Patron
of the Club. We were advised that if established
practice should be that a club of this character came

within the category of organisations which usually received Vice' Regal Patronage, it
would receive favourable consideration. Should, however, this not prove to be the
case, the Governor had indicated that he would accept Honorary Membership. In
due course we were informed that Patronage was not possible, and so the alternative
was implemented to our considerable satisfaction. This took place at the 1944
Christmas Corroboree, when we were honoured for the second time with the presence
of The Governor of N.S.W., John de Vere Baron Wakehurst, who, on this occasion,
was formally inducted into the Club as an Honorary Savage, receiving his badge from
the hands of the President, Harold Williams.
OUR CARTOONISTS
Our Savage Artists and Cartoonists went to town on the Programme for this
very important occasion. Joe Collins did the cover, depicting a huge emu with its
neck stretched over a rock, father abo vigorously attacking it with a stone axe while
the piccaninnies desperately hang on to its biting and kicking extremities. (See
page 108.) Inside he had a grinning abo. in Father Christmas attire holding on high
a brimming'over tankard. (See page 48.) Beneath was the Toast:
?Here?s to a Happy Christmas and to the fulfilment of the hopes for our
Victory in arms and for wisdom in "The Peace?.?
""The Initiation? drawing was by Savage Jim Russell showing Chief Savage Jim
Brunton Gibb painting His Excellency on his manly chest with Savage "'striped

is saying ""Too plurry right, King Harold! Dis feller been plenty big warrior before,

Savage Les Dixon did the sequel, ?After the Initiation,? in which the new
Savage is heaving boomerangs with such vigour that all are ducking for cover. He
is saying, ?What?s the matter with you Braves? This is supposed to be a SAVAGE
Club!?
The final drawing was by Savage Jim Bancks, and had a topical background.
It is an artist?s studio and upon the easel is an extenuated looking figure reminiscent
of the famous controversial Joshua Smith Archibald Prise portrait. H.E. is saying,
?Mr. Dobell, I hope that you will soon finish this chap and start on me.? Bill
Dobell replies, ?But your Excellency, This is You.? It will be remembered that
about this time Bill Dobell was commissioned to paint portraits of both Lord and
Lady Wakehurst.
We are fortunate in having all these original drawings preserved in our records
and reproduce them on these pages.
The programme embraced Savages Harold Williams, Les Levante, Frank
Clewlow, Ellis Troughton, John Fullard, John Frith, Lou Vernon, Jim Bancks,
Frank Harvey, Bob Payne and Mr. Neville Amadio, accompanists being Savages
Horace Keats, Dick Thew and Clarrie Black. What a terrific bill: no wonder our
new Vice'Re gal Savage didn?t want to go home. Savage Monte Luke took some
splendid photos of this Corroboree, sets of which were presented to Lord Wakehurst
and sent to the Savage Club in London. Unfortunately we were soon to lose our
new Savage who returned to England in 1945. Before he went we presented him
with one of our bronze Honour Plaques.
Apart from the great activity and success on the artistic side it was also a busy
period for the executive and several important developments were initiated. Firstly
the Savage Club Scholarship was inaugurated as a direct result of our drive to more
forcibly pursue the cultural side of the Club?s influence. (See Chapter XVI).
A determined effort to secure and finance Club premises was also made as
mentioned earlier in reference to the inauguration of the Building Fund in 1939. The
Club Diary was started by Joe Collins with the purpose of keeping together all
letters, programmes, sketches, photographs and publications appertaining to the
Club. This excellent idea, from my point of view as the Club?s biographer, was
thought of just ten years too late, though what has been done has proved of
,considerable assistance in compiling this record. Jack Lee took over from foe and
carried on for several years, and since then Bob Thompson and Bill Brown have
assisted. It really is remarkable, scanning the pages, how interesting such a record
becomes and how essential it is, for one forgets so much as the years fly by.
I also prepared the First Annual Report comprehensively covering the year?s
activities, which was presented at the Annual Meeting. Similar reports have been
collated ever since and members enjoy hearing this recapitulation of the year?s
operations, the general reaction being surprise that in a quiet way we have done so
much.
Lastly, but by no means the least important of our efforts, was the Food For
Britain Campaign that was pursued vigorously. (See Chapter XIV.)

Sketch by Jim Bancks from the Souvenir Programme, Christmas 1944.


WINSTON CHURCHILL,
THE EMPIRE'S CHIEF SAVAGE.
VICTORY CORROBOREE
And so we arrive at the
Victory year of 1945, and on May
25 th we held a Corroboree to
celebrate VE Day. A souvenir
programme was produced bearing
a portrait of Winston Churchill,
with his bulldog look and cigar,
by Savage Jim Russell and bear-
ing the words: ?Koora-na-boon to
Winston Churchill, The Empire?s
'Chief Savage?.? Beneath was
the Toast of VE Day, which in
the unavoidable absence of
Harold Williams was presented
by Past President William Wood.
"Brother Savages, I give you
the Toast ?VE E)ay.
"As Loyal British Savages we
must be ever mindful of our
fealty to our King, who stands
for all that is best in the World
to-day, but to-night we particu-
larly want to honour one of the

history. VE Day is a day in-
separable from the name of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of Great Britain,
whom I like to think of as the Empire?s Chief Savage. His vision, inspiring leadership,
nobility of mind and unfailing good humour have brought us safely through the
years of darkness. May he be long spared to enjoy the fruits of final and complete
victory over our one remaining common enemy. I ask you to give him 'Koora-na-
boon? with much gusto.?
John Frith was Acting Chief Savage ?for one night only,? so read the caption
under a little sketch of himself by himself, showing the long nose and curlywig
moustache which is such a characteristic of his cartoons. The programme consisted
''of Stanley Clarkson, Arnold Matters, Ereach Riley, Jim Bancks, Leo Cherniavsky,
Adrian Button, George Sorley, Harry Abdy and Syd Clarke. The heads of the
three fighting Services ?Rear-Admiral G. D . Moore, Major General E. C. P. Plant
and Air Commodore L. A. V. Lachal, were present as our official guests as well as
Eric Kennedy, Editor of ?The Sun? and Sir Alfred Davidson, General Manager of
the Bank of New South Wales.
Copies of the Victory Corroboree programme were sent to the Savage Clubs
in London, Melbourne and New Zealand and also to Winston Churchill himself.
We received the following reply from the House of Commons, written in h i ?s own
hand: ?I thank vou sincerely for your verv kind message to me which I have
received and read with pleasure. Winston S. Churchill. 1945.?
We also held a Victory Special Ladies? Night in August, 1945. President Harold
Williams in greeting our Lubras with Koora-na-boon, said: ?At the Victory
Corroboree it is most appropriate that our Ladies should share our jubilation. To
them we give a great welcome?may everyone enjoy the Victory Spirit?let joy
he unbounded.?

It is very unusual for us
to have ladies on our pro-
gramme, even on Ladies?
Night, but this year was an
?exception, and we included
charming little pianist Marie
Van Hove, our first scholarship
winner; and Esme, the talented
daughter of Savage magician
Les Levante who, with her
father, put on a first-class
telepathy act. Les?the Great
Levante ?has been a Savage
for many years and has de-
lighted us with his finished
performances time and time
again. After a lifetime of
activity in his profession he
keeps deciding to retire but
this never lasts long as the

Savages Les Levante (with button-hole) and Bill Moloney

the road wins again and he forms a new company and is off once more. At present
he?s in England with Esme in his company and is having his usual success. If by
some confusion in the records, Les ever turns up at the Pearly Gates, Peter will have
to watch out for his halo for Les is sure to snitch it for his famous ring trick which
always baffles us.
THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER
H.R.H. The Duke of Gloucester had recently arrived in Australia to become
Governor' General of the Commonwealth. We hastened to prepare an Address of
Welcome and Loyalty and the President and myself presented this at the formal
function arranged for the receipt of such addresses on March 12th, 1945, at
Admiralty House, Sydney.
The following reply was received from His Royal Highness:
THE SYDNEY SAVAGE CLUB
I thank you very much indeed for the loyal Address of Welcome which you have
presented on behalf of the member of the Sydney Savage Club.
It gives me the greatest pleasure to have returned to Australia, and to have assumed
my duties as Governor-General of the Commonwealth. This time I bring with me
my wife, the Duchess, and our two small sons to live among you.
I am sure that we shall all enjoy our stay in this pleasant land among your
hospitable and kind people.
I send your Club my very best wishes for the future.
12th March, 1945. (Signed) HENRY.
Prior to leaving London, he had been entertained at the Savage Club at an
Australia Day Luncheon, Sir Charles McCann, South Australia?s Agent' General,
being in the Chair.
The Eleventh Annual Meeting was held in April, 1945, Savage Harold Williams
and Jim Brunton Gibb carrying on as President and Chief Savage respectively.
The Annual Report recorded that our membership had risen to 258 and as we were
still having space trouble, and at one Corroboree 100 Savages and 140 guests came
along, it was decided that we would have to limit guests to one per Savage. This
limitation continued for several years until we moved again.


HORACE KEATS MEMORIAL CONCERT
Nineteen Forty-five saw what was perhaps our most ambitious undertaking
before or since. It was the Horace Keats Memorial Concert arranged and conducted
by the Sydney Savage Club at the Sydney Town Hall.
Savage Horace Keats, who had been with us for a number of years and was a
most talented accompanist as well as a composer of distinction, died very suddenly.
As soon as this tragic news was known, a Committee was formed to organise the
Sydney Savage Club Horace Keats Memorial Fund, and a Memorial Concert was
held at the Town Hall on November 7th, 1945. This was an outstanding success
and as the result of the proceeds therefrom, together with donations from Savages,
a cheque for �7OO was handed to the Rural Bank of N.S.W. on Mrs. Keats? behalf,
thereby reducing the mortgage on her home to that extent.
Savage John O?Donnell was in his element and enthusiastically handled all
the organisation, while we had splendid co-operation from everybody, particularly
the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Percy Code and the A.B.C. Orchestra
who gave their services, as did Neville Amadio, Frank Hutchens, John Fullard,
Bindley Evans, Sylvia Fisher and Harold Williams.
Jack Musgrove gave a luncheon at the Trocadero and Mr. Eric Burnett, A.B.C.
Concert Manager, made his services available as Honorary Concert Manager. The
first half of the programme was broadcast and we all felt that Club had done
rather well in this worthy cause.
LYNDON DADSWELL
We were pleased during this period to welcome to the Club Lyndon Dadswell,
who is to-day Australia?s leading sculptor. He very generously gave to the Club
a particularly fine aboriginal head which he had modelled. Life-size, with tousled
nair tied back with a headband, knotted beard and deeply sunken eyes, it portrays
splendidly the best type of Australian aboriginal. It soon became affectionately
known as ??Daddy.?
During the war years we had wanted to have a new badge designed but had to
postpone it. When Lyndon came along he was the obvious man to do it for us.
We also wished to have an Honour Plaque which could be presented to our
Presidents and Chief Savages and others who had rendered distinguished service.
Lyndon Dadswell produced a splendid design in heavy relief in bronze, showing
three aboriginals leaping with vigour and pure joie de vivre on a circular background
of simple aboriginal motifs. Around the edge were the words ?Sydney Savage
Club? and ?Koora-na-boon.? In the original model submitted by Lyndon for our
consideration it was quite obvious that the central figure was a virile male. A few
of the Council demurred and so Lyndon was asked to add an abo bikini. So used
to the uninhibited outlook of the studio, he raised his eyebrows eloquently at the
request, but in a few deft strokes the Savage was almost good enough for Bondi
Beach.
The new Club badge was adapted from this Honour Plaque and is always
greatly admired by visitors to th-e Club. It is used on our stationery and all our
productions in tones of brown and buff, indicative of the bronze original. A list
of recipients of the Club Honour Plaque is set out at the back of the book.
These were golden days indeed. The war was going well and there was
optimism in the air. In the Club, too, there was a fine spirit and in these active
years of 1944 and 1945 our artistic standard was probably at its highest.


AFTER THE WAR the average Australian was sincerely
grieved at the lot of his British brethren, who having, with such
indomitable courage and spirit, stood up to all the rigours and
sacrifices of warfare and emerged victorious, should be faced
with the lack of a square meal. Surely a Pyrrhic Victory. Those
of us who really thought and felt were sometimes almost sheepish
at sitting down to the large Sunday joint and realising for how
CHAPTER XIV

many and for how long this would have to suffice for those in the British Isles.
Australia as a nation demanded that something should be done about it and the
wonderful stream of millions of Food Parcels that were sent across the world was
a spontaneous gesture and an achievement of which we can always be really proud.
Apart from the Savages individual personal efforts in this sphere we decided
tiiat it would be an excellent thing if the Sydney Savage Club could do something
directly for the London Savages on the food front.
In February, 1946, we wrote to Flarold Williams, but recently returned to
Britain, with a request for the names of Savages to whom we could send a parcel.
I ve just turned up his small blue airdetter reply from 4 Randolph Crescent, London,
dated October 2nd, 1946, into which he had squeezed 93 names, with his own

right at the bottom, with a little note beside it. ?Just got in.? In the letter he said,
?you may have some of these already; anyway this lot are all 'alive-ohV Shades
of the many times he had led us singing ?Cockles and Mussels.?
There ware some famous names on the list; here are a few. Mark Hambourg,
Jascha Heifitz, Benno Moiseiwitsch, E. Phillips Oppenheim, Norman Allin, Arthur
Askey, Malcolm Balcom, Leslie Banks, John Barbirolli, Jack Buchanan, Eugene
Goossens, Stanley Holloway, Boyd Neel, C. R. W. Nevinson, John Tillet, Allen
Longstaff, Lionel Logue, Lupino Lane, Tommy Handley, George Belcher, Reginald
Arkell, James Agate. Our parcels went forward and the list of grateful letters, many
from worldTamous personalities, made us feel very humble?but very happy.
Lollowing the success of the first effort we wrote to George Baker, Secretary
of the London Club, for further names and altogether in 1946 and 1947, between
150 and 200 food parcels were sent to London Savages, the cost of each averaging
a pound. At our Hundredth Corroboree on May 28th, 1947, following an inspiring
address by Lrank Ashton, Editor of the ?Sun? newspaper, who had just returned
from Great Britain, yet another fifty pounds for further parcels was raised in a few
minutes.
About this time the volume of food parcels flowing from Australia to Britain
became so great that bulk handling proposals were perforce being brought forward
by the controlling authorities and only person to person parcels were permitted and
limitations were placed on the number that could be sent over a period. This gave
us the idea of making every parcel a direct link between a Sydney Savage as the
official sender and a London Savage as the recipient A card was therefore inserted
in each parcel with the following words:
This parcel is sent to you, a member of The Savage Club,
London, by Brother Savage of the Sydney
Savage Club with fraternal greetings and the sincere hope
that our British Brethren will not, in the future, have to suffer
so severely on the Lood Lront, as they have for so long.
LETTERS OF THANKS
This was a grand success and many Sydney Savages had letters from their
brethren on the other side which gave as much pleasure to them as did the parcels
over there. I recall that Sydney Savage Jim Armstrong?s parcel by a quip of fate
went to London Savage Anthony Armstrong, who contributes to Punch, and a
strong penTriendship developed that lasted till poor old Jim?s death last year.
Bill Lewis? opposite number was Arthur Askey who thanked Bill personally when
later he came to Australia and to the Club. Jack Musgrove?s went to Howard Carr,
who was an early member of our Club, Jim Brunton Gibb?s to George Baker, Norman
Barrell?s to Benno Moiseiwitsch. mv own to Webster Booth, who with his wife
Anne Zeigler was subsequently in Australia, and so on.
Some of the letters are of such interest that I quote extracts;
Dear Bro. Savage,
I received your very welcome parcel with much pleasure.
Believe me it gave much joy to my household of four people.
These gifts from you marvellous folk are a God'send. No
place on earth is more austere than a London suburb. In
the one borough alone 350,000 people have to be fed. I well

ARTHUR ASKEY IN SYDNEY
London Savage Arthur Askey, at a Club Luncheon in 1950, expressing his
thanks to Sydney Savage Bill Lewis for Food Parcels received.
remember the evening that the Sydney Savage Club gave to
us members of the Sir Ben Fuller Opera Co. at the end of
1934, or very early in 1935, on the stage of the Tivoli Theatre.
Cheerio and renewed thanks.
Savage Club, NORMAN ALLIN.
1 Carlton House Terrace,
London.
Dear Hon. Secretary and all Sydney Savages,
I most gratefully thank you all for a magnificent parcel
of food which has just arrived for me at the Savage Club and
with which I have rushed off to my home down here?like a
parent thrush bringing worms to its young. As the father of
three hard-eating children I cannot fully explain to you the
value at this end of these parcels. I can only remain yours
extremely gratefully
ANTHONY ARMSTRONG.
Margarets,
East Harting. Sussex,
Nr. Petersfield.


My Dear Brother Savage,
At the last Committee Meeting of our Savage Club on
the eve of Victory Day, we passed a unanimous Vote of
Thanks to you generous and kindly souls.
I was among the fortunate ones to whom your fifty Gift
Parcels were addressed, and if you had been present when
I arrived home with my hamper, and had seen my wife?s
pleasure, you could have realised how fully your charming
hamper is appreciated.
Always yours fraternally,
PERCY V. BRADSHAW,
The Press Art School, Chairman, Savage Club, 1945.
Tudor Hall,
Forest Hill, LONDON, S.E.
Dear Savage Secretary,
I can?t tell you the excitement when I got a card from
George Baker, our Hon. Secretary, telling me to look into the
office for your parcel.
I wish I could ask you and your wife (if any) to be
my guests at the Palace Theatre, where my play ?1066 and
all That? is competing very well with what passes here for a
heat wave! !
Yours sincerely,
REGINALD ARKELL.
Dear Sydney Savage Club,
Your very kind present of food sent to my late husband
Hubert Harben has been sent on to me by the Secretary of
the Savage Club. I think it is such a charming thought on
the part of your Club and will you please convey my most
grateful thanks to your members and tell them that everything
has been so much appreciated by my family and myself.
Hubert and I spent the latter part of a very happy year in
Australia when we were with Dion Boucicault?s Company
with a repertory of Barrie Plays, and we always looked back
on that time as one of the most delightful of our lives.
With greetings and remembrances and all thanks.
Yours sincerely,
MARY JERROLD HARBEN.

Queensway, London, W. 2.

STANLEY HOLLOWAY
Stanley sent along a photo of himself and
?Junior? with a letter of thanks for Food Parcels from
the Sydney Savages.
The official thanks of the Club came from Secretary George Baker in a number
of letters, of which I quote the one in respect of the last fifty sent.
"I feel that no set of words which I employ can adequately
express our feelings of gratitude to the Sydney Savages for
their truly kind thought on our behalf, implemented in so
generous and practical a manner.
Some of the parcels of food were handed over to the
members to whom they were addressed ?from whom no
doubt you have had letters of appreciation, and the rest were
sent down to our kitchens and utilised for the benefit of the
members in general. In doing this I am sure we we have
interpreted the spirit of your action correctly; in fact I had
confirmation of this from our own and your own Brother
Savage Harold Williams, who now, to our joy, is with us
again, at any rate for a spell.
What I have written is in terms of brotherhood, which
is the only thing that can save the world.?
We did not. of course, forget our own Savages overseas, and a food parcel per
month went to Stanley Clarkson, John Probyn, John Cameron, Breach Riley and
Harold Williams. We rejoice that food rationing in Great Britain is now a thing
of the past, where may it stay forever.


THE OLDEST SAVAGE
One particular aspect of this food parcel era always comes to my mind. Several
letters of thanks for parcels came from an old gentleman by the name of Edward
Michael. After we had stopped sending them, a letter dated April 14th, 1949,
written in a firm legible hand, came from the dear old boy.
As I am now the Father of the parent Savage Clubs
scattered over the world and next year will complete my 60
years? membership of our Club in London I am going to
impose on you to help me. I am in my 96th year and for some
years have been imprisoned in my flat, which I have not been
able to get out of by reason of only being able to totter about
to the door of the room and can only do so by holding n to
the furniture. I am quite happy and not in any way com'
plaining, as I realise how much better off I am here than being
in a German concentration camp from which the wonderful
Winston Churchill rescued us all. It was a very close shave!
He then went on to ask whether we could arrange with some firm to send him
food parcels regularly, and finished off with this sting in the tail for the protagonists
of the Welfare State?
Of course at my advanced age nothing matters to me in the
future but if these fanatical socialists are returned at the
general election in 1950, the once mighty British Empire will
shrivel up into an nth rate state.
We congratulated him on his proud achievement of being the Father of
Savagery through the world and told him that henceforth he would receive a
monthly food parcel with the compliments and sincere good wishes from members
of the Sydney Savage Club.
When in London shortly afterwards in November, 1949, I journeyed down
to see Edward Michael at his home at 391 Clapham Road. The old chap was as
bright as a button, if a bit tottery on his pins. He was fascinated when I told him
I had flown from Australia to England in four days. We had a long yarn and a cup
of tea, and his simple gratitude at the Sydney Savages? kindness was most touching.
In February, 1950, soon after my return to Australia, I had a note from Mrs.
Clara Norman, the splendid woman who was looking after him, advising that this
fine old Savage had passed away ?most peacefully in his sleep on the 4th February
in his 98th year.?
I always feel gratified that I went to see him and feel that it was a happy
circumstance that the Father of World Savagery in London should be helped in
his last years by his new brothers in the Antipodes.

CHAPTER XV
MUCH MOVEMENT IN THE GUNYAH
HAROLD WILLIAMS was soon to return to England and so
at the Twelfth Annual Meeting held at the Coronet in April,
1P46, Jim Brunton Gibb was elected the seventh President of
the Club.
JIM BRUNTON GIBB
n , To th ,�f e who have read these pages so far it will be
Gibb unorfth U o >Uis f � r p? e K t( M d k at n m any Way Up � n the lnfluence of Jim Brunton
th , n P ? tht Sava S e Club - He had performed the onerous task of Chief Savage over
tnc past five strenuous wartime years, as well as before and since; had written our
songs end verses; arranged our Corroboree Programmes; organised and compered
our public concerts ... J
1 feel 1 Ca P Say without contradiction and without making invidious comparisons
pith an yone else who has occupied this most difficult job m the Club, that James
Brunton Gibb is without peer as Chief Savage. With his training and experience
splendid memory, fund of stories, and impeccable delivery, he has all the equipment
necessary for this exacting task. Always in control of his audience, he keeps the
, a rollm �? Particularly when there is some unexpected hiatus in the programme
due to an artist arriving late from another eiv
gagement or some such emergency. Where
another man would be floored after holding
the fort for a little while, Jim can always swing
in with some appropriate lines or verse or with
some notable story from his own experiences in
World War I or from his work with the nzw
Diggers in World War II at Yaralla Hospital,
while his fund of little offerings like this is
limitless:
The Bee?s a busy little soul
He has no time for birth control;
And so it is in times like these
There are so many sons of B?s,
One of my firmest memories of the war years
is Jim, as Captain Brunton Gibb, in uniform
on the dais at the Coronet Corroborees swinging
his gong stick with vim and determination as
he conducted proceedings with so much sin'
cerity as he gave all that was in him to cheer and
entertain his fellows in these wearing years.
WILFRID THOMAS
Chief Savage, 1946-1947.
We were indeed happy that after so much service to the Club he should occupy our
highest office. 7


Wilfrid Thomas was elected Chief Savage although he could not take over for
a few months as he was off again galivanting to the East, this time to Hong Kong.
In the interim Les Levante, who had just returned from a similar mission enter'
taining the troops, acted as Chief Savage with, as would be expected from such an
experienced trouper, great success.
Savages don?t believe in dull annual meetings and there was some unconscious
fun at this one. As retiring President, Harold Williams occupied the Chair. There s
little he doesn?t know about music and singing but the same can t be said about
the niceties of the rules of debate and company law.
There were one or two items of minor contention and Harold was a little
flumoxed from time to time in the intricacies of ? putting the amendment before the
motion,? and other points so dear to the hearts of our legal brethren and of so little
consequence to the artistic mind. Things got a bit mixed at one stage and when Harold
asked where he ought to put the amendment, and John Frith had told him, Savage
Joe Collins rose and said very solemnly, ?Mr. Chairman, as an Annual Meeting,
this is the best Corroboree I?ve ever attended!?
I forget what really did happen to the amendment and the motion. Perhaps
Harold sang them.
WHAT IS SAVAGERY?
As was to be expected from one with such a wide outlook and informed
mentality as Jim Brunton Gibb, his first Presidential Message in ?Koora'na'boon?
makes memorable reading;
In contemplating the past history and present existence
of the Savage Club, my thoughts fly to Robert Louis Steven'
son?s ?El Dorado,? in which he says, ?To travel hopefully is
better than to arrive, and the true success is to labour.? We
are travelling hopefully along the road of our hopes and
aspirations; our destination is far off, but as long as we con'
tinue to labour with wisdom and courage, the ultimate
success is assured.
What is this game of Savagery? It is a game which has
its natural setting and flourishes in the gunyah, around the
camp fire, in the tavern, the market place, or the field of
sport, or in the arena. It results from conditions which strip
off social veneer, bringing people together on a plane of
elemental humanity. It is the Sydney Carton rather than the
Charles Darnay of civilisation, the Robert Burns rather than
the John Wesley of social intercourse. ?Abandon hope all ye
who enter here,? if ye would seek the supreme moral code,
the conventional atmosphere, the manner and speech of
gentility. Here you must expect to find the primitive, the
things of the soil, a closer communion with matters elemental
and a sure and safe sanctuary from the cant, the humbug and
the hypocrisy of the narrow, the mean, and the selfish.
?Koora'na'boon? Sit down, all about, brother.? What a
lovely phrase. It delights the tongue to speak, it soothes the
ear to hear it, and enriches the heart of the man who truly
practices it.


In greeting Gracie Fields at Yaralla Military
Pital, on behalf of two thousand sick and wounded
servicemen, I quoted a verse which might well be
repeated in this message?
When a bit of sunshine hits you
After passing of a cloud.
When a fit of laughter gets you
And your spine is feeling proud,
Don?t forget to up and fling it,
At some soul that?s feeling blue,
For the moment that you sling it,
It?s a boomerang to you.
As good Savages, let us fling our boomerang of
good-will and friendship, and service, whenever we
can, and wherever we can. They will return to us a
hundredfold, together with the satisfaction that we
are making a contribution to good citizenship in
general and to the Sydney Savage Club in particular.
EREACH RILEY
BREACH RILEY CONCERT
One of the first activities in the new Savage year was to organise a Farewell
Concert for talented young tenor Breach Riley, who was about to go overseas in
the great gamble to achieve world recognition. This was held at the Conservatonum
on Bth May, 1946 and was a very delightful Concert, as a result of which some �2OO
was presented to Breach prior to his departure.
Breach opened the programme with three songs, "Caro mio ben? by Giordani
mio tesero by Mozart, and "La donna e mobile? by Verdi, followed by a further
ator � n ho Lindley EvanS and Frank Hu tchens gave duo piano items;
Harold Williams sang Star of Eve? from "Tannhauser,? "Credo? from ?Otello ?
and the Toreador?s Song from "Carmen.?
The Guardsmen Quartette, John Frith (caricature), Clifford Guest (impress
sions), J. Brunton Gibb (character recitations), the Evrard Trio with Kathleen
Dempsey (piano), Inez Lang (violin) and Murial Lang (?cello), and John Bullard
with Idwal Jenkins as accompanist, completed the artists at this fine concert. Harold
Williams and Stanley Clarkson gave a splendid finale with "The Lord is a Man of
War by Handel. (Tickets were 10/6, 7/6 and 5/'.)
In spite of the setbacks through sickness soon after his arrival in England
Ereach has fully justified the confidence that the Club placed in him. He soon won
a three-year opera scholarship at the Royal College of Music and with the help of
his wife, Penny, he has gone forward and become widely recognised in Great
Britain, winning, in open competition, one of the coveted Queen?s Prizes in 1949
and receiving it from her own hands. He was also privileged to be one of the nine
Australian singers in the choir at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation, while for
the past three years he has been one of the principal tenors in the Sadler?s Wells
Opera Company. In 1951 he paid a visit to Sydney and gave recitals at the Macquarie
Auditorium and the Conservatorium, which demonstrated the great benefit that he
had derived from his years of overseas study and experience. In a letter he said


| HI 3>! S

THE GUARDSMEN
?The Guardsmen Quartette?: Stan Rogers, Baritone (left);
lack Neary, Second Tenor (top); David Beecham, First Tenor
(right); and Fred Ommundson, Bass (bottom).
?I can never repay the Savage Club for its help.? His success, resulting from his
own hard work is, indeed, a rich reward for any help or encouragement that we
were able to give. n
He has now returned to Australia and at a recent Corroboree delighted us all
with the maturity in voice and presence that has been achieved. With Ereach and
his wife came two-year old Timothy seeing Australia for the first time. Perhaps
he may be a chip off the old block and be on the Programme when we celebrate
our next years.
The presence of the Guardsmen on this Concert Programme warrants a few
words. The name had some significance for they were all young policemen who
had, I think, sang on Australia?s Amateur Hour and been so well received that they
subsequently formed this splendid Quartette. Fred Ommundson, Stan Rogers,
David Beecham and Jack Neary were fine types of young men and we were happy
to receive them when they applied for Club Membership in 1945. They gave many
fine appearances on a number of our programmes, and were very popular for radio
and concert work for some years before they, unfortunately, disbanded.


AMERICAN BOHEMIANS
In 1945 Savage Dr. Bob Mackay, who was then Superintendent of Sydney?s
Crown Street Women?s Hospital, visited America. In a luncheon talk on his return
he told us of his visit to two American Clubs with very similar ideals to our own.
These were the Bohemian Club in San Francisco and the Cliff Dwellers in Chicago.
We were particularly interested when he told us that he had been taken to the
latter as the guest of Dr. Adrian Verbrugghen, medico son of Henri Verbrugghen,
who was the first Director of Sydney?s Conservatorium when it was opened in 1915,
and occupied the position till 1921 when he was succeeded by Dr. Arundel Orchard.
As many will remember, Verbrugghen was a striking personality and did a great
deal to vitalise Austraban music. In a subsequent letter Adrian, who is very interested
in painting, recalled that he had, when in Australia, given a couple of lectures in
anatomy at the Julian Ashton Art School. He also spoke of Roi de Mestre and
Ronald Wakelin whom he had known.
I wrote to both these Clubs thanking them for their very cordial reception
of our brother abroad, and expressing the desire to reciprocate to any of their
members coming to Sydney. Mr. Kendrick Vaughan, Secretary of the Bohemians,
in his reply said; ?It is heartwarming to reflect that the two Clubs so widely
separated geographically are yet so closely akin in their ideals and objectives.?
Similar cordiality was received from Henry Regnery, Secretary of the Cliff Dwellers,
and we now regularly exchange publications and Christmas greetings. In one issue
of their Club Magazine, ?The Cliff Dweller,? they reproduced the complete page
from our Ladies? Night Programme bearing Lindley Evan?s message ?Koora-na-boon
to our Lubras,? together with Albert Zeck?s pen and ink sketches of a shy dusky
wench being eved by some eager Savages. The Chicagoans comment was ?this is
the sort of thing that goes on in our ?Down Under? affiliated Club, the Sydney
Savage Club.?
When in New York I visited the Lotus Club which is another American Club
which has a character very much akin to these two in Chicago and San Francisco.
GOODBYE TO THE CORONET
For several years it had been realised that with the steady growth of the Club
we would have to find larger accommodation than the Coronet. The Club had
prospered at the Coronet and we had had a memorable five years at this location.
Savage Ivanoff had done his best over this period to give us service under conditions
made difficult by austerity food regulations, staff difficulties and overcrowding. At
about this time he had disposed of the restaurant to other interests and although
the new management signified their willingness for us to carry on, it was the
breaking of this personal tie which no doubt supplied the final pressure that made
us realise that alternative accommodation must be found.
This was an extremely difficult problem and we would probably not have
succeeded had it not been for the co-operation of Savage Bill Brown who, as
Property Manager at the huge organisation of Anthony Hordern 6? Son Ltd.,
was a man of great experience and one who over the years has been always to the
forefront with his goodwill and practical assistance to the Club. Seeing our plight
he said that he thought he could arrange, at least for a while, for the Club to meet
in the Company?s large Welfare Hall on one of the upper floors.


This was a fine spacious hall with a stage and having independent access by
lift from Swan Lane off George Street at the side of the vast Emporium. In
addition to the hall there was a large annexe where the ?Gunyah? could be revived,
while it was indicated that catering could also be undertaken.
This seemed to be the answer to our problem and on October 28th, 1946, our
first Corroboree was held at the new location, which was the fifth in which we
had met over the twelve years of our existence. I can well remember the first
Corroboree that we had in the Hordern domain: the Catering Manageress spread
herself in no uncertain manner and a most impressive array of tasty foods, which
she apparently felt were appropriate for the Savage palate, were placed before us.
HISTORIC FURNITURE
The last night at the Coronet in September, 1946, was arranged as a Members?
Night, at which Savages only attended and no guests were invited. This idea had
been inaugurated a few years before and we now usually have one Members? Night
a year. On this occasion, Savage Len Freeman, one of the original Savage band
and who looked after us so zealously at so many of the initial meetings, handed
over to the Club the table and chairs occupied by the first Council of the Club
when they met in the lounge of the Exchange Hotel in Pitt Street.
Though they had little to recommend them in the way of fine furniture, being
typical hotel ?off the hook?? productions, Len felt that they had a sentimental
value on the lines of ?Elizabeth Slept Here,? so went to some trouble to secure
them for us and they were very gratefully received. These are being held in store
against the day when they can be displayed or used in our premises.
There was plenty of room at Hordern?s and it was therefore decided to admit
the whole of the Waiting List which comprised twentymine new members, though
with this special admission it was prudently decided still to retain the waiting list
for the time being. During the closure period only artisTmembers had been
admitted, and some idea of the fine type of artist that had come forward is indicated
by the following names: Frank Lisle, baritone; Harry Dearth, radio compere; Keith
King, elocutionist; Rex Payne, baritone; Frank Bradley, actor; Ivan Rixon, conductor
and choir master; Marshall Crosby, radio actor; Eric Langker, artist; Alan Coad,
baritone; Reg. Willoughby, tenor; Hal Lancashire, Jack Levy, Bob Duffield, The
Discords; Don Gunn, commercial artist; Bill Constable, stage designer; Bob Dyer,
radio compere; Maurice Rooklyn, magician; George Broomhead and Bern Roberts,
singing team; Bill Maloney, film actor; Neil Easton, Noel Melvin, Kenneth Stenton,
Stanley Swain, singers.
This year, as the Corroboree coincided with Anzac Day, we held a special
Anzac Corroboree at which the responses on behalf of the Services were made by
our own Savages who had served, Colin Gilder, representing the Navy, Ted Geach,
the Army, and John Meynink the Air Force.

CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND
An activity of importance was the inauguration during the year of the Cultural
Development War Service Memorial Fund which had been founded so that Savages
and others desirous of assisting the cultural development of our youth could contribute
towards a fund which is administered by five trustees, three of whom are members
of the Sydney Savage Club and the other two the Director of the National Art
Gallery of N.S.W., and the Director of the Conservatorium of Music, Sydney. The
object of the fund is to perpetuate the memory of all members of the Armed Forces
of the Empire who served in World Wars 1914T8 and 1939*45, and in particular
those members of the Sydney Savage Club and the wives, sons and daughters of
members who so served.
Details of the Fund were placed before the Taxation authorities who approved
that donations thereto shall be regarded as an allowable deduction for income tax
purposes. Proceeds of the Annual Ladies? Night go to this Fund while a number of
Savages generously make yearly donations.
FAREWELL TO HAROLD WILLIAxMS
One of the highlights of 1946 was the June Corroborce when we farcwelled
Harold Will iams on the eve of his departure for London. Harold had been a
splendid President and his presence amongst us had undoubtedly stimulated the
Club. Although he had moved about a good deal in the pursuit of his profession
and consequently had played little part in the actual running of the Club, his
presence, voice, prestige and personality had provided inspiration to us all. He
never ceased to emphasise the cultural aspect of the Savage Club and under his
influence we were very active in this direction. As tribute to his fine work, Life
Membership was conferred upon him.
Immediately following our own Corroboree to him, a Larewell Concert was held
at the Town Hall on July 4th, 1946 (under the direction of Mr. Euston M. Greene),
and many of us were present at this fine public tribute.
BILL BROWN
FRANK CRANE


Wc were sad when he left us not only because we would not hear his fine
voice again for some time hut his genial personality and presence would be missing
from amongst us. As he was going to the austerity of London at the worst of its
food crisis we each month sent him a food parcel with our best wishes.
Looking through the various speeches and luncheon addresses shows how many
interesting topics of the day were covered. Wilfrid Thomas, when he returned from
the East in August, gave an entertaining talk, which he called, with his usual wit,
"The Report of an Absentee?; Professor Eric Ashby spoke on ?This Business of
Russia?; Colonel J. M. Prentice on ?Two Peace Conferences?; Savage Ken Hall told
us of the development of the Film Industry in Australia, a subject on which, as
one of its pioneers, he was well qualified to speak, and whose film, ?Smithy,? but
recently released, had been such a success. Ray Allsop spoke on ?Electronics and
Atomics,? he too being in a unique position, from his years of association with that
industry, to tell us of the ?Wonders of Television,? which we are still waiting to see.
Chips Rafferty also came along with the title of ?An Innocent Abroad?; no doubt
many who know him best will say ?that?ll be the day.?
Harold Williams on assuming the Presidency had initiated the idea of musical
luncheons and arranged a delightful interlude of songs in which he was assisted
by his accompaniste Miss Joyce Hutchinson. This idea was carried forward and this
year a similar musical luncheon was arranged in which Savages Clarrie Black, Ronald
Dowd, and Noel Melvin entertained us. We were happy to have Ron Dowd, with
his fine voice and cheery presence, back again after strenuous years in the Army.
At the second night at Anthony Hordern?s in November, 1946, we had some
film folk along as Club guests. Harry Watt, Producer of the Australian film ?The
Overlanders,? which was proving so successful; Moore Raymond, Australian author
and representative of Sir Alexander Korda?s London Films Company, who had
just arrived in Australia to supervise the making of a film of his novel ?Smiley,?
and last but by no means least, our own famous veteran of the films, Captain Frank
Hurley.
Wilf was in good form in his new role as Chief Savage, though I think, perhaps,
he was always more at ease with his microphone and invisible audience over the
ether than with a pack of very articulate fellow Savages immediately in front of his
rostrum. I remember he would keep forgetting to clout the gong for order. I
suppose if he?d done such a thing in the sacrosanct silence of his padded broadcasting
cell he?d have blown all the fuses in the network.
With the move from the Coronet we had to find an alternative location for our
luncheons as well as Corroborees and we were fortunate in being able to arrange
for these at the Trocadero, over which Savage Jack Musgrove so efficiently presides.
Our first Luncheon in these comfortable and spacious surroundings was in November
1946 when 120 Savages came along to hear Tommy Trinder tell us what ?lucky
people? we were. Our luncheons have been held every month since then at the
Trocadero where, thanks to the kind co-operatioi| of Jack Musgrove, who lends us
a Committee room, the Savage Council also meetsf every Monday at lunchtime, when
over a snack, we conduct the affairs of the Club.
The Ladies? Night came around again in August and once again Frithy drew
the Programme cover for us. It depicted a Savage, top-hat on head, pipe in mouth,


stick through nose, collar, bow Tie and starched dickey- -and a few whisks of grass
around his middle riding a kangaroo in the spacious pouch of which crouches a
lucious laughing nude blonde. A koala points the way to the Corroboree Lubras?
Night. (See page 56.) The Programme included Stanley Clarkson, John Probyn,
Ronald Dowd, Alan Goad, Tipano (accordionist), Syd Clarke, The Discords,
Harry Dearth and Frank Bradley in a sketch ?The Watchmaker,? with Idwal
Jenkins and Richard Thew as accompanists.
Chief Savage Wilfrid Thomas at the bottom of the programme said ?Thank
you for coming to our place. ? Later, referring to Wilf?s suave welcome to the
Ladies, in Kooya'na'boon, Ted Geach said it was done so well as to make permission
to sneak out on the fourth Friday for the next twelve months, a ?pushover.? It was
nice also to have Ethel Brunton Gibb wittily respond to the Toast of the Ladies, as
she had at the early Lubras? Nights at the Arts Club.
HONOUR PLAQUES PRESENTED
A feature of the 1946 Christmas Corroboree was the presentation of the Club
Honour Plaque recently designed for us by Savage Lyndon Dadswell to the following
Savages: George Wilson and E. R. Badgery-Parker, Past Presidents; Joe Collins,
Past Chief Savage; Adrian Ashton, Honorary Secretary, and Trevor Daniel,
Honorary Treasurer. Bill Lewis, a Foundation Savage, made the presentations.
Harold Williams had received his Past President Plaque at his farewell Corroboree,
while those of the two other Past Presidents, H. L. S. Havyatt and Dr. William
Wood, who could not be present, were despatched to them.
Honour Plaques are presented to all Past Presidents and Past Chief Savages and
to other members of the Club who have rendered distinguished service.
It turned out that our stay at Anthony Hordern?s was to be short. Savages
are proverbially lackadaisical and casual regarding their Reply Slips. Either they
don t bother to send them in and turn up in large numbers or, what is worse,
indicate that they are coming and don?t put in an appearance. I suppose if they
were full of all such virtues as punctuality and reliability they would not be good
Savages, so we scold, grumble and forgive ?em, but it does have its problems. " For
the 1946 Christmas Corroboree at Hordern?s some 300 replies were received but
unfortunately a number must have fallen amongst bad companions or lost their
way, for quite a few fell by the wayside and numbers were well down, which
naturally caused catering problems. Another difficulty was that the hall, as the
Welfare Centre for the staff of a very large organisation, was under heavy pressure
for internal functions that naturally had to have preference, and a regular booking
was well nigh impossible, so it looked as if we were on the trail again.
After much walkabout and much yabba, we finally came to rest at the Grace
Auditorium. As always, there were pros and cons. Situated just off Broadway,
for some it was out of the way; to others the parking facilities were a boon. There
certainly was plenty of room in the welbappointed Auditorium but the major
disappointment was that we couldn?t obtain a Friday night, except for our Ladies?
Night and Christmas Corroboree which we had been having there for several years.
Alternative accommodation in these post-war years, when population was increasing
rapidly yet there was virtually no new city building going on, was impossible to
secure and so we agreed to accept the fourth Wednesday for our Corroboree nights,

starting in April 1947. We remained there for five years and had many happy and
successful nights.
The Thirteenth Annual Meeting was held in April, 1947. After a distinguished
year as President, Jim Brunton Gibb could gain no respite, for Wilfrid Thomas
was off to England again to new 8.8.C. success, so Jim returned to his old love of
Chief Savage, to give us further service and enjoyment.
LINDLEY EVANS
Our new President was Lindley Evans, one
of the best known and best liked musical
figures in Australia, who was to occupy the
office for the longest period to date. Born in
South Africa, he came to Australia at an
early age and is a good Aussie except when
the South African footballers are here and he
becomes very ?springboky."
Lin is a most tolerant and kindly man and
the friendliest soul imaginable. His duo-piano
partnership with Frank Hutchens over thirty
years has been unique and it is no exaggera-
tion to say that Lindley Evans is an outstanding
personality in the musical life of Australia.
Tall, thin, smiling, he is a true Savage; a
sincere artist, a bohemian, a good fellow.
We love Lin and his charming wife, Marie,
too.
I don't think I've ever seen him ruffled. He
is most adaptable. At his piano, dignified and
immaculate in tails he is a sensitive and
sincere artist; in ragged shorts and bare-
footed, working on his 28-ft. ketch "Seadrift"
-?which he built himself and singer Joan
Hammond launched?one would never think
LINDLEY EVANS
President since 1947
he'd have an ear for anything higher in the musical scale than an old salt's squeeze-
box. Lin has little of the classical rhetorical equipment of the orator, talks rapidly
as his thoughts outstrip his words and gesticulates awkwardly to make his points,
yet we've had some of the finest and sincerest addresses in our Club life from his
bps. Not only is he most gifted in his profession but he is learned in so many aspects
of music and has the great gift of imparting his enthusiasm to others that he has
become most sought after as both pianist and lecturer. He toured the world as
accompanist to Dame Nellie Melba?for whom he has the warmest regard and
affection. He is a composer of distinction.
Lindley Evans has continued to occupy the
position of President of the Club and his friendly
smile and boyish frankness have become part of
the Savage scene. Each year he urges that there
should be a change but Savages just as regularly
overrule his protests.


100 th CORROBOREE
An early event in the year 1947 was the achievement of our 100 th Corroboree
in May. This naturally called for some recognition and so a special Corroboree
was conducted for which Jack Lee and his Art Committee produced a splendid
Souvenir Programme to mark the occasion.
The leaping Savages with stamping legs and flying arms from our Dadswell
bronze plaque was the decorative motif adopted, ghosted in light brown on grey
paper against which the large ?100 th? in darker tone stood out. Inside, covering
all but the centre section of the triple folder that bore the Programme, were
columns of the names of the Sydney Savages, all slightly ?staggered? at various
angles (this had no significance in respect to the individuals named) to form an
affective pattern.
The Programme was as follows: Savage Ivan Rixon and his Club Choir; Savage
Ronald Jackson, baritone; Gladstone Bell, ?cellist; Savage Reg. Willoughby, tenor;
Savage Gunter Hirschberg, baritone; Savage Stanley Clarkson, basso; Savage Jim
Russell, lightning sketches; the Savage ?Discords,? humorous songs and Savage Bob
Dyer in ?Can You Take It?? Savage Idwal Jenkins was accompanist.
Our Chief guest was Charles Wilmot who had inaugurated in Australia, The
British Council organisation which was instrumental in bringing out such fine artists
as the Ballet Rambert, Boyd Neel Orchestra and The Old Vic. Company. In response
to my letter of invitation, in which I incorporated a few words about the Club, he
said, 1 I do indeed know the objects of the Club and have spent many a joyful if
somewhat riotous evening with your brother Savages in their wigwam in Bristol at
home. ? He was a most vital personality and a splendid speaker and we could not
have had a finer representative of the ?Old Country? to be with us on this
important milestone in our history.
Charles Wilmot subsequently spoke to us at a luncheon and the proposer of the
vote of thanks, wishing to pay tribute to his delightful voice and delivery, referred
to his charming Oxford accent. Some amusement resulted when Charles, in
acknowledging the compliment, mentioned that ?as a matter of fact, Pm a
Cambridge man.?
STANLEY CLARKSON
July, 1947, saw the departure from amongst us of yet another of our leading
artists; this time it was Stanley Clarkson, who had finally decided to storm the
citadel for world recognition with his fine bass voice. A Farewell Concert was
arranged on July 25th at the Conservatorium and the Club took a block of a
hundred seats. Stan was in great form; he must have been, for S.M.H. critic L.B.
wrote:
Sydney singer, Stanley Clarkson, who is shortly to leave
for England, was given a rousing and reluctant farewell at
the Conservatorium last night by an appreciative audience
which heard him in some distinguished oratorio and operatic
singing.

STANLEY CLARKSON
as Sarastro in the Sadler?s Wells Opera
Company production of Mozart?s ?The Magic
Flute.?
JOHN CAMERON
who is at present in Aus'
tralia on a professional
tour for the Australian
Broadcasting Commission.
Mr. Clarkson is a singer whose real rarity springs from
the fact that his strong, direct, and superbly steady bass voice J
is thoroughly musical throughout its full compass. A much'
admired stalwart of Sydney oratorio for the last dozen years,
Mr. Clarkson should assert the quality of his voice in the
highest company overseas.
At first, as with so many, no matter how high their attainment, Stanley found
that the storming called for courage and endurance but he prevailed and tO'day he
has carved a niche for himself in the musical life of Britain.
At the end of 1949, the night before I left London for America, I dined with
Stan, Gladys and his family and afterwards we went to Sadler?s Wells Theatre
to see Stan in Mozart?s ??Don Giovanni,? in which he played the Commendatore.
In this part he is dressed in heavy cumbersome gear to represent a statue and
after the show he was still wet through with perspiration from its confining
embrace, as we dashed across the road to repair the parched tissues at the convenient
local. I thought his voice was better than ever, while the experience with the
Wells had added maturity and confidence.
That Stanley has succeeded in achieving the citadel and is now a leading-
figure in British oratorio as well as opera, is obvious from this extract taken straight
from a letter I received from him dated January Ist, 1955'. (It must have been his
New Year resolution)


1 have had a good season so far, having some very good
concerts in the Festival Hall with the Bach Society and
Goldsmith?s Choral Society. Have two more concerts with
Bach Choir in St. John Passion and the B minor Mass. Also
Messiah with Royal Choral Society in the Albert Hall on
January 15th. 8.8.C. broadcasts and an opera for them in
May (two performances) besides my work at Sadler?s Wells
is keeping me busy. We have had a revival of Faust in which
I am doing all performances of ?Meph.? We have also had
a new production of The Consul (Menoth) in which I have
had a very good press from Eric Blom in the Sunday Ob'
server, and other good notices. On Jan. 26th we have a revival
of Don Carlos, and on Feb. 24th, the first night of a new
production of The Magic Flute in which I shall play
??Sarastro, ?
SUCCESSFUL SAVAGE SINGERS
Other Savage singers were also getting very itchy feet. Ambitious young John
Probyn had gone about the same time at Breach Riley. Stanley Clarkson was on
his way, shortly to be followed, early in 1948, by Reg. Willoughby (who has but
recently returned) and a year later by John Cameron. In each case the Club assisted
by cither taking seats at the Farewell Concerts or making donations to the Testimonial
funds inaugurated by welbwishers to assist them on their way.
John Probyn studied in London first with George Baker, Savage Club Secretary,
and later with Joseph Hislop and in 1949 his hard work was rewarded by winning
the Queen?s Prize of the Royal College of Music, said to be the most competitive
award in Britain. It was a remarkable coincidence and a fine tribute to Australia
that both of the two Queen?s Prizes awarded that year went to young lads who
saw the light of day 12,000 miles away; Breach Riley, tenor, and John Probyn,
baritone. No doubt the <�loo sterling came in very handy to these hard'working
and ambitious young Savages. John, in the same year, appeared at Sadler?s Wells
and so was on his successful way.
Whenever we knew in time we sent a cable on the occasion of the debut of
any of our members and it naturally gave them a kick at such an important moment
in their careers to know that the Savages back home were thinking of them and
wishing them well.
When John Cameron reached London he was in luck for he was engaged by
the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, a few weeks after arrival and remained
as principal baritone for three years. He subsequently appeared with the Glynde-
bourne Opera and in 1952 sang before the Queen at the Royal Concert at Royal
Festival Hall. He is at present in Australia on a professional tour for the A.B.C.
Another outstanding young singer in the Club was Ronald Jackson, who had
from the start been impressive both as to voice, presence and personality, so that
when in 1950 he won the Vacuum Oil Vocal Quest of �lOOO we were not
surprised. With this moral and financial backing, Ronald went to London and
the next news in December, 1952, was even more exciting ?that Ron had won the
Richard Tauber Scholarship which took him to Vienna to study. A few months
later in response to our congratulations I received a note from Ronald and his wife.
Gwenda, which so clearly indicated the thrill of being alive in such an atmosphere
that I must quote from it.


HAPPY SAVAGES
(Left to right) Savages John McKay, Jack Lee, Ted Geach and John Frith.
Vienna, March 19th, 1953.
Gwenda and I are both here in Vienna enjoying every minute of the day. For the
first month or so we have been madly studying Deutsch four days a week, and can
now manage to understand most every-day conversation.
So far we have seen just about every opera in the Staats Operufetoire and some
we have seen three or four times. The singers are of an exceptional standard and
fortunately we hear all from Italy and Germany because there is no objection to them
singing the roles in their mother tongue. When one knows the operas well it is the
music and voice that count, not what it?s all about. The singers here are very rarely
heard in England because they object to having to learn roles in English. Consequently,
London is deprived of hearing the best Continental singers, who spend most of their
time in New York, Italy, Vienna and Germany. Another great feature, too, is that one
can see the best singers for a standing place costing three schillings Austrian (about
1/6 Australian), also one can see an artist one night in a big role and the same artist
in a small role the next night making the standard so high in every degree.
Our future here is verv bright, and we are moving in the right direction with slow,
gradual determined steps with many people helping in every way.
All our Savage singers who have gone abroad have done well and have
maintained the tradition of Australia as a land that produces fine voices as well as
fine wool. Apropos of this, it was of great interest to Sydney Savages to read in
February of this year, when the Sadler?s Wells Opera Company revived Mozart?s
?The Magic Flute,? that Australians occupied many of the leading roles. June
Bronhill, who sang the difficult role of Astrofiammente, Queen of the Night, received
a special award in the Savage Club Scholarship in 1949, when 21 and before she
changed her name from June Gough to Bronhill, after her home town of Broken
Hill. Young Australian lyric soprano, Patricia Howard sang Pamina, the heroine;
Stanley Clarkson, was Sarastro; and Breach Riley was Monostatos. So many
Australians now occupy top niches both at Sadler?s Wells and Covent Garden that
a current joke circulating in London is: ?Opera? No nomAustralian need apply!?


DURING THE WAR YEARS our time was fully occupied
keeping the Club going, doing our utmost for our serving
members and at our Corroborees providing welcome solace and
entertainment for them and other servicemen who were visiting
our shores. In 1944, however, as the war situation improved, we
thought it was time for the Club to take some definite step
CHAPTER XVI
SAVAGE SCHOLARSHIP
in contributing more specifically to the cultural life of the
community. A Committee comprising Harold Williams, Frank Clewlow and myself,
were requested to prepare recommendations for the inauguration of a
bavage Club Scholarship.
Our report, placed before the members in September, 1944, recommended that
the Scholarship be devoted to the assistance of talented young Australians in the
various arts of Music, Painting, Drawing, Architecture, Sculpture, Literature and
such other art as the Committee may approve. Applicants were to be naturabborn
British subjects between the years of 18 and 25. It was suggested that the annual
award should be �5O and to finance it the subscription to members be raised five
shillings per annum. The plan was wholeheartedly approved and the Scholarship
was announced forthwith, advertised in the Press, and musical and educational
institutions circularised.
A number of applications were received and the adjudication carried out, the
first recipient being a dainty little eighteemyear'old blonde pianiste, Miss Marie Van
Hove, who delighted everybody with her modest charm and musical skill when
s e played before the Club. Next year, still only nineteen, having regard to her
development and promise, the adjudicators decided to again give the Scholarship
to Mane, two consecutive awards being provided for in the rules.
Marie Van Hove had worked hard to achieve her success and sincerely
appreciated the opportunity that had been given to her, so much so that ever
since she has continued to be associated with the Club and at any of our Ladies'
Nights, Scholarship evenings, or other functions, always offers her services as
pianiste or accompaniste. She has also been accompaniste to the Savage Club Choir
in their many hours of training and rehearsal, and altogether has qualified for the
unofficial title of ?Sister Savage? by which she is affectionately known by many of us.
In 1945 a special award was also made to Wendy Brunton Gibb, talented
oaughter of Savage Jim Brunton Gibb, in the field of dramatic art which was not
surprising having regard to the prominence of both her father and mother in this
sphere. Wendy?s mother, who uses her maiden name of Ethel Lang, is one of our
best known radio actresses. After starring in the Australian film ?Sons of Matthew,?
Wendy went to England for further study and subsequently toured Australia and
New Zealand, before playing a leading part in the greatest show on earth-
marriage and motherhood. With her husband, Michael Benge, she was recently in
Sydney from New Zealand where she now lives, to show infant Christopher to
his doting grandparents. She plans to again take up her dramatic work after this
happy interlude.


Each year the Scholarship brings forward a number of earnest and talented
young Australians, both boys and girls (although a Men s Club, we have not
confined our award to maks) all so young and so clever, be it singing, piano, violin
or painting, and although we realise the prize is fairly modest, we believe that it
encourages them and helps them on their way, to have the assistance and imprimatur
of the Sydney Savages,
APPLICATIONS INCREASE
As time went on and entrants became more numerous, the adjudicators found
it rather difficult to compare the relative qualities of say a singer and an architect,
or a creative writer and a pianist, so in 195 3, after very careful consideration of
the problem, the Scholarship Committee, comprising Lmdley Evans, Harold Williams,
Ivan Rixon, Jim Brunton Gibb, and myself, recommended that the Scholarship be
divided into two sections.
A. ( Singing and dramatic art.
I Painting, sculpture and architecture.
B. ( Instrumental.
] Creative writing and music composition.
The two sections A and B were to alternate yearly and each category was to
carry a first prize of fifty guineas and a second prize of twentyffive guineas, which
meant that the original fifty pounds a year, which had been from time to time augmented
by special additional awards, was being raised to a hundred and fifty guineas a year.
It was quite impossible to finance this greatly increased amount from the few
shillings in the annual subscription earmarked for the purpose, so appeals are made
to Savages for contributions to the Cultural Development War Service Memorial
Fund which assists in augmenting the Scholarship Fund.
Adjudications were usually held on Saturday mornings, which was convenient
for both working applicants and busy assessors. The venue was Palings Buildings
m the studios of Jim Brunton Gibb or Richard Thew, who generously gave their
premises and services, which were most valuable, as both have had many years of
experience in this field. Some recent entrants have received their audition at the
Conservatorium studios of Bindley Evans and Harold Williams. When required,
the services of experts in specific fields are called in to advise the Club?s adjudicators.
In the earlier years we arranged for the winners to appear on a Corroboree
or Ladies? Night Programme so that Savages could hear and see the recipient
of their own Scholarship. Later, however, we organised separate Scholarship
Nights, at which winners and, perhaps, those who receive special awards or honorable
mentions, provide the entire programme.
FIRST SCHOLARSHIP CONCERT
The first Scholarship Night was held at the Trocadero on May 4th, 1947.
Th is was a Sunday night and Jack Musgrove kindly allowed us to hold this little
Recital in the comfortable foyer of this vast auditorium on the one night that it was
not in public use. (It was a private function and there was no charge).
The programme comprised the winner for 1946, Miss Isabelle Mallitt (18),
violinist, and Miss Marion Graham Smith (19), pianist, and Mr. Paul Miskell (19),

tenor, who had received special awards. We were very happy about the award to
Isabelle as she was a ward of the Sydney Legacy Club.
After the items and presentations, light refreshments were served in a con-
versazione atmosphere and altogether it was a most enjoyable evening which set
the pattern for those which have been held every year since. In the gathering of some
four hundred we were pleased to see that many Savages and their wives had brought
their sons and daughters to hear these talented young folk. Amongst our guests
were Boyd Neel, who was in Australia with his orchestra, and Wee Georgie Wood,
a London Savage. What Georgie lacks in stature he makes up in verbosity for J
i �call vividly how, restlessly walking back and forth, he berated us quite soundly
for being much too polite to each other in comparison with the London species.
The presence of women at even a Savage Club function of this type also seemed
to disturb him profoundly.
The year after we had made provision for the subdivision of the Scholarship
to meet the increase in both the number and type of applications, for no apparent
reason that we could fathom, there was but one entry in the instrumental section.
After examination, the adjudicators decided to make no award.
A somewhat greater number of applications were received for 1954 but the
adjudicators, after auditions and very careful consideration, decided that, having
regard to the high standard that had always been maintained, an award should
be withheld. &
In view of our Anniversary Year and to stimulate anew interest in our
Scholarship, it has been decided for 1955 to combine all the four categories and offer
generous prizes in each, which will easily be our most ambitious effort to date. We
hope that this Twenty-first Anniversary Scholarship Award will bring forth some
outstanding talent.

I have now been associated with the organising and adjudication of the
Scholarships for ten years and I never fail to be impressed by the high standard
of attainment of these young people whose ages seldom exceed nineteen or twenty.
A glance through the list of those who have received awards will indicate to those
who are conversant with our musical life that a large proportion of the names have
since become welhknown. We feel, therefore, that our judgment has been sound
and that our efforts in this direction are well worth while.

IT HAS ALWAYS been our aim at Ladies' Night to present
a programme in which good music and singing is leavened with
humour and fun. Both ingredients were well up to standard on
August 22nd, 1947, at the Grace Auditorium. John Cameron,

Evans played idylls, Ivan Rixon and his choir delighted, Les
Levante mystified, Norman Tate juggled and talked continuously

SIR JOHN NORTHCOTT
At the 1947 Christmas Cor-
roboree we were honoured for
the first time by the presence
of His Excellency Lieut.-Gen.
John Northcott, who had just
returned from Japan, where he
had been G.O.C. British Com-
monwealth Occupation Forces,
to succeed Lord Wakehurst
as Governor of New South
Wales. The Governor
graciously accepted Honorary
Membership of the Club and
was invested with his badge
by the President, thus
being the second Governor of
the State to so honour us. The
N.S.W. Police Pipe Band was
present and the piping-in of
the Governor and his aides
accompanied by the Club?s
President, Secretary and Treas-
urer was most colourful and
impressive. Police Commis-
sioner W. J. (Bill) Mackay
looked on with pride. We?ve
had the pleasure of the pipers
on several subsequent oc-
casions, though Mr. Mackay
died soon after. Four hundred
and thirty-five Savages and
guests were present.
SIR JOHN NORTHCOTT
HONORARY MEMBER SINCE 1947
Lt.'General Sir John Northcott, one of Australia?s
most distinguished soldiers, was G.O.C. British
Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan prior
to his appointment, in 1947, as Governor of N.S.W.
His presence at every Christmas Corroboree since
1949 has been a source of great pride and pleasure
to us all.


The presence of the Governor, now Sir John Northcott, at every Christmas
Corroboree since 1949 has been a subject of great pride to us. We regard him as a
splendid Savage from every angle, and believe that he really enjoys these nights of
informality when, having been officially greeted as the representative of Her Majesty,
he is then able to shed his cares of office and relax with us. A few years ago, after
a trip to New Guinea, he strode in bearing a large stone ceremonial axe with
carved haft and elaborate woven counterweight, which had been presented to him
by one of the chieftains in the Mount Hagen area. He told us how the Chief, as a
token of esteem to a distinguished white warrior, wished to give him one of his
latest model wives. The Governor, however, apparently after due consideration,
decided to settle for the axe. He gave it to the Club and at Corroborees it reposes
near the President, ready for instant use on any recalcitrant Savage.
GEORGE FORMBY
In November, 1947, we had our largest luncheon gathering ever. Our guest
speaker was not a world figure in science or letters; not a politician or statesman;
not a great Shakespearean actor or world famous conductor; not even a leading
sportsman; it was George Formby, which seems to indicate that the world wants
laughter and fun and plenty of it. Ukeleles and toothy grins rather than cold wars
or H-bombs.
George said his wife, Beryl, was with him and so we trotted along our ladies
too and 333 sat down to luncheon at the Trocadero. George?s accent and antics
caused much amusement and we gave him a full-size boomerang to stick in his
ukele case. We have been sorry to hear of his recent illness.
The Fourteenth Annual Meeting was held in April, 1948. At the start of my
Annual Report for 1947-1948, delivered at this meeting, the following passage occurs.
And as it is self-explanatory, I quote it.
?Actually speaking, as our Honorary Solicitor, Savage
George Christie would no doubt tell you, to refer to this as the
Fourteenth Annual Meeting is really an incorrect statement
in that you will remember the old Savage Club was ?from a
a legal point of view?reverently laid to rest on August 25th,
1947, at the Trocadero, when ?Sydney Savage Club,? the
newly incorporated body??A Company not for profit, limited
by guarantee and not having a share capital??was born. Con-
sequently, I should perhaps be describing the first four months
of the Report as the Last Will and Testament of an old friend
and the balance as the infant doings of a close relative and
descendant of the Deceased. However, with due respect, we
are Savages, not lawyers?a nice point, I think ?and so you
will all know what I mean.?
The above, in a very unorthodox manner, records the fact that a few weeks
prior to this change-over meeting, on June 24th, 1947, we had become legally
responsible and respectable?to wit, registered under the Companies Act, 1936
(Sections 28 and 34); so said Mr. Percy L. Tompkins, Deputy Registrar General.
We were big boys now!


The incorporation of the Club, though referred to facetiously, was obviously
<i most important event in our history. This desirable step had been achieved thanks
to a great deal of work on the part of our Hon. Solicitor, George Christie, who
\\ as subsequently honoured by Life Membership for this and other services over
the years.
SYDNEY?S OPERA HOUSE
Our Luncheons at the Trocadero had been proving very popular and this is not
to be wondered at, having regard to the splendid series which were a representative
cross-section of the artistic life of Sydney.
Eugene Goossens, Director of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music
and Conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, who had recently accepted
Honorary Membership, gave an address full of fire and vigour in which he claimed
that the Sydney Symphony Orchestra was now one of the seven best in the world.
His next objective was the erection of a National Opera House in Sydney. Seven
years have passed and his constant hammering on this desire, so near to his heart,
uis at last brought results, in that the N.S.W. Government has recently announced
its intention to erect an Opera House on Benelong Point, overlooking beautiful
Sydney Harbour, which is the site he had advocated right from the start. This
magnificent location is surely second to none and Sydney now has *-he unique
opportunity to produce a building that will take its place with the great Opera
Houses of the world.
John Metcalf, Principal Librarian, Public Library of New South Wales, spoke
on the U.N.E.S.C.O. Conference at New Mexico from which he had just returned.
Savage Eric Langker, President of the Royal Art Society, spoke on ?Some Aspects
o Culture and the lack of it in Australia. ? Savage Frank Clewlow, Director of
Drama Australian Broadcasting Commission, told us of his recent trip abroad.
Club guests at Corroborees were drawn from many fields. The Lord Mayor of
Sydney Alderman R. J. Bartley, Professor Donald Peart, First Professor of Music
at the University of Sydney, Actor Peter Finch, soon to go to London to achieve
such great success, Professor G. D. Copland, Chancellor of the National University,
Canberra, and several of the crew of the round-the-world yacht ?Kathleen,? then
m Sydney Harbour. At one of our luncheons we were also delighted to eAtertam
those two charming duo-pianists and London Savages, Rawics and Landauer.
Sir Laurence Olivier was in Australia with the Old Vic. Company and we tried
to arrange for him to attend a Corroboree. His commitments, however, were far
too heavy but he sent us this message. ?My greetings and my sincerest? wishes to
my cousins, The Savages, in Sydney.?
We were going from success to success with our Annual Ladies? Nights and
on August 27th, 1948, at the Grace Auditorium, there was a gatherum 0 f 550 which
almost taxed the capacity of even this large hall. The Ladies? Night Souvenir
programme is always a feature and this year Joe Collins and Frithy did the drawings
On the cover Joe had a little dusky lass, charmingly sketched in soft pencil'

LUBRA NIGHT,
1948
Programme sketch
by Joe Collins.
Sverjensky played the piano, John Frith sketched, Frank Stuart with his (to use the
words of Bill Lewis? programme commentary) ?gang of toughs and two lovely
blondes,? waved their swords on high, Will Andrade (Harry Job) did his magical
tricks, and Wally Baynes his Whacko.
CLUB TIE
The year 1948 saw the advent of the Club Tie. The Savage Club in London had
a tie which its members proudly sported, so we thought that the time was ripe
when we too should endeavour to produce one of our own. Savages Joe Collins
and Don Gunn went to work and produced several designs, three of which were
displayed at a Corroboree for perusal and opinion. That selected had the dancing
aboriginals of our badge stylised into an all-over background pattern in reddish-brown


and black, with small free-shaped shields with the letters S.S.C. in lighter tone
silhouetted on a green ground. John O?Donnell went to a great deal of trouble in
arranging for the printing of the material for the production of both ties and scarves,
reasonable stocks for future use being secured at the same time.
All Savages are required to wear both Membership Badge and Club Tie to all
Savage functions. A breach carries a fine which goes towards Club funds.
A President?s collar was also produced, small silver boomerangs, inscribed with
the names of all Past Presidents and their terms of office, being featured on a blue
band at the base of which hangs a gilded replica of the Club Badge. It is recognised
ritual that at the beginning of each Corroboree, the President is invested with his
Collar of Office and formally handed the whale-tooth Gavel by the Chief Savage.
He in turn adorns the neck of the Chief Savage with his badge of office. This is a
long string of small native kauri shells, at the base of which hangs a large pearl shell
which impinges on different spots of the anatomy depending on the stature of the
wearer and usually causes certain amusement. He is also handed the striker of tne
gong with which to keep order.
ELSA STRALIA SCHOLARSHIP
In her youth, Elsie Fischer, later known as
Madam Elsa Stralia, famous Australian Operatic
Soprano, was assisted greatly by two scholarships
which were awarded at the Marshall Hall Con-
servatorium, Melbourne. After her outstanding
career, she lived in retirement in New Zealand
until 1943, when she returned to Melbourne,
where she died two years later
Never forgetting the early help she had received,
she made provision in her will for the establishment
of a Trust to award annually, if possible, the ?Elsa
Stralia Scholarship.? Administration is vested in
four Trustees, the Trustee of the Will (Mr.
H. L. S. Havyatt) and three members of the
Sydney Savage Club, appointed from time to time
by the Council of the Club.
Conditions for the Scholarship were drafted and
applications were first received in 1948. The Trust
Deed confines applications to girls eighteen years
of age, who are naturabborn citizens of Australia
or New Zealand and natural-born British subjects,
who show ?outstanding promise as a singer.
These conditions made applicants few and it was
not until 1953 that the first award was made to
Miss Joy Mammen, lyric soprano, of Melbourne.
The Fifteenth Annual Meeting came along in
April, 1949. Lindley Evans and Jim Brunton Gibb
continued as President and Chief Savage.
CARICATURE
of President Lindley Evans
by John Frith.


This year we lost from active dayAO'day participation in Club life, one of the
most lively stars in our firmament. I refer to Savage Ted Geach who, following
preferment in his profession, was transferred to Canberra as manager of the National
Bank. Ted, tall, thin, bubbling over with energy, capable, likeable and vital, was
a personality wherever he went. Always ready to do a job, whether it be that of
acting Chief Savage to conduct a Corroboree, or running from here to there in
his car to pick up a few dozen beer, we all missed him very much and look forward
to his periodic dashes up from the Antarctic.
We gave Ted a send'off and presented him with what in the Victorian age
would have been described as an ?illuminated address.? In actual fact it was a
few nice things about him and his service to the Club, strung together and nicely
lettered, accompanied by a sketch by John Frith. A small and insignificant Frithy in
fear and trembling is crouched in an attitude of supplication in the outstretched
hand of the toothy banker, who is looking as if he?d like to eat him. You know how
it is. It is Ted?s most precious possession and decorates his Canberra office. (P. 107.)
Our luncheons continued to entertain and instruct. Denis Winston, First
Professor of Town and Country Planning at Sydney University, was informative
and interesting; Roily Rolls, visiting French Variety pianist, showed Lin Evans
how to play the piano in French in one short lesson and Emile Mercier, droll ?Sun?
Cartoonist gave us a discourse with the succulent title of ?Gravy,? in the dispensing

guffaw and chuckle over his garrulous old girls with their turned'down feet and his
clever topical digs at all and sundry.
MEL WARD
The Australian Aboriginal has a wonderful friend in Mel Ward who spoke
to us in July, 1949. Melbourne Ward, F.R.Z.S., F.Z.S., son of Hugh J. Ward, is
a striking character with his massive head and touseled hair. After starting life on
the stage and doing many things, he now conducts the Gallery of Natural History
and Native Art at Medlow Bath in the heart of the Blue Mountains. His subject
was ?The Folklore of the Australian Aboriginal/? It is not usually realised, he said,
what poetic imaginations our aborigines have, but here is an extract from a native
poem translated by that friend of the Dark People, Bill Harney. The verse is brief,
but gives some idea of the imagination they have.
The folk who tortured Meninmee the dog and 10, he spoke,
And they were turned to Pandanus trees
To stand there mute and dream of bygone days,
And watch their shadows in the rippling stream.
And another . . .
He passed the ant beds where the lizards dwell,
And from them heard the tale how they were men,
Who broke the tribal laws and so they stand,
Locked there in sorrow turned to clay.
Many people have said to me at the Gallery, Mel continued, ?What have the
Aborigines done for us?? The reply is that they have built up, over thousands of
years, a poetic appreciation of Australia and its surroundings which they have set
in legends and myths.
All the natural phenomena have been observed and thought about by these
people. They want to know who makes the sky? What is the moon? Why does
a person die? Even the beauty of flowers, and the quaint habits of living creatures,
all must be explained. You will find all the figments of fairy land in their stories.
Some of the legends are designed to teach moral lessons to the children and I
believe in this regard our Aborigines antedate Aesop?s Fables, and even the ancient
codes of India.

Mel also gave us the following aboriginal words and their meaning which we
published in ?Koora-na-boon? as being of general interest.

Corroboree guests included visiting Czech Conductor Raphael Kubelik, son of
the great violinist; Sir Angus Gillan of the British Council; Richard Jubb,? 8.8.C.
representative in Sydney and Charles Rolfe, a London Savage who had come to
us with a note of introduction from George Baker and whom we were happy to have
with us at the Club on several occasions while he was in Australia. A singer who
made a great impression on one of our programmes was European tenor. Ante
Soljanach.
On August 26th, 1949, the date of the Ladies? Night, I was in Rome en route
for London; my wife, Lesly, however, was there with the lads and lasses who saw
that she was appropriately cheered in the absence of her Savage. It was a fortunate
coincidence that this year, as an experiment, the programme was recorded on a
wire-recorder by John Russon and subsequently put onto several discs. A number
of Savages availed themselves of the opportunity of acquiring either the complete
set or individual records, while by this means when I returned, I had the pleasure
of hearing the only Ladies? Night that I had missed over the years.


SAVAGE CHRISTMAS CARD.
Another innovation this year was the intro-
duction of a Savage Christmas card. Joe Collins
did the drawing and Jack Lee the production.
They sold for sixpence each and were excellent
value and very popular, Savages appreciating
the opportunity of sending a distinctive card
to their friends. Proceeds went to the Cultural
Development Fund. Joe designed the card for
several years and when he passed on, Savage
Albert Zeck carried on till last year, when
through rising costs and limited demand, we
decided to suspend production. It is to be hoped
that this will be revived in the future.
A rather Aboriginal touch was added to our
1949 Christmas Corroboree with the following
verse brought forward by Savage Frank Crane,
Sydney Lord Mayor?s Secretary, who is always
on the lookout for interesting folk and facts
for the Club
Here is the aboriginal.
Wiyabunbilla Bon Murrarah Eloinug

IVAN RIXON
Chief Savage, 1950-1952.
which translated gives us the age-old Biblical quotation;
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
Peace. Goodwill towards men.
The Sixteenth Annual Meeting came along in April, 1950. Bindley, by unanimous
wish, carried on as President but Jim Brunton Gibb, after four years in his third
period as Chief Savage, sought respite and Ivan Rixon accepted the position. Ivan
joined the Club in 1946 and soon had organised the splendid Choir that has given
us so much pleasure over the years. He comes from a musical family, his father
and grandfather also being conductors, and started his music at the early age of
seven, studying horn, trumpet and violin, and later singing. He became well-known
as teacher and conductor, producer of several radio sessions, conductor of the Ivan
Rixon Singers and Musical Director of the Sydney Musical Society. We were
naturally delighted that a man of Ivan?s many parts had become our new Chief
Savage.
IVAN RIXON AND THE CHOIR
Ivan is most energetic, is an excellent organiser and has the capacity to get
things done. He must be all these to cope with his wide activities. It was fascinating
to see him with the Choir. Twelve pairs of eyes watched his every action; twelve
lips moved as one, as he urged, admonished, inspired, modified, with expressive


?-?' ' ,?-" ? ? 1 Q%mS&$wWr
j||||| jag!? � i | H , *�. : t . -
movement of hand, lips and baton. The choir was perhaps at its best this year
with so many keen young singers, all of whom have since achieved distinction in
their own right. Tenors included Paul Miskell, Michael KhlenUos, Robert
O'Donnell, Lorenzo Nolan, Archie Hamilton, Ronald Bevan (now Director, Rockdale
Musical Society) and Geoffrey Moore, who is now Professor of Singing at the
Detroit Conservertoire. Baritones and Basses were Harold Whitlock, Horace Hepper,
Geoffrey Chard, Frank Lisle, Neil Easton, John Young, all of whom have been
prominent with the National Opera Company, and John Cameron, who has
achieved such success in London.
For the July Corroboree Ivan arranged a delightful programme for the Choir
in which he featured the work of three composers ?Werner Baer, George English
and Alf Lawrence?all of whom were present. The songs featured were ?For me
this Land by Werner Baer; ?To a Proud Beauty" by George English and ?The
Lovely Lanes of England" by Alf Lawrence. Evenings such as this achieve the
very essence of Savagery.
GOODBYE TO ?FRITHY?
In February, 1950, we received a blow in the departure of John Frith??Frithy"
to everyone who was going to take up a new job with a Melbourne paper. Frithy
was a grand chap in every way and we still miss him sorely. Some people have the
knack of brightening up their fellows; Frithy only had to come into a luncheon or
a Corroboree with that provocative twinkle in his eye and a story on his lips and
one s spirits began to bubble. Yet Ive seen him down. I?d meet him sometimes
during the morn ng on his way in to the Herald and he?d say ?Pm b if I know
what I m going to do for tO'day." But the creation of ?Cocky" Calwell and so
many other political characters was always on the ball.
He was really sad too when we said au revoir to him at a little luncheon
on February 6th, 1950. So were we. Sydney should never have let him go.
A GOOD STORY
Savage John Frith (left; telling one of his sparkling stories to Barton Fairfax (centre)
and Hubert Evans.


One of Frith?s successors at the Herald was Harry Eyre, Jnr., and we asked
him along to the March Luncheon. He was really pleased and in a line to me said:
?Just a note to let you know how I enjoyed and
appreciated yesterday?s function.
?To he so received and encouraged in a new job by a
bunch of chaps who were all complete strangers to me is some-
thing I will not lightly forget. If that is a sample of Savage
Club hospitality, then let there be more Savages.??
ARNHEM LAND
We had some wonderful luncheon speakers in 1950. The first was Charles
Mountford, a thoughtful and learned Australian who spoke to us on Arnhem Land,
whence he had recently returned as the leader of the joint Australian and American
expedition sponsored by the National Geographic Magazine. He gave us a most
interesting talk and wished to amplify it with recordings of a number of aboriginal
songs that he had made but to our chagrin we couldn?t hear them as they were
slow recordings and our radiogram was not equipped for them.
Arthur Askey, that irrepressible little British comedian followed and after
thanking us for food parcels he?d received as a London Savage, proceeded to double
us up with his wit. He doesn?t mind telling a joke against himself either and
described how in a London cinema viewing his first film with some pride, he was
rather disconcerted, on his appearance on the screen, to hear one woman in front
lean over and say to her neighbour ?He?s deformed, ain t he?
Then John Calvert, ?The Falcon?? in the well-known film series, after an
interesting talk, had us gaping at his amazing thought-reading skill. He placed
pennies over his eyes, these being bound by yards of sticking plaster skillfully placed
in position by Savage Dr. Geoff Howe and then walked around telling us exactly
what we had in our hands, even to the numbers on the ?quid? notes. Les Levante
was probably the only one present who knew how it was done.
Harald Bowden, General Manager of J. C. Williamson and a Foundation
Savage, also fascinated us in a talk in which he told us of his fifty years association
with the theatre, during which he has known so many of the great names of the
Australian stage ?Nellie Stewart, Maggie Moore, George Rignold and so many
others that he couldn?t cram it all in the time and has promised to tell us more
some other day.
Jack Musgrove, with his own theatrical background, was so nostalgic at the
reminiscences that he generously donated the luncheon ?takings? to the Cultural
Fund. If we?d only known we?d have packed the house.
Sir James Bissett, that genial, vital and altogether delightful old sea dog who,
as Commodore of the Cunard Fleet, commanded both of the ?Queens? in turn
for two and a half years during the war, told us of his fifty years at sea. He has now
swallowed the anchor and lives ?where do you think?- ?at Manly overlooking the sea.
Ladies? Night continued to grow and in August, 1950, at the Grace Auditorium,
there were 630 present. As usual, we had some fine singing, this time from Savages
John Milton, John Dudley, Raymond Beatty and James Wilson. Max Barry
performed his very clever and unusual ventriloquil act, ?The Genii in the Bottle?;
irrepressible Bob Dyer did his stuff and lugubriously funny Billy Kearns told us of
?the litle bit of bad luck that came his way.? Dainty little June Gough (Bronhill),
who had received a special award in our 1949 Scholarship, was also on the


programme. Our accompanists were Marie Van Hove, and Savages Idwal Jenkins,
Tom Imrie and Andrew Vern Barnett?son of an illustrious father?who had
recently become a Savage.
JOHN ANTILL?S CORROBOREE
An exciting event both for the Club and for Australian music was the world
Iremiere of Corroboree? by Savage John Antill. A large gathering of Savages
and their wives went along to the Empire Theatre on July 4th, 1950 to see the
/xfiTw rV et Company under direction of the Arts Council of Australia
(JN.S.W. Division) with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, present this remarkable
new conception. Decor by erstwhile Savage Bill Constable in its stark simplicity
and primitive form and colour was a fitting setting for this mystic music drawn from
the age-old heart of our continent and its strange people, by the genius of the white
newcomer who understood and so dramatically interpreted its message. It has now
taken its place with the great national music of the world.
Congratulations to our musicians was in the air, for a few months later Alfred
Hill was honoured on his eightieth birthday on December 16th, 1950, by a Concert
at the Conservatonum. Our telegram of congratulations read, ?All best wishes and
congratulations on your 80th birthday and grand life of achievement from the
oydney oavages.
Congratulations were also called for when in February, 1951 John Antill was
appointed A.B.C. Federal Music Editor and Savage Werner Baer took on John?s
former position as A.B.C. Supervisor of Music for N.S.W. Werner a pianist and

WERNER BAER
JOHN ANTILL


THE YEAR 1949 was an exciting one for me, for in August,
following an invitation by The British Council to visit Great
Britain as their guest, I left Australia on an aerial tour around the
world.
At the time I was President of the N.S.W. Chapter of the
Royal Australian Institute of Architects and also Foundation
President of the newly formed National Trust of Australia
CHAPTER XVIII
LONDON VISIT
(N.S.W.). My chief objective was to study the latest developments in architectural
design and modern building techniques and mechanical methods of construction. I
found time, however, to examine the functioning of The National Trust in Britain,
which has been responsible for the preservation of so many buildings of historical
interest and architectural merit and the retention of so much of the beautiful country'
side of that ?green and pleasant land" from the twin ravages of unbridled commer-
cialism and apathetic Although so much younger, Australia is already
seeing fine architecture, historic buildings and natural beauty being destroyed for
lack of informed opinion and organised effort as emanates from such a body.
If we allow this to continue we will never achieve the traditional richness and
national depth of other lands and peoples.
CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE
Naturally, one of my greatest thrills was to enter the portals of the Club of
which I had read and heard so much. Secretary George Baker was a grand and
cordial host. I was immediately and generously made an Honorary Member for
the period of my sojourn.
It was my good fortune to pay my first visit on October Ist, 1949, when the
Club had its grand reopening after being badly blitzed on October 15th, 1940. In
the intervening period it had, of course, been functioning, but in part of the
premises only.
Many of the older Savages were still nostalgic for the old Club in the Adelphi
which they had to leave when this famous Adam Terrace was demolished in 1936,
and sighed for the favourite North West Room. The new home at No. 1 Carlton
House Terrace was certainly much grander, being the town house of Lord Curz,on
and designed by John Nash. The entrance is in the Terrace, opposite a charming
park wherein stands the statue of cord Cunon, and the building extends right
through to the Mall, which the beautiful Lounge overlooks. It was this part of
the Club that had caught the full force of the bomb and had been closed for the
past nine years.
HISTORIC RE-OPENING
At this period the Club had a House Dinner followed by a musical and humorous
programme once a month, a different member being in the Chair on each occasion,
and in view of the great work that has been carried out by the Honorary Secretary,
Brother Savage George Baker, in the reconstruction work, it was appropriate that
he should be Chairman on this historic occasion.


The Dinner was held in the beautifully proportioned and appointed Dining
Room which holds about 100 and overlooks Carlton House Terrace, and after a
delightful meal, the harmony followed on in the same room with the members
sitting around the tables and enjoying their cigars and drinks.
Chairman George Baker, who paid tribute to all those who had played their
part in the reinstatement, including the architect, Harold Greenwood ?a partner
of Sir Edwin Lutyens?recalled that there were 422 members who had joined
since the blits; who had never known the Club as it had been. The story of the
bombing, which had been beautifully written by Reggie Pound, was read by Hugh
Ross Williams. It was very appropriate and very moving. ?The Savages,? he said,
are a great body of liberal-minded men in a sad and sorry world.?
On this occasion there were two Official Guests, Sir Donald Cameron, Lord
Mayor of Dunedin, who was returning to New Zealand after a visit to Edinburgh,
and myself. I found that I was sitting next to Percy Bradshaw, black and white
artist and author, known for so many years all over the world through his famous
Press Art School.
In response to the very cordial welcome extended to me by George Baker, I
said what a thrill it was, having read Percy Bradshaw?s books, to sit at his side;
having enjoyed Basil Radford s typical British humour on the films to see him
across the table and having heard Leslie Henson on recordings to see him in person
wrack Rachmaninoff ; glancing over to Leslie, who is the possessor of rugged
good-natured features, I said, however, thank God there is not television in Australia
yet! This was received with roars of laughter as being the words of a true Savage,
Leslie thoroughly enjoying the fun, though he pretended to look mortified.
HONOUR PLAQUE PRESENTED
Having conveyed fraternal greetings from the Sydney Savages I then, on
their behalf, presented one of our distinctive bronze Honour Plaques designed by
Savage Lyndon Dadswell, to George and his Savages from us all. I explained the
the words Koora-na-boon and gave them a demonstration of its
delivery. When I sat down the time-honoured clapping was somewhat rudely
shattered by London Savages trying out their lungs with ?Koora-na-boon.? It
wasnt a bad effort but lacked gutso. Although I discounted certain kind comment
that I had made the speech of the evening, I felt that I had not let the Sydney
Savages down.
I also was privileged to attend the next monthly gathering on November sth,
and as soon as I entered the Club, and as a good Savage, made my way to the Bar,
saw that our Plaque occupied a place of honour amongst many fine pictures and
other souvenirs right over the head of the door leading to this sacred precinct.
May it so remain as a permanent tribute from the Sydney Savages to our brethren
in the Mother Club.
On this occasion, being Guy Lawkcs? Day, Savage Alan Brock, the present head
of the famous traditional fireworks firm of that name, was in the Chair and the
Programme drawn by Harry Riley depicted him wheeling a ?Guy? which bore a
strange resemblance to Sir Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer, who at the
time was far from popular with his stringent economy measures, being wheeled in
a dilapidated stroller along the Club foyer. It was a grand night and there was much
fun and levity, to which the cartoonist and humourist, Harry Riley, contributed in
many ways, including fireworks going off in his clothing as he did his turn.

behalf of the Sydney Savages. It takes its place amongst fine pictures and drawings and
occupies a strategic position over a doorway leading to the Club bar.
I always received a most cordial welcome from such men as Sir Charles McCann,
the Agent-General for South Australia; Warwick Braithwaite, the conductor,
recently in Australia with the National Opera; Anthony Armstrong, ?Punch?
contributor; Percy Bradshaw, Leslie Henson, Basil Radford, former Australian
singer Stanley Newman and many others, ah of whom wanted to know all about us.
It was a grand experience. I only hope I shall some day, not too far in the future,
have the opportunity of checking up on their progress in rendering ?Koora-na-boon.?

Brother Savages,
We have recently had the privilege and
pleasure of two or three visits from your
distinguished Honorary Secretary, and we
were particularly pleased that he could
accept our invitation to attend the House
Dinner that celebrated the reopening of
our Clubhouse after the completion of the
War Damage repairs. On that occasion he
not only handed to us the beautiful plaque
that the Sydney Savage Club had sent to
us but he crowned the little ceremony in
a speech that was both eloquent and deeply
moving.
We shall ever be grateful to our friend
Adrian and to all our brethren of the
Sydney Savage Club who have so many
times given us tangible proof of their affec'
tion for the Mother Club.
May I take this opportunity on behalf
of the London Savages to wish you and
your dear ones a Happy Christmas and a
prosperous and contented New Year.
GEORGE BAKER,
Honorary Secretary.
I had the pleasure of telling my Savage pals of my travels and experiences at
a Luncheon in February, 1950. While I was away the task of Hon. Secretary was
generously carried on by Savage Cas Marshall, to whom I record my grateful thanks.


THE SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL MEETING took place in
April, 1951, and was conducted at a Luncheon at the Trocadero,
as had become the custom since leaving the Coronet. President
Lindley Evans and Chief Savage Ivan Rixon were both re-elected.
Jack Lee, Bob Mackey and Herbie Hayward sought relief from
Council activity and new blood in Norman Landers, John Russon
and Albert Zeck came forward. Bill Lewis also retired from the
CHAPTER XIX
PASSING PARADE
Chairmanship of the Council over which he had presided with his good-natured
case since 1944, Savage George Christie being installed as his successor.
SPORTS NIGHT
An innovation was the Jubilee Sports Night held in June, 1951, at which we
adopted a new layout, the various sporting events being staged in the centre of the
floor, which enabled all to see well and engendered a feeling of intimacy between
everyone.
The sporting section of the programme included a spirited demonstration of
table tennis by that agile wizard Michael Szabados, a ?strong-man? display by genial
giant Emil Korishenko who twisted -J-in. nails with his hands like paper-fasteners,
and a demonstration of boxing technique by Jimmy Carruthers, with commentary
by Tommy Burns. We were all impressed by Jimmy?s skill and modesty and were
delighted but not surprised when next year, in South Africa, he made boxing history
by his defeat of Vic. Toweel.
Representatives of practically every sporting body were present as well as 300
Savages and their guests, and the whole evening was a splendid tribute to Savage
John O?Donnell, whose idea it was and whose personal contacts and prestige in this
sphere were of such assistance. We decided to make it an annual event.
Ladies? Night, which had been building up in numbers over the years, was a
record, 633 being present, with the result that even the large Grace Auditorium was
really too crowded for comfort. Actually it had been necessary in the last few
days to curtail the issue of tickets. As a result it was decided we would have to seek
larger premises for this annual event and consequently the next Ladies? Night was
planned for the Trocadero.
LET?S MAKE AN OPERA
There had been a good deal of fun at the Ladies? Night when Edward Renton,
visiting English Conductor of ?Let?s Make an Opera,? so enlivened proceedings by
converting various sections of the gathering into owls, herons, turtle-doves and
chaffinches, who proceeded to vociferously vie with each other in rendering a series
of strange noises which they apparently considered were the native calls of these
inoffensive birds. Naturally, much amusement resulted.
A number of us subsequently went along to see this novel conception of
Benjamin Britten, in which Savage James Wilson was playing, and enthusiastically
joined in the various songs, ?The Little Sweep,? ?Sammy?s Bath,? ?The Night Song?
and ?The Coaching Song.? Most of us took our children and there?s no doubt that
it caught their imagination, and they thoroughly enjoyed it. My two still speak of it.


Lindley Evans and Frank Hutchens gave us a musical treat at the October
Corroborce in a series of delightful duo-piano items which was one of the finest
performances in the Club for many a long year. That elusive Savage spirit pervaded
the whole atmosphere that night and transformed just another Corroboree into a
joyous experience that remained with one for a long time.
The American Night in July was also good fun, representatives of various
American and Australian-American Associations being our guests. The Barber?s
Shop Quartette, in which leading American and Canadian businessman Bill Miskoe
and Bill Robson participated, was ?just fine,??
We had some splendid Luncheons too, that in May being particularly memorable,
for the 1950 Club Scholarships were presented, and we were entertained by Breach
Riley, who was visiting his home town for a few months, and June Bronhill. Wendy
Brunton Gibb, fresh from London, was also with us with Miss Ngaio Marsh and
Robert Stead of the British Commonwealth Theatre Company with whom she was
touring.
EVELYN LA YE AND FRANK LAWTON
A Luncheon that always lives in my memory as being one of the most happy and
charming we have ever had was when our guests were Evelyn Laye and Frank
Lawton, who were appearing at the Theatre Royal in ?Bell, Book and Candle.?
This charming lady told how her father had been a Savage when the London
Club had been at the Adelphi and how, as a little girl, she had been taken into the
sacred precincts, so naturally she was entirely in sympathy and complete under-
standing with Savagery. Frank Lawton, her witty husband, who is a London Savage,
and the original ?Young Woodley,? told us, with much humour, how he?d never
yet lived that role down,
Bill Beatty, the Australian Ripley with his Believe Bill Beatty 1 series of strange
facts, spoke to us on Australian Folk Tales and Traditions. Fine old journalist T. W.
Spencer, but recently retired from the staff of Hansard, and who was reporting
before the Federation of the Commonwealth in 1900, gave us some interesting
reminiscences. He described the famous Anthony Hordern fire on July 10th, 190 L
which he had witnessed and recorded, as vividly as if it had been yesterday. Savage
Bill Brown was visibly moved.
VALE, JOE COLLINS
This year saw the passing of several Savages who had given much to the Club.
First of all that fine Savage and prince of good fellows, Joe Collins, crossed the
Great Divide in August, 1951.
Joe Collins will always occupy one of the very highest niches in Sydney
Savagery. To those who have followed the History to this point, it is entirely
unnecessary to say more, for not only has it been recorded how he created its
artistic character with his consumate skill as an artist, but as Chief Savage in the
early days his effervescent personality was a most vital factor in the building up of
the infant Club.
I oor health had beset his closing years and there had been a sadness in him
that seemed strange and anomalous to those of us who had known him over the years
as the cheery, sprightly Joe. That is how we shall ever remember him.
The second loss was the death of Idwal Jenkins, accomplished pianist and
sensitive accompanist who also had battled gamely with sickness for some years.
Our heartfelt sympathy went to his widow, Ida Elisabeth Jenkins, so well known
to us all over the air.

SAVAGE MUSICIANS
(Left to right): Savages John Antill, Idwal Jenkins and Alex Sverjensky, in cheerful
discussion. Programme Director Bill Lewis looks on benignly.
Then there was grand old Claude Fleming who looked at life with that indolent
tolerance born of a lifetime of experience and of liking humanity. He was loved
by us all. Finally Jimmy Meynink slipped away so suddenly and entirely unexpectedly
that we found it hard to realise. Corroborees still don?t seem the same without them.
Thus another Savage year passed away and we came in April, 1952, to the
Eighteenth Annual Meeting. Findley Evans continued as our President and Ivan
Rixon as Chief Savage.
This Corroboree was our first gathering since the death of the King on February
6th, 1952, and we stood in sad silence in his memory, and then, for the first time,
drank with emotion, the health of our beautiful young Queen Elizabeth IF
Sports Night, modelled on the success of last year, was equally enjoyable.
Savage John Goodge of the ?Sun? and his sporting writers greatly assisting us in its
organisation. There was a boxing exhibition by George Barnes and Johnny Price
arranged by Ern McQuillan; some cycling training by Fionel Cox and John Tresidder,
both Australian Olympic representatives, though this time there was no accident
as had occurred years ago when we had a similar display at the Pickwick. Visiting


American trick golfer Paul Hahn came along with a colossal bag of clubs, but on
account of the indoor setmp he could only talk. He did this effortlessly and at high
power.
AT THE TROCADERO
Ladies Night for the first time was held at the Trocadero, on Friday, October
17th, 1952, and we were very happy with the change, and accommodation ceased
to be any problem. The Adventures of Bloody Danks,? which had been such a
riotous success at the Ladies? Night in 1949, was revived by Neil Hutchison,
Director of Drama and Features, A.8.C., with leading radio personalities Lyndall
Barbour, Reginald Goldsworthy and Athol Fleming, doing the ranting and tear'
jerking. It was just as great a success as previously.
Lindley Evans and Frank Hutchens with a duo'piano item; Neil Easton with the
Club Choir and Orchestra, Geoffrey Chard, the Discords, and comedian Billy Kearns,
provided a well balanced programme. It was nice to hear Bill Wood in action again
with his gaelic charm, proposing the toast of the moon'eyed lubras.
NATIONAL OPERA NIGHT
Another splendid night was the National Opera Appreciation Night in June,
this being inspired by a desire to pay tribute to ail those who had, in their various
capacities, been responsible for the great success of the 1952 National Opera Season
towards which our own Chief Savage Ivan Rixon had contributed so materially as
Associate Conductor and Choir Master.
Those who were present included Eric Langker, President, Joseph Post, Musical
Director, Carl Randell, Producer, Adrian Holland, Coach, together with singers
Geoffrey Chard, John Young, Eric Starling, Alan Light, Frank Lisle, Raymond
Beatty, Russell Cooper, Noel Jelfs, Michael Khlentzos, Douglas Mitchell, Alan Goad,
Norman Dowd, Alan Ferris and Ronald Neil.
Geoffrey Chard was in wonderful voice and his ?Largo A 1 Factotum? and ?Up
from Somerset? were a real joy; likewise Alan Goad with ?Shortenin? Bread,? to say
nothing of John Young with the ?Foggy Foggy Dew.?
It was amusing during the evening to see distinguished conductor Joseph Post
on the stage meticulously following the instructions of ?Maestro? Jack Gunn in
ringing a little cow bell with others to laboriously produce a tune.
It was nice too to have Harold Williams back again from London and to see
him leaning back against the piano as he sang with that effortless grace for which
he is world renowned, such beautiful little songs as ?Eleanor? and ?You Little
Rascal.?
FIJIAN FOOTBALLERS
, Yet mother fine night, attended by over 200 Savages and guests, was in July
wnen we had the first Fijian Rugby Union Team to visit Australia as our guests,
together with Prince Ratu George Cakobau and their manager, Les Martin and
trainer, Pat Raddock. Everyone was impressed with the fine physique and bearing
of these splendid fellows and all present will long remember the three Fijian
including the plaintive which, unaccompanied, with their serious dusky
faces and fine eyes, they sang in their rich deep voices. Lin Evans, in paying tribute
to these sportsmen, said ?to them football is still a game, and therein lies an example


jT
m * *
\W V
lo we lesser white folk." After presenting Lin with their emblem?a palm tree in
silver inlay on polished tortoishell?they gave, before departing to bed for the next
day?s game, their war cry, and it looks as if the All Blacks will have to look to their
laurels.
We took the opportunity of paying tribute to our Olympic athletes on their
leturn from Helsinki, and had with us Harry Alderson, President of the Olympic
Federation and Mr. D. K. Donald, Manager of the Athletic Team, as well as those
fine young Australians, John Treloar and Mervyn Wood.
Poor old Frank Stuart should have been with us but he had died suddenly as
he was about to journey to the Games at the head of the fencing team which he had
trained. Frank, triumphing over the grave injuries received in a car accident years
before had, on many occasions, given us all great pleasure in the many displays in
the art of fencing for which his enthusiasm never waned.
The Lord Mayor of Sydney, The Rt. Hon. E. C. O?Dea, also came along,
resplendent in his magnificent Indian headdress as ?Chief of the Southern Blue
Waters? and told us of his trips to Canada, Great Britain and Holland.
In the Luncheon sphere, Jack Cato, F.R.P.S., a whimsical member of the
Melbourne Savage Club and its official Chronicler, reminisced on his many years
as a Savage. A true Savage, he said, should always be rude to fellow Savages but
meticulously courteous to guests; he was never so happy as when named that
?contemptible cad Cato? by his Melbourne friends. He should get along splendidly
with Neville Cardus and Wee Georgie Wood who had expressed similar sentiments.
With the Korean conflict raging, there was a certain emphasis on international
affairs and Frank Ashton, Editor of the ?Sun? who had, as a member of a party of
editors, recently returned from the battlefront, spoke on ?Korea and the threat to
Australia.? It was not a talk that would appeal to those seeking the mental balm
of escapism and he left us in no doubt that the modern Chinese is a first-class
soldier who can hold his own with anyone. The message he drove home was that
if we wish to survive and retain this country, we must snap out of our ridiculous
complacency.
JOHN COODGE
MONTE LUKE


Selkirk Panton, internationally known authority on foreign affairs who has
had the adventurous career associated with such a calling, also spoke on the ?Cold
War. Those who read his column in the Sydney Press know that he is no ?yes?
man. Savage Jim Macdougall, ?Sun? columnist, also told us of ?Contact Abroad ?
during which he had travelled 56,000 miles by air in sixty days covering the Klondike,
Jamaica, Vienna and much in between. His impressions and anecdotes, humorous and
serious, were most entertaining.
In order to augment the funds of the Cultural Development Fund, Jack Mus-
grove generously made available one of the Trocadero Sunday Night Dances (that
are permitted by the authorities providing the proceeds are allocated to appropriate
causes), to the Club, as a result of which the Fund benefited by Savages taking
tickets and public attendance to the extent of some �l6O.
The Nineteenth Annual Meeting was held in April, 1933. Lindley Evans was
re ?'elected President for a further term, although he had indicated that he thought it
was high time for a change. He was unanimously overruled. Ivan Rixon, however,
sought relief from the strenuous task of Chief Savage and once again the old
Maestro, James Brunton Gibb, agreed to take over.
The year 1952, to use the words of our President in his remarks at this meeting,
had been a tricky year; it was also, of course, a tricky year for Australia. The wool
bonanza was over and sincere efforts were made to stem the tide of inflation and
to foster a realization that continued national prosperity, to have a solid basis,
oepends on hard work, and that even such a favoured country as Australia could
not continue forever upon the primrose path of more money for less work.
Obviously these factors had their repurcussions in the life of the Club. Our
costs continued to rise, attendances slackened somewhat and as a result the spaciousness
of the Grace Auditorium in respect to the size of our gatherings was further
emphasised, so efforts were intensified to find smaller premises wherein we could
once again recapture that spirit of intimacy and cameraderie which, strange to say,
seems to be integrally associated with rubbing shoulders fairly closely with our
brethren.
SMALLER MEETING HOUSE
Aftei a good deal of frustrating search in a city where the population was
expanding rapidly but in which major building was virtually static, we were fortunate
in arranging for Corroborees to be held in the Hall of the 1.0.0. F. Building, 100
Clarence Street, Sydney, though unfortunately we were still not able to secure a
Friday night.
In April, 1953, we had our first Corroboree at this new meeting house, and it
was immediately apparent that the Savages liked the snugger and more friendly
atmosphere of this pleasant interior where everyone seems nearer to each other and
the artists are in closer contact with their audience. Supper at the tables was
also a link with the past, and though we did not achieve the luxury of potatoes
in their jackets, as of yore, the curry a la Crane in the winter months was a nice
Savage dish. Savage Bob Elvy continued to send up a fine piano for each Corroboree
as he had kindly been doing for so long.
We limited Savages to one guest each the first night but as all was well and
there was ample room, this precaution was at once eliminated. With the friendly
co-operation of Bill Newton and Geoff Game?plurry good oddfellows?we arc
much at home in our new gunyah and we hope our next walkabout is far away.


THE MAY CORROBOREE was the nearest to the Coronation
on June 2nd, 1953, and on this memorable night President
Bindley Evans, standing beneath a fine coloured photograph of
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth 11, delivered an inspiring address
and pledged the Club?s loyalty to Her Majesty in the following
terms:
CHAPTER XX
WE COME OF AGE
?We, the members of the Sydney Savage Club, hereby
solemnly pledge our loyalty to the Throne and our fealty to our Sovereign, Queen
Elizabeth 11. We pray that she may be long spared to reign over us. We pray too
that Almighty God will pour down His blessings upon her, that she may be given
strength to carry out her vow of dedicating her life to her people?a Vow of
Dedication to be consecrated on Coronation Day. God Save the Queen!?
A Pledge of Loyalty on behalf of the Club was also sent forward to Her
Majesty and in due course the following reply was received from Buckingham
Palace:
Dear Sir,
I am commanded to convey to you and to all those on
whose behalf you wrote, the expression of the Queen?s thanks
for your kind and loyal message on the occasion of Her
Majesty?s Coronation. Yours very truly, Edward Ford.
WELCOME TO GOVERNOR-GENERAL
A message of welcome was also presented to His Excellency, Field Marshal
Sir William Slim, GovernomGeneral of Australia:
We, the President, Council and members of Sydney
Savage Club, loyal, devoted and dutiful subjects of Her Most
Gracious Majesty, Queen Elizabeth 11, extend to Your Ex'
cellency the most cordial and sincere welcome. We trust that
as representative of Her Majesty the Queen, your term of
office will be as satisfactory to Your Excellency as we know it
will be of benefit to the people of Australia. May we ask that
our greeting be conveyed to Lady Slim, and also express the
hope that Her Excellency will be completely restored to good
health.
Bindley Evans, President.
Adrian Ashton, Honorary Secretary.
SPORTING TRIBUTE
Our pattern of Corroborees followed on the usual lines. In September at the
Sports Night we had an impressive gathering of over forty leading sportsmen and
representatives of sporting organisations including such eminent figures as Darby
Munro, Jack Crawford, Maurice McCarten, Jon Henricks and Adolph Basser.
A feature of the evening was the presence of Jimmy Carruthers, Bantamweight
Champion of the World, who gave an impressive demonstration with his trainer,
Bill McConnell, which left little doubt as to what was in store for ?Pappy? Gault
in the forthcoming challenge. Two years previously Jimmy and Bill had been
along to our Jubilee Sports Night and gave a similar display. Since then he had


become an international figure by being the first Australian to hold a World
Boxing Title. When he won his championship in South Africa the Club sent him
a cable of congratulations. This time we were able to do it in person.
Another striking item on the programme was the display given by lan
Westbrook, the Australian stock-whip cracker, who had recently returned from
London where, as a member of the Bertram Mills Circus, he had appeared in a
Royal Command performance. Jockey Darby Munro was heard to remark, sotto
voce, as lan swung his great fifty foot long stockwhip, that he wished he had one
like it for Randwick. The evening was completed by a bright speech by Mr. Justice
Dovey, A.J.C. Chairman.
TRIBUTE TO ALFRED HILL
The November, 1953, Corroboree was undoubtedly the most significant in the
whole series, for it was on this occasion that we had the privilege of paying tribute
to Savage Alfred Hill, the Grand Old Man of Australian Music, and a Foundation
Member of our Club who, to use the President?s words, ?holds such a position of
honour and respect throughout the whole community.?
During the evening we heard a recording of one of Alfred?s works, ?Green
Water, played by the A.B.C. Orchestra conducted by Sir Eugene Goossens, and with
the poem by John Wheeler spoken against the musical background. With character'
istic generosity Alfred insisted that another recording entitled ?The Ghost of Henry
Lawson, the music of which was by John Antill, also should be played. Norman
Barnes sang several of Alfred?s aboriginal songs, two of which, ?Poor fella me? and
the ?Kulamin? were particularly charming. The evening, of course, would not have
been complete without the famous ?Wiaiata Poi.?
It was gratifying indeed during 1953 to see such widespread recognition of
Alfred?s work in the presentation of his ?Australia Symphony? by the A.B.C.
Orchestra, ?A Moorish Maid,? by the Kogarah Operatic Society, and the revival
of his earlier opera, ?Tapu.? None who were present will ever forget this grand
upstanding 82-year-old musician with his mane of hair and characteristic moustache,
telling us with pride that he still had enough teeth to get along with, didn?t need
glasses and that ?the girls still had to look out.? What a Savage!
In July we had a Radio Night, our guests including Mr. H. E. (Bert) Beaver,
of Station 2KY and President of the Commercial Radio Stations Association, Mr.
Clive Ogilvie, General Manager of the Macquarie Network, Frank Fox of 2CH, and
Mr. Bert Button of 2GB. It was interesting to hear our President mention during
tne evening that he and Frank Hutchens on their two pianos were in the first
broadcast from Australia to England.
The previous year the Club had made available a sum of sixteen guineas to
the City of Sydney Eisteddfod for a Sydney Savage Club Vocal Duet and a Vocal
Trio, and we had the winners of the former, Trevor Jones and Robert Bickerstaff,
on our Christmas Corroboree Programme. The Club has continued to make this
award available as just another small gesture of encouragement to our rising young-
singers.
ERNEST BURBRIDGE
We had some splendid Luncheons, too. In June, Ernest Burbridge, 0.8. E.,
representative in Australia of The British Council, spoke on ?Shakespeare and
Stratford. Prior to coming to Australia he had lived for many years in Stratford-
upon-Avon and is a Life Governor of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and, in a

FUN IN THE GUNYAH
Five happy Savages are (left to right) Jack Musgrove, Gas Marshall, Bill Moloney, Albert Zeck
and Frank Crane. All are fine raconteurs. Quiz! Who told the story that is causing the mirth?
splendid address full of knowledge and humour, he made one understand Shake'
speare?s mind and left no doubt that he and no one else wrote the plays. This was
a luncheon for both Savages and ladies, and the guests included Mr. and Mrs.
Burbridge, Patrick Donnell, manager, and Robert Stead, assistant manager of the
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company then in Sydney, also Miss Doris Fitton,
Director of the Independent Theatre, and Mr. Eric Wahlquist of J. C. Williamson.
When in England I had the pleasure of visiting Mr. and Mrs. Burbridge in
their delightful 16th century (circa 1520) thatched cottage, ?Brookside,? at Shottery,
Stratford'upon'Avon, and so was given the privilege of thanking them on behalf
of the Club.
In November we had a luncheon address by Michael Sawtell, a member of the
Aborigines? Welfare Board, on ?Australia?s Destiny.? Like a prophet of old with
his white hair and dramatic figure, he spoke inspiringly of the outback country that
he knows and loves so well. Australia, he said, required two things? Water and
Culture ?and he quoted Henry Lawson to prove it.
The Dream of the Poet of the Southern Cross
Will never be realised
Until the country is irrigated
And the people humanised.
His quotations were numerous and very apt, and one that particularly struck me
was ?Ideals are like stars ?you cannot grasp them but you can steer a course by
them.? He revels in Australia?s bush'balladists and poets and as a finale quoted the
memorable lines from ?Clancy of the Overflow? by Banjo Patterson.
... he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended
And at night the wondrous glory of the everlasting stars.

BROTHER SAVAGES
The greeting, 'B r �tfi er Savage,? gains added significance in this
happy shot of Savage brothers Arthur Herriott (left) and
Malcolm Herriott.
W. A. "Bert Oldfield, Australia?s veteran cricketer, told us how England had
regained the Ashes in the recent Tests after twenty years, this appropriately
taking place in Coronation Year. It is our custom when thanking our luncheon
speakers to hand them as a memento of their visit, a rather handsome ashtray, which
bears a replica of our Club badge rising from its centre. Jim Brunton Gibb and Bert
were Diggers together in the 19144918 days, so he was making the presentation
and in doing so he handed it to him most carefully, facetiously remarking that if he
tossed it over Bert one of the greatest of wicket'keepers?would probably have
dropped the b thing.
We acknowledged the existence of the atom era by inviting Professor Harry
recently arrived Professor of Physics at Sydney University, to speak to
us on "The Role of Atomic Energy in Australia?s Future.?
Bearded Professor Messel is a rugged personality and looks like an old
Elizabethan in the new Elizabethan age. He is a dynamic speaker and drives home
his arguments with force and logic. Australia is lacking in coal, oil and water, he
said, but is generously endowed with uranium, one ton of which is equal to 3,000,000
tons of coal. This great potential must be developed by free enterprise, and he is
taking steps to atract top ranking physicists to Sydney to assist him in the research
necessary and to train the men who will be required in the future. His crusading
fiorts have been crowned with considerable success, culminating in the splendid
gifts of �50,000 each from Mr. Adolph Basser to construct an electronic computer
and from Mr. G.B.S. Faulkiner for a nuclear research laboratory.
Author and traveller Colin Simpson spoke of his book on New Guinea, ?Adam
with Arrows,? a companion to his most successful ?Adam in Ochre,? dealing with
the aborigines in Arnhem land in North Australia. His third, ?Adam in Plumes,?
has since been published.


On the musical side Charles Moses, General Manager of the Australian Broad'
casting Commission, told us of his visit to 87'year'old Sibelius, the famous Finnish
composer, and of the reverence and respect in which this great man is held by his
compatriots. Flautist Victor McMahon also spoke on the interesting family of
recorders, the ancient wooden instruments that preceded the modern flute, and
demonstrated their delightful tone in several items. He explained that its comparative
simplicity to play enabled many people, with little musical skill and experience, to
achieve the joy of ?making music? ?instead of only being tacit listeners. Ivan Rixon
in expressing our thanks, said that music was the only universal language that
carried its message to all people.
Victor had been on a recent Corroboree programme and Jim Brunton Gibb,
who is an old friend, gave us the following offering with apologies to our Savage
flautist. I know no-one who does Dennis as well as James.
THE DISAGREEABLE MUSICIAN

But, spite of all we done, the selfish brute,
?E wouldn?t play the flute.
At the termination of my Annual Report for 195 3'54, presented in April, 1954,
I made reference to the thrilling presence of the Queen in Australia.
THE QUEEN IN AUSTRALIA
?Nineteen fifty Three will go down in the annals of the British Commonwealth
as a year of inspiration, for its highlight was the Coronation of our gracious Queen
Elizabeth 11, whom we have all seen grow up through happy childhood to charming
womanhood. Her recent presence among us, with her gallant husband, the Duke of
Edinburgh, has been an experience that none of us will ever forget, and perhaps I
can express it no better than by saying how unreservedly proud it makes one to be
a member of the great British Commonwealth, and to have such a figure, who
personifies all that is good, at its head for our inspiration. God Save the Queen!?
During these thrilling days while the Queen was with us it was announced
amongst the various Honours Lists that Savage O. D. A. (Ollie) Oberg had been
awarded the C.M.G., and Savages Roy Nilsson and Alfred Hill the 0.8. E., all
having the great privilege of receiving these honours from the hand of the Queen
on February sth at Government House, Sydney. All Savages were delighted to
learn of the award of the Knight Commander of the Victorian Order to Savage
Sir John Northcott by the Queen on her departure from Sydney, likewise that
Savage Superintendent George Smith and Savage Len Robb were made Members
of the Royal Victorian Order for their services to Her Majesty while in New South
Wales.

?THE DISCORDS?
Our good friends ?The Dis-
cords,? Savages Hal Lancashire
and John Levy, set forth this year
to try their luck in London, and
the Club made them a small finan-
cial gift to assist them on their
way. It was a big adventure,
having regard to the fact that
humour has a particularly national
characteristic and London is the
world?s hardest proving ground.
We were pleased, therefore, in
due course, to receive a letter
from Hal Lancashire, telling us
that after the usual preliminary
period of assimilation, they had
been engaged for three months
to appear at Oddenino?s ?La
Romania? Restaurant at Picca-
dilly Circus, where they had a
nightly show at 11.30, an hour
that, perhaps, seems strange to

characteristic pose.
Australians but is indicative of the difference between night life in London and
bydney. That they were entirely successful was obvious from a further six months?
contract. They had been along to The Savage? and had appeared on the programme
at one of their House Nights.
In the same letter, it was interesting to read of the enthusiasm of these two for
the wealth of concerts and recitals that they were enjoying, particularly the 1954
Promenade Concerts at the Albert Hall, where they had heard Barbirolli, Beecham,
Basil Cameron, John Hollmgworth and Sargent, this being the Diamond Jubilee
Season of the famous Henry Wood ?Prom? Concerts. Hal was also full of enthusiasm
or a new Italian Soprano, Graziella Sciutti, who apparently has everything and to
use his words was a ?riot? at Glyndebourne as Rosma in ?The Barber of Seville.?
The Twentieth Annual Meeting was held in March 1954 at the 1.0.0. F. Hall,
100 Clarence Street, Sydney, and was followed by a Corroboree. This was an
innovation for we had for some years been having the annual meeting at a luncheon
It was quite successful and virtually meant that we had an additional Corroboree
in the year, so we decided to follow this plan in the future.
Lmdley Evans and Jim Brunton Gibb were again invited to continue in their
respective offices of President and Chief Savage. When we're on a good thing we
like to stick to it. s
The Ladies? Night came around again on October 27th at the Trocadero and
features of the programme were the mixed choir of twenty arranged by Hubert
Lvans, James Wilson and Mary Adams in duets and Russell Cooper singing ?God
Bless This Land? which, written by Savage Bradley Ryne, had its first performance
on this occasion.


PRESENTATION TO GOVERNOR
At the Christmas Corroboree we were
honoured for the seventh occasion by the
presence of the Governor, Lieutenant-General
Sir John Northcott, and a happy event of the
evening was the presentation to Sir John of a
Savage Honour Plaque. ?This is quite un-
necessary,? said he, with his usual modesty, in
thanking the Savages for their kindness. We
did not think so, for we wanted to show in this
tangible manner the great regard that we have
for Sir John as Governor, man, and Savage.
On the programme, Royston with his two
dolls, boy and girl, who cracked back and forth
at each other, was in fine ventriloquial form.
Sprightly little Warren Kermonde had us in fits
with his clever miming act in which it was very
hard to believe that his funny vacuum cleaner
act and his rollicking rendition of ?Figaro? was
not coming from him but from a radiogram off
stage with which he synchronised his lips and
actions in a truly remarkable manner.
At a Corroboree devoted to the Arts we had
as our guests, Douglas Dundas, President of the
Society of Artists; Aubrey Thomas, Secretary
of the Associated Music Clubs; Denis Winston,
SIR EUGENE GOOSSENS
Honorary Member since 1948.
Professor of Town and Country Planning, University of Sydney, and Hal
Missingham, Director of the National Art Gallery of N.S.W.; the latter, being
rather prone to the unconventional, sang his response to the welcome extended, at
the same time producing strange and remarkable noises. The presence of some forty
members of the Sydney Male Choir under the conductorship of Lyndon Jones and
arranged by its Chairman, Joe Weatherley, a former Savage, made this a memorable
night.
SIR EUGENE GOOSSENS
An outstanding Luncheon address was given in July 1954 by Savage Eugene
Goossens. He is a difficult man to pin down to a date as he spends so much of his
time flying around the world or dashing about Australia, and even to give this talk
he rushed along between rehearsals for Faust.
He told us that while in London recently he had conducted in the Royal Festival
Hall and praised it highly. ?I wish I had had the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
there with me,? he said, ?it would have held its own.?
We were delighted when Sir Eugene was knighted in the recent Birthday
Honours and felt that the words of the ?Sydney Morning Herald? Leader expressed
the thoughts of all: ?Few services to the community are more fitted for such
distinction than his. No man has done more to deserve it.? It is sincerely to be hoped
that, following the recent warning that nature has given, he will spare himself a
little more in the years ahead.
This was followed by two further Luncheon talks of particular interest by two
leading figures in the current National Opera season. Warwick Braithwaite, the
Musical Director, spoke on ?Opera in England? in which he told us that Covent


SCIENTIFIC RELAXATION
Original research and discovery?one of our membership categories?was well
represented at a Corroboree when distinguished scientist, Professor J. P. Baxter
(right) was a Club guest. With him is President Bindley Evans and (standing)
Herbie Hayward, who was Acting Chief Savage?hence the shell necklace.
Garden, Saddler?s Wells and the Carl Rosa Company all now receive a Government
Subsidy. ?As a result,? he said, ?Opera has now come to stay in England. To be
successful it must also be subsidised in Australia, and we must, of course, have an
Opera House.?
"A National Theatre; Do We Need One?? was the provocative title selected
by Robin Lovejoy, the Principal Producer, for his thoughtful address on the
importance of a virile theatre in a nation?s culture. The Theatre, he said, is the
most easily assimilated of all the Arts.
THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT
A highlight of the Sydney Musical Year was the Thirtieth Anniversary
Concert of Frank Hutchens and Findley Evans, held at the Sydney Town Hall on
April 22nd, 1954.
This was a remarkable tribute to a remarkable achievement by two remarkable
musicians, who have over this period of thirty years done so much towards
furthering the interests of music in this country. It marked to the day the thirtieth
anniversary of the first recital that they gave on their two pianos in the Com
servatorium Hall on April 22nd, 1924. ?For sentimental reasons? they played some
items which were on this first programme.
The Club fortunately arranged in advance to secure a hundred seats but it
was impossible to obtain any more as the whole of the Town Hall was booked out in
twenty-four hours, and was packed to the doors. At the termination of a splendid
programme, in which Harold Williams was the associate artist, a presentation was
made to the two pianists by Fady Harrison, and at the request of the Organising
Committee, it was also my pleasure on behalf of the Club, to present both these


- v //////Ppm?/7/
Savages with a laurel wreath bearing an inscribed boomerang, a simple but sincere
gesture which they greatly appreciated.
I made it clear in my remarks that the choice of the wreath did not signify
that we thought they had ?had? it. Amidst laughter, I explained that, on the
contrary, they were bestowed on them in the Roman manner, as conquering heroes.
At their wish, the whole of the proceeds from the concert, amounting to some
�I2OO, are being directed to establish a ?Students? Aid Fund;? surely a wonderful
gesture, by two splendid Savages of whom we are all very fond and very proud.
Since then, as the result of further concerts that they have given as far afield as
Broken Hill, the fund has risen to some �IBOO and I believe the goal selected is
the establishment of a hostel for the accommodation of young people who come to
Sydney to study music and who so often have such great difficulty in finding
somewhere to live.

partnership was celebrated in a splendid concert at Sydney Town Hall on April 22nd, 1954.
They are photographed on the roof of the Sydney Conservatorium with the Botanical Gardens
and Farm Cove behind them.
All who have had pleasure from hearing these two pianists will heartily endorse
Neville Cardus? words in the ?Sydney Morning Herald' 1 some years ago.
?Frank Hutchens and Lindley Evans obtained unity and style on two keyboards
much more easefully than most pianists obtain it on one keyboard, and they played
without fuss and exhibitionism . . . For once in a way the critic could praise without
convenient references to local standards.
?I have never heard a two'piano performance more musical than this one or
more intimate in the exchange of felicities. Both pianists played with obvious
enjoyment.?
The ?New Zealand Herald? speaks truly, too, when it says: ?One was amazed
at the complete fusion of two personalities which could produce playing matched
so perfectly that the illusion of music from a single instrument was never lost.?


Our Twenty'first Annual Meeting was held on March 22nd, 1955, at the
1.0.0. F. Hall, and it was appropriate that our original ?Savage Missionary," George
Cowie, should be with us to open this historic meeting with his Benedicite. Bindley
Evans and Jim Brunton Gibb ?those Savage stalwarts ?were re-elected to their
offices of President and Chief Savage for this important year.
The Savages made it a memorable one for me too, by conferring Life Member-
ship and paying tribute, in the most generous terms, to my nineteen years as
Honorary Secretary of the Club. In expressing my appreciation I said that never had
I been to a Corroboree ?and I had missed very few over the years ?that I had not
gone home feeling better and happier for the company and good fellowship of my
brother Savages.
In the affairs of men and their works, the attainment of the Twenty-first year
is generally regarded as one of special significance. Thus there were naturally many
references to this fact and also to the Anniversary Birthday Corroboree which,
to be held on Friday, August 26th, 1955, will coincide as near as is possible,
to the date of the First Corroboree held twenty-one years before on Friday,
August 24th, 1934.
Although the actual completion of our full twenty-one years operation does not
strictly occur until June sth, 1955 (the Club being formed on June sth, 1934),
having regard to our desire to have this History completed for handing to our
members on the occasion of this Birthday Corroboree, it was decided to terminate
our recapitulation of events at the Twenty-first Annual Meeting.
THE PAST: THE FUTURE
To some, the Sydney Savage Club, without its own Club premises, is somewhat
of an anomaly. To an extent there is substance in this thought, for naturally a
permanent home enables that day to day contact with our Savage brothers, that
impact of minds and personalities over meals, drinks, and chat that is so valuable
and stimulating. To date we have not been fortunate to arrive at this stage of
development; nevertheless in referring to this fact it is in no measure an apologia,
for in our own fashion we have greatly benefited by our Savage association, and
we are also satisfied that we have been able to make our meed of contribution to
the artistic and cultural development of our city of Sydney.
There is a peculiar link between Savages the world over. It represents, to
quote words that I remember from the reopening dinner in 1949 at the Savage Club
in London, ?a great body of liberal-minded men;? and what is needed more in the
world of to-day? While perhaps the Savage may be intolerant towards the Philistine,
who, in our Opening Ode, is peremptorily told to depart, he is towards each other
and to his fellow men in general, the soul of tolerance and understanding. To be
a Savage is not necessarily a measure of artistic attainment or worldly success; it is,
on the contrary, a measure of humanity. There are some who do not understand
this and to such it is futile to try to explain. The past Twenty-one years in our
Club have been happy ones. I can recall the absolute minimum of friction or
misunderstandings, which would indicate that these intrinsic qualities of the true
Savage are firmly implanted in our hearts.
On such an occasion one looks backward and forward. This history, of
necessity, devotes itself to the latter, yet at the same time it permits prognostication
of the future. Sydney and Australia are developing rapidly and it is obvious that


the influence of Savagery in all its implications has a real part to play in the years
ahead.
Many of us over the past twenty-one years have put a great deal of effort and
personal time into the conduct and welfare of our Club, but I know I am speaking
for one and all when I say that for everything that has been given, rich dividends
in friendship and spiritual and mental satisfaction have been achieved.
The Toast of Good Fellowship given by Chief Savage Jim Brunton Gibb
seems to me a most appropriate note on which to terminate our first twenty-one
years of Savagery in Sydney.
TOAST OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
Here?s to all good pals
In this world and the next,
I give to them a toast ?-
Good fellowship, my text.
Not to the man who takes your hand
In an idle hour or so,
Nor to the fellow who slaps your back
As long as the drinks do flow.
But to the fellow who takes your hand
When things are going wrong,
And says to you, ?Cheer up, old pal,
Life?s only just a song.?
Now what if you know that fellow lies,
And what if he knows it too;
For there?s many a time that the man who lies,
Is the only one that?s true.
Cavil and cant you prudes who will,
At the evils of whisky and gin;
For there?s many a time that the truth flows out.
As long as the drink flows in.
For a man?s a man, and a cad's a cad,
Whatever God made him to be;
But a man who?s a man won?t forget he?s a man
When he?s out on a bit of a spree.
So fill up your glasses to-night, friends,
And heart to heart let it run?
?Here?s to all good pals all over the earth,
God bless 'em?every one!?
To the Savages of the future. I would sav. Come, sit down, all about. Brothers.
KOORA-NA-BOON!
