INTEODUCTION.
Since the first appearance of this pamphlet,
ten months ago, the case of Mr. Barber has as-
sumed a new form. A second application has
been made to the Court of Queen?s Bench, for
permission to renew his professional practice, and
he has met with a second refusal, accompanied
by an intimation that no further application will
be entertained.
As regards the merits of his case, they stand
precisely where they did previously to his last
application to the Court; and my object, both in
these introductory remarks, and in the notes
which are appended to the text in this new edi-
tion, is to prove that the unfavourable result of
the application, so far from affecting the equity
of his claim to just compensation, entitles him
to more consideration. The demand for this
pamphlet having created a necessity for a third
edition, it is impossible to republish it with-
out reference to his altered position.
The recent application to the Court was made
by Mr. Boebuck. The selection was a happy one,
as regarded the tact and talent of the advocate.
I was not present, but I have heard from every


quarter high encomiums on the forensic skill with
which Mr. Roebuck performed his part: yet in
one respect it was unfortunate that I was not with
him, as I find from the judgment that the only
reference made by the Court to the new evidence
before it was founded on a total misconception
of an averment in Mr. Barber?s affidavit, which I
only could have satisfactorily removed, the aver-
ment having been introduced by myself. Before,
however, I further notice and explain this aver-
ment, it is expedient to advert to the peculiar
manner in which alone the Court would permit
the case to be again presented to them.
The application having been once made and
refused, it was intimated to Mr. Roebuck that he
could only be heard in respect of new matter for
consideration, supplied by the affidavits.
This was imposing a severe restriction in
limine : certainly there was matter both new and
important to be produced; but it was notorious
that the judgment of Mr. Justice Patteson, pro-
nounced on the first application, had been chal-
lenged, on the ground that it was at variance with
the evidence, even in its then imperfect form;
and the importance of the new matter was chiefly
to be found in this, that, by perfecting the evi-
dence, it exposed the errors of the previous judg-
ment, and showed that it was not sustainable by
the facts; it was the cumulative and not the indi-
vidual proof afforded by the new matter, that gave
it value : it infinitely multiplied the difficulties
and incongruities incident to the theory of guilt,


but it did not profess to establish the theory of
innocence, per se. It had been hoped that in such
a peculiar and wholly unprecedented case, and
where the complaint was that the Court on the
former occasion had misunderstood some material
circumstances, and had fallen into error, there
would have existed an inclination on the part of
the Court to receive even a colourable pretext for
re-opening the argument: this hope was disap-
pointed, and hence Mr. Roebuck found himself in
the embarrassing position of attempting, as it were
by a side wind, to shake the previous decision of
the Court, when at the same time he was fully
conscious that it could not be overturned except
on a full and fair review of the grounds on which it
was avowedly based. He was shut out from this
review by the Court, and driven to rely on new
evidence, which, however conclusive when coupled
with the facts and illustrated by the arguments
advanced on the former application, was com-
paratively of little value when standing alone.
This will be proved in detail in the notes now
added to the text in the following pages. Most
assuredly it was by no slight effort of professional
ability that, under such embarrassing circum-
stances, Mr. Roebuck succeeded in producing
even a transient impression on the mind of the
Court.
On Mr. Barber?s former application, the argu-
ments of the opposing counsel appeared to have
had the effect of misleading the Court as to the
true bearing of many important facts ; and in its


judgment, delivered by Mr. Justice Patteson,
many circumstances were assumed to be true that
were not so, or did not fairly wear the complexion
given to them.
One of these erroneous assumptions was this,
that Mr. Barber, in his communications with the
parties really entitled to the stock of which
Eletcher defrauded them, suppressed the truth,
though he might not have suggested falsenood, and
thus ? put them off the scent.?
To make the point of this intelligible to the
reader before he has perused the following narra-
tive, it is necessary to explain, that Mr. Barber,
being professionally employed by Eletcher to ascer-
tain whether a living party, A. 8., was entitled to
certain stock of which the dividends had been un-
claimed for twelve years, and which stock Eletcher
had represented to belong to the representatives of
another A. B. deceased, withheld from the living
A. B. the description of the property, rendering
only such general particulars as might furnish a
clue to a party bond fide entitled. Mr. Barber
vindicated this partial disclosure on the ground of
professional caution; as, if he had disclosed too
much, he might have enabled the living A. B. to
set up a counter claim against the representatives
of the deceased A. B.; and he rested his vindica-
tion on the same principle that guides a man who
advertises a purse he has found, to describe its
contents in general terms, instead of specifying
the numbers, dates, and amounts of the notes it
may contain. It is obvious that without such


caution a false claimant could easily show an
apparently good title to the purse and insist on its
restoration without even paying the cost of the
advertisement.
It was necessary for Mr. Barber to contradict
this imputation of the Court by his affidavit; and,
at my suggestion, to avoid the possibility of being
charged with any attempt at evasion, the affidavit
was framed on the principle of denying what was
charged against him, in every instance, as nearly
as possible, in the very words of the judgment. In
this instance, the charge was general, and could
only be contradicted in general terms.
Eollowing this principle, I, and not Mr. Barber,
introduced the following negation into his affi-
davit :
? The instructions given to him by the said
Joshua Eletcher, neither in this case nor in any
other case, involved or directed any deceit, mis-
statement, or misrepresentation, nor even any
suppression of the truth on the part of this depo-
nent, except so far as might be necessary to pre-
vent parties from setting up unfounded claims or
sustaining claims that were well founded, to the
prejudice of the said Joshua Eletcher?s title to
just and reasonable compensation. Denies that
he ever practised any deceit or any suppression of
the truth, except so far as in the exercise of what
he considered to be a sound professional discretion
was necessary to avoid the suggestion of un-
founded claims tending to litigation, and to secure
such compensation as aforesaid to a client whose


business was valuable to this deponent, and whose
character and objects he had at that time no
reason to distrust.?
Who could have supposed it possible that on
this passage (selected from an affidavit of fifty-
eight brief sheets), Lord Campbell, arresting his
quotation at the words ?no reason to distrust,?
should have placed the following construction?
? This remarkable passage seems to us to afford
a clue to Mr. Barber?s whole conduct, and con-
firms us in the belief that, though he might
neither have contrived the forgeries, nor been
privy to the execution of them, he chose to be
ignorant of all particulars which it would have
been inconvenient for him to know, and that he
wilfully abstained from making such inquiries as
a respectable attorney ought to have made,
because he felt he must have declined the business
and quarrelled with Lletcher, or have become an
active party to the transactions, however criminal
they might turn out to be.?
On my giving the above explanation to one of
our most distinguished Law Lords, in conversa-
tion on the subject, he exclaimed, as well he
might, ? This unfortunate man seems destined to
be the victim of unceasing misconception.? Had
I been in court, I should certainly have considered
it imperative on me to have tendered the same
explanation to their Lordships, had they allowed
me an opportunity.
As Lord Campbell quoted no other part of the
evidence, either on new or old matter, the judg-


ment itself must be considered to rest on pre-
cisely the same foundations as Mr. Justice
Patteson?s. If the following pages have success-
fully impeached the one, they will not be neu-
tralised by the other.
But I cannot afford to waive the advantage
which his Lordship appears to have given me,
and therefore, not losing sight of that deep
respect which we owe to such high judicial
authority, I will endeavour, in becoming terms,
to prove that this second judgment actually
strengthens Mr. Barber?s position, though avow-
edly designed to extinguish his claims for ever.
It is right to give the short-hand writer?s
transcript of it.
Westminster Hall, June 4, 1851.
IN THE QUEEN?S BENCH.
In the matter of W. H. Barber.
Judgment.
Lord Campbell. ?We have deferred giving our opinion upon
the fresh application in this case, made in the last Easter Term,
that we should have an opportunity to peruse the additional
affidavits, and to reconsider the judgment formerly pronounced
by the Court in discharging the rule granted to shew cause why
Mr. Barber?s certificate, as an attorney, should not be renewed.
Having done so very deliberately, and without regard to any
technical difficulties which might have stood in the way of our
giving full effect to any equitable circumstances, we are deeply
concerned to be obliged to declare that we see no sufficient
reason for altering the view before taken of his conduct in these
transactions.
I may mention that, although I had not the honour to be a
member of this Court * when the former judgment was pro-
* This is a curious error. His Lordship was Chief Justice of
the Court when the judgment was pronounced.


nounced, I have several times perused that most elaborate judg-
ment, and that I entirely concur in the conclusion at which my
learned brothers then arrived?that if Mr. Barber was not
directly cognizant of the frauds in the forgery cases, or some of
them, it was because he must have been wilfully blind, and did not
choose to inquire into the character of those transactions. If such
was the state of his mind when acting as Fletcher?s attorney,
and enabling that wicked man in four successive cases to avail
himself of forged wills, ? although he might not he a party to the
forgeries,?surely he is not a fit person to be permitted to practise
as a solicitor. Had he been merely the dupe of Fletcher, God
forbid that he should he debarred from the exercise of his profes-
sion, even if he were chargeable with a high degree of indiscretion
and supineness. But if an attorney, suspecting that his client is
engaged in a systematic course of fraud and forgery, continues to
act for him as if he were assisting to enforce just rights, and to
give effect to genuine documents, he is guilty of gross miscon-
duct, although not originally privy to the frauds, and although
never informed of the manner in which the forged documents
were obtained, and although, to carry on the imposture, persons
may be introduced to him acting a feigned part.
The principle on which the Court formerly proceeded cannot,
therefore, be disputed, and I think the proofs supported the
inference they drew.
In the new affidavits we find no facts brought forward to
alter our opinion. Fletcher?s exculpation of Barber is made
more distinct and prominent; but, from long experience, we
have learned that little weight is to be given to the statements
of such a convict as Fletcher, and he leaves untouched the main
facts, from which we consider that suspicion, amounting to com-
plicity, must have entered Mr. Barbers mind.
Unfortunately for Mr. Barber, we are greatly strengthened
in the belief that a just view of his conduct was before taken
by the Court, from the information he has afforded us in his
new affidavit as to the principles on which he acted. In com-
menting on one of the cases of forgery, he saith, ? That the in-
structions given to him by the said J. Fletcher, neither in this
case nor in any other case, involved or directed any deceit, mis-
statement, or misrepresentation, nor even any suppression of the


truth on the part of this deponent, except so far as might be
necessary to prevent parties from setting up unfounded claims,
or sustaining claims that wex?e well founded, to the prejudice of
the said J. Fletcher?s title to just and reasonable compensation
?denies that he ever practised any deceit or any suppression of
the truth, except so far as, in the exercise of what he considered
to be a sound professional discretion, was necessary to avoid the
suggestion of unfounded claims tending to litigation, and to
secure such compensation as aforesaid to a client whose business
was valuable to this deponent, and whose character and objects
he had at that time no reason to distrust.?
This remarkable passage seems to us to afford a clue to Mr.
Barber?s whole conduct, and confirms us in the belief that,
though he might neither have contrived the forgeries nor been
privy to the execution of them, he chose to he ignorant of all
particulars winch it would have been inconvenient for him to
know, and that he wilfully abstained from making such inquiries
as a respectable attorney ought to have made, because he felt he
must have declined the business' and quarrelled with Fletcher,
or have become an active party to the transactions, however
criminal they might turn out to be.
Adhering to the principle of the former decision, and finding
nothing in the affidavits to induce us to vary from the conclu-
sion of fact which the Court then took, we are bound to refuse
the rule to show cause which was moved for by Mr. Roebuck ;
and we wish it to be understood that this is our final judgment ,
which the misconduct of an individual has drawn down upon
him, and which a due regard for the pure administration of
justice has required us to pronounce.
The rule therefore will be refused.
I acknowledge my inability to perceive how
the ?technical difficulties? of the application
were disregarded, when Mr. Hoebuck was so
strictly confined to new matter that, judging by
the Times report of his speech, no notice whatever
was taken of even one of the many grounds on
which the previous judgment has been questioned.


If I am not misinformed, Mr. Roebuck himself
was made a convert by the perusal of this
pamphlet. Mr. Barber has informed me that all
the statements of facts which it contains being
verified by affidavit, it essentially constituted Mr.
Roebuck?s brief; and therefore, unless he found
himself* shackled by what had fallen from the
Court, I cannot understand why no allusion was
made to any of the numerous points on which
the first judgment is here assailed. I may,
perhaps, be misled by the report, though the
reports of the Times are not often inaccurate;
and it seems probable, also, that the Court would
not have omitted to advert in detail to any rea-
sonable objections against its first decision, had
it permitted any such to be urged, by ? disre-
garding technical difficulties/? However this
may be, it is at all events clear that though Lord
Campbell declared his entire concurrence in the
former judgment, and avowed it in terms that
imply a sort of obligation to vindicate it, or at
least a knowledge that it had been impugned, he
abstained altogether from noticing the arguments
opposed to it; and according to the newspaper
report, Mr. Roebuck was reduced to the necessity
of relying exclusively on the confessions of the
other prisoners.
But, and I say it with unfeigned respect, I.
think that Lord Campbell has strengthened those
arguments very materially ; his silence alone
would have been significant; his judicial lan-
guage is something more. His Lordship has


distinctly put it as an issue of guilt or innocence,
? suspicion amounting to complicity must have
entered Mr. Barber?s mind.? It is for this simple
issue that I have all along contended. Mr.
Barber was an accomplice, or he was not. This
is the true, the only just form of stating the case.
? Suspicion amounting to complicity ? is, in other
words, guilty knowledge: here there can be no
mistake, no misconception, no beating about the
bush to find the question. We now know from
the highest authority with what we have to grap-
ple, and that knowledge admits us into exami-
nation of all the evidence and all the facts from
first to last: it is not suspicion, but guilty know-
ledge that we have to disprove, and, disproving
that , the Court itself admits that Mr. Barber was
only a dupe, but not on that account disqualified
for his profession. It will be found on perusal
of the narrative, that on this issue, at all events,
Mr. Barber has an overwhelming weight of
opinion in his favour : the opinion of the jury
who convicted him, of the Government who par-
doned him, of the officials who guarded and
watched him, of the Bench and the Bar at
Sydney, of the same high authorities at Madras,
of nearly the whole profession in England, and
of the press universally. Yet I will discard all
this; I rely solely on the circumstances of the
case ; on the facts, admitted even by his enemies.
I contend upon these facts, not only that he is
innocent, but that his guilt is morally impossible ;
that the contrary hypothesis involves absurdities


so great, and contradictions so palpable, that
credulity itself would be staggered at a different
conclusion.
If it is thought that this language is too
strong, I reply, that since the first publication, I
have had ample opportunity of learning the effect
of the argument on the minds of men far superior
to myself in all that is essential to form a sound
opinion. On this broad issue, then, of guilty
knowledge, I feel that Mr. Barber is secure; nor
can any judgment of the Court, avowedly based
on new matter alone, and repudiating a second
discussion of the old, affect that issue.
It had been intended, as will be collected from
the narrative, to go to Parliament last session;
but the intention was abandoned, partly through
the illness of a distinguished nobleman, by whom
the petition was to have been presented, and
principally because it was doubted whether Par-
liament would entertain a subject which was
actually before the Courts in another form.
When judgment was given, the session was too
far advanced to allow of an appeal to the House.
In Mr. Barber?s altered position, tbis step seems
to be the only one remaining for him, and I
understand that he will adopt it. I will, there-
fore, address myself to the question of due com-
pensation.
It would be trifling with common sense to
waste time on the obvious position that every
man who has sustained unmerited injury is
entitled to proportionate compensation at the


hands of the party who has occasioned the
damage: this is the foundation of all the law of
society; but there seems to he a recognised
exception to this rule where the injury has been
occasioned by error of judgment in the bond fide
administration of the law, without any taint of
malice: the only objection that can be urged to
Mr. Barber?s claim is, that his case falls within
the exception.
It cannot be denied that those who are only
the ministers of law, must be protected in their
difficult and often invidious duty, so long as
improper motives cannot be imputed; and, to a
very considerable extent, the same protection is
due to those who take the initiative and set the
law in motion. The machinery of our juris-
prudence could not be ? put in working gear ? on
any other principle; and probably it is for this
reason that a prosecution is subjected to so many
preliminary forms, and an accused party invested
with so many protective privileges, that the laxity
of our practice in criminal matters appears, in the
eyes of foreigners, almost intended to facilitate
the impunity of crime. Where redress for unjust
prosecution is, in the absence of malice, so
difficult, it is only reasonable to interpose such
checks on the prosecutor as shall prevent a false
accusation. And these checks, on the whole,
are found to be efficient; cases occasionally
occur where, from the incapacity of our county
justices, men are committed for a time on
charges obviously untrue, and sometimes pal-


pably absurd; but in such cases a grand jury
ignores the bill, or the Court directs an imme-
diate discharge. The cases are very rare in which
a party is not only put on his trial, but convicted,
though innocent of the charge; but such cases
have occurred, though not so frequently as to sug-
gest to the Legislature the necessity of providing
an appropriate remedy: Mr. Barber?s is one of
them. Let it be granted for the moment, for the
sake of argument, that his perfect innocence is
not established. It cannot be denied that it is at
least a matter of doubt; it will be conceded on
all hands, that there is no impossibility in such an
hypothesis ; that it may be true that he was only
a dupe instead of an accomplice. Then it follows
that unless a remedy by petition to Parliament is
open to him, a member of a liberal profession,
realizing an income of ï¿½3,000 per annum, may
be falsely accused and convicted of felony, his
business ruined, his property forfeited, his charac-
ter blighted, his physical and mental faculties
bowed down to the dust by cumulative persecu-
tion, and his degradation perpetuated by personal
rancour and judicial error, and yet our social
system has provided neither remedy nor compen-
sation ! Upon the bare possibility that his case
is truly stated, such must be the extravagant con-
clusion to which we are driven, by applying to it
the principle, that compensation for injury is not
due where injury has been caused by the bond fide
though mistaken administration of the law. It
may possibly be rejoined, that in all phases of


society there must exist some anomalies of this
kind; that the most experienced sagacity, and
the finest intelligence, cannot be supposed capable
of unerring justice ; that the innocent must some-
times suffer for the guilty, and individual wrong
cannot at all times be avoided in legislating, or in
carrying out the law for the general good. This
may he conceded ; but, nevertheless, the Legisla-
ture, wherever it has foreseen a wrong, has at
the same time provided a compensation for that
wrong. All railway Acts afford abundant proof
of this providence in justice. The twenty millions
paid by national consent for the abolition of negro
slavery, is a permanent and glorious monument
of our legislative equity. On what ground, then,
can it he contended that such equity should
not he retrospective as well as prospective ?
that it should not compensate wrongs which it
could not foresee, as well as wrongs that it did
foresee ? Surely not on the selfish apology that
in the one case the public must pay, wTiile in the
other the burthen can he placed on the right
shoulders. And in fact it has acted on this retro-
spective principle. The treaty of Paris of 1815
provided for the claims of British subjects on
Prance. Unexpected difficulties occurred in the
investigation of those claims. Our Legislature
interfered, and enabled the Government to take
on itself the liquidation of them for the very
inadequate consideration of a million sterling,
which Prance agreed to pay. The payment of
the excess, which I believe was considerable, was


so far a recognition by Parliament, of its moral
obligation to compensate for the injuries sustained
by British subjects as an unfortunate result of
public measures that could not be foreseen.
Parliament has even gone farther than this, and
suspended a penal law in its anxiety to prevent
injury to parties who have violated it uncon-
sciously, and therefore innocently. Many years
ago a client, the proprietor and publisher of a
provincial newspaper, came to town in much
anxiety to consult me on a qiii tarn action with
which he was threatened for some error in the
?imprint,? which he could not detect. On com-
paring his imprint with that of the Times and
the Herald lying on my table, I found that they all
corresponded; this led me to examine the Act,
when I detected a breach of its provisions that
subjected the publishers to ruinous penalties : the
parish of the publisher?s residence was omitted in
all. I instantly proceeded to every newspaper
office in London, apprised them of their error,
and the next day every paper had adopted a new
imprint in its present form ; but the change was
not prompt enough, a gang of informers having
already commenced actions for penalties, which,
in the case of the Times alone, would, I believe,
have amounted to fifty thousand pounds. There
was no remedy but an immediate appeal to Par-
liament : it was made, and, if my memory does
not deceive me, an Act was passed within a week
indemnifying the offenders, and staying all the


adverse proceedings without costs. * The same
course was followed with respect to qui tarn
actions brought against the newspapers about
seven years ago, for having inserted advertisements
of foreign lotteries, which was an infringement of
the Lottery Act imposing a penalty for adver-
tising a lottery. The same also as to actions for
penalties brought against many noblemen and
gentlemen for running more than one horse (the
property of one person) in a race for a Queen?s
plate. Bills of indemnity of a similar character
are of frequent occurrence ; and what is this but
an acknowledgment of the claim which parties have
upon the justice of Parliament, when they have
sustained injury by the operation of law in a way
not anticipated nor intended by its enactment ?
But it may be said that in these cases large
classes of the community were damnified: no
doubt it was because the sufferers were not only
numerous, but influential, that Parliamentary
redress was so promptly obtained. I have not
yet to learn that private individuals may prefer
very just and reasonable claims in vain, unless
backed by popular sympathy or electioneering
power; and it is partly for this reason, and partly
because wrongful convictions are happily so rare,
that so much difficulty exists in finding a precedent
exactly applicable to the present case. I can
supply one, however, where the circumstances were
* A service, by the way, for which only two of the papers to
whom it was good-naturedly rendered, had the grace to thank
me.


XYlll
not very dissimilar, in which also I happened to
be personally engaged. The case of Captain
Robison may still he in the recollection of some
of the older members. That gentleman, after
distinguished service in the Peninsula, was
cashiered on charges which turned out to be
substantially unfounded, and by a court martial
whose proceedings were proved to he unjust. After
five years of fruitless efforts to obtain a revision of
his case, Captain .Robison petitioned the House
of Commons. He obtained a committee up-stairs
to inquire into the merits; the inquiry was pushed
to a certain point, when it was felt that a report
of the result would fully acquit Captain Robison,
and he extremely inconvenient to other personages
of some consideration. A compromise was the
policy of all parties, for Robison had been ruined
in the struggle. The Government consented to
settle the matter without going hack to Parlia-
ment, by allowing him the grants of land to which
he would have been entitled had he not* been
cashiered, and by giving him an appointment in
Ireland as a compensation for the value of his
commission. It is not right to mention this case
without adding, that the gallant officer himself
(and few men had behaved with more gallantry)
was no party to the compromise: it was accepted
for him, and without his knowledge, by the kind
friends who supported his petition.
The case of Lord Cochrane may also tend to
establish the principle for which I am contending,
that a sufferer by unjust prosecution is entitled to
Parliamentary aid in recovering the status from


which it has displaced him, although the verdict
can only he impeached on the ground of error.
Lord Cochrane was restored to his rank of admiral
in the British fleet, and K. 8., and all his arrears
of pay, amounting to a large sum, were paid
up. In one important particular the case of
Mr. Barher is stronger than any that I have
mentioned. The prosecution against him was
instituted hy the Treasury, and the acknowledg-
ment of his innocence has proceeded officially from
the Government, who alone are in full possession
of all the evidence connected with the case. Thus,
in effect, not only the jury who convicted him,
hut the prosecutor who put him on his trial, have
hoth declared his innocence. The jury have
retracted their verdict; the Crown has pardoned
him, ?not in mercy, but in justice. The futile
grounds on which it is attempted to impugn the
grant of pardon, are exposed in the. following
pages. Mr. Barber, then, appeals to Parliament
in the character of one who has suffered injury
far beyond pecuniary calculation, in consequence
of a sentence declared to he unmerited hy the very
parties who were mainly instrumental in obtaining
it. If any wronged subject of the realm can he
entitled to compensation from the public purse,
surely it is one who by the act of the Govern-
ment?an act confessedly though not intentionally
unjust?has been deprived of all, branded with
felonious infamy, and plunged into the very abyss
of human misery.
I have been asked by many why I have not
insisted more on the expurgatorial power of the


royal pardon. My reply is, that it is simply
because the term itself is expurgatorial. It is to
be regretted that our law knows no other form of
recognizing a convict?s innocence : to insist on
the force of a pardon implies, except to a law-
yer, that forgiveness was needed; whereas Mr.
Barber?s case is, that in truth he has done nothing
to be forgiven. Still I incline to think that, in
reference to the administrative functions of our
judges, who, even in adjudicating on the fitness
of an officer of the Court, are to expound the law,
and not to make it, a distinction not always ob-
served in modern times, more effect ought to have
been allowed to the legal operation of a pardon.
? I take it to be settled at this day,? says
Hawkins, (t that the pardon of a treason or felony,
even after a conviction or attainder, does so far
clear the party from the infamy, and all other
consequences of his crime, that he may not only
have an action for a scandal in calling him traitor
or felon after the time of the pardon, but may
also be a good witness, notwithstanding the
attainder or conviction; because the pardon
makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him
a new capacity and credit.? ?Hawk. P. C. iv. 354.
And the same authority says (vol. ii. p. 364),
in reference to a clergyman, ?? A person
admitted to the benefit of clergy is not to be
deprived in the Spiritual Court for the crime for
which he hath had his clergy. Por a pardon
frees the party from all subsequent punishment,
and consequently from deprivation.?


tc It was formerly doubted,? observes Russell,
? whether pardon could do more than take away
the punishment, leaving the crime and its dis-
abling consequences unremoved. But it is now
settled that a pardon, whether by the King or by
an Act of Parliament, removes not only the
punishment, but all the legal disabilities conse-
quent on the crime? ?Russell on Crimes, ii. 595.
Blackstone arrives at the same conclusion, in
almost the same words : ??? The effect of such
pardon by the King, is to make the offender a new
man.??Steph. Comm. iv. 500.
? A pardoned man,? says C. J. Treby, ? is not
guilty; his crime is purged.? ?Vide Cooke?s Case,
4 St. Tr. 748.
Let it be remembered, -that in all these autho-
rities the hypothesis is, that the party has been
indisputably guilty, and rightly convicted of the
offence ; how much more, then, do they apply
to the case of a man pardoned because he is
found, on investigation, to be innocent! It is
difficult to reconcile the judgment of the Court
even with their own view of the merits of the
case: it must be assumed that they considered
that the pardon had been granted under an
imperfect knowledge of the facts; but till the
grant was revoked either by scire facias , or some
other process to which the Crown was a party,
the pardon was valid to all intents and purposes :
its validity could not be impeached by any indirect
process: but while the pardon remained in force, it
necessarily drew after it the conclusion that Mr.


Barber had been improperly convicted ; for it was
granted avowedly on that ground, and not by way
of amnesty for a crime of which he had been
properly found guilty.
But it was his improper conviction, and the
sentence consequent upon it, that laid him under
the necessity of applying to the Court for leave
to renew his certificate; it was, therefore, the
first duty of the Court to give full effect to the
pardon by reinstating him, as far as possible, in
the position from which his improper conviction
had displaced him: after this , the Court might,
correctly, according to its own views, have enter-
tained an application of the Law Society to strike
him off the roll for misconduct. It would still
have been a question, whether the misconduct
charged against him, is such as to justify his
being struck off the roll, even if proved: no
precedent could be found for such a step, and it
is acknowledged to be a doubtful point. There
can be no doubt, however, that to set aside the
pardon altogether, by this anomalous and equally
unprecedented proceeding, is a judicial error.
There is not a single case to be found in the
books, in which the Boyal Pardon has been thus
nullified by the Boyal Courts; and thus new law
has been created (not declared ), as if to found a
plea for punishment in hostility to the prerogative
of the Crown: Mr. Barber?s case is truly unique
in all its points !

PREFACE
TO TRIE FIRST EDITION*
In the month of August, 1850, a friend at the
bar put into my hands the printed statement of
Mr. Barber?s case. I took it up with reluctance, not
only because I was much occupied at the time, but
because my general recollection of the trial in 1811
had left on my mind an impression unfavourable
to Mr. Barber, and that impression had been
strengthened by the confidence which I placed in
the Council of the Incorporated Law Society.
Nor had I any personal interest in the matter, as
I had never seen him in my life, nor in any way
crossed his path in business, though I knew his
firm was considered to be respectable. I avowed
my doubts of his innocence, but, nevertheless, I
was induced, as an act of justice to a member of
my former profession, to read his papers. On
perusing the first ten or twelve pages, I detected,
as I considered, some inconsistencies, which
tended to confirm my prejudices, and I marked
them, with the intention of vindicating the
* I cannot conveniently expunge this preface, because it ex-
plains the manner in which I became connected with the con-
troversy.


adverse opinion which I feared I should be com-
pelled to express. As I proceeded, however, I
began to suspect that I was mistaken ; and when
I rose from the task, it was with the thorough
conviction that Mr. Barber was wholly innocent,
and therefore a much-injured man. I felt that,
as I had in the first instance expressed myself
with some severity, it was only due to Mr. Barber
to avow the total change which his papers had
produced in my opinion. Not being acquainted
with him, or even with his address, I wrote to the
barrister who had introduced the matter to me to
this effect. That letter, though not intended for
general publication, found its way into the Law
Times; and in consequence of its appearance
there, I was requested to take the chair at a
meeting of the profession, which it was proposed
to call at Liverpool, to consider the case. This
meeting was fixed for the 26th of November,
and on the 21st of that month, I was introduced
to Mr. Barber for the first time.
There were many reasons why I should have
preferred seeing some other gentleman in the
chair on that occasion; but being particularly
solicited, I considered it a positive duty to comply,
if, by so doing, I could assist an innocent man in
his laudable endeavour to make that innocence
clear as the light of day. I felt it, however, due
to myself as well as others, before I took so
prominent a part in his behalf, to sift Mr. Barber?s
accuracy as well as his veracity to the utmost.
Hence I noted down every point on which I had


detected seeming error or incongruity, and sub-
jected him to an examination that occupied the
whole of two successive days ; so that at its con-
clusion, he spontaneously observed that in the
many examinations he had undergone, he had
never before been so severely handled. I will be
perfectly candid; I will not say that he left
nothing unexplained, but assuredly he accounted
for every fact and circumstance involving sus-
picion ; and if on minor points he was in two or
three instances at fault, they were not material to
the issue; nor was forgetfulness, after the lapse of
six years, reasonable ground for distrust, even had
they been material. The result of the whole was
a firm conviction that Mr. Barber had acted
honestly from first to last; that his proceedings
throughout had been strictly within the line of
his professional duty; and that consequently he
was an oppressed, deeply injured, and deserving
man; that in this view, he was entitled to claim
not only the sympathy, but the assistance of every
generous mind in either branch of the profession,
and that it would be pusillanimous and unmanly
to withhold it from fear of unreasonable offence.
Having myself been the president of the Metro-
politan and Provincial Law Association, with
duties to discharge analogous to those of the
Incorporated Law Society, I felt it peculiarly
incumbent on me to stand by a former profes-
sional brother, though personally a stranger, in a
case where he seemed to be the victim of error, if
not of ill-will; and which, moreover, tended to


throw a responsibility on the whole profession for
the criminal acts of their clients. If Mr. Barber
acted innocently and honestly as an attorney in
the matters in question?and I firmly believe he
did, a belief which I now find entertained, not
only by the Government, and by the jury which
convicted him, but by the press, and that part of
the profession who have taken the trouble to
investigate the case (who alone can be competent
judges),?then, after such a precedent, no attorney
is safe , and it is by the Council of the Incorpo-
rated Law Society that the whole body of solicitors
is endangered.
Nor can it be denied that the course taken by
the Incorporated Law Society very much resem-
bles an attempt to impeach the grant of the Royal
pardon, by a process ingeniously substituted for
the scire facias in letters patent. Sir George
Grey is certainly one of the last men to require
foreign aid in vindication of his official acts, and
it would be impertinence to tender it; but in the
interval that must elapse before Parliament meets
and this case can be brought before it, much may
be done, and the disposition does not seem want-
ing, to cheat the public into a belief that the
pardon has been solely an act of mercy, and not
of justice. The following pages, if considered
with attention, will, I hope, satisfy the reader that
no alternative was left to a minister of Sir George
Grey?s acknowledged firmness and high-toned
principle, but to advise the immediate grant of a
free pardon to Mr. Barber, however his enemies
may endeavour to neutralise and stultify the Act.


On the perusal of Mr. Barber?s printed case, I
was struck with the inartificial manner in which
it was stated. It was so involved, too, in a laby-
rinth of petty circumstances, that few could find
time to master it, and not many the inclination
to read it. I therefore suggested to him, for the
reasons I have just given, that he should put it
in better and more popular form. He distrusted
his own ability to do this, and requested me to
undertake the task. I assented, hut not until I
had examined the evidence, as well on his trial,
as on his application to renew his certificate.
It is from that evidence that I have obtained
the facts, aided by his own papers, in respect of
facts not disclosed on the trial. It is impossible
to advert to these voluminous papers without
paying a deserved compliment to the high talent
and persevering industry which they exhibit in
his professional adviser, Mr. Stevenson.
Mr. Barber requested permission to publish my
name as the author; if it may be of any service
to him, I should be ashamed of myself if I allowed
any personal feelings to induce me to withhold it.
Possibly it might be more ? prudent ? to conceal
it, but we are not entitled to be anonymously
prudent where an obvious duty of benevolence is
before us. I think it expedient, however, to add,
that I am not the author, nor privy to the
authorship, of any other publication that has
appeared on the same subject.
It only remains to notice, in reference to the
meeting of the solicitors at Liverpool, on the 26th
of November, that it was convened by circular,


XXYIII
addressed to every solicitor in the town. When
the room appeared to be full, soon after the
meeting commenced, I counted forty-six. Many
more entered at intervals, and some few retired.
The best estimate we could form of the number
was sixty; and some gentlemen present assured
me that nearly, if not all, were solicitors. Being
myself a stranger, I could not aver this from my
own knowledge ; but assuming the fact to be so,
it cannot be doubted that the unanimity with
which the resolutions were carried is a fair expo-
nent of the professional feeling of Liverpool on
this subject.
It is not probable, perhaps, that any profit will
arise from the sale of this pamphlet; but should
it happily prove so, it is right to explain that it
is entirely given to Mr. Barber, whose position is
such as to render pecuniary assistance an act of
real kindness as well as duty.

23rd December, 1850,


REVIEW OF THE CASE
ME. W. H. BAKBEE.
PART I.
It is not for its romance alone that Mr. Barber?s
case deserves attention, though that is sufficient
to place it among the causes celebres of the age.
It is pregnant with instruction to all classes, and
more especially to legal men, from the lowest to
the highest rank. Mr. Barber has been tried,
convicted, transported, and, on the ground of
acknowledged innocence, pardoned. It is appa-
rent, that assuming his innocence, he has been
the victim of extreme injustice; his readmission
to his profession is still opposed, because, among
other legal reforms of modern date, solicitors are
hereafter to he placed in the same predicament as
Caesar?s wife?they must not only he immaculate,
hut unsuspected; or, to coin a word to express
the idea more accurately, they must not he ? sus-
pectihle.?
There is no purpose in the following pages to
impute blame to any individual whatever in
reference to this singular case, beyond that cul-


pable carelessness which seems imputable to very
many persons officially or professionally connected
with it. The evidence against Mr. Barber, no
less than the evidence in his favour, is not, to this
hour, understood even by his prosecutors and
opponents, nor has it ever been fairly before his
judges. To assume the contrary, would be to
impute to the former a degree of malice somewhat
exceeding human malignity; and to ascribe to
the latter faults which it would involve a moral
absurdity to suppose, viz., professional incapacity
or judicial partiality. These, happily, have long
been impossible in our courts at Westminster
Hall; but it is proper, also, to set him right with
the public.
Not only the outline, but the substance of Mr.
Barber?s case may be given in few words; had it
not been encumbered with a mass of irrelevant
matter, such general misconception of its merits
could never have prevailed.
It is well known that a large amount of
dividends and principal stock remains unclaimed,
from time to time, in the books of the Bank of
England. It may seem strange to those who are
not blessed with too much property, that any
persons should allow their money to remain
unclaimed, when it may be received with little
trouble. It admits, however, of ready explana-
tion : it often proceeds from mere indolence. An
infirm or sickly party, residing at some distance
from the Bank, and deriving an income more than
sufficient for his wants from other sources, such
as rents or annuities, will leave dividends un-
claimed from year to year, not wanting them, and
considering the money ? safer in the Bank ? than
elsewhere. It is not that fifty or a hundred
pounds is not worth the trouble, but the exertion
of a bustling, wearying journey is great, and it


is put off as an irksome duty, not immediately
pressing. After a year or two the effort is more
annoying, because it involves a search for papers
to ascertain the precise amount. At last the
matter gradually goes out of mind, being chased
away by more absorbing calls upon the attention,
or memory itself being injured by increased
infirmity. Ignorance that such dividends are
due, is a yet more frequent occurrence. A trustee
may have been empowered to receive them; with
that trustee there may he long accounts, which
in mutual confidence have been allowed to remain
unsettled for years ; the trustee, perhaps, is
careless and inaccurate, and neglects or forgets to
get in funds which are not his own ; or perchance
he dies, and years elapse ere the state of the
account is ascertained, and meanwhile the cestui
que trust assumes that all- has been received that
is justly due. Ignorance often proceeds from
absence from England at the time that stock is
specifically bequeathed to the absentee.
In whatever way it may be explained, the fact
is unquestionable, that in a multitude of instances
dividends and principal remain for years un-
claimed, and are carried over to the credit of the
National Debt.
Where dividends have remained unclaimed and
have not been carried over, no difficulty presents
itself to the party entitled. He has simply to
describe the investment accurately and state the
number of dividends for which he applies; he
signs a separate receipt in the Bank books for
every dividend, but no proof of identity is
required. But where a claim is made after the
dividends or the stock has been carried over to
the credit of the Commissioners for reducing the
National Debt, the claimant must make out his
identity and his title.


These preliminary explanations are essential to
a correct understanding of Mr. Barber?s case;
they will enable the general reader to comprehend
the facility of fraud, without incurring much risk
of detection; for if a party has allowed ï¿½l,OOO
stock (or the dividends upon it) to be unclaimed
for many years, he may be presumed to be
ignorant or forgetful of its existence, and is not
likely to ?make a stir? about it, should another
contrive to get possession of it; and if another
can succeed in personating the real owner, so as
to deceive the Bank authorities, it is highly
improbable that the Bank would subsequently
detect the fraud, there being no competing
claimant to arouse suspicion, or awake their
slumbering vigilance. Whether, under such
circumstances, it behoves the Bank to take active
measures for the discovery of the real owners,
before they transfer their property to the national
account, is a moral question, into which it is not
necessary to enter ;* but it cannot be questioned,
that with a view to prevent the spread of infor-
mation which could not fail to offer the greatest
possible impunity to fraud, the custody of the
unclaimed stock hooks should he entrusted to
parties on whose fidelity reliance can be securely
placed, and whose official salaries should he so
liberal as to neutralise temptation. At the time
when the connection began between Mr. Barber
and the real culprit in this case, these books were
in the charge of a Mr. Christmas, who had risen
to this very responsible post from the inferior
station of a Bank inspector.
Mr. Bletcher was a gentleman of wealth and
apparent respectability, residing at Southampton
* I have lately seen such claims advertised in the public
papers ; I presume that this is a reform suggested by Mr.
Barber?s case.?G. S.


Place, Camberwell. He had been a surgeon, but
he bad retired from practice; be was surrounded
by a family of adult children, and be enjoyed that
sort of consideration which is usually given to an
educated man who lives in a quiet way upon a
competency acquired by long professional prac-
tice. Such was the character which Mr. Barber
received of him when an accidental call from Mr.
Eletcher at his office first led to their acquaint-
ance, and induced Mr. Barber to make inquiries
respecting him.
Yet it is not unimportant to mention, that even
at this time, as was afterwards ascertained,
Eletcher had been already engaged in systematic
forgery on the Bank for not less than eleven
years; so easy is it to obtain a respectable footing
in society, as long as the outward decencies of life
are observed. It will hereafter be found that
Eletcher was a consummate actor, and the reader
is requested to bear in mind that such was his
masterly skill, that he had thus cheated not only
the Bank, but all his social circle, and his former
solicitor, for not less than eleven years prior to
his first introduction to Mr. Barber. Eully to
appreciate his dexterity, it must be added that
he had four companions in the frauds (exclusive
of Mr. Christmas, whom the Bank acquitted of
guilty knowledge), and yet evaded all suspicion.
It can be no wonder that he succeeded in duping
Mr. Barber.
It does not appear when the acquaintance
commenced between Eletcher and Christmas, but
there is reason to believe that it was of very long
standing, if not coincident with the first concoction
of the fraudulent scheme. Christmas commu-
nicated to Eletcher, from time to time, the
particulars of unclaimed stock and dividends,
having himself, in his official capacity, obtained


those particulars from the official books. Fletcher
paid him liberally for this information; how
liberally may be inferred from the amount of the
last payment. Christmas received a hundred
pounds for his reward in the last case alone.
The course of Fletcher?s proceedings appears to
have been this. On receiving the requisite infor-
mation from Christmas, his first step was, to
institute bond fide inquiries for the real owner
of the unclaimed stock. If he succeeded, as he
often did, in discovering the party, he made it his
business to ascertain if he was entirely ignorant
of his right to the money, or whether he pos-
sessed a vague impression that there was property
of some kind belonging to him, though unin-
formed of its nature or position.
In the first case, Fletcher could proceed to
fraud without danger; in the second, he made
distant approaches to the party, intimating the
possession of a valuable secret, which had cost
him much labour and expense to obtain; and,
having thus made his terms for the disclosure, he
would then honestly put the owner in the way of
enforcing his rights, and content himself with the
stipulated bonus.
It is sufficiently obvious, that in the latter
course there was no dishonesty, provided the
bonus required did not exceed a reasonable com-
pensation for trouble and expense. Asa question
of taste, there may be very few men in the class
conventionally termed ? gentlemen,? who would
select such a calling as the means of livelihood;
yet, even on the score of respectability, it might
be plausibly urged, that the pursuit of an obsolete
title, for the benefit of the party legitimately
interested, and to the prejudice of no person even
in wrongful possession, is at once an ingenious
and a useful, if not a benevolent occupation. The


late Mr. Nugent Bell made a splendid income by
researches precisely similar, yet his honour was
never impeached on account of it.
In cases where the owner was found in happy
ignorance of his fortune, and never likely to
emerge from it, or where no owner could possibly
be found, Fletcher adopted the expedient of per-
sonating the true owner, and dressing up a tale
to sustain the fictitious title. This was unques-
tionable forgery of the deepest dye. How often
Fletcher may have practised it during the fifteen
years of his systematic crime, is still unknown;
but during the last five years of the term, he was
concerned in four forgeries and five genuine
claims.
In both branches of his business, the dishonest
as well as the honest, Fletcher found that the
assistance of a solicitor was necessary, as well to
secure to himself the stipulated reward for his
services, as to put the title of the claimant in a
producible and intelligible form. It was not
necessary to disclose his fraudulent purpose to the
solicitor, and it would certainly have been very
inexpedient to do so; for even admitting that he
could have found a solicitor willing to become
particeps criminis, it would only have been on
terms of having the lion?s share in the booty. But
the disclosure would have been superfluous ;
whether the claim was honest or dishonest,
genuine or fictitious, precisely the same steps were
proper to sustain it; all the solicitor could do in
either case, would be to say, ? Give me the
evidence of identity, the certificates of birth and
marriage, the letters, the will, or whatever the
documents may be, and I will put them into ship-
shape for you, and tell you what to do next.?
Probably in any insulated case, casually brought
by a daily client, as an occurrence of accidental
p 2


interest, in which he was at a loss how to act, a
solicitor would have gone a step further, and said,
? You don?t understand such matters, you had
better leave it to me to collect the evidence; it
will, to he sure, swell the costs a little, but the
fortunate owner will not mind that when he re-
ceives an unexpected treasure.? But in Fletcher?s
case, who avowedly undertook and prosecuted
such matters to found for himself a reasonable
claim to compensation, all that he could ask, or
consistently allow to be done for him by a solicitor,
was that which required professional skill to do.
Every shilling charged for professional investiga-
tion would, in his view, be a shilling taken out of
his own pocket.
It occurred that shortly after Fletcher?s former
solicitor had retired from practice (and it should
be noticed, that in several previous frauds he had,
as was discovered after his apprehension, employed
a solicitor in a similar way), Fletcher introduced
himself to Mr. Barber, professing a willingness to
assist the claims of a client of that gentleman to
the Angel property, the client having referred him
to Mr. Barber for information'. Mr. Barber,
properly rejecting an offer of money to promote a
claim which he had already sifted and found
untenable, answered with candour, that it would
be a fruitless incurring of costs, and thus the
interview terminated. Mr. Barber was struck
with the apparent benevolence of the offer, and
Fletcher, with the frank honesty of the rejection;
hence the former inquired of a friend, living in
Fletcher?s neighbourhood, what was known about
him, and received the high character of him that
has been already mentioned. Fletcher, on the
other hand, repeated his call shortly afterwards,
to offer Mr. Barber a general retainer as his
solicitor.


It was not likely that a connection thus
auspiciously commenced, would soon he in-
terrupted by distrust. Nor was the business first
brought by Fletcher calculated to excite suspicion
?rather to prevent it. It consisted of settling
agreements and differences with tenants, Fletcher
being their landlord. After this, Mr. Barber was
employed in the investment of capital and change
of securities for him. Nor was it till a year after
the connection commenced that Fletcher intro-
duced one of his cases of unclaimed stock. The
object in this case was to obtain letters of admini-
stration to a party whom Fletcher introduced as
the rightful claimant. This matter having been
disposed of, Fletcher, for the first time, told
Mr. Barber, that ? having the means of obtaining
information at the Bank as to the particulars of
unclaimed stock, he devoted some portion of his
time to inquiry for the owners, and did so with a
view to compensation for his trouble ; but that
professional aid was often necessary to secure
payment of his compensation, and that sometimes
he should want Mr. Barber?s assistance.?
Such a communication as this might, it is
admitted, have awakened distrust had it stood
alone, and been the first subject of a retainer;
but, taken in connexion with the circumstances,
there was nothing in it so extraordinary as to
excite even momentary suspicion. Fletcher?s
character had been ascertained to stand high ;
his business had been respectable, and showed
him to he a man not only possessed of ample
means, hut very close and even parsimonious in
the management of them. Above all, no such
frauds as those which Fletcher had long practised,
and was still contemplating, had yet been known
to the world; nor was it very easy for any man,
however shrewd, if not very conversant with the


habits and economy of the Bank, to see how such
knowledge could bo made subservient to fraud.
Anybody, of course, could perceive that, in some
insulated case, a will might be forged to give a
colourable claim to a supposed legatee; but the
most experienced Old Bailey solicitor, unless
familiar with the Bank system, would not have
suspected from such a communication, any organ-
ised plan of habitual forgery. Even if it had
been possible for such a thought to flash across
his mind, the suspicion would instantly have been
dispelled by Eletcher?s avowal, that it was from
the Bank itself that the information came. Could
any officer of that establishment be plotting
forgery against itself ? Impossible. To this may
be added, that Mr. Barber had never been profes-
sionally engaged in any prosecution for forgery,
nor (except rarely) in Crown business. Perhaps
of the ten or twelve thousand solicitors through-
out the country, there are not a hundred who
have had more experience on this subject. Soli-
citors generally decline it, except it is casually
thrown in their way in connection with the other
business of a valued client.
But it has been observed, that the very avowal
of a private but official source of information,
ought to have put him on his guard. The answer
is twofold. The fact of its being official seemed
to divest its secrecy of criminality; and the very
object of the information was apparently more than
legitimate ?it was benevolent; it was to restore
lost property to its rightful owner ; and though it
might occur, and probably did occur, to Mr.
Barber that it was rather a singular and cir-
cuitous course to effect this object, there was
nothing in the act itself inconsistent with this
assumed benevolence of purpose, and nothing in
the claim of compensation for services necessarily
valuable, that justified him in hinting to a


respected and affluent client, that possibly he
might he contemplating felony ! It is most unfair
and unreasonable to charge want of due caution
in being misled by this retainer, now that its real
meaning has been developed by the result, unless
we can form a judgment unembarrassed by all
that has since transpired; and that is impossible.
Not one of us can truly say, that had he been in
Mr. Barber?s place, he could have inferred even
simple fraud from this announcement; far less a
complicated and ingenious train of forgery, per-
sonation, and robbery, such as, perhaps, never
before was even meditated.*
It has been mentioned that Eletchcr had four
accomplices ; these were William Sanders, Lydia
Sanders (his wife), Mrs. Dorey, and Mrs. Richards,
?all members of one family, Mrs. Richards being
the mother of Mrs. Dorey and Mrs. Sanders.
It may be convenient here to state, that William
Sanders personated one Thomas Hunt; Lydia
Sanders personated one Emma Slack; Mrs. Dorey
personated one Mary Burchard; and Mrs. Richards
personated one Miss Stewart: these four fictitious
characters being essential to the performance of
the felonious drama of which Eletcher was the
author.
The mode of carrying out the fraud was simple,
yet artfully devised. An owner to the unclaimed
stock is found in A. 8., deceased. A will is pro-
duced, dated shortly before the death of A. 8., by
which the stock is specifically bequeathed to a
nephew or some other relative whose actual
* Tlie observation quoted in the text might be entitled to
some weight, if it did not pre-suppose a knowledge on the part
of the recipient that the information could only be imparted
for fraudulent purposes ; whereas it is an every day occurrence
for the Bank clerks to communicate to respectable stock-brokers
the precise form of a forgotten investment; nor could the busi-
ness of the Stock Exchange be easily conducted in many cases
if such facilities were not given.


existence and birth-place had been carefully
ascertained by Fletcher, with a view to his being
afterwards personated by an accomplice. A
fictitious certificate of A. B.?s death is re-
gistered in the parish of which the real owner
is described to be in the Bank books, such
registration being made preparatory to the
fraud, about the time of the alleged death.
A certificate of the supposed legatee?s birth is
obtained; and, finally, an affidavit is made by one
of the accomplices, plausibly accounting for the
delay in claiming the dividends on the stock be-
queathed. Such, mutatis mutandis, was the scheme
of every fraud, and in every instance the necessary
documents were obtained by Fletcher himself?
being the service for which he claimed compensa-
tion. Having obtained or forged them, Fletcher
brought them as honest evidence to Mr. Barber,
to enable him to prosecute the merely technical
formalities of claim and identification at Doctors?
Commons and the Bank.
This brief explanation of the manner of effecting
the frauds, will make the details of each case, and
the bearing of the whole, intelligible to the un-
professional reader. It will at once be understood,
that if Mr. Barber suspected this evidence, he was
a guilty party. If, on the contrary, he honestly
gave credit to it, and received it as bond fide evi-
dence from hands entitled to confidence, he was
as innocent as if the whole transaction had been
genuine. In other words, everything turns on the
bona fides with which Mr. Barber entered upon
and transacted the professional duty. This is, in
fact, the issue now depending. A large portion
of the public, and an influential part of the press,
decided that issue in Mr. Barber?s favour, even at
the time of his conviction. The Government,
after minute investigation, also decided it in his


favour, and granted a free pardon on tlie ground
of proved innocence. The jury which convicted
him have declared their acquiescence in the justice
of that decision. A vast majority of the profes-
sion, both abroad and at home, have confirmed
the decision of the Government; hut there are
among their brethren a few gentlemen ?men of
unquestionable honour and merited consideration
?who have taken an opposite view of the matter,
and opposed his readmission among them. The
Court of Queen?s Bench has adjudged in favour
of this opposition, hut in a judgment which, from
the words of it, proves that the case was not
accurately understood, nor placed fully and fairly
before the Court. Nor could it well he otherwise,
for the most important parts of the evidence were
excluded by an objection which, when explained
hereafter, will he appreciated as it deserves.
An attempt has been unsuccessfully made to
induce the Court to reconsider that judgment, hut
it was confirmed, not, indeed, without a partial
hearing, hut certainly without argument; and in
terms which demonstrated that an entire revision
of the whole case in forensic argument, was neces-
sary to render the matter intelligible to the Court.
Did Mr. Barber receive the evidence and instruc-
tions of Eletcher in good faith ?
Some general remarks seem important as pre-
fatory to this inquiry.
It has been stated that during the last five years
of his career, Eletcher was engaged in nine cases,
of which four involved forgeries, and five were
genuine. He received the professional assistance
of Messrs. Barber and Bircham in all these cases.
Their assistance was rendered openly, and varied
in no respect from the general routine of the office.
Every attendance was duly and fully posted in the
office books, de die in diem; the letters were all


copied in the usual way; the papers lay on the
office table, open to the inspection of all the clerks,
of whom there were not less than seven in daily
and hourly attendance; the costs were made out
in the accustomed form, duly delivered and duly
paid; and every thing was mixed up, as it naturally
would be, with other business of Fletcher?s, and
treated in the same manner. This professional
regularity in the conduct of the business, though
most important in considering the hona fides of
Mr. Barber, does not appear to have attracted the
attention of the Court; no weight is allowed to it,
at all events, in the judgment.
It will be readily conceded that, if it can he
shown that Fletcher successfully practised decep-
tion on Mr. Barber down to any given date in the
history of these transactions, Mr. Barber was in
all probability the dupe, and not the willing
instrument of his frauds, not only to such given
date, but to the very end of their connection.
Of the nine cases in which Messrs. Barber and
Bircham were engaged, the last was one of forgery,
and the only one on which Mr. Barber was con-
victed. It is known as ? Slack?s case.? This
forgery occurred in October, 1842. Mr. Barber
received his first instructions in it on the 3rd day
of October, 1842. It shall he shown that up to
the 20th of July immediately preceding, Fletcher,
beyond all dispute, was acting a part, and stu-
diously deceiving Mr. Barber. In Fletcher?s judg-
ment, then?and he of all men must he considered
the best judge?Mr. Barber was duped, at least till
the 20th of July. It is very material to note this
day with accuracy. It lets in proof amounting to
demonstration, that in all the previous cases of
forgery Mr. Barber was deceived ; and, therefore,
at all events, thus far acting with hona fides.


On the 20th of July, 1842, Fletcher wrote the
following letter to Mr. Barber :
?Southampton Place, July 20th, 1842.
? Dear Sir, ?During my absence this day, a Mr. Griffin, who
is hying at the west end of the town, called at my house to say
that an application has been made to him from Somerset House,
for the payment of the legacy duty in the case of Miss Stewart,
who made a claim to some money in the Bank of England be-
longing to her late brother, who died (if I recollect rightly) at
Great Marlow. You may recollect I recommended to you her
case when you resided in Tokenhouse Yard, which money, after
a good deal of trouble, you obtained for her. The legacy duty,
in that case, I perfectly recollect, was to be paid by you, she
having left, by my request and in my presence, the money for
that purpose with you ; but it appears, by some means, the pay-
ment has been neglected. I did not see this Mr. Griffin, but I
perfectly recollect that he was one of the bail for Miss Stewart
at the Commons ? how he came to make me out in place of you
is a mystery, as I really know nothing of him : perhaps you will
have the kindness to see to this matter, as it appears that Mr.
Griffin is threatened with legal proceedings. I believe that the
old lady (Stewart) died almost directly afterwards, viz., soon
after obtaining the money ; hut I cannot, at the present moment,
inform you how I obtained the information, but I certainly did
hear that she died.
? I am, Dear Sir,
? Your obedient Servant,
? Josa. Fletcher.
It is impossible to read this letter, and not
perceive that it is a somewhat angry rebuke to
Mr. Barber, for allowing the writer, a valuable
client, to be troubled in a matter that concerned
him so little, that he had only a vague, uncertain,
shallow recollection of the subject or the parties.
It is tantamount to saying, ? I wish you would
mind your own business, and not let me be
annoyed by vexatious applications for payment,
from people of whom I know little or nothing
and if it had been a genuine case, and if Mr.
Barber really had neglected a payment for which
G 2


he had received the money, it is precisely the
kind of reproof that might have been expected
from a party who had obliged him by bringing
the matter to his office. Could Fletcher have
written thus to an accomplice ? Had Barber been
a guilty abettor of the fraud, would the letter
have been written at all ? Would not Fletcher
have felt writing imprudent, and have reserved
expostulation for an interview ? Would not the
tone of such expostulation have been rather of
this nature: ?On my word, Barber, you will
involve us all by this carelessness. Why have
you not paid the duty ? For mercy?s sake pay it
directly, or everything will come out.?
Let us now compare this letter with the actual
case. Stewart?s case, to which it alludes, was the
first on which Mr. Barber had been engaged ; it
had only occurred eighteen months previously to
the date of this letter; it involved forgery and
personation, like the others. Miss Stewart, of
whose death he affects ignorance, was no other
than his accomplice, Mrs. Bichards! and ? this
Mr. Griffin,? of whom he really knows nothing,
had been his agent, to prove identity, in a perjured
affidavit, which Fletcher himself prepared ! ! !
When the letter is read, with the knowledge of
these facts, how can we arrive at any other con-
clusion than that the letter was studiously pre-
pared in such terms as to keep up the delusion of
which Mr. Barber was the dupe ? It was essen-
tial that the legacy duty should be paid without
delay. It was desirable that it should be paid by
Mr. Barber?s hand. Hence the letter was written
in this affected, off-hand, indifferent tone, not
daring to urge speedy payment as a precaution
for safety, yet urging Mr. Barber into an instant
settlement of it, by the half-disguised imputation
of something more than negligence.


It has been justly felt that this extraordinary
letter, if sincerely written, entirely exonerates
Mr. Barber from all privity to the frauds up to
that moment, that is, in every case of fraud prior
to the last?for all the rest were prior to its date.
It is the private letter of the arch-felon himself,
to one whom he was conscious he could only
approach on the subject as on a matter of honest
and ordinary professional duty; one who, he was
assured, would he the very first to accuse and to
convict him, if he dropt the least expression to
excite suspicion. Nor is this its only value: such
a letter, under such circumstances, shows the
cool self-possession and excellence in acting of
the writer. Nothing could be better adapted to
sustain the deception. How, then, can it excite
surprise, that in dealing with such an accom-
plished villain, Mr. Barber or any other frank
and unsuspecting attorney should be deceived ?
But it has been said, to rebut this plain and
conclusive evidence, ? That this letter was colour-
able, and written only as a convenient cloak for
Mr. Barber.? It is crushing a fly upon a wheel,
to combat such a far-fetched argument. Colour-
able ! for what ? Had there been a tittle of
evidence to prove a guilty knowledge, surely
such a transparent artifice would have availed
nothing to rebut it. A veil intended to conceal,
must not be reduced to a single thread; if artifice
were intended, there would have been fifty such
letters to produce. The inventors of such a well-
organized conspiracy would not have lacked in-
genuity to spin a closer web; or, is it to be
imagined, that Fletcher, who, from the first,
exhibited implacable resentment against Mr.
Barber; whose confession of his innocence was
withheld till it had been too clearly established
to need his aid; from whom a single word of


explanation, at the proper moment, might have
saved his attorney without committing himself;
is it to he imagined that such a man was plotting
for Mr. Barber?s escape, at the very time when it
was well known that he hoped to effect his own
by becoming evidence for the Crown, should
detection happen ? The very suggestion of such
a motive for the letter sufficiently proves the
weight attached to it by Mr. Barber?s opponents.
It is not easy to explain, or indeed to guess, why
this most important feature in the case passed
unnoticed in the judgment. Can it be that such
a judge as Mr. Justice Patteson, not less distin-
guished by his acuteness than his humanity,
overlooked it ? Lord Campbell disposed of the
case without argument, and may therefore well
be excused for the omission, although, when he
indorsed the former judgment, it seems natural to
expect that he would have first collated it, word
for word with the evidence, for it is for inconsis-
tency with the evidence, and on no other ground,
that the former judgment has been generally
impeached by the profession. In no possible way
can it be accounted for, that such a letter should
have been addressed by Pletcher to an accom-
plice ; but for many and obvious reasons it was
indispensable to write it to an innocent and pro-
fessional agent. It may be emphatically repeated,
that this letter, till proved , as well as suggested
to be a colourable artifice, disposes of the whole
case in Mr. Barber?s favour; it is decisive and
unequivocal; for if Mr. Barber was innocent of
guilty knowledge at its date?that is, the 20th
July, 1842, ?it follows, that he entered upon the
conduct of the ninth case (Slack?s), on the follow-
ing 3rd of October, with the full impression that
he had already successfully managed not less than
eight previous cases, all of which were honest


and genuine. Why, then, should he take up the
ninth with distrust ? Suspicion in the very
slightest degree, under such circumstances, would
have been unnatural and absurd.*
It is true that Mr. Barber does not stand in
need of this argumentative defence. He was
tried on Stewart?s case and acquitted; or, to use
the expressive phraseology of the profession, the
case for the prosecution broke down on its own
evidence; it stumbled over its own legs, like a
foundered horse. This will he seen presently;
but it is useful to introduce these argumentative
proofs of exculpation, because they serve to show,
that whether the case is considered in its general
form and features, or in its minute details, every-
thing leads to the same conclusion?the whole
story is in perfect keeping, on the hypothesis of
Mr. Barber?s entire innocence ; every incident
dovetails in with another; but on the hypothesis
of his guilt, all is unsymmetrical, incongruous,
and disjointed.
Stewart?s case was of this nature.
Unclaimed stock to the amount of ï¿½1,200 stood
in the name of one John Stewart. To obtain this
stock, Uletcher represented that John Stewart
had died intestate, and unmarried, leaving a
* It is worth remarking, in reference to this letter, that it
appears to be the only one that Fletcher ever addressed to Mr.
Barber, or his firm, except a few laconic notes making or re-
voking appointments : yet none could have been easily destroyed
without detection ; for it is admitted that the bill books and
attendance books of Messrs. Barber and Bircham were kept
with accuracy ; they were all inspected by the solicitors for the
prosecution, and it is scarcely necessary to observe that such
books in an attorney?s office, when kept with accuracy, would of
necessity convey to any other attorney of ordinary acuteness, a
knowledge of every important letter that might have been
received in the course of business, even though such letter
should not be found among the papers.


sister, Miss Stewart, who was entitled to the
administration. The deceased, a gardener, died
at Great Marlow, in Buckinghamshire. Mrs.
Eichards acted the part of Miss Stewart, the
sister, and ? this Mr. Griffin ? vouched for iden-
tity. Eletcher, according to his custom, went to
Marlow in May 1840, to collect such particulars
about the late John Stewart as might enable him
to cast the parts. Mrs. Eichards was then taken
to Doctors? Commons, and letters of administra-
tion were granted to her. Eletcher introduced
the matter to a proctor of his own selection, and
the usual administration bond was given, and the
customary sureties provided, before he even men-
tioned the case to Mr. Barber. When the fic-
titious administratrix, however, claimed the stock
on the authority of her letters of administration,
more special information was considered neces-
sary, and in October, five months after Eletcher?s
journey to Marlow, and two months after the
letters of administration had been granted, Mr.
Barber was instructed to prosecute inquiries at
Marlow, of witnesses whose names he had received
from Eletcher. Eletcher knew well enough what
these witnesses would say, as he had fabricated
his case to meet the information they had given
him on his first visit in May. Mr. Barber
accordingly obtained their evidence without dif-
ficulty, being evidence perfectly true and honest,
and with which the fictitious tale had been already
made to square. Assisted by these affidavits, no
further difficulty occurred in getting the stock
transferred to the pretended sister, and the fraud
was consummated.
Even the unprofessional reader will be at no
loss to perceive that a most important feature in
the inquiry, in such a case, would be, whether
Mr. Barber was making this investigation at


Marlow in May or in October; if in the former
month, or early in June, then this justified a sus-
picion of privity to the concoction of the fraud,
as the letters of administration were granted in
August; but if the visit was in October, long sub-
sequent to the grant, a strong presumption would
be raised the other way, as both the forgery of
the administration bond and the utterance of it
had been committed in June.
It was, therefore, essential to the prosecution
to show that Mr. Barber went to Marlow before
the forged bond was executed; and to prove this,
one Hyatt, the landlord of the Greyhound Inn, at
which Mr. Barber had received the witnesses, was
called. Hyatt swore stoutly, that Mr. Barber
was there a fortnight after Eletcher, that is, in
May, or early in June, and at no other time. To
make this evidence tell more strongly, he added,
that Mr. Barber gave him a false name, and
described himself as ? Clarence Beckham, Esq.?
Against such conclusive evidence, who could
hope for an acquittal ? Mr. Barber could, of
course, produce ?and did produce ?his diary and
clerks, to prove that his journey was in October,
and not in May; that he never went to Marlow
but once, and this was admitted by Hyatt; but
the obvious and not unreasonable reply to this
would have been (as to the letter of the 20th
July)?? Oh, the clerk has been tutored, and the
diary prepared.? Happily for Mr. Barber, he
had in Baron Gurney the most keen-sighted judge
that ever adorned the bench, and in Mr. Wilkins,
not then a serjeant, one of the most able counsel
that ever addressed it. More happily still, he
had, on principle, always retained every scrap of
paper connected with his professional duties ; nor
did he lose his presence of mind, sustained as it
was by conscious innocence, even amidst the


breathless and awful anxiety for him, shared
perhaps by the prosecutors themselves, when this
astounding evidence came out.
Mr. Barber?s tavern bill was put in, the date
folded down , and it was handed to the witness.
?Is that your bill ??
?Itis ; it is in my handwriting; the charges
are correct; one of them is for the hire of a
horse to the railway station, five miles off.?
?Did Mr. Barber ever visit you more than
once ??
?No.?
? Are you quite sure that Mr. Barber?s visit
was within a fortnight after Fletcher?s ??
?Yes, of that I am quite certain.?
? And that he was never in your house but
once, and that once not in October ??
? I am positive of that.?
? Then, now look at the date of that bill in
your own handwriting.?
It was dated the 13th of October, 1840 !! !*
Nor was the alleged false description less easily
disproved. Hyatt had told Mr. Barber that he
would soon be in London, upon hearing which
Mr. Barber asked him to call on him with any
additional intelligence he could obtain, adding,
* It is strange that, before calling this witness, the solicitor
for the prosecution did not ascertain whether his books con-
tained any entry of the bill; it seems probable that as the hire
of a horse was among the charges, the books of a respectable
innkeeper would have contained some memorandum of the post-
horse duty : this would have fixed the date. If the witness
did keep books, and no such entry appeared in them, the
omission ought, in fairness to the accused, to have been avowed ;
it is not credible that, where the prosecution was in such ex-
perienced hands, a fact so important, one way or the other,
should have been overlooked. Another remark forces itself on
the mind in reference to this witness ; it is obvious that the
giving a false address was almost as important a feature in his


? My clerk, Peckham, will show you to my house
in Nelson-square, if lam not at the office.? Out
of the words ? clerk,? ? Peckham,? and ? square,?
this blundering innkeeper fabricated the address
?? Clarence Peckham, Esquire,? it being proved
that, on a brass-plate on Mr. Barber?s door, when
Hyatt did call as directed, the words ? Mr.
W. H. Barber, Sol r .,? were engraved in large
letters !! ! It makes the blood freeze to think on
what petty circumstances a man?s life depends
before a jury; but for the preservation of the
tavern bill, and the brass-plate on the door, Mr.
Barber?s inevitable fate, only a few years since,
would have been a public and ignominious death.
As it is, he has suffered worse than death itself,
and by conviction in a case yet less equivocal.
But before we proceed to Slack?s case, it may
be convenient to dispose of the two intermediate
ones; Burchard?s, in May, 1841, where ï¿½1,300
was fraudulently obtained, Mrs. Dorey having
personated Eliza Burchard ; and Hunt?s, in June,
1842, where ï¿½1,500 was fraudulently obtained,
William Sanders having personated Thomas Hunt.
It might be a sufficient notice of these two
cases, to say that the prosecutors refused to try
them, though the other cases which they did try
sufficiently show that they were not wanting in
evidence as the date of Mr. Barber?s visit to Marlow ; but when
he was examined by the solicitors for the prosecution previously
to the trial, they must have ascertained whether, in point of
fact, he had gone to Mr. Barber?s office to inquire for Mr.
Peckham or for Mr. Barber. If he inquired for Mr. Peckham,
he must at once have seen that he was introduced to a different
party, and have avowed his mistake. His natural remark would
have been, ?You are not the ?Clarence Peckham, Esq.,?that
I saw at Marlow the blunder would have been promptly dis-
covered and acknowledged, and not quoteable as a false addx-ess ;
ff, on the other hand, he inquired of Mr. Peckham for Mn
Barbex*, it is clear that no false address was ever given.
H 2


boldness. This was much regretted, as there
were casual circumstances in these abandoned
cases that went far to establish Mr. Barber?s
innocence in all. It would have been proved
that, so far from concealing the transactions, he
had needlessly spoken of them to strangers as
curious anecdotes of fortunes unexpectedly ac-
quired. But there is a peculiar incident in one
of these cases, that of Hunt, which must not pass
without comment; for, strangely enough, it has
been quoted in the judgment as a circumstance
of suspicion, when it appears to have a direct and
important bearing the other way.
In this case, the accomplice, Sanders, personated
Thomas Hunt, as the grandson and legatee of
one Mary Hunt, who had died in 1829, leaving a
will bearing date the same year. She was the
owner of ï¿½1,500 stock, on which no dividends
had been paid since 1806; so that in 1842 there
were thirty-six years? dividends to be received.
When, however, the fictitious grandson applied
at the Bank, he only claimed and only received
twelve years of these arrears; that is to say, he
only received ï¿½4OO, when ï¿½1,200 was actually due.
It is extremely difficult to see in what way this
warranted suspicion on Mr. Barber?s side. In
the first place, there is no evidence whatever?
nor could there be when no trial took place?that
Mr. Barber knew the extent of the arrears. His
own affidavit denies that he did; there is no
evidence that even Fletcher or Hunt knew the
extent of them; and there is no evidence that
Christmas himself did.
But, in the second place, had Mr. Barber or
Fletcher really possessed this knowledge, is it not
obvious that, as guilty men, their policy would
have been the other way, to get the larger sum,
when ï¿½1,200 would be obtained with as little


trouble and risk as ï¿½4OO ? If the fact had been
that they were claiming more than their title
warranted, it might have raised a suspicion of
fraudulent purpose, though somewhat different in
kind; but to claim less than their title vindi-
cated, if it is assumed that they actually knew
the extent of the arrears, provoked suspicion of
the actual fraud. And the most extraordinary
part of the case is, that the Bank should have
paid the twelve years? dividends demanded, and
have retained the twenty-four years? without
asking a single question, or making the slightest
observation ; the obvious suspicion presenting
itself that claimants, who only asked for a third
of the sum in arrear, must be too imperfectly
acquainted with the facts to be preferring an
honest claim.
If the circumstance of the party asking only
for a third of the sum in arrear did not excite
suspicion, it must have been that the Bank was
perfectly satisfied such party was the rightful
claimant, and if he were the rightful claimant,
upon what principle of honesty and fair dealing
was advantage taken of his imperfect know-
ledge of his right and twenty-four years? divi-
dends withheld from him ? ?
The judgment suggests that the mere fact of
thirty-six years? dividends being in arrear at the
date of the will, ought to have excited distrust of
the will! Why so ? Is there any necessary
incongruity between the existence of a will and
non-claim of the dividends on stock bequeathed
by it ? Experienced attorneys could suggest,
from their personal knowledge, many solutions of
the problem. Cases have been known where
disease has obscured the memory till the ap-
proach of death has cleared away the mist. Cases
are not unfrequent where married women have


studiously concealed the existence of stock stand-
ing in their names, of which, as married women,
they dare not receive the dividends till a husband?s
death or the approach of their own has compelled
disclosure. But it is not necessary to resort to
ingenuity for a solution, when the very cases
before us prove the occurrence of the fact. In
Hunt?s case, on which the Court founded its
comment, the parties actually entitled, under a
genuine will, omitted to claim their dividends for
thirty-six years ! llobins?s claim was a genuine
claim; there ï¿½1,500 was received not for a
fictitious but a rightful owner; there, too, there
was a will, and there, too, were many years?
dividends in arrear. This case had been con-
ducted by Mr. Barber, before Hunt?s was brought
to him. Why was he to suspect in one case
more than another ? Yet, if he had entertained
suspicions in Bobins?s case, it is clear they would
have been unfounded and unwarrantable.
Suppose it had been Mr. Barber?s better for-
tune to be concerned for the true owner of Hunt?s
stock (as he was in other cases), with its thirty-
six years? arrear of dividends, and he had, from
the fact of such arrear, suspected fraud, such
suspicion would obviously have been groundless.
This is not the only instance in which the court
seems to have insisted on the propriety of sus-
picion, arising from the non-claim of dividends
in arrear, now and then adding the remark, that
?it does not appear? that the real owner had
other sources of supply. It might be sufficient to
rejoin that the contrary does not appear either,
and that the fair presumption in every case, where
dividends are unclaimed for any length of time,
is, that the owner is well provided with other
resources. But the argument necessarily goes for
nothing, so long as there is an octavo in existence


filled with a list of unclaimed dividends. The
number is infinitely too great and too notorious,
to leave room for suspicion of anything peculiar
or unusual in any given case. If a non-claim
of dividends is remarkable, surely a non-claim of
principal is infinitely more so. It is exactly
twenty times more unaccountable that the owner
should, for a year, forget that he possessed
ï¿½I,OOO, than that he was entitled to receive ï¿½SO ;
yet in no less than seven casï¿½s before Hunt?s,
Mr. Barber had positive proof that the ownership
of such sums had been forgotten. On what ground,
then, was he to suspect in the eighth case ?
These are not questions of law, but of common
sense, on which any layman is as competent as
a lawyer to form a sound opinion.
To proceed with the narrative.
The last of the nine cases in which Mr. Barber
was engaged, was the case of Miss Slack. In this
matter he was tried and convicted. After the
lapse of more than three years, his innocence was
established, and he received a free pardon. He
returned to England, and applied for readmission
to the profession. His application was opposed
successfully by the Incorporated Law Society, or
rather by the Council that govern it; and the
ground of opposition on which the adverse judg-
ment seems to have proceeded was, that though
innocent of criminal privity, the circumstances of
the case, taken in connection with the others,
were so calculated to excite suspicion, that he
must be deemed too careless of reputation as a
solicitor to be a fit person to entrust with pro-
fessional duty. Neither these words, nor any of
similar purport, are to be found in the judgment,
but it is one of the peculiarities of the judgment
(one scarcely knows what decorous expression to
find for it), that it is difficult to determine what


it does mean. Either Mr. Barber was wilfully
blind to Eletcher?s guilt, or he was not: if he was
wilfully blind, he was criminal; if he was not
wilfully blind, he was innocent, and there is
neither authority for the dictum, nor common
sense in the idea, that a man is unfit for the pro-
fession because he has been deceived.*
Such being the position of Mr. Barber in respect
of Slack?s case, it is necessary to enter into a close
examination of it; reminding the reader that it
has been shown, both by the letter of Eletcher of
the 20th July, 1842, and by the circumstances in
detail, that in all the preceding business of Mr.
Barber connected with unclaimed stock, he was
necessarily and demonstrably innocent. We are,
therefore, not only warranted, but compelled by
every principle of justice, to take up the case of
Slack as an insulated case, to be determined on
its own merits alone; or, more correctly speaking,
with this strong ground for presuming the inno-
cence of Mr. Barber in limine , that he had already,
so far as he knew, and had reason to believe,
conducted to a successful issue eight genuine and
honest similar matters, in which, at the instance
* It is satisfactory to find that Lord Campbell, on refusing
the rule on the 4th of June, 1851, entirely adopts this view,
and in terms nearly approaching to those in the text :?? Had
Barber been merely the dupe of Fletcher, God forbid that he
should have been debarred from the exercise of his profession,
even if he were chargeable with a high degree of indiscretion
and supineness.? The judgment of Lord Campbell has been
reviewed in the preface ; it is superfluous to repeat the argu-
ment, but it is expedient to remind the reader that it now
stands admitted by the highest authority, that the only point
in dispute is, whether Mr. Barber was a dupe or an accomplice ;
in other words, whether the pardon, which was avowedly based
on proofs of entire innocence, was properly or improperly
granted.


of Fletcher, property to a large amount had been
recovered for its rightful owners.
On the 3rd of October, 1842, Fletcher called on
Mr. Barber, and informed him that a sum of
ï¿½3,500 stock was standing unclaimed in the name
of ? Anne Slack, of Smith-street, Chelseathat
he had ascertained that there was a lady of the
same name living with Captain Foskett, of Abbotts
Langley ; and he instructed Mr. Barber to com-
municate with the captain, and ascertain whether
the lady residing with him was the party entitled,
and aware of her rights; but in executing these
instructions, he cautioned Mr. Barber not to
disclose the nature of the property. It need
scarcely be observed, that such a disclosure might
have enabled Miss Slack to recover it without
paying Fletcher for the trouble and service he
professed to render, and this was of itself a
sufficient reason for obeying such instructions,
not to mention the possibility of tempting a party
not entitled to set up an adverse claim.
At the same interview, Fletcher stated to
Mr. Barber his impression that the real owner of
the stock was dead, as he had found at Somerset
House that a lady of the same name had died at
Bath. He thus conveyed to Mr. Barber the im-
pression, that while there was a possibility that
Miss Slack, of Abbotts Langley, might be the
owner, it was more probable, there being a long
arrear of unclaimed dividends, that the real owner
Was dead, and that she was to be found in the
party whose death at Bath he alleged to be
registered at Somerset House..
Under the impression thus artfully made,
Mr. Barber, on the following day ?namely, the
4th October, 1842 ?addressed the following letter
to Captain Foskett; ?


? 28, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars,
?4th October, 1842.
? Sir, ?We have occasion to ascertain who is the legal per-
sonal representative of Anne Slack, formerly of Chelsea,
spinster. As we are informed you intermarried with some
member of that lady?s family, we should feel obliged if you
can inform us who are her executors, administrators, or other
legal representatives* (Signed)
u Barber and Birch am.?
Erom the 4th of October to the 31st of No-
vember, the correspondence between Mr. Barber
and Captain Eoskett continued, Mr. Barber
endeavouring, unsuccessfully, to see the captain at
Brighton on the 22nd of October. As this corre-
spondence contains nothing calculated to throw
additional light on the subject, it is unnecessary
to introduce it. At length, on the 21st of
November, Mr. Barber succeeded in obtaining an
interview with Captain Eoskett, that gentleman
having called at the office, at Mr. Barber?s
request.
In the course of the correspondence, or at this
interview (it does not clearly appear which),
Captain Eoskett told Mr. Barber that Miss Anne
Slack, his sister-in-law, had once lodged in Smith-
street, Chelsea. Mr. Barber reported this circum-
stance to Eletcher, as he did every particular that
he learnt. Captain Eoskett had at the same time
said that his sister-in-law was about twenty-seven
years of age.
On receiving these facts from Mr. Barber,
Eletcher affected, and probably really felt, a doubt
as to her identity with the party entitled; for he
had ascertained, through Mr. Christmas, that the
real owner of the stock had executed a power of
attorney to receive the dividends at least twelve
years previously. It was clear that this could
not have been done by a lady only twenty-seven
in 1812; he therefore suggested to Mr. Barber


the expediency of obtaining her signature, that by
comparing it, through the aid of Mr. Christmas,
with the power of attorney, the identity might
be ascertained.
The suggestion was apparently an honest one,
and Mr. Barber followed it; the signature of Miss
Slack was obtained through her solicitor, and
transmitted by Mr. Barber to Fletcher. Fletcher
got it compared by Christmas, and Christmas
reported to Fletcher that it corresponded. So at
least he swore at the trial.
But it would not have suited Fletcher to give
this result to Mr. Barber, who, though much
staggered by the age of twenty-seven, had already
inclined to the opinion that there could scarcely
be two Anne Slacks residing in Smith-street,
Chelsea, both stockholders. Fletcher felt that
his fate hung upon a thread. It was indis-
pensable to keep up the delusion in Mr. Barber?s
mind. He therefore affected to read a letter from
his ? friend at the Bank? (taking good care not
to show it, and never from first to last revealing
the name of Mr. Christmas), to the effect that
Miss Slack?s signature wholly differed from the
stockholder?s, the latter being in a stiff upright
hand, instead of the elegant fluent character of
Miss Slack. He also added to this falsehood the
truth that Miss Slack did hold ï¿½6,000 in the
Funds, though it was, as he said, clear that she
could not be the owner of the unclaimed ï¿½3,500.
This removed all doubt previously existing and
avowed to exist in the mind of Mr. Barber; and
how could it be otherwise ? Captain Foskett had
already stated that his sister-in-law was only
twenty-seven; therefore she could not have exe-
cuted a power of attorney twelve years before.
There was no probability that a young lady would
be aware that she possessed ï¿½6,000 stock, and yet
i 2


be ignorant that she had ï¿½3,500 more. If she
received the dividend of the one sum, how could
she forget to claim the dividends of the other ?
The inference that she had no title was irre-
sistible, and it was a much easier hypothesis that
there had been two Anne Slacks, of Smith-street,
Chelsea, both being fundholders, though of dif-
ferent amounts. It may be fairly doubted if
there be ten men in England, possessed of
common sense, who would not have arrived at
the same conclusion. Mr. Barber returned Miss
Slack?s signature to Mr. Baxter, her solicitor?
apprised Captain Eoskett of the result of the
comparison?and then dismissed the matter from
his mind. This was on the 4th of January. The
entry posted at the time, in Mr. Barber?s diary, is
literally copied as follows :
? 1843.
? January 4. He Slack, Mr. Fletcher, handwriting not the
same. Letter to Mr. Baxter returning Miss Slack?s
letter, long conference, de future measures, and advising
de advertisement.?
Erom this day to the 18th of January there was
no intercourse or correspondence with Eletcher.
It may be observed, however, that Mr. Barber did
talk over the subject with his partner Bircham,
and expressed his surprise at the coincidence
of names and residence. But they were both
equally of opinion that the presumption raised by
such coincidence was completely rebutted by the
disagreement in age and handwriting. All idea,
therefore, of this lady being entitled was wholly
dismissed from their minds.
During this fortnight, Eletcher went to Bristol,
where his confederates, the Sanderses, were living,
and, as subsequently appeared, arranged with
them the fictitious registration of the death of an
?Anne Slack,? at Bath. His first idea was, that


Mrs. Sanders should claim the stock in the name
of ?Jane Slack,? niece of the supposed Anne
Slack, of Bath ; and, in pursuance of this plan,
he caused an advertisement for the representatives
of Anne Slack to he inserted in the Bath and
Cheltenham Gazette , referring inquiries to Messrs.
Barber and Bircham?s office. It was arranged
that Mrs. Sanders should present herself to those
gentlemen, in consequence of this advertisement,
and introduce herself to them as Jane Slack, the
niece of the deceased lady, while Fletcher was to
return to London and report himself as arriving
from Bath, and having there at length succeeded
in his inquiries. Lodgings were taken for Mrs.
Sanders at Bath to carry on the deception. She
applied to Messrs. Barber and Bircham in answer
to the advertisement, describing herself as Jane
Slack, and a correspondence was then begun with
her of similar import to that which had previously
taken place with Captain Foskett. This act of
the drama occupied some time; it began on the
24th of January, and continued till the 4th of
March. About this time, however, Fletcher dis-
covered that there was an error in the registration
of the fictitious certificate of death which made it
unsafe to carry it any further. The nature of this
error has never been disclosed ; but the pretended
Jane Slack, of Bath (otherwise Mrs. Sanders),
abruptly withdrew her claims, on the pretext of
conviction that she was not the rightful party,
and there closed the correspondence. The entry
then made in Mr. Barber?s diary is as follows:
? Mar. 4. Re Slack. The lady at Bath had no claim to the
ï¿½4,000, not being the same. Instructions to advertise for legal
representatives.?
It was Mr. Barber himself who suggested to
Fletcher the expediency of advertising in the


Times , instead of an obscure provincial paper;
and his own clerk prepared and inserted the
advertisement.* It was probably the circumstance
of the error in the registration at Bath that com-
pelled Fletcher to change the venue to Chelsea.
The advertisement brought several applications,
and, among others, a letter from a Mr. Offley,
mentioning Miss Slack, of Abbotts Langley. This
was on the 10th of March, and Mr. Bircham (not
Mr. Barber) answered it the same day, informing
Mr. Offley that they had already ascertained that
she was not the party entitled. No notice, how-
ever, was taken of the advertisement by Miss
Slack herself, nor by any of her friends except
Mr. Offley. The fair inference is, that she was
herself satisfied that she had no interest in the
matter; but it is certainly most unaccountable that
up to this time, and after having had her atten-
tion so pointedly called to her property, though
not to the specific sum, she should still have for-
gotten her execution of the power. No attempt
has ever been made to explain this singular cir-
cumstance, but it must have aided much in keep-
ing up the delusion under which both Mr. Barber
and Mr. Bircham laboured, as well as in assuring
Fletcher and Christmas of impunity, they being
the only two persons actually aware of her
identity ; for of that, the comparison of her hand-
writing must have satisfied both.
As the advertisement led to many inquiries,
* The circumstances of the two advertisements deserve
especial notice. Fletcher selected a country paper, in which it
was extremely improbable that Captain Foskett, or his sister?s
solicitor, would see it. But Mr. Barber suggested the Times,
in which, of all papers, it was most likely to meet the eye of
Miss Slack?s friends, as in fact, proved to be the case ; and
Fletcher?s not daring to oppose this suggestion, though so
dangerous to his scheme, shows that he was above all things
cautious not to awaken suspicion in his solicitor.


which a pressure of business obliged Mr. Barber
to leave to the care of his partner, Bletcher felt
that be had no time to lose. Therefore, on the
15th of March, he called at the office, and informed
Mr. Barber, that he had at last found the party
entitled. In the interim, he had called up Mrs.
Sanders from Bath, placed her in lodgings at 7,
Brancis-street, Tottenham-court-road, and well
tutored her in her part. He explained the means
by which he had made the discovery in a way that
seemed plausible and natural. He had lately
purchased some houses in Westminster, of which
Messrs. Barber and Bircham had prepared the
conveyance; and it was well known to them that
he was himself superintending the repairs of the
property. He told Mr. Barber, that ? among his
labourers he had found a man that lived at
Chelsea, who, being a bricklayer, might he well
supposed to be acquainted with the names of
people occupying houses there. By this man he
had been guided to the house in Smith-street,
where Anne Slack had resided, and on inquiry
there, had been directed to Brancis-street for a
relative of the deceased lady. In this relative,
one Emma Slack, he discovered the niece of the
stockholder; she seemed to be a highly respectable
woman, but unfortunately for him, was aware of
her rights, as she had in her possession the will
of her aunt, in which this very stock was be-
queathed to her. She had intrusted him with
the will to compare the signature with the
power, and they were evidently the same hand-
writing.? On telling this plausible tale, Bletcher
feigned much disappointment, as ?he should get
nothing by it,? but added, ? she does not appear
to be particularly connected with a solicitor, and
I will recommend her to your firm.?
If the reader will recal to mind the prelimi-


nary explanation, he will perceive that on this
statement of facts there were several matters to
be transacted which properly fell within the pro-
vince of a solicitor. The obtaining probate of the
will was the office of a proctor in Doctors? Com-
mons ; but when this was done, it was still neces-
sary to prepare a proper written application to the
Bank; and such a statement of the case, and
evidence in support of it, as would satisfy any
scruples that might be raised, arising from the
long delay in receiving the dividends: hence the
suggestion of her requiring a solicitor did not
appear unreasonable; and certainly no solicitor
would refuse an introduction to a new client, who
was about to be put in possession of more than
ï¿½4,600, which might want investment. But
Fletcher?s object was simply to usher in her claim
under respectable chaperonage. He not only did
not require professional aid, but he took care to
supersede it by anticipation. He had already
secured a certificate of burial; he stated that he
had already tested the will in the surest way, by
comparison of the handwriting with the power of
attorney; and he vouched for its authenticity on
this ground. And as to identity of person, how
could that be called in question ? She had been
know n at Smith-street as Emma Slack, and traced
by that name to the lodgings where he found her,
and, above all, she actually had the w ill in her
possession; from whom could she have received
it but from her aunt ? Thus Mr. Barber found
himself recommended to a duty which was done
to his hand, except as regarded explanation to the
lady of the little customary routine and forms of
office; and, in fact, he did no more, as the diaries
of himself and his partner sufficiently testify, un-
less it was to secure to Fletcher repayment of the
probate duty, which he had advanced, and a very


trifling remuneration of ï¿½5 for his alleged ser-
vices and the temporary use of his money. Mr.
Barber introduced her to his proctor; perused
the will, and the certificate of her aunt?s death
(both of which she produced herself); made a
fruitless inquiry at Pimlico to ascertain the name
of the parish where the aunt died; conferred on
one occasion with Pletcher on the evidence that
might be wanted to support the application, or to
meet conflicting claims, should any arise; wrote
with notice that the probate had been obtained,
and requiring her signature to an application for
the transfer; attended her when she signed it;
made appointments with her and Pletcher to re-
ceive the money; wrote down for her the form
in which it was to he paid; carried a hag of gold ,
weighing 10 Ihs. or more , from the Hank counter
to the carriage ; and finally settled her account
with Pletcher, and his own for costs.
All these particulars are taken from his diary,
except those printed in italics, and this diary was
posted at the time. Two or three similar entries
are found in Mr. Bircham?s diary, especially an
attendance to leave the probate at the Bank.
Was it possible for any solicitor, however emi-
nent or respectable, to do more or to do less ? If
the complaint against Mr. Barber had been that
he charged the client ï¿½l3 for doing next to no-
thing for her, there might have been some pretext,
on such grounds, for opposing his readmission,
according to modern usage ; but assuredly, in
reference to the business which he transacted,
either previously or subsequently to his introduc-
tion to the pretended Pmma Slack, in regard to
this unclaimed fund, it was such as would have
been undertaken and similarly conducted by every
attorney on the roll, who had leisure to accept
retainers on matters comparatively trifling.


This concludes the narrative of Mr. Barber?s
professional connection with the case; hut it is
necessary to mention some particulars which have
an important hearing on the question, in what
light Mr. Barber?s connection with it should he
regarded ? Whether its professional character
was simulated, or bond fide and sincere ?
The appearance of Mrs. Sanders, in the assumed
character of Emma Slack, was stiff and precise;
she was dressed in mourning; wore light-coloured
hair (her own being black), and her age seemed
thirty-five. She affected to complain of gout in
her hands and feet, and accounted for her delay
in proving the will (being, however, only twenty-
seven days) on the ground of serious illness, of
which she seemed to bear evident traces. It was
this apparent debility, as well as natural polite-
ness to a lady and a new client, that induced Mr.
Barber to note down for her in pencil the form in
which she wished to receive the money at the
Bank, and then to carry for her the heavy bag of
six hundred sovereigns. Immediately after she
left the Bank, Eletcher accompanied her to
Messrs. Barber and Bircham?s office; for, of
course, he would not trust an accomplice long
out of his sight with all the booty in her posses-
sion. At the office Mr. Barber produced his bill
of costs, amounting to ï¿½l3. She paid this libe-
rally by giving him ï¿½ls. She then paid back to
Eletcher the ï¿½BO, which he had advanced for the
probate duty, and added ï¿½5 as compensation,
which he took with well-assumed dissatisfaction.
Lastly, she signed an acknowledgment of the set-
tlement in Mr. Barber?s office books, and then
went away in the cab with all the rest of the
money, and still accompanied by Eletcher.
The reader will judge for himself how far it is
likely that all these formalities would have been


observed between three felons sharing their spoil;
and especially when no stranger was present to
comment on their omission. If Mr. Barber was
acting bond Jide , every step was necessary; if he
was acting as an accomplice, all this parade of
business forms was a mere farce, as absurd as it
was superfluous, and carried on for their own
exclusive amusement.
She was identified at the Bank, not by Hr. Bar-
ber, but by a stockbroker known to Hr. Baiber.
The stockbroker merely asked Hr. Barber if she
was the executrix, to which he very naturally
replied, ? Undoubtedly ; I saw her prove the
will.? All this time Eletcher was waiting in the
Botunda, where he had promised to meet them,
on the pretext of looking after the repayment of
his ï¿½BO, but most probably under the -impression
that if he lost sight of her after she had received
the money, she would have easily shaken off Hr.
Barber, and have decamped with the whole.
One further remark is necessary. At one of
his interviews with Captain I oskett, probably that
of the 17th December, Hr. Barber was particular
in inquiring as to his sister-in-law s age. Captain
Eoskett stated that she was but twenty-seven.
Mr. Barber, who had by this time been informed
of the existence of the power, gave him as broad
a hint as he could do, consistently with his in-
structions not to disclose the nature of the pro-
perty, by saying cc Eorty would do. As his sister-
in-law was actually thirty-seven, this was ap-
proaching very near the mark; but Captain
Eoskett was too dull to take the hint, and neither
then nor subsequently (at least not till cross-exa-
mined at the Old Bailey) corrected this misstate-
ment. How very far Hr. Barber had gone in his
explanations, without actually violating his in-
structions, may be inferred from this fact, that
k 2


when Captain Eoskett returned to his carriage, in
which Miss Slack was actually waiting for him,
at the office-door, he asked her, ? Can it be pos-
sible that you have forgotten to receive any of
your dividends ??* It seems certain that Mr.
Barber must have gone to the utmost extent to
open their eyes, and consequently that he is
chargeable with no fraudulent wish to put them
off the scent.
The romance of the story now begins; but be-
fore we enter upon it, let us take a brief review of
Mr. Barber?s position and conduct, up to the
present stage of this extraordinary affair.
It is on the facts already stated, that Mr.
Barber?s guilt or innocence depends, and on which
alone the issue ought to have been put to the
jury; for though a circumstance that subse-
quently occurred was strongly pressed against
him, namely, his temporary refusal to give up his
client?s name when the forgery was detected,
there will be no difficulty when, in the course of
the narrative, we arrive at that part of the case,
in convincing the most prejudiced opponent that
this temporary concealment was more in his
favour than against him.
On the facts already stated, then, was Mr.
Barber guilty or innocent ? or, in other words,'
was he acting bond fide as a solicitor, or, under
the mask of his professional character, Imoicingly
aiding the commission of a felony ?
It is unjust to Mr. Barber to put the case less
broadly. The public cannot and will not enter
into the fine-drawn distinction between actual
and criminal privity, and unguarded, and there-
* This important fact came out on tlie examination of Miss
Slack herself at the Mansion House, but it was suppressed or
forgotten by Capt, Foskett at the trial.


fore culpable, confidence in his client; even the
profession itself does not understand this distinc-
tion: wherever the matter is discussed out of
court, whether among the laity, the solicitors, or
the bar, whether in dining-room conversation, or
in the periodical press (and of late it has provoked
discussion everywhere),?the question is invari-
ably put on this broad and intelligible ground,
?was he guilty or innocent ?If innocent, he is
the most injured and oppressed man in her Ma-
jesty?s dominions; if guilty, he richly deserves
even a worse fate than has befallen him, if that
be possible.*
* The judgment of Lord Campbell has already been noticed r
His Lordship not only recognizes, but freely adopts, the position
in the text, and has treated the issue as one of guilt or inno-
cence. I might, therefore, have abridged some of the remarks
wluch I have here made, but I am unwilling to do so, because I
have had most abundant proof that the pamphlet as it was.
originally written, has converted many to Mr. Barber?s side, and
it is probable that I should weaken its efficiency if by any con-
siderable erasures I disjointed the argument or the narrative.
As the case on which Mr. Barber was convicted is now
brought to its conclusion, this is a convenient place to notice a
suggestion which has been made to me by some parties in whose
judgment I have much confidence it has been said that the
case which has been made out for Mr. Barber is so strong and:
conclusive that it is impossible to believe in its perfect accuracy,
or to reconcile it, if accurate, with the adverse judgment of the
Court; that, consequently, I should prove its accuracy by intro-
ducing a full report of the trial. It might be a sufficient answer
to quote the words of one of our most eminent public men,
himself an ex-judge of the highest rank, whose name, however,
I have not yet obtained permission to publish, though I have
asked it, that ? I have stated the case so fairly, that he felt he.
had both sides before him as clearly as if he had heard counsel
on both.? But it is better to state frankly my reasons for not
following the suggestion. To introduce an abstract of the trial
would expose me to the charge of garbling the report: to in-
troduce the whole would not only be very expensive, but make
the pamphlet so bulky that it would not be read. And, to a
certain extent, the republication would be useless, even for the
end suggested. Few who are not practised lawyers can peruse


We may collect from the preceding narrative,
which has been prepared, not from Mr. Barber?s
statement, but from the evidence, that through-
out, his acts were the acts of a solicitor, and
strictly professional in their character. He was
retained as a solicitor to transact the general
business of a client, embracing, among other
matters, a frequent, but still an occasional, in-
quiry into titles to lost property; it being con-
fessedly one of the habitual pursuits of his client to
benefit himself by discovering the rightful owners.
So far, was there anything criminal ?
It must be admitted, and it is an admission
that has been publicly made by his warmest advo-
cates, that such a business, taken by itself, is not
of a description that solicitors of the highest
class would undertake; that it affords an oppor-
a long trial and collect the merits of the case at a glance :
they become bewildered and confused by the multiplicity of
detail, and rise from the perusal with the yawning exclamation,
? I don?t know what to make of it all.? The cotemporaneous
report of it has long been before the world. Mr. Barber has
enemies who would only have been too glad to prove my inac-
curacy in any important fact. They have never ventured to
challenge it, and till they do I am fairly entitled to credit for a
correct version of the case ; and this silence warrants also the
inference that they feel the arguments to be as conclusive as the
premises are accurate. It was impossible for me, without being
guilty of marked pusillanimity, to avoid strong comments on
the conduct of the Law Society, of the Bank, of Mr. James
Breshfield, of the general conduct of the prosecution, and, by
necessary implication, on far more important personages. To
affect ignorance of these remarks is impossible ; the call for a
third edition proves that they have been read. I have had
transmitted to me nearly forty newspapers and other periodicals
in which the pamphlet has been noticed. I know, from unques-
tionable authority, that the Council of the Law Society has had
it before them ; yet it is now ten months since the first publi-
cation, and, so far as I have seen or heard, nobody has ever
attempted a contradiction or a reply. Such remarkable silence,
under such circumstances, admits of but one explanation, that
Mr. Barber?s enemies feel the case, as here stated, to be unan-
swerable and unimpeachable.


tunity for fraud, or, at least, opens temptation to
fraud, as is proved by the very case before us.
But all solicitors are not of the highest class, nor
is it desirable that they should be. Such men
disdain to act in many branches of the profession,
in which, nevertheless, professional service is
absolutely indispensable. Almost all the profes-
sion reject criminal business ; a large proportion
repudiate insolvency business ; many, even among
the second or third-rate houses, refuse bankruptcy
business; not many will even undertake parochial
business; and, strange as it may sound to the
uninitiated, a very large number decline common
law business altogether.*
* Much comment has been made on this admission, as if it
were, in some degree, unfair to Mr. Barber, and especially when
proceeding from the pen of his advocate. I have considered
and re-considered the passage most attentively, but, after the
fullest reflection, I cannot expunge it. I do not mean, in the
slightest degree, to qualify my assertion that such business is
perfectly honest and legitimate. lam confirmed in that asser-
tion by the opinion of many eminent solicitors, and even of
barristers of high standing, communicated to me since the last
edition was published. Still, on such a matter, I must be care-
ful not to .compromise myself. I would never have undertaken
such business where I had reason to believe that it was followed
by my client as a trade. Few men, however, have had my op-
portunities of acquiring experience in our Criminal Courts, and
it would be most unjust, therefore, to judge a young and inex-
perienced man, as Mr. Barber then was, by a standard which
would reasonably enough be applied to a solicitor educated, as X
have been, in daily prosecutions, and professionally familiar
with the statistics and economy of crime. I have more fully
explained my reasons for repudiating such business in a subse-
quent note. But even my experience in criminal practice would
scarcely have availed me to detect such an accomplished rogue as
Fletcher; and, after all, it should be borne in mind that Mr.
Barber had reason to suppose, from Fletcher?s general business,
that the tracing out of owners of unclaimed stock was but an
Occasional, and by no means his chief, employment. In the
whole year prior to Mr. Barber?s apprehension, Fletcher
introduced to Messrs. Barber and Bircham?s office but one Bank
case, the law charges in which were but ï¿½13., whilst the bills of
costs of the firm for that year amounted to ï¿½3,400.


But to come closer to the point: it has been
answered, and fairly, to this objection arising
from the peculiar character of the business in
which Mr. Barber engaged, that the same objec-
tion would extend with equal force to every
retainer from a bill-discounter or a pawnbroker;
hut are bill-brokers and pawnbrokers to be de-
nied ail professional assistance ? The same objec-
tion would apply with greater force to offenders
against the law, hut are thieves and felons to he
debarred the service of an attorney ? Nor is it
undeserving of consideration, that assuming a
case to he sound and honest, there is a moral as
well as a professional obligation to accept the
retainer; for the professional service is in aid of a
positive good, in restoring his rights or his pro-
perty to a party wrongfully deprived of them.
But if there was nothing wrong in undertaking
business of this description, was it criminal to
repose confidence in the client who brought it ?
This, too, has been urged against Mr. Barber,
though it seems an objection of the hair-splitting
family. If the business in itself was not im-
proper, why should the party who brings it be
suspected ?
But we will not evade the argument; it shall
be boldly met. We reply, that the measure of
confidence that may properly be reposed in any
client depends on the circumstances of each case.
If a stranger, of whom I know nothing, comes
to me with instructions for an ejectment against
the Marquis of Westminster or the Duke of
Bedford, I feel distrust and surprise, especially if
he is dressed in rags, and lays claim to a mansion
in Belgrave-square; but if his pretensions are
limited to some hovel on the Grosvenor estate,
my surprise is gone, though some little distrust
may remain. If I inquire about the man, and


am told by a client that, for his station in life, he
bears a good character, is industrious, and main-
tains a family in decency, my distrust vanishes;
I assume that he has sustained injury, fancied or
real, and, making just allowances for the exagge-
rations of an angry man, I receive his statements
as true, and feel it a duty to discredit the con-
flicting story even of his Grace?s solicitor.
To put another case. If a man previously un-
known to me brings me half-a-dozen over-due bills
to sue upon, and when I inquire how he came by
them, he can give no better answer than that he
is the bond fide holder no matter how, I distrust
him, especially if they are of large amount and
covered by respectable names. 111 find he is not
in trade, my suspicions are the more excited; he
may be the agent of some man who has stolen
them ; he may have obtained them in some gam-
bling or swindling transaction, or they may be
altogether forgeries. I pause before I act on his
instructions, even if I refrain from kicking him
out of my otfice. But if the same man was intro-
duced to me in other matters, if I knew on good
authority that he was in fair repute, and if I had
successfully enforced payment of other bills for
him, and learnt by years of professional inter-
course that he was affluent, shrewd, and versed in
the business of the world, I should ask no other
question than what might relate to the solvency
and description of the parties; nor would my
confidence in his honesty be diminished even by
finding a defence of forgery set up in two or three
of the cases, though I might begin to think him
less knowing than he thought himself; certainly
not an attorney in England would dream of but-
toning up his pockets, direct side glances at his
cheque-book, or hint to such a client that there
was a police-station at hand.


Mr. Barber had received a fair character of
Fletcher, and precisely of that moderate unpre-
tending kind, that goes farthest with shrewd men
of the world. He received this character from
another client; he began the connection in mat-
ters of the most substantial and respectable de-
scription, in perfect keeping with the character
that had been given, Fletcher showed himself at
once confiding in his instructions and reserved in
his deportment, punctual in his payments, yet
close in his calculations, and most intelligent in
his instructions. Was not this the very beau ideal
of a good client, of a man entitled to full confi-
dence, no less than to all zeal and activity in his
service ? and was not such a client, of all others,
the one most likely to take umbrage at the slightest
intimation of distrust ?
It may, however, be rejoined, that although the
client was above suspicion, and his business legi-
timate in its general nature, yet that casual cir-
cumstances in the progress of it ought to have
awakened doubt, if not distrust; and it is clear,
from the terms of the judgment, that some vague,
indefinite feeling of this kind swayed the mind of
the Court.* Yet, strange to say, so vague and
* We are at length indebted to Lord Campbell for removing,
by his explicit language, all doubt as to the exact meaning of
Mr, Justice Patteson?s judgment. ? If,? says his Lordship, ?an
attorney, suspecting that his client is engaged in a systematic
course of fraud and forgery, continues to act for him, as if he
was assisting to enforce just rights, and to give effect to genuine
documents, he is guilty of gross misconduct, although not
originally privy to the frauds, and although never informed of
the manner in which the forged documents were obtained, and
although, to carry on the imposture, persons may be introduced
to him acting a feigned part.?
This is intelligible enough ; and, indeed, so very obvious, that
no man of common sense will dispute it. It amounts to no more
than this : that when an attorney aids a man whom he believes
to be committing forgery, the attorney is accessary to the


indefinite was the feeling, that in the effort to
express it, or rather to sustain it by circumstance,
the judgment assumed as facts, matters which the
evidence, even in its imperfect form then presented
to them, disproved. This is not said with any
disrespectful purpose or feeling, nor is it meant
to convey the slightest reproach. It is sufficient
to say, that the case was not understood, even as
crime. But the question still remains whether Mr. Barber
? suspected ? that ? his client was engaged in a systematic course
of fraud and forgery.? And in determining this question, it
certainly does become a very important feature in the case, not
only that he ? was never informed of the manner in which the
forged documents were obtained,? hut that persons were intro-
duced to him acting ? a feigned part.? For what possible reason
could such concealment and artifice be resorted to except to
deceive and sustain a delusion? Why should felons act ?a
feigned part? towards an accomplice aiding them m the
accomplishment of the common and felonious purpose ? _
Though Lord Campbell?s judgment has given perspicuity to
Mr. Justice Patteson?s, it has not relieved it from a particle of
the difficulty under which the latter judge apparently laboured.
Let us translate it into other language, and try it by that test.
It may he rendered thus If Mr. Barber knowingly aided
Fletcher in his forgeries, he was an accessary, and properly
convicted ; hut not only the pardon, but the general hearing of
the evidence forbid us to go that length ; we may not charge
him with guilty knowledge?we will adopt the milder term
?suspicion.? He suspected and therefore was guilty
of ? gross misconduct ? in aiding him.
Waiving for a moment the rejoinder that there is no evidence
of suspicion quoted hy their Lordships (and probably for the
sufficient reason that there was none to quote), let us examine
into the justice of this subtle distinction between _ suspicion
and guilty knowledge. Suspicion implies belief: it may be
more or less strong, according to circumstances, but belief, ow-
ever faint, is an essential element in all suspicion ; belief, again,
implies a measure of knowledge, for no man can be said to
believe in the occurrence of a fact, or the existence of a motive,
without some premises being known to him on which he founds
his inference. Thus suspicion resolves itself into knowledge,
though it may be very limited and partial. What, then, is the
standard of graduation in the knowledge of a felonious purpose
whereby we are to adjust the exact point at which our know-
L 2


it was presented; and that it could not he under-
stood in all its merits, because evidence was struck
out which Mr. Barber?s counsel naturally, and
almost necessarily, assumed to be admitted by
consent.
Still the above expression must be vindicated.
? The judgment assumed as facts matters which
the evidence, even in its imperfect form then pre-
ledge becomes guilty in the eye of the law ? We cannot be far
wrong if we say that the criminality of knowledge begins when
assent or assistance to the crime is indicated by some overt act ;
but that, till then, assent must not be presumed, nor knowledge
of facts, innocent in themselves, tortured into guilt.
It is not intended to deny that there were many acts of Mr,
Barber by which the commission of the felony was aided ; but
to call these overt acts?that is, acts by which an intention was
opened or disclosed, when it is admitted that they were all
consistent with an honest purpose?if Mr. Barber was merely a
dupe?is not to prove his guilt by his actions, but to assume that
he was guilty, and to square his actions with that hypothesis.
Thus the theory that he ? suspected ? is founded upon his acts,
though the acts are admitted to be innocent unless he did
suspect. His acts were guilty became he suspected, and he
suspected became he did those acts ! It is thus by a revolving
form of argument that the ordinary process of crimination has
been inverted in Mr. Barber?s case.
A careful review of the whole case will satisfy any candid
reader that it is morally impossible that Mr. Barber ever could
have even suspected. It may seem rather superfluous to com-
ment on the term ?suspicion? in the last judgment, when the
judgment itself asserts, in another place, that the suspicion
amounted to complicity (vide Preface to this edition) ; but
inasmuch as Lord Campbell founds the charge of ? gross miscon-
duct ? on the suspicion supposed to have occupied Mr. Barber?s
mind, and it can scarcely be imagined that complicity in a felony
so serious as forgery, should have been spoken of by the Bench
in the mild terms of ? gross misconduct,? I infer that his Lord-
ship meant that in some cases the suspicion was guilty know-
ledge or felonious, and in other cases only culpable in a moral
and not a legal sense. My observations, therefore, are designed
to show that all culpable suspicion must in effect amount to the
same thing, namely, guilty or felonious privity ; and that if it
falls short ol that, then it falls short of culpability.


sented to them, disproved.? How is this to he
substantiated ?
The first, and the most important of these
errors, is to he found in the following words: ?
? And now the means of forgery having been
obtained through Barber?s application for the
signature,? that is, the signature of Miss Slack,
the real owner of the stock.
Nobody will deny ?it cannot be denied?that if
Fletcher contemplated the acquisition of the stock
by aid of the signature of the real owner, or if the
circumstances of the case implied the necessity of
counterfeiting her signature to obtain the stock,
Mr. Barber?s activity in procuring her signature
was such strong presumptive evidence against
him, that even if a dukedom had been added to
the royal pardon, it would not have reinstated
him in credit. To refuse his readmission to the
profession under the impression that such was the
actual case, was an imperative duty of the Court,
and had it been the case, these pages, at all
events, would never have been written.
But it was not the case; and moreover the very
nature of the fraudulent machinery, and of the
evidence before the Court, proved that it could not
be the case. And more still, that the signature
of Miss Slack not only was not required for a
guilty purpose, or, to use the words of the judg-
ment, ? as a means of forgery,? but could not by
any possibility be required by Mr. Barber, except
as a means of identification, and never was coun-
terfeited throughout the transaction, even by
Fletcher himself: he forged it, -it is true ?not by
imitating her writing, but by studiously avoiding
any resemblance to it ! This will be explained
hereafter.
We will make good every syllable; but, first,


let it be supposed, with the Court, that it was
actually and really required for a guilty purpose,
or as ? a means of forgery.? Does not this of
itself tend to the strongest presumption of Mr.
Barber?s innocence ? The Court describes him as
?an experienced and intelligent London attorney.?
Is it conceivable that any attorney, whether expe-
rienced or intelligent, metropolitan or not, would
openly and undisguisedly apply to Miss Slack?s
relatives and attorney for her signature, with the
intention of counterfeiting it ? Does such suicidal,
self-stultifying folly, come within the compass of
probability, or even of imagination ? Or, were it
possible that Mr. Barber could be thus demented,
is it to be supposed that either Captain Eoskett
or Mr. Baxter (also an experienced and intelligent
London solicitor), would be so foolish and rash as
to entrust her signature to a stranger, unless for
a good and sufficient reason ?
Thus, even conceding it were to be used as
? the means of forgery,? it proves that the con-
templated forgery could be none to which Mr.
Barber was privy.
But it was not wanted as the means of forgery,
but as the means of testing identity. Even
Eletcher himself could (under the very peculiar
circumstances of the case) have wanted it for no
other purpose. The object of obtaining the signa-
ture, was only to ascertain if the stock really
belonged to her or not. Eletcher and Christmas
did ascertain this, but they deceived Mr. Barber.
Eor a reason presently given, we must assume
that it escaped their Lordships, that the evidence
before them proved the forgery in contemplation,
to be that of a willy not of a Bank transfer or
dividend receipt, and consequently, that the signa-
ture to be counterfeited was that of a dead person,
not a living one; that the transfer would be made,


and the dividends received, by a new person,
whose writing was hitherto unknown at the Bank;
by an executrix and legatee, not the stockholder
upon an old account. How was it possible that
Miss Slack?s signature could in any way assist
(except as we shall presently mention) in the
commission of such a fraud ? It could assist, and
it did assist, in identifying the owner; and it
enabled Eletcher to steer his course, not because
it served him in cheating the Bank, but in
deluding Mr. Barber ! If he had never seen Miss
Slack?s signature, Eletcher would equally have
succeeded in his plot, so far as concerned the
Bank; but it was apparent that, unless Mr.
Barber could be checked in his course, he might
stumble on the truth by making the comparison
of handwriting for himself; for he might have
done so, through his own stockbroker, without
any breach of confidence or instructions. Unfor-
tunately, he still thought that his duty and pro-
fessional honour precluded all communications,
except under the sanction of his client ; and
therefore he trusted the examination of the
writing to Eletcher, in preference to his own
stockbroker. Instead of the signature to the will
being an imitation, as the judges appear to have
supposed, of the handwriting of Captain Eoskett?s
sister, it was studiously different from it?a pre-
caution evidently of Eletcher?s, lest Mr. Barber
(who, it will he remembered, had very recently
applied for and obtained her signature) should
have been struck with any resemblance.
But it will he replied that the judicial expres-
sion is correct, because the signature to the will
ought to have tallied with the signature to the
power of attorney, though not with that of the
legatee.
No doubt this is true ; hut it can scarcely have


been the judicial meaning, because the words are
used in censure of Mr. Barber; whereas such a
construction of them lets in a conclusive argu-
ment, amounting to demonstration, of Mr. Barber?s
innocence. It cannot have escaped such an
accomplished knave as Eletcher, that the signa-
tures of the will and of the power ought to have
corresponded, allowing for the difference of twelve
years in age; that there was a risk that compari-
son might be made by the Bank clerks, and thus
lead to detection : he doubtless did see this, and
might even have at first contemplated using Miss
Slack?s signature, the power not being accessible
to him, for the purpose of counterfeiting it in
forging the will. Even if it could have escaped
himself, it must have occurred to such an accom-
plice as an intelligent, experienced attorney; why,
then, was the first idea abandoned, and the pro-
bable vigilance of the Bank set at defiance ? Why
was a forged will prepared, without even an
attempt to counterfeit the true signature ? Why
was a stiff, upright, large hand, substituted for
the fluent elegant writing of the power of attorney,
after a week?s opportunity to imitate it ? Simply
because Mr. Barber was not the accomplice, but
the dupe! Because it was more immediately
dangerous to incur detection by him than by the
Bank clerks; and had Miss Slack?s signature been
counterfeited, as it ought to have been in prudence,
the similarity could not fail to have been promptly
noticed by Mr. Barber the instant that the will
was brought to his office ! The conduct of Eletcher,
in thus hazarding detection at the Bank, in order
to keep up his deceit upon Mr. Barber, is in
perfect harmony with his proceedings throughout,
and proves to demonstration how entirely Mr.
Barber was blindfolded.
Another example of this judicial assumption of


fact, though contradicted by the evidence, is to
be found in the reference which the judgment
makes to ?Hunt?s case ??lt does not appear
that Mr. Barber took any means to satisfy himself
how it happened that Mary Hunt, who did not
appear to have any other property than the stock,
omitted to receive the dividends for thirty-five
years.? But it did appear in the evidence, that
the parties only received, and in fact were only
aware of, twelve years? dividends being in arrear.
How could Mr. Barber inquire into a fact which
he had no reason even to suspect ? Had he been
a guilty man, of course he would have made dili-
gent inquiry to get at all he could lay his hands
on. His omission, therefore, to ask for more than
twelve years? dividends, when he might have asked
for thirty-five, is conclusive evidence of his igno-
rance, and his ignorance is strong presumptive
evidence of his innocence. Yet the judgment
quotes it as affording reason for suspicion.
But there is an error throughout the whole of
this argument, arising from the non-claim of
dividends. We have before adverted to it. Why
should the non-claim of dividends have excited
suspicion at all ? It is clear, upon the evidence,
that there did, in fact, exist a Mary Hunt, who
for thirty-five years omitted to receive her divi-
dends ; it is clear, upon the evidence, that there
did exist a Mrs. Burchard, who for fifteen years
omitted to receive her dividends; it is clear upon the
evidence that there does exist a Miss Slack, who
for twelve years omitted to receive her dividends,
even after executing a power of attorney to receive
them; it is matter of notoriety that an octavo
volume is published, from time to time, containing
the names of thousands who omit to receive their
dividends. The whole case, from first to last, is
based on the acknowledged fact, that many omit


not only to receive their dividends, but also to
claim their principal.
Yet, with this evidence before them, their Lord-
ships assume, in several instances, that the non-
receipt of dividends was a circumstance so unusual
and strange, that this alone should have excited
Mr. Barber?s suspicions of his client. They ought
much more to have excited the suspicions of the
officers of the Bank, hut their inattention to them
is passed over without notice; they were not
before the Court, it is true, but the inferential
argument in Mr. Barber?s favour should not have
been omitted.
Once more: The judgment assumes as fact,
that Mr. Barber falsely represented to Captain
Eoskett, by letter, that there was an entry of the
death of Anne Slack, in October, 1842, at Somerset
House, and then proceeds?? Upon the trial it was
proved that no such entry was, in fact, to he found
there, nor is it now stated by Barber, that from
Eletcher, or from any one, he had at that time re-
ceived information that any such entry was there.?
It was not proved at the trial that Mr. Barber
knew, or had reason to suspect, that such entry
was not at Somerset House; but it was proved,
and in evidence before the Court, that Eletcher
had given such information to Mr. Barber pre-
vious to his correspondence with Captain Eoskett,
and this evidence was substantially confirmed by
the entries in Mr. Barber?s diary, made at the time.
The first instructions were given to Mr. Barber
on the 3rd of October; his first letter was written
on the 4th of October. That letter mentions the
supposed death of the owner of the stock, and that
letter was before the Court.
Enough of these erroneous assumptions op-
posed to the evidence. But there is one broad
and sweeping remark, which, while on the topic


of accidental causes of suspicion, must not be
overlooked. ? Much has been said in general
terms of the affluent circumstances, the respecta-
bility, and imposing demeanour of Fletcher; but
when the facts are looked into, we see nothing in
the length or closeness of their connection; in
the circumstances of Fletcher, as disclosed in his
letter; or in the sort of business which he was
from time to time bringing to Mr. Barber?s office,
to disarm the caution of a scrupulous or sensible
attorney.?
Might it not also have occurred to their Lord-
ships, that the absence of any long or close con-
nection gave high improbability to the theory
that a felonious confidence could exist between
them for more than four years, being almost the
full term of their acquaintance, and' which was
purely professional ?
But what were the facts into which they
looked ? That for four years and more Mr.
Barber, on the favourable report of a client, acted
for Fletcher in differences between him and his
tenants; that he examined titles and prepared
conveyances for him; and that he successfully
established titles in eight cases of unclaimed pro-
perty (for never let it be forgotten, that it is
begging the question to assume that he knew
three out of the eight to be based in forgery?this
is the very fact in issue); and, finally, that he
paid his costs with punctuality. If their Lord-
ships consider that these are not facts to disarm
caution in any attorney, however scrupulous or
acute, it is probable that they will stand almost
alone in their opinion.*
* I did not observe in the former editions the remarkable
fact that, in the judgment of the Coui?t, no notice whatever is
taken of any of the circumstances which are disclosed by the
M 2


And now, it may be legitimately asked, what
peculiarity of circumstance remains in the case to
have awakened suspicion ? It must, in respectful
deference to the Court, he presumed that the
judgment exhausted all. With what degree of
force may he collected from this examination
of it. Can anything more he suggested ? or will
any conscientious solicitor quote a single act in
this professional matter on the part of Mr. Barber,
and say that he would himself have 'acted dif-
ferently ? This question has been asked of many,
but, as yet, has been answered by none, though
many have anxiously observed, ? If such conduct
condemns us, where is our responsibility to end??
It would be uncandid to conceal that many, too,
have averred, that they would not undertake such
evidence in Mr. Barber?s favour, though everything against him
is elaborately stated ; nor should I make the remark now, were
it not that Lord Campbell has upheld the former judgment
without even a superficial review of the evidence, though the
many acknowledgments which I have received, not only from
friends but strangers, of the conviction of innocence which
these pages have produced, prove that to absolve Mr. Barber
from reproach it is only necessary to understand his case. God
forbid that I should draw from this omission any inference to
the derogation of judicial impartiality. I repudiate such an
unworthy idea ; but it is not indecorous to remark that the
very impossibility of thus accounting for the omission, proves
that the evidence, and therefore the, real merits of the case,
have never yet been understood by the Court. Are my argu-
ments sustained by the facts 1 Even the bitterest of Mr.
Barber?s opponents has never disputed my statement of the
facts. Are my arguments forcible and primd facie conclusive ?
It would not become me to quote other evidence that they arc
so considered, than the demand for a third edition upon a sub-
ject of merely personal interest. It would be absurd to suppose
that the same reasoning could possibly have escaped the judicial
mind, had even half the same attention been bestowed on the
case. And in such a case, so peculiar in its character, so novel
in its form, and so important not only to the individual but to
the profession, it would be equally absurd to suppose that had
it occurred to the judicial mind, it would not have been felt


business; but tlie deduction from that avowal
fails, when it is added, that the same persons
have pretty generally owned that they would
not have declined it, had not the case of Mr.
Barber opened their eyes to its danger. Thus it
is not the business that they condemn, hut the
risk of deception with which it is attended, and
which is now, for the first time, made apparent.
No doubt Mr. Barber himself would have
equally shunned it, had such a case ever before
been recorded in our criminal annals. It is easy
enough to appreciate the hazard after it has been
exposed, as the sunken rock becomes visible at
low water; but to suspect such artful and deep
machination, argues not a shrewdness, but a
wickedness of mind only inferior to that of the
man who devised it. A man must be well prac-
necessary to reply to it in detail. Yet it is scarcely going too
far to say that every fact extracted from the evidence in Mr.
Barber?s favour, and every exculpatory inference deduced from
it, is passed over without an attempt to show that the fact
admits of another construction, or that the favourable inference
is rebutted by conflicting circumstances. Two or three com-
paratively trivial points are glanced at and summarily dis-
missed ; but, taken as a whole, the argument of this ? Vindica-
tion,? though patent on the evidence, is untouched by the
Court ; it is a reasonable, not a presumptuous, conclusion that
the Court has never yet made itself master of the evidence. Nor
will this surprise anybody accustomed to the business of the
courts. It has occupied me not hours, nor days, but weeks to
inform myself accurately, by perusal, by close collation, by oral
inquiry, of the bearing of all the voluminous evidence; how is
it possible for any man, however practised or acute, to arrive at
the same knowledge of it by a few hours? attention to forensic
controversy, and a hurried examination of endless and in-
numerable affidavits 1 The curious mistake of Lord Campbell,
noticed in the preface, is a proof of this. A case like this
demands the quiet of the closet to dissect ; but our judges have
little or no repose till they reach the grave. They must often,
perforce, content themselves with a bird?s-eye view of evidence,
when strict justice requires that they should dive to its very
bottom.


tised in the excogitation of villany, to suspect a
system of fraud so new, that it had never been
heard of or conceived till the middle of the nine-
teenth century.
It may be urged, without presumption, that
twenty-five years of personal experience in an
attorney?s practice, afford a better foundation for
a sound judgment on such points than fifty of
forensic and judicial success. It is not, then, out
of place to quote a case from that experience in
an office where more titles of a particular class
were examined from year to year than probably
in any two of the largest offices in London.
A reversionary interest in a third of ï¿½IO,OOO
was sold by auction by Mr. Alderman Earebrother,
and it was purchased by a public society. The title
was derived through a settlement executed on the
marriage of the vendor, whose wife, while still
unmarried, was the legatee under a will. The
abstract of such a title, of course, consisted of the
will, the settlement, and affidavits : and the cer-
tificates were of the usual character. This ab-
stract was delivered, examined with an attested
copy of the settlement, and, subject to the usual
comments and suggestions for inquiry, the title
was approved by that eminent conveyancer, now
Master Humphrey.
In the exercise of due caution, the abstract was
forwarded to the most experienced firm in Dublin
?Messrs. Dunn and Meade, the solicitors to the
Bank of Ireland?to be examined with the original
settlement. The vendor was himself an Irish
solicitor, and employed as his agent in London an
attorney of some repute. Messrs. Dunn and
Meade were not only most cautious and ex-
perienced men, but stood at the head of their
profession; and they were not less distinguished
by their acuteness, than by their high professional


grdde. They examined the abstract with the
original settlement, found it accurate, and re-
turned it to the solicitor of the purchasers. It
was proposed to hand over the attested copy of
the settlement with the intended conveyance of
the reversion. While the conveyance was in pre-
paration, and being settled by counsel, the pur-
chasers? solicitor again examined the abstract
with the attested copy, and, finding some clerical
inaccuracies in the latter not noticed in the
attestation, he determined to send the attested
copy also to Ireland, to be re-examined with the
original. Messrs. Dunn and Meade called for the
reproduction of the original; but so much reluct-
ance was exhibited, professedly on account of
trouble and expense, that months intervened,
with no other result than angry and endless
correspondence. Meanwhile the conveyance was
settled and engrossed, and ready for execution by
the first of September. On that day the vendor
and his London agent called at the office of
the purchasers? solicitor, and affecting to he
greatly injured, and of course very indignant at
the delay, insisted on the immediate completion
of the purchase. The purchasers? solicitor was
absent from London at the time, but his managing
clerk, well knowing the captious and illiberal
disposition of his clients, to whom the vendor
threatened to complain, unguardedly allowed the
conveyance to he delivered as an escrow, deferring
the payment of the purchase-money till the return
of the attested copy from Dublin. Of course the
deed,, conditionally executed, -remained in the
vendor?s possession. He went with it to Dare-
brother, and on some frivolous pretence, that the
payment of the purchase-money was only delayed
by some formality of getting the cheque counter-
signed, induced the auctioneer to pay him the


whole purchase-money, exceeding a thousand
pounds. The auctioneer now became clamorous
for repayment by the purchasers, hut their soli-
citor remained firm. The auctioneer threatened,
complained, and remonstrated for successive
months; and, strange to say, the clients joined
him in the outcry, and severely censured their
own solicitor for a caution which they were
pleased to call dilatory. He remained inflexible;
and then the auctioneer was ill-advised, and com-
menced an action at law against the purchasers.
Nothing daunted, their solicitor rejoined by re-
pudiating the contract, and bringing a cross
action against the auctioneer for the deposit.
Special juries were struck in both actions, and
two years elapsed before they were appointed for
trial?the auctioneer?s being the first set down.
In the interim, the attested copy was sent back
from Dublin, unexamined, the original marriage
settlement not being forthcoming, and the trus-
tees, as well as the attesting witnesses of the
copy, being alike inaccessible.
Three days before the trial, the solicitor of the
purchasers received an anonymous letter, threaten-
ing him not only with an indictment for perjury,
but with injury to character yet more serious, if
he ventured to enter the witness-box, to prove
that he was not present, and not an assenting
party to the unconditional execution of the con-
veyance, the writer adding that they were pre-
pared to prove the contrary !!! As two years
had intervened, and the transaction, as ill luck
would have it, had occurred when the managing
clerk happened to be alone in the office, this was
a perilous threat. He appointed an immediate
consultation, but counsel were unanimous that
the danger must be boldly faced. He returned to
his office much depressed, and in a state of mind


by no means to be envied, but resolved to do his
duty. The transaction having occurred on the Ist
of September, he well knew that he could not
have been in town, as for many years he had
been a devotee to sporting; but, how could he
corroborate his evidence of absence on that
specific day, except by his clerk ? Tor the
twentieth time every letter and paper in the office
about that date was turned over and examined to
obtain some collateral proof, and thus time wore
away till late in the evening before the trial.
While pondering over the prospect before him,
he casually took up a pill-box on his clerk?s desk,
and unconsciously unfolded the paper in which it
was wrapped to see what it contained. This
envelope was the cover of a letter to his clerk in
his own handwriting, bearing the postmark of a
distant provincial town, and dated the very same
day as that upon which the suborned perjury was
to prove him to have been in London !
Thus fortified, he entered the witness-box with
confidence, and left the court successful. The
auctioneer lost his money, plus the deposit and
the costs of both actions. It is probable that
ï¿½2,500 did not cover his total loss. Within two
months following the trial, it was discovered that
the marriage settlement had been forged to meet
the usual objection that the reversion belonged to
a feme coverte; the attested copy was forged;
the trustees of the marriage settlement and the
attesting witnesses both to that deed and to the
attested copy, were all personated and counter-
feit ; and thus, in one and the same transaction,
not less than four experienced and scrupulous
London attorneys (for, including the auctioneer?s
attorney, there were four engaged in it), one
experienced and most astute Dublin attorney,
and one eminent and generally able auctioneer,


were all deceived and cheated by a plot so simple,
and yet so ingenious, that a child may understand
it on perusal, though neither the bench nor any
of the eminent counsel retained in the cause, had
the slightest suspicion of any possible defect in
the title, beyond the nonproduction a second
time of the original settlement. The purchasers?
solicitor was the writer of this pamphlet, and
there are many yet living to whom this legal
romance is as well known as to himself.
Compare this case with Mr. Barber?s, and who
will venture to say, that that gentleman, as an
experienced London attorney, was blameable for
not entertaining suspicions of his client ?
But, on the other hand, are there not many
circumstances in the case, as here stated from the
evidence, to lull suspicion ?
The reputed character and easy circumstances
of Fletcher have been already mentioned; and
let it be remembered that suspicion, if excited
at all, must necessarily have been suspicion of no
trifling and no single crime. It must have been
suspicion of long and systematic forgery, or of
nothing. We have only one case on record, in
modem times, of any gentleman having been
convicted of systematic forgery. It is the case of
Fauntleroy. But there was this remarkable dif-
ference between the two cases: Fauntleroy proved
to be a man in most embarrassed circumstances ;
Fletcher was known to Mr. Barber to be a man
in most prosperous circumstances. We have
no graduated scale, certainly, by which we can
exactly measure the varying form of temptation
according to wealth; nor do they even always
maintain an inverse proportion ; but as a rule of
life, the maxim is trite, that crime is infrequent
as means abound. The probabilities in this


case were largely in favour of Fletcher?s inte-
grity.
Another incident to lull suspicion, was constant
success in previous cases. In some of them, it
was obviously within Mr. Barber?s personal know-
ledge, that legitimate and rightful owners had
been found by Fletcher?s exertions. Why should
he have doubted in any of them ? What distinc-
tion obtained between those which were genuine
claims, and those which were dishonest ? They
were all cast in the same mould; they all bore
the same marked and prominent features. In-
deed, little as Fletcher?s letter seems to have
been regarded by their Lordships, it is conceded,
even by Mr. Barber?s opponents, that it is conclu-
sive of his innocence up to the date of it, the 20th
July, 1842, unless it can be impeached as a pre-
concerted artifice. It has been shown that this
theory is absurd, utterly irreconcileable with the
other circumstances in evidence. Then that letter
establishes the fact, that in no less than eight
previous cases, all occurring before the 20th July,
1842, Mr. Barber was naturally lying under the
impression that Fletcher?s researches had been
followed by invariable success. Was not this an
incident to lull suspicion ? Again, in every case
these titles had been investigated and had passed
muster at the Bank, where it was the special and
peculiar duty of its officers to examine into claims
for stock and dividends transferred to the Com-
missioners, with severe vigilance. Was not this,
too, well calculated to lull suspicion ?
Once more, when doubt as to identity was
created in Mr. Barber?s mind by the apparently
singular coincidence of there being two Anne
Slacks of Smith-street, Chelsea, both fundholders,
were not the misstatement of age, the alleged
N 2


difference in handwriting, and the strange, and
still unexplained forgetfulness of Miss Slack after
actually executing a power of attorney to receive
the dividends, calculated to lull suspicion ?
And lastly, was not the number of accomplices
essential to carry out the plan of fictitious per-
sonation, so great, and the danger of detection
consequently so imminent, as almost to preclude
the possibility of suspecting, even under more
equivocal appearances, that a client like Fletcher
was the captain of a band of organised swindlers ?
Yet to none of these facts does the judgment
attach the slightest importance!
We may now proceed with the narrative of the
second scene in this drama, beginning with the
discovery of the fraud.


PART 11.
After the lapse of ten years from the last
receipt of dividends upon stock, the Bank, pur-
suant to an Act of Parliament, transfers nil
unclaimed dividends, and the stock itself, to the
Commissioners for the Reduction of the National
Debt. The ï¿½3,500, standing in the name of
Anne Slack, of Smith-street, Chelsea, had been
so transferred. When the transfer was made to
the pretended executrix, the account was marked
as a ? dead ? account; but on the deposit of the
probate of the forged will, either by some mis-
take, or by some peculiarity of Bank practice, the
other account of ï¿½6,000, in Miss Slack?s name,
though in a different stock, and though not
claimed by the pretended executrix, was also
marked ? dead ? in the Bank books. How this
occurred has never been explained. It could not
have been occasioned by the registration of the
probate, as not only the larger sum had not been
claimed, much less transferred under it to the
executrix, but it could not have been claimed by
her without attention being called to the insuffi-
ciency of the probate duty. Pletchcr soon became
aware, through Mr. Christmas, of the error made
hy the Bank clerk, and he informed Mr. Barber,
and also Mr. Bircham, of it on the 3rd of April,
being four days prior to the receipt of the money
% the pretended Emma Slack . It was not till
the 7th of April that she made the transfer, yet,
on the 3rd, we find the following entries in the


diaries of Mr. Barber and Mr. Bircbam. Mr.
Barber?s is merely?
? Ap. 3. Slack ? Mr. Fletcher?they had made both Miss
Slacks dead''
Mr. Bircham?s entry is more extended?
? Ap. 3. Slack, Miss?Long attendance on Mr. Fletcher, on
the subject of some confusion which had been created by the
Bank, relative to yowr stock, and that of a lady of the same
norm and address as your late aunt''
This is a most important feature in the case;
for had it been clearly understood in its full
import, either by the Court or by the jury, it
could not have failed to have led to a verdict
favourable to Mr. Barber, even without his
calling evidence; for the fact was apparent on
the evidence for the prosecution, and had it been
understood by the directors of the Bank, they
would not have directed the prosecution of Mr.
Barber, it not being their practice to prosecute,
unless in cases which they are advised to be free
from reasonable doubt.
And here we may observe, in passing, that the
prosecution has been declared to have been at the
instance of the Lords of the Treasury; but as it
was conducted by the Bank solicitor, and must
have been undertaken on the Bank report of the
facts, we seem justified in treating it as a Bank
prosecution.
It was obvious to common sense, that this
error must inevitably lead to detection, and that,
too, very speedily; for Miss Slack?s dividends
would fall due in October, and these dividends
she claimed regularly. When, therefore, she
appeared to receive them, she would find that her
account was closed as a ? dead ? account; and, in
point of fact, it was in this way that the fraud
was detected. Mr. Barber and Mr. Bircham botli


knew of the error four days before the fraud teas
completed , and ivhile there was yet tvme to prevent
its consummation. They must have also known,
as any schoolboy would have foreseen, that such
an error insured the detection of the forgery;
that escape was positively hopeless, and yet, with
all this hazard and certainty of detection staring
him in the face, and when there was ample time
to arrest the crime, and even at the eleventh
hour, by pleading mistake however tardily dis-
covered, to propitiate if not mislead the Bank, it
is to be presumed that he rushed headlong into
destruction!!! Not all the influence of the
Bank, nor all the power of advocacy, could have
forced a verdict of guilty, had this been rightly
understood by a jury. It did not merely open
the door to a doubt; it amounted to moral
demonstration that Mr. Barber had no concep-
tion that he was dealing in felony, that his con-
duct was honestly and bond fide professional, and
professional alone. But it may be answered, that
Fletcher knew it as well, and yet he proceeded.
Very true; but Fletcher also knew that it was
more dangerous for him to recede than to ad-
vance, because if Mr, Barber had discovered for-
gery in Slack?s case, he would begin to suspect
that he had been made the catspaw in others, and
would instantly disclose every thing to the Bank.
But this is not the only inference in Mr. Bar-
ber?s favour, to which this singular fact admits
us. It is unnoticed in the judgment; we must
presume, in common charity, that it passed un-
noticed by the prosecutors and their counsel; it
equally escaped the attention of Mr. Barber?s
counsel, as we have learnt from Serjeant Wilkins;
but so it is, that while Mr. Barber is condemned,
and severely punished too, for not being as ? wide
awake ? as an experienced and intelligent London


attorney ought to be, a fact patent on the evidence
for the Crown, and in the highest degree favour-
able to the accused, escapes the attention of the
judge who tried him; of the solicitors for the
Bank, who conducted the prosecution ; of the
counsel for the prosecution; of the counsel of
the Incorporated Law Society, who opposed his
readmission; of the counsel who supported that
opposition; and lastly, of the Court in Banco
who adjudicated upon it ! Is Mr. Barber the
only party that does not show himself wide
awake ? or must we resort to the old apology,
? Aliquando dormitat Homerus ? ? If the answer
is, that the point is not material, we are willing
to join issue upon that, and go to the country.
If twelve men of plain understanding can be
found in all England, who will believe that ? an
experienced and intelligent London attorney ?
would go to the Bank of England to utter a
forged will, four days after he had received notice
that within six months that forgery must inevi-
tably he detected by an error already committed
in the Bank books, let trial by jury he abolished
as a nuisance, and guilt he decided by a throw of
the dice. We say nothing here of the absence of
all advantage or motive; we say nothing of other
absurdities which the theory of guilt in this case
involves. Some have been exposed already, and
more will he exposed hereafter. We are content
to abide by this issue, waiving all other defence;
and on this issue we challenge the opinion of
every man in the country, lawyer or layman.*
* Notwithstanding the apology which I have suggested in a
previous note, and suggested with perfect sincerity, for the
omission of all notice of passages in the evidence favourable to
Mr. Barber, in the necessarily superficial review of it taken by
the judges, it is difficult to conceive how this most important fact
should have escaped Lord Campbell?s attention, if he read the


To proceed. Mr. Barber, who, if guilty, knew
that the sword was suspended over him by a thread,
quietly remained at his office transacting his usual
business, and following his ordinary routine of
life for seven months without concealment or pre-
paration for flight. On the 15th of November
Mr. James Preshfield, the solicitor to the Bank,
called upon him to inquire into the circumstances
of Slack?s case. He was received with courtesy and
frankness. Mr. Barber immediately supposed
that his object was to rectify the error in the
Bank books, and told him so, and at once pro-
duced to him all the papers, and communicated
to him every particular in his power. Mr. Eresh-
field corrected this impression of his object, and
intimated that Miss Slack, of Abbots Langley,
was the party really entitled to the stock. On
whole of the affidavits. I acknowledge my utter inability to
guess at a plausible explanation. The publication of this
pamphlet has brought me into communication with many per-
sons on the subject. Several whom I have never seen, and
some whose names were previously unknown to me, have ad-
dressed me letters and criticisms upon it. Hence I have ascer-
tained, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the extraordinary
circumstance mentioned in the text has been deemed conclusive
of Mr. Barber?s innocence, even without the aid of the cumu-
lative proofs. Yet it was unnoticed by Lord Campbell, though
he avowedly placed the question, and very rightly too, on the
broad basis of guilt or innocence. It may be said that a judge
is under no obligation to state all, or perhaps any of the grounds
of an adverse judgment. In such a case, however, the practice
is otherwise ; at all events Lord Campbell estopped himself from
denying the obligation because he did explain himself, and did
vindicate his judgment, as he conceived, by avowing the reasons
on which it was founded. How then did it happen that, while
he fairly put the case on the basis of guilt or innocence, he
omitted to notice a circumstance which is universally acknow-
ledged to be conclusive of innocence, and absolutely incom-
patible with guilt 1 If his Lordship thought otherwise, surely
in assigning his reasons it was desirable not to overlook a point
of such importance, and to explain why it failed to impress the
Court as it has impressed all others.


hearing this Mr. Barber exclaimed, That implies
forgery.? To this Mr. Breshfield assented, and
demanded, in an imperious tone, the name of the
client who had introduced the business, which
Mr. Barber declined to give; partly, no doubt,
because he was irritated by the tone of the
demand, but principally because he felt that by
giving it he might betray his client?s confidence,
and involve him in serious trouble and annoyance,
on no better authority than the suspicions which
Mr. Breshfield had expressed. Mr. Preshfield
persisted in demanding the name, accompanying
his demand with threats of some awful proceed-
ings at the instance of the Bank or the Treasury.
If there was one course more certain than another
of confirming an honourable and innocent man in
his first refusal, it was to proceed by menace.
Mr. Barber did not ring his bell, but he did per-
sist in his refusal, till he had obtained his client?s
permission, for which he promised to apply if
Mr. Ereshficld would again communicate with
him in a day or two. The oral evidence of Mr.
Breshfield himself substantially confirms this
statement.* Mr. Breshfield departed, and Mr.
* When I first published this pamphlet, I felt bound to con-
fine myself to the evidence before the world, and hence I could
not avail myself of any explanations from Mr. Bai'ber. But I
have had much communication with him since, and this enables
me to state with more accuracy what actually occurred on this
occasion. It appears that the objection to disclose Fletcher?s
name, on the ground of professional honour, was not provoked
in the first instance ; on the contrary, Mr. Barber proposed to
Mr. Freshfield that he should examine his books, and especially
his diary and letter-books, and placed them all before him. In
these books the name of Fletcher was prominent, as the extracts
given at pp. 5 4 and 55 will shew. The idea of ? studiously con-
cealing ? his name, when the books or any of the clerks in Mr.
Barber?s office, engaged in the transaction, could have disclosed
it, was preposterous ; but, instead of examining the books laid
before him, Mr. Freshfield demanded the name in an offensive


Barber, without any delay, wrote Fletcher the
following letter: ?
? 15th November, 1843, Wednesday.
? Dear Sir, ?I have received a communication from the
Bank, in reference to which I shall be glad to see you. To-
morrow I have a cause to try, but on Saturday, if you will call,
I shall be at the office. ? Yours faithfully,
? ?J. Fletcher, Esq.? ?W. H. Barber.?
Fletcher called on Friday ,* and on hearing
what had passed, observed, ?You ought not to
be surprised at this, after my having apprised
you of the mistake which had been made in the
Bank books ; the inquiry is precisely what I
expected, but the error will be put right, and you
will hear no more of it.? Mr. Barber proposed
to call on Mr. Freshfield, to ascertain if the error
had been corrected, but Fletcher dissuaded him,
lest it should afford Mr. Freshfield another
opportunity of probing him to learn from whom
he had originally obtained the information about
the stock. Mr. Freshfield never repeated his
visit, but, twenty-four days afterwards, caused
Mr. Barber to be apprehended on his way to his
office, shortly after nine o?clock in the morning,
having, during all this interval, kept a police
officer in hourly watch on his movements.
It is in evidence that Mr. James Freshfield
avowed to the solicitor of Mr. Barber, that he
would not have been prosecuted but for this
refusal to disclose the name of Fletcher. It is,
tone. This made Mr. Barber ? shut up,? if I may be pardoned
the phrase, and the pause that ensued gave him time to reflect
on the propriety of the disclosure. With this explanation the
narrative of the scene, as given in the text, is perfectly correct.
* Not on Saturday, as Mr. Barber had proposed. This, in
all probability, arose partly from anxiety for speedy information,
and partly from an apprehension that Mr. Barber might have
suspected his villany, and have prepared a hostile reception for
him on the Saturday.
o 2


perhaps, fortunate in one respect for Mr. Barber
that he was prosecuted, for it may be doubted
whether he would otherwise ever have obtained
even this qualified admission of his innocence.
But the principle here involved must not he so
easily passed over. We intend no personal dis-
respect to Mr. James Ereshfield, and he knows it.
We believe him to be a man of right feeling and
honourable mind; and personal knowledge of
him from his childhood entitles him to this testi-
mony to his worth. But what is there in the
position of Mr. James Ereshfield that gives him
any pretence to assume the office of inquisitor into
the professional relation between other solicitors
and their clients ? No man knows better the
sacred confidence of that relation; what would
he have thought had Mr. Barber retorted the
inquiry upon himself: ?By whose desire do you
interrogate me?? ?I am the solicitor to the
Bank.? ?Well, and what of that? I care as
little for the Bank of England as for the Emperor
of Japan; I want the names of individuals, not of
a corporate client.? Had this answer been given,
though the courtesy of it might have been equi-
vocal, the justice of it could not hate been chal-
lenged. -Yet it may well he doubted if Mr.
Ereshfield would have felt it consistent with his
professional honour to give the names of those
gentlemen who assembled in the Bank parlour
when the prosecution was ordered.
It may be very natural for Mr. James Eresh-
field to think otherwise, but he may he assured
that, though everybody is well disposed to render
him all due respect as an eminent solicitor, there
is not one of his professional brethren who will
concede to him, in that capacity, an iota of privi-
lege or authority beyond what may be legally
exacted by the humblest member of the body in


the discharge of his duty. It was fully competent
to Mr. James Preshfield to put the question,
?Who is your client ?? but he was not entitled
to resent, much less to put an adverse construc-
tion on the refusal to answer it, till the client?s
permission had been obtained. ?Is forgery, then,
to be covered by the privilege of the professional
relation?? Certainly not; but the professional
relation is not to be made subservient to inquisi-
tion into the conduct and character of a client,
till magisterial or judicial authority has interposed
for the protection of the public, and thereby de-
termined the professional privilege.* We have
heard the question mooted in many legal circles,
and with more freedom, perhaps, than decorum
would permit in Mr. James Ereshfield?s pre-
sence. We will not deny that in some instances,
though very few, an opposite opinion has found
very respectable adherents; but we may truly
say that the feeling is universal, that Mr.
Barber?s prosecution on no stronger presumption
* The privilege of confidence is the privilege of the public,
and not of the attorney; and the rule, therefore, is, that in
criminal proceedings, where the safety of the public requires it,
the privilege is determined. Yet, to show how strictly the
Courts protect the privilege on principle, I may be allowed to
quote some authorities.
In the Duchess of Kingston?s case, 20 How. St. Tr. 612, it is
laid down that ?an attorney in a criminal case is bound by the
same rules as to confidential communication as in civil proceed-
ings ; he cannot be compelled, and ought not, to disclose any-
thing in evidence against his client, either before the grand jury
or the Court, which has been communicated to him in the
course of his employment as the professional adviser of the
party, either in that or any other judicial investigation.?
Of course I do not offer this authority as a sanction for any
confidence in criminal cases, except such as is reposed by a
Party accused, in an attorney who is aiding him in his defence.
Again, in Cholmondeley v. Clinton, 19 Yes. 267, Lord Eldon
takes it to be clear that no Court would permit an attorney


of guilty knowledge was unwarrantable. The dis-
tinction is precisely this, that had Mr. James
Treshfield been a magistrate he was entitled to
put an unfavourable construction on a refusal to
answer the question; but that in the character
which he considered it to be his duty to assume
for the occasion, the question might be allowed,
but the refusal to reply was perfectly justifiable,
whether protected by professional privilege or
not.
Yet this reply, by Mr. James Treshfield?s own
admission, consigned an innocent man?his equal
in station and profession?to transportation, igno-
miny, and chains; and, but a few years pre-
viously, would as certainly have murdered him
by judicial process.
On being apprehended, Mr. Barber was con-
veyed at once to the Mansion-house, where he
was searched, and his pocket-book and other
papers, with the keys of his office-desk and
drawers, taken from him. He wrote notes to his
partner and clerk, which he delivered to the
to give evidence of his client?s secrets, or would have any diffi-
culty if he did so in striking him off the Roll.?
In Goodlight v. Bridge, Lofffc, 27, Mr. Justice Buller makes
some very strong observations on the subject, and speaking of
the perpetuity of the obligation imposed by the professional
relation, says, ?it is not sufficient to say that the cause is at
an end : the mouth of such a person is shut for ever.?
That Mr. Barber was wholly free from any suspicion of his
client, is proved by the readiness with which, in the first
instance, he laid open all his books and papers to Mr. Freshfield?s
eye; but when that gentleman assumed the tone of criminal
jurisdiction, and, by this misplaced assumption, excited Mr.
Barber?s anger and awakened reflection, it was natural for him
to recall to mind the general principle, and to ask himself
whether he had not already trenched upon it. Mr. Freshfield,
in pique at this rebellion against his fancied authority, turned
his suspicions against Mr. Barber himself, and in this pique, as
is virtually confessed by his admission to Mr. Barber?s solicitor,
all this extraordinary prosecution originated !


officer; he was kept a close prisoner till one
o?clock, and then again earnestly requested to be
allowed to send for his partner or for counsel, hut
was refused permission ! About half-past one his
partner and clerk arrived, the notes addressed to
them having been kept back till the office had
been thoroughly ransacked.
When Mr. Bircham found on what charge his
partner had been taken, he naturally observed,
?If you are guilty, I am guilty; hut of course
you will soon he discharged: Eletcher will at
once explain it.? And under this impression, and
at Mr. Barber?s request, he proceeded to Eletcher?s
house at Camberwell to bring him forward.
During his absence, Mr. Barber was brought be-
fore the Lord Mayor, and found Mr, Clarkson
present, instructed against him, accompanied by
Mr. Ereshfield and his witnesses. Mr. Clarkson
suggested a remand till Thursday, hut bail being
refused, Mr. Barber preferred an immediate exa-
mination. While it was proceeding, Mr. Bircham
arrived with Eletcher. After being allowed to
confer with his partner, Mr. Barber determined on
calling Eletcher, and, beckoning to him, told him
that he must really explain the matter. Eletcher
objected ?that he should be pressed to divulge
the name of his informant at the Bank.? Mr.
Barber answered, that he conceived he was not
bound to do that, and Eletcher claimed his pro-
tection if the question was pressed. Eletcher then
said, ? Had I not better account for my connexion
with the executrix by meeting her at the Bank ??
By no means,? replied Mr. Barber; ?on the
contrary, state the precise truth in every parti-
cular.? Eletcher still hesitated, when Mr. Barber,
with some warmth, addressed him?? Even if you
should be pressed to reveal the name of your
Bank friend, I can?t help it. You know how you


accounted to me for meeting with Emma Slack,
and I have no alternative but calling you. My
detention in custody, even for twenty-four hours,
would do me irreparable mischief; refuse, if you
please, to disclose your friend?s name, hut for
God?s sake don?t build up a particle of fiction.?
Mr. Bircham, who was present all the time,
urged him in similar terms, and without waiting
for his answer, Mr. Barber called him as a
witness.
It is unnecessary to pursue in further detail this
part of the case. Everybody knows that from that
hour Mr. Barber remained a prisoner; was tried
on two cases?Stewart?s and Slack?s ; ?acquitted
on the former, and convicted on the latter. But
there are some incidents not yet known to many.
Mr. Bircham, though not in court, was at hand,
and had been subpoenaed by the prosecutor. Mr.
Freshfield knew where he was to he found; Mr,
Farher and his friends did not. All this has
since come out by the publication in the Times of
extracts from letters of Mr. Bircham himself.
Yet the counsel for the Bank would not call him !
Was their object ? conviction at all hazards ??
The character of those gentlemen necessarily
forbids such a conclusion. They must have acted
on their instructions. Then what were those
instructions ? It cannot be that the importance
of Mr. Bircham?s evidence was doubted; that not
only would argue an ignorance of the whole case
which is inconceivable, hut is contradicted by
the emphasis with which the counsel for the Bank
dwelt on the conference with Eletcher at the
Mansion House, just mentioned. They knew
that Bircham was privy to that conference, for it
passed before their eyes: but, above all, they
knew (it could not be otherwise) that Bircham?s
evidence must, of absolute necessity , he conclusive


either of innocence or guilt. Then why not call
him ? Bircham could have told the jury that he
was not only privy, hut a party to Mr. Barber?s
proceedings throughout. Bircham could have
stated how the business came to them; what had
been their connection with Fletcher; what profit
had been derived from it; what steps had been
taken to discover Anne Slack ; what private con-
ference he had about it with his partner. Every-
thing was known to him; and he was a competent
witness, if Barber was really guilty. This full
development must have established his guilt, if
guilty, beyond all question; and if he was really
innocent, it would have honourably acquitted
him. Then why did Mr. Ereshfield acquiesce?
we use the mildest term?why did he acquiesce
in the determination not to call Bircham ? We
are too practised in such matters, as he well
knows, not to understand the policy of keeping
back doubtful witnesses. But that dexterity of
management affords no answer here. The guilt
of Mr. Barber was, even by Mr. Ereshfield?s own
acknowledgment to his attorney, so very doubtful,
that, but for his refusal to answer a particular
question, he would not have been indicted. And
Mr. Bircham was no doubtful witness; for, had
not his innocence been sifted and acknowledged,
he would have been placed with his partner in the
dock. Then why was he not produced and
called ?
Much allowance may be made for Bircham?s
position. He truly said, that if Mr. Barber was
guilty, so was he ; and certainly it would require
as much courage and resolution to challenge the
hostility of the Bank in such a matter, as of the
Holy Inquisition. It is no subject of surprise
that he hung back, when he well knew that his
partner was put on trial for nothing but the dis-


charge of plain professional duty. It was a cruel
dilemma. A word from him could have estab-
lished his partner?s innocence. The absence of
that word atforded negative though formidable
presumption of his partner?s guilt; and doubtless
weighed heavily with the jury. But there sat the
terrible array of Bank inquisitors; one act of
indiscretion, one touch of professional sympathy,
might at once consign himself also to their tender
mercies, and he was prudent! he was absent!
In the Times of the 17th May, 1850, will be
found certain extracts from Mr. Bircham?s letters
that explain the whole. The unqualified pity
that we feel for him after that exposure, restrains
us from a republication of these extracts.*
Never, however, let it be forgotten, that the
prosecutors had subpoenaed him, that the prose-
cutors knew where to find him, and knew the
value of his evidence; and not only did not call
him, but insisted on his absence, as affording the
strongest presumption of his partner?s guilt! 11*
* When the last edition was published I was not aware that
a letter from Messrs. J. C. and H. Freshfield had been pub-
lished as an advertisement in the Times of the 20th of May,
1850, in reply to Mr. Barber?s letter of the 17th of the same
month. Having read that letter, I feel bound in justice to
Messrs. Freshfield to republish it here, as well as Mr. Barber?s ;
and am therefore obliged to republish the extracts mentioned
in the text. They are as follows :

that must not be overlooked.

I feel imperatively called upon to prove that the assertion of my
counsel is strictly true.
? Mr. Bircham says he ? now learns for the first time that he
was not to be found.? At page 58 of my pamphlet is the fol-
lowing statement :??His evidence, however, did not answer
their (the prosecutors?) purpose, for they not only kept him out
of the witness-box, but acting under their instructions, as I have
every reason to believe, he kept entirely out of reach until the
trial was over.?
?Immediately upon the publication of my pamphlet (in
February, 1849) I sent Mr. Bircham a copy of it, for the ex-
press purpose of affording him the earliest opportunity of con-
tradicting, if he could, any reflection upon himself; but he never
ventured on any such contradiction.
?A short time previously to the session of the Central
Criminal Court for March, 1844, my counsel, Mr. Parry, was
under the necessity of applying to the Lord Mayor to postpone
the trial, expressly upon the ground that Mr. Bircham could
not be subpoenaed. The following is an extract from the affidavit
of my solicitor which induced the Lord Mayor, by the consent
of the prosecution, to comply with Mr. Parry?s application ;
? That in the opinion of this deponent, the said Merrick Bircham
Bircham is a necessary and material witness on behalf of the
said William Henry Barber, and that the said William Henry
Barber could not have a fair trial without the evidence of the
said Merrick Bircham Bircham. That he, this deponent, has
personally made diligent enquiry for the said Merrick Bircham
Bircham during several weeks past, in order to serve him with
a subpoena to attend at the next sitting of the Central Criminal
Court. That for this purpose he has enquired for him at his
late offices, 28, Hew Bridge-street; at his lodgings, 2, Devon-
shire-street, Queen-square; at his solicitors, Messrs. Langley
and Gibbon, 27, John-street, Bedford-row; and at various other
places during the last three weeks; but that notwithstanding
Ms utmost exertions he has been unable to serve the said Mer-
rick Bircham Bircham with a subpoena.?

come forward and state what he knew to my solicitor, and to
receive a subpoena. In one of them, dated the 28th of Decern-

received both these letters ; but he never answered either. In
writing to a friend, 18th of February, 1844, he says, ?I don?t at

he will be cautious of giving it to every one who asks for it.?
And to the same friend he writes, on the following day, ? I have
given my address ; he?s a good fellow, and won?t tell
other people of my whereabouts.? On the 3rd of March, shortly
after the trial was postponed, he writes to another friend,
? C mentioned that Barber was most particularly anxious
when he saw him to know where I was to be found, but he
(0 ) of course was dark.? And on the 17th of the same
month he writes to the same person, ? You need not let Barber's
attorney know I mean to he in town. I shall not let any one
know it. lam going to stay with a friend at Islington, and
shall keep out of the way.' These several letters were written
from Newmarket and other parts of the country, where the
writer was enjoying, apparently with unabated zest, the sports
of the field. Mr. Bircham says, he was in the ? neighbour-
hood ? at the time of my trial under a subpoena from my prose-
cutors. Yes, I doubt not he was in the neighbourhood ready
to serve the purpose of the prosecutors, but they dared not call
him. They well knew what would be the effect of his cross-
examination, which was my only chance of getting his evidence,
for he took care not to let my solicitor know where he was
concealed.

incidentally made by Mr. Serjeant Wilkins has not been
abundantly justified. Of the importance of Mr. Bircham?s


Mr. Christmas had, in breach of official duty,

Mr. Christmas had actually compared the signa-
ture of Miss Slack with the power of attorney,

12th or 13th of December, 1843, is the best proof, for he therein
says, ? To my certain knowledge there never was a more cruel or
unfounded charge ever 'preferred. I have been now connected
with Mr. Barber two years, and a more upright or honourable
partner could not exist,?

?9, Howard-street, Strand, May 14, 1850.?
No answer to the above has ever been published by Mr.
Bircham.
?To the Editor of the Times.
?Sir,? Our attention has been called to a letter of Mr,
Barber in your paper, containing the following paragraph :
? ? His (Mr. Bircham?s) evidence, however, did not answer their
(the prosecutors?) purpose, for they not only kept him out of the
witness-box, but acting under their instructions, as I have every
reason to believe, he kept entirely out of reach until the trial
was over.?
?To this statement, so far as it relates to the prosecutors, and
ourselves as their solicitors, we beg to give the most unqualified
contradiction.
? Shortly after Mr. Barber?s apprehension, Mr. Bircham placed
himself in the hands of a solicitor, through whom we communi-
cated with him.
?We understood that Mr. Bircham was under apprehension
of legal proceedings on the part of creditors of Barber and
Bircham, and if he was not generally accessible, tills arose from
no interference on our part.
? In the exercise of their discretion, the counsel for the pro-
secutors did not call Mr. Bircham as a witness, but we had served
him with a subpoena to secure his attendance, and he attended
in consequence, and would have been in court if Mr. Barber?s
counsel had not required all the witnesses to be excluded during
the proceedings.
?If it is asked why we now, for the first time, contradict a
statement published by Mr. Barber in a pamphlet upwards of a
year ago, we reply that we were employed by the Government to


and satisfied himself of her being the true owner
of the unclaimed stock, by their accurate resem-
blance. Mr. Christmas had discovered that both
accounts were marked ? dead ? four days before
the fraud was actually perpetrated. Mr. Christ-
conduct this prosecution, and having done so, our duty was dis-
charged ; and though the pamphlet contained inaccuracies of
which we had personally cause to complain, it might have
appeared oppressive to interfere with a document which we
regarded as a pleading, having in view a distinct object of Mr.
Barber. To such papers considerable latitude is allowed, and
we passed by its attacks upon ourselves as we have done
statements in the speeches of Mr. Barber?s counsel of which
we might justly have complained. But the insertion of a letter
in the Times imputing to us conduct personally and professionally
discreditable stands on a different ground, and we can no longer
forbear stating that so far as we are concerned the charge is
altogether untrue.,
? In conducting the prosecution against Mr. Barber we had to
discharge a most unpleasant office ; but we had no personal feel-
ing, and we confined ourselves to the strict discharge of our
professional duty.
?We are, Six', your obedient humble servants,
?J. C. AND H. Freshfield.
?New Bank-buildings, May 18, 1850.?
Undoubtedly, according to this letter, the charge as respects
Messrs. Freshfield personally, is unfounded. Yet it is a most
unfortunate letter, and compels an inference which I would
gladly have avoided, but which I dai'e not suppress.
Messrs. Freshfield admit that, in the exercise of their discre-
tion, the counsel for the prosecutors did not call Mr. Bix?cham
as a witness, though he was in attendance. Their ? understand-
ing ? that Mr. Bircham was under apprehension of legal pro-
ceedings on the part of creditors of the firm, and their sugges-
tion that, for this reason, he might not be generally accessible,
are not only groundless, but obviously beside the mark; such
appi?ehension, had it existed, was ratlxer a reason for anxious
communication with his partner, than for shunning him. But
as far as I can judge from their partnership accounts, there
was not a shadow of reason for any such apprehension. Mr.
Bircham at all events, must know better than Messrs. Fresh-
field, and it will be seen that in the letters of his which
Mr. Barber quotes, he adopts a very different tone. But
to return from this digression. Messrs. Freshfield admit


mas disclosed this fact to Fletcher, and thus, as
his official experience must have told him, put it
in that.man?s power to appropriate ï¿½6,000 more
under the same forged will, merely hy increasing
the probate duty. How much more may have
been known to Mr. Christmas we cannot pretend
to say: this is quite enough; and yet his inno-
nence is placarded?his evidence is placed beyond
exception; while Mr. Barber (against whom,
after weeks of surveillance by the police?after
unrestrained examination of all his papers, desks,
and drawers?not one tittle of evidence could be
found ultra the discharge of professional duty) is
placed in the felon?s dock ! !!
Once more. Mr. Barber pleaded for a separate
trial; if tried separately, he could have availed
himself of the evidence not only of Bifcham, but
of Fletcher, the Sanderses, and Mrs. Dorey; hut
a separate trial was refused him! Now, if there
ever was a case in which a separate trial should
the facts stated by Mr. Barber, and seek to shift the whole
responsibility on their counsel. They only charge untruth on
Mr. Barber as respects the application of the reproach 'personally
to themselves. The leading counsel for the prosecution was Mr,
Erie, the present judge ! If, then, we are to consider that
Messrs. Freshfield have, by their letter?, acquitted themselves of
the heinous charge of keeping Mr. Bircham out of the witness-
box, and then commenting on his absence to the prejudice of the
accused, they have only done so by transferring the reproach to
his lordship ! ! ! It may safely be left to the learned judge
himself to vindicate his forensic honour from such a stigma, if
he thinks it worth while ; for my part I must decline engaging
in a conflict between such august parties. lam only vindicat-
ing Mr. Barber, and for that purpose it is sufficient for me to
have thus gained an admission of the fact, that Mr. Bircham
was subpoenaed by the solicitor for the prosecution, was actually
in attendance, but by the discretion of some party or other
connected with the conduct of it, was not called, when his
evidence must have conclusively and for ever settled the guilt
or innocence of Mr. Barber, who was unable to discover and to
subpoena him.


be granted, not as a matter of indulgence, but
as a matter of right, it is where an attorney is
accused of complicity with his client. The rela-
tion is so intimate ?the very name of an attor-
ney almost implying an alter ego ?the inter-
course so necessarily exclusive of other wit-
nesses, and the mutuality of confidence so un-
reserved, that it is scarcely possible to suppose
a case in which the charge of complicity can be
fairly rebutted, unless the attorney can call his
client himself as a witness. We will put a case.
A solicitor receives instructions from his client
for an answer in chancery ; that client for-
swears himself; how could a solicitor acquit
himself of complicity, if shut out from the evi-
dence of his client, as to the instructions on which
he had acted ? It will not, we presume, be
denied that a solicitor is criminally responsible
for preparing and filing an answer which he
knows to be founded in perjury ; but the scientia
cannot be disproved with certainty, unless by the
evidence of the client who deceived him by his
oral instructions. It is no reply that the evi-
dence could avail but little, as no witness will
criminate himself; the privilege would not ex-
tend to questions that tended to the exculpation
of both. Let it go for what it is worth, the soli-
citor ought not to be shut out from such evidence,
being not only the best, but often the only evi-
dence available to him. Yet, in Mr. Barber?s case,
he was shut out from it entirely (though the subse-
quent confessions prove how valuable it was to
him), by the dexterous manoeuvre of a joint trial.
In the year 1828, it occurred to the writer to
publish some ? Practical Suggestions for the
Improvement of the Police,? derived essentially
from the knowledge he had acquired in the office
of the Bank solicitors. Within eighteen months


he had the satisfaction of seeing these suggestions
carried out almost to the letter. The principle
and many of the details of the present police
system will he found in the scheme then pre-
sented to the public; but there was one reform
which he then advocated in vain?the appoint-
ment of public prosecutors. This case of Mr.
Barber?s is about to be brought before Parlia-
ment, and these pages will be submitted to many
with the view of preparing them for the discus-
sion. It is earnestly hoped that this picture of
the injustice that may be worked in the manage-
ment of any prosecution by private hands, may
lead to a recognition of the necessity of hereafter
providing a remedy, by transferring such profes-
sional duty to the hands of public officers respon-
sible to Government and to Parliament.
To return to our subject, there was still another
incident in this unfortunate trial that told fatally
against Mr. Barber. After the case for the pro-
secution was closed, Mr. Justice Williams retired
for refreshment; on returning to the court he
passed Mr. Wilkins in the passage and made to
him the casual remark, ? I suppose you call no
witnesses.? The Serjeant took this as an intima-
tion that the case for the prosecution was weak,
and apprehensive of the disastrous effect of calling
every witness except Bircham who could not be
found, and Mr. Barber?s then solicitor, who was
confined to his room by sickness, determined to
act on the intimation ; witnesses were not called,
though all Mr. Barber?s clerks, to the number of
seven, were in attendance.
Let us briefly review Mr. Barber?s position at
this second stage of the case. It will be found on
perusing the reports of the trial, that no evidence
whatever had been given to prove participation in
the profits of the fraud; though, by the abrupt


course taken, free access was had to his most pri-
vate papers; though the prosecutors had the
opportunity of examining the whole ramification
of his pecuniary dealings, for he banked with the
Bank of England; though his conduct from hour
to hour had been watched by the police for more
than thren weeks, unknown to himself, and, as we
may fairly presume, no efforts or expense spared
to secure detection; it was all in vain. Nothing
could he found to justify a surmise that he had
derived profit or advantage from the felony with
which he was charged. The prosecutors were
conscious of the weakness of their case, and in
desperate effort to sustain it, relied on the circum-
stance of his carrying the bag of sovereigns !as
if any guilty man would have appeared at the
Bank counter at all, instead of keeping aloof from
all public appearance in the fraud, as Eletcher
did by waiting in the Rotunda. Yet, on this act
of common courtesy, connected with the politeness
of writing down the form of payment for a lady
with gouty hands, the prosecutors were compelled
to rely to prove a motive.
Again: most culprits, after such notice of sus-
picion as Mr. Ereshfield?s application must have
given to a guilty man, would have been discovered
by the vigilance of a spy, to be in anxious con-
ference from time to time with their confederates,
devising and plotting and contriving for escape,
arranging for sudden flight, destroying papers and
documents, or at least skulking from public obser-
vation. Mr. Barber, on the other hand, was proved,
by means of the very surveillance which was placed
over him, to be quietly pursuing his accustomed
duties for twenty-five days, without fear, without
disguise, and without a shadow of distrust.
Then, what was proved against him? Just
nothing; nothing whatever, except that he was the


solicitor of a consummate scoundrel?that for this
man he had transacted professional matters which
were as much incident to honest as dishonest
transactions?that all he did was done openly in
the usual course of his profession, daily recorded
in his hooks, and remunerated by the accustomed
fees. This was the extent of the evidence against
him, except that, recognising no authority in Mr.
James Treshfield to put the question, he refused
to give the name of his client without that client?s
permission, though at the same time he did give
him all other information that he could possibly
desire.
Why, then, was he convicted ? Those who ask
this question must necessarily be strangers to our
criminal courts. They know not how difficult it
is for even the most intelligent jury, to sever the
evidence affecting one man, and scarcely touching
another, when both are tried together in a long
and complicated case; nor how much this diffi-
culty is enhanced when they hear grandiloquent
encomiums on the Bank of England, the import-
ance of its prosecutions, their affected reluctance
in discharging a painful duty, their paramount
duty to the public, their commiseration for the
fall of such apparent respectability, with all the
parade of Bank cases, Bank counsel, Bank attor-
neys, Bank books, Bank clerks, and the rest of it.
Then the case had been agitated and argued ex
parte in newspapers and police reports for months,
and every mouth was full of it, and the court
swarmed with idle auditors whose very anxiety
apparent on their faces implied a foregone con-
clusion. When to all this is added a seeming
consciousness of guilt shown in forbearing to call
a single witness, and above all the absence of a
partner, good naturedly attributed not to coward-
ice, but to anxiety to screen a friend so intimately
Q 2


connected, it will cease to be a matter of surprise
that Mr. Barber was convicted. It is satisfactory,
however, now to find that all the jury have con-
curred in retracting their verdict and deeply re-
gretting it.*
Another question cannot be so readily answered.
If Mr. Barber was convicted for rendering pro-
fessional service to a felonious client, when de-
ceived by his apparent respectability, what soli-
citor is safe ? And assuredly this is a question
which it deeply concerns every solicitor to con-
sider. That which is Mr. Barber?s fate to-day,
may be Mr. Smith?s or Mr. Brown?s to-morrow.
It is in vain to answer, that such retainers may
be rejected. Some among the highest class may
pick and choose their clients; some among the
wealthy may venture to decline unpleasant busi-
* I have now obtained a copy of this retractation ; it does not
fully bear out the text, so it seems right to insert it:?
? We, the undersigned members of the jury, before whom
Mr. William Henry Bai'ber, with Joshua Fletcher, William
Sanders, Lydia Sanders, and Georgiana Dorey, was tried for
will forgery, in the case of Anne Slack, in April, 1844, having
learnt that he has experienced some opposition to the grant of
his certificate to practise as an attorney and solicitor, in con-
sequence of the verdict of guilty which we found against him
upon the evidence then laid before us, now feel called upon by
a sense of justice to declare that if the evidence contained in
the confessions of the said Joshua Fletcher, William Sanders,
Georgiana Dorey, and Lydia Sanders, and the other facts
which have transpired since the conviction of the said William
Heniy Barber, had been presented to us at the trial, and if the
explanation of apparently suspicious circumstances could have
been given before our verdict was returned, which has since
been afforded, we have no doubt whatever that we should have
acquitted Mr. Barber. The failure of justice, so far as concerns
him, arose in our judgment mainly from the fact of his not
having had a separate trial, and having been thereby precluded
from availing himself of the testimony of the other prisoners.

ness, even from old and accustomed clients; but
still it is a rule of almost universal application,
that to refuse a retainer is to retire from profes-
sional life. It is equally beside the mark to say,
that the risk is extremely rare. Such peculiar
forgery is, fortunately, not only infrequent, but
probably unique; but there are many cases in
which this new doctrine of responsibility for a
client?s crimes may apply as well as to Mr.
Barber?s.
Pawnbrokers are notoriously in the habit of
receiving stolen property. It may be innocently,
or it may be with guilty knowledge. In either
case, his attorney must defend his client?s title,
or lose his business. How can the attorney know
which cases fall within the guilty class?. His client
avers that all are honest; the attorney may have
ascertained many of them to be so. The client

following unimportant variation, namely, after the words,

Mr. Barber would have been acquitted.?)?
One of the jury (Mr. Rawlings) is since deceased ; another
juror admitted that a declaration of Mr. Barber?s innocence
by Fletcher and Sanders, at the trial, would have had material
Weight with him, but declined to sign any document; another
gentleman could not be prevailed upon to re-enter upon the
inquiry ; the twelfth member of the jury has been long absent
from London, and no opportunity has yet been afforded for
laying the necessary documents before him.


lives in outward respectability, pays his debts
with punctuality, trains up his children credit-
ably, and from time to time brings his hundreds
or his thousands to the attorney for investment.
Is the attorney warranted in suspecting ? Is he
bound to tell him that he distrusts the manner in
which this piece of silk, or that piece of broad-
cloth, was obtained ?
Or let the client be in some other trade?
a gold-refiner, for instance, or a money-changer ?
we need not be told of the facilities given by such
occupations to the most extensive robberies, or
how securely they obliterate the traces, and there-
fore the evidence of theft. When such clients are
put on their defence, is the attorney, because
always at their elbow to vindicate their title if
disputed, to be deemed an accomplice in their
guilt ?
The late Mr. Tawney was the habitual adviser
of three-fourths of the London horse-dealers; he
was nevertheless, an honourable solicitor and a
respectable man. We had it once from his own
lips, that half his clients of this class were horse-
chanters ; but that such was the character of the
trade, that they were as often dupes as rogues !
Would it have been reasonable to assume that he
was an accomplice in their frauds ?
A bill-discounter brings to his attorney, on the
average, fifty or a hundred bills per annum, with
instructions to sue, and in every case, as a thing
of course, supplies him with the requisite evidence
to prove the signatures. Half a dozen of these
bills are forged, or the fruit of gaming or swind-
ling. Is the attorney who enforces payment to
be suspected of complicity in the fraud? or of
culpable negligence because he failed to sus-
pect it?
A grocer or a tailor brings his usual batch at


Christmas of fifty bad or doubtful debts. The
attorney sues as he is instructed, and finds that
many have been duly paid. The same occurs in
every successive year, and his client admits the
irregularity, and ascribes it to the carelessness or
fraud of shop-boys; it may perhaps be true, or
it may as probably be false. Is the attorney to
suspect his client, if otherwise respectable, at the
penalty of being held his accomplice ? The cases
that have been supposed, seem to stand exactly
on the same ground as Mr. Barber?s.
There is not one of them in which a combina-
tion of circumstances may not be conceived,
without any violation of probability, under which
the attorney might be placed with his client in
the dock, convicted, and transported without the
possibility of meeting the charge of complicity, if
it is to be received as sound doctrine that the
render of professional service, aiding, though it
may be unconsciously, the commission of fraud,
is to be decisive as well as presumptive evidence
of guilt, unless the attorney can prove what is in
most instances all but impossible, the bona fides
of his confidence in his client?s honour, and of the
conversations of their private intercourse,
i It will not do to answer vaguely that there were
circumstances to awaken suspicion; ? that appear-
ances were strange;? that ?on the whole, he
must be deemed negligent;? it is this vague
generality of charge that has damaged Mr. Barber
far more than his conviction. Such observations
are the resource of idle minds, too indolent to
inform themselves, and too wilHng to take facts
on trust. There are no such circumstances.
They who think otherwise are bound to specify
them plainly and distinctly. The Court did
endeavour to enumerate some in its judgment,
but the Court had not the facts before them,


being shut out by a technical and unexpected
objection, and its impressions were altogether
erroneous. We have not yet heard any attempt
to specify one of these fancied circumstances; on
the other hand, there is observable in many
quarters an anxiety to cushion all that makes in
favour of Mr. Barber?s innocence.* There is one
curious example of this ingenuity; it deserves
especial mention. Let it be conceded, for argu-
ment?s sake, that Mr. Barber was guilty. It
must be supposed, in common sense, that his
* Lord Campbell does not profess, in his recent judgment, to
go into any circumstances indicating suspicion in Mr. Barber?s
mind, or creating a just demand for suspicion. His Lordship
rather seems to proceed on the hypothesis that he did suspect,
and that it cannot be contended otherwise :?? He must have
been wilfully blind,? observes his Lordship. But this is evading
and not grappling with the issue. Why must he have been
wilfully blind ? Fletcher?s letter of the 20th July, 1842, so
often quoted, proves that he was entirely blind in his, Fletcher?s,
conception, down to that period : that is, only ten weeks before
Slack?s case was brought to him. What, then, occurred subse-
quently to prove a wilfulness in his blindness 1 It is easy to
lay down a general position, but in such a case, and from such
authority a general position should be sustained by specific
facts. Can even one be mentioned 1 Was it wilful blindness
that he did not detect a forgery of handwriting where neither
he nor anybody else had ever seen the original ? or that he did
not discover that a lady whom he had never seen was thirty-
seven and not twenty-seven, as her brother-in-law untruly
represented 1 or that he failed to detect Mrs. Sanders? false hair
when he saw her for the first time in his life 1 or that he doubted
the possibility of a young lady with a fortune of only 6,000/.
forgetting that she had half as much again 1
And even putting aside for a moment the letter of the 20th
of July, conclusive as it is, was it wilful blindness that he did
not detect the leader of a gang of organised felons in a retired
surgeon, living with his family in apparent respectability, and
acknowledged wealth % Or, that he did not rise superior to
the tricks of a scoundrel who had deceived and defrauded the
Bank and all its officers for fifteen years 1 Or, that he did not
instinctively penetrate a dark conspiracy, so novel in its form,
that till 1843 it had never been imagined by the most wicked


object would be to pocket all he could, unless the
old adage is erroneous. He would prefer stealing
the sheep to the lamb, where the risk was the
same. In the case of Miss Slack, he might have
secured both sheep and lamb ; he might have
appropriated the ï¿½6,000, as well as the ï¿½3,500,
under colour of the same title. It was only
necessary to fix a higher duty on the probate.
The will, it is true, specifically bequeathed only
the minor sum. Mr. Barber must have known
that the pseudo executrix could claim both, and
in fact the Bank itself gave him as broad a hint
as need be, by marking both accounts ? dead,? as
passing to the executrix under the same will,
adepts in fraud ? Or, that he could not discriminate between
forged and genuine cases, all wearing exactly the same features ?
The judgment of Mr. Justice Patteson was unsatisfactory,
both to the public and to the profession, because it proceeded on
grounds which, when examined, were found not only insufficient,
but altogether erroneous. It does not appear to me that Lord
Campbell?s judgment has in any way vindicated Mr. Justice
Patteson?s by adopting the theory of wilful blindness without the
allegation of any grounds at all. The one says that he must
have suspected because, as an experienced solicitor, he ought to
have suspected. This syllogism is denied in all its pai?ts by the
public voice ; then Lord Campbell comes to the rescue ?not by
demonstrating either the premises or the deduction, but by laying
down the broad position?? If Mr. Barber was not directly
cognizant of the frauds in the forgery cases, or some of them, it
was because he must have been wilfully blind, and did not
choose to inquire into the character of these transactions.? This
is begging the whole question?a petitio principii, for which I
suspect that any stuff gown would be snubbed, even on his first
appearance. Why must he have been wilfully blind ? Why
should he have inquired into the character of any transaction
which presented itself with an honest" face ? In the absence
of any judicial explanation on these points, Mr. Justice Pat-
teson?s theory is as much open to question as before. Can either
of these learned and astute men take on himself to say, that had
he been called upon as counsel to advise on the very first of the
cases introduced by Fletcher, he would have suspected or in-
quired ? If he would, he would have suspected without cause.


Fletcher did not take the hint, because he was
not aware that by law the executrix could claim
the whole, and he dared not commit himself by
asking Mr. Barber, but Mr. Barber knew it.
How, then, did it occur, that as a guilty man,
and with notice that the Bank mistake was a
certain clue to detection, he failed to snatch at
the greater booty thus thrown within his grasp ?
Obviously because he believed the funds to belong
to different parties ; that is, in other words,
because he was innocent, and never dreamt of
fraud. Yet this remarkable feature was never
brought forward till the meeting of the Liverpool
attorneys on his behalf, on the 27th of November,
1850. However it might have escaped the notice
for it was a rightful claim ! Can either of them say that, on
advising on the second, he would have suspected or inquired
after a successful issue in the first I ?and not only have sus-
pected, but have turned round on the attorney who brought it
to his chambers?? Sir, I suspect you to be a swindler and a
felon, and the head of a gang of felons ! account for yourself, or
quit my room.? It is by our own conduct in such circumstances
that we must judge fairly of the bona Jides of others. I have
said that I would not myself have undertaken such business,
but I have nowhere said that I should have penetrated or sus-
pected its true character. I should have rejected it when fol-
lowed as a trade, for two reasons: the first is, that I should
have suspected it to be a colour for extortion under the con-
venient word ? compensation f and the second is, that in
common, I suppose, with all solicitors of regular practice, I have
an instinctive aversion to clients who gain their livelihood by
anomalous and eccentric pursuits. But with all my boasted
knowledge of criminal cases, and after five years? clerkship in
the office of the Bank solicitor, I cannot honestly say that I
think I should have detected, or even suspected, the special and
peculiar roguery of Fletcher, I have given a case at page 58 of
an ingenious forgery, in which shrewd attorneys, able counsel,
and an experienced judge, were all at fault, and where accident
alone brought the forgery to light; yet that forgeiy was trans-
parent as a sieve compared with Fletcher?s. Why is Mr. Barber
more censurable for not unmasking Fletcher, than I and my
counsel on that occasion ?


of others, it could not possibly have escaped the
Bank authorities, or any one conversant in their
practice. ?Yes,? it maybe answered, ?hut he
knew that to forge a will for unclaimed stock
was safe, hut to aim at the ï¿½6,000, which was
claimed, would he unsafe.? Very ingenious, hut
it will not do. When the fraud was being com-
pleted, it was as unsafe to attempt the one as the
other; both accounts had been marked ?dead?
four days before, and this was known to Mr.
Barber ; and that he knew it, was also known to
Mr. Preshfield on the 15th of November, three
weeks before the prosecution was instituted. This
reply, therefore, will not excuse the Bank. The
Directors of the Bank most assuredly were aware
of the omission to claim the larger sum, and it
rests on them to reconcile such knowledge with
the theory of Mr. Barber?s guilt.
Nor let them suppose, that if this case is
brought before Parliament, their conduct will go
unchallenged. It will not he forgotten, that in
the exercise of their official discretion, they se-
lected for prosecution, convicted, and transported
an innocent man ; that a very few years ago the
alleged offence was capital, and if convicted, that
Mr. Barber would certainly have been hanged,
were it only because he was an attorney and a
gentleman; that many scores, perhaps _we may
say hundreds, have been hanged for similar of-
fences, and selected for prosecution by similar
discretion ; and that the just value of this discre-
tion is now made patent in the selection of a
victim whose innocence was. virtually demon-
strated by the very first act which inquiry brought
under the official cognizance of the Bank
solicitors.
They may he assured that this is felt to he no
trifling matter, nor will either the conviction, or
R 2


the refusal of Mr. Barber?s certificate, avail to
establish ? reasonable and probable cause,?
against the strong presumption arising from the
incident just described, the value of which was
known to the Bank from the first; though to this
hour unknown to the jury, and never brought
before the Court.


PART 111.
It is most painful to follow the innocent con-
vict through his further career, yet it is not
without compensating interest of the most ab-
sorbing kind. If the spectacle of a great man
struggling with misfortune, has been justly pro-
nounced the noblest of all sights, it is not less so to
witness the ?mens conscici recti? sustaining the
convict in unexampled trials, so that his conduct
and deportment of themselves eventually led to
that piercing scrutiny, which could discover the
truth in defiance of all the clouds that temporarily
obscured it. What says Mr. Robertson, the se-
cond civil officer at Norfolk Island? ??I have
observed Barber?s conduct in the most trying and
humiliating circumstances, of what I am con-
vinced (without any reference to the question of
his innocence of the offence of which he stands
convicted) was unmerited suffering ; and while I
deeply pitied the man, I could but admire his
submissive demeanour, patient resignation, and
invariable rectitude of conduct, while his health
was visibly suffering, and his frame wasting away
under the mental torture inflicted upon him by
the degrading and polluting - association into
which he was forced, and the unmerited and
unaccountable persecution of which he was the
object for many months, by which the suffering
inseparable from his unhappy condition, was
deeply aggravated beyond that of even the worst


conducted convict, while his enemies could not
produce even a colourable charge against him.?
What says the Rev. T. B. Naylor, the chaplain ?
?? I have never known a prisoner of the Crown
who has been subjected to greater wretchedness;
I rejoice to be able to add, I have never seen an
instance of more dignified suffering, accompanied
by invariably consistent conduct.?
What says the Rev. T. Rogers, the succeeding
chaplain ??? I regret to say that the course pur-
sued towards Mr. Barber, on the part of the chief
officer of the island, was one of the most galling
severity; he was restricted to the barrack-yard,
while hundreds of the vilest desperadoes might
roam from station to station, under cover of a
pass; he was singled out for special contumely;
he was addressed in the most exasperating lan-
guage ; he was ordered to perform the most
loathsome labour ; he was deprived of indulgence
granted him by the medical officer for the reco-
very of his health; he was the only prisoner
interdicted writing materials; he wished to he
useful, hut for nineteen months he was perversely
refused the opportunity of being so : in short, his
life was reduced to a wearisome condition of
mental torture and of physical toil, dispropor-
tioned to his strength, and which his former
habits rendered peculiarly grievous. Yet I can
with all truth affirm, that I never knew his self-
command overcome by provocation, however
gross, nor his sense of injustice to betray him into
any unseemliness of resentment. On the con-
trary, he submitted to every indignity, no matter
how gratuitous, with all meekness; he complied
with every rule of discipline, no matter how vexa-
tiously imposed; he yielded all obedience to every
officer, no matter how unqualified to command;
he endured every privation with the calm forth


tude inspired by conscious innocence. Por eigh-
teen months I watched his demeanour, under the
accumulated wretchedness of convict slavery and
degradation; and while observing the invincible
patience with which he encountered the trials of
his exile, I have often said to myself, e lf this
man be not innocent, he deserves to be, from the
magnanimity evinced in this fearful struggle with
misfortune.? ?
It may not be out of place to observe, that Mr.
Barber, both in personal appearance and refine-
ment of taste and manner, is obviously one of
that class of society who would most acutely feel
the degradation here described. The officer then
in command at Norfolk Island, and by whom he
was subjected to this aggravation of punishment,
was Major Childs, and his apology for himself is,
that he acted by instructions. As he will have
to make this apology satisfactory to the House of
Commons, we will not prejudge him; even con-
vict felons are entitled to protection; and this
officer will probably find that Parliament will
sanction the doctrine, however strange it may
sound in his ears.
Mr. Barber was, in the first instance, sent in
# chains to the Penitentiary at Milbank ; and while
there he forwarded to Sir James Graham a me-
morial of his case. Though written under all the
disadvantages of imprisonment and deprivation
of his papers, this memorial contained abundant
and conclusive presumptions of innocence, had
any inquiry been instituted into the truth of its
statements. The answer to this memorial was
delayed for fourteen months, and then conveyed
in the laconic tone of office, that ? the Secretary
of State saw no reason to advise her Majesty to
mitigate the sentence.? Mitigate the sentence !
?there was no prayer for mitigation ! ?it was


the appeal of innocence for a reversal of it; and
had Sir Janies Graham deigned to do his duty,
and read that memorial, he would probably have
felt that further investigation was essential to the
course of justice. He never did read it. With
the indolence of elevated office, he entrusted it to
another; and that other to a third: and doubt-
less it was never read at all. Had Sir George
Grey been equally indifferent to the calls of duty
backed by humanity, Mr. Barber might have
been in Norfolk Island till now. But Sir George
Grey is cast in a very different mould.
All Mr. Barber?s other efforts to obtain a re-
hearing were alike ineffectual. The Governor of
Newgate and Sir John Musgrove (the late Lord
Mayor) seem to have been most anxious to assist
his efforts, but in vain. Mr. Bussell, the prisoner
inspector at Milbank, appears even then to have
entertained doubts of his guilt, and called at the
Home Office to learn the result of the memorial,
but obtained no other answer than ?he is
to go.?
He was sent on board the convict ship the
Agvncourt , and before the vessel left Woolwich,
Fletcher had declared, before Mr. Fuller, the
medical superintendent of the ship, that Mr.
Barber was innocent; but, though this should
have fortified the memorial for investigation, it
was all in vain.
On landing at Norfolk Island, Mr. Fuller, the
surgeon superintendent, made a very favourable
report of Mr. Barber?s behaviour, and Captain
Lavers, a superintendent of convicts, applied for
him to be his clerk. The application was refused,
as was another of the same kind from Lieutenant
Lloyd. Other prisoners, one on his second trans-
portation, were selected for these light duties, and
Mr. Barber was appointed to the filthy office of


cleaning the prisoners? wards. He was kept at
this labour, being the most disgusting that could
have been found for him, for sixteen months, with
only casual intervals of sickness, caused by the
nature of the work.
At the end of this time he was sent to work in
the field in one of the ? heaviest gangs,? with a
second transported felon for his overseer, a man
notorious for his severity. In this position he
was compelled to perform the same tasks as men
of far greater physical power, who had been used
to labour all their lives; yet, at this very time,
there were employed as clerks, or schoolmasters,
or in other light occupations, in every station in
the island, convicts who had been transported a
second time, and who had arrived more recently
than himself. Several of these men thus pre-
ferred to him, had been even convicted of serious
crimes in the island, while undergoing their sen-
tence. Even Eletcher was exempted from severe
labour, and employed as ? medical dispenser,?
with a private apartment, superior rations and
superior bedding, besides possessing the privilege
of sending his fellow-prisoners to heavy work,
light work, or no work at all, at his discretion or
pleasure. Let this be compared with the situa-
tion of his victim. Mr. Barber was ? herded ?
with hundreds of other convicts; sleeping in a
barn, with two hundred inmates, with only a
single blanket to cover him, sometimes washed
out of his hammock by torrents of rain pouring
through the roof; obliged to watch and keep
order in this dormitory by night, and to clean it
by day. To render his suffering more severe, a
special order was issued, to confine him to ? the
camp,? being a small area round the barracks,
while other prisoners were allowed to go from
station to station to visit their acquaintance.


Mr. Barber had found in one of his fellow-
convicts, a man of intellectual and amiable cha-
racter ; this acquaintance visited him in ? the
camp,? but as soon as it was discovered, all
intercourse was strictly forbidden, and this
though such restrictions were not imposed on
any others. The police of the island, themselves
among the worst of its inhabitants, were ordered
to keep him under close surveillance ; and seeing
that he was ? a marked man,? subjected him to
every insult and annoyance they could invent.
It was to be expected, under such circum-
stances, that his health would give way, and
accordingly he was attacked with dysentery, and
became dangerously ill. Dr. Graham, the medical
attendant, attributed it to his occupation, and
on his recovery, recommended his removal to
another part of the island. This was refused in
Mr. Barber?s case, though permitted in others.
The consequence was a relapse. Dr. Graham
entered a strong protest in the visiting-book, and
ordered him back to the hospital. Still no altera-
tion in his duties could be obtained, till at last
the chaplain felt it right to support the doctor?s
remonstrance, and represented that his life was
endangered.
But we will not pursue these horrors in further
detail. The commandant has pleaded in apology
for them, as has been already mentioned, that he
so acted ?in obedience to instructions.? What
were these ? instructions,? and by whom given ?
There is such indication of latent and vindictive
malice somewhere, that Sir James Graham, the
party officially responsible, must ? explain.? It
would be absurd to suppose that such instructions
would emanate from him personally; but there
must have been some influence at work in his
office, and suspicion naturally points to the source


of it. It becomes necessary, for the honour of
parties whose names it is superfluous to mention,
that they should be acquitted of the suspicion by
tracing the ? instructions ? to their source. If
the apology is without foundation, then the
commandant must acquit himself as best he may
of this needless, and, to all appearance, malicious
aggravation of punishment. The course of pro-
ceeding is very simple. Several members, if we
are rightly informed, are prepared to move for
the production of these ? instructions? as well as
for a committee of inquiry into the whole case.
With one more fact we will leave this part of the
history.
Mr. Barber wrote nine letters, stating to in-
fluential friends in England the particulars of his
treatment. The Bev. Mr. Naylor, the chaplain,
also wrote several letters, stating the favourable
evidence he had obtained of Mr. Barber?s inno-
cence ; one of these letters was addressed to Lord
Brougham. The letters were, according to pre-
scribed rule, forwarded through the local au-
thorities, but none reached their destination.
Mr. Barber?s were sent to his prosecutor?s, and
Mr. Naylor?s were detained. The moral atmo-
sphere of a penal colony seems so tainted, that
none can breathe it in safety. One of the chap-
lain?s letters was addressed to Sir Bobert Peel.
It got no further than Hobart Town, where Mr.
Barber found and reclaimed it, eighteen months
afterwards. At last it became known that Mr.
Barber was employing his few moments of leisure
in preparing a statement of his case, and then, by
way of precluding the possibility of his being
heard, all his remaining papers were seized,
several of them being of vital importance to his
exculpation, and he was debarred by special order
the use of pen and ink.

We know not how far this matter will tell with
the public. In these days it is most difficult to
get a dozen lines into an influential paper, except
as an advertisement, and equally so to get a
pamphlet read. People will read nothing hut
newspapers and romances ; and it is the accepted
rule to pooh-pooh everything that threatens
trouble or annoyance. We will hope, however,
for the sake of other convicts, that facts like these
will not he easily cushioned.
Mr. Barber?s exemplary conduct obtained friends
for him even among the wretched class with whom
he was associated. The convicts themselves were
provoked to inquiry, and Sanders from the first
avowed Mr. Barber?s innocence. The freedom of
conversation between convicts led to many dis-
closures from Pletcher, and the results from time
to time reached the ears of the chaplain, and also
of Mr. Pielding Brown, a barrister and judge of
the criminal court at Norfolk Island. These
gentlemen, when they thus received such cumu-
lative testimony to Mr. Barber?s innocence, felt it
to be their duty to sift it, as well by the examina-
tion of the convicts who reported the conversa-
tions, as of Mr. Barber himself. The more the
case was sifted, the more apparent his innocence
became. Pirst, there was the confession of Sanders,
made on the 12th December, 1843, and afterwards
formally declared on the 9th July, 1844. This
was followed by a partial confession of Pletcher?s
on the 28th June, 1844, which was subsequently
extended, and formally declared, as a second con-
fession in July. Then came statements made by
Smith, an intimate friend of Pletcher, and formerly
on the Stock Exchange. These statements, the
last of which was declared in articulo mortis , on
the 6th November, 1844, gave the result of several
conversations between the declarant and Pletcher


and Sanders. This was followed by a similar
statement from William M?Cullnm, another
intimate of Fletcher?s.
The Uev. T. B. Naylor, and Deputy-Assist ant
Commissary-General J. W. Smith, were so im-
pressed with the full corroboration afforded by
these concurrent statements to the explanation of
Mr. Barber, that they volunteered an investiga-
tion, and in the Report, which they signed, they
conclude with these emphatic words :
? Notwithstanding the corruptness of Fletcher?s
character, he must have been, had he been
examined as a witness, not only compelled to
admit, as he has to us, a mass of facts incom-
patible with Barber?s guilt, as shown in the
memorial, but at the same time detected in a
course of prevarication sufficient to remove all
idea of collusion, and thus to stamp his reluctant
testimony with authenticity.?
This Report is dated the 28th of January,
1815 ; and Mr. Naylor also wrote the following
letter to Sir Robert Feel on the Bth of September
following:?
? Sir, ?Having a full persuasion of the entire innocency of
William Henry Barber, whose letter entreating your attention
to his case has just been shown me, I feel that no apology is
necessary for the intrusion of this letter upon your time.
? I am bound in justice to declare, that I have not ceased,
during the whole period Barber and Fletcher have been here,
to sift the transaction with which they stand charged, with
minute and zealous scrutiny, and that the result has been to
render me uneasy until I have made every effort in my humble
power towards the extrication of Barber. From Fletcher?s
reluctant confessions and explanations, given under the worst
possible feelings towards Barber, I cannot for one instant have
a doubt either of the deep treachery of Fletcher, or the entire
absence of any guilty collusion or knowledge on the part of
Barber. He is suffering so much, and so undeservedly, that I
should be ashamed were I to fail in my duty towards him, or in
urging upon you, Sir, as a matter of simple justice, a further


investigation of this most singular case. I feel certain that any
such inquiry would end in an acquittal of this unhappy victim
of a most cunning conspiracy.
?I do not enter into any of the details. They are contained
in a memorial of Barber?s, already transmitted through the
authority here, and I would not trespass unnecessarily one
moment upon the time of the Prime Minister of Great Britain,
but I entreat him as such not to allow any consideration to
prevent the rescue of an innocent man from unmerited suffering
and degradation. ? I have, &c. &c.
? T. Beagly Naylor, Chaplain.
?Norfolk Island, Bth September, 1845.?
This is the letter which, as has been just men-
tioned, was suppressed by the Colonial autho-
rities. It would appear that courage was wanting
to destroy it, for on Mr. Barber?s arrival at Hobart
Town, nineteen months after it was despatched
from Norfolk Island, he found it still in the office
of the Comptroller-General of Convicts! The
reader will not fail to observe that this was not
the letter of a convict, but of the chaplain of the
station, written officially to the Premier. It
argued no common audacity even to detain it for
a single day: such an act can scarcely fail to
attract the notice of Sir George Grey, and it may
be hoped will even yet be visited with punish-
ment.
Dr. Browning, 8.N., Surgeon-Superintendent,
instituted a similar investigation, and personally
examined many of the convicts. On the Bth of
April, 18P7, he also made a formal note of a very
minute personal examination of Pletcher and
Barber, separately as well as face to face, and he
certifies to the satisfactory and conclusive result
of his inquiries.
Mr. Thomson, the Registrar of convicts, also
made an official report of his examination of
William Sanders; and, lastly, the Rev. T. Rogers,
who succeeded Mr. Naylor as chaplain, received


full corroboration of all that Mr. Naylor and Mr.
Smith had previously reported on the 30th of
June, 1817.
All these served to expose the complicated
artifices by which Mr. Barher had been beguiled.
As that exposure has been already made in the
previous pages, it seems needless to incur the
expense of reprinting the documents themselves,
especially as they are now in a state to he pro-
duced in evidence before the court, when Mr.
Barber renews his application.*
It is not easy to collect, from the papers before
us, how many, or which of these documents were
submitted to Sir George Grey; nor have we
immediate access to Mr. Barber to ascertain these
particulars. In fact, we have felt it due to him
to refrain from conferring with him, while this
review of his case is in preparation, that we may
truly say that our conclusions are the fruit of a
careful examination of the evidence, and of that
alone. There is but one comparatively trifling
incident which has been obtained from any other
source. It is right that professional readers
should understand, that if on this statement of
the case it is impossible to withhold a conviction
of his entire innocence, the sources from which it
* Copies of all these documents will be found in a pamphlet,
entitled ?The case of Mr. W. H. Barher,? published by
Effingham Wilson, Royal Exchange. They were produced
before the Court, but as the rule nisi was refused, and no
argument ensued, they failed to gain notice ; it may seem a
bold remark (and such boldness might be dangerous but for
the latitude conceded in modern times to public criticism, even
when proceeding from professional men), but I cannot forbear
the remark that more anxiety has been shewn throughout, to
vindicate a course which neutralizes the royal pardon, than to
investigate with candour and fairness the grounds on which it
was granted. I can recall no previous instance in which legal
ingenuity has been strained to decide a doubt adversely to an
accused party.


has been compiled have long been accessible to
them, and before the public.
A conditional pardon was granted to Mr. Barber
on the 16th of April, 1847, the condition being
that he should not return to the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland.
Shortly before this pardon arrived, Mr. Barber
had been removed, with 300 other prisoners, from
Norfolk Island to Impression Bay, in Tasmania.
This removal was in consequence of Mr. Naylor?s
exposure of the horrid system prevailing at Nor-
folk Island; for, fortunately, all the official letters
of this estimable clergyman were not suppressed
by authority.
The persecution of Mr. Barber did not terminate
with his pardon. He had been utterly ruined by
this unwarrantable charge (we use the term
advisedly, for we have proved to demonstration
that it was, from facts before the Bank directors,
necessarily a charge without warrant). He had
not the funds required even for his defence.
When he was put on board the convict-ship, he
was entirely destitute, even of clothing; hence,
when on receiving his pardon he was ordered to
divest himself of his prison dress, he remonstrated
on the ground that he had no other; but too
much humanity cannot be laid to the charge of
convict superintendents : his remonstrance fell on
idle ears.
? You must give in your prison clothing, and
proceed to Hobart Town, where you will receive
the necessary document.?
? What clothes am I to travel in ??
? I have no orders about that I?
And this amiable superintendent, whose name
we would publish for the benefit of embryo con-
victs, but we have it not, compelled him to strip,


as the most convenient preparation for a walk of
ninety miles through a wilderness of jungle.
But Mr. Barber, in the midst of all his suffer-
ings and. affliction, had not been forgetful that,
even in Norfolk Island, good might be done.
After the exhaustion of labour through heat and
rain, under the tyranny of a brutal overseer, and
amidst the gibes and jeers of thieves and mur-
derers, and all the vilest ruffians of a convict
gang, he retained strength and calmness to devote
the evening to the instruction of his fellow-
prisoners, though thwarted even in this useful
work by being deprived, wantonly, of the writing
materials he required. This had gained for him
the affection of the degraded men, and now that
he was discharged, in utter nudity, a passage by
sea, even, being denied him, the convicts fitted
him out among themselves, supplied him out* of
the scanty means they had retained, one with a
coat, another with trowsers, and so forth, till at
last he was enabled to start, in the guise of a
scarecrow, upon his long and solitary journey.
It was, indeed, a painful journey. There was
no beaten road to Hobart Town, and scarcely a
sheep-path occasionally visible. His course was
through dense woods, and over mountains, with
no guide but a general knowledge of the hearings
of Hobart Town, and the stars and sun for his
compass. Sometimes he had streams to ford, and
rugged rocks to climb, without even a shed for
shelter, or seeing a single individual to direct
him.
But he had an inward and a fixed resolution
that sustained him, and an object worthy of the
resolution. He was 20,000 miles from Paris, hut
to Paris he was bent on going, there to begin
the yet more arduous work of establishing his


thorough, innocence in the face of all mankind, in
defiance of the prejudices that opposed him, and
of the enemies whose powerful influence had
pursued him with relentless hostility to the very
end of the world. What were ninety miles of
pilgrimage with such a motive to exertion ? He
accomplished it in three days and nights, and
then presented himself at the house of his kind
and excellent friend, the Rev. T. Rogers. Here
he first learned hy what means his pardon had
been obtained. The former chaplain, Mr. Naylor,
had sent Mrs. Naylor and their child to England.
This lady, whose exertions for Mr. Barber were
only inferior to her husband?s, carried with her
his memorial and papers, and they found, in the
prompt benevolence of Sir George Grey, that
humane attention which was sought in vain at the
hahds of Sir James Graham. Official investiga-
tion was instantly set on foot, and Mr. Barber
was pardoned.
A qualified pardon, however, was not a recogni-
tion of innocence, and would not, therefore, satisfy
an honourable mind. Mr. Barber staid two
months under the hospitable roof of Mr. Rogers,
and then embarked for Sydney; his first step
there was to entreat the Sydney Law Society to
examine into his case. The bar of Sydney is
perhaps stronger and more numerous than in any
other colony, and includes many gentlemen of
high legal talent. It was felt due to a profes-
sional brother, though a stranger, to comply with
such a reasonable request. A committee of their
body was appointed for the purpose, and this
committee continued its sittings for ten days con-
secutively, when they prepared and published the
following report:?


? Pursuant to the resolution by which, in compliance with
Mr. Barbers request, the Society undertook the investigation
of his case, and formed itself, for that purpose, into committee,
it has held daily meetings, from the 29th ultimo to the Bth
instant inclusive. At these meetings the entire report of the
trial of Mr. Barber, which ended in his conviction and trans-
portation, has been carefully read through, as published in
the London daily papers. Also, the report of the previous
examination at the Mansion House, and various contemporary
correspondence and editorial comments relating to the subject.
? The Society, having thus possessed themselves of the case
as fully as possible, in the form in which it was presented to
the jury, and the English public at the time of the conviction,
they proceeded carefully to investigate the subsequently acquired
evidence, and heard the explanation by means of which Mr.
Barber had already succeeded in possessing the minds of so
many competent jndges with a full persuasion of his innocence.
? The result of such investigation has been to establish the
same persuasion in the minds of the Society ; nor can they have
any doubt that far less exculpatory evidence than has been laid
before them would have rendered it impossible for the jury to
bring in a verdict of guilty against Mr. Barber.
? Hone of the circumstances on which Mr. Barber?s pro-
secutors chiefly relied as evidence of guilt, were, in fact, in-
compatible with his innocence. Great stress was laid on the
tracing to him of a bag of six hundred sovereigns, which he
carried away for, or with, Mrs. Sanders, when she received the
money at the Bank of England. The Society cannot see how
an attorney?s knowledge of his client?s fraud can be inferred
from an act which, if innocent, he would have been equally,
and, for some reasons, more likely to have performed, namely,
the carrying a heavy bag of coin for a lady who either had, or
appeared to have, the gout in her hands.
? Again : great stress was laid upon the circumstances which
pointed out the identity of Captain Foskett?s sister-in-law with
the true owner of the stock, and which it is argued must have
convinced Mr. Barber of such identity, and so proved his bad
faith in lending himself to any other claimant. When, how-
ever, Captain Foskett cannot deny that he represented his
sister?s age as twenty-seven?and the nature of Messrs. Barber
and Bircham?s impressions of her age, derived from this source,
is evident from their alluding to her as ? the young lady? in a
eotemporary letter of business?and when it is evident that no
person of such an age could possibly have been owner of the
stock, it is surely too nrnch. to take it for granted against Mr.
Barber, that because other strong indications of identity existed,
he must necessarily have solved the mystery in favour of Miss
T 2


Slack, by disbelieving what her brother-in-law, Captain Foskett,
had stated upon this material fact, inventing for a lady he had
never seen the different age of thirty-seven. On many other
points, the peculiar position of an attorney in conducting the
affairs of his client was conducive to fallacious inferences against
Mr. Barber. It was assumed by the prosecution, that whatever
was stated as fact in Mr, Barber?s correspondence, or otherwise
acted on by him, such as the result of a comparison of hand-
writing, was a fact he had personally investigated, and of which
he must himself have known the truth or falsehood ; whereas
every attorney, and almost every client, well knows that facts
resting on clients? bare instructions are necessarily blended and
confounded with those resting on personal knowledge in the
common course of professional business.
? This general consideration, although above applied only to
one circumstance, will be found to clear away a large part of
what appears, on a superficial glance at the evidence, to raise
suspicion against Mr. Barber.
? With respect to Mr. Barber?s concealment of the name of
his client, Fletcher, at his interview with Mr. Freshfield, it is
to be observed that a reason for this concealment existed,
irrespective altogether of any question of the crime of forgery,
namely, the desire of Fletcher to avoid inquiry into the source
of his information regarding unclaimed dividends,- a source
which he does not seem, judging from the testimony of Mr.
Christmas, to have ever revealed even to Mr. Barber himself;
nor, were this separate motive absent, is it clear that an
attorney would be justified in disclosing the name of a client
in connection with a primd fade case of guilt, without first
availing himself of all the means in his power to clear up the
facts, and accompany the disclosure with an explanation by
way of antidote. A conscientious attorney might, even from
very scrupulosity, feel bound to pause and consider before
making such a revelation.
? To judge of the propriety of all that fell from Mr. Barber in
this conversation, is not the task which the Society has under-
taken ; and were it so, they would have first to consider whether
Mr. Freshfield?s statements be sufficiently accurate or complete
to enable them to form an opinion. Mr. Barber solemnly
denies its accuracy in many important respects, while Mr.
Freshfield, on the trial, himself more than admits its incom-
pleteness ; nor could it be fairly judged of without a knowledge
even of the tone of voice and manner assumed by both parties.
On the whole, it is a relief to the Society to be freed from all
obligation to disentangle the perplexities in which this piece of
evidence is involved, inasmuch as with the light now thrown by
other means on the case, the conversation between Mr. Barber


and Mr. Freshfield is in no imaginable point of view material
to a decision upon the main question of Mr, Barber?s innocence
of the crime imputed to him.
? So weak was, indeed, the case proved against him, that if
the prosecutors had not resisted his application for a separate
trial, the Society cannot conceive it possible that any jury could
have found him guilty. The Society cannot conceive any case
which more peculiarly required a separate trial. From the very
nature of the case, it was scarcely possible that any one indi-
vidual, besides the other accused parties, could possess actual
knowledge whether Barber had been really the confederate or
the victim of their fraud ; and a sifting examination of those
persons, whatever their character, was at least a safer channel
to the truth, than the vague case of suspicion and remote in-
ference which, so far as Barber was concerned, was presented to
the jury on the joint indictment. When it is also considered
that the prosecution had access to Mr. Barber?s diary, and had
followed in vain several tracks of inquiry which might have
been naturally expected to afford proof of guilt, had guilt
existed ; also, that in a complicated transaction of this nature,
the concurrent and consistent testimony of the four other accused
persons in any story exculpating Barber, so as to stand cross-
examination, would have been next to a miracle, unless such
story were true, and this particularly when all intercourse
between them appears to have been carefully prevented from
the moment of their apprehension, the refusal appears still more
extraordinary, and the Society cannot but regard it as the main
cause of Mr. Barber?s unmerited sufferings, and a fearful excep-
tion to the usual tenderness and caution of English justice.
? The Society also think, if the trials had been separate, the
examination of Mr. Barber, in like manner, on the trial of the
other parties, could hardly have failed of itself effectually to
have removed all doubts of his own guilt, had it existed, ?a
thing of infinitely greater importance in giving useful effect to
exemplary punishment, than the mere fact of the conviction of
a supposed criminal, especially on doubtful or unsatisfactory
evidence.
? The soundness of these views is manifest from the conduct
of the whole of the parties after their conviction, from which,
under less favourable circumstances than separate trials would
have afforded, more real light has been- cast on the transaction
than by the judicial investigation in which a jury was called on
to grope after the truth in the comparative darkness resulting
from the exclusion of the only direct testimony accessible. The
Society are not, indeed, blind to the general worthlessness of ex-
culpatory statements made by accused persons in favour of each
other, yet they cannot but perceive that in this case the conduct


of Barber and Fletcher, and the statements of the latter, stand
on peculiar grounds, and are therefore entitled, especially when
other circumstances concur, to peculiar weight. It is evident,
from the testimony of the present civil commandant of Norfolk
Island, Mr. Fuller, the Rev. T. B. Naylor, and assistant-com-
missary-general I, W, Smith, the Rev. Thomas Rogers, Dr.
Browning, and others, that Fletcher painfully felt, that but for the
statements of Barber, the part he took in the transaction might
have been kept out of sight, or that an opportunity of escape at
least have been afforded him. He, too, could not be uncon-
scious that the admission of Barber?s innocence would, by
adding to the crime of which he had been convicted, that of
having occasioned the ruin and conviction of a highly respect-
able man, expose him to the just abhorrence of every honest
man, and take away all hope of mitigation.
? The Society conceive the sum of Mr. Barber?s offence to be
that of allowing himself to be employed by a very wealthy and
apparently respectable man, in tracing out the owners of un-
claimed dividends, ?a course of practice which unavoidably sub-
jects the parties concerned to be made the dupes of artful and
unprincipled persons. They do not feel entitled to express dis-
approbation of a course which has been adopted by men of
undoubted honour and integrity, and still less to admit tliat it
ought of itself for a moment to subject the party to the impu-
tation of fraud, or even improper motives. It may be said, that
the perpetrator of such a fraud was not likely to select an honest
attorney ; but it is often of the greatest importance to persons
engaged in nefarious practices to employ upright and honourable
men, the character of whom cannot fail to avert suspicion, but
who must, of course, be kept in profound ignorance of the evil
character of the acts to be accomplished; and in this considera-
tion may be found a sufficient motive for the various arts which
were employed to blind Mr. Barber, and effectually impose upon
his judgment.
?On the whole, the Society feel an unanimous persuasion
that Mr. Barber was entirely innocent of the fraud practised by
Fletcher ; that it is chiefly, if not wholly, in consequence of his
being shut out, by a joint indictment, from the most obvious
and certain means of eliciting the truth, that he has endured the
disgrace and misery of conviction and unmerited punishment,
and that he is entitled to every assistance in his endeavour to
resume his position in society, not to speak of reparation, could
any reparation be possible, or, if possible, sufficient in such a
case. (Signed)
?James Norton, President,
?Sydney, 16th August, 1847.?


This report was followed up by a general sub-
scription, which included forty barristers and
solicitors, besides the chief justice and the puisne
judges.
Mr. Barber was invited and strongly urged to
establish himself in the colony, where there was
every prospect of great professional success; hut
he declined. His character was of more moment
to him than money. Being, therefore, thus pro-
vided with means, he embarked for China, the con-
dition of his pardon compelling him to take this
circuitous route. He was detained at Canton for
a month before he could find a passage to India.
On the 4th of December, 1847, he was invited to
join in that excursion into the interior which,
from its fatal results, excited such sensation in
England. It will he remembered that the party
consisted of six gentlemen, all well armed; they
were impeded in their progress by some of the
natives, when a quarrel ensued ; they were over-
powered by numbers, after a desperate resistance,
and being captured, were cruelly murdered. Mr.
Barber did not join them, only because he hap-
pened to have a pre-engagement at Whampoa.
A second escape from imminent peril occurred in
his voyage to Madras. In a dead calm, the Grey-
hound, in which he had embarked, nearly drifted
on the sunken rock off Singapore, known as the
Pedro Branca reef. It seems not too strong an
expression to say that he was specially protected
by an overruling Providence, in this honourable
path that he had taken, regardless of the tempta-
tions to abandon it for wealth at Sydney, and
presently about to be renewed at Madras. There,
too, the press and the bar took up his case volun-
tarily and with spirit; not less than fourteen
barristers, the chief justice, and four puisne
judges, headed a subscription in his behalf,


avowedly proceeding on the ground of proved
and established innocence?one of the judges, Sir
William Burton, preparing with his own pen the
statement on which the appeal was made to the
sympathy of the profession. Mr. Barber was
thus enabled to take the overland route to Paris,
where he arrived on the 4th of May, 1848.
The Marquis of Normanby was found readily
accessible on a case involving injustice and
inhumanity. He did not content himself with a
good-natured expression of sympathy, but he took
the documents and studied them, making himself
master of the case. He then sent for Mr. Barber,
avowed the powerful impression which they had
made upon his mind, and offered to transmit
them to Sir George Grey. This was done, and
the appeal to the Secretary was further supported
by some eminent solicitors in England. We are
not informed of their names, but it appears, that,
though personally unknown to Mr. Barber, they
requested an interview on the subject with Sir
George Grey, and, at his desire, submitted to him,
in writing, their reasons for the conviction that
his innocence was indisputable. These reasons,
and the documents at the Home Office, had their
deserved weight, and a free pardon was the result.
Thus was this persecuted man at length enabled
to return in honour and acknowledged innocence
to his native country; and he landed at Hover,
after five years? absence, most of it spent as a
convict in a penal settlement, destitute of a
shilling, and robbed by his unjust prosecution of
means, of prospects, of clients, of profession, of
all but a character, tardily acknowledged to be
free from stain.


PART IV.
It is indeed an odious task to review his recep-
tion here; but it must he done. We enter upon
this part of the case with pain and reluctance. It
might have been supposed that Mr. Barber?s
return to England, under such circumstances,
would have been hailed with satisfaction by his
professional brethren ?that if a cloud had been
thrown over the general character of the pro-
fession by the conviction of one of its members on
a charge of felony, the complete though long-de-
layed exculpation from that charge by the highest
authority in the realm, would have given un-
qualified satisfaction to every solicitor in the
country. It was not ?a happy escape? from
merited, but a just release from unmerited
punishment. In our view, Mr. Barber must be
considered more in the light of a victim to pro-
fessional duty, than a man who has prostituted
skill to fraudulent purposes ; and though there
may be dissentients among the Incorporated Law
Society ?or rather among its Council?we firmly
believe, from all the conversations we have had
with others, that there are not ten solicitors in
England, out of their immediate influence, who
are not of the same opinion ; certainly not in the
number of those who have looked into the case,
and made themselves capable of judging of its
merits and demerits.
We do not deny that it is the duty of the
Council of the Law Society to exclude improper
characters from admission to the profession, so
far as it has the power ; still less do we contend


that the courts have not the power to determine
on the fitness of their officers ; though even this
is limited, like the rest of their jurisdiction, by
precedent, and has never, in any previous instance,
been carried so far. But the power in the one
case, and the duty in the other, depend on the
proof of the impropriety ; and we challenge con-
tradiction to our assertion?not contradiction in
vague and general terms which cannot he
grappled with, but in specific charges on which
issue may be taken?that no proof whatever has
been, given of any professional conduct in Mr.
Barber which borders on impropriety. The Court
of Queen?s Bench has avowedly thrown aside all
the charges of alleged malpractice,* as not sufficient
to influence their judgment; yet it may he con-
ceived with what diligence and anxiety these
charges were got up, when the most recent of
them was of seven years? date, and the earliest
not less than thirteen !?and they were preferred
against a man who, it was known, had lost all
his books and papers in consequence of a prosecu-
tion now confessed to he groundless; who had
been five years absent from the country, a
prisoner at the antipodes ; who had been so
utterly ruined as then, and still, to he reduced to
destitution ! Nevertheless, thus defenceless, he
was put upon his trial a second time?no less for
the forgeries of which he had been declared
innocent, than for all the imaginary sins that
could he raked up against him by inquisitorial
scrutiny into the minutest passages of his life!!!
This, too, upon an occasion when, as we respect-
fully submit, his application should have been
granted as a matter of course; as the judges
* It is worth, remark that one of the clients in respect of
whom some of the alleged malpractices were charged, has lately
retained Mr. Barber?s present employer expressly to avail himself
of Mr. Barbells professional ability.


expressly laid it down, that the effect of the
pardon of the Crown placed Mr. Barber in the
same position as he would have been had a verdict
of Not Guilty been pronounced, in which case the
renewal of his certificate would have been a
matter of right; he could only have been deprived
of it upon an application to strike him off the
roll; and a strong case must have been made out
against him, before he could he called upon for
an answ r er.
Our impression of.the duty of every professional
self-organised society, whether incorporated or
not, is, that the protection of an injured brother
is as essential a part of it as the exclusion of un-
deserving men from its fraternity. However, in
this part of their proceedings the Society has been
signally defeated. Among the Council of the
Law Society, there are few whom we do not suffi-
ciently know by reputation to be assured of their
honourable intentions. There are some whom we
know so well, that if we could induce them to
read and master the evidence for themselves , apart
from all prejudice as parties to the conflict, we
would as willingly leave the final judgment to
their arbitrament, as to all the judges in the Ex-
chequer Chamber. But it is our firm persuasion
that none of these gentlemen have read the case ,
still less the evidence; and that the Council, in
the first instance, took it up unadvisedly, on the
report of others (whom we suspect but will not
name), and that then, finding themselves com-
mitted by precipitation, they have felt compelled
to proceed, not from hostility to Mr. Barber, nor
from continued distrust of his fitness, but because
the credit of the Council has been thought to be
involved in the event.*
* I have good reason for believing that several of the most
eminent names among the Council of the Society were, till the

It is necessary to explain to the non-professional
reader, that every attorney is obliged to pay an
annual duty, for which payment he receives a
certificate. Without this certificate he cannot
legally practise. If he has omitted for a year to
take it out, he cannot practise again without
special leave from the Court, and the leave is only
given upon a satisfactory explanation of his rea-
sons for having neglected to pay the annual duty,
and a satisfactory account of his residence and
occupation duri/ng the interval. As Mr. Barber
had been unable to take out his certificate for five
years, it became necessary for him to apply to the
Court for its permission to renew it, and of course
to give the requisite explanations. Had Sir James
Graham been as ready to do his duty as Sir George
Grey, Mr. Barber would have been pardoned im-
mediately, and no application to the Court would
have been necessary, as his practice would not
have been suspended for a year.
Being necessary, however, Mr. Barber gave a
term?s notice of his application in the usual form
for Hilary Term, 1849. On being mentioned to
the Court, it was opposed on behalf of the Incor-
porated Law Society, when it was suggested by
the Court, rightly appreciating Mr. Barber?s
motives, that it was desirable for all parties that
it should be referred to the Master. This was
assented to, and it occupied the Master more than
a year before he made his official report to the
publication of the first edition, actually ignorant of the whole
case, its merits or its demerits, except from hearsay. I know
that the majority have read this pamphlet, and it has been re-
ported to me, I cannot say with what truth, that they have
acknowledged its force with expressions of regret that they had
not sooner been more informed of the bearing of the evidence :
whether I am rightly informed on this point or not, it is certain
that they have not, in any way, offered a reply or a contradic-
tion. I have adverted to this remarkable silence in a former
note, but the remark will bear repetition.


Court! The general rule of Court on which this
practice is founded, only exacts information re-
specting the interval that may have elapsed since
the last certificate. In Mr. Barber?s case, the rule
or order of reference was, contrary to the usual
practice, and upon the special demand of the Law
Society, altered by the Master, and so worded as
to allow of the inquiry being extended to all his
professional career. This was protested against
in the Master?s office by Mr. Barber?s solicitor,
and exception was taken to it by his counsel in
argument on the report; but the protest was dis-
regarded, and the exception overruled, on the
ground that it was competent to the Court, irre-
spective of the rule of Court, to inform itself of
the fitness of its officers. Such a dictum is pre-
cisely one of that class which it is impossible for
a lawyer to deny, and equally difficult for any
man, not a lawyer, to apply to the profession of
an attorney. An attorney is, undoubtedly, an
? officer of the Court,? but not (in modern times)
in that sense in which the ushers and doorkeepers
are its officers. A jurisdiction, however, is still
asserted over them derived from this theory and
ancient practice, by virtue of which jurisdic-
tion the Master (himself an officer of the Court)
was held to he right in prosecuting inquiry into
all Mr. Barber?s professional life. We will not
complicate the story by following out this extended
inquiry, now that it is confessed by the judgment
that it ended in nothing; nor should we even
allude to it, were it not necessary to make Mr.
Barber?s present position intelligible. In the
course of the inquiry copies of certain very
important documents, including the confessions
of Bletcher and Sanders, were submitted to
the Master; the object being, of course, to
show that the Royal pardon of Mr. Barber rested


on good and sufficient grounds. As we under-
stand the facts, and we shall be too glad to find
them contradicted, not by mere denial but by
proof, these copies were compared by the solicitor
of the Law Society with the originals in the pos-
session of Mr. Barber?s solicitor, and marked by
him ? examined,? in the usual way; hut as re-
specting the original ? confessions,? the Society?s
solicitor was referred to the Home Office. It
appears from a letter of Mr. Waddington to Mr.
Stevenson, dated the 21st March, 1850, that
those confessions were then still at the Home
Office, and that no application to examine them
had ever been made on the part of the Incor-
porated Law Society .* Yet, in Sir Frederick
Thesiger?s argument against Mr. Barber?s appli-
cation, we find the following remark authorised,
as we are hound to assume, by the instructions of
the Law Society :
? Inquiry had been anxiously made as to what
had become of the supposed confessions of Joshua
Fletcher and William Sanders, made in the year
1844; what was done with them , how they were
procured, and how they were used ; and no satis-
factory answer has been given! !!?
This is obviously beyond comment, unless an
explanation can be given; though what explana-
* The following is a copy of Mr. Waddington?s letter :
?Whitehall, March 21, 1850.
? Sir, ?I am directed by Secretary Sir George Grey to
acquaint you, in reply to your letters of the Bth and 20th
instant, that the confessions of Fletcher, in reference to Mr.
Barber, ai?e still at the Home Office, and probably that of San-
ders also, though the latter has been mislaid, and cannot for the
moment be found. No application has been made by the
Incorporated Law Society with reference to these documents.

tion can be given is equally beyond our power to
conceive. But this is not all: the other copies
marked ? examined,? by the Society?s attorney,
were produced before the Master, and received by
him in evidence. Hence it was naturally assumed
that the same documents would be received with-
out objection when the application was argued on
the Master?s Report; yet, incredible as it may
sound in a case not of pecuniary litigation, but
involving the higher object of an inquiry into pro-
fessional fitness and character, and when that
inquiry professed to be instituted, not from per-
sonal hostility but from a sense of public justice,
the technical objection was taken, that these
documents were not proved: and that though
already used as evidence in the Master?s office by
consent, proof had not been waived by the for-
mality of admission and consent in writing; and
thus all the expurgatory evidence on which the
Royal pardon had been granted, was dexterously
shut out from the consideration of the Court;
though, so far as these documents exhibited
Mr. Barber?s conduct, subsequently to his omis-
sion to take out his certificate, it cannot be con-
tended that they were not evidence.*
It is therefore that we commenced with saying
that the judgment proceeded on an erroneous
impression of the facts.
Other writers, and men, too, of high forensic
distinction, have expressed themselves in terms of
indignation on these circumstances, such as we
will not imitate or quote. In truth we dare not
express the feelings which have been excited; but
when a very limited body of gentlemen publicly
avows its fullest confidence in the Incorporated
Law Society in reference to this case, it would

have been but fair in that body to investigate to
the bottom the course pursued by the metro-
politan body, and the motive for it, before such a
vote of confidence was put on record.
Some opinion of the probable result of such an
inquiry may be formed from the extract from a
published letter addressed by Mr. Barber s soli-
citor to the Editor of the Legal Observer:
?As the attorney for Mr. Barber, I attended every meeting
before the Master, and conducted the whole of Mr. Barbers
case; and, after nearly forty years? experience in the profession,
accustomed to legal investigations of every class and character,
I am constrained to declare that I cannot call to mind an in-
stance in which I have had to complain of so much unfairness
and bad faith as I experienced at the hands of Mr. Barber s
opponents, in the recent inquiry. They called upon him to
answer matters, the papers relating to which they knew he had
been stripped of by his prosecutors. They procrastinated the
investigation by every device they could employ, and encumbered
and confused it by a mass of frivolous and irrelevant matters.
The manager of the inquiry was entrusted with documents upon
his express undertaking that Mr. Barber and I should also be
allowed to inspect them, and yet this was afterwards denied us.
They commenced, and throughout conducted, the inquiry under
an express repudiation of any imputation of guilty knowledge
in Mr. Barber ; declaring that they proposed to inquire into the
question of supposed professional negligence merely! upon
which the Master observed, ?No; it can?t be expected that I
am to try a question of felony.? Relying upon this most dis-
tinct avowal and understanding, and upon the honour and good
faith of a Society to which I had been accustomed to look as
the protector of the profession and not as the oppressor of its
members, I was led to consent to the admission of unauthen-
ticated documentary evidence which I should otherwise have
been bound to resist. It was upon this very unauthenticated
documentary evidence, which, under the disavowal of any im-
putation of guilt, I was entrapped into the admission of, that
the case, such as it was, of the Society solely rested, and, when
before the Court, the counsel of the Society suddenly turned
round and put Mr. Barber again on his trial for felony ; calling
upon him to prove his innocence, and show that her Majesty
had not erroneously exercised the royal prerogative, taking care
to shut out from the consideration of the Court the very
evidence upon which the pardon was granted, and which they


had expressly recognised before the Master. All this, and
much more, they crowned by instructing their counsel to make
a statement to the Court of Queen?s Bench, which I cannot but
designate as a positive fabrication.?
Our judges are bound to decide according to
evidence. In this case, one half of the evidence
was kept hack, and the other half was received on
the Master?s Report. We apprehend that quite
enough has been shown in the preceding pages, to
satisfy any unprejudiced mind, that even on the
admitted facts of the case, guilt was morally
impossible; still, under such circumstances , it
cannot excite surprise that the judgment was
unfavourable. One great advantage, however,
has been gained by Mr. Barber. He is relieved,
in his next application, from all the- vexatious
imputations of malpractice so unjustly heaped
upon him; and he has now to fight the battle on
the charge of forgery, and on that alone ?to fight
it, too, with his evidence in that technical com-
pleteness, that even his enemies cannot challenge
it.* It is not the least singular part of this very
singular episode to the trial, that while the prose-
cutors abandoned the cases of Burchard and Hunt
as hopeless of conviction, and were actually
defeated upon Stewart?s case, they have all been
ingeniously re-opened to aid the ungracious op-
position to Mr. Barber. This is not intelligible.
Whatever may be the limited operation of the
Royal pardon ?and it may well be doubted if
sound doctrine has not been carried too far on
that point?it admits of no question that a verdict
of Not Guilty is complete exculpation. We have
no such verdict as ?not proven? in our law,
neither in theory nor practice. In all these three
*He bas not been allowed to fight it. The rule nisi being

cases, Mr. Barber is to be held absolutely innocent,
and ? innocent ? means that he was acquitted of
fraudulent intention. That he uttered the forged
wills is not disputed, but he uttered them profes-
sionally and bond fide , not knowing them to be
forged, and therefore not with any intent to
defraud. Any inference, therefore, that might
have been built upon these three cases, is neces-
sarily and conclusively rebutted by the verdicts.
Hence these cases are only quotable, to sustain
the theory of innocence in the last case of Slack?s,
as we will prove.
The reader will not have forgotten the impor-
tant letter from Tletcher to Mr. Barber of the
20th of July, 1842.* Our argument upon this
letter was, that it was conclusive of Mr. Barber
being the dupe, and not the accomplice, up to that
date ?an argument never alluded to in the judg-
ment?and all the eight other cases, forged and
genuine, had occurred previously to that date.
Hence, that on the evidence for the prosecution
(for this letter was given in evidence on that side),
it was apparent that Mr. Barber had entered upon
Slack?s case with all the conviction of its being
an honest one, that could be derived from the
successful conduct of eight previous cases, pre-
cisely similar, and introduced to his office by the
same party.
This argument, even as it stands, seems conclu-
sive ; but mark how it is strengthened by the
fact, that in the three prior cases of forgery Mr.
Barber actually stands exonerated by a jury; and
exonerated, too, by verdicts (it does not affect the
reasoning that two of them were by consent)
which, by the force of circumstances, admit of no
other construction than this : that he uttered the

forgeries honestly?in the good faith of profes-
sional confidence?precisely as he might have
uttered three forged bank-notes, had they been
received from Fletcher in payment of his costs.
We are, therefore, warranted in saying, that
these previous cases of Stewart?s, Burchard?s, and
Hunt?s, are only fairly to be quoted in his favour;
for?to avail ourselves further of the same illus-
tration, applicable, indeed, to the whole series of
these transactions?suppose that Mr. Barber had
been successively paid his bills of costs in nine
forged ï¿½lO notes by the fraud of Fletcher, and
had paid away eight of them without the detection
of forgery even by the Bank itself, would it be
reasonable in him to suspect that the ninth was
forged? But how much less reasonable would
the suspicion be, if only three of the eight had
actually been forgeries, and all the rest genuine ?
And the same illustration will carry us yet fur-
ther.?Let it be also assumed that he was put on
his trial for uttering each of the four forged bank
notes, all impressions from the same plate (Mr.
Freshfield, at least, will understand the force of this
allusion), and that he was acquitted in the three
first cases, not because his utterance of them was
disputed, but because the honesty with which he
had taken and paid them, in the ordinary course
of professional business, was placed beyond dis-
pute, would it be possible for any jury that clearly
understood the case to convict him on the fourth ?
Or if, under a false conception of the facts, they
did convict, would not the previous acquittals
afford the strongest of all grounds for assuming
the conviction to be wrong ?
But here, even after the conviction is proved to
be wrong by a pardon of which the Court acknow-
ledges the force, the three previous cases?in all
of which, not a pardon, but a verdict , declares
x 2


liis innocence?are pressed, to prove that the
pardon was not warranted, and the conviction
just! ! !
The same illustration affords a very satisfactory
reply to the censure for negligence and want of
caution. Who evinces caution in receiving bank
notes from a wealthy client, from whom, so far as
his knowledge and belief extend, he has never
received a doubtful shilling ? These will forgeries
were, in truth, all impressions from the same
plate; and to those who are accustomed to Bank
prosecutions, the circumstance will seem very
important. In every case the same machinery
was used; the confession of Mrs. Dorey, published
immediately after the trial, though made before,
gives full explanation of the whole system adopted
by Eletcher. She also was, in a great measure, his
dupe, but more in his confidence that any other
of his accomplices. By her account, Eletcher,
who had recently lost his wife, offered her mar-
riage; and there is abundant reason to believe
that this offer was induced by the consciousness
of being entirely in her power. It will be re-
membered that she personated Miss Burchard.
In her confession, which was clearly made in
no friendly spirit to Mr. Barber, she unwittingly
furnishes the strongest collateral confirmation of
the integrity of his case, for she admits that she
went to his office to he introduced to him in dis-
guise; and that, too, so artfully assumed, that
she several times passed ITetcher, who was wait-
ing for her in the street (to introduce her to Mr.
Barber as Miss Burchard) without his recognising
her ! This important fact, we may observe in
passing, was known to Mr. Freshfield before the
trial. Possiblv it was for this reason that this
ï¿½/
case was abandoned. But ought not the case of
Slack?s to have been abandoned, too, for the same


reason ? If Mr. Barber was thus artfully imposed
upon in the one case, was it not a fair presump-
tion that he was equally deluded in the other ? It
was too bad to shut him out from the evidence of
.Fletcher and his accomplices, when here it was
apparent, on the confession of the only accomplice
at that time obtained, how strongly their evidence
would have sustained Mr. Barber?s defence.
We have at last, however, the confession of all
the confederates, and they concur in showing that
every case bore exactly the same complexion. Of
course, there were variations of circumstance,
but there was the same process of forging wills,
forging affidavits of explanation, forging certifi-
cates, and personating claimants; the confede-
rates in all being the same: but Fletcher took
good care to present a new face to Mr. Barber as
the claimant in each transaction. And it is a
curious feature in the case, that, as there was
no evidence whatever of any pecuniary advan-
tage derived by Mr. Barber ultra his legitimate
costs, so there is not a tittle of evidence that he
knew, or on any occasion saw, or met any of
Fletcher?s accomplices (and he has made affidavit
that he never did), except in their disguise and in
their assumed characters. Will anybody believe
it possible that in felonious transactions extend-
ing over four years, all the inquisitorial dexterity
and all the resources of the Bank should have
failed in producing some slight evidence of ac-
quaintance and intercourse between Mr. Barber
and Fletcher?s accomplices, had Mr. Barber been
privy to their guilty purpose ?*
But we will conclude, for we feel the real and
only danger of the case to be, that, view it in
* This fact, like every other of a favourable character, is
unnoticed in Lord Campbell?s judgment.


what light we may, there is such a mass and such
a variety of facts and arguments ?all irresistibly
tending to the same conclusion of perfect inno-
cence ?and such a volume of absurdity and
inconsistency to he exposed on the hypothesis
either of guilt or culpable negligence, that there
is more hazard of bewildering the reader, and
thus diverting his attention from the merits, than
in failing to convince him upon the merits. We
are only too thankful that the responsibility does
not rest upon us to explain, either to Parliament
or the public, how it has happened that an inno-
cent man, a respectable member of an honourable
profession, should have been indicted in the face
of facts in the possession of the prosecutors, which
rendered his guilt morally impossible; should
have been put upon his trial in a form that
almost precluded the possibility of proving his
innocence; should have been transported, as in
former days he would have been hanged , though
innocent; should have been subjected, by special
instructions, to indignity and punishment beyond
the vilest felons ; should have been debarred the
relief which medical men prescribed for the safety
of his life ; should have had the letters of himself
and of officials in his behalf suppressed, even
when addressed to the Pirst Minister of State;
should, after pardon, have been turned out in
actual nudity and destitution , to make his way
unaided and alone through a hundred miles of
wilderness and flood; and finally, when his case had
been thoroughly investigated and his innocence
formally acknowledged by men of every rank and
station?by the wretched criminals with whom
he was associated ?by the superintendents, ma-
gistrates, and chaplains?by the very felons who
deceived him ?by naval and military officers
accustomed to penal settlements ?by the chief


justice, judges, and bar of Sydney?by the Law
Society of that city, after ten days? investigation;
men equal in honour and ability, and far more
conversant with such inquiries than their profes-
sional brethren at home?by the chief justice,
judges, and bar of Madras?by the Marquis of
Normanby at Paris?by Sir George Grey at
Whitehall?by the jury which convicted him?
and by all the public press, and nine-tenths of
the profession;?when his innocence had been
thus sifted and acknowledged, that one so unfor-
tunate, so crushed, yet so noble in his suffering,
should have been received by a section of the
solicitors infinitesimally small in number, though
large in influence, with distrust instead of cor-
diality?with hostility instead of sympathy?with
persecution instead of aid?with undissembled
eagerness to tread him into dust, instead of
generous pity and frank support in his arduous
effort to retrieve the ruin brought on him by
unjust accusation!
This explanation must be given, for assuredly
it will be demanded. The Home Minister, by
his just decision and prompt response to the
appeal of humanity, worthy of his high station
and yet more exalted character, has laid a found-
ation for it. Many members of both Houses,
well known in every cause of benevolence, are
prepared with full possession of the facts. We
envy not those with whom it will rest to solve
this complication of mysteries.
We cannot lay down the pen without adding
that the claims of Mr. Barber to the justice as
well as the commiseration of the public are not
to be disregarded. The liberal subscriptions at
Sydney and Madras only sufficed to land him in
England, penniless, and friendless, and profes-
sionless. The unrelenting opposition to his re-


? Fiat justitia, mat ccelum.?
commencing business has subjected him to end-
less liability, for it lias been conducted, as we are
informed, at an expense of nearly a thousand
pounds, though professional talent of the highest
order has been kindly and gratuitously devoted
to his service. He lost his books, his papers, his
clients, and his property, in the destructive con-
fusion that followed on his apprehension; he has
long been dependent on the bounty of a few kind
acquaintances, though latterly enabled to earn a
pittance as a clerk. His title to compensation
from the public purse, could money compensate
for the loss he has sustained, is good; but in
these parsimonious days it will long be deferred,
if not evaded. It is right to add, that he is no
party to this appeal; he does not even know of
it, nor has he hinted it. He has not been con-
sulted on a word that has been written through-
out these pages. This review of his case has
been dictated solely by the motives explained in
the prefatory advertisement, and rests altogether
on the evidence before the world.
