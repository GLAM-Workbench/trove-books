MR. CHARLES BDOUIN
particularly requests his particular
friends to take particular notice of the particu-
larly excellent quality of the particular refresh-
ments supplied at the Imperial Hotel. He
would particularly invite attention to
ticular variety of Wines, of most particular vint-
ages, particularly selected by him on account of
their particular superiority. It would be par-
ticularly superfluous to particularise the par-
ticulars of his Spirits; and as for .his particular
Ales, both English and Colonial, they particularly
defy competition. A particular feature amongst
other particulars is the particular completeness
of tbe domestic arrangements; and a particu-
larly pleasant evening may be whiled away in a
particularly musical and vocal manner, the
proprietor being particularly anxious to supply
the requirements of his particular patrons with
two particularly excellent Pianofortes, which he
particularly places at their disposal. In
particularising particular advantages offered by
the

THE Patentee having completed

Q. A S REFLECTORS
Great brilliancy, combined with softness of
light and beauty of appearance, has been ob-
tained in the manufacture of rny REFLECTORS
by the use of enamel glass.
All gaseous matter being carefully extracted
in the manufacture o.f the enamel, renders it
thoroughly impervious to atmospheric or other
action ; consequently a durability is obtained
which has not been equalled by any reflecting
power ever yet discovered.
