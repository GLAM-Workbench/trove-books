ON THE STUDY OF MODERN LANGUAGES,
AND ESPECIALLY OF FRENCH.
It is almost a truism to say that the study of languages, considered
in its results, is, on the whole, a failure ; so much so, that a person
speaking a foreign language with any degree of fluency, without
having resided abroad, may be considered as a prodigy. It is
consequently inferred that, whatever means will be resorted to to
attain fluency in a foreign language, it would be indulging a vain
hope to expect anything but a smattering altogether insufficient
for colloquial purposes. Is this a necessary consequence of the
experience of so many disappointed students ? Far from agreeing
with this verdict, I may confidently affirm that fluency can be
attained in a comparatively short time, without considerable
efforts ; nay, I may say that to the habit of resorting to efforts of
the mind and memory must be attributed our universal, if not
necessary, failure in the study of languages. If the attainment of
fluency requires so little effort, if the efficient means are within
the reach of very ordinary capacities, how comes it that such
means are universally neglected ? The reason is obvious ; we
never think of acquiring fluency ; we postpone its acquisition to
the end of our studies, supposing it will necessarily spring out of
the enormous burden with which our mental memory is to be
overwhelmed, while the storing of our verbal memory is entirely
neglected.
The main point in the acquisition of fluency is not to go to a
second word ?to a second sentence ?before the former word or
sentence be as easy to handle as if it were in our native language;
and not to undertake a new lesson unless we have actually a
perfect command over all that is past. This requirement only
makes the work easier for the memory, for by the time the vocal
organ has a perfect command over the sentence, the work of the


memory is done. However, any teacher who attempted this
practice knows how reluctant students are to it at first. The
method to be used, the choice and arrangement of materials, are
no unimportant matter; but by far the greatest amount of either
success or failure derived from methods must be accounted for by
the greater or less amount of useful materials? ie ., common words
and constructions, with which, through methods, we store per-
manently our verbal memory. Hence we are led to examine
what are, in that respect, the facilities afforded by the different
methods in use.
The most common, if not the most popular road to linguistry,
is grammar and vocabularies. Is a theoretical knowledge of
grammatical facts necessary for the practical knowledge of a
language ? Assuredly not; or else the power of speech would
be limited to a very small fraction of the habitable globe. But,
perhaps, if it is not necessary, it might lessen to a great extent
the time to be devoted to practice. The latter point requires a
more careful investigation than the former. Can a student have a
clear and permanent knowledge of a rule before being made
familiar with a greater or less number of its applications?that is,
in such a manner as to be able to originate examples of this rule
without hardly thinking of the rule itself? I had a great many
occasions of making such experiments, and I mostly found that
the best pupils trained in grammar for years, either by myself or
other teachers, only kept a confused? ie, incomplete and false,
idea of rules, when they could not apply them as readily as a
native w?ould. This only shows that theory, if not supported by
practice, falls to pieces. But, then comes the question?will the
pupil remember the rule if, directly after it has been explained to
him, he applies it a sufficient number of times? If the examples
of the rule are, and remain for him, as familiar as if they were in
his own language, and are numerous in proportion with the
difficulty experienced in the assimilation of the rule, he will,
sometimes. If the rule be of a complicate character, it would
require such an amount of time and labour that, should there be
a number of such rules, as is the case, he would never see the
end of his task. Besides, it would be absolutely necessary to
have and keep a perfect mastery of numerous examples, which is
hardly possible, considering the large proportion of time spent ?
I should say wasted ?in writing, hesitating, blundering, correcting,
and turning the leaves of dictionaries and grammars. There is
also a fatal objection when, in a class, the rule being explained
and learned at the same time as the examples are mastered,
pupils having a good memory would be stopped by those having
a bad one.
But let us suppose for a moment that all the difficulties have
been conquered, and that a pupil is able to recite and explain, at
a moment?s notice, any rule to be found in a common-sized


grammar, the capital point, for those who wish to attain fluency,
is to know whether this theoretical knowledge will be of any use
for practical purposes. Anyone who has been teaching a language
knows that a rule, however simple, may be explained any number
of times to a pupil, and yet he will break it, even although he
remembers and understands it thoroughly. If such simple rules
as the one that prohibits the use of the present participle after any
French preposition except en be powerless for practice, what must it
be for complicate and shadowy rules such as those concerning the
use of the subjunctive? It is true that good pupils, after years of
grammatical study, will not generally fall into gross blunders ; but
it is only when their eyes and ears have become pretty well
accustomed to the correct expression ; it is imitation ?not theory
?that leads them. As a rule, however, the number of mistakes
they are warranted against is small, and there is no sign of fluency.
A fact that will show how little relation theory has to practice is
the numerous blunders given as rules by able men, who could
never have made the mistakes they taught. It is very common
also for students to be satisfied with rules which they do not
understand. How many among the students who have been
using this worst of the worst of all grammars,De Fivas? Grammar,?
have noticed that the example, ?// sefie davantage a ses bnnieres ,?
which is supposed to illustrate the rule 602, has nothing to do
with it?
I have endeavoured to show how little we can expect from gram-
matical training for the attainmentof fluency; but grammar teaching,
as far as French is concerned, is less than powerless?it is impossible;
for there is no such a thing as a grammar for the use of English-
speaking people. Whoever has compared French grammars
published in France with the innumerable compilations supposed
to be made for English people, will admit that, except the language
in which they are written, they differ little, if at all, from them,
with this distinctive feature, however, that standard modern French
grammarians seem to be unknown to Anglo-French compilers.
It is obvious that, in a grammar made for English people, the
choice of the materials, their arrangement, the point of view in
which they are exposed, should be totally different. Besides
definitions and other notions of general grammar which are
ridiculous in a work intended for foreigners, we find especially
rules whose aim is to correct spelling and other mistakes, which
could not be made if the student had learnt his language through
his eyes as soon as through his ears; but such mistakes are
unknown to foreigners who learn with a master. We find also
mentioned in grammars a nomenclature of incorrect expressions to
be guarded against; but a foreigner who has an educated French-
man to teach him has no idea of making mistakes which he never
heard. Sometimes there are two ways of expressing an idea, or
two genders for a noun, one of which is superseding the other:


such conflicting usages may be a cause of either mistake or doubt,,
and it is not useless in a grammar intended for natives to settle
the question.
A foreigner, who is properly trained, should never hear what is
condemned or getting into disuse, and so should not need rules
about it. What can be more absurd, for instance, than telling an
Englishman that the plural of enfant should not be enfans, or else
that it must be so, according to some grammarians ? A skilful
teacher simplifies the work, not for himself indeed, but for his
pupil, by never letting him see the irregular plural. When the
training is over, if the student happens to meet a form different
from the one he was broken to, he will simply conclude that there
are two allowed. So much for what is useless in Anglo-French
grammars.
But grammar, for a native, is simply a polishing, a corrective
instrument, as it were ; while for foreigners it should be an intro-
duction to the language. In a grammar intended for natives, we
must expect to find, chiefly, what is unknown to the majority of
people ; while, in an Anglo-French grammar, we should find only
what every Frenchman knows. The tact, not the learning of the
grammarian, is to be displayed in the choice of the materials,
while an inexhaustible patience, a long experience enlightened by
an extensive and thorough knowledge of the language as to its
structure, will be his only safe guides in the interpretation and
arrangement of those materials. So it happens that, in Anglo-
French grammars, while obsolete peculiarities are spread in
profusion, the most essential principles are only conspicuous by
their absence. They will all tell us that the plural of coucou is
coucous, or that pou makes poux; but not a single one thinks of
telling us why we must not translate ?it is better? by ce vant
mieux , but by cela vant mieux , and when ? it? must be translated
by cela. None will tell us why we cannot say jfe vans lui envoie,
but Je vans envoie a lui , although we say Je envoie un livre.,
following in this a very common and easy rule. The reason why
all French grammars intended for French people mention the
first rule, and not generally the last two, should induce Anglo-
French grammarians to do the reverse ; but then they would be
grammarians, while we have only compilers. The patience of
students ought to be admired when they are learning in Havet,
page 99, the plural of aval, cal , cantal , narval , nopal , and serval.
People who delude themselves with the idea that they are
learning grammar, while they are puzzling their brains with a
thousand trifles which they will never know, are very much like
the one who, wishing to learn the vocabulary of a language, would
confine himself to an obsolete portion of it?to the vocabulary of
clock-making, for instance.
We have so far considered grammar teaching as a powerless
instrument for the acquisition of linguistry; we have seen that it


iis impossible, as far as French is concerned, through our having
? only pretences of Anglo-French grammars : but when learning
French grammar we do worse than waste our time and labour,
we store our minds with erroneous ideas of the language. As
stated before, the point of view in which grammatical facts are
exposed to foreigners ought to be totally different from the one
adopted for natives. Often a grammarian, aware that his readers
are, practically, acquainted with a rule beyond the possibility of a
mistake, will only allude to it without being very particular as to
the exactness of his statements, which, followed literally, are
simply gross mistakes. An example or two will illustrate what
may at first appear a paradox. Brachet?s Grammar has been
lately translated and adapted (or supposed to be so) for the use
of English people, by Masson, an able man, judging from his
articles in the Educational Review of the French Language; but,
unhappily, like many others, an able man in everything except
in what ought to be his speciality. We find, No. 284, ?The
final s of the second person singular of the imperative is expressed
in the first conjugation, when the imperative is placed before a
word beginning with a vowel, such as yor en .? Any foreigner
will conclude that y and en are only two examples given at random
of any word beginning with a vowel. It is not in the least what
Brachet means. If Brachet had been speaking to foreigners, or
if Masson had not been one of the imitatorum servant pecus, we
should read that when the second person singular of the imperative
is immediately followed by the pronoun en , or the particle y, if
the verb does not end with an s, this letter is added. Another
instance could be found in Littre?s Dictionary, when he says that
there is no material difference between quand and lorsque. To
an Englishman, he would have said that there is an enormous
difference. There are cases when it is impossible for a Frenchman
to take the one for the other, while an Englishman will have no
objection in doing so. It would have been idle for Littre,
speaking to French people, to mention the case.
It might be urged that a teacher who explains rules properly
should prevent a misunderstanding?should complete the gram-
marian ; but what can he do when the rules are false in every
point of view, or have no sense at all ? If correct and logical
rules are so tedious, so puzzling sometimes, what will it be with
? contradictory and fanciful rules, which are nothing but the dreams
of the most ignorant class of people ? Any page of nine out of
ten Anglo-French grammars can give an illustration of this
unflattering statement. Is there one grammar correct out of ten?
Not even that; but this proportion will represent the class of earnest
men who thought of doing something tolerable. Unfortunately,
besides the defects which render other grammars unfit for English
people, they are incorrect also. The reason, as stated by an
-authority in the matter, is that sound, correct grammar, has


not known yet how to make itself popular; and Anglo-French'
grammarians, even the conscientious ones, found it more simple to
borrow from unpretending but worthless grammars. Many parts
of grammar are, by their very nature, extremely complicate and
shadowy; and it is principally to the attempt at simplifying what
does not admit of simplification, that the numerous errors of
popular grammarians must be attributed. Some illustrations will-
show how there is not a single Anglo-French grammarian to be
relied upon, in any degree. Let us take one of the best ?Havet,
for instance ; when speaking of the use of son and leur after chacun,
he treats the question in the same way as nearly all grammarians?
i.e., all popular grammarians have done ?by giving a mechanical,
fanciful, and false rule, contradicted incessantly by the best
writers. What prevented him, however, from consulting Jullien,
published in 1849, and quoted by Littre in his famous dictionary?
What will any one, knowing soever little French, say of Gasc, the
most judicious of Anglo-French grammarians, when he reads in
his grammar that agreable governs de ?
An Anglo-French Grammar would by no means be an easy work
to make; but what would it be to learn? Have students ever
considered how many rules would be required to explain, in all
its particulars, the whole structure of a language ? A hundred
thousand rules would be far below the number known practically
by a person of an ordinary education. It must be remembered
that in grammars, as they exist, there is hardly any attempt to
describe in its particulars the structure of a language; besides a few
generalities, we only find useful remarks intended for people who
are practically acquainted with the bulk of its structure. Unless
we have an extraordinary aptitude for gramrnar, to say the least?
if grammar be the only road to linguistry?we must confine
ourselves to our native language.
So far we have supposed an Anglo-French Grammar to be
within the bounds of possibility: it remains to show how, to a
great extent, it is an absolute impossibility. It is easy to say that
the partitive article is used when some or any is either expressed
or understood; but how often two points of view are allowed !.
How is a student to know which point of view custom has
adopted in each case ? It is easy to say that it must not be
translated by ce, but by il, elle , &c., when referring to a noun ; but
how is a student to know that in the translation of ? I shall buy a
toy. ?What will it be?? it is considered by French people not
as referring to the noun toy, but to the thing itself in a vague
manner ? Whoever has attempted to solve difficulties of this kind,
knows how frequently they occur.
If the study of grammar is so arduous, is impossible even ?if
we consider grammar as the complete expression of the rules of
language?happily, the acquisition of languages themselves is
within the reach of the meanest capacity. I will not be accused


of using an empty word when saying that practice?not theory?
is the natural way to the acquisition of languages. If practice
be unmethodical, if the student be under the influence of his
native language while learning a foreign one, theory may
occasionally be a help, a corrective ; but it remains true that, for
the acquisition of languages, a well directed practice is the only
safe way.
Practice may be divided into two kinds ?viz., conversation and
translation. For natives, the only possible and natural way is
conversation. For those who learn a foreign language, it seems
more natural to learn languages through their own?that is, by
translations. It must be remarked here that I mean by natural
way the one which, examined in its process, advantages, and
drawbacks, seems to be the best adapted to the tendency of
learners. What some theorizers call natural should be more
properly termed injudicious. Let those who are satisfied with
the well-sounding motto, ? learn a foreign language as you
learned your mother tongue,? attend the performances called
conversation classes, in which their talkative power is kept up to
the end of the course, but never farther. Before accepting an
opinion on the matter, let us examine the impression produced
by conversation, both on a child and on an adult. When a child
hears ?What o?clock is it? ? what is going on in his mind ? He
will not cut the sentence to pieces ; he gives no special meaning
to ?clock;? he has not the least tendency to displace ?clock,? and
use it in a wrong acceptation or a construction of his own. The
consequence is, make him speak as soon as you can, false steps,
bad habits, are not to be feared. What will happen with a
Frenchman learning English ? He will directly say : ? What =
quelle o?clock = heure is est it ill' 1 Therefore that Frenchman
should not be allowed to speak before he has learned through
other examples that what is not necessarily quelle , that o'clock has
nothing to do with heure , and that it is not always il. If you let
him speak, he will not be understood, a great portion of his time
will be wasted, and he will hinder his own progress considerably.
To generalize the case, I will say that, when learning a foreign
language, it is unnatural, injudicious, to originate sentences
before having mastered a stock of correct materials sufficient
to enable us to know the value of the words we employ;
and this is impossible in conversation. It is not considered
either that a foreigner, giving to his study a time extremely
limited, must distribute his time and labour so as to effect the
greatest possible saving. Any time given to practice beyond what
is necessary to acquire and keep a perfect command over words
and constructions is wasted. Foreigners encounter many diffi-
culties peculiar to themselves, which are no obstacle for natives ;
it is upon those difficulties they should bestow the savings effected
out of what is comparatively easy. There is a considerable


amount of constructions the acquisitions of which do not in any-
way promote fluency, while they hinder our mastering other
constructions, by being a cause of confusion. A systematic
exclusion of such constructions is more than a saving, and this is
impossible in conversation. The order in which difficulties
are presented is not indifferent, and order is incompatible with
conversation. In spite of its drawbacks, conversation is, on the
whole, an effective way of learning languages ; it has the special
advantage, when abroad, of making deeper impressions than
translation would ; learning being made less tedious through the
circumstances connected with it, we are also better disposed to
receive those impressions The facility with which we acquire
languages abroad, however, has been greatly exaggerated. For
many, some magical influence is supposed to result from breathing
a foreign air and listening to the conversation of foreigners, while
a very small minority are able to speak with a tolerable fluency
after a year?s sojourn abroad. It is not uncommon to see people
who have resided ten years and more abroad, and hardly know
the names of coins. Why is conversation effective abroad, and
not with a master ? For many reasons. Impressions in a fictitious
conversation are weaker, and the proportion of time devoted to
conversation abroad is immensely greater. We must consider
that, in a class of twenty boys who take two hours? lessons a week,
supposing that the master himself never speaks, each boy speaks
four hours a year. Abroad, the same boys would have spoken
two thousand hours perhaps. The progress . with a master is
lessened in a greater proportion still, because the impressions
being weak, are soon effaced, and to make it worse, ample
time is given to lose those impressions in proportion as they
are produced. Teaching by conversation would be effective
if the lessons could be accumulated at the rate of several
hours a day. Pupils who have been learning a language for
years through grammars and translations, seeing that they are
unable to speak, fancy that, by attending a conversation class,
they will be more successful; they cannot speak unless they try,
they say. They do not suspect that it is quite possible to learn
to converse with a perfect fluency and accuracy without ever
conversing; and that it is quite possible also to converse for
years without being able to converse at all when the course is
over. Conversation, with a master, is nothing but a slow compo-
sition, made up mostly from freshly perused materials. The pupil,
however, likes it very much; it is a conversation, it is not rote
learning, and the results are immediate. Three days afterwards,
if the master is not afraid of being tedious, he will have the same
conversation carried on, besides a new one. Some teachers go so
far as to make a dictation of those same materials a week after;
but if they care for number, it is very unwise; pupils do not like
to be annoyed with what is supposed to be known. What remains


of what has been talked after six months ? If a good luck has not
brought again the same expressions often enough, nothing at all.
As for the words and expressions that have come again at intervals
of a week, they remain as a confused recollection in a mangled
state, and are worse than useless for colloquial purposes. But
conversation goes on with an increasing interest on new topics, of
course, mainly out of freshly perused materials; as for the former
words to be used sometimes, as they are entirely forgotten, they
appear to be new, and are given by the master to be learnt and
forgotten over again. Grammatical difficulties are never con-
quered, although connected with very common words, because
the expressions in which rules are applied only leave a fugitive
impression. It is not till it is too late that pupils perceive
the fallacy of their performances. The drawbacks attending
teaching by conversation would be of little importance if
the lessons were accumulated; then the second impression
would strengthen the first one instead of succeeding it, and
vanishing in its turn; an expression would either complete or
correct the idea we have formed of another, instead of leaving
two disconnected and fugitive impressions. We may thus learn a
good many words, and so enable ourselves to read ; but construc-
tions are far more difficult to master than disconnected words are
to recollect. Our failure in the attainment of fluency must not be
attributed to our learning through conversation or otherwise, nor
our numerous mistakes in written composition to an insufficient
knowledge of rules : the whole secret is, that what we learn is
either partially or entirely forgotten; we never know a lesson so
well as when we have just learnt it, while it should be the reverse-
It is not considered, either, that mere recollections are as useless
for conversation as no knowledge at all. Even abroad we often
forget, over and over again, the same expressions, but not all.
When, we have mastered a pretty good stock, the forgotten expres-
sions are more easily added to it, because they can then attract
our undivided attention. Both at home and abroad we have a.
total disregard for the weakness of our memory; but abroad this
neglect can, to a great extent, be compensated for, while it
annihilates our progress at home.
If fluency cannot be attained through conversation, so long as
we cannot give to it a far greater amount of time than the
generality of people can spare, will learning through translation be
more effective ? Can we acquire fluency through translation, if
we can spare say six hours a week, a greater or less portion being
with a master, for two years ? Speaking from experience, I may
say that it can easily be done ; and also that, in spite of all
warnings, it will rarely be so. We have seen that the only
advantage conversation abroad has over translation is, that it
produces more vivid impressions, and lessens the dryness of
learning, thus increasing our mental power. Such is not the case


with fictitious conversation. Another immense advantage that
attends conversation abroad is time. If through translation we
can easily, though rarely, obtain as good results in five hundred
hours as through conversation abroad in five hundred days, and
that in spite of the advantages which conversation abroad has
over translation, translation must have, in some respects, a great
superiority. Where this superiority lies, and why it is so seldom
appreciable in its results, is what we are going to examine.
No argument is necessary to show that, for an Englishman,
nothing but poor results can be expected from translation into
English. After the perusal of a book, nothing will remain but the
recollection of a good many unconnected words ; few words will
be mastered permanently. One or two expressions often met
with in an author may also leave a lasting impression. As for
?constructions, which are the main point in fluency, the student will
only retain confused ideas of them. Such a student, able to
translate, after a preparation, a piece of French into English,
will not recognize words of this same piece when found in other
sentences. Is translation into English necessarily an ineffective
way of learning languages? No more than conversation, if, as
in conversation at home, some attending circumstances did not
destroy our progress. Our failure in learning through translation
into English must be attributed also, and to a greater extent still,
to the impressions being too weak and too far distant to strengthen
each other. Accumulate your lessons in proportion to the weak-
ness of the impressions produced, and you shall obtain results. If
what you translate be skilfully arranged, if the range of constructions
be very limited, if what may be an obstacle rather than a help be
discarded, if the examples of constructions be numerous in exact
proportion with the difficulties they present, if your pronunciation
be corrected, and if you give to this practice sixteen hours a day,
you shall speak fluently and correctly after two months- ?that is
about eight hundred hours. But if you scatter your eight hundred
hours over four years ?if, instead of confining yourself to the range
of constructions used by a child twelve years old, you choose the
? best authors,? as they are termed, scattering your attention over
ten times as many constructions as the best educated people are
using in conversation ?if you do not eliminate what can only
hinder your progress, you may decuple your eight hundred hours
without ever being able to speak.
Learning through translation into English, however, is only
possible in theory, for it cannot be expected that the mind will
keep its full strength for two months at the rate of sixteen hours
a day; but this supposition is only used to point out the weak
point ?I should say the practical impossibility of the system.
An unquestionably more efficient way of learning languages
is translation into a foreign language. More attention being
bestowed upon words and constructions, the impressions produced


are deeper. It may be urged that, if the impressions are deeper,
the repetitions are not so frequent, as the quantity of translation
gone over is less. The results, however, show that we thus effect
a greater economy of time and labour; still, most students who
have written exercises, and translated orally into a foreign language
for years, are very deficient in written translation, and all are
equally unable to speak. The only superiority such students show
over those who have only, or chiefly, translated into English, or
attended conversation lessons, is that their recollections are more
numerous, and are nearer to what may be said to be remembered.
But as for a firm command over constructions, there is none. The
cause of their failure, whatever it be, is so fatal, that, if they do
not accumulate their lessons to an extent which is hardly possible,
they may learn?and some do ?for a lifetime, without attaining
fluency. Some students ?very rare exceptions?may be able to
understand a conversation, they may have mastered a good many
words and expressions which, assembled anyhow, might answer
their purpose in a case of necessity; but they are not in any way
able to converse. If students will take up the work gone over,
and see how fluently they reproduce the very sentences which
were intended to be the foundation of their instruction, they will
see the whole cause of their failure. As it was remarked before,
we never know a lesson so well as when we have just learnt it:
.the reverse should be the case. It will be easily understood that
we cannot originate sentences with as much fluency and accuracy
as we reproduce those learnt, although the same words and
constructions be applied. Then, how can we expect to originate
sentences with any degree of fluency and accuracy, if the very
sentences which were to be the foundation of our instruction can
only be stammered after a certain time has elapsed ? It would
be a mistake to suppose that because we have mastered a
sentence so well as to be able to reproduce it after years, the
constructions and words illustrated in this sentence are at our
command. We may have mastered permanently many examples
of a construction without its being assimilated. No argument,
however, is required to show that, as long as we cannot express
fluently a limited number of examples of a construction, we
cannot possibly express a greater number. It follows, also, that,
of the examples of words and constructions on which we have
bestowed our attention, those only may promote our attainment
?of fluency which, should they have been left aside for years,
could be reproduced without the shadow of an hesitation, at the
sight of their English version. All other examples of words and
constructions that could not stand this test are only a hindrance
to the attainment of fluency.
How shall we master examples to such a standard of perfection
with the greatest economy of time and labour, and under what
other conditions can the words and constructions illustrated by


those examples be at our command whenever wanted ? Such are
the questions that remain to be examined.
It might be imagined that, since a superficial learning requires
so much effort and time, only people endowed with a wonderful
memory can think of attaining to such a standard of perfection.
There can be no greater mistake. One half of the time required
to learn ten thousand French lines superficially, in such a way as
to forget them altogether after a short time has elapsed, is more
than sufficient to know them so well as to be able to reproduce
the French at the sight of the English version, without the
slightest hesitation, should they have been left aside for years.
Not only such a learning requires no extraordinary effort of
memory, but the only obstacle to it is the habit students have of
overtaxing their memory. The only way to train a bad memory
is to require always a good deal less work than it can perform at
a time. Students are often found?adults especially?who can-
not be broken to the system ; who could not be persuaded that, if
a piece requires an effort of memory to-day, in a few days it will
fall to pieces. Such students prove invariably a failure ; and, if
the teacher shows a little firmness, teaching is at once impossible.
An example will illustrate the process.
Let us take a child having the worst memory that can be
imagined, but no will of his own ; how will he undertake his ten
thousand lines ? Let him read half a line of easy French, which
he should read with a correct pronunciation, and as naturally and
quickly as if he were speaking English. So far, his memory has
not been strained in the least. This done, take the French away,
and let him see the corresponding English, asking him to give the
French, and this directly after having read the French in the way
described before. No child, soever dull he may be, will experi-
ence the least difficulty in doing so. While his vocal organ was
being made familiar with the few words he had under his eyes, a
sufficient impression was made on his mind to enable him to
repeat these words from memory directly afterwards, without any-
thing like an effort being required. When he can repeat these
few words from memory with a correct pronunciation, and as
naturally as if it were English, and not before , increase the
difficulty by an imperceptible degree, distract his attention for two
seconds, during which he can re-translate the former half a line,
perfectly known already. After two seconds have elapsed, he
will re-translate his half a line without suspecting that the difficulty
has been increased. Then increase the difficulty by another
imperceptible degree, and distract his attention for four seconds,
during which he will re-translate the former line perfectly known
already, and so on till his half a line has been translated at
intervals ranging from two to forty seconds ?that is, till he has
re-translated in this manner the ten former lines, which had been
learned previously. Then only the last half a line is known well


- enough for his attention being distracted to a greater degree still;
he will undertake the next half a line, which shall have to go through
the same process, while the former half a line, and those mastered
previously, will be used to distract his attention by imperceptible
degrees, thus taking themselves deeper roots in his mind. The
first lessons should not last more than fifteen minutes, but should
take place twice a day. At each sitting it will be found that the
child has still a perfect command over what has been learned
before; but he should re-translate it through every day, or else
this perfect command would vanish.
If a calculation be made, after a month?s time, the child has
thus learned fifty lines. This is far indeed from ten thousand ;
but he is in the way to speedy progress. It must be considered
that the child has been supposed to have an exceptionally bad
memory ; still, if such a training is patiently and steadily carried
on, this child will often prove to have quite as much aptitude as
others. Afterwards, this same child will often be able to master,
to the same degree of perfection, a hundred lines in an hour. The
steps should increase in proportion with the ability of the child,
but always below the power of memory. Instead of half a'line,
two lines may be learnt at a time, and immediately added to the
ten former lines without proceeding through the intermediate tests.
Whenever his utterances do not flow with a perfect ease, the rule
should be made more stringent at once. As it is difficult to have a
master for fifteen minutes, parents might undertake the task, while
twice a week the master could regulate the work. Ordinary students,
even beginners, may prepare their lessons by themselves; but they
can hardly help attempting to grasp more than they can keep at
a time, thus presenting to the teacher materials which it would be
impossible to keep. The duty of the teacher, then, is to do in the
test what the pupil had not will enough to do while learning, to
stop him as soon as he is fetching his words. Such pupils who,
with a teacher, will master a hundred lines in an hour, can only
master twenty when left to themselves. A piece learnt once
should not be left aside more than half a week, and should be
re-translated at least twice a week for a fortnight. Very seldom a
mistake will be found in any lesson but the last one; and should
a mistake or hesitation occur, the passage should at once pass
through a new test, so as to render mistakes in what was learnt
more than a fortnight previously altogether beyond a possibility.
Although it may appear stringent beyond measure, the precaution
is absolutely necessary, for experience shows that pupils may
repeat a piece for months twice a week and forget it by degrees,
if their mistakes are simply corrected without having to pass
through a new test. After a piece has passed through four tests
at half a week?s intervals, it may be re-translated only once a week
for at least six months, and then once every three months to the
end of the studies. Only translation into a foreign language is


compatible with this system, because the test through a translation?
into English would not be severe enough to secure materials so
well mastered as to stand reasonable intervals without getting out
of grasp. The immense superiority of translation into a foreign
language over conversation lies in this, that we can direct our
efforts at calculated intervals upon the object of our study, ranging
from two seconds to three months, to meet the weakness of our
memory.
If this system is within the reach of the meanest capacity, there
is none that shows so plainly, and at once, the measure of our
progress ; so that students who do not feel inclined to learn what
they wish to know, lose their delusions at once. Pupils are not
wanting who imagine they can learn a language by giving to its
study one hour a week, who, in reality, discounting regular,
occasional, and private holidays, take only two lessons a month,
while an unavoidable circumstance invariably prevents them from
having a look at their lessons at home. As it is as difficult to
master what has been forgotten as what has never been known,
the turn of the second lesson never comes. Then such pupils
will go to a conversation class where results are obtained at once;
and every time they attend, soever irregular they may be, they
are shown that they can talk, on new topics too. The conversa-
tion system has this precious advantage, that the retention of what
has been learnt previously is by no means required for the further,
progress of the pupil.
It may be asked, where shall we find the time required to reca-
pitulate constantly all that has been learnt before ? We have seen
that, contrary to what is generally done, in order to secure a safe
and permanent grasp over all that is to be kept up afterwards, the-
materials should pass through four severe tests, one of the conditions
of which is, that the delivery be as fluent as if the student were
speaking in his own language. In an animated conversation, we
can express as many as three thousand lines in an hour; the
student who should pronounce every sound plainly may confine
himself to fifteen hundred ; at any rate, no room is left for hesita-
tion. When the pupil is learning his lesson with his master, he-
cannot go so fast by far; this is only the rate of his delivery
when he is presenting his lesson for a test. In the system
generally in use, on the contrary, nineteen minutes out of twenty-
are given to hesitation ; the master finds the class time well filled
up when sixty lines altogether have been translated into French in.
one hour, each pupil giving a part of them. But we are far indeed
from the old systems. Let us suppose a pupil taking one hour?s
lesson twice a week, and who can master sixty lines before each
lesson ; his preparation?if unhelped, but conscientious?taking
less than two hours. He shall have to re-translate once a week
what has been learnt for the last six months ?viz., two thousand
and four hundred lines, and twice a week the last three lessons.


The whole work, divided into two sittings, will take fifty minutes
each time. Ten minutes remain for the new lesson, which, if
perfect, should take only two minutes. There remains a little
time to push him on a little further, or, if the lesson is not perfect,
to bring it on to the proper standard. How shall we proceed in
a class ? Let us suppose twelve pupils assembling for one hour
and a half twice a week, and presenting each one, on an
average, fifty lines at each class. Each pupil has thus to
say privately the last two hundred lines?that is, the last three
lessons and the new one ?twice a week, being two thousand and
four hundred lines divided among them. At the same time, at
another table under the supervision of the teacher, but presided
by a pupil, may sit pupils who are not engaged privately, and
attend the recapitulation. At that table may be translated nearly
five thousand lines a week, thus giving a wide range to pupils
more or less advanced than others, each pupil taking a part in it
only while the recapitulation is within the range of what he has
mastered. In a well-conducted school, there is no abuse to be
feared in the recapitulation circle ; the pupils, thus left to them-
selves, do the work at least as conscientiously as if a master were
presiding. It must be considered, also, that the work to be gone
over is mastered beyond the possibility of a mistake; so that, if
the sentences are all colloquial, it is by no means a tedious
exercise. It is a curious fact, that pupils are never so much
annoyed by a repetition as when they require it the most. A
pupil knowing a piece to perfection will always repeat it cheer-
fully. In the recapitulation, each pupil should translate a very
small fragment at a time, each fragment being pointed out by
a number, so as to leave very little intervals between each turn.
While the recapitulation is not within the range of what some
pupils have mastered, or is more than two thousand lines behind
the point they have reached, they are with the teacher, saying
their private lesson. As soon as they fail or fetch their words
they forfeit their turn, and are left to look over their lesson for the
next turn, when they are taken a little higher up than the place
they failed in. By this arrangement, two classes can master ten
thousand lines in about two years and a half, while each pupil
goes at his own speed without hindering the class in any way.
Such a description is not an imaginary one ?it is the description
of classes that do exist: the figures given represent the average of
the work done. Very few pupils are unable to translate fifteen
hundred lines in an hour; some translate eighteen hundred.
Many adults, however, are desperately slow, and in a class would
prove a great drawback. It is a matter of course that irregular
pupils, and those who never prepare their lessons, will stay
considerably behind; but they do not in any way hinder the
progress of the class ; and many who had never taken to work as
long as they were bound to follow one common course, proved


?quite as good as others when the teacher followed them step by
step. Only those who have tried the plan can form an idea of
the command which pupils have over a portion of a language thus
kept up through a year.
The treachery of memory being conquered, it remains to know
whether the perfect mastery of ten thousand lines is sufficient to
?enable us to converse. A pupil may have undergone this discipline
and be disappointed in that respect. The cause, however, is not
at all the one that might be supposed. It will be asked, how a
pupil can originate sentences without ever having attempted to do
so. It is admitted that one may originate sentences for years,
and not be able to originate at all when the course is over ; but is
the reverse true ? The experiment has been made many times,
and the reverse has invariably proved to be the case. Not only
the habit of originating sentences is useless, when the materials
used have been mastered with the precautions I shall have to
speak of hereafter, but it is an obstacle when it extends beyond the
genuine knowledge. A striking proof of this statement is given
by examinations in which are mixed pupils who were never
allowed to originate, and some who had taken that fatal habit
previously. If, after having mastered an equal amount of
materials, in an examination at sight they meet with an English
? expression not having its exact equivalent in the French which
they have mastered, the pupil who was accustomed to originate
will at once make French?that is to say, something horrible ; the
one who never originated has no such a tendency, and will at
once find an expression which, although inexact for the meaning,
will be perfectly correct. However astonishing it may be to hear
? a person speaking with a perfect accuracy and fluency, after
having done nothing but parrot-learning, as it is termed by people
who are wont to condense doubtful arguments into one w'ord, the
fact cannot be denied. Whoever wishes to make the experiment
may master Ollendorff?s exercises with a key, and ask a friend to
hear the translation. If the rules I have given before be
stringently complied with, the results will be most surprising.
But there are causes which, although generally disregarded, can
prevent our attaining fluency. Many examples of a word or
construction have to be mastered before this word or construction
fbe assimilated, so as to be at our command in whatever sentence
we want to introduce it. Some constructions require such a
number of examples that it is to be feared that, if unnecessary
constructions be not eliminated, there will not be room enough
for the useful but difficult ones. Hence the necessity of excluding
unnecessary constructions. The easiest words to assimilate are
those which have only one acceptation, correspond to one word
only in English, and have no peculiarity as for their inflection and
construction. Such words, mastered in one example, are generally
assimilated j if mastered in three examples, no one, soever dull he


may be, can help having them at command in whatever sentence
they are wanted. If a word has several acceptations, the number
of its examples mastered should be greater. One accepta-
tion may be an obstacle to the assimilation of another, then
each acceptation must be mastered in a greater number of
examples. Uncommon acceptations should be discarded. As
for constructions, they are of a far more difficult assimila-
tion. The mastery of a hundred examples of the usual
negative is not too much. Verbs constructed with objective
pronouns cannot be too numerous. Rules may be very simple
in theory and extremely difficult to practise, and vice versa;
the number of their examples should vary according to the
difficulty their assimilation presents. Very often, two construc-
tions may be equally useful, while the knowledge of the one can
dispense with the other: one of them should be discarded.
More than that, one construction may require the mastery of say
five examples ; if you introduce such other construction, not only
the latter, to be of any use, will require five examples also, but a
confusion arising, to dispel this obstacle to fluency, the number of
examples of each construction has to be doubled. The discarding of
one of these constructions would effect a great saving of time. 1 his
plan is very far indeed from the one adopted by grammarians, who
seem to make it a point to mention all possible and imaginable
constructions, except the common ones. To give an illustration,
let us take a pupil who has mastered ten examples of valoir
aidant, valoir mieux , corresponding to ?to be as well, to be
better or preferable.? Such a pupil has assimilated this idiom.
But if, before this idiom has taken deep roots in his mind, you let
him read in ? Alfred le Grand,? our present University text-book,
page 6, ?autant vaudrait suivre,? . . . or page g, ?mieux
vaut en revenir a raconter,? . . . or page 51, ? mieux vakit
pour lui donner que laisser prendre,? a confusion arises, and his
ten examples are no longer sufficient. Take away the elegant but
far fetched construction, the pupil knows quite as much, and
fluency is restored. Let us suppose that, in order to assimilate
the French for ?neither . . . nor,? the mastery of fifty
examples is required. Let a pupil master or read this sentence
in ? Alfred le Grand,? page 4, ? lors meme qu?il n?y ayait pas haine
et guerre,? and fifty examples are no longer sufficient. The
choice of the constructions to be discarded is not indifferent.
We say equally well, n?avoir pas , and ne pas avoir. The pupil
who will assimilate either construction the sooner is not
the one who masters examples of both, but rather the
one who masters only one. Which one shall we exclude?
Except with etre and avoir , it would be a mistake to use pas after
an infinitive. Some emphatical constructions used by writers do
not prevent the rule from being absolute in conversation. In
order to simplify the rule, the teacher should follow exclusively,


with avoir and etre, the construction which is absolutely required
with other verbs. Still more should he avoid letting his pupil
read in ?Alfred le Grand,? p. 53??Je te commande de
n?envahir pas ce sol.? This economy of constructions applies
only to those which are readily understood, or else they should
also be represented by an adequate number of examples. A text
prepared with the precautions above described would be too long
a task to expect it will ever be done. But by far the greatest
saving will easily be effected, if we confine ourselves to strictly
colloquial constructions, excluding even all those which a child
twelve years old is not likely to use. Words being easier to
assimilate, the most common words used exclusively by adults
could be introduced in those constructions. If lam allowed a
supposition that will illustrate my meaning rather than express an
exact fact, let us suppose that constructions, to be assimilated,
require the mastering, on an average, of ten examples. If, in our
ten thousand lines to be mastered, we have fifty thousand
examples of constructions, illustrating twenty-five thousand
different constructions, we can hardly expect to assimilate any.
Our chance of success is far greater if, while mastering fifty
thousand examples of constructions, we confine ourselves to two
thousand different constructions.
I have not spoken of the study of literature, because it is in
direct opposition with this plan; it may be said, however, that it
can hardly be called a study for pupils who have gone through
this training. However desirable the study of literature may be
as an accomplishment, there can be no worse introduction to a
language. This confusion is, however, made by the very many
who translate authors before they are able to speak at all.
As the study of languages must also be an instrument of
intellectual culture, no opportunity of awakening the intelligence
of pupils should be lost. We must not rely upon explanations,
because they leave too fugitive an impression; but examples
skilfully arranged will often speak to the mind as clearly at least
as an explanation would, and leave a lasting impression. Some-
times a short explanation may be given; but it must be
remembered that, unless the nature of the examples, or their
arrangement, reminds us of the explanation, it is a perfect waste
of time. I fail to see how the learning of a list of adjectives
governing a can be an instrument of intellectual culture; but
contrary to what grammarians are wont to do, I dread nothing so
much as conflicting associations of ideas. The different accepta-
tions of words, whenever the link that unites them is not obvious,
should be so arranged as to let the student have a clear insight
into the process the human mind has followed in their creation.
Far from that, the different acceptations of words are very often
a cause of puzzle. Shortened expressions should be preceded by
a more complete one that would explain it. Rules should as


?much as possible be ascribed to their causes. Grammar will tell
us that ? there is, there are ? is translated by voila, when we
point out a thing, and by il ya , when we do not. It will tell us
also that ? there he is ? is translated by le voila, the French using
then an objective pronoun instead of a nominative. Any unpre-
judiced person will admit that the part which intelligence has to
play in the application of these two rules is very small. But if,
without giving any rule, we take care to place before voila such
sentences as Je vois la un horame, Je le VOis la, and then
Voila un homme, Le voila, the case becomes clear at once ; the
two rules will henceforth remain associated with their cause. We
have gained time, and these examples being kept up for months
as they stand, the rule will not vanish as it would have done if we
had depended upon mere abstractions.
