International Aviation Contest
What It Means
E 0-DAY’S Contest stands as an epoch in Australian history, inasmuch
as it practically marks the birth of Aviation in Australia. The
twentieth century has witnessed many rapid advances from a
scientific point of view, but none more rapid, and it might surely be written
none more important than the wonderful development of aerial navigation.
The commercial aim, generally so prominent in scientific advance, must be and is
subordinated in this instance to the national aim. The aeroplane in war for both
offensive and defensive purposes threatens to become of supreme account in the
deliberations of nations. Australia has, therefore, every reason to be proud of
the fact that she is well to the tore and to-day takes her place among the nations
of the world in promulgating and fostering aerial navigation.

AUSTRALIA AND THE AVIATOR
USTRALIA, with its vast tracts of level countrj', its wide open spaces, its comparatively few
OWaJrO mountain chains, and its numerous excellent landing places, is an ideal land for the aviator.
wJMLKr That this is recognised by the defence authorities of the Commonwealth is demonstrated
MJsssSMi by the fact, that already orders for several airships for military purposes have been placed
by Senator Pearce. It is held by enthusiasts in aviation that a fleet of at least one thousand military
aeroplanes could be equipped for practically the cost of one battleship. Specially supplied stations
could be erected at intervals round the entire Australian coast; and as a journey of from two hundred
to three hundred miles is not an exceptionally big task for a trained airman in a well adjusted machine
the Commonwealth could be effectively defended by a fleet of aeroplanes.
The aerial machine is destined to revolutionise future fighting ; and it might well be the
duty of Australia, under expert advice, to build a fleet of aeroplanes for the defence of Australia, and
thus add to our sense of national security as against foreign attack. There can be no reason urged
against such a proposition—and to-day’s contest in truth marks the initiation thereof.

W. E. Mart
TS an Australian, and he holds the Australian record for a long-
-1 distance flight, having covered 47 miles in 55 minutes. During the
six months over which his flying career has spread he has covered
about 3000 miles in, approximately, 500 flights, has carried 150 passen-
gers, and on a recent air-journey from the Sydney Show Grounds he
attained an altitude of 6000 feet. He has had many strenuous and
exciting experiences while a probationer, and an account of the flight
that he made on the second day he took the machine up is recounted
by him as follows :—“ On this occasion I induced my brother Jack to
come for a fly to Parramatta, which is B i 9 miles distant. I then knew
practically nothing about an aeroplane. After a preliminary run along
the ground we rose to about three or four hundred feet, everything going
well. We soon found ourselves over the old town of Parramatta, and
then prepared to descend. On planing down we struck almost a gale,
the machine rocked and rolled so violently that we didn’t quite know
what was going to happen or how or where we were going to land. How-
ever, we managed to land safely much to our surprise. Having such a
rough experience, I decided to fly the machine back myself, and this was
successfully accomplished after a pretty rough passage.
His next flight was from Penrith to Sydney, where he had to land
on the Show Ground. It was like a ride over hurdles. The aviator had
to swerve and dodge poles and literally jump sign boards. At the time he
did not fully understand the extent of his task, and having flown in and
out successfully he says that he would not undertake the flight again
under any circumstances, as it is almost an impossibility.

“Wizard” Stone.
EUGENE STONE has had a varied career, and many thrills. He
flew in France and in America before he came to Australia, and
he commenced death-dodging as a racing-track cyclist in Denver,
U.S.A., where he quickly achieved fame as a world s champion, and was
one of the first cyclists to adopt motor pacing on the track. He then
became associated with motor cycle racing, and shortly afterwards
thrilled America, and in fact the entire world, by the most daring act
ever undertaken on a motor cycle. In company with Mrs. Stone he
encircled the inside of a lattice-work steel globe 40ft. in diameter, called
“The Globe of Death,’’ riding at a speed which rendered them almost
invisible to the audience. Having the nerve to undertake such an
adventure, it is not surprising to find that Mr. Stone was the third man
in the world to actually fly on a power machine. The two brothers
Wright were his only predecessors. Many sensational escapes have
been Wizard Stone’s good fortune. On one occasion, when flying in
America, he fell 600 ft. into a lake, and when tuning up his machine for
a race in which Graham White, Curtis, and other well-known aviators
took part, he fell a distance of 75ft. to earth, smashing his machine to
atoms, and finishing up with a ten-weeks' stay in hospital.

AN APPRECIATION
W. E. Hart, by qualifying as the first Australian Aviator, not only distinguished himself personally, but also
actually removed a reproach upon the nation. There are no lines of Lindsay Gordon’s more hackneyed than
these which run —
No game was ever yet worth a rap
; For a rational man to play,
Into which no accident, no mishap,
Could possibly find its way.
“Australia, as is well known, possesses the finest athletes in the world, men and lads, who play all the games
for all they are worth. It rather looked as if we were side-stepping aviation on account of that very element which
Gordon declared to tic necessary to make sport appetising-to -us. It is in tils connection Mr. Hart has to be
thanked, as well as congratulated.”

they kept in touch with headquarters

If you want inform-

don’t ask jealous com-
petitors or men abso-
lutely prcj ud iced
against American cars;
and, again,.don't judge
the “Cadillac” by
other American cars on
the market.
Stop the first “ Cadillac ’’ owner you see, and ask him how he likes his car ; ask him about “ Cadillac” service. Ask
him about the wonderful electric self-starter, and about ease and comfort. Ask him anything about his “ Cadillac” car. If
that does not satisfy you, ask all the “ Cadillac ” owners you see.
We have delivered a large number of 1912 “ Cadillacs” in New South Wales, and they are easy to find. Don’t hesitate
about asking any owner. They arc all proud to talk about their cars. Ask them how they are treated by John McGrath Ltd.
If you still seek information, ask any 1911 “ Cadillac” owner; ask any 1910, 1909, 1908, 1907, or some of the owners of
cars before that date what they think of “ Cadillac ” cars and “ Cadillac ” service.
The first “ Cadillac ” car ever made is still running. . .
We rest our-case entirely on what the owners tell you. Every “ Cadillac ” owner is a “Cadillac” salesman.

“Wizard” Stone makes some interesting
comments regarding TIME!
To-day when you see the rival airmen careering away on
their course, just consider what trying conditions are im-
posed upon the watch of an aviator. Then weigh, calmly
and carefully, the importance of Wizard Stone’s announce-
ment which we publish here :
Messrs, Frauds Ltd., 187 Pitt St., Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —You ask my opinion of the “ Howard ” watch. Well, it’s mighty
hard to put my exact opinion in words, because I actually regard that watch as one of
the most valuable possessions a man can have. You know we aviators are subjected to
very sudden variations of temperature, and that we experience much vibration, various
angles of position and even SHOCK.
Now, the ordinary watch is bound to go under when such conditions happen
along—it isn’t built for extremes, I reckon ! But I have never known the “ Howard ”
to vary in the least nor to be affected by the severe usage which it unavoidably receives
in aerial flights. I congratulate you on holding this agency and I trust Australians,
who seem keen on good articles, will appreciate the " Howard ’’ as fully as we Americans
do at home and abroad. —Yours faithfully,
(Signed) A. B. STONE.
THE HOWARD WATCH
Has long been associated with men who value precision.
Wilbur Wright, the aviator, found it the only watch that
would survive service in the air; Peary carried it to the
Pole ; Rear-Admiral Sigsbee, of the U.S. Navy has 42 years
vy duty to the credit of his “ Howard ” watch ' * '
of navy duty to the credit of his “ Howard ” watch, which
among other misadventures, survived FIVE DAYS IM-
MERSION IN SAI/T WATER but is still as accurate as ever. The Howard is BUII/T for service—it is accurately
adjusted to position, temperature, and isochronism. Neither jolt nor vibration can affect its hard-tempered balance
wheel. Send for the interesting booklets which describe this watch fully.
