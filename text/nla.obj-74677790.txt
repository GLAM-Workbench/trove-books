A FKIENDLY APPEAL,
William, William, wherefore linger
To perform a righteous deed,
In the pie you've had a finger,
In the pocket you must bleed.
Hasten, William, A. B.'s waiting,
Woodcock G? with calmness eyes
Isabella, friendless, fainting,
Urging once more for supplies.
In mercy listen unto reason,
What is foetid stir it not,
Soothe her care while grief's in season,
Kindness may not be forgot.
Just is coming, and his paper
May disturb thy happy home ;
? Bella's" poor,?if you forsake her
Eetribution's sure to come.
Take in sail and hous your topmast,
Heave to ?on the starboard tack,
Beef thy boom, and make your jib fast;
When the tide turns, ?then come back
To this caution pay attention,
Or on shore thy ship will be:
If once wreck'd, I need not mention,
You'll be poor as well as me.
Yours, in earnest,
John Ploughman
11 th December , 1870.
