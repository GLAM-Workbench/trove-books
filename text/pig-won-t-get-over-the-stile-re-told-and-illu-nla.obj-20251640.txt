Once upon a time there was an old woman who went to market and
bought a large fat pig.
As she was driving the pig homewards in front of her they came to a stile.
When he caught sight of the stile, Mr. Pig sat down in the middle of the
road and just refused to move. In vain the old woman pleaded with the pig
to get over the stile—he only sat there and grunted.

So presently the old woman got tired of asking the pig politely to get
over the stile, and she started to look about her for some means of
making him move.
She walked a little way up the road until she came upon a brown dog.
And to the dog she said:
Dog, dogl Bite pig; pig won’t get over the stile, and I shan’t
get home to-night.”
Indeed I won t, said the dog, for Pig never did me any harm.’’


So the old woman
walked a little further and
she came to a stick.
To the stick she said:
“Stick, stick! Beat
dog; dog won’t bite pig;
pig won’t get over the
stile, and I shan’t get home
to-night!”
“Indeed I won’t,”
said the stick, “for Dog
and Pig never did me any
harm."


So the old woman
walked a little further and
she came to a fire brightly
burning.
To the fire she said;
“Fire, fire! Burn
stick; stick won’t beat dog;
dog won’t bite pig; pig
won’t get over stile and I
shan’t get home to-night!’’
“Indeed I won’t,”
said the fire, “for the stick
and dog and pig never did
me any harm."


So the old woman walked a little further and she came to a bucket
of water.
To the bucket of water she said:
“Water, water I Quench fire; fire won’t bum stick; stick won’t beat
dog; dog won’t bite pig; pig won’t get over the stile, and I shan’t get
home to-night!’’
“Indeed I won’t," said the bucket of water, “for the fire and the stick
and the dog and the pig never did me any harm."


So the old woman walked a little further and she came to an ox.
To the ox she said:
"Ox, ox! Drink water; water won’t quench fire; fire won’t burn stick:
stick won’t beat dog; dog won’t bite pig; pig won’t get over the stile, and
I shan’t get home to-night I’’
"Indeed I won’t," said the ox, "for the water, the fire, the stick, the
flog and the pig never did me any harm."

So the old woman
walked on a little further
and she came to a butcher.
To the butcher she
Butcher, butcher 1
Kill ox; ox won't drink
water; water won’t quench
fire; fire won’t burn stick;
stick won’t beat dog; dog
won’t bite pig; pig won’t
get over the stile, and 1
shan’t get home to-night!”
“Indeed I won’t,”
said the butcher, "for the
ox, the water, the fire,
the stick, the dog and the
pig never did me any
harm."
said


So the old woman
walked on a little further
and she came to a rope.
To the rope she said;
“Rope, rope! Hang
butcher; butcher won t kill
ox; ox won’t drink water;
water won’t quench fire;
fire wont burn stick; stick
won’t beat dog; dog won’t
bite pig; pig won’t get
over the stile, and I shan’t
get home to-night!’’
‘lndeed I won’t,’’
said the rope, “for the
butcher, the ox, the water,
the fire, the stick, the dog
and the pig never did me
any harm.”


So the old woman walked on a little further and she came to a rat.
To the rat she said:
“Rat, rat! Gnaw rope; rope won’t hang butcher; butcher won't
kill ox; ox won’t drink water; water won’t quench fire; fire won’t burn
stick; stick won’t beat dog; dog won’t bite pig; pig won’t get over the
stile, and I shan’t get home to-night!’’
“Indeed I won’t,” said the rat, “for the rope, the butcher, the ox,
the water, the fire, the stick, the dog and the pig never did me any harm."


So the old woman walked on a little further and she came to a
fat black cat sitting by the roadside and washing his left ear with
his paw.
And to the cat the old woman said:
“Oh, cat, call Eat rat; rat won’t gnaw rope; rope won’t hang
butcher; butcher won’t kill ox; ox won’t drink water; water won’t
quench fire; fire won’t burn stick; stick won’t beat dog; dog won’t bite
pig; pig won’t get over the stile, and I shan't get home to-night!’’
“Most certainly! That I will!’’ cried the cat, “for I hate the
thought of all rats!”
And almost before you could wink

And the pig and the
dog and the stick and the
fire, and the water and the
ox and the butcher, and
the rope and the rat and
the cat all jumped over
the stile together; so the
old woman got home in
time for supper after all!
