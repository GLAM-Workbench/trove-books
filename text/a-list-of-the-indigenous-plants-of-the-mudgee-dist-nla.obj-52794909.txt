A LIST OF THE INDIGENOUS PLANTS OF THE
MUDGEE DISTRICT.
BY ALEXANDER G. HAMILTON.
In my list of tlie Orchidepe of this district (Proc. Linn. Soc. of
N.S.W., Vol. L, 2nd Ser, 1886, p, 865), I promised at some
future time to furnish a list of the phsenogamous plants and
the ferns. That promise I now fulfil in the hope that it may be
of some use in the elucidation of the question of the geographical
distribution of species.
The remarks that applied to the distribution of orchids in this
district, apply equally to the other families. The sandstone found
on the Dividing Range supports the plants that are typical of the
sandstone elsewhere. But there is, among the remaining families
a greater proportion of species differing from the coast forms than
is found among the orchids. These differing forms however,
appear to be representatives of the coast plants.
In one or two sheltered spots there are many species not
occurring elsewhere about Mudgee. For example, in a deep
gully at Mullarauddy are found Pittosporum undulatum, Eucalyp-
tus globulus, Nicotiana suaveolens, Sarnhucus xanthocarpa, Siurmia
reflexa, Dendrohium speciosum, and Fteris aquilina, none of which
occur generally over the district, although the last three grow at
Cooyal, on the Dividing Range. Some other plants, rare else-
where, are common in this ravine.


Regarding the occurrence of Eucalyptus globulus so far from its
head quarters, I am of opinion that it is a survival from a cooler
and moisten climate. The trees—about a dozen and some
saplings—grow only in a deep rocky glen surrounded on three sides
by precipitous walls of igneous rock. Possibly at one time the
tree was common all over the surrounding country, and, as the
climate changed, it gradually died off, leaving only a few survivors
in the most sheltered situations. In support of this view, I may
mention that I have since seen specimens of the tree from the
Meroo, procured in a deep gully there, but higher and more south-
ward than Mudgee.
Mullamuddy, where Mr. J. D. Cox and myself discovered it, is
over 2,000 feet above sea level. The only other locality in New
South Wales where it has been collected is Araluen, which is
about 230 miles south from Mudgee as the crow dies. There, the
Rev. R. Collie tells me, it grows, not in a deep shady gully, but on
the top of a hill. This may be accounted for by the more southern
latitude, and the nearer approach to the sea moderating the
climate sufficiently to allow it to exist in a more exposed situation.
As far as I know it has not been collected between Mudgee and
Araluen, or between the latter place and its Victorian habitat, but
should it be discovered in either gap, it would, I think, be strong
evidence in favor of the survival theory. Mr. J. D. Cox agrees
with me in this view, and in thinking it improbable that the
trees have come from bird-carried seeds. This might be inferred
from there being trees 60 feet or more high and 2 feet in diameter,
side by side with younger trees and saplings. Another circum-
stance at variance with the supposition of bird-carried seeds, is the
occurrence of the above-named plants in this limited spot, and the
fact that the insects differ from those of the district in general.
I particularly noticed a large Pieris with brilliant underwings
feeding on the blossoms of the Pittosporum. This insect I had
previously seen about Sydney frequenting the same species of tree,
and also orange trees.


Roughly speaking, the district I have collected over might be
described as extending from Appletree Flat to Reedy Creek, and
from the Dividing Range at Cooyal to the top of the Ridge
separating the Meroo Creek from the Valley of the Cudgegong
River. The average height of the district might, 1 think, be fairly
taken as that of the Mudgee Railway Station, which is 1,635 feet
above sea level. The highest point within these limits is pro-
bably Buckaroo or Big Hill, (from which the Mullamuddy Gully
runs), which as measured by Mr. Cox is 1,640 feet above river
bed—probably 3,000 feet above the sea. The geological formation
is principally Silurian, with occasional patches of granite, as near
Home Rule, limestone (at Canadian and Mt. Frome), and basaltic
outflows. The coal measures extend down the valley of Reedy
Creek from Cooyal; and at Guntawang a shale with Glossopteris
and other fern impressions occurs at a small depth below the
surface. The shale also extends to Beaudesert. The district is
well-known as being highly auriferous.
The annual mean temperature is 61'3° F.; the mean for three
summer months (Decem., Jan. and Feb.) is 72 , 7° F. ; winter
mean (June, July and August) 49'5° F. In 1886 the highest
observed temperature was 103 - 6° F. in February, and the lowest
21-6° F. in July. (1.) The average rainfall is 25-24 inches,
September being usually the wettest month. The six years ending
1885 were below the average, but 1886 was 9-26 inches above,
and 1887 promises to be a very wet year, 31*81 inches having
fallen up to March 31.
A few of the plants named in the following pages I have not
collected myself, but their names were supplied to me by Dr.
(1) The above extremes of temperature would give a rather incorrect
impression of the Mudgee climate, but a consideration of the following
means for each month (kindly supplied by Air. Lenehan, Acting Government
Astronomer), will show its equability :
Jan. 74-1° F. April, 65 TF. July, 47-4° F. Oct. 56-4° F.
Feb. 74-3 May, 58'9 Aug. 48'8 Nov. 67'2
Mar. 71'6 June, 52 - 3 Sept. 55'1 Dec. 69 - 8.


Woolls, to whose untiring kindness I owe a great deal of help in
this and other botanical matters. I am indebted to Mr. Percy
Williams for a note on the occurrence of Styphelia viridis at
Cooyal.
In collecting towards the west and north-west—towards Cob-
bora for instance—a slight change is noticeable in the character of
the vegetation, showing an approximation to the flora of the
plains ; but it is not at all marked till Cobbora is passed, which is
far beyond the limits of the Mudgee district. Eastward from
Mudgee the change to the sandstone vegetation is very sudden,
the ordinary forms occurring right up to the foot of the Dividing
Range.
The remarks I made on the gradual extinction of some species
of orchids apply with equal force to the plants in this list, culti-
vation, clearing, and the influx of introduced plants being the
principal factors concerned in their disappearance. The last is
very noticeable in land ringbarked or cleared, the sudden appear-
ance and growth of aliens being then very marked. Drought is
not so potent an agent as might be thought. About six years ago
I collected Euphrasia scabra in a cleared paddock near my own
residence. As it was so near, I neglected to preserve specimens,
and during the five dry years which followed, not one plant was
to be found. The moist summer of 1886 however, brought it up
again in the same limited locality, so that the seeds must have
existed with unimpaired vitality through five years’ droughts,
during which the paddock was more than once burnt. This
remark also applies to Centrolepis fascicularis, which sprang up
after the same long interval in that locality.
It will be seen that I have included the orchids in this list
although I have already given a paper on the subject. But I
thought it would be better not to break the regular sequence of
the orders by leaving them out.
I hope soon to give a list of the introduced plants of the district.
The nomenclature and arrangement adopted is that of the
Systematic Census of Australian Plants by Baron F. v. Mueller.


After the specific names, habitat, and period, month or
season of flowering, the figures which follow are meant to indicate
where the plant is found elsewhere besides the District of Mudgee.

about February ; 4.
Eucalyptus, L’Her.
stellulata, Sieb. I include this tree among our flora on the
authority of Mr. C. Moore in an article on “ Timbers of
N.S.W.” in “ Industrial Progress of N.5.W.,” 1870. It
is also mentioned as from Mudgee in Mr. Arvid Nilson’s
“ Timber Trees of N.5.W.,” 1880; 2.
macrorrhynciia, F.v.M. The stringy-bark commonest in
the district; 2.
capitellata, Sm. Only found on sandstone as at Cooyal
and Reedy Creek, and the Warrable Hills, Home
Rule; 19.
eugenioides, Sieb. Recorded as from Mudgee by Dr.
Woolls in a paper on “ Eucalypts of County of Cumber-
land” in P.L.S. N.S.W. Vol.'V. p. 491 ; 2.
Sm. Var. micrantha. “ Spotted Gum ;” not
common; 5.
leucoxylon, F.v.M. “Red Ironbark;” common on slaty
ridges ; flowers usually red, but sometimes creamy
white; 8.
melliodora, Cunn. “ Yellowbox;” common, but appears to
flourish best on the river flats and uplands ; timber good,
invaluable as fuel; 2.
polyanthema, Sch. “ Slaty-Gum;” common on ridges,
where it does not attain a great size, but on flats at
Tallewang it runs up into splendid trunks, which are
much used in bridge-building, etc., the timber being
considered very durable; bark smooth ; 2.


Eucalyptus, L’Hur.
popuufolia, Hook. Dr. Woolls informed me that this tree
occurs in our district; 3.
largiflorens, F.v.M. “ Fuzzy-Box Two Mile Flat; 8.
hemipiiloia, F.v.M. “ White-Box two distinct trees in
this district are known as white-box, but one having
smooth shining dark green leaves is sometimes called
“ green white-box ”or “ green-box this grows on flats
and has small seed vessels : the other which has pow-
dery bluish leaves and larger fruits is named in contra-
distinction “ grey white-box it frequents stony hills.
On the lower foot hills both may sometimes be found.
No. 1 flowers in April and May, and has different leaves
in the young plants, and No. 2 flowers in June and July.
It is probably E. aliens (Mig.) which I believe is now
united with E. heniiphloia, but I cannot help thinking
they are distinct; the only point of resemblance is tho
bark. Both afford desirable timber, and excellent
fuel; 8.
SIDEROPHLOIA, Benth. “ White Ironbark Reedy Creek ;
considered by some timber-getters the better of the two
ironbarks ; but others hold an opposite opinion ; 2.
globulus, Labill. Only at Mullamuddy ; the Meroo, from
whence I have seen other specimens, lies outside the
boundaries I have mentioned ; only seeds and buds on
the trees in October; the seeds collected germinated
freely; 24.
GONIOCALYX, F.v.M. On the authority of Dr. Woolls, who
mentions it in his work, “ The Plants of N. S. Wales,”
1885; 19.
Stuart [ama, F.v.M. Known in vicinity of Mudgee as
“Peppermint,” and at Cooyal as “Woolly Butttimber
not good; makes very bad fuel, but when burnt,
excellent charcoal; 25.
viminalis, Labill. “ White Gum Home Rule, Cooyal, and
more sparsely all over the district; 25.


Eucalyptus, L’Her.
dealbata, F.v.M. This, Dr.Woolls says, is regarded by some
as a variety of the preceding, but I have little doubt that
it is a good species. It is known as “ White,” or “ Cab-
bage-gum”; useless for timber as it chips off and warps so
much that, if bolted down, the bolts sink into the wood
as it curls; Cooyal, Home Rule, Biraganbil.
ROSTKATA, Schl. “ River Gum,” “ Yarrah ;” grows only on
river flats; some of the old trees of this species are
perfect studies for the landscape painter, and a portfolio
might be filled with “bits” of the most delightful kind
on the Menah Flat alone, where the trees have a gnarly
character with drooping foliage that I have not observed
elsewhere ; timber good, but in large logs almost impos-
sible to burn; 13.
tereticornis, Sm. “Blue Gum;” Reedy Creek, Two Mile
Flat, Home Rule. Whatever doubts may exist as to the
capabilities of the Mudgee district in other respects, it
must be admitted to be unrivalled in the production of
wool, and few districts, as will be seen from list above,
excel it in producing hardwood. I think there is a great
future before Mudgee in the matter of timber production,
and those who have seen its forest-clad hills will, I am
sure, agree with me ;* 4.
Metrosideros, Bks.
glomulipera, Sm. Collected by Dr. Woods ; 3.
RHAMNACEiE.
Pomaderris, Labill.
lanigera, Sims. Cooyal; Summer; known to settlers by
the curious name of “Wild Quince ;” 24.
• In addition to the above Eucalypts, I have in my list E. botryoides,
Sm., and E. obliqua, L’Heritier, but as I have forgotten the authority for
including them, and can find no references to them in my notes, I thought
it best not to include them, especially as both are coast-loving trees.

CAMP AN UL ACEiE.
Lobelia, Linn.
simplicicaulis, R. Br. On hills; Summer; usually forms a
thick stem in Spring, and then when the heat of Summer
comes on, having but slight root-hold, it draws upon the
Store of nutriment in its stem to enable it to blossom ; I
have often collected it with the roots so dry that they
would crumble in my fingers, and yet it was quite fresh
and bright looking in its blossoms and leaves above the
thicker stem; 25.

habitat, but it certainly cannot be considered so here, as
the range on which it occurs is not more than 2,000 feet
above the sea, and it is found from top to bottom of it,
being more luxuriant in the latter situation on account
of the more abundant moisture ; 1.

Comparing the above list with Dr. Woolls’s “Plants Indigenous
to the Neighbourhood of Sydney,” it will be seen that in the
County of Cumberland the numbers stand as follows (leaving out
Characece which are not included in my list) :

The following 28 Orders occur in Cumberland, but not in
Mudgee :— Nymphacece, Magnoliaceoe, Anonacea;, Monimiaceas,
Menispermece, Tremandreas, Meliacem, Tiliaceas, Viniferai, Celas-
trinece, Ficoideas, Saxifrageas, Fassiflorece, Cucurbitaceas, Logani-
acece, Sapolacece, Ebenacece, Jasminece, Apocynece, Asclepiadeas,
Lenlibularinew, Acanthacece, Fhilydrece, Xyridece, Palmas, Aroidece,
Eriocaulece, and Lycopodinece.
There are only two Orders found in Mudgee which do not
extend to Cumberland, viz., Nyctagineas and Zygophylleas.
Cumberland has 209 Genera not found in Mudgee, while
Mudgee has but 24 not found in Cumberland, as follows :
Gheiranthera, Tribulus, Sagina, Trichinium, Euxolus, Boerhaavia,
Psoralea, Geratophyllum, Colletia, Baums, Crantzia, Gnaphaloides,
Minuria, Ammohiuin,Angianihus, Centaurea, Crepis, Leewenhoehia,
JSvartothamnus, Beyeuxia, Sorghum, Erianihus, Alopccurus, and
Osmunda, having in all 28 species.
In the following leading Orders the numbers of Mudgee and
•Cumberland species are as indicated :
305
BY ALEXANDER G. HAMILTON.


The last is, I believe, the only order in this district with more
species than in Sydney.
Among the orders not mentioned above, the following are more
strongly represented in Cumberland in the proportions indicated.
Rutace.e ... ... ... ... 32 to 5
Labiate 24 to 9
Euphokbiace.® 21 to 9
Riiamnace.® ... ... ... 11 to 3
Steuculiace;e ... ... ... 10 to 1
Laurace.® ... ... ... ... 7 to 1
The following species are extremely local in their occurrence
here : — Pittosporum undulatum, Acacia amocna. Eucalyptus glob-
ulus, Sambucus xanthocarpa, Solanum stelligerum, S. campanu-
latum, Nicotiana suaveolens, Woodwardia caudata at Mulla-
muddy; Pittosporum phillyroides, Geijera salicifolia, and Prostan-
thera linearis at Two Mile Elat; Acacia lunata, Corysanthes
Hamiltonii, Pterostylis striata and Caladenia arenaria, in the Beau-
desert Hills; Baeckia Gunninghamii and Pterostylis clavigera at
Biraganbil; Dodoncea lobulata, Exocarpus strictus, and Grevillea
Jloribunda at Cullenbone ; and Acacia triptera and Melaleuca nodosa
at Reedy Creek. Cooyal has about 92 species not found else-
where in the district.
Doubtless there are many more species both at Cooyal and all
over the district which I have not succeeded in collecting, but if
I should meet with such I will include them in a supplementary
paper at some future time.
If any member of the Linnean Society would compile a list of
the indigenous plants round Wellington and Dubbo, it would be
very interesting to compare with the above, and would undoubtedly
be of great service in making out the geographical range of Aus-
tralian plants. More would be learned from a comparison of two
local floras not far removed, than in the comparison of two with
such a wide gap between them as those of Cumberland and
Mudgee.
