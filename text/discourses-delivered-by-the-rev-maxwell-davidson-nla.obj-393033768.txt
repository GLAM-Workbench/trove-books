on didactic morality, in prose-fiction, or poetry. It is
handed down to us in the records of India, Egypt,
Greece, and Rome. All are agreed here. The sacred
and secular—the natural and supernatural,—both
alike declare the innate conviction of the world on
the subject.
Men look for the outward proof of their instinct,
sometimes in the external condition of the wicked man,
sometimes in his internal state. They often err in ex-
pecting the results of his vice, and pride, and impiety,
to be poverty, famine, and bodily suffering. He may

all internal .-strength. It is true 4;hat-~sin_ introduces
bodily suffering into the first, second, or third genera-
tions; but the moral philosopher and the divine-are not
called upon to search so deeply into its ramifications.
The heart of man pronounces at once that injustice
brings a penalty after it; that if you like you may say
that the suffering is contained or rolled up in the unjust
act; that the deed itself has poisoned the man’s whole
nature; that it has given a dark hue to his whole con-
stitution ; that it has, in some degree, tinged his whole
powers. They do not require to trace its workings to
moral, and physical, and intellectual degradation at
some distant day. When they see the injustice, the
falsehood, they know most assuredly that these causes

So the psalmist had “ seen the wicked in great
power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree
yet “he passed rapidly away, and lo he was not.” It
was not necessary for the strong and decided assertion
of the writer to have been uttered with such a real


character in view : the general principle in the heart of
the author declared that it must be so. It would have
been a contradiction to the moral nature God had
impressed on man’s mind, for the sinner to be prosperous
outwardly and prosperous inwardly. If any individual
would now attempt to prove that a false, unjust, selfish
character, is more likely to produce real happiness and
true success in every aspect of our being—if he could
even, as I said, enumerate more of these than of the
opposite description, his logic and his overwhelming
instances would get no fair play. The majority would
not believe his array of examples contrary to a strong
and ineradicable instinct. A strong and ineradicable
instinct it is; because, when we do not see the punish-
ment overtake the transgressor in this world, we say it
will in the next. In other words, the natural moral
feelings will have him to suffer; and, if not now, he
must pay the penalty in a future day.
“He sought him, but he could not be found.” The
writer sees that nothing can remain of the wicked. He
vanishes out of sight. If the Hebrews had not always a
future state to reward their good, they had the idea
that they could never beTforgotten on earth; that the
unrighteous must die out of all remembrance. Job
said earlier than David, “ Drought and heat consume the
snowwaters, so doth the grave those which have sinned.
The womb shall forget him : the worm shall feed sweetly
on him : he shall be no more remembered.” Thus it is
that the divine revelation given to man is agreeable to,
and founded on, his better moral instincts. The unbe-
liever has more to do than to overturn the supernatural
in the Bible; he has also to deny his own convictions as

far as these agree with the leading principles of the
Old and New Testaments. The same may be said of the
latter verse of our text; “ Mark the perfect man and

Just as it is natural for man to believe, that though
hand join in hand the wicked shall not go unpunished >
so the scriptures assert that peace attends the just. Of
course no one attaches any such meaning to the word
perfect here, as is required in modern creeds—viz., some
perfection which is attributed to the believer from an
infinite sacrifice. There is none perfect in that literal
sense. The scriptures used it just as we use it. When
we say he is a perfect man, we mean that the general
tenor of his conduct is beautiful, and true, and upright.
As belonging to humanity he is not perfect in the literal
sense; but as a man with limited knowledge and limited
powers, he may be called perfect.
It has only a slight variety of meaning from the other
word upright; and the unbiassed reader of the scrip-
tures feels no difficulty in understanding what they
mean by it. The psalmist asserts, without going into
any proof, that his end is peace. The same sentiment
is uttered by the inspired writers in every variety of
phraseology. No poverty, no contempt;—not having
where to lay his head; —no matter in what circum-
stances the upright man may be the scriptures
declare that all is well with him ; that the righteous is
more excellent than his neighbour. If it be in the
Old Testament, then length of days must be with him,
and riches, and honour. If it be in the New Testa-

presence of God : in the Old, there is no want to them
that fear Him. “ The young lions do lack and suffer
hunger, but they that wait upon the Lord shall not
want any good thing.”
Now evidently the later revelation of Christianity
has, to our finite judgment, an advantage here. In the
more ancient dispensation they asserted the natural
belief of man without having a future life revealed
from which to reason; and it was a moral con-
viction that the upright should have all good. There
was no good, or but a little, to give him, except
houses and lands, long life, riches, honour, and
a numerous family. They gave to the godly all they
had in their knowledge to give him. He ought to have
the best, and they awarded to him what they thought
best. In the new, it is infinitely higher as a reward;
and, in proportion to its enlarged prospect, much more
true and correct. It is not always, or necessarily, that
a fleeting, temporary benefit attends the excellent in
soul. The material goods may be present or they
may be absent, in this new revelation we'are paid in
kind. Justice has its own reward in the moral nature
of him who practices it; —benevolence brings its recom-
pense to the heart of him in whom it resides; —truth-
fulness spreads a clear sunshine over the whole soul cf
the truthful man; —moral, religious, and spiritual
power, is paid with moral and spiritual power. To
them that hath, more shall be given unto them. Im-
mortal qualities are recompensed with immortality.

Many a time the natural instinct of man, which said


that all prosperity should be the portion of the just,
was puzzled and bewildered when it saw him in active
life in suffering and want.
Never so in Christianity. Christ shewed that the
favour and light of God were always round the steps of
the righteous; that, as far as real happiness and true
peace were concerned, that godliness was profitable for
this world as well as the next. He gave-no promise
of immediate temporal prosperity ; but he taught that
there is immediate spiritual and religious peace. The
whole faculties of the soul are brought into health and
harmony by virtue and religion. These powers are all
discordant in the irreligious and immoral. It is said
they are like the troubled sea, because the conduct and
the thoughts are at variance with the conscience. Hence
reconciliation to God is another name for the several
affections and principles of man’s nature being fully
developed and reconciled to each other. Not that the
principles and the conduct should be reconciled to a
hardened, untaught sense of right and wrong, but that
the disposition, thoughts, and desires, should be brought
into harmony with a conscience enlightened and made
delicate by the precepts and spirit of Jesus Christ. It
is, then, the only voice of God that the Christian has.
He has no higher guide than that; and when the
whole being’s walk and conversation are at one with it,
he then has perfect peace —he is in the most perfect
state that his God intended he should be in.
The chief object of public worship is, then, the en-
lightening and strengthening of our sense of right and
wrong. The hymn, the prayer, the reading of the
scriptures, are to suggest the purity, the benevolence*

It is true the service may be a languid and feeble one,
and the worshipper may have neither a strong moral
nor a strong religious sense, yet rarely will he attend
public worship without having some of his higher
faculties moved. If he be induced to think of God in
the least degree, that thought cannot depart without
dispersing some dark shades of malice, or cruelty, or
selfishness. The abode of that idea only a short time
in the mind, must purify it to some degree. The con-
science will be made somewhat more sensitive and
clearer by its residence. It is true the immoral does
not like to bear this awakened conscience. Its shaip
pangs are intolerable to him. Hence he cannot attend
or listen to strong moral dissertations. h<o religion,
or Catholic absolution, suits him best; yet after he
has obtained his absolution, he cannot rise in the divine
or higher life without this moral discipline. He must
allow his conscience to be purified and instructed. He
must bear this moral discipline sooner or later. His
absolution is only a ceremony: It he believe it, it
may give him hope and take away the dread of an
offended Deity; but his real training in the moral and
religious life has then to begin. It is utterly giound-
less to suppose that any charm of this kind can in a
moment raise a man from the lowest spiritual and
moral degradation, to the highest pinnacle of the divine
life; that he could, as it were, pass over all the inter-
mediate steps. This would be contrary to the whole
analogy of nature and of intellectual progress. Ihe
operations of the material world are all gradual, slow,
and move by law. The acquirements ol the intellect are


made step by step. Morality is no exception to this
grand and beautiful principle.
It is not likely that the nobler part of man’s being—
his spiritual attributes, should rise and fall by chance;
that he should be able to converse with the spirits of
just men made perfect, when up to that time he had
not truthfulness, principle, benevolence enough to
enable him to be a worthy citizen of this imperfect
society on earth. All these miraculous and sudden
conversions are the work of priestcraft. There is no-
thing in them of the peace which attends the perfect
man, which is the possession of the upright. The end
of that man is peace ; —that is, the effects of the
generally upright life are more marked, and seen, and
felt at the approach of death. Not that they are felt
only then : they are felt and experienced as soon as
the individual strives after this perfection. These in-
fluences appear in all his life here. He is the man of
principle. He is the only man on whom you can
depend. There is a large number on whom you cannot
depend or trust for any thing where their interest or
their pleasure may interfere.
To bel’eve any individual to have sterling principle,
is certainly to have the highest opinion of him. That
quality surpasses every thing besides. Riches are much
sought after, and their possession generally envied;
genius and talents are greatly admired; the polite
accomplishments are very attractive; but if you find
out that the possessor is devoid of truthfulness, steadi-
ness of purpose—if you are unable to believe that you
will find him the same individual to-morrow that he
professed himself to be to-day, then all these outward

case. That it was their retiring habits, their diffidence,
that held them back; their reluctance to draw the
world’s attention to them. That some of them who
have rendered the most substantial service to the cause
by regular attendance here, by personal exertions, by
large pecuniary contributions, never wished to hold
any office—never wished to have their names known
as taking a conspicuous part in its commencement.
That it was a sense of duty, an imperative sense ot
doing their duty, and no more. When they saw the
young and the middle-aged of those families who had
been here some time, becoming lukewarm or indifferent
to their own religious principles, and attending
churches where they heard doctrines taught in which
they did not believe; —when they had the prospect of
many coming out from other countries of the same
faith, and who must of necessity follow the same
course, these circumstances did morally compel them
to the steps they have taken. As we are ap-
proaching the half yearly meeting, I have made
these references to the motives that impelled the
first formation of the society. It will be ii subject
of deep disappointment to many of us, if we find many
hollow hearts or rotten branches among those from
whom we expected aid and encouragement. I shall
find it peculiarly trying, because I have been accus-
tomed to place unbounded reliance on any thing a
Unitarian professed to do. I have never attributed to
them over much zeal or great enthusiasm; but in
steadiness, firmness, and consistency, I did believe
that they were surpassed by no other division of the
Christian church. I did, and I do, think, that how-


and your families. That this colony has been in
existence upwards of sixteen years, in a very flourish-
ing material condition j and that, during all that time,
there had been no assembling of Unitarians to worship
God according to the dictates of their own conscience,
is a subject that suggests serious thoughts. 1 know
there are persons of strong religious feelings who all
that time continued reading the religious literature of
the body and other religious books; who attended
some place of worship, and, by these means, kept up
their spiritual tone of mind. But even these will
admit that it was an up-hill and powerful task, when
the sentiments they heard preached were directly
opposed to their deepest and long cherished con-
victions.
I think, then, that it would be a dangerous experi-
ment to subject the great number of young men that
are now in this colony, and every day coming to it, to
a similar period devoid of all public instruction in their
own faith. I think, then, that the zeal of those must
be at a low ebb—their own religious feelings not very
vivid, who can assert that we have begun too soon to
have public worship. I think all of us who have been
here several years ought to move forward with a firm
and steady step to make amends for past indifference
and neglect of duty. To those who have come into the
colony lately, and who do not know the feelings and
sentiments that actuated the minds of those who made
the first movement in the formation of this society, I
can assure them that it was no desire of notoriety that
prompted them; that it was no ambition to be the
leaders of a party. That quite the contrary was the


properties, or ornaments, or possessions, only serve to
make him more despicable, more an object of con-
tempt. No outward circumstance can be of any avail
to recommend the man who has no heart, no moral
affections, no soul, no principle. In short, it is these
that make the man; and without them he only has the
form of humanity.
I think that most of the society who has worshipped
here for these last five months, concur with me in these
views. There is not much mystery about them, and they
may not at all suit those who love absolution, and sudden
conversion, and great enthusiasm; but I believe that
they have this one good quality, that of being rational,
and at all times in consonance with the soberest and
the best experiences of mankind; that they are founded
on the general teachings of the Old and New Testa-
ments ; that they do bring real peace and true honour
to their possessor on earth; and that they do perpe-
tually keep up in his mind the hope of glory, immor-
tality, and eternal life in a world to come.
I think, then, that to most of those whom I have
alluded to, it will be evident that no division of the
Christian church is called upon to pay more attention
to the training of the moral and religious nature, than
the Unitarians; because we do not believe that there
are miracles now performed in our salvation; —because
we believe that to grow in virtue and religion is a
gradual growth; that exercise in this department is of
as much influence as in the raising of the intellectual
powers; that the total neglect of private and public
worship must eventually bring in a degradation or
lowering of the whole moral and religious tone of you


and your families. That this colony has been in
existence upwards of sixteen years, in a very flourish-
ing material condition j and that, during all that time,

be at a low ebb—their own religious feelings not very
vivid, who can assert that we have begun too soon to
have public worship. I think all of us who have been
here several years ought to move forward with a firm
and steady step to make amends for past indifference
and neglect of duty. To those who have come into the
colony lately, and who do not know the feelings and
sentiments that actuated the minds of those who made
the first movement in the formation of this society, I
can assure them that it was no desire of notoriety that
prompted them; that it was no ambition to be the
leaders of a party. That quite the contrary was the


case. That it was their retiring habits, their diffidence,
that held them back; their reluctance to draw the
world’s attention to them. That some of them who
have rendered the most substantial service to the cause
by regular attendance here, by personal exertions, by
large pecuniary contributions, never wished to hold
any office—never wished to have their names known
as taking a conspicuous part in its commencement.
That it was a sense of duty, an imperative sense ot
doing their duty, and no more. When they saw the
young and the middle-aged of those families who had
been here some time, becoming lukewarm or indifferent
to their own religious principles, and attending
churches where they heard doctrines taught in which
they did not believe; —when they had the prospect of
many coming out from other countries of the same
faith, and who must of necessity follow the same
course, these circumstances did morally compel them
to the steps they have taken. As we are ap-
proaching the half yearly meeting, I have made
these references to the motives that impelled the
first formation of the society. It will be ii subject
of deep disappointment to many of us, if we find many
hollow hearts or rotten branches among those from
whom we expected aid and encouragement. I shall
find it peculiarly trying, because I have been accus-
tomed to place unbounded reliance on any thing a
Unitarian professed to do. I have never attributed to
them over much zeal or great enthusiasm; but in
steadiness, firmness, and consistency, I did believe
that they were surpassed by no other division of the
Christian church. I did, and I do, think, that how-


ever their political or religious views may have been
modified in the course of centuries, that much of the
noble spirit of Milton, and Newton, and Locke, and
Priestly, and Channing, still animates them, and will
always confer on them something of the respectability
and esteem that belong to these honoured names.
I hope, then, that those who have begun so good a
work will neither turn baelc nor look to the right hand
nor to the left; that they will walk straight on. I
hope that they will receive every encouragement from
those young men that arc now coming and have lately
come out. There are innumerable ways in which this
encouragement and aid can be given. It is useless to
specify them to the willing mind. As we have now
commenced the erection of a church, every thing
should be done to further its completion. Till we get
that completed, we have no stable foundation laid. It
is hard that we alone should be without a place for
moral and religious instruction; —we, who believe that
we are, under God, to work out our own salvation ;
that God did not, before the world was, predestinate
one to everlasting life and another to everlasting
misery—we, who believe that man is not totally and
wholly depraved, but that he can, with moral and
religious exercises, seek after God; and, by persever-
ance, attain the highest perfection of which his nature
is capable —we, who believe that the worship of God is
a most rational worship, and worthy of the highest
intellect—we, who believe that it is unscriptural and
irrational to depend on the absolution of a priest at the
dying hour—we, who believe that every sin must be
repented of before peace can be obtained ; that every

O God, our Heavenly Father; Thou who art eternal,
immortal, and invisible, —in whom we live, and move,
and have our being, —we know that Thou dwellest not
in temples made with hands, —neither art Thou wor-
shipped by men’s hands as though Thou needest any

and all things. We know that Thou dwellest with him
and him alone who is of a sincere and holy mind ; -
that all places are alike sacred to Thee; —that where-
over two or three are gathered together in the name
of Jesus Christ, there Thou art present.
We believe that Thou hast constituted our moral
and religious nature to be susceptible of everlasting
improvement and advancement by exercise; that by
inattention to religious and moral discipline we
gradually lose that divine image in which we were
created. We believe that Thou hast so formed us,
that our highest happiness consists in worshipping
Thee, the Supreme Good, —that as we draw nigh to

ADDRESS.
My Christian Friends,— We have laid the founda-
tion stone of a house intended for the worship of the
one living and true God, through Jesus Christ.
This house is intended for the worship of the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God
of Moses, of David, of Isaiah; the God and the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is designed for
what we consider the oldest and the truest worship.
—for the worship of that one God which the Hebrews
adored till the coming of Christ: that same Almighty
Being which Jesus of Nazareth revealed as his God and
our God.
It is proposed that here should be taught a morality
and a piety as near as human weakness will admit
to that taught by our Saviour Jesus Christ. No
written creeds, no mysterious confessions, will be ex-
acted of those coming to worship here. The Bible,
and the Bible alone, will be the only standard of faith
and practice. * We think that therein is contained
everything necessary to salvation. We think, also,
that the Old and New Testament give not only the
highest and best revelation ever vouchsafed to man,

tual culture and beautifully adapted to the highest
moral elevation of the race.
This place of worship is not intended for a house of
controversy where every one that enters may expect to
hear denunciations of every one’s belief but our own.
It is not designed as a place where nothing is heard but
our denial of certain doctrines—where nothing is
heard but negations. We purpose quite the contrary.
We may consider it a conscientious duty to declare
sometimes in what points we consider other divi-
sions of the Christian Church to have departed from
what we consider the simplicity of the Gospel. But
we hope that these occasions will be exceptions. We
consider that our views of God and Christ, and duty,
and accountability, afford the finest field for positive
teaching.
We have not to defend any doctrine opposed to sound
and unprejudiced reason. We have no metaphysical
subtleties to explain at which “ reason stands aghast, and
faith itself is half confounded,” We have only to walk
right on, with the Bible in our hands, teaching us that
we are all over-canopied by a Being of infinite wisdom

peace, and immortality, in true consonance with the
revelation which God has given to man in his own soul
and conscience, as well as in the external world
around us.

simplicity and freedom from mystery- —from their being
expressed everywhere in the language of scripture,

occupations have not afforded them much time for
study. AV e think they are adapted well to them; and
we think that the system of interpretation which had

must be ntted to meet the wants of the human soul
in its most cultivated state; that it must be well
suited to satisfy all those hopes of eternal life which

in this colony, or these colonies, for the worship of one
God, the Father, through Jesus Christ, allow me, on
this, to us, most solemn occasion, one word of warning.
I warn those who have been in the habit of attending
Unitarian places of worship, and those who may join
us now, that these view's of Gcd, of duty, of man
and his destiny, however beautiful, true, scriptural,
and excellent they may appear, can do nothing
for them held a>s a mere theory; that if they ex-
pect from them any of the natural and legitimate effects
and advantages I have mentioned, without the public
or private exercise of religion, they will be greviously
disappointed. Without attention to moral <uid reli-
gious discipline, I do believe they will find the whole
moi’al and religious tone of their minds sink. One by
one will their better dispositions fade away. Their
benevolence, their purity, their philanthrophy, their
reverence for God, will all begin to wane, and the result
will be moral and religious death.
Such -conduct will only end with disgrace to them-
selves, and disgrace to the principles they have professed.
They will have done their part to retard for a while the


lent, truly honourable and honoured in this world, and
to give them such deeply grounded faith in Christ and

glory, honour, and immortality in another world, that

doctrines to have their fair and legitimate influence
on our whole walk and conversation. Without this
they will be only as sounding brass and a tinkling

I believe they will confer on us all the happiness on

that they will bring to us a glory in a future life which

very air is impregnated with the spirit and principles
of Channing and Dewey—where some of the greatest
names of that country are associated with our prin-
ciples; to them who have come from the north of
England or the north-east of Ireland; —to all these, it
would, in the course of a few months’ residence, have


appeared wonderfully strange that there was no place
where those simple, rational, scriptural views of Chris-
tianity were preached.
Yet, had they come out one year sooner, they might
have attended all the churches in the city and colony,
and they could not have easily collected from their
ministrations that there ever had been such a division
of the Christian church in existence. Ilarely would
they have met an individual in private society to have
confessed himself one of the unrecognised creed.
There was silence almost as deep as death. The whole
religious world of this colony seemed occupied by Cal-
vinism and Catholicism. These were in fierce and
strong antagonism to each other; and, to the more
liberal minded, there were no green spots left between
these two hot burning sands.
It is only those who have been here some years that
can understand how novel a work to this city is that
in which we have been engaged. Though we are not
a numerous body; yet our commencement in a country
where we were almost unheard of before, must excite
some attention to our principles. Our church, though
little, is set upon a hill. Our doctrines, though to us
most natural, simple, and scriptural, must appear
almost like a new revelation to those who have heard
nothing but the Athanasian Creed and Westminster
Confession. Some of us who were once Trinitarians
can remember what a new and divine light seemed to
dawn on us when first we read the works of Dr.
Chauning.

A moment’s reflection on these things will suggest
to all of us who are interested in the success of the


principles we profess, how worthy of consideration are
the words of my text. “ Let your light so shine before
men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
your Father which is in heaven/’ There is not
one of us whose conduct will not, in some degree,
retard or further the diffusion of our doctrines.
There is not a moral virtue nor a social virtue but
will be agents in promulgating and establishing our
faith. Patriotism, philanthrophy, benevolence, civility,
courteousness, all serve to recommend them; and we
need not say that temperance, truthfulness, holiness,
and justice, are the only tests of their worth or truth.
No wealth, no social position, no power of preaching,
can do anything without these. These are the mission-
aries which no bigotry, no worldly interest, no ignorance
can long resist; these are the only preachers. So
much of these as we possess, just so far and no
farther can we go. If you could measure or calculate
the height and depth and breadth of these qualities in
our hearts, you could tell even now the whole extent
of our influence for years to come.
We are then peculiarly called upon to walk worthily
of our high vocation. It has been for many "years my
firm conviction that it only requires a consistently re-
ligious and moral life in its professors to make our
religious views almost universal. I have had a wide and
long acquaintance with orthodox men and orthodox
writers. 1 believe there are few of the more intelligent
who dare trust themselves to read Channing or Dewey.

the general tenor of the Bible—the confusion of three

idea of God dying on the Cross—the entire absence of
such an idea as a triune God, not only from the pages of
the Old Testament, but from the mind of every Hebrew
who read it from the time of Abraham till the time of
Paul.
These points, when they do allow their minds to think
on them, cause great perplexity. If they had not a
large traditionary literature of the darker ages, as well
as the modern creeds to refer to, they never could retain
them. The march of intellect would most undoubted-
ly sweep them all away. But there is one reason which
makes them cling to these tenements, however frail,
however unsightly. They are afraid, if they permit the
unintelligible but revered mysteries to go, all religion,
all morality will go with them. They are waiting to
see if Uuitarianism can produce a pure morality, and a
fervent piety. If it could do that, they would not hold
their contradictory creeds for a day. Now, Ido believe
that this is the state of mind of a most influential num-
ber in almost all the churches around us.
And does it not read to us a good lesson ? It does coun-
sel to let our light so shine before men that they may see
our good works, and thereby adopt our views,—and
thereby, as we think, glorify our Father in heaven.
All the best men of all churches have a large share of
moral and religious life; and rather than see the exis-
tence and the culture of these sink, they would join
any society, however it might hold some views which
seemed to them irrational. They can neither live nor
die without religion. If they cannot get it in a lovely,
rational form, they must adhere to it in a more de*
formed aspect.

Your lives, then, will be as much inquired into as
your doctrines. The question will be asked, have
those views of Christianity power to malce their pro-
fessors assemble together every Sunday, in order tliar
they may hear them—in order that all the virtue they
enjoin may be more deeply engraved on their minds.
If they have not the power to make them attend to
either public or private devotion, the world will say, we
have no concern in further inquiries ; —they must be
barren and unfruitful. So it is with the whole ot the
wide range of social and Christian duties. Ihese social
and Christian duties are bound up by religion with an
indissoluble chain to the throne ot God. I know there
are individuals who say, that if a man live a good moral
life there is no occasion for piety, for devotion, for
religious exercises, either public or private. I think
this is a fatal error; because I do not believe that
morality will remain strong, and pure, and active in
the mind of him who forgets God and neglects his
worship.
J know of no system of religion, either among the
ancient Pagans, the Maliommedans, or the Christians,
which ever supposed they could preserve the moral and
the social virtues without the adoration of the higher
powers. Religion and piety are the links that hold
man to the great spiritual fountain —God. Break
those bonds, and he wanders forth without any com-
munication between him and the Source of all his life.
To expect him 1 then to manifest philauthrophy, kind-
ness, truthfulness, is to expect, the river to flow on
when its source is dried up.

How from religion directly or indirectly. Sometimes
we see an individual with apparently a low manifesta-
tion of religion, deficient in reverence and piety, yet
exhibiting much humanity and benevolence; —but I
think you will often find that he had parents, or
friends, or companions, of strong religious sense ; that
he inherited the same; and that, under his own or
their devotional feeling, his moral sense was sheltered
and fostered in his youth.
I have known an individual at the age of twenty,
of fine moral powers and a fine intellectual de-
velopment of mind, who certainly was deficient in
reverence and devotion : but through the habit of his
family always going to church or chapel—through
hearing religious subjects much examined and dis-
cussed, he never fell into that gross lethargic state
into which some do who give up public worship. Me
was, at this age, foremost in every good work. If the
poor were to be helped, to be educated, there he was
with his money and his exertions. If the cause of the
oppressed ever came before him, he was sure to be
the foremost to take that side, whether it were the
question of the dark slave abroad, or that of the white
man down-trodden at home. Yet, from a fear of super-
stition from a dread lest he should be considered
rather submissive, or not independent enough, if he
were found bowing down with the great body of man-
kind, to confess the almighty power of God; —or
whether it were the very small religious nature he
possessed,—however, by degrees he withdrew from
public worship—from any religious exercises, private
or public,—and gradually did his patriotism, his

Now, this I do take to be an example in point. You
may, no doubt, know of something to the contrary;
but I think this one individual shews the tendency of
allowing religion to go down, of permitting our devo
tional feelings to die nut. I have no confidence in what
the person may become after he has fallen away from
the belief in, and the worship of, God. I would exhort
you, then, to keep close to the spirit, the teaching, the
guidance of Jesus of Nazareth; for he is the way, the
truth, and the life, to lead you to the knowledge and
love of the only living and true God. It is good, apt
excellent, and profitable to find out and hold firmly by
the most true and excellent interpretation of the
scriptures. We consider we have found out that. We
think there can be no religious belief that recommends
itself so fully and completely to the moral, to the
intellectual, and to the religious nature of man, as
that which inculcates the supreme adoration and
entire love of one God, eternal, immortal, invisible,
without variableness or shadow of turning; which keeps
the mind engaged in devotion, in prayer, and hr praise,
from being confused with three persons being one, and
all claiming equal homage and equal dominion.
But what can this do, with all its excellence, its
grandeur, its scripturality, if the professor walk about
day after day without ever thinking of that supreme
goodness and perfect beauty—if he have lost that moral
and religious perception by which alone he can recog-
nise his God—if that image of his Maker be almost
effaced from his soul. There can no light shine from

Christ, from His examples, from His depth of sp ritual
power, that a similar power must be excited in us.
He has the words of eternal life. If you leave Him for
superstition and creeds, if you leave Him for the wide
wastes of infidel philosophy, you will miss your aim ot
that perfect man which is formed by Christ Jesus. The
superstition makes you in some degree ugly and de-
formed like itself. It must leave its own image sooner
or later on your heart which embraces it- If you adopt
an absurd, superstitious creed, its consequences and evil
effects will be seen in the third and the fourth genera-
tion after you. You cannot sincerely embrace any
doctrine without its consequences. So, likewise, with the
infidel or irreligious philosophy. In it the soul has no
anchor to cling to when tempests arise. The infidel
has no standard of human perfection, like Christ, to
follow ; nor has he any standard of morality,like the para-
bles, or the sermon on the mount, to flee to, in the days of
despair, affliction or death. That individual has to
wander over an illimitable desert without a star to guide

simple. It opens up infinite hopes :it keeps you calm
and steady under the wings of Almighty power and
goodness. If you leave that rock you will never again
find rest for the soles of your feet.

before he reaches his destination. But the sincere'
follower of Christ has no windings to make. He is
never led out of the straight path. Awake, asleep, at
home, abroad, he is surrounded still with God. In
obedience to the morality of Jesus, light arises all
around you. His teachings touch all the moral and
religious well-springs in your soul. These well-springs,
then, are now the enjoyment, and the beginning of
that kingdom of heaven which is to have no end.
It is under this same guidance and shelter that any
light can shine from you to help others on in the road
of virtue and godliness. When you depart from Him,
no moral light appears from you. It is from nearness
to Him that all good works spring ; and it is by these
good works that we can glorify our Father which is in
heaven. Every thing else is means to produce these
good works. Prayer and praise, the life and teachings
of Christ, are all for this one end. Why should we
now attempt to erect a place of worship, or assemble
ourselves together, but that the character of Christ
may be brought frequently before our consciences and
understandings, convinced that without Him we have
no guide, no steady light to the one only living and
true God ; convinced that without an abiding sense of
the presence of that God, there is no happiness,
honour, or satisfaction, either now or for ever. Let
us, then, worship this God, through Jesus Christ, with
all our heart, and soul, and strength. May we feel
that this is the only way to obtain that light which
should shine before men, that they may see our good
works, and glorify our Father which is in heaven.—•
Amen.

good works that we can glorify our Father which is in
heaven. Every thing else is means to produce these
good works. Prayer and praise, the life and teachings
of Christ, are all for this one end. Why should we
now attempt to erect a place of worship, or assemble
ourselves together, but that the character of Christ
may be brought frequently before our consciences and
understandings, convinced that without Him we have
no guide, no steady light to the one only living and
true God ; convinced that without an abiding sense of
the presence of that God, there is no happiness,
honour, or satisfaction, either now or for ever. Let
us, then, worship this God, through Jesus Christ, with
all our heart, and soul, and strength. May we feel
that this is the only way to obtain that light which
should shine before men, that they may see our good
works, and glorify our Father which is in heaven.—•
Amen.
