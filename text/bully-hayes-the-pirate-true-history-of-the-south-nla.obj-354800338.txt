Louis Becke was born on June 17, 1857,
on which day Hayes was in Fremantle,
master of the C. W. Bradley. On Sep-
tember 27, 1874, the day Becke last saw
Hayes, and when Hayes bolted from
Strong’s Island, Becke was therefore
only 17 years and 3 months old. Becke
was a romancer with a picturesque imagi-
nation. He claimed to have met Hayes
in San Francisco a.bout seven years before
Hayes was last seen by him, and at this
lime Becke was not 11 years old.
The fact is that Beeke knew Hayes,
but for less than 12 months, for only two
months of which time, from January 16,
1874, to March 16, 1874, was Becke on
board the Leonora, she having been wreck-
ed on the lastmentioned date. From
which time to September, 1874, Becke was
living with Hayes at South Harbour,
Strong’s Island. Louis exploited his ac-
quaintance with Hayes to his utmost, and
claimed to have cruised for 18 months
with the Bully in the Leonora, which was
untrue.
When the ronmnce which Becke and
Boldrewood wrapped round Hayes is torn
away, he is found to be a vile ruffian, who
injured and defrauded every _ one who
trusted him. He was a- plausible scoun-
drel, of no education, and was well named
“Bully,” as he used his enormous strength
and fistic science to bully, browbeat, and
plunder weaker men. His treatment of
women, especially of the coloured races,
was brutal and shocking, and at least one
case must have been well known to
Becke, as the Queensland “Government
Gazette” of August 28, 1875, proves.
In Sydney in January of 1860, Hayes
was charged at the police court with in-
decent assault on a passenger of his brig,
the Ellenita, on the high seas, but as there
was no corroboration of the evidence of
the 17-year-old girl the case was dismissed.
In New Zealand, about five years after,
lie tried to abduct and ruin another
young girl of 17, and only failed through
the girl’s firmness and courage.
His practice in the South Seas was to
call at a remote island and compel the
chief to send cocoanuts, girls, and female
children of tender years on board Ms ves-
sel, and in two cases his violation, with
great brutality, of children of 10 years
or under is proved.
It is also proved that he married a
widow in Adelaide in 1857, took her away,
and deserted her, had another wife, in
1863 in Newcastle a.nd New Zealand,
where he drowned her and her child, ac-
cidentally he claimed, and yet another
wife, “Mrs. Mary Emily Hayes, now re-
siding (1874) at Samoa,” to quote from
bis instructions to Becke. This is the
man-who was Becke’s friend, and the man
whom Boldrewood glorified in his “Mod-
ern Buccaneer.” Boldrewood did not write
in ignorance when he wrote a,s follows on
page 197:—“I will here make a quotation
from the Queensland ‘Government Ga-
zette,’ which, like the apparatus, cannot
lie, but Boldrewood did not quote from
the “Gazette.” What he did was to
garble the “Gazette” and misquote from
it.
In no instance can I find that Hayes
failed to take advantage of any trust re-
posed in him. When his brig, the Ellen-
ita, was wrecked and he landed at Samoa,
he met a down-cast Yankee shipmaster,
and got £6O out of him, promising to
make him master of a ship which Hayes
said was in Port Adelaide, and which he
owned. In January. 1860, he was charged
by the Yankee shipmaster before the
Sydney Police , Court with obtaining this
money by false pretences, but the ease
was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. In
1858 Hayes bolted from Adelaide, a fugi-
tive insolvent, and in 1860 in Sydney he
also declared himself insolvent.


In Western Australia, he, Parkinson, and
B. L. Baker, who came from Singapore
with him, got at Mr. Yelverton, of the
Vasse, for a cargo of timber, wheel hubs,
&c., and soon after Mr. Yelverton, Mr.
Heppingstone, and other Yasse people
were heavily fined for smuggling, they be-
ing fellow-passengers from Fremantle to
the Vasse with B. F. Baker in the Estrel-
la-do-Norte, which vessel was in Hayes’s
hands, and was loaded with timber at the
Yasse.
The subjoined extracts are from the
Queensland “Government Gazette,” pages
1,672 to 1,678, and can be seen in the Perth
Public Library. Hayes’s letters were
usually written by others and only signed
by him, but as Becke was on board the
Rosario when the following letters were
written Hayes had to write them himself,
and thus leave a record of his ignorance.
H.M. Ship Rosario, at Sea.
October 10, 1874.
Sir —With reference to Mr. Hayes, mas-
ter of the American brig Leonora, I beg
to forward the following statement of
facts relative to him that I have been
able to collect among the different islands
visited during the present cruise of H.M.
ship under my command.
1. There can be no doubt that Mr.
Hayes is a most unprincipled but shrewd
man, one who has (I now have no doubt)
committed many shocking acts of violence
on the natives, and to say the least of
them been guilty of many of dishonesty
towards other persons, yet so clever is
he in methods of proceeding, and so much
has his name got to be feared by both
natives and white residents on the islands,
that, though it was evident that at nearly
all the islands I visited he was well
known, yet it was impossible to find out
much about him or his deeds. I was per-
fectly convinced that nearly the "whole of
the whites and natives were afraid to
speak out.
2. With regard to Mr. Daly’s business,
what evidence I could get was rather in
Hayes’s favour, and tended to show that
Daly’s agents at the different islands had
sold the trade to Hayes, instead of Hayes
stealing it.
3. On leaving the Marshall Group for
Providence Island I felt that my case
against Hayes was very weak, that I
had gained no evidence worth mentioning
against him, and that if I found him on
Providence Island I could hardly arrest
him. _At Providence Island I heard the
first direct evidence against him in a case
of shockingly brutal treatment of a youno-
- whom he brought from the island of
Pingelap (see statement of Henry Gar-
diner, American).
4. On entering Chabral Harbour
(Strong’s _ Island) Mr. Hayes (as I have
reported in my letter of proceedings) came
out to meet the ship in a boat. He told
me that his vessel had been wrecked in
South Harbour of this island on March 1
this year, and that since he had been liv-
ing on shore and collecting oil.
Living on shore was Mr. Snow (Ameri-
can missionary), who had just arrived
from Ebon Island, and numerous white
men, part of the crew of the late vessel
Leonora, part-residents on the islands.
In harbour was a schooner under the Ger-
man flag, Mr. Milne (an Englishman),
master.
5. I commenced .making enquiries as
quickly and as quietly as I could about
Hayes, but here, as at other places, I met
with the same disinclination from all par-
ties to tell anything they might know.
Mr. Milne, though hinting that Hayes had
robbedi him not long since, would at first
say nothing, nor was it till after consider-
able persuasion and the delay of some
days that 1 got the enclosed statement,
with the evidence of various witnesses in
the matter, from him. But as he was
sailing under German colours I could not
believe my duty was to do more than re-
ceive his statement and forward it through
you to the German Consul at Sydney. I
also accidentally heard of another case of
rape andi shocking cruelty on the person
of a young native girl, and satisfied myself
of its correctness. The king or chief of
the place, through Mr. Snow, also told me
he should like me to remove Haves from
his island, as he was afraid of him.
Hayes, alarmed by hearing from some
of his crew of the enquiries that had been
made, left the island in a boat on the
night of the _27th, taking one man with
him. His design was, I believe, either to
make the Island of Bouabi (Ascension)
or Pingelap (MeCaskill).
6. At their own request, and also con-
sidering it a good thing to rid the island
of them, I took five of the crew of the
Leonora on board for passage to Sydney,
and one other (Louis Beck) who had been
a passenger on board, and from what I
could hear a great friend of Hayes. This
Beck was the person who had been sent
by Mr. Williams, British Consul at
Samoa,f as supercargo of the ketch that
I met at Milli (reported in the letter of
proceedings), but, leaving his charge there,
he had gone to sea with Hayes, and had
been with him since January. I con-
sidered it desirable that he should be re-
moved, there being no chance of his vet-
ting back to Milli from Strong Island-
also because the chief particularly urged
his removal as a man likely to stir up
much trouble in the island. These six
persons are now on board.
7. I visited Mr. Hayes’s residence at
South Harbour; he had made a regular
settlement of _ it, and had collected a large
quantity of oil. Ho less than five voting
women or girls were living in his house,
who had all, with one exception, been
living on board the Leonora with him.
That vessel was sunk in fourteen fathoms,
topmastead a few feet above water.

8. The first mate. I left on. the island,
recommending him to take charge of
Hayes’s property. The second mate ran
away into the bush just before I sailed,
and could not be found, or I should have
taken him to Sydney with the others.
9. Thinking the case over quietly after-
wards, I cannot see how I could have ar-
rested Hayes. It is therefore with re-
gret that I am obliged to report my fail-
ure to collect sufficient evidence against
him to warrant my doing so. The case
of Mr. Daly’s must have failed for want
of such evidence.
Mr. Milne’s case was one against a
Herman subject. The cases of cruelty to
the native girls could have been proved,
I think; but I considered it would have
been exceeding my instructions to appre-
hend an American subject on such
charges, and being doubtful whether the
Sydney law would have been able to deal
with such cases. Enclosed is a list of the
crew of the brig Leonora, also several let-
ters and statements relative to Hayes
that I collected at Strong Island.

Rev. Mr. Snow to Oa.pt. Dupuis.
Strong’s Island, or Kusaie,
December 26, 1871.
Dear Sir —I am happy to comply
with your request concerning a letter
from me -as an American citizen in regard
to Capt. W. H. Hayes, who is' -also a citi-
zen of the United States of America..
I have known the said Hayes personally
for a few years past, but have_ known
much more of him by reports, which have
almost invariably been greatly to his dis-
credit, or, as you Englishmen would say,
be has the reputation of being “a. very
clever rogue.” I have hoped that a
brighter nhase might open up to his cha-
racter from some source, but I have look-
ed in vain.
Having heard that his vessel was wreck-
ed on this island, the field of my earlier
missionary labours, I availed myself of
the earliest -opportunity of getting here,
that I might render such assistance by my
presence and counsel as might be needed.
The prospect of meeting you here in your
man-of-war capacity was -another very
strong inducement for me to come at this
time, feeling assured that you would feel
only too glad in adjusting any matters
that might need such force and authority
as you have at your -command. And I am
sorry to- find that your presence is very
timely in the -case of this Capt. Hayes-
“sorry,” for I would fain have found such
a state of things as might not require ye-m-
-aid.
Having -been on this island a week, what
I can learn of said Hayes only confirms •
yea, even strengthens —previous evil re-
ports I have heard of him, so that I am
constrained to -say, in all sincerity, amd in
the interest of our common humanity, that
you will be doing a most praiseworthy act
by taking him on board the .Rosario, and
taking him to Sydney, where he may be
brought under the cognisance and juris-
diction of -civil law.
I am fully a.ware of the -difficulty and
delicacy of your situation in thus proceed-
ing with a -citizen of -a foreign Power,
but I think I can assure you, as a citizen
of the United States, that our Govern-
ment would gladly make common cause
with our cousins across the water in ar-
resting -au-d bringing to justice such out-
laws as this said Capt. Hayes has so long
had the reputation of being. Of course I
cannot speak officially, but my firm con-
victions are that the course you contem-
plate in taking him to Sydney and deliver-
ing him up to the American authorities
there will not only be approved but ap-
plauded. It will certainly relieve our
Micron-esian seas of one of the greatest
sources of annoyance we have had during
the 20 and more years I have been a
resident missionary on these islands.
You will allow me to make kindly a,nd
grateful mention of the visit of H.M. ships
Barrosa and Blanche, from whose com-
manders and officers myself and associates
received very kind and gentlemanly atten-
tions.
Long live your noble Queen, and long
may there exist peace and the most_ fra-
ternal goodwill between our two national
Governments.
I remain, &c.,

Henry Gardiner, an American by birth,
statesln the year 1871 I engaged with
Mr. Hayes, master of the brig Leonora,
to go to Providence Island and collect
oil and any other produce the island
afforded for him.

About July, 1872, while living on shore,
Hayes came there in his vessel. He had
a young Pinjelap girl on board with him,
and one day he brought her on shore and
took her into the bush. . About half an
hour afterwards I saw the girl coming
out of the bush. (What follows is unfit
for publication.) I afterwards enquired
from the women, and they told me that
he had had intimacy with her, using great
violence. I should say the girl was about
10 years old.
I hereby solemnly declare and swear
that the above is a true statement.
HENRY GARDINER.
We went to the Island of Pinjelap
about the month of March and laid off.
Mr. Hayes went on shore and came on
board with the chief. He kept him down
in the cabin in charge of the second mate,
and sent the natives who had come with
the chief on shore to bi'ing off 7,000 co-
coanuts and two girls, saying that the
chief should not go on shore till he
(Hayes) had got thorn, and that if they
were not sent on board the chief should
bo taken to Samoa. About 5,000 nuts and
one girl were brought on board. We then
left the islands.
The above is a true statement.
N. NAHNSEN.
Emma, an Ocean Island girl, came to
•Strong Island in a whale ship about six
months ago. Several others came in the
game ship. Mr. Hayes on coming to this
island took her to his house and asuault-
ed her; he used most brutal violence, and
the girl bled very much. This was about
two or three months ago; the girl is not
recovered yet, and can hardly walk. The
staff surgeon’s (of the Rosario) oninion is
that she cannot be more than 8 or 9 years
old. A Pinjelap called Beloza actually
saw the assault committed, and described
it as being brutal in the extreme.
The above statement was made in our
presence.

John Carstens, a German, states:—l
was one of the crew of the brig Leonora
some time early in February this year.
About the month of March in this year
Mr. Hayes, in tfye Leonora, Avent to the
Island of Pinjelap, hove to, and the cap-
tain went on shore and brought the chief
on board. He took the chief down to
the cabin, and after dinner came on deck,
leaving the chief doivn in the cabin in
charge of the second mate. He sent the
natives on shore, telling them to bring off
5.000 cocoanuts and tvo women, or else
he Avould not let the chief go on shore
again. The natives brought off betAveen
3.000 or 4.000 cocoanuts and one girl. The
girl was crying, and did not want to come.
Hayes then let the chief go on shore, and
we sailed for Strong Island.
The above is a true statement.
(Signed) F. A. CARSTENS.
William Hicks, half-caste Fiji man,
states :
I was second mate of the Leonora. I
was three years in that vessel. About
March we went to Pinjelap Island, hove
to, and Hayes went on shoxe. Came on
board bringing a chief, or rather two.
After dining he sent one on shore to tell
the natives to bring 7,000 cocoa nuts on
board and two girls. The other chief he
kept in the cabin, and told me not to let
him go on deck. The natives brought
between 5,000 and 6,000 cocoanuts and one
girl, and then Hayes let the chief go.
About two and a half years ago he got
a young girl from Pinjelap, took her on
slioi't at Providence Island, and violently
assaulted her and ravished Uer. The
girl cried out, and was much hurt. She
was taken on board the ship, where she
was for about two and a half months,
and was then taken bank to Pinjelap,
The girl was very young, quite a child.
I have known him treat other young girls
the same.
The abovp is a true statement.

she came on board, did not want to go.
Some time ago, about tw r o years, Hayes
took a young Pinjelap girl to Providence

Memorandum of Instructions for Mr.
Luis G. Becke.
Sir —As I am about to leave Strong’s
Island, and have given you poAver to act
in my behalf, I want you to use every
care to close up all my affairs in. the best
manner you can. In regard to the pro-
perty I leave behind, you will look after
and dispose of the same to the best ad-
vantage. The remainder of the oil after
you pay yourself for the chronometer,
and Mr. Harry Skillings for the trade I
had from him, and also for making 35|
barrels of oil at 2 dollars per barrel,
you will then sell the balance as soon as
an opportunity occurs, also the empty
casks, the large cargo boat, and all my
pigs, together with any and everything
that is saleable. Anything that you can-
not sell give to the people that have been
kind to you, and the natives. Out of the
proceeds of the sale of my property you
will pay the passage of my natives to
Samoa,, if they want to there; if not,
see them back on their OAvn island, or some
other island of the Kingsmill Group, that
they may get with their OAV.n country
people. My boy Toby 1 want you to take
to Samoa and look after him as Avell
as you can, and give him to my wife, also
Kitty, as they ba,ve no father or mother,
and both were given me by the king
of the Hope Island, or rather the head
man, as there has been no king since
the old one died. The stores I left be-
hind are for you and the natives
to li\ T e on until yon can get
aAvay. The little trade I leave you, you
will be careful of it and make the most
of it, for you know the Strong Islanders
want payment for everything yon get of
them to eat. You will bear in mind that
the king owes me 10 barrels of oil for the
lavo tripots, also there are tAvo head of
cattle that belong to me; the large bull
I give the king as payment for alloAving
the other two to run on the island until I
could dispose of or ship them. Sell them,
if yon can, to the king or Mr. Snow, as
you cannot get a chance to ship them; use
your own judgment in the matter, and
do the best you can. You will also bear
in mind that the king and chiefs owe me
12,100 (twelve thousand one hundred) eo-
coanuts, the balance of the item of 48,000
cocoanuts that they agree to pay to me
for the loss of my property stolen by
Strong Islanders at the time of the loss
of the brig Leonora.
I write you an accompanying letter to
each of my agents. You Avill have to
settle with them by their own accounts,
as my trade book was lost, as you are
aware of; after you have settled up you
Will please take the balance of money or
property and hand over the same to my
Avife, Mrs. Mary Emily Hayes, now resid-
ing at Samoa, as yon are aAvare of. Out
of this you will pay your own passage and
expenses and settle with Mrs. Hayes for
anything else yon may want to charge for
your trouble.' Wishing you every suc-
cass, and trusting you Avill arrive safely in
Samoa,
Believe me, &c.,

and maid servant were drowned in the
sinking of Mr. Askew’s yacht in a squall
in Croixelles Harbour on Friday, August
19. The particulars of the unfortunate ac-
cident were given in our paper last week.
There is little to add to the facts therein
reported. Mr. Mayo arrived at Croixelles
on Wednesday week, and up to Tuesday
evening was engaged in searching for the
bodies of the three persons wno had not
been found, and in taking official evi-
dence regarding the painful occurrence.
The names of the drowned persons are
—Mrs. Roma Hayes, aged 20; Adelaida
_udora Hayes, aged 13 months; George
Buckingham (not Collins, as first report-
ed), brother to Mrs. Hayes, aged 23; and
Mary Cowley, the maid servant, aged 15.
The body of the child, which was found
on the beach near the Boulder Banks,
was disinterred on Sunday in the pre-
cence of a number of witnesses. It had
scarcely begun to decompose, and, with
the exception of a slight graze on the
temple—quite a skin wound —there was
ho mark on the body. When the boat
sank, which she did instantly, the captain
seized the infant with one hand and his
wife with the other, while his brother-
in-law struck out for one of the islands.
Capt. Hayes called to him to take the
baby, but he apparently did not hear,
and by and by first one oar and then an-
other floated in the direction of the three,
;,nd enabled Cant. Hayes to keep up his
burden longer than he otherwise could
have done. The place he landed at was
very rugged, and he must while in a state
of mental insensibility have climbed over
a ruvged noint on the coast which inter-
vened between the spot at which he land-
ed and that where the ship was lying.
Under the police officer’s management
dragging was carried on around the spot
where the yacht sank, and diligent
search was made for days all round the
harbour, but without success. None of
the bodies has been found. The yacht
herself was raised by the crew of the
Black Diamond on Monday last, and m
it Avas found the coat of George Bucking-
ham. The hat of the maid and the cap
of Buckingham were found about the
same time as the body of the child was
discoA 7 ered. Before learning on Wednes-
day morning, Cant. Hayes left orders 10
continue to search the shores of the har-
bour, and send to Nelson immediately if
any of the bodies should be found. But
Ave fear after this lapse of time that there
is little likelihood of their being found.
At the request of Capt. Hayes, Ave print
the subjoined letter:

“ ‘To the Editor of the “Colonist.”
“ 'Dear Sir—l shoiild feel obliged if you
can insert a letter of thanks from me to
the settlers of the Croixelles, who assisted
me in a most kind and hospitable manner
after the unhappy and most lamentable
loss of my wife, child, brother, and ser-
vant during the late gale and upsetting
of our boat at the Croixelles.
‘The names of those I feel
grateful to are Air. and Airs. Alexander
Rankin and Air. Ale La ron, to whom I
shall feel for ever grateful for their kind
assistance rendered upon this occasion. -I
am, Sir, yours, &c., AY. H. Hayes, master
of the Black Diamond. Nelson, September
1, 1864.’”
On Friday, September 30. 1864, Capt.
Hayes was sued by James Pawson, a la-
bourer, for £l7, for payment of wages
due from August 19 to September 23, for
cutting firewood and for doing other work
on board the Black Diamond, and in con-
nection with that vessel AY. Turner, sea-
man and labourer, also sued for £l7, and
\Y. G. R. Holland for £7. Evidence for
olaintiffs was that they were engaged by
Hayes at 10/ per day and their food.
Hayes denied the terms of the bargain,
but it was proved by the men and the
second mate, who heard the agreement
made. The Bench deemed the claims ex-
cessive, and gave judgment in each_ case
for two-thirds of the amounts claimed.
The chief mate, John Till, sued the master
and owners of the Black Diamond on the
same day for £76 wages and cash lent
to the master (Hayes). The private debt
was struck out, and) after evidence (in the
course of which Hayes admitted that he
had falsified the log book by throwing
overboard the original book and writing a
new one after the seizure of the vessel
on behalf of the mortgagee), the owners
were found liable to the plaintiff in the
sum of £22 10/, being one-half of the
amount claimed, with costs.
On October 7 a letter appeared in the
“Colonist,” signed by AY. Turner, asking
how it was that a poor man in the pro-
vince of Nelson could not sret justice, and
stating that he had applied to the R.M.
to obtain a warrant for the arrest of
Hayes to prevent him absconding from the
colony until he paid him, on the ground's
that Hayes intended to sail by the Phoebe,
which he did on the Sunday morning, the
day after he had urged the Magistrate to
grant the warrant.

“THE NOTORIOUS CAPT. HAYES
AGAIN.
“A CASE OF ABDUCTION.”
“Our readers will remember the sad
story of a tragic occurrence which took
place in the Croixelles on August 19 last,
and which told of the sinking of Mr. As-
kew’s yacht and drowning of four out of
five persons who were on board of her.
These five were the notorious master of
the notorious schooner Black Diamond,
his wife, his brother-in-law (George Buck-
ingham, who belonged to a family of ac-
tors from Australia, and who had been
performing down south prior _to the con-
nection with Hayes), his infant child
(about a year old), and the maidservant.
Of these all were drowned by the sinking
of the yacht except Hayes. No human
eye but bis witnessed the accident, and
pathetic and melancholy enough was the
sade tale he told of how he bore his wife
on his shoulder while _ swimming, giving
her first the child to kiss ere he dropped
it drowned body, and at last, being
obliged to drop her also, after she had
ceased to breathe: how his brother-in-
law swam out to sea, and be saw him no
more; how the maid sank helplessly by
the boat; and how, after a terrible strug-
gle, he reached land almost insensible, the
ortly one left to tell the His deep
emotion when he recounted this incident
was painful to behold; but if it was deep,
then time appeared speedily to bring a
salve to his wounds, judging from the com-
fort he seemed to derive from open as-,
sociations of no equivocal nature. We
had thought that when Capt. Hayes left
this province for Australia, after hav-
ing yielded up his vessel to a band of
legalised captors, we had heard the last of
a strange character. But it appears not,
as the annexed somewhat high-flown nar-
rative from the ‘Marlborough Press’ of
Saturday last shows.”

BULLY HAYES.
A FEDERAL MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT
A SAILOR BOY WITH “BULLY” HAYES.
ON THE LOTUS WHEN HAYES WAS KILLED
When in Melbourne in the middle of
December, 1913, I not only found a, mine
of information in the Federal Parliamen-
tary Library and the Petherick Library
respecting Hayes, but also had an inter-
view with a Federal M.P., who
as a boy sailed from Singapore
with Hayes on Hayes’s last cruise, an i was
employed by him when Hayes was killed.
He naturally takes gv eat interest
in Hayes, has a mass of information re-
specting him, and has lectured on Fayes
and his life and doings. I am sure that
no merchantship master has caused as
much expense and trouble to the British
Government as Hayes. The Admiralty,
Foreign Office, Crown Law Office, Trea-
sury, Board of Trade, and the Colonial
Office for about 10 years expended time,
trouble, and money on Hayes, and reams
of paper were used in despatches,
minutes, and enquiries respecting him. I
have now examined all papers issued by
the British Government that I can find
any trace of.
In 1862 Hayes seems to have chartered
a vessel, the Cincinatti, to carry passen-
gers to the Otago (Hew Zealand) gold-
fields, to which thousands of Australians
were then going, and the fololwing tele-
gram appeared in the Melbourne “Age”
of September 9. 1862, from Sydney:—“The
notorious Capt. Hayes, with the barque
Cincinatti, visited Sydney, and after en-
gaging passengers for Dunedin and receiv-
ing their passage money, sailed away with-
out a single passenger.” The Otago “Daily
Times” of September 24, 1862. says —“With
reference to a Sydney telegram in a Mel-
bourne paper. Capt. Hayes says that the
Sydney passengers referred to had declin-
ed to accept the accommodation which
it was originally agreed they should have
aboard the Cincinatti.”
The following are extracts, from British
Blue Books for the years 1868 to 1872:
The brig Pioneer, in which Hayes escaped
from Apia, was originally the Waterlily
of Aberdeen, and when Hayes got pos-
session of her was put under the American
flag, renamed by Hayes the Leonora, and
was wrecked on Strong’s Island in March,
1874.
From Consul G. C. Miller, Tahiti. De-
cember 16, 1868:—“Up to Decern be* 16,
1868, there has been introduced by the
brig Kona, W. H. Hayes master, about
150 natives of Niue, or Savage Island.
These are employed on Tahiti, or Moorea,
and have not to my knowledge complain-
ed of having been deceived or ill-treated
during the voyage hither.”
Extract from letter from Rev. W. Lawes
to Rev. G. Morris, from Niue, or Savage
Island, October 20, 1868: —“Oapt. Hayes is
here in the Kona, waiting icr his schooner
the Samoa, daily expected from Samoa.
The Kona is going to Samoa and will call
here on her way to Tahiti for a cargo of
pigs. Pigs are the secondary object the
primary one, I believe, is a cargo of men
and women. The women. Capt- Hayes
himself says, he stole.”
From Consul John C. MJilliams to the
Earl of Clarendon: —“Apia. Samoa, March
4. 1870. —On December 24, 1869 the
schoner Atlantic arrived here in charge
of the mate (Hussey) from Tutuila. with
despatches from Mr. Hunkin, saying that
the Atlantic had been seized by the chief
of Pago Pago Harbour for the master,
W. H. Hayes, had been charged with kid-
napping people from Manihiki. or Hum-
phreys Island. I proceeded to Tutuila
and brought the master Hayes, to Apia,
arriving January 9, 1870. From the evi-
dence I am convinced that the Manihikans
were kidnapped. The following is a sum-
mary of the facts. The Atlantic, Hayes
master, arrived at Manihiki on November
12, 1869, when Hayes agreed to tako the
Manahikins to Rakahana. or Recisions Is-
land, where they were going on a friendly
visit, with 20,000 cocoanuts and hats and
mats, as present to Rakahana people.
Thev arrived at Puka Puka, when the
Manihikans were ordered down the hold
8


and the hatches closed, and had no inter-
course with any one from Puka Puka.
Hayes engaged some of the Puka Puka
people as laborers for Samoa. It is a
clear case of kidnapping, and piracy. The
difficulty I am in is how I can send Hayes
and the schooner to Sydney. There is no
one in Apia who would risk himself with
such a man as Hayes- He told me he
would never go to Sydney. His character
is well known in all the ‘olonies, China,
San Francisco and other parts of the
world.”
Consul Williams to Lord Clarendon:
“Apia. April 1, 1870. —I have to report
that W. H. Hayes, prisoner on parole,
bands in the brig Pioneer A Shanghai, B.
has this day made his escape out of my
Pease, an American, master. The Pio-
neer is bound for Ascension and the Mar-
shall Group. The Atlantic is still in my
possession.”
Board of Trade, London. September 15,
1870. —The Board are unable to trace
Hayes as holding a certificate of com-
petency or service in the British mer-
chant service, and they have consequently
no means whatever of calling him to ac-
count for his proceedings
Board of Trade, Whitehall, December
21, 1870. Re Cant. Hayes, of the Athntic.
“The Board of Trade directed the ' egis-
trar of seamen to note this case with a
view to report the appearance of Cant.
Hayes if he should ever be found ( ymg
on board a British vessel.’
Consul Williams to Earl
“Apia. Qetobe 3, 1870- —1 reported to
you, April 3. 1870, that W. H. Hayce had
escaped on April 1, 1870. in the British
brig Pioneer, Ben Pease, an American,
master. I have now to report the pro-
ceedings of Mr Ben Pease in these seas.
The Pioneer is heavily armed with guns
and breech-loading rifles and carries a
large crew. After leaving Apia the Pio-
neer preceded to Savage Blands, and by
- of a forged order obtained £3OO
worth of produce owned by J. & T. Skin-
ner, Sydney. lam informed that Pease
lands an armed party on any island v. here
he can find cocoanut oil. and with his
armed crew takes it off to his vessel In
this manner he is Prowin,' about these
seas, carrying on his piracies. In the
matter of the Atlantic incident I laid my-
self open to an action, but W. H. Bayes
making bis escape clears me and proves bis
guilt.”
Commander Challis to Commodore Sth
ling:—“Rosario. October 10 1870.—1 arriv-
ed at Apia on September 27. 1870, and at
once communicated with Mr. Williams,
British Consul, re the kidnaprune of the
natives of Humphreys Island by W H.
Hayes, master of tbe schooner Atlantic,
and find there is little doubt that the
people were taken awav by Hayes under
false nretences as stated.”
Detective Office, Sydney. Nbvmnbei 29,
1871.— “ Detective Richard Elliott reports
that William Henry Hayes was born in
Cleveland, Ohio, and that the ton part
of Hayes’s right ear was bitten off some
years ago, but it is not observable• the
hair covers the mutilated part.”
Report of Mr. Rothery to British Trea-
surer re Atlantic and W. H. Hayes:
■’Doctors Commons, October 15, 1870. I
have perused and considered the docu-
ments relative to the Atlantic and W. H.
Hayes. The circumstances are:—ln Sep-
tember, 1869, Hayes, whose character
seems to have been well known in these
seas, was at Apia, when he was applied
to by F. H. Severight to provide labour-
ers. Hayes ,a.t that time was without a
vessel, having lost the ship which he had
owned, but soon after obtained from Bet-
ham & Moore, of Apia, the command of
the schooner Atlantic, and sailed on Oc-
tober 12, 1869. with Severight on beard.
On November 12 they sighted Manihiki,
and there Capt. Hayes, a woman who
lived with him on board his vessel, Mary
Jordan, her brother, Joseph Jordan, who
acted as interpreter, and -Severight, land-
ed. The same night the Atlantic drifted
out to sea, and it was eight days before
she again fetched the land. Meantime
Hayes, the Jordans, and Severight were
lodged in the house of the native mis-
sionary, and, having learned that the is-
landers wished to go to Rakahana with
some cocoa-nuts, hats, and mats as pre-
sents to the Rakahanians. Capt. Hayes
proposed to take them over without any
charge, and to return them after they
had seen their friends. He also pro-
posed that the whole settlement should
go—men, women, and children. Before,
however, the return of the Atlantic Capt.
Hayes had excited the suspicions of the
islanders by his having deflowered a. child
of tender years, and his evident anxiety
to get the whole of the female portion
of the settlement aboard, but it was pro-
posed by the elders that the women and
girls should remain behind, and only males
should go. Ha.yes strongly objected to
this, saying it would not look well for
the men to go without the women, but
all his efforts to get the females to go on
boaid failed. However, he got aboard
20,000 oocoanuts and some bats and mats,
and made a last effort to induce the na-
tives to come on board, and with that
view he sent the dinghy owned by the
missionary teacher ashore to persuade
the people to come and receive payment
for the goods. In an hour or two the
dinghy returned with a native boat, in
which were two little girls, eight boys, one
middle-aged woman, and several old men.
When Hayes found he could not persuade
any more natives to come aboard he told
Joseph Jordan to take the two little girls
and eight boys into the cabin, and en-
deavoured to persuade the elderly natives
to return to the shore in their boat.
This they seemed very unwilling to do
without their children, but at length all
the old people were got into the native
boat except the old man Moete and the


woman, both of whom had children on
board, and consequently refused to leave.
The Atlantic then stood out to sea, and
Hayes then for the first time told the
natives whom he had aboard that he was
not going to Rakahana, but to Fiji. The
Atlantic sailed direct to Puka Puka or
Danger Island, another of the Samoan
group. Before arriving at Puka Puka
Hayes asked Moete what he would say
to any natives who might come aboard.
On Moete saying he would say that they
had been stolen from Manihiki, Hayes or-
dered Moete and all the Manihikans to
go below when they got near the island,
and fastened down the hatches upon them,
and did this the whole time they lay off
Puka Puka, when any native boat ap-
proached the ship, fearing that if any
communication should take place he would
not be able to obtain any labourers from
Puka Puka. The attempt of Hayes to
obtain labour at Puka Puka did not at
first meet with much success, for the
natives from some cause seemed to have
been suspicious of his intentions. Through
the agency, however, of the native mis-
sionary, Okotai, the difficulties were to
a certain extent removed, and it was ar-
ranged that a small body of about, 19
should go, accompanied by their chief,
Pilote. The agreement was for six
months, to pick cotton at Voilete, in
Upola, but the chief was to remain with
them for two months, when he was to
be taken back to Puka Puka, and if satis-
fied with the treatment they received
Capt. Hayes was promised 100 labourers.
On Pilote of the Puka Pul ans coming on
board the Atlantic she was got under
weigh, but till she was well clear of Puka
Puka the Manihikans were not allowed on
deck. On seeing them and learning from
Moete how they had come on board, the
Puka Pukans concluded that they also
had been betrayed, and that Hayes did
not intend to carry out his engagements
With them —a suspicion, I fear, that was
well founded. Although the agreement
which purports to be signed by all the
natives, is to work for six months only
‘on the Island of Upola, or any other
island of the Samoa group/ to which both
Puka Puka and Manihiki belong, there, is
ver- strong evidence that the agreement
which Hayes induced the Puka Pukans
to sign, with or without the connivance
of the native missionary, was to labour
for five years at Naitamba, in the Fiji
Islands. Both Severight and Mr. Powell,
a missionary at Pago Pago, in the It land
of Tutuila,' to which the Atlantic pro-
ceeded direct, from Puka Puka, speak of
having seen such an agreement, and
Powell states that the agreement, which is
among, his papers, was forged lay Hayes
after his arrest by the natives, and while
Hayes was staying at Powell’s house. The
Atlantic arrived at Pago Pago on Decem-
ber 14. 1869, and next morning Hayes
ordered all the natives to go ashore to
wash their clothes, and ordered Moete
that he was not to let any of them escape.
Moete, however, informed Manga, the
chief of Pago Pago, that he and the other
Manihikans had been stolen from their
homes. Accordingly Manga took Moete
to Mr. Powell, the missionary, when Man-
ga said he intended to seize the Atlantic
and release the natives. Powell, how-
ever, warned Manga and Moete against
tne consequences of so violent a. proceed-
ing. After they left Powell, Severight
came to Powell and confirmed the state-
ment that the Atlantic was a man-stealer,
and that the natives had been kidnapped.
Powell thereon told the natives, Manga
and Moete, that they should tell the Mani-
hikans that if they had been stolen they
need not return to the ship, but they
had better stay ashore. Meantime, Moete
had returned, with the chief Manga, to
where he had left the Manihikans and
Puka Pukans, and found that they had
returned aboard the Atlantic. It was
then arranged_ that Moete should go back
to the Atlantic, assemble all the natives,
and advise them, on his giving a. signal,
they should all jump into the sea and
swim ashore. This was done, and, with
the exception of about 16 weakly ones,
they all jumped into the sea and reached
the shore safely. The few who remained
aboard were seized by Hayes and his crew,
and thrust below deck. At this time
the Atlantic’s boat, with the mate and
some of the crew, were on the shore tak-
ing in water, and Manga, finding that
some of the natives were still detained on
board, seized the boat and her crew. On
this Hayes armed himself with his re-
volvers, and, taking a native boat, pro-
ceeded ashore. Manga, seeing Hayes ap-
proach armed, and well knowing his des-
perate character, ordered some of his men
to put off in another canoe, with the di-
rections when they got into shallow wa-
ter to upset Hayes’s boat, and thus wet
his powder. This stratagem succeeded
perfectly, and Hayes, being* unable to use
his revolvers, was overpowered and dis-
armed. Notwithstanding Hayes’s previous
conduct the natives treated him with kind-
ness and consideration. They took him
to Mr. Powell’s house, and Manga at once
wrote to Mr. Hunkin (British Consular
Agent at Leone, the capital of Tutuila,
which was about 15 miles distant), stat-
ing what was done, and asking for Hun-
kin’s immediate attendance. Hunkin at
first declined, thinking the Atlantic was
an American vessel, but on receiving more
urgent letters from Manga and a letter
from Hayes saying that he was an Ame-
rican born, but the Atlantic was British,
Hunkin went to Pago Pago, where he ar-
rived on December 18, 1869, and found
Hayes still a - prisoner, but well treated.
After various negotiations it was agreed
that Hayes and the Atlantic should be
released, to enable her to proceed to Apia,
there to have the matter dealt with by
the British Consul; but as the natives
refused to trust themselves within Hayes’s
power it was arranged they should remain
at Pago Pago pending the reference to
10


the British Consul. It was thought every-
thing was arranged, but here the diffi-
culty arose on the part oi the crew of
the Atlantic, who likewise feared to re-
main on board with Hayes, believing that
once released he had no intention of going
to Apia. Hunkin therefore sent the
Atl-anite to Apia in charge of Hussey, the
mate, retaining Hayes with him; and, to
save _ appearances, Capt. Hayes requested
it might be given out that he remained as
Hunkin’s visitor. The natives also re-
mained at Pago Pago. The Atlantic ar-
rived at Apia on December 24. 1869, in
charge of Mr. Plussey, the mate, When Mr.
Williams (the British Consul) determined
to take her to Pago . Pago and bring Hayes
and the natives to Apia in her.
accordingly on January 9, 1870, Consul
Williams returned with them all to Apia,
and on January 12, 1870, opened a Court
of Enquiry, which continued till January
23, 1870, when, owing to Hayes having had
a fit which confined him to his bed, it was
suspended for some days. The enquiry
finished on February 24, 1870, and Consul
Williams concluded that Hayes was guilty,
and that the best course was to refer
the whole case to Sydney. Knowing the
desperate character of Hayes, and having
no place in which to confine him, and
being convinced that if he knew what
the decision was Hayes would escape, and
as no one could be found in Apia suffi-
ciently bold to take the Atlantic to Syd-
ney with Hayes aboard, the Consul wrote
Commodore Lambert, asking his assist-
ance. Hayes was suspicious that it was
intended to send him to Sydney, and,
being out on parole, thought it best to
make his escape, and on April 1, 1870, left
the island in the brig Pioneer, of Shang-
hai. _ After Hayes’s departure the At-
lantic was left in the Consul’s hands, the
owner, Mr. Betham, having refused to ac-
cept her on the Consul’s terms. The
Consul reports on March 7, 1870, that be-
tween January 7 and March 1 seven Puka
Pukans had died, more than one-third of
the whole, and others were very ill from
the change of diet, their food in their
home consisting entirely of fish and cocoa-
nuts. The papers do not show how many
survived, and what became of the sur-
vivors. Such axe the facts of this un-
happy case. I think there can be no
doubt that the charges against Hayes are
fully established. The natives appear to
me to give a clear and consistent account
of the whole transaction. Their evi-
dence is supported by that of Severight
and Powell, and in a measure by some of
Capt. Hayes’s witnesses. Indeed, Hayes
hardly appears to deny the charges. Hayes
does not deny that he agreed to take the
Manihikins and their cocoanuts to Roko-
hana, but sailed away with them to Puka
Puka. his excuse that the natives were
too few to land the cocoanuts, and that
they had brought only one boat, is a mere
pretext. It is admitted by Hayes’s wit-
nesses that the Manihikans came on board
under the impression they were going to
Rokdhana. The agreement which Hayes
produced is, so far as the Manihikans are
concerned, confessedly a forgery. The
statement of the mate and others of the
crew of the Atlantic that Moete brought
two young girls on board, saying they
ha.d_ been sent by the native missionary,
Tati, in whose house <Hayes had been
staying at Manihiki, for Capt. Hayes to
do what he liked with, if true would seri-
ously compromise the characters of Moete
and the missionary, but would not jus-
tify carrying off those people from their
homes. Remembering the unscrupulous
c aracter of Hayes, who is described by
Consul Williams as being a. man of despe-
rate character, “well known through the
colonies, San Francisco, Sandwich Island's,
and China,” whose career has “been one
of roguery,” so that “there are but few
parts of the world which he can go with-
out being apprehended by law, I think
that there can be little doubt that Ha.yes’s
intention was to take the natives against
their wills to the Fiji Islands and there
force them to labour. Had he succeeded
it may be doubted whether any of them
would ever again have returned to their
homes. It is Manga., the chief of Pago
Pago, to whose courage and determination
those poor natives entirely owe their li-
berty, that the greatest praise is due. The
skill with which he succeeded in disarming
Hayes, and thus preventing bloodshed,
and the consideration with which he sub-
sequently treated him while retaining him
as a prisoner, are deserving of the high-
est commendation. The service, too, was
one not unattended with danger, looking
at the desperate character of Hayes, and
seems to have been performed with great
judgment and discretion.”
Opinion of Crown Law officers on Mr.
Rothery’s report:—“We generally concur
with Mr. Rot'hery. Capt. Hayes may be
legally taken into custody on his arrival
in British territory, and sent for trial
before a British Court of law. The Con-
sul is justified in detaining the vessel
and sending for trial to Sydney.—R. P.
Collier, J. D. Coleridge, Travers Twiss.”

Bully Hayes, whose rascalities had made
blew Zealand and Australian ports too
hot for him, ran past Serna and anchored
in Sovi. The craft he had was a fine
brig, a New Zealand vessel (the Rona?).
When he left port he did not clear or ask
the owner for instructions. Shipping a
crew of his own stamp and two young
women as stewardesses, he found himself,
after a. good passage, at anchor in Sovi
Bay, Fiji. The natives brought 70 fine
pigs aboard. Hayes put them below, and
told the owners to gofor more. The owners
11


wanted payment for the first lot. Bully
demurred, loaded his carronades, and
hunted the OAvners of the pigs overboard.
In the ensuing toav he seized a fine girl
hv the hair of the head, and put her below
in the cabin, but the tAvo stewardesses
got jealous, and beat her, so Bully pitch-
ed their bedding overboard, tore up their
silk dresses and finery, and, as he said,
‘hammered them a trifle too.’ This caused
discontent ashore, and a canoe Avas sent
to the brig to tell the white man to keep
the pigs, but to return the woman. Bully
answered by firing a pistol at the men.
During the row the girl jumped overboard
and swam ashore, although she Avas hand-
cuffed. Bully was furious, and landed
with a feAV men and burned Sovi, the
blackened parts of Avhieh are yet standing.
Bully now shifted his anchorage, and
agreed Avith the wife of Mo, an Ame-
rican, to buy from the natives of Sigatoka
River all the oranges they could supply.
After Bully had got what he thought Avas
enough, he told Mo’s wife to come
aboard and get payment and divide it
among the natives. She and her children
Avere no sooner on deck than Bully hoist-
ed their poor little boat aboard, loosed
fiis sails, and canted the brig’s head to sen.
At this moment Mo and another whit©
man pulled alongside. Mo leaped on
deck, and •' upraided Bully for treating a
fellow-American in this scurvy manner.
Bully gave in, and Mo returned
ashore Avith his wife and chil-
dren. but without payment for the
oranges. Bully sailed for Yasawas sad
and hurt at the termination of the Siga-
toka affair. Here he kidnapped two young
girls, hut OAAfing to the hostility of the
natives, who failed to see the joke, he
up-anchored, crossed over to the mainland,
entering the reef at Raki Raid, and by
means of false pretences swindled the
Fijians out of a lot of beche-de-mer. The
natives earnestly appealed to Bully _ to
come ashore and shake hands before going.
“No, thank you,” said Bully; “I know a
trick worth tAvo of that. Let endeavour
to do good each in our own Avay, and
stifle revengeful feelings.” So, when on
his last tack, he gaA r e them a salute with
his Shotted carronades, as a reminder;
then hoisted the Stars and Stripes, and,
feeling he had done a good trade with
this tribe, be kicked the small cabin boy
seA 7 erely, and ordered him to bring him up
a stiff glass of rum and water. This Avas
Bully’s style of trading, hut he got from
bad to and became such a deter-
mined ruffian that he daxed not put into
any British port, and warships were on the
lookout for him. Ultimately he got kill-
ed by his mate in the eastern seas. _ He
had gone down into the cabin for a pistol
to shoot this man, Avho, having some
poAverful obiections to being made a tar-
get of. Quietly unshipped the tiller and
waited Hayes’s return. As the bully’s
head appeared above the companion Avay
the tiller descended upon it with crashing
force, and one scoundrel the less remained
upon earth to prey upon his fellow-men.”
There is probably a substratum _of _ truth
in the foregoing, but most of it is the
product of a journalist’s exuberance.
The Federal M.P. was born 1864. in
Devon, England, moved to Lon-
don, stowed away in the ship
Melbourne, and arrived in Melbourne
about 1874. Sailed from Melbourne to
China in the Meg Merilles. Was then in
the Ajax carrying coolies to Singapore.
He sayis:—“About March, 1877, I
bad been put ashore in Singapore from
the Ajax, being wrongfully suspected of
having smallpox. I bad nothing to du, and
was beachcombing in Singapore, getting a
meal now and then aboard various ships,
and being then about 13 years old. Hayes
arrived in Singapore with the cutter
Lotus, a smart vessel!, yacht-like in form,
of about 20 tons. Hayes took me on
the Lotus as boy. Those on board were
Hayes master, Peters the mate, a boy
(myself), tAvo natives, and a whits wo-
man, Jennie Ford. Hayes picked me up
out of kindness. Hayes was the essence
of kindness to me. I saw no sign of bru-
tality in him. I did not know then nor
till after he aaois killed that he was a
notorious man. I had not then heard of
him before. Of course, I was only a boy
of 13. From Singapore Ave sailed to
Manila, and about the Philippines and
Carolines, trading, &c. We did not carry
any regular cargo or frieght from port to
port. We called at Strong’s Island, but did
not see or hear anything of the Leonora
wreck. About August, 1877, we arrived
at Jaluit, in the Marshall Islands. The
Lotus anchored, and I Avas sent ashore
with one of the coloured crew in the only
boat the Lotus had, leaving Hayes, Peters,
and Mrs. Ford aboard. This was the day
Hayes Avas killed; but I did not see him
killed. The first I knew about it was
hearing Mrs. Ford screaming after we had
arrived a couple of hours. Then the Lotus
drifted on the reef at Jaluit, and was
wrecked, I never saAv Hayes or his body
after leaving the Lotus in the boat to go
ashore, nor Peters either. I think Peters
sot away. Mrs- Ford was brought ashore
from the wreck. Probably Hayes’s body
drifted from the wreck of the Lotus out
to sea. It is probable that after Hayes
Avas killed Peters tried to get away Avith
the Lotus, and got her under way, and the
Lotus then drifted on to the reef. The
story AA r as that Peters killed Hayes with
the tiller. The Lotus Avas steered with a
tiller, but it Avas too heavy to be un-
shipped and used to kill Hayes. More
probably an iron belaying pin was used.
I do not knoAV Avhat became of Mrs.
Ford after she was got ashore from the
AVreck. She Avas sent a way somewhere. I
came from Jaluit to Samoa in the Black
Hawk, and stayed among the islands for
years in various vessels. I became an able
seaman at 17, and knew and srav often
Louis Becke, who Avas sailing out of Sa-
moa.
