UNITED SERVICE INSTITUTION,
NEW SOUTH WALES.
INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
Gentlemen :
We are assembled here this evening to take what I estimate to
be a very important step in the history of the Defence Forces of New South
Wales, viz., the inauguration of a United Service Institution, having for its
main object the higher professional education of officers, and, as a corollary,
the maintenance of those Forces in such a state of efficiency and preparation
as will, on emergency, bear the strain of war. It remains to be seen if we
shall rise to the occasion, but if such is to be the case we must all put our
shoulders to the wheel, and demonstrate that we, at all events, are not
unmindful or careless of the sacred trust confided to us by New South
Wales as her defenders ; that we do not wear her uniform for purposes of
mere display, but that we rather attach a deeper and more patriotic value to
the commissions we have the honor to hold. Much individual sacrifice has
been made in the past, much undeserved ridicule and discouragement has
been thrown in our way, but it is to be hoped that the public are gradually
becoming more alive and interested in the vital question of defence. The
Parliament has hitherto voted the necessary funds, and Governments now
regard the military question, with its large contingent expenditure, as worthy
of more than passing consideration, which it is to be hoped will, in duo time,
ripen into the adoption of a fixed military policy. I moreover assert that it
is only by such a policy can thorough efficiency, economy, and content be
secured, and the Forces themselves placed in a position to command the
confidence and sympathy of the public.
It has been sought to found this institution on lines approximating to
those of the Royal United Service Institution of the Old Country, by which
military and naval art, science, and literature will be promoted. To this end
will be required a reading-room and library, containing historical, scientific,
and professional works a topographical room, with maps, charts, and plans ;
a museum, for objects illustrative of the progress of military and naval art
among nations; together with the reading of papers on professional subjects,
with discussions thereon, at its stated meetings, and the playing of the war
game, &c. Rules and Bylaws have been passed, and a council of eighteen has
been elected for the management of the institution. His Excellency the
Governor and Commander-in-Chief has consented to become patron, and
His Excellency the Admiral Commanding the Australian Squadron, the
Lieutenant-Governor, and the Hon. the Colonial Secretary are vice-patrons.
Most of you are aware that efforts have been previously made to establish
a lecture and reading-room on somewhat similar, but less pretentious lines


bat I think I should be somewhat wanting in honesty were I not on this occa-
sion to indicate Lieutenant-Colonel Eowe, commanding Engineers, as the person
who directly resurrected the infant of this evening, and which, we all hope, will
live to develop a useful career; but like most productions, it is at the outset
dependant on the fostering care of maternity in some shape or other,
hence our application to the Government for aid. Ihe application preferred
by the Council was for �2OO to start the institution, and thereafter an annual
grant of pound for pound subscribed, a sum certainly not a whit too large
upon which to commence operations with effect, as the provision of a suitable
library and professional papers and periodicals will alone absorb a large
amount. Judging by the public utterances of the Premier, Sir Henry Parkes,
and the important steps which he has recently taken to place the defence on an
effective basis, Ido not anticipate we shall be disappointed. I cannot think
he will hold his hand, and condemn to the cold shade of neglect an institution
which, if honestly and well conducted, is designed to exercise so pronounced
a bearing on the defence of our country.
I shall now endeavour to show how much a Military Institute is considered
an actual necessity, not only by ourselves, but by others well qualified to
?judge. Eor this purpose I shall offer brief quotations from the Reports of
the Eoyal Commission of 1881 (of which the late Sir James Martin was
President), and of Major-General Schaw, C.B. The Commission, referring
to officers of the Permanent Artillery, says ? The Committee are unani-
mous in recommending that a school for instruction, with the necessary
instructors, be formed, in order that officers may attain a definite standard
of military knowledge. Instruction to be conducted by qualified officers,
and to include such subjects as reconnaissance, field sketching, surveying,
field fortification, minor tactics, elementary chemistry, and mathematics.
With respect to the officers of other branches of the Local Forces, the Com-
mittee recommend (in addition to the curriculum then in force) they should
have some knowledge of field fortification, reconnaissance, and minor tactics.
Whilst the Committee, with a view to economy, recommend for the present
one school of instruction, they consider that all officers of the Local Forces
should be required to go through a course suitable to the branch in which
they are serving, embracing such subjects as minor tactics, field fortification,
surveying and reconnaissance. The Committee strongly that a
military library and a reading and lecture room should be established in some
convenient position in Sydney, subject to the control of the Commandant,
and that an annual grant should be made for the purchase of books, and the
expenses of a reading-room. In the opinion of the pomraittee much good
would result if lectures and discussions on military subjects were encouraged.?
The Committee concludes ?It would be desirable to establish a central
military school, on a plan somewhat similar to that in Canada, for the
instruction of the Australian Local Forces.?
Major-General Schaw, in his admirable and most able report, thus
delivers himself? It is most desirable that fhe federation of the Australian
Colonies for land defence, as well as naval defence, should be accomplished,
and that an Australian Military School, for officers of all arms, should be


established, as in Canada; and, when properly trained colonial officers are
available, they should be appointed in due course to the higher ranks. In
the meantime I would suggest the formation of a military branch of the
Sydney University, with a military professor to teach artillery, fortification,
tactics, and military administration and law. The existing faculties would
give the necessary instruction in mathematics and physics. A stringent
system of examinations of all candidates for commissions before appointment,
as well as successive examinations for promotion, should be insisted on for
all officers, whether for the Permanent or Volunteer Forces, the standard and
subjects being varied according as the commissions were to be given in the
artillery, engineers, infantry, or cavalry. The existing regulations provide
in some measure for such examinations, but the lists of subjects need
revision, and a military school where candidates can study is much
wanted. A military library, and a room for military lectures, and for
playing the war game, and as a general meeting place for the officers, an
acknowledged want, might possibly bo provided at the University.?
By the above quotations, it will be clearly seen that our action in the
present instance is quite in accord with the recommendations of the Com-
mission and of General Schaw, and it is not too much to expect that the
Government, on this ground alone, will afford the necessary support and
encouragement. It may be asked what has been done since 1881 towards
carrying out these valuable suggestions of the Commission. I can only
reply, next to nothing. It is true, however, that a so-called school of
gunnery under Colonel Bingham, E.A., has been established. I say so-called,
not by way of reflection, but because building, appliances, and conveniences
are incomplete and insufficient. The,money required for the erection of a
suitable building has been voted more than once, but the work cannot be pro |
ceeded with until it is decided whether the head-quarters of the artillery shall
remain at the Victoria Barracks, or be transferred to Middle Head, as
recommended by General Schaw. Excellent work has been carried on at
this school, notwithstanding the disabilities I have referred to. It may be
mentioned that to Colonel Roberts is duo the credit of this educational
advance; for it was during my absence on active service in Egypt that ho
induced the Government of the day to secure the services of four Imperial
officers as instructors, viz., Colonel Bingham, Major Bunbury, and Captain
Millward, of the Royal Artillery, and Lieutenant Colonel Penrose, of the
Royal Engineers. Although the services of these gentlemen have been
utilized principally in connection with what is known in the service as the
scientific corps, and cannot be said to embrace the extensive curriculum of
study recommended bj T either the Commission or General Schaw, yet both
Colonels Bingham and Penrose may be assured they have made their
mark in the Colony. Those conversant with their labours, and especially
those who have had the benefit of their instruction, will recognize their
high qualifications as English gentlemen and officers, and the happy and
judicious application of those qualities in their daily association with the
Forces. Now that the time draws near for them to be succeeded by others, I
feel sure that it must be a source of great gratification to them to feel that


they have performed their duties so satisfactorily, and that they will con-
sequently carry with them the respect, esteem, and good wishes of all ranks
in the service. With the exception, then, of this school of instruction, and
extending the syllabus of examination, nothing has been done to give effect
to the recommendations of the Commission and General Schaw in this direc-
tion. I may, however, say that within the last few days the matter of
establishing a military chair at the University has been under the considera-
tion both of the Government and the Senate of that institution. I look
upon the feasibility of establishing a central Australian College on Canadian
lines as a project but looming in the dim future, and contingent upon the
federation of the Australian Colonies. Those who are familiar with the
divergent conditions of political and social life of these Colonies will be
disposed to think it is hardly worth while to delay the proper training and
instruction of officers in anticipation of a federated Australia.
As the particular matter under consideration bears solely upon the Local
Forces, I am led to the belief that a brief history of them from their initiation
to the present time will not only be appropriate but welcome as a record
for the Institution. The first Volunteer Military Force was enrolled in
Sydney in 1854, under an Act of Council, 18th Victoria No. 8, and
consisted of one battery of Artillery, one troop of Cavalry, and six companies
of rifles, numbering on the 30th June, the following year, 310 of all ranks.
It was under the command of Colonel Bloomfield, of H.M. 11th Eegiment,
and practically ceased to exist in 1850. In 1800 a second Volunteer Force
was enrolled under the Act above quoted, supplemented by Eegulations and
Corps Eules, and consisted, in the first instance, of two batteries of artillery
in Sydney and one in Newcastle, one troop of mounted rifles, and fourteen
companies of rifles in Sydney and suburbs, and six companies of rifles in
the country districts, numbering on the Ist of January, 1801, 1,690 of all
ranks. This force was under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Kempt, of
H.M. 12th Eegiment. In 1802, Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, of that
regiment, took command as senior officer in the Colony, to be succeeded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Kempt in 1803, on the occasion of the head-quarters of
the regiment proceeding to New Zealand. The present Officer Commanding
the Forces was appointed to the command in February, 1805. To the end
of 1807 the strength of the Force varied to some extent. The mounted
rifles had ceased to exist in 1862, and four additional batteries of artillery
were raised in Sydney in 1807, and the companies of Eifles at head-quarters
Avere organized as two regiments. No standard of efficiency appears to ha\ r e
existed up to this point. Here ended, in 1807, the purely volunteer system,
or that in which State aid was confined to the provision of instruction, arms,
clothing, equipment, rifle ranges, ammunition, &c. The average annual
strength for this period appears to have been 1,787 of all ranks. At this
juncture the Force ivas in danger of extinction, but was resuscitated by the
introduction of an Act of Parliament, entitled ? The Volunteer Eegulations
Act of 1807,? and regulations thereunder, which held out inducement in the
shape of grants of land to be issued as payment to such Volunteers as might
serve continuously and efficiently for five years. The standard of efficiency


then consisted of an annual attendance at sixteen drills and shot practice
by the artillery, and fourteen drills with musketry every second year by
Infantry, which exercises, it may be remarked, were generally performed at
night. Calculating the land order to cost the country �(3O (Government
upset price of land with departmental expenses for surveying, &c.), it may
bo computed that each Volunteer was paid for becoming efficient at the rate
of �l2 a year. The Imperial troops were withdrawn from New South
Wales in 1870, and in the following year colonial regulars were raised,
consisting of one battery of garrison artillery and two companies of infantry.
The latter were disbanded in 1872. In 1876 the Artillery was increased by
a second, and in 1877 by a third battery. * The Volunteer Force, resuscitated
by the land order system, attained its maximum establishment and strength
in 1874, and consisted in Sydney of ten batteries of Artillery, one corps
of Engineers, and two rifle regiments of seven and eight companies
respectively. In the Western, Northern, and Southern districts were one
battery of artillery and thre rifle regiments of eight, four, and five
companies respectively. For various reasons it was determined, in 1874, that
no liability should be incurred in regard to payment by grants of land
beyond that already undertaken, and to be anticipated in the prospective
issue to volunteers then in the Force, and maturing service towards such
orders. Accordingly, by the stoppage of recruiting, any further liability in
this respect was avoided. After the cessation of payment by the land order
system the Volunteer Force for the third time commenced to wane, and
considerable difficulty was experienced in getting together sufficient numbers
for drill. This, in conjunction with the frequent references to Parliament
by members of the Force, and the publication of a mass of correspondence,
disclosed the existence of a litigious and insubordinate spirit, incompatible
with the usefulness of the Force as a military body. Added to this Parliament
over and over again demanded its reorganization on a basis which would
secure increased discipline and efficiency. This was effected towards the
close of 1878 on the principles obtaining at the present time, which may be
shortly summarized as payment for actual work done. Under this system
a private of infantry say, can earn �l2 by annually attending nine days
continuous training in camp, and three whole days and thirteen half-days at
detached periods and qualifying in musketry as a second class shot. Compare
this with the ridiculously small and insufficient training required for pay and
efficiency under the old system, and we shall realize what an enormous
increase of work is now exacted from the individual for the same money, and
what gain to the service must result therefrom in discipline and efficiency.
Altogether I do not think the public have any reason to complain that their
interests have been neglected in this direction. The next noteworthy
incident is the despatch on 3rd March, 1885 of a field battery of artillery, a
battalion of infantry and a small ambulance corps numbering in all 770
officers and non-commissioned officers and men, and 218 horses to take part
in the Suakim campaign under Lieut.-General Sir Gerald Graham, G.C.M.G.,
K.C.8., V.C. The incidents of that expedition have been already so ex-
haustively discussed and are so fresh in your minds that I will spare you


further enlargement of the topic beyond reverting to the fact that the
military representatives of N. S. Wales enjoyed on that occasion the rare
distinction of being brigaded with the Imperial Guards under Major-General
Lyon-Eremantle, C.B. It was during this time that a scare set in with regard
to the intentions of Eussia towards the Indian Empire by way qf Afghanis-
tan, and N. S. Wales not to be behind her neighbours feverishly set to work
at the eleventh hour to place her military house in order, by raising existing
corps to a war strength; by taking special precautions of a sub-marine mining
character; and by ordering from England guns and warlike materiel. In
addition no less than sixty-three reserve or purely volunteer corps were
enrolled of which ten were cavalry, four artillery, and forty-nine infantry.
Truly we have reason to thank the Czar for indirectly placing at our ultimate
disposal additional men, money, and materiel not only on this but on former
occasions I could name. But what a mistaken military policy is this, which
thus waits until the wolf is supposed to be at the door to initiate measures
which in the very nature of things could not be made available for the imme-
diate occasion. During the last year the Government has been acting upon the
recommendation of General Schaw by organizing a permanent corps of sub-
marine miners, and permanent and partially paid corps of mounted infantry,
A Medical Staff Corps has also been formed. Eeserve rifle companies have
been substituted for those reserve corps which have been unable to maintain
the required standard of efficiency.
I am indebted to Captain Hixson, E.N., Commanding Naval Forces, for
the following details in connection with the same :
The Naval Brigade was raised in 18G3, under the Volunteer Act already
quoted, and consisted of five companies at Sydney and one at Newcastle,
composed for the most part of discharged seaman from H.M. Navy and those
who had served their time in the Mercantile Marino. The corps numbered
320 of all ranks, served under the partial-payment system, and was com-
manded by the above-named officer. It was the original intention
that this Corps should have manned H.M.S. ? Brunswick,? a 74-gun-
ship, which the Imperial Government was willing to hand over to
the Colony for defensive purposes. It was, however, subsequently ascer-
tained that the cost of putting this vessel in an effective condition
would be about �OO,OOO, and the project was abandoned. There being
then no vessels available, the Brigade, with the exception of boat exercises,
had to carry on its training and exercise on shore. The Volunteer Naval
Artillery was organized in 1883, under Commander Lee, and numbered 140
of all ranks, and was stationed in Sydney. This corps, which is on a purely
volunteer basis, was composed of a smart body of young men, who showed
considerable aptitude and zeal in learning their duties. They acquired a
fair knowledge of naval gunnery, boat exercise, and general work; and
advantage has frequently been taken of the ? Wolvereue ? for cruising and
instructional purposes. The war scare of 1885 also affected these Forces,
for the Naval Brigade was doubled, viz., to 010, at which it remained for
about two years, when it resumed its normal strength.

This practically brings us down to to-day, and I should wish to show how
we stand as regards the personnel of the Forces. The Military and Naval
Establishments are as follows :
It is estimated that a war strength of 10,000 could be developed, and
would include 300 of that splendid body, the Mounted Police, which
Inspector-General Fosbery has intimated as being available on an emer-
gency. I may also mention that a general scheme of defence has been
formulated, which could be put into operation and the Forces mobilized
without delay.
I now propose to offer for your consideration a few words as to the
present condition of these Forces. , The Eeserve Cavalry is fairly trained ;
the men arc excellent riders and well mounted, and I see no reason why
they should not constitute a corps admirably suited for an Irregular Service.
Whether or no the Government will largely extend this branch, as has been
more than once intimated, is I think open to question. It would no doubt
be of advantage to have one or even two thousand ? Bush Cavalry,? but there
is the question of expense to meet, that ogre which dogs the footsteps of
military progress. Tnthe Permanent Artillery we possess a fine an dwell-trained
corps, wliich, combined with the partially-paid and Eeserve Artillery, con-
stitute a body of effective gunners. A Field Battery permanently horsed in
connection with the first named is in course of formation, and will
strengthen the Field Force in a material degree. The Engineers have always
enjoyed and deserved the reputation of being a very efficient corps. The
Submarine Mining Branch has recently undergone a decided change, for in
addition to the parti ally-paid element, a small permanent corps has been
enrolled, and the whole submarine mining defence has been placed under the
command of Lt.-Col. Penrose, E.E. In effecting this change the Govern-
ment recognized the absolute necessity of this most important and scientific
branch, as with Artillery, being under the direct control of an Officer of
Eegulars, and that a permanent nucleus should be formed of men continu-
ously trained and accustomed to the multifarious and complex conditions which
surround the submarine defence. The requirements of this service would


not be met by any perfunctory performance of duty, or by persons whose
civil avocations monopolised their time and attention. Everybody recognizes
in the head of the Telegraph Department an electrician of the foremost
rank, and did the efficiency of the submarine service depend on that condi-
tion alone, no better man would have been found for the control of the
same. In my opinion it redounds much to the credit of Lt.-Col. Cracknell
that he had the patriotism and good sense to recognize these service
exigencies which led to the corps being placed upon the present rooting.
The Permanent and Partially-paid Mounted Infantry now in course of
organization should furnish an invaluable body, composed of fearless and
good riders, mounted on horses which can do any amount of work, and
acting over a country extremely favourable to mounted infantry. In the
event of an enemy landing, say at Botany, with the intention of advanc-
ing on the city, it is not too much to suppose that small bodies of these
wasps would harass him with attacks night and day, hang upon his flanks,
and threaten and cut his communications; in point of fact he should have
neither rest nor peace from the time he set foot on shore until he left it ?if
he ever did. The weak point of mounted infantry is undoubtedly its
liability to be caught red-handed by cavalry, but luckily for us the cavalry
of an enemy will have no place in an attack upon the Colony. The four
infantry regiments are composed of excellent material, well-trained and
disciplined, and as a general rule much credit is due to all ranks for the
manner in which they have applied themselves to their work. The new
Medical Staff Corps is being trained under Surgeon.Major Williams of the
General Staff, who has been appointed its instructor. It may not be generally
known that this officer, a short time ago, visited England, and whilst there
underwent a course of instruction at Aldershot in stretcher and bearer drill
and Staff Corps duties generally. He secured a first-class certificate of pro-
ficiency out of seven given, and, as a matter of fact, came out at the top of
a list of seventy-seven who then went through the course. The Infantry
Eeserves have not, as a rule, proved satisfactory, and have again demon-
strated that the purely volunteer movement is after a time apt to languish.
Indeed a similar state of affairs exists in the other Colonies, which, for the
most part, have followed the example of New' South Wales in substituting
for it what we have termed the partially-paid force. The cause of the
decadence of these corps, I cannot help thinking, is in a great measure to be
accounted for by the character of the young native-born men, who w'eary
of monotony and desire change. This is seen, especially in the country, even
in regard to sports ; any amount of energy being expended for a time on
one description of sport, to be succeeded by depression, and finally adherence
to another game, and so the changes are rung. It is intended to absorb, as
far as possible, into the partially-paid force those Reserve Corps which have
showm the most vitality and are best situated for the purposes of mobiliza-
tion and training. Other corps have found refuge with the new Reserve
Rifle Companies which are being formed throughout the Colony for
the purpose of fostering the military spirit, developing the use of the
rifle amongst the population and furnishing a reserve force handy for


absorption in time of war. A very important change has also been
made by the transfer of the Ordnance Store and Barrack Department,
under Major Blanchard, to military control; and I feel assured that by this
step greater economy and check will result, much inconvenience and friction
will be avoided, and the Requirements of the service will in every way bo
more satisfactorily met. In naval matters a considerable improvement has
been effected, by the amalgamation of the Naval Brigade and Naval Artillery
Volunteers under one head, and by vesting the Naval Branch with the
offensive torpedo service, for which purpose the steam launches ? A vermis ?
and ? Acheron,? Swartzkoff torpedoes, and appliances generally have been
handed over to Captain Hixson ; as also by placing the ? Wolverene ? at his
disposal for training and instructional purposes. So far so good ; but the
real question lays behind, viz., the annual training which shall in the future
be .given to fit officers and men for the important part they might be called
upon to play in the defence of the ports. No secret is made by Captain
Hixson and his officers that the training hitherto bestowed upon the Force
has been rather appertaining to land than sea ; but whose fault is this ?
assuredly not theirs, for men cannot go to sea without ships. It is rather
premature to discuss this question, but I am given to understand that in
Victoria the training and instruction is very complete and comprehensive.
lam sure that it may be safely left to the Commander of this Force to see
that we shall not be behind our neighbours in any respect, and that our
Naval Forces shall be fully equal to the requirements of the service.
Having thus touched upon the institution, its object and hopes, the
recommendations which from time to time have been made for the higher
education of officers, and the state of the Defence Forces, I think I should
offer a few remarks on the condition of European and Colonial warfare,
with the idea of measuring local requirements. It is not to bo supposed
that I can do more on this occasion than touch the subject in the most
superficial manner. It is of such magnitude that it could only be met
by studious and diligent preparation of a paper, or rather, I should say,
series of papers, unattainable to officers who, like myself, are charged
with an all-absorbing amount of administrative and other work. I ap-
proach with the utmost diffidence the Naval question. For many years a
battle has raged between the Navy and the Artillery, or, in other words,
ships and guns, which latter, I opine, have at all events gained a temporary
advantage. To an outsider it must seem that, in the long run, this advan-
tage will become permanent, seeing there must be some finality to the
floating capabilities of ships, whilst the power of guns promises to be further
magnified by newly-discovered agents of terrific explosive force, and, if we
are to believe all we hear, against which nothing can stand. The public
mind does not seem to be altogether in accord as to the precise construction
and capabilities of the various ships required for Imperial purposes, but as
far as we are concerned, fast cruisers, armed with powerful guns, are of the
type required for the colonies. I can imagine no better or more effective
device for the protection of our coasts and commerce, than is to be found
in the Naval Defence Act about to be put in operation, and which


places that duty in the hands of a British Admiral and British sailors.
It is folly to suppose that our interests can be best guarded by keeping the
Australian Squadron in contiguity to the various ports. On the contrary, there
exist on the high seas various strategic points, and it is at these the ships
must he. I gather from the English papers, that the recent naval
manoeuvres brought to light certain deficiencies and weaknesses, and the
decision of the Admiralty to materially increase the strength of the navy,
would seem to justify the uneasy feeling that it is not at present in sufficient
power to be abreast of the times. There is, however, one phase of the situa-
tion which may give comfort and confidence, and that is, even if both ships
and guns are defective, we have good reason to believe that our sailors are as
staunch and true as ever, and will go far to pull up any leeway in the former
respect. In one case the evil can be remedied, but any decadence in the
national characteristics of our sailors would be fatal to the proud position and
prestige pre-eminently enjoyed for hundreds of years by the navy of Old
England. The Imperial army stands unique as compared with the enor-
mous armies of the Great Powers, in that it is composed of volunteers, as
against pressed men. This has been a boast in the past, and, I believe, the
majority of Englishmen of the present day still pride themselves in the
belief that it is unnecessary to resort to conscription to give England an
army in keeping with her traditional greatness and a foreign policy which
constituted her a Titan among nations. This may be so, but I incline'to
the opposite view, and the iron fact must not be forgotten that, however
good the material of an army may be, Providence, ceteris paribus, is on the
side of the big battalions. Compulsory service has undoubtedly its evils,
but on the other hand much good results by training and disciplining
the early manhood of a country, besides giving an enormous access
of protective power. Surely such a system bore fruit in the orderly
and admirable conduct of the Germans when on Erench soil, by which
the war was robbed of half its horrors. It was at first predicted that
the introduction of the breech-loader would limit the role of cavalry
to comparatively minute proportions. This opinion has not been justi-
fied by results, for although cavalry can no longer charge . organized
infantry, yet it is more than ever the eyes and ears of an army,
and when properly handled affords it that comfort, rest and security
which no other branch can. The functions of engineers remain
much the same, viz., to open roads, and to construct works of
a permanent and temporary character. Whilst this may be generally
said to be the case, yet it has been left to engineers to develop a
system of warfare of a most scientific and formidable character, viz., sub-
marine mining. Heretofore navies may be said to have pretty well held
their own against the torpedo, but when wo read of a boat which is able to
travel rapidly and unseen under water, and to discharge torpedoes in that
position, it seems difficult to realize how vessels are to frequent waters
patrolled by such formidable engines of destruction. Another speciality
of engineers is ballooning, and it may not be too much to predict that in
addition to its uses for observation it may at some future day be utilized in


connection with hand explosives. Artillery, as in the past, paves the way for
the attack of infantry, protects it, and confirms its success, and the functions
of this arm are but little changed. The power of artillery has been much
enhanced by improvements in heavy ordnance, field-pieces, accuracy of fire
through bqtter system of range-finding, the introduction of machine and
quick firing guns, and high angle fire from rifled howitzers. As regards
infantry, I think we may accept as a truism what that pleasant and com-
panionable little work, the Field Exercise, says on the subject, viz,:?? As a
general principle, whatever the proportions of the different arms may be,
the role of infantry is the most important, and on it will fall the brunt of
warfare whether on the march or on the battle-field.? It seems to me that
infantry is in no way behind other branches of the service in the race for
distinction. Not so long since it was the breech-loader that settled the
question of frontal attacks in the negative, and the best method of attack
formation, and rapidly passing over the dangerous zone has not even yet
been practically solved. The sound system of attack tentatively
introduced by that fine soldier, Sir Archibald Alison, G.C.8., in the Aldershot
command, may possibly set the question at rest. We however are on
the eve of still greater developments consequent on the introduction of
the magazine rifle, combined with the use of a smokeless and nearly noise-
less powder, and it requires no great stretch of imagination to realize
that the tactics of the present will be open to change. Hitherto the
noise and smoke of battle carried so much information with them, and it
may happen that operations may be conducted by forces almost in touch
with each other and yet one portion be ignorant of an attack on the
other and thus open the door to be beaten in detail. Combined opera-
tions will be rendered more difficult, especially where extreme nicety
of time has to be studied, and unseen and silent attacks by small
bodies of Infantry will be especially embarrassing. Everything points
to the fact that if we are to keep pace with the times, discipline is more
than ever necessary, and less reliance is to be placed on insufficiently
trained levies. I may now touch upon a new branch of the Service, viz.,
mounted infantry, which as you are aware has been tried in Africa and
Egypt with good results, notwithstanding scratch teams, so to speak, were
made use of?for they were organized for the occasion, and picked up their
knowledge as they went. The experience thus gained has led to the forma-
tion of a school of instruction at Aldershot, and, as far as can be judged, the
mounted infantryman will, for the future, have his recognized place in the
battle-field, at all events as far as England is concerned in her small wars.
Many years ago Colonel Chesney, of the Royal Engineers, strongly advo-
cated that 30,000 of these should form an integral portion of the Imperial
army. As you all know the Americans in the war of Secession made great
use of what after all was only mounted infantry. I now come to that
important branch, viz., the Commissariat and Transport, without which all
strategy, tactics, fighting .power, &c., are paralyzed and rendered of none
effect. Whether an army relies on its base, or on the country it tra-
verses, it is to this service it looks for the supply and distribution of the


munitions of war and de louche. The question of supply and issue has
always been a knotty problem, it too often represents shackles on the legs of
an army, and to me it is marvellous that some portion at least of this
momentuous question does not enter into the professional education of
all officers. The duties and responsibilities of the head of this depart-
ment in the field are numerous, and involving the possession of special
tact, foresight, and knowledge; in fact he should be what is commonly
known as a ? strong man.? I will not say more on this head, seeing that Sir
Edward Strickland, K.C.B, is one of our number, and I do hope that he, as a
past-master in the art, will see fit on some future date to give us the benefit
of his great knowledge and experience. The medical service has won for
itself a high position with its complete and elastic organization for the field.
At one time anything was thought good enough for this department; but
the soldier of to-day may go into action with the assurance that if wmunded
he will receive not only reasonably prompt attention and the best medical
skill, but that his sojourn in hospital will be attended by comfort, and,
indeed, comparative ?luxury. This is indeed a great advance on matters of
some years ago, when the soldier not infrequently suffered prolonged agony
on the battle-field, and was moreover subject to attack by predatory ruffians
of the worst description. The second line of defence consists of the old
constitutional force, the militia, concerning which the general opinion is
favourable. This force has done good service in the past, and more latterly
in foreign garrison, and in furnishing its quota to the regular army. I had
the opportunity of seeing some regiments at Aldershot in 1882, and had
every reason to think well of them. Of the volunteers I necessarily know
but little ; but from all accounts it is a fine force, and equal to the position
assigned to it by the mobilization scheme promulgated a few years since.
Persons in this Colony have often advocated the organization of the local
volunteers on similar principles, forgetting that the nature of the service of
the two forces is very dissimilar. In England the volunteers have the
regular army and the militia consorted with them; here the so-called volun-
teers would have for the most part no such aids. They must perforce occupy
the first line, hence their training is of a far more exacting and militia
character than that of their English confreres.
The conditions of colonial warfare are very different to those waged by
European powers, inasmuch that the former will be on purely defensive
lines. It cannot be doubted that for a considerable number of years the
policy of the colonies must be like that of America, one of non-interven-
tion, and we are not likely to make war on our neighbours ; and it follows,
therefore, that we, to a great extent, are freed from conditions which require
the most perfect organization, &c. Here we have no strategic considerations
to consult, the difficulties of supply and transport are reduced to a minimum,
and the elaborate appliances of war and perfect detail required for opera-
tions in an enemy?s country are not in so high a degree necessary. If we
fight, it will bo on our own ground, and the theatre of operations must be
extremely circumscribed. At the same time let it not be supposed but that
we have plenty to do and to learn to keep ourselves level with the situation.


The professional education of officers must especially he made the subject of
care and insistance. The effective service of guns, in conjunction with sub-
marine mines, the skilful handling of vessels, and the art of handling troops
in the field, are absolutely essential to success. When men see that their
officers are thoroughly conversant with their duties, there follows that discip-
line, mutual reliance, cohesion and flexibility of manoeuvre, which distinguishes
an army from an armed mob. We have, it is true, taken great strides in
regard to the training of our troops ; but yet, more remains to be done, and
above all we must avoid falling into that fatal error of trying to run before
we can walk. A great blot on our military system, and one which militates
much against the efficiency of the regular branch of the force is, that no
provision exists for the retirement of officers who, through age, infirmity, or
otherwise, become incapacitated ; hence promotion is blocked, disgust is
engendered by a position of hopeless stagnation, which to say the least of
it, is wonderfully conducive to the perfunctory and listless performance of
duty. The Regular Service must be made more of a profession if ws are
to possess the prime elements of efficiency and esprit de corps. Why
these officers should be singled out for this disability, whilst those of
the Civil Service are exempt, is to me a riddle, unless it may be that
the public view the military forces with apathy, and are unable to ap-
preciate their raison d'etre at its true value. There is also another
point which has an important bearing upon the military question, and
that is its civil administration. The department has admittedly increased to
proportions which demand for it special consideration, and that delay should
not occur in dealing with necessary measures, seeing the issues involved are
sometimes great, and possibly momentous. Whether the existing system
can be better improved by the institution of a separate department of defence,
or by the appointment of a permanent military secretary, is a question for the
higher authorities to decide. Personally lam of opinion that the latter would
meet our wants for the present, inasmuch as the official referred to, being
untrammelled with the large responsibilities and duties attaching to any other
department of the Public Service, would be free to study the wants of the
military and naval forces, and to hold in his hand the various threads of the
defence question, and be generally au fait with the actual condition of affairs.
A permanent secretary should in my opinion be a military officer of experience,
possessed of administrative knowledge and cognizant with the written and un-
written codes, in other words, the laws and customs of the service, and it is
also of importance that he should be in touch with the pulse of the people.
In dealing with questions of defence, the Minister has to study political and
monetary issues, as well as those of a military character, to which it is patent
he can give but limited consideration seeing that he is also saddled with the
cares and responsibilities of government, the control of a vast civil depart-
ment, and his parliamentary duties. Under such circumstances it cannot, I
imagine, be gainsaid that a permanent military secretary of the type indicated
would, by performing his duties from the Ministerial standpoint, and without
subordinating or neglecting' military necessities, go far to relieve his chief of
much labour, anxiety, and fear of compromise. In any case I feel sui?e I


echo the sentiments of every officer present when I say that the military and
naval services would benefit vastly by the adoption of either alternative.
The question whether New South Wales shall or shall not possess a reliable
defence organization rests entirely in the hands of the Government of the
day. The personnel is to hand, and a high military spirit pervades the people,
as has been shown on more than one occasion. An experience of over
thirty-four years in the Imperial and Colonial Services enables me to assert
that the Australian is capable of being converted into a capital soldier. He
has, however, one peculiarity, which is that when first caught he must be
judiciously bitted and gradually accustomed to the bonds of discipline; he is
easy to lead but difficult to drive.
In concluding my remarks I am sure it is in accord with your wishes
that I should on this occasion acknowledge the debt of gratitude we owe to
His Excellency Lord Carrington, our Governor and Commander-in-Chief, for
the warm interest he has evinced, and the active assistance he has on all
occasions given in anything tending to the improvement and welfare of the
forces ; also, that we ow r e much to Sir Henry Parkes and the Government
for the important steps taken to carry out Major-General Schaw?s recom-
mendations, and we can only hope Sir Henry will complete the good work
he has begun with so much benefit to the country and the service ; and lastly,
that he will see fit to afford this institution the recognition and support
to which it is undoubtedly entitled on strict public grounds.
