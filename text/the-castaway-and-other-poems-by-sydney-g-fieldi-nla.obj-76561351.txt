The following poem was suggested l)y an incident that came
under the author?s notice some years ago, while a youth,
at sea.
Two young people attached to each other, and living in the
colonies, were compelled by circumstances to part.
The young man went to sea.
After many years, they accidentally met again on a ship
outward bound from England. The rest of the story is told
in the poem itself.

THE CASTAWAY
PART I.
A thousand miles from land away,
A , gallant ship on the ocean lay ;
The sky is bright, the breezes light
That though her shrouds and cordage play.
Around her deck a crew as brave
As ever roamed o?er the heaving wave
Are clustered ; ?tis the dog-watch hour?
That hour when jolly sailors long,
When toil is done, to sing the song,
Or to softly speak of home
And loving hearts far o?er the foam ;
Perhaps with trembling voice to tell
Of dangers past, or nymphs that dwell
Beneath the sea, and sometimes sweep
At midnight o?er the placid deep.
We had met in early youth,
But were forced to part, and I left my home
In the sunny South, the sea to roam.


Long years had passed, but early truth
Had not been quenched by years of pain.
Was it chance that we met again
On the vessel?s deck, on the bounding main,
So far from the land of our darkened youth 1
Could it be chance that brought us hither,
Or did some mystic law together
Bring two kindred souls again
That once had seemed to love in vain 1
Day after day, day after day, we paced along the deck,
And talked and thought of many things, but not of fire or
wreck.
We leaned upon the taffrail and watched the glimmering sea
Swiftly pass the gliding vessel, when the wind was blowing
free ;
We saw the silver stars come out, and beneath their holy
beams
We talked of future love and joy, and dreamt such glowing
dreams,
Till our spirits wandered on and on to more exalted themes?
Of a life beyond this fleeting life, of a love that never dies ;
For we had not lost our childhood?s hope of a love beyond the
skies,
And we saw the emblem of our faith?the glittering Cross?
arise,
Which all our troubled questions hushed with calm divine
replies
Of patient hope, of loving trust, and utter sacrifice;


And we watched each constellation sinking slowly
west,
Until the hasty midnight bell drove us too soon to rest,
* * * *
?Twas the hour, I said, when sailors long,
When toil is done, to sing the song
At silent eve, when the tropic day
Has in its splendour passed away.
The sun had sunk on his crystal bed,
His face with blushes overspread,
Tinging the blue with a ruddy hue
And leaving a gold and crimson dye
On the fleecy skirts of the western sky.
But a sudden change comes o?er the scene,
That dims the beauty of the night.
To windward, dark clouds roll between
The ocean?s breast and Cynthia?s light;
While far away we seemed to hear
The stifled shrieks of the storm-fiend drear,
And wails of living agony
Came trembling o?er the shuddering sea,
And a snow-white line of foam drew near.
A sudden flash?a deafening crash?
And all again is dark ;
Then the air seemed to the dazzled sight
One livid flame?in the ghastly light
Each spar and sail, each figure, shone ;
And the distant billows, capped with white,


For an instant were seen ; then all had gone
Into a gulf of fathomless night.
A breathless hush?then a wild, wild rush
Of foaming waves, as the roaring gale,
Like a fiend let loose, with a lost soul?s wail
Swept down on the gallant bark.
Like a frighted steed, before the gale
Our bark bounds wild along,
With bending mast and shredded sail,
For the blast is fierce and strong.
Harder it blows, till the raging tide
Rears a white crest on either side,
Which threatens with an angry roar
In volumes on our decks to pour ;
But when about to burst amain,
It sinks exhausted down again,
As if such threat it did but feign.
Then our captain?s voice, above the fray
Of wind and waves, is heard to shout
? Royals?top-gallants?lower away.
Some see all clear to put about,
And others by your top-sails stand.
Cheerily, oh ! lads?bear a hand.?
Still darker it grows, still harder it blows,
Still louder the sailors holla ;
Away to the leeward a hencoop goes,
And the cook is thrown upon his nose,
?Mid stifled oaths, and stifled crows,
As a rooster he tries to collar.


There is a rapture kin to awe,
That rises at the tempest?s roar?
A feeling tongue cannot impart,
That terrifies, yet thrills the heart,
As if the soul its bondage broke,
And cast for once aside the yoke
That binds it to this earthly form,
And free upon the dashing spray,
Alone with God, ?twas borne away,
And rode upon the storm.
My pulses beat?l feel?l feel,
This wild delightful terror steal
Thro? every vein like living tire.
What! would my daring soul aspire,
To roam beside that awful form,
And ride upon the howling storm ?
I felt an arm around my neck
Cling close as we stood on the trembling deck.
Hand in hand in love we glide,
Lip to lip, and side by side,
O?er the dark and foaming tide.
0 God ! it was sweet agony
To roam with her upon the sea,
When the storm had set our spirits free;
To feel that on the stormy ocean
A soul could share my soul?s emotion,
And, ?midst its outward war and din,
The peace of love could reign within.
* * * *


The sudden squall has passed away,
And sail is set on the good ship ? May
The gallant crew are gathering round
For ? grog, oh ! ? at the whistle?s sound.
But, startled by a cry, at last
They look aloft?and see a light
Like a meteor gleaming ghastly bright
On each separate towering mast?
Gone is all their jovial mirth,
They whisper round with trembling breath
Yon lights are not the lights of earth
And must portend a wreck, or death ;
But just as quickly as it came,
As if the fiend had marked his prey,
The ill-omened ghastly flame
Melted into air away.
Hark ! the sound they know so well?
Eight bells are tolling, deep and slow,
And the boatswain?s merry pipings tell
The weary watch to go below.


PART 11.
What means that tramp of hurrying feet
That rudely breaks my slumbers sweet 1
What means that strange mysterious roar
Like billows on the sounding shore 1
Fire ! Fire ! That cry?the piercing wail,
Comes floating down on the midnight gale.
I rushed up on the burning deck
?Midst falling spars and blazing wreck
My life, my love, my all, I caught?
Together thro? the flames we fought;
One moment on the rail we stood,
Then plunged beneath the fire-lit flood.
Amidst the hissing, roaring shock
I saw upon the waters rock?
Where some blazing wreckage fell?
A little boat; but how we past
The wreck and flame, and reached at last
Its side, I scarce can tell.
Three days had almost past away,
No bite of food, and not a sip
To drink had passed our cracking lip,
Still on the lonely sea we lay.


The burning sun all through the day
Had shone with fierce remorseless ray,
But now he had sunk in the western sky,
On crimson tinted clouds to lie?
Bathing with light the lazy surge,
As he lingers on the horizon?s verge
To gaze upon our misery,
E?er he dips beneath the sea.
With sudden plunge the orb has set,
But his colours have not faded yet;
His beauty lingers o?er the main,
1 As loath to yield his golden charms
' To ugly night, who creeps amain
To fold them in her dusky arms.
But dim and dimmer grows the sky;
Those heavenly tinges, erst so bright,
Slowly fade away and die
Before the breath of coming night.
Now, they?ve fled in haste away,
As suddenly evening drops between
The amber tint and golden ray
Her silvery veil, to change the scene.
Faint as a misty far-away dream,
Fair as the rainbow?s quivering beam
When silvery shower o?er the ocean weeps,
As if cruel pain could only trace
Diviner beauty on her face,
My Helen calmly sleeps.
Softly pillowed on my breast,
She lost her pain in soothing rest;


I watched her with an anxious look :
At intervals a tremor shook
Her gentle frame, that pain had made
So gaunt and altered now.
Death seemed already to have laid
His seal upon her brow.
Perhaps ?twas fancy, but I thought
Her features a strange cast had caught?
My aching eyes no more could trace
Familiar lines upon her face,
While she muttered something in her sleep
In a strange and hollow tone,
That made my very flesh to creep,
For the voice seemed not her own.
I lifted the hand I held so dear,
My own was hot, her?s icy cold.
There shot through my heart a feeling of fear?
As it fell on the thwart from my nerveless hold,
There came o?er her face a pallid hue;
That sudden change full well I knew,
For I told by her slow and painful breath
It was the hue of coming death.
As I tried to shelter her face, exposed
To the driving spray, her eyes unclosed
And looked into mine, her tender smile
Sank into my soul, and for the while
Made me forget the burning pain
That long had racked my tortured brain.
?Twas not the smile ?twas wont to be,
Like rippling waves of a summer sea ;


?Twas not the smile that?s seen so oft;
A dying smile is deep and soft?
Deep as the heavens? eternal blue
When not a cloud obstructs the view,
Soft as the beam of the moonlit sky
When a lily cloud is sailing by.
She spoke not of the distant shore
Her dying eyes would see no more;
She spoke not of, she murmured not
For all her sad untimely lot?
To die a death of lingering pain,
Far off upon the lonely main.
She said, ? Dear love, it was so sweet
On earth again at last to meet?
And thy short life was dimmed with woe
Long e?er there came this final blow ;
When thy race had first on earth begun
Thy life was like the glorious sun
As he lifts his head o?er the ocean?s verge
And bathes in light the orient surge.
But e?er he floats above the tide
The envious clouds o?er his visage ride
And all his youthful beauties hide ;
So pain and grief hath dimmed thy cheek
From the sad sweet day when first we met,
And thou hast borne it calm and meek?
But the morning gleam is lingering yet,
Though our lives shall soon in darkness set.?
My heart felt sick, I could not speak,
I stooped, and kissed her wasted cheek,
And as I bent my aching head,


With trembling, dying, voice she said?
? I go, my darling, but we shall meet
In a city bright where no' weary feet
Shall tramp on the gold of the glittering street;
There shall we live in our holy love
Of spirit marriage, in realms above,
By the river of life where never again
Shall this fiery thirst and raging pain
Burn in our heart, and throb in our brain.
I see them open the pearly door,
And the light flash up from the starry floor ?
I hear their song come over the foam,
Now borne on the breeze so full and clear,
Then dying afar on my straining ear,
* Why linger thou, loved one 1 come home, come home,
Who, with soul unmoved, can mark
The glazing eye?its dying spark?
The fading cheek?the gasping sleep?
The ghastly film, so slowly creep
Across those orbs, where once had shone
A brightness, now for ever gone 1
Thicker the film o?er her blue eyes grew?
Faint and fainter the breath she drew ?
Paler?fainter?she grew, until
There swept o?er her face a gentle thrill,
I felt her heart??twas still?so still.
I called her name?l raised her head,
It sank back on my breast like lead.
I was alone?for she was dead.


Alone ! alone with God and death,
Alone on the ocean wide,
With the sky above, and the sea beneath,
And my dead love at my side.
It is an awful sight, they say,
To watch the spirit pass away.
But when it flits like the twilight?s ray,
Slowly before the shades of night,
There is no horror in the sight.
I almost fancied I could see
Her spirit silently escape,
And, hovering o?er the trembling sea,
Assume a lovely angel?s shape.
I know not why I thought it so,
But it seemed as though ?twere loath to go
And leave me in my lonely woe.
At last?as if some unseen power
Had bidden it no longer stay ?
Like morning dew upon a flower
Beneath the sun?s increasing ray,
It melted from my sight, away.
The moon was rising slow, and threw
Its silvery beams o?er the surgeless blue,
Bathing her lovely face with a light
That made e?en gloomy death seem bright.


Though so cold and so pale on my bosom laid,
The beam like a smile o?er her features played \
For a moment I thought her soul had not fled,
As the beam lit the face of the silent dead
Upturned to the silent sky?
Her smile still there, on the cheek so fair,
But the death-film on her eye.
Slow rose the moon, till its mellow beams
With lustre fill the night,
And o?er the heaving ocean streams
A track of silvery light,
That seemed a path to the heavenly land,
Marked by a loving angel hand,
To guide my Helen?s spirit o?er
This lonely sea, unto that shore
Where cruel grief and wasting pain
Could never dim her soul again.
Angelic beauty?heavenly grace?
Were mildly stamped upon that face :
Methought such loveliness decay
Could ne?er have heart to waste away;
So sadly sweet?so passing fair,
No lingering trace of pain was there
On parted lips, or placid brow,
Or cheek that smiles for ever now.
The tears, which flowed when others died,
Were in mine eyes now scorched and dried,


I could not weep. With bitter sigh,
I turn?d away from that face so fair,
To gaze up to the silent sky ;
And the orb that hung so peaceful there,
So calm, so bright?it seemed to be
Mocking my lone misery.
That orb whose light is always shed
Alike on the living and the dead,
That shines alike with equal power
On blooming bud and withered flower?
Now shone in beauty o?er the main,
As though no lingering death of pain,
Or darksome deed, or fearful crime,
Had stained its breast from time to time.
Pale moon! how many hast thou seen?
That living, thinking souls have been?
Toil and suffer?in agony die
Under the silent pitiless sky,
Whilst thou, and the stars and the brutal frame
Of sotdless nature remain the same 1
This fiery thirst, and burning pain,
Have in my soul a madness wrought,
And together made a horrid thought
Flash through my crazkl brain,
?Gainst which I strove and prayed.
Oh God, methought, could it be harm
To taste a drop of clotted blood
I saw upon the snowy arm
That o?er my breast was laid 1


But the fit of madness quickly past,
And, lest it should come again, I stood
Upon the after thwart and cast
Her form upon the drifting flood.
With a sullen sound on the wave it splashed,
Myriad gleams on the water flashed,
And the briny spray on my forehead dashed.
I watched with awe its life-like motion,
As it rose and fell with the heaving ocean.
With horrid glee the sea-birds sing,
And o?er her flap their glistening wing.
Then wheeling round in nearer flight
They downward on her body light,
And I gazed on their feast with sick?ning sight
Till her form was lost in the gloom of night.
Again I saw the changing tide,
Ruffled by a passing breeze,
Roll in flames on either side,
And break in spangles on the seas.
The rippling sound, so sweet and clear,
Made mocking music on mine ear.
My boat rocked up and down ; and now
The fresh?ning breeze in a shower drove
The glittering spray, like a kiss of love
Cool?on my burning brow.
Sometimes methought it hard to die
Without a friend or comrade by;
To sleep unknown beneath the tide,
And none to say, ? How well he died ! ?


No hand to soothe my dying pain:
Never to see sweet home again.
Then I?d long to plunge into the blue,
To find the rest my Helen knew.
It seemed a place of rest and peace,
Where this burning pain would for ever cease?
Till I remembered that our faith
Forbade us seek untimely death.
Then I gazed on the moon, so cold and pale,
As if my woe she did bewail,
Sadly hiding her pallid cheek
Behind a drifting cloud?
As in very pity she did seek
My lonely fate to shroud?
Which, on the heaving waters, cast
A life-like shadow as it passed.
As it glided o?er the silent sea
In my solitude it seemed to be
My Helen?s soul come back to me.
But clear again the full moon shone,
And the passing shade is gone.
With wearied gaze mine eyes again
Sweep unchecked o?er the glittering main.
Merciful heavens ! Oh blessed sight!
A sail ! a sail ! looms through the night;
My pulses beat with joy and fear.
? Thank God ! Thank God, she is drawing near,
I wildly called with a frantic fear,
Lest those on deck should never hear.


I wildly called ; but she onward stood,
And heedlessly swept o?er the shining flood.
My maddened brain could hear the song
Of the gallant sailors, shrill and long?
Now full, then dying on mine ear?
As they trim the sails, and away they veer,
And they veered away as if to shun
The lone and solitary one.
And dim and dimmer to my view,
And less and less the white sails grew,
Till, like a phantom of the night,
She vanished from my aching sight.
They say, ? There is a God above :
A God of pity, a God of love,
Ruling each event below.?
I sometimes think it must be so.
Then comes a voice, ? It cannot be
That God can love and pity thee,
Ear off upon this wandering sea.?
And, what is prayer 1 Can it really alter
The will of the ever-changeless God 1
I thought so once ; but now I falter
On the steps where I firmly trod. *
Still I looked to heaven, and tried to pray
The little prayer I used to say
Long years ago at mother?s knee,
Before I sailed upon the sea.
A burden from me seemed to roll;
?I falter where I firmly trod.? ?In Memoriam.


A gusli of joy swept through my soul;
The past rushed o?er my mind ; I wept
Sweet tears of penitence?and slept.
In fields again in bliss I roved,
I saw again the form I loved ;
I felt again the cooling breeze,
That rustled through the greenwood trees.
I heard the murmuring streamlet flow,
I saw again the maiden snow ;
And with my pale and lovely guide
I reached a splashing fountain?s side.
? I?ve brought thee here,? she sweetly spake,
? Here your burning thirst to slake,?
Lip to lip we fondly prest,
I leant my head upon her breast;
But still I felt my heart oppress?d.
It seemed so hot?that place of rest.
A nameless sense of some dread ill
Kept lingering on my spirit still.
Oh God ! what is this burning pain
That steals like fire through every vein 1
And now upon the lonely sea
My darling comes tormenting me.
Filled with sparkling drink, a bowl
That thrilled my parched and longing soul
In my shrivelled hand she?d lay ;


But when my lips were on the brink,
And almost touched the cooling drink,
With mocking laugh ?twas snatched away,
Mocking demon, who art thou
With beauty written on thy brow 1
What fiend art thou that dar?st assume
The form I love, then melt in gloom ?
Slowly the dazzling sky and main
Swam round my dizzy sight again.
With misty dread I gazed around.
Not a murmur?not a sound?
Came o?er the sluggish wave.
Not a breath the sea to break,
Not a breath a hair to shake,
?Twas the silence of the grave.
No fluttering breeze o?er the ocean creeps,
The languid billow calmly sleeps,
Yet in that sleep her bosom heaved
As if in smothered pain she breathed ;
But not a breath through ether stirs
To cool that throbbing breast of hers.
I faintly called, but no reply
Fell on mine ear. There?s nothing nigh ;
O O *
Nothing but boat, and sky, and sea.
My darling Helen, where is she 1
Slowly the incidents came o?er
My wandering mind, of the day before,
And I remembered all again.
Oh God ! oh God ! my burning braiji.


XVIII.
It is so calm, so deep, so clear,
This burning, scorching, atmosphere,
And I alone am in this place,
Alone in this eternal space ?
An empty, vast, eternity,
That neither life, nor death can fill,
Nought but the deep and boundless sea,
And heavens, more deep and boundless still
Not even a lonely fleecy cloud,
To help the burning sun to shroud ;
Not even a solitary bird,
To help the wandering space to fill.
Not the faintest sound is heard,
The sea so calm, the air so still,
Not a ripple, not a breath,
Every thing is steeped in death.
Oh heavens ! it is so very lone,
With every tie of nature gone.
Eternal sea?eternal sky,
Seeming never to end or begin,
Like the awful weight of th? eternal sin*
Crushing for ever the soul within
Lay on my weary eye.
Methought I must have passed the gate
Of death, and it was now the fate
Of my spirit to stay desolate
? Mark iii. 29.? R. V.


For ever on this glassy sea,
And never more a soul to see.
Then o?er me came an awful fear,
That God Himself could not be here ;
That the last tie was from me reft,
And my soul it was for ever left
Alone?alone?upon this sea,
Which seemed the universe to be,
And held no other soul but me.
Ho other soul my woe to share,
Ho living God to hear my prayer,
Or even know that I am here.
Yet I was wont to feel Him near
On the lonely sea, and my soul would quail
When I thought His form swept by on the gale,
But now no fear, no hope?despair
Had darkened all that once was fair.
Oh, for a drifting cloud, a speck
This deep eternal space to check,
A wavelet?s crest?a sea-bird?s wing,
O'
A passing breeze?or anything ;
Hought to see but the blazing sun,
And that I could not look upon.
If e?en that unseen orb would set,
I might feel that God is near me yet.
Oh, Heavenly Father, must it be,
That I suffer on in agony,
Alone?alone?upon this sea ?


Can this be the thirst of which they tell,
The burning thirst in the endless hell 1
Shall endless ages roll away,
And this scorching thirst within me stay,
And bring no end to the maddening pain
That racks and burns my tortured brain 1
Have mercy, Lord?tho? I have been
A sinner vile?oh, let me lean
Still on Thy love ?oh, Father, hear
Thy child? for still I am Thy child ;
Though darkened, and by sin defiled,
Thine offspring. Oh, if Thou art near,
Great Father, let me feel Thee here.
For to he it is an awful lot,
In a place where Thou art not.
?Twere nought if mortal forms had gone,
But the living soul alone?alone?
I Oh God ! that was an awful thought,
And madness in my brain it wrought.
Still the same came day and night
Upon my aching dizzy sight,
Out of the sea the red sun came,
And sank in the west with a crimson flame ;
I felt the hot and scorching blast,
I heard the waves go rippling past,
Still I felt the burning pain,
Throbbing dully on my brain.
Then thoughts disjointed?undefined?
Came surging through my struggling mind:


I seemed to see sweet home again,
The distant hills, the sunburnt plain,
The eucalypti?s shady lane ;
The tender glance of a love-lit eye ;
The deep dark-bljue Australian sky,
The fleecy cloudlets sailing by.
And I heard the magpie?s sweet wild cry,
But I strove in vain to hold that dream
That flickered like a passing gleam,
And then was lost amidst the night
That fell around my straining sight.
Sometimes a dim and grisly shape
Would through the gloom upon me gape :
Then across my startled sight
Bright creatures flash with heavenly light;
Then shadowy forms of loathsome things
Would flit around on darkened wings;
O J
I heard their voices, overhead,
Wail and moan as they came and fled;
I saw from out the darkness glare
Two livid eyes, but could not dare
To look again on the horrid shape
From which my soul could not escape.
Then round my boat in mazy dance
Dark spirits moved?until a trance
Came slow, like darkness of the tomb
Falling down in deeper gloom,


Until it seemed my soul to sweep,
With whirlwind speed, adown a deep
Dark gulf, with sides so black and steep.
I saw far off a glimmering spark,
But all around was dark, so dark.
In vain I strove, with aching sight,
To stare away the ugly night,
For o?er me came a sluggish mood,
A deadly dismal solitude.
While the far-off dread of some vague ill
Kept lingering on my spirit still,
Then a sunless, starless, blank
Upon my sick?ning spirit sank ;
Darker grew the clouds that crossed
My sight, till sight and thought were lost.
* * * *
XXIII.
As orient morn with shadowy light
Steals on the lifting gloom of night,
And darkness slowly takes its flight,
So by degrees my drifting rack
Of scattered thoughts came wandering back,
I was no longer on the flood,
And dusky forms around me stood.
A cooling potion touched my lips ;
I saw again the ropes of ships.
Was I alive I ?Did I breathe
The air around this earth beneath ?
Are these human forms around ?
Was that a human voice, that sound


That thrilled upon my raptured ears
Like music heard in far-off years,
Bringing a flood of happy tears 1
They told me that my boat and me
They found upon the lonely sea.
How many days had o?er me flown,
Into what regions I had gone
Whilst in that boat, were never known.
XXIV.
But I am left to roam alone
This earth, for its last tie is gone.
Wasteful billows roll above
Her form?the form that bore me love.
Oh ! would she had an earthly bed,
I then might deck her lowly head
With the wild Australian flowers
We loved to cull in childhood?s hours.
But she sleeps where sun has never shone,
Where never a floweret grew.
Alas ! that bed is cold and lone
For a heart so warm and true.
When the spirit of night begins to weave
A silvery shroud for the corpse of eve?


Or, on the lonely sea at deep midnight,
When the moon looks down with her holy light
Like a soul redeemed, so pure and white,
And sadly smiles on the shining surge?
I hear a soft and solemn dirge
Borne on the breeze as it swells o?er the foam,
? Why linger, thou lov?d one 1 come home ! come home !?
The song seems to come from a far-away land,
Chanted by one of the heavenly band.
Sweetly and clearly it swells o?er the foam.
Why linger, thou lov?d one 1 come home ! come home !
Thy garments are thin. ?Tis lonely and weary,
And the blasts of the ocean are cold and so dreary.
He will clothe thee in garments, love, whiter than foam.
Why linger, thou lov?d one 1 come home ! come home !
Why linger, thou lov?d one, o?er dark billows roaming 1
The daylight has vanished, and shadows have come.
The night dews fall on thee so chill in the gloaming.
The tempest is lowering. Come home ! come home !
?Tis lonely and sad, on the dark stormy sea,
With no one to love, and none to love thee.
Why linger, thou lov?d one 1 ?Tis weary to roam
So lonely and loveless. Come home ! come home !
He came from His glory, His lov?d to deliver.
In His blood He has washed us more white than the foam.
Hark ! His voice ; it is borne on the breeze o?er the river.
I wait for the lov?d one. Come home ! come home !


O Helen, darling Helen, I hear thy spirit call ;
Thy soft, solemn, song comes o?er the list?ning sea ;
Softer than the silent dews that on the ocean fall
Solemn as mysterious death, that keeps my soul from thee.
I come, I come ; though the way be dark and wild;
Through lonely days and nights, o?er many a stormy sea;
Till ocean, mother ocean, folds her arms around her child,
And I sleep beneath her heaving breast, for ever love with
thee.
xxvi.
No longer alone. I know that she?
In spirit?now must ever be
Hovering near on land or sea
To one she loved on earth so well,
And death itself cannot divide
Her spirit from her lover?s side.
And blessing?more than tongue can tell?
Her death hath surely been to me;
For she hath gone to heaven to dwell?
? Where your treasure, is your heart will be.?
The years shall pass, and we shall meet
At the golden porch. On the glittering street
We shall walk in a love more pure and sweet
Than a love on earth could ever be,
Though whiter than snow in its purity.
XXVII.
Once I thought it might be so ;
But now I know there?s a God above?


A God of pity, a God of love?
Ruling events on earth below,
And through the anguish, toil, despair,
My struggling spirit had to bear,
Far-off, upon the lonely sea,
He was loving, pitying me,
Guiding, teaching, leading me
To rest and love in eternity !
And I mix once more with humankind
To the will of a living God resigned,
An omnipotent will, that wills all for the best;
Why not in the will of the All-wise rest
In patience awaiting th? eternal love
Towards which all kindred spirits move 1

THOU ART GONE.
Thou art gone ! thou art gone ! and must never return !
I shall greet thee no more on the morrow.
Oh, why do I weep that thou didst not sojourn
In this world of darkness and sorrow 1
Now hushed is the voice that first whispered the story
Of love and of fame in my too willing ear.
And clouded with sorrow is earth, and its glory
Has faded, for beauty has wandered from here.
I saw the pale lily hang drooping with sorrow,
In her garments of purity weeping.
The Angel of Death swept by on the morrow,
And beauty in ashes is sleeping !
Now, ?tis lonely and sad in the midst of mirth,
?Tis weary with nowhere to rest.
Oh, death ! thou hast kissed the beauty of earth,
And she sleeps on thy cold dark breast.
Ne?er again in this world, thy soft strains shall come o?er
My soul, for the minstrel is mute !
And the magic of music shall haunt me no more,
For the wild notes I loved are hushed on thy lute.


Tell me not; tell me not, death?s billows roll
Between our love for ever,
For we loved with a love that was love of the soul,
With a love that dieth never.
I shall see thee again with thy beautiful smile,
Ere the flowers of poesy wither ;
And the beauty of earth may linger awhile
Till I sleep on thy bosom for ever.
A DISAPPOINTED HOPE.
Methought the flowers of earth so fair
As they dripped with the glistening dew,
I saw a musk rose in the sun-beamy air
And violets pied and blue.
But a blast swept by, and the morning sky
Grew dark, while the musk rose shivered.
Its petals were torn by the driving rain,
And its beauty was never the same again,
And the violets drooped and withered.


LINES
Suggested by hearing .of a Missionary?s wife and child
drowned on their way to England .
I Soft and low ; soft and low,
The murmuring breezes gently blow,
i That through the shrouds and cordage play,
Bearing the loved ones far away.
Over the ocean wide and wild.
Pray for them ! Pray for them !
Mother and child.
Fierce and strong ; fierce and strong,
The hurricane sweeps the barque along,
Laughing aloud with fiendish glee,
As scores are plunged ?neath the pitiless sea,
The stained with sin and the undefiled,
Friend and lover,
Mother and child.
A stifled groan from a broken heart.
Oh God ! Oh God ! ?tis bitter to part.
Thy will be done, whate?er it be !
Mother and child are now with Thee,
In garments white and undefiled.
Weep for them ! Weep for them !
Mother and child !


MOONRISE.
Thy wavelets are silently breaking
In the east with a glittering gleam,
As if angels their pinions were shaking
O?er the pale moon?s rising beam,
Bright sea,
O?er the pale moon?s rising beam.
It seems as if Cynthia wished
To rest on thy bosom to-night,
And she envied the zephyr that kissed
Thy cheek ?neath her silent light,
Bright sea,
Thy cheek ?neath her silent light.
But slowly she climbs from the deep,
A last good-night kiss stealing,
Ere you sink to a murmuring sleep,
With her light o?er your pale face streaming,
Calm sea,
With her light o?er your pale face streaming.
But the clouds to a storm gave birth,
And the garments of darkness they wore,
Eloated down o?er thy beauty like sin o?er the earth,
And I saw the sweet vision no more,
Dark sea,
I saw the sweet vision no more.


And she has gone to realms above,
From earth for ever fled;
And who can tell how much we love,
Till those we loved are dead 1
No, ?tis not wrong, dear friend, to weep,
For Christ, with tearful eyes,
Hath stood where Lazarus lay asleep,
Though He knew that His friend would rise.


LINES
On reading an account of a Shipwreck, in which a Friend of the
Author's perished.
Now gracefully, gallantly, dancing along
With the breeze for her music, and the waves for her song ;
In the hour of her glory, in the prime of her pride,
Sweeps the brave bark o?er the rippling tide.
Now, rent to shreds is the canvas sail,
And shivered the towering mast;
And planks are swept before the gale,
Like chaff before the blast.
That bright, gallant form. Oh ! where is it now 1
?Neath the cold dark ocean lying,
With the dank sea-weed around his brow,
And the gale above him sighing.
No cypress or willow shall bloom o?er his pillow,
And wave in the breezes free;
Nor throw their light shade where low he is laid
Deep, deep, ?neath the rolling sea.
Fare thee well, brother sailor, the ocean?s bright daughters
Shall deck thy lone grave with the flow?rs of the sea.
With its gems they shall brighten thy tomb ?neath the waters,
And carol sweet anthems around thee.


EVER DRIFTING.
Ever drifting; ever drifting
Over a dark and silent sea,
Where the fog and mist seem never lifting?
Never lifting?never lifting
For a ray of light to fall on me.
All dark behind, and not a gleam
Ahead the heavy gloom to break.
All life a dreary dismal dream.
Oh God ! What if I never wake 1
What is death 1 Is it only a sleep
Stealing away our sense and sight
For a little while 1 Shall we wake from that deep,
Deep rest, in a land of endless light 1
Or, is it a sleep that shall never end,
A night that shall never cease 1
I almost wished that God would send
Into my soul such a dreamless peace.
For the thought of a rushing, endless life,
Was almost like despair.
For ever, for ever, its weary strife
Seemed greater than I could bear.


And my spirit longed to linger and rest
On the tide of the restless sea,
That onward, for ever sweeps onward
Through the deeps of eternity.
But now, like Paul, I rejoice in the strife
That every soul must share,
And the thought that there is no future life,
O Christ, would be despair.
For Thy loving words, Thy perfect deeds,
Have given my soul new birth.
How I see through the mist of human creeds,
The life of God on earth.
Thou hast given to me desire and strength
To work, and not despair.
For man may reach by Thee at length
The perfect good and fair.
And now new joys are opening round
The soul, from doubt set free,
There springs from every sight and sound
Delight and harmony.


WHAT IS TRUTH?
? 1 Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth ? And when he had said
this he went out.??John xviii. 38.
? What is truth ?? asks the sneering sceptic,
But he does not wish to know.
Ere truth itself can make reply,
Like Pilate, he turns to go.
? What is truth ? ? is the agonized cry
Of thousands here below.
? Midst all their systems, forms, and shams,
Oh, who the truth can know ? ?
? While the sins of the past rise before us
And darken our holiest deeds.
While the shadow of death hangs o?er us,
They wrangle and fight o?er their creeds.?
The way to knowledge and truth is still
The same as ?twas years ago ?
? If any one willeth to do His will,
That soul the truth shall know.?*
Time may change our forms and creeds,
Heaven and earth decay,
But the loveliness of holy deeds
Can never pass away.
* John vii. 17. ?? If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know
of the doctrine.?


I see the home where?er I roam,
And watch the well-known scene ;
I?m there, I seem, in fancy?s dream,
Though oceans roll between.
I think of the time in weather fine
Of sports we had so gay.
Those scenes float back o?er memory?s track,
As though ?twere yesterday.
But the time has past we thought would last
In youthful dreams so bright,
The golden ray of parting day
Has melted into night;
But the morrow?s sun of hope will come,
And darkness pass away.
E?en now so bright with beams so light,
I see the coming day.
I think of thee whilst on the sea,
Or in the foreign land,
And sigh once more for the long left shore,
From Siam?s burning strand.
The school-boy day, with romp and play,
I see from the alien shore.
?Neath tropic skies these mem?ries rise
As freshly as of yore.


Blow, winds, along, and waft my song
Far o?er the billows? foam.
Where?er it find thee ?twill remind thee
Of happy days at home.
Yes, it does seem just like a dream
Whilst roaming far away,
The time floats back o?er memory?s track
As though ?twere yesterday.
The bright blue sky, and the palm tree high,
Seem beautiful to me,
And I love to ride o?er the stormy tide,
And gaze on the placid sea.
But one glimpse of the home, far over the foam.
The home that shelters thee,
Is a lovelier sight than the sky so bright,
The waving palm, or the deep blue sea.
But soon, once more, I?ll tread the shore,
That lies far o?er the main,
Revisit scenes I see in dreams,
And shake your hand again.
Once more, old boy, with heartfelt joy
I?ll see your face so gay,
When the time has fled that?s now ahead,
And melts to yesterday.
Bangkok, Siam, 2ith May, 1876.


THE DYING SAILOR BOY.
I am dying, mother, dying?
Far away from home and thee,
In my lonely hammock lying
On the dark and stormy sea.
Still I feel thy spirit near,
Though life is ebbing fast;
And hark ! thy loving voice I hear?
Low, on the wailing blast.
I hear it, in the dusky gloaming,
Sweetly whispering to the blast:
? Blow gently where my Willie?s roaming,
And waft him to his home at last.?
But now thou?lt whisper to the dashing wave
? Roll gently o?er my darling?s head.
Sigh, softest zephyrs, o?er his grave,
And ruffle not his lonely bed.?
Though I am dying, mother, dying,
Away on the lone, lone, sea,
I hear a sweet voice sighing?
? That rock was cleft for thee.?
I?m dying, Saviour, dying;
Soon my spirit shall be free,
And the veil that dims it lying
?Neath the dark and stormy sea.


The wild waves wash o?er the gallant bark,
The lightnings flash through the midnight dark,
The storm through the shrouds is sighing,
And its mournful wail
Floats down on the gale,
Where your sailor boy lies dying.
Pale Cynthia shall weep from her silvery throne,
And smile when the wavelets sadly moan,
Or sighs the heaving billow.
But darkly she?ll frown on the ruthless tide,
And ?neath murky clouds her beauty hide,
When it storms o?er my lonely pillow.
No footsteps o?er my grave shall tread,
Above no blooming flow?rs shall spread
Or garland o?er me wreath ;
But rank weeds shall twine
Through the cold, cold brine
Round my canvas shroud beneath.
There will no sweet remembrance tell,
That one fond heart had loved so well,
Or ever beat for me ;
For who can place a tombstone there,
And deck my grave with the roses fair
On the breast of the heaving sea ?
No loving lips to kiss the tear
That softly falls for one not here,
And drowns my failing breath.


No loving face, or form is near.
No loving voice my soul to cheer?
Ere fall the shades of death.
Lonely droops the wither?d flower.
None to soothe my dying hour,
Or speak a parting word,
When other sounds have died away,
Like the angel?s distant lay,
That last farewell is heard.
The dusky wings of death are o?er me.
Gloomy clouds float thick before me.
The soft light slowly fades.
But suddenly a gleam of light
Rends the sable clouds of night,
And fills the heavy shades.
Reft aside, the clouds unfold
Angels decked with ? downy gold,?
And from their eyes, so melting bright,
Seraphic beauty beams;
While o?er their forms so glorious, streams
A flood of living light.
Oh ! hark my soul, the songs I hear
Of the angels drawing near.
Now soft on the wailing blast?
Now borne aloft?so sweet and clear;
Then, dying on my straining ear,
The storm alone howls past.


They?re fading, mother, fading;
>
Melting softly from my sight,
O?er their golden light are falling fast
The shades of gloomy night.
They?ve faded into dusky night,
Once more I?m left alone ;
Those angels bright in robes of light
From my lingering gaze have flown.
Those heavenly visions have melted away,
Like the golden beams of the dying day,
And darkness wraps my soul.
The heavy gloom absorbs my breath,
And o?er my sight the clouds of death
In mingled volumes roll.
Yet, soft! methinks I hear again
The holy angels? silvery strain
As waking out of sleep,
Its murmuring sound first creeping o?er,
Then swelling richly as before,
Across the stormy deep.
The mingling song through ether rings,
And riding on the tempest?s wings,
In golden stream is borne along,
Flooding o?er my ravished sense ;
It sweeps my parting spirit hence
To realms of endless song.
But I feel a cold and icy breath,
Falling soft in dews of death
Chill on my burning brow,


Dim and dusky forms surround me.
The veil is falling closer round me.
I see the angels now.
They?re waiting, mother, waiting,
Lingering gently by my side,
On their golden wings to bear me,
Across yon gloomy tide.
The dim cloud is creeping o?er me,
I feel it drawing nigh,
But they?re coming now, those angels bright,
Good-bye, shipmates, good-bye.
And a garland was placed on the brow of the youth,
As amends to slandered virtue and truth,
For in life was the claim denied,
And he wandered away from his friends and his home
Far away, far away, the dark ocean to roam,
And died on the stormy tide.
Oh, let one pearly tear be shed
From beauty?s eye o?er that lonely bed,
Where truth lies silent now.
For the cold, cold waves,
The garland laves
That wraps his youthful brow.
Hong-kong, November, 1876.


THE FUNERAL.
With trembling voice the captain read
The solemn service for the dead
We stood with bowed, uncovered head,
In silent grief, until he said,
? We commit his body to the deep.?
Then I saw each reckless sailor weep,
And knew that ?neath their forms so rude,
Deep hidden, lay a softer mood ;
A mood that only can be seen
By one who many years hath been
On land or ocean forced to roam,
And with such natures made his home ;
A mood, I knew, that could be wrought
From low desire to holiest thought.
I loved them for the tears they shed,
As they bore the shroud with its shot of lead
To the gangway near, with reverent tread?
A sullen plunge?and all was o?er,
And the ship sailed on to the foreign shore,
But little ? Will ? shall be seen no more
? Till the sea gives up her dead.?


REST.
?Fecisti nos ad te et inquietum est cor nostrum, donee requiescat
in te.? ?St. Augustine.*
Listen, 0 Lord Jesus, to a tired child feebly crying
For that rest and peace that seems to come from Thee ;
Doubting, darkened, sinful, still on Thy human heart relying,
From my burthen and my bondage, 0 Jesus set me free.
Though hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless
till
They yield to Thine almighty will?Thy will of boundless love.
Take, 0 take, my Saviour, this sinful, selfish will,
And mould it to the holy will, that rules in realms above.
Rest, weary child, to thy Saviour?s promise clinging ?
Rest, for the dark night soon must wear away ;
? And then the night of weeping shall be the morn of singing,?
And o?er thy dark and dreary path shall break the cloudless
Rest, weary head, on thy Father?s bosom lying,
Rest, free from every anxious pain;
Cease, aching heart, thy vain and faithless sighing,
Thy Father folds His wandering child safe in His arms again.
* ?Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless, till
they rest in Thee.? ?St. Augustine.


THINE FOR EYER.
? That he may continue Thine for ever.? ?The Order of Confirmation.
Thine for ever, never again
Shall my heart be sad with an aching pain ;
Thine for ever, at last I rest;
Infinite Father, upon Thy breast.
Thine for ever, take my will,
Mould it to Thine own, until
My life flows in harmonious verse
With the will that rules the universe.
Thine for ever, washed from sin,
Thine, O Christ, made pure within ;
Thine for ever, now to be
Thine for all eternity.
Thine for ever?Spirit blest,
In Thy temple take thy rest;
Each thought ennoble, purify,
Each word and action sanctify.
Thine for ever, three in one,
Finish the work in my soul begun,
While unto Thee be all the merit,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.


A THOUGHT.
I love the wild yet beauteous sea,
That vast, lone, watery wilderness,
For only there can nature be
Seen in her naked loveliness.
But the glittering sea, ?neath the pale moonlight,
Is a holy, awe-inspiring sight.
Who hath gazed from deck or mast
Upon that vacant, wandering vast,
Nor longed for the time when his soul shall sweep
Swift as thought, o?er the trackless deep,
Nor yearned for burning words to tell
The thoughts his soul could feel so well,
Nor felt how dull is mortal speech
Another living soul to reach,
When feeble words, in weakness wrought,
Come staggering ?neath some mighty thought 1
Yet, though the soul should never tell
In life, the thoughts that in it dwell,
And through the world unheard we steal,
0 God, Thou knowest the thoughts we feel.
0, for the time when the soul no more
By passion and sense is clouded o?er;
When this dark veil is torn away,
And every thought shall see the day
When thought to thought, from soul to soul,
Shall sweep through space without control.


And shall the soul so naked be,
With sinful stain and damning brand,
Side by side to trembling stand
With awful purity * * *
WHAT ARE THE WINDS SAYING?
?0, ye winds of God, bless ye the Lord
ever. " ? Benedidte.
Soft, soft wind through the trembling cordage stealing?
Wandering like an angel, unseen across the sea,
Thy sad dreamy chant my holiest thoughts revealing,
Would that I could sing the song thy spirit sings to me.
Wild, wild wind across the ocean roaring,
Wailing through the cordage like a soul in agony,
Into my lonely soul thy strange weird music pouring,
Would that I could sing the woes thy spirit sings to me.


A RECOLLECTION.
There is some mystic law that draws
Soul to soul, and heart to heart;
But it seems as if some higher power
Hath borne our lives apart.
Like ships that meet, with all sail set,
At night upon the moonless main,
Our souls on some dark ocean met?
And parted. We shall meet again.
It may be on this earth, it may
Be somewhere in eternity,
When side by side we stand and say?
Sweet love, for long I?ve looked for thee.


?FOLLOW ME.?
Matt. xvi. 24.
Follow Thee ! 0 Jesus, can we tread
Along the path Thy sacred feet have trod,
Follow one, whose perfect actions shed
A halo round th? incarnate life of God 1
Follow?like some that have with martyr?s eye
Looked right beyond the death of pain, and thought
How sweet and beautiful it is to die
For love of Jesus, who our souls hath bought.
Follow Thee ! 0 Lord, help me to tread,
If ?tis Thy will, the path which Thou hast trod;
Follow Thee with cross and thorn-crowned head;
The path of pain must lead us near to God.


THE LORD IN THE MIGHT OF HIS ANGER HATH
SPREAD.
Lam. ii. 1. Isaiah xxxv. 10.
The Lord in the might of His anger hath spread, *
O daughter of Zion ! a cloud o?er thy head,
And the beauty of Israel, that tower?d to the skies,
In the dust of the earth all withered lies.
Thy city the Lord once delighted to own,
But He scattered His people and shivered His throne.
And now but the tread of the stranger profanes
Thy still sacred and holy, though desolate, plains.
Though His people are scattered o?er Babylon?s plains,
Still Israel?s defender omnipotent reigns,
And the lily again shall thy valleys adorn,
And the ransomed of God rejoicing return.


A PRAYER.
Great Spirit of the universe,
Unseen by mortal eyes,
Thou art holy, make me holy ;
Thou art wise, O make me wise.
Thou art Almighty, let my soul
In this assurance rest
That thine Almighty, loving will
Is working for the best.
In Thee alone we live and move,
Our spirits are Thy breath,
Give faith on earth to trust Thy love,
Give hope for sight in death.
Thou art ? Our Father,? give us grace
To live as did Thy Son,
And say like Him, whate?er our lot,
? Father, Thy will be done.?


LINES TO MY BIBLE CLASS ON LEAVING COONAMBLE.
LINES
To my Bible Class on Leaving Coonamhle.
When I am gone you?ll sometimes think of me,
And pray for one who in his weakness strove
To preach the truth that makes the sin-bound free,
And lead to Him whose words and deeds were love.
Then fare ye well! we may not meet again ;
Yet we may meet, for e?en death cannot sever
Our deathless spirits. We may meet to reign
As kings and priests for ever and for ever.
