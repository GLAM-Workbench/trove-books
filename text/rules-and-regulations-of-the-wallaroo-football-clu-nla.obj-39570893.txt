order to take such kick, he may go as far back as
he pleases, and no player on the opposite side
shall advance beyond his mark till he has kicked.
IX.
Charging is fair in case of a place kick as soon

DEFINITIONS OF TERMS.
A Place Kick is a kick at the ball while it is
on the ground, in any position in which the
kicker may choose to hare it placed.
A Free Kick is the privilege of kicking the ball
without obstruction, in such manner as the kicker
may tliink fit (except a place kick).
Hacking is kicking an enemy intentionally.
Touch is that part of the field, on either side of
the ground, which is beyond the line of flags.
Sun in is when a player takes the ball and
manage*’ to run with it, and touch it down to the
ground behind the enemy’s goal line, he may
then take it to the front and try to kick a goal.
Try at goal. If the touch down be near
enough to try a goal, then two of the side that
touched it down are deputed by the head of the


side to take it out—one to place the ball on the
ground, the other to kick it. Then he who is
going to kick it, takes it up, brings it to the line
of goal, and touches it down intide or on the
goal-line, and in a line with the place at which
the player who ran in touched it down : if the
runner in touched it down between the posts, he
touches it down at either of the posts. ile then
makes a mark with his heel on the spot, taking
care all the time to keep within the line of goal,
and touches it down in that mark. The players
of the opposite side may then come as far as the
mark, and no farther, and may stretch forward
with a view of mauling the two who are taking it
out, if they do not succeed in the following action.
The player who is to place kick, goes just out of
the reach of the opposite side who are stretching
forward. He then, still standing within tlie goal-
line, punts the ball gently otf his toe or knee into
the hands of the other, who is standing just out-
side the goal-line to receive it. The moment it is
in his hands, he makes a mark with bis heel
outside the goal-line, and, of course, as far as he
can stretch in the direction of the goal posts,
which his opponents may prevent if they can by
charging, but not until the ball has left the knee
or toe of the player behind the goal-line.—(This
is called Mauling). This however they cannot


do when he has made his mark, so that only in
cases where they prevent his catching the ball, or
he fails in making his mark directly, or makes it
inside goal-line, or touches the ball before it is off
the knee or toe of the other, do they succeed in
mauling him. When he has made his mark, he
carries the ball out in a line with the mark at
right angles to the goal-line, until it is at a
suitable distance from the goal for a place kick.
A small nick is then made in the ground for the
ball to rest upon, and in it he places the ball. If
however the ball be touched when once outside
goal by any but the player who is taking it out,
the other side may charge or maul. The ball
being placed in the nick, the kicker takes a place
kick at it. The moment the ball is on the ground
the other side may charge from a line drawn
through the mark made by the player who took
it out parallel to the goal-line; but the kicker’s
side may not charge till the ball is actually
kicked, and must all stand behind or on a level
with the ball in accordance with the rules of On
aide. If the ball goes over the cross-bar, whether
it touches or not at whatever height, it is a goal.
If it rises directly over the end of one of the
posts, it is called & poster, and is no goal.


A Punt is when the ball is taken in the hands,
let fall and kicked before reaching the ground.
A Drop Kick is when the ball is taken in the
hands, let fall and kicked the moment it touches
the ground.
A Maul outside goal-line takes place when a
player holding the ball is held by one or more
players of the opposite side, and if he cannot get
free of them, or give the ball to some other of his
own side (not in front of him) who can run with
it, he cries, “ Have it down,” when
A scrimmage commences, i.e., the holder puts
the ball down on the ground and all who have
closed round on their respective sides begin
kicking at the ball.
