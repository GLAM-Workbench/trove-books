SCIENTIFIC AND lIS
MANIFOLD AVENUES.
Last evening, the Rev. Mr, Garlick of Al!
Saints, delivered a most interesting lecture,
under the above heading, in the lecture room of
the School of Mines. The attendance, however,
Was not by any means Commensurate with tbe
merits of the deliverance, there not being rtiore
than 50 persons present, including a goodly
portion of ladies. Mr. A. Bayne, President of
the School of Mines, occupied the chair, and
with a few appropriate remarks, introduced the
lecturer, who said
I have undertaken to lecture to night upon a
su ' j r / -� Hut b a,; wide, nay wider than the
For in the purview that the
title of my lecture covers, must be comprehen-
ded the vast field of human knowledge, which
seeksto ba 00-extensive with, and is as far
reaching assail material structures, properties
or forces that are to he found ?in the heavens
above, in the earth beneath, and in the water?s
under the earth, ? the strict accepta-
tion of the term, means knowledge, and
in its fullest aud widest sense it takes cognisance
of ? all things knowable.? It has for its realm
the investigation of nature and nature?s laws,
both simple aud complex, and also the scrutiny
of all records of experience. The domains of
?science,? properly so-called, are as wide as are
the almost limitless boundaries of research into
all that is and can be known of those forces
and laws by which all materials in the universe
are regulated and governed. Strictly speak-
ing, it is not to mere theoretical specula-
tion about such materials, forces and
laws, but by ascertained, positive aud abso-
lute facts established beyond dispute, that !
the term ? science? is rightly applied : but
practically the word as defined by the lexico-
graphers is used in numerous narrower senses,
either with or without other qualifying words
to express divisions and subdivisions of the
whole, and so Is made to denominate almost
every conceivable subject that may be presented i
to the mind as a distinct or special study. Ac-
cordingly, while our forefathers reckoned the
sciences as seven?viz., grammar, logic, rhe
toric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,
and music, so great has been the growth and so




wide the spread of knowledge,that now it would
be difficult, if not impossible, to state how
many there are. One authority tells us that
this difficulty eitezlds also to their classification,
? According to the different ways of regarding
them,? says the writer under this head in the
Popular Encyclopedia, ? they may be broadly
divided into theoretic ,or pure and applied, or
practical, synthetic and analytic, deductive and
inductive,or otherwise.? Applied science, he
defines as a knowledge of facts, events or
phenomena, as explained, acoeunted for or pro
duoed by means of powers, causes or laws; pure
science as the knowledge of these powers,
causes or laws, considered apart from
all applications. The practical sciences are the
application of scientifically obtained facts and
laws to some practical end. To the class of
pure and fundamental sciences belong mathe-
matics, physios, chemistry, biolegy, or vegetable
and animal physiology, and psychology; to the
applied or concrete belong geology, mineralogy,
botany, zoology, meteorology, geography and a
host of others. The fundamental sciences have
definite sequence. Mathematics oomss
first, because dealing, as it does, with quantity,
it is independent of all other sciences, and yet,
though it does not borrow from any of them, its
laws underlie them all, It may be said that
upon the^ four rules of arithmetic, and the
definitions? and axioms of Euclid, the magni-
ficent of modern science has been
raised. Closely connected with mathematics is
physios or natural philosophy, which embraces
two _ distinct branches, molar and molecular
physi/, the former including mechanics
hydrostatics, hydraulics, acoustics, pneumatics
and astronomy,{and the latter heat, light and
electricity, Chemistry succeeds physios, for it
assumes all the physical laws as they are
known. Biology involves the laws of the three
preceding sciences in addition to the more special
laws of the science itself, the vital laws as they
are commonly called. Psychology, or the
science of the mind, is separated by a wide gulf
from any of the foregoing, though from its con-
nection with our erganism it is more or less
intimately associated with physiology.
Sociology, or the laws of man in society, is by
some reckoned as a sixth fundamental science!?
These classified ' sciences, which I have
enumerated from the authority I named just
now, may be regarded as the foundation
on which rest those varied practical
sciences which, as they are ever multi-
plying with the requirements of human
life,can have no limit assigned to their numbers
or to the fields covered by their research. I
shall presently have occasion to refsr more par-
ticularly and in detail to some of these practical
sciences that have contributed so largely to
commerce, to civilisation, and to the comfort cf




human life. But let me say first,that in taking
upon myself to speak to you upon the subject of
scientific research, and in referring to its many
avenues, I feel myself in a positiom somewhat
similar to that which a stranger coming to our
shores inight occupy, who, after a general ob-
servation of us in our various walks of life,
should undertake to write his impressions about
our habits, #ur attainments and prospects,
though he - might have *very little personal
knowledge of us as individuals. I undertake no
more than to deal in a broad and general way
with my subject, indicating as far as I am able
ths principles that in my opinion should under-
lie, and the beneficial results that may be ex
pected to follow, all patient, industrious and
honest enquiry. I do not presume to enter upon
a discussion of the persistent and laborious
studies of the specialist, though I do not hesi-
tate for a passing moment to introduce myself
as a visitor into his sanctum. Rapidly travers-
ing the ground which I propose my lecture shall
cover, I shall of necessity be compelled to take
but a very cursory glance at the concentrated
efforts and the results that have rewarded them,
of well-trained, busy brain-and-hand
workers in|life?s hive whojhave made the world*#
accumulated fund of knowledge the grand and
valuable capital that it is to-day in the world?s
economj. I assume that but few of those who
come to hear lectures delivered under the aus-
pices of the School of Mines will claim to be
learned in the sciences. I for one at once
frankly admit that I make no pretentious t# be
so, and therefore I shall studiously avoid any
criticisms as to the methods by which any
particular scientific facts are established or as to
the scientific reasons that are assigned
for certain theories that have been propounded
by the great men who have taken the lead
amongst the scientists of the present amd past
generation. The object of the School of Mines
and of all such kindred institutions, and of
delivered in connection with them is,
I conceive, to awaken among persons engaged
in the ordinary pursuits of life, and especially
amongst the rising generation �f young men
and women,who should be equipping themselves
as best they can for the struggle in the battle of
life, a more than passing interest in some branch
or other of scientific enquiry, and suffer me to
say to those of my audience who may possibly
be students in the School �f Mines, that in such
an institution as this you have facilities for ac-
quiring scientific knowledge which wo of the
passing generation were never privileged to
enjoy. In such teaching, so conveniently and
so cheaply brought to your very doors, you
have a boon that you should prize as of inesti-
mable value to you. In the multiplicity of
those grand and helpful schools of scientific
learning, which being the most useful culture




within easy reach of the masses of the people,
we are realising what has been the ideal of such
men as Brewster, Owen, Hamilton, Tyndall,
Huxley, and a host of other kindred spirits,
who have contended bravely and nobly for it in
the battles that have raged round education
during the last half century. It has been said,
and the saying has come to be regarded as a
wise maxim;??A little knowledge is a dan-
gerous thing,?butithe weight attached to this as-
sertion,and indeed to most such like sayings, must
depend upon the absence or presence of modifying
condition. In this case, e.g., if we have the
wisdom to know how little our knowledge is
then all danger vanishes, and our stock of in-
formation must be advantageously augmented.
I might illustrate this in numerous ways,# g., a
child may have very limited knowledge as to the
terrible ravages that fire is capable of causing,
yet the recollection of a burnt finger, however
slight the scorch, may still he sufficient to in-
duce a wholesome dread of that most excellent
iservant but devastating master. On the other
hand, the knowledge that gunpowder will ex-
plode may lead, if unaccompanied by a due
sense of danger, to the most disastrous conse-
quences; b

naturalist club or in
'hly do the de-
sfcructive work of pulling to pieces ; very little
knowledge will suffice to produce in the one
case a little heap of disjointed wings and legs,
muscles and nerves, and in the other a useless
collection of wheels and pinions and plates ; but
to reconstruct or to rightly understand and be
able to explain the relations of one part to an-
other, and the manner of its action, would
require for the one a Huxley, and for the other
an expert from some such factory as that of the
great Walthanj/Company in America. But the
inability of the novice in these examples I have
mentioned to compete with the expert is ro
proof that a slight insight into anatomy or horo-
logy is dangerous. The danger that attends
? little knowledge? is not so much in theory
as in practice. It is the indifferent quality of
knowledge that is harmful, rather than its limi-
ted quantity. Still, when important issues de-
pend, on either skilful manipulation of things,or
on technical teaching sought �r imparted,'nc
sutor ultra crepidam is a most valuable motto to
practise. But if such a principle as that adage
affirms wc>- to be the undeviating rule of every
individual, the monotony of life, to say nothing
of the seif conscious egotism that would neces-
sarily be fostered, would become intolerable,and
in that case a great legal luminary could
never have said with truth, as others in various
walks of life might just as truly say in refe-




rence to those who follow their callings, also

August 4th, 1873* A general insight into the

have shown, may qualify us all to take; but of
course evciQroHe milst admit that keCnness,




accuracy and completeness of insight can be
gained Only by patient observance and plodding
industry in each path separately. Some branches
of scientific research have of late years been
made much more attractive and accessible
to the general public by the delivery of
popular and interesting lectures by adopts
in their special classes; for example, much
light was thrown upon, and a new impetus
given to, the study of astronomy by Mr,
Proctor in the lectures he delivered while on
his tour through the Australian colonies two or
three years ago. The Argus of last Monday
week alludes to this fact, and also mentions that
another series is about to be delivered by one
who ranks high in scientific circles, via., Or. J.
E. Taylor. This gentleman began last Monday
night to follow in the footsteps of the dis-
tinguished astronomer, but it appears he intends
to apply himself to a much wider range of
subjects than Mr. Proctor took. As his series
is to cover geology, biology, mineralogy, zoo-
logy, botany, psychology and physiology, it is
probable that he will not be so successful as he
might have expected had he but' contented him-
self by putting upon his programme one or
two subjects at the moat. It is hard even for a
good scientist to be a specialist in many things.
The formation and promotion of science societies
and associations throughout the civilised world
have during the last 30 or 40 years tended very
greatly to increase the interest and to multiply
the number of students who give themselves to
scientific research. By students 1 mean those
who seek to know something more definite than
such general knowledge I have already spoken of.
The Royal Society of Victoria,like its prototype
the British Association, and indeed like all
similar associations whose members are actuated
by the true spirit of inquiry, and who do not
insist �n the dictum which appears to have so
much weight in some quarters, viz.?that great
show is a necessary aooompanimemt of great
work?began its useful career in a very quiet
and humble way. Both societies passed success-
fully through a healthy childhood, not wholly
free, however, from certain maladies that
childhood life is usually exposed to. Both have
reached, the elder society in Old England, a
ripe and mature manhood.strongiu the streagth
of a single aim; the younger in Victoria,that age
of manly sturdiness at which, when truth lov-
ing and brave,the outlook of the future,with its
sea of problems still unsolved, offers one of the
most fascinating attractions in life. Both
societies,the oneln the old world,theother in the
mew, stand as grand buttresses of strength to the
ever expanding temple ot science,and as beacons
te guide and help those who would become true
learners at her shrine. But apart from the
search tor truth which such associations en-
courage, their usefulness to commerce is shown

in the case of the parent society by the facts?
I.?That the system of telegraphy has
bee* brought to its present service-
able conditien in which we have it, mainly
through successive experiments by its members
on electricity,and (2), that in mechanical science
the value of iron has been greatly enhanced by
exhaustive experiments, which have served to
test and to register its relative strength, and
in the case of the Victorian society; by the fact
that its accomplished president, who,for nearly
a quarter of a century guided its investigations
with so much credit to himself, and benefit to its
members, and who retired from his post full of
honors only this year, (I refer as you are all of
course aware to our distinguished astrono-
mer, Mr. Ellery,) could in his annual
addresses which were always full of
most valuable scientific lore, afford to notice
such utilitarian subjects as the profitable con-
servation ef waste products and theconsumption
of smoke in great cities. The relation between
the applied sciences and commerce is one that
is becoming more and more interwoven and
mutually dependent on each every year. The
two in their several complex ramifications form
together a gigantic equation, each side of which
is perpetually increasing and continually alter-
1 ing in the relations amongst its several terms.
The progress of scientific discovery is one that
in several directions induces a corresoonding
effect upon labor, or upon the production and
cost of material on the commercial side,and vice
? versa. That may or may not be true, perhaps
you will be disposed to say, and in either case
you may ask is it not beside the mark ? How
does it bear upon your subject, which was an-
nounced as ? Scientific Research, and its Mani-
; fold Avenues?? Well, to that question I will j
now apply himself. I have brought commerce |
into my consideration of the subject, because j
modern civilisation makes it inseparable from |'
it, just as between capital and labor there is
a continual see saw, the supply and demand
generally balancing pretty evenly. So is the
growth of commerce throughout the world a co- |
ordinate factor in the multiplying powers of the
avenues of scientific research ; given the one !|
the other mast be the necessary result. But jl
commerce itself may be divided and sub-divided |i
under numberless heads until every part of its !j
vast domain esn be arranged and brought under i
some of the multitudinous divisions of science,
and therefore I will go back to the idea I started II
with?viz., that ? everything known and
knowable? finds its legitimate place under the
name science in its widest sense, Kant says the
ultimate object of all knowledge is to give replies
to these three questions?? What can I do,? j
? What I ought to do,? and ? What may I hope
for ;? and Huxley says?? Society is not
(patient of culture as such.? It says to everything

is the use of all your learning unless yon can
tell me what I want to know ?? Let ua try then
to bring together into wrf limited area_ all
things and people concerned in these enquiries
and assertions. And with this view let us pic-
ture to ourselves a limited portion of the earth?s
surface cut out of and fenced off from the rest.
Let it be sufficiently extensive to include within
its area a condensed that area in-

sary data of everything .and principle' has

be found ranging'from the highest the
Himalaya t�/Zhe deepest part of tire great
Atlantic basin?viz., 29,002 ft and 23,250 ft res-
pectivelyja difference in level of nearly 10
miles./ Now, let us imagine that in
the centre of thd supposed area there is
erected a vast ' school, a magnificent
architectural structure, the magnitude and pro-
portions of which shall be utterly beyond the
constructive experience of the greatest architects
and shall, in adaptability, ornate beauty and ap-
pliances, surpass the wildest dreams of the most
ambitions of their class. Call it if you will ?the
gorgeous temple of knowledge,? and, taking the
classification of the sciences which I enumerated
from the Encyclopedia, conceive of this
splendid edifice as built in _ the form _of
an irregular hexagon each side of which
forms a grand facade to that part of
the building which is set apart as the special
department where a fundamental science and its
sub divisions are fostered, studied and learned.
Over each department preside the scholars who
have attained the highest degrees of proficiency
in the respective laboratoi
studies that are connected with each. The divi-
sions and sub-divisions in each department
seem endless. The intricacies of the Mel-
bourne Law Courts are in comparison
with them as a two-roomed cottage would
be to the British House of Parliament,
In them are chambers and offices where every-
thing known is Labelled, and yet there is left
ample room for further sectional multiplication.
We will suppose that in these compartments
are preserved the records connected with all
proved facts, including the data in every step
that have led up to their proof. In another
set of books in each compartment are registered
every effort, or succession of efforts, successful
or futile, every experiment simple or complex,
which has ever been made to establish a theory
or to evolVe a law. That school I call the
school of science. From each of its six
fronts {which are not of equal dimen-
sions, for you will remember I supposed
the whole to form an irregular hexagon) radiate
broad, commanding avenues leading down to the

| boundaries imagined area. In these
several avenues reside according to their
departmentalolaseifioation the various materials,
properties, forces and phenomena of nature that
have been, and that are still to be, inquired
into, and experimented upon. These avenues
are the fields of inquiry to be explored by the
? students of -science. But just as the mighty
1 and stately viewg&f the world?s great watershed
receive accessions from countless rivulets, and
again branch off into many tributaries soare thdse
avenues approached reticulated, through and j
| through intersected, at every point, and inter-
laced one With another by paths and bye-pathsi
in every possible variety and direction. These
are the paths along , Which the learners in
science, patient and observant; must plod with
unwearying industry ; the mere dabblers,/fkg
dilettanti, will never find themselves far ad-
vanced in any of these paths, and a vast num-
f her, even of the steady plodders, can have but
I little hope of ultimately gaining a permanent
place in the great temple. Let us now, as
i visitors, enter these departments and pay a
i; flying visit to some of their chambers. The
I first we come to has written on its doors
1 Mathematics.? Its rules and formula reign
ij supreme here, and every worker must have
them always ready for action. The walla are
covered with tables, calculating and mathema-
tical language generally. Here, we meet with
a dividing line, on one side of which the oham-
hers are all devoted to the science of pure
mathematics. On this side we have a group of
the sub-division of the science, and we
find the chambers &te full of busy stu
dents, who are dealing with quantity
abstractly, i.e., without relation to mat-
ter, dry figures, as we are accustomed to
call such. We see the sub-division/ labelled
arithmetic, geometry, algebra, trigonometry,
differential and integral calculus. On the other
side the line is written up Mixed Mathematics.
This is more intersiting, because it deals with
magnitude in relation to material bodies. Those
on this side of the mathematical school are so
interwoven into, and associated with, physical
considerations, and with the investigation of
matters, that it is neoessa ry that there
s free access all along the line of division,
into the next fundamental department of our
temple?viz , into that which is marked physics.
This is the most extensive of all the depart*
ments. Its hexagonal front faces a very broad
avenue indeed that is crowded both by invest!
gators and materials of research. Like the
mathematical side, it also is subdivided
into two parts ; one dealing with sub-
stances in the mass Is called the molar ; here we
Swd chamber after chamber filled with astrono-
mers. We take a bird?s eye view of all the

for enlarging the powers of vision,for calculating

division of this department, And so in the
neighboring chambers the forces and phenomena
that belong to sound and to air are presided
over by those scientists who have pried deepest
into the laws that are peculiar to them. Then
in the 2nd division of this number two depart-
ment is what is called the molecular aide. All
matter, consisting as it does of molecules, which
are the minutest quantities of elementary sub-
stances or compounds, and which are capable of
existing in separate forms, are acted upon in
different ways by light, heat and electricity.
Here we examine these affects in their diverse
operations. * Melecular attraction' is one of the
laws that reigns here,and cohesion and chemical
affinity are instances of it. Numberless other
chambers in this No. 2 compartment of physics
are devoted to geography, physical geography,
and their divisions ; to geology and all its
kindred studies, which no real student of this
branch of science can afford to be ignorant of.
Such are palaeontology, or the science of ancient
life in the earth; mineralogy,or the science which
treats of the properties of minerals ; meteero-
logy or atmospheric phenomena; zoology or the
study of natural history; botany, of which
everybody knows something ; and, indeed,
every branch relating to organic or inorganic
life, No. 3 department contains the great class
rooms and laboratories of chemistry, with all
their tools, appliances and unpleasant odors.
Here we might see, if we had time to loiter, the

There, too, are the laboratories in other
chambers, devoted to theoretical chemistry, to
practical, to agricultural, to medical, and to
many others. The laws that underlie the
whole physical departments apply to chemistry.
Biology gives the name to the next great
division of our temple. It is a compre-
hensive term for all those departments of
science that specially treat of living beings.
The great works of the specialists, In this walk
of science, which may be fomnd in the already
enormous but still erer-iuoireasing library of
this department,an i which throw the light
of patient research upon (the mysteries of
organised beings, animals, tor plants deserve
more than a passing allusion;; but time will not
us to linger nor to besstow more than a
hurried glance upon that gresat theory of-such
absorbing interest to studlents of natural
science, viz, evolution. Xtb is still in its
theoretical or tentative stage, Hacking, as it does,
the one link in the chain of its evidence, viz.,
the proof of spontaneous generation, which is
absolutely necessary to give otompletsness to the
whole, and until that link be supplied it cannot
be raised to a place amongst (the sciences. The
writer of the article under this head in the
lia Britannioa, 9th ed., vol.
s that science has no infOl
offer on the origin of life. Tlhat remains oh* of
the deep mysteries that sciience, with all her
wonderful research, has not yet been able to
unravel. Physiology is ome of J-ths great
sub-divisions in this fsmvth compartment
of the temple of science. Huxley defines
it as ? The science which trealts of the functions
of the living organism, ascertains their co-
ordination, the co-relation, im the general chain
of causes and effects, andl traces out their
dependence upen the physical states of the
organs by which these functions are exercised. ?
The subject thus covers two gjreat sub-divisions,
viz., animal and vegetable phiyeiology. These
again have numerous chamboirs fitted up with
all appliances for the study off nutrition, which
involves investigation into tlhe composition of
foods and ailments, and the modes by which
living things obtain nutrition! from them. The
blood, its circulation, oorpusxoles and mode of
nourishing the tissues and Ithe whole of the
nervous system are all here experimented npon,
and brought under law aucdj order. No. 5,
psychology occupies the fiftih division of our
lliam Hamilton?s defini
that is conver-
sant about the phenomena mf the mind, the
conscious subject, or self; or cego?ontology, or
all that is known about tbeing ; and all the
branches of metaphysics belong to it.
And sociology is the last compartment
in the great fabric I have askted you to explore,
though but very superficially,, with me to-night.

Here we are brought face to face with all these
forces and laws which regulate human society,
and govern it, in all its grades, whether in a
civilised or savage state. The ameliorrtion of
the condition of society is the tendeney of all
classifications of investigation in this depart,
ment of scientific research. And this is held to
be so, notwithstanding that Spencer, One of its
great exponents, takes a pessimistic view of ul-
timate success. His words which I allude to
are ? The study of sociology, sciientifioally carried
on, by ttaoing down primary reflects to secondary
and tertiary effects,which multiply as they dif-
terests of the future of the human race it

theology?if I may so expresss it? those parts
and phenomena and characteristics of it which
appeal for their solution to tthe human reason,
come rightly within the ranges of science. But
the most profound students tof nature agree in
telling us that there is a province, the explora-
tion of which is hopelessly beiyond the ken of
science. They recognise a powrer behind and be-
yond those things that are solutble by any known
laws. That power runs in a jplane parallel with
the fields of inquiry, but it iis one that never
intersects them at any point, .and in that plane
there is room for the exeroiwe of religious ex-
perience and faith. An eminemt living physicist
has argued that the mathematical principle of
the dissipation of energy makies it impossible to
conceive of the material universe as self exis-
tent, or self originating. Theire is no evidence
anywhere, except in living speioies, of the power
of originating life. Professor IJensays 1 Ele.

t
research we :equire is humility. Ihe
danger to avoid, when we know a little, is
to think we know all. Studied in the right
spirit, science will epea up wonders yet un-
thought of, and her patient and humble
students will have the reward that their merits
deserve, and if they yield not their faith in the
originator, upholder and controller of nature in
orderly and beneficent opera-

Mr. H. Brough Smyth moved a vote of thanks
to the Rev. Mr. Gar lick iov the able lecture he
had delivered, which, being seconded by Mr. J.
H. Abbott, was carried with acclamation.
In acknowledging the vote the reverend gen-
tleman said he had taken pains to have the lec-
ture having consulted an excellent
dictionary in order to correct tke technical terms
