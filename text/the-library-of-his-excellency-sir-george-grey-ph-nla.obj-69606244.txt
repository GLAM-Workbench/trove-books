THE POLYNESIAN LANGUAGE.
The Polynesian Language is spoken on numerous
islands of the Eastern Pacific, from New Zealand in
the South West to the Sandwich Islands in the North,
and Waihu (Easter Island) in the East.
The Polynesian Language has also extended itself over many of
the islands either now or formerly inhabited by the Papua race, and
on which originally Papuan Languages seem to have been spoken.
E. g. Polynesian Dialects are now spoken in Uea, one of the Loyalty
Islands (vide Part 11. Papuan Languages, p. 5), in Futuna, Niua, or Immer , and
in part of Fate or Sandwich Island in the New Hebrides (Part 11. p. 9), and
on Mai and other islands of the same group, situated to the North East of
Fate (vide Part 111. p. 18).
?We find that in any detached and small island there is a probability of the language
being spoken which is now the language of New Zealand, and as far as our limited
information goes, we are inclined to think that canoes full of the men of the race which
now inhabits New Zealand, as they drifted upon small islands, were powerful enough to
conquer the original inhabitants, and to establish themselves as the owners of the land.
In the case of a canoe drifting upon a large island, the wanderers were either killed, or
were lost, as a distinct race, in a few generations, though they handed down, perhaps, a
few new words, illustrating some new method of fishing, &c.; for, we find, occasionally, at
the North West point of ST. CRISTOVAL, a Maori word or two imported into alanguage
which seems indeed not wholly dissimilar in its vowel system, but yet scarcely to be
regarded as bearing any real affinity to it.??Rev. J. C. Patteson. (Part lll.?p. 18.)

GRAMMAR.
The Philological Part of Mr. Hale?s publication (No. 26 of Parts I.
and III.) contains at pp, 229?289 : A Comparative Grammar of the
Polynesian Dialects.
Pp. 229?230 give Introductory Remarks, and pp. 231?289 the Grammar of the
Polynesian Dialects, in 81 paragraphs.
This Polynesian Grammar is chiefly based on ? the translations made by the
Missionaries in seven of the principal dialects, namely the SAMOAN,
TONGAN, NEW ZEALAND, RAROTONGAN, MARGAREVAN,
TAHITIAN AND HAWAIIAN,? and also on several printed and a few
manuscript grammars, e.g.?a brief grammar of the SAMOAN by Mr. Heath,
missionary at the Navigator?s Islands,? and ? the first part of a grammar of
the TONGAN (as far as the pronouns) from Mr. Rabone at Tongatabu.?
? All that is given concerning the languages of FAKAAFO and the
PAUMOTU GROUP rests on the authority of the writer? (Mr. Hale), ?as
likewise the remarks upon the pronunciation of the various dialects.?
DICTIONARY.
The Philological Part of Mr. Hale?s publication (No. 26 of Parts I,
and III.) contains at pp. 291?339: Essay at a Lexicon of the
Polynesian Language , and atpp. 341?356: An English and Polynesian
Vocabulary.
P. 291?293 give a few preliminary remarks, and pp. 294?339 (with
double columns) the Polynesian Lexicon, with numerous manuscript additions.
Pp. 340 is blank ; p. 341 contains an introductory note ; and pp. 342?356
(with double columns) the Polynesian Vocabulary.
Besides the materials mentioned above with reference to Mr. Hale?s
Polynesian Grammar, the following manuscripts are stated to have been used
in drawing up these lexical works, viz. a vocabulary of the SAMOAN
language, from Mr. Mills of Navigator Islands, ?a vocabulary of the
NUKUHIVAN from Mr. Armstrong of Honolulu, one of the MAN-
GAREVAN dialect from M. Maigret, formerly missionary at the Gambier
Islands, and now resident at Oahu.?


11. THE RAROTONGAN LANGUAGE.
This Language is spoken in RAROTONGA, the
largest and most westerly of the Hervey Islands.
This group of islands is situated between 155� and 160� West
Long, and 19� and 22� South Lat., and consists of seven islands,
viz. Rarotonga , Atiu, Mangaia , Aitutaki, Mauhe , Mitiaro , and Manual.
According to Mr. Williams? statement, they are said to be in-
habited by 14,000 souls, of which about half belong to Rarotonga.
The RAROTONGAN Dialect of the Polynesian
Language is very near akin to that of NEW ZEALAND.
The chief difference between them is that the letters w
and h of the New Zealand tongue are dropped in the
Rarotongan.
The Rarotongan has exercised a powerful influence in modifying
many of the languages in the Pacific, from the fact of many of the
early native teachers sent by the London Missionary Society being
natives of that island.
All Rarotongan publications mentioned in this Catalogue
have been issued by Missionaries of the LONDON
MISSIONARY SOCIETY.
The oldest Rarotongan book known to us was printed at HUAHINE
(Society Islands) 1834 (No. 169).

111. THE TONGAN LANGUAGE.
This Language is spoken on the Tonga or Friendly
Islands , situated about 20� Southern Latitude, and
175� Western Longitude, and inhabited by about
18,000 souls.
The Tongan has a greater number of consonants than any other
Polynesian Dialect known to us, with the exception, of course, of the
Fiji, and perhaps the dialects of Faakafo and Yaitupu.
It shares the possession of the k with the New Zealand, Raro-
tongan, and Tongan, and of the h with the New Zealand, Tahitian,
Marquesan, and Hawaiian.
Like the Samoan, Tahitian and Marquesan dialects, it has both f
and �, instead of the New Zealand and Hawaaiian w and the Raro-
tongan v.
It agrees with the Samoan in having an I instead of the r of the
New Zealand, Rarotongan and Tahitian (which letter has quite
disappeared in the Marquesan).
In some ?though not many?cases, at the beginnings of words
only, it has retained the s of the dialects of Samoa, Faakafo, and
Vaitupu.
By way of palatalisation, it has frequently converted a t (before i)
into tsh (the/ of the Missionary orthography).
Instead of the p of the other' Polynesian dialects, the Tongan
books give generally the letter h.
All publications in the Tongan Language, mentioned in
this Catalogue, were published by WESLELAN Mis-
sionaries at Sydney 1830 (No. 197), and in the Friendly
Islands since April 1831.
TONGATABU 1831 (April No. 197 a, May No. 206 d, June and July No,
201, September and October No. 206 a, November No. 199, December No.
197b), 1832 (February Nos. 197b and 211, June No. 206e, June to November
No. 206b), 1833 (No. 198).


VAYAU 1838 (July, No. 201 a), 1842 (Nos. 203, 205, 211), 1843 (Nos. 199 a,
210, 213, 214), 1845 (Nos. 196, 212), 1847 (No. 200), 1849 (Nos. 202, 207), 1850
(No. 215), 1853 (Nos. 204, 206).
A Tongan New Testament edition was also printed in LONDON 1852 (No. 208).
With reference to the establishment of the press at Tongatabu,
and the most early publications issued from it, the following extracts
from the Journal kept on the island by the Revd. Wm. Woon, and
transmitted from ?Whaugauui, New Zealand, May 12, 1857,? will
be found interesting;
? April 4, 1831. This a memorable day. The Revd. N. Turner, a smith, and myself,
succeeded in putting up the Alhion printing press sent out hy the Wesleyan Missionary
Society for printing the Scriptures in the Friendly Islands; and every part is in good
order and ready for operation. I have also cased (or put my type in case) my type, and
I expect in a few days to print some instruction for the natives.
? April 14, 1831. Since the 4th inst. I have been busily employed in the printing office
preparing a Utile work for the instruction of the people of Tongatapu, and the adjacent
islands, and to-day I have put it to press, and intend to print 5000 copies (No. 197 a).
While working at press, the Queen paid me a visit, an interesting and intelligent woman,
and I presented her with a book, with which she was greatly delighted. Previous to the
introduction of the press, my brethren had to write everything for the natives. Several
chiefs and respectable persons called to see the press. They look with wonder and
delight on its operations, and regard it as a god! They are puzzled and confounded in
looking at the machinery, &c., and ask a variety of questions of the brethren, who know
the dialect, respecting its origin, &c. ! There is a general movement throughout the
island to witness this ? new thing.? I have been greatly amused at their curiosity, and
I shall not soon forget their observations to the brethren. Mr. Turner tells me that
thousands will learn to read from this little work!
? April 20, 1831. Busily employed in still printing off the little work (No. 197 a). To-
day a great chief from the ? Mua,? an inland settlement, visited the office, and was in
raptures to witness the productions of the press! Almost every day some stranger or
strangers call to see the printing? Kae buluji malohi, i.e., ?the great printer!? The
Friendly Islanders were expecting a missionary surgeon in our party when we arrived,
and when told the reason of his non-arrival, they said ; ? the surgeon might do good to
our bodies, but the printer will do good to our souls.? Old and young of all ranks are
now reading with delight this first book printed in these islands.
? May 6, 1831. This week I have finished and put to press 12 pages of a work as a
second book (No. 206 d). It contains portions of scripture from the Old and New Testa-
ment, and will be a very useful book?3ooo are required. The next book will be a Hymn
Book of 60 pages (No. 201), and in a short time I hope to get it completed and in
circulation among the people. The printing still continues to attract great attention, and
parties call from far and near to see the press!
? June 25, 1831. Since the 6th ultimo, I have composed the first part of the Hymn
Book (No. 201), and to-day finished working off 1500 copies designed for public and
private worship. I hope by the end of July to finish the second half sheet, and to finish
the work. It contains 64 pages 32m0. I have a book of Scripture Lessons (No. 206 a)
and a Catechism (No. 199) in prospect.
? September 21, 1831. This week I have finished, and put to press, the first half sheet
of Scripture Lessons (No. 206 a), giving an account of the Creation of the World, the Fall
of Man, Destruction of the Old World by the Flood, &c. It is to contain 32 pages. The
other 16 pages will contain Lessons from the New Testament. The natives are very
desirous to get everything from the press to increase their stock of Scripture knowledge.
? October 31, 1831. Finished printing the second part of Scripture Lessons (No. 206 a).


� November 7, 1831. Finished composing a Catechism (No. 199), and intend to print
4000 copies. This little work is much enquired for, and it is likely to he extensively
useful. It is our Conference Catechism.
? November 28, 1831. Finished printing 4000 Catechisms (No. 199) to-day?hard work
in this hot climate, and with so little help.
? December 12, 1831. Lately composed and put to press a second edition (No. 197b) of
the first book (No. 197 a). Thousands are learning to read by this useful publication!
? December 26, 1831. Finished printing 4000 copies of the first book, second edition
(No. 197b). The press-work is very fatiguing, and I can only work a few hours every
day in connection with my other duties.
? [There is an interregnum after this in consequence of the shipwreck of the Rev. W.
Cross and Mrs. Cross, and several natives. Mrs. Cross and 15 Tonguese drowned].
? February 6, 1832. Commenced printing 1000 copies of the first book (No. 197b), as a
number were lost in the last wreck. Finished composing a little work (? No. 206 c); also
four pages ? Rules of the Methodist Societies? (No. 211).
? June 20, 1832. Done but little for some time at printing for want of paper. To-day
I shall finish working-off another Scripture Lesson Book (No. 206 c), when I shall have
used all my paper.
? August 6, 1832. Composing a second edition (No. 206b) of No. 3. book (No. 206 a), to
be printed on seme foolscap paper procured?all our demy being used!
? October 20, 1832. Printing off the Scripture Lessons (No. 206b), and to day a vessel
has arrived and brought us more paper.
? November 2, 1832. Finished printing off the Scripture Lessons (No. 206b).
? I find other records of this kind in my journal up to January 1834, when I left Tonga
for New Zealand.
? In 1832 the Revd. John Williams, who was murdered at Erromanga, was with us,
and in his Missionary Enterprizes he records the following; ?
<i n m y visit to Tongatapu, I was truly delighted to find that the (Wesleyan) Mission-
aries had received a printing press, and that it vv as most actively engaged in preparing
the word of life for the people. Its invaluable operations were commenced in April 1831,
and by November 1832, twenty-nine thousand one hundred copies of small books, contain"
ing five millions seven hundred and seventy-two thousand pages had been struck off*
Such facts furnish delightful evidence of the untiring diligence of the Missionaries who
supplied the matter, and of the perseverance of Mr. Woon who had charge of the mighty
engine.??See that work.?

IV. THE SAMOAN LANGUAGE.
This language is spoken on the SAMOA or
NAVIGATOR ISLANDS, situated between 169�
and 173� West Long, and between 13� and 15�
South Lat, and consisting of eight islands, viz.,
Upolu, Savaii, Tutuila, Manua, Manono , Apolima ,
Orosenga, and Ofu.
The population of these islands was, in 1853, calculated to amount
to 33,901 souls (15,587 on Upolu, 12,444 on Savaii, 3,389 on Tutu-
ila, 1,275 on Manua, 1,015 on Manono, and 191 on Apolima), of
whom 11,736 were men, 9,844 women, 6,456 boys, and 5,865 girls.
Missionary operations were commenced by the LONDON Missionary
Society in 1830, by the location of native evangelists from the Society and
Hervey groupes, and in 1836 by the establishment of six British Missionaries,
whose number was doubled in 1853.
The number of native teachers connected with this Mission in 1853 was
190, and the number of chapels throughout the group 177 ; whilst there were
6,271 adults and children who could read.
The number of converts by the London Missionaries was then estimated at
3,259 (4,865 in 1857), and of those by the Roman Catholic Missionaries, who
had commenced a Mission on the Islands in 1845, at about 500.
The SAMOAN dialect resembles closely the TON-
GAN, from which it differs chiefly by the loss of the
letters k and h.
The k is changed in Samoan (as in the Tahitian and Hawaiian
dialects) into a sort of guttural hiatus, sometimes indicated in the
writings of the Missionaries by the mark [?]; but most generally left
unnoted.
Instead of the Tongan h (which is found also in the New Zealand,
Tahitian, Marquesan and Hawaiian dialects), the Samoan has (like
the dialect of Faakafo and Yaitupu) the sibilant s which occurs in
Tongan only at the beginning of words, and then very rarely.


A printing press was established at Leulumoenga on
Upolu, by the LONDON MISSION, in May 1839; and
from this press the greater part of the publications in the
Samoan Language was Issued. All those mentioned in
this catalogue were published by London Missionaries.
Some earlier books in the SAMOAN Language were printed at Huahine
(Society Islands) 1834?37 (Nos. 220, 221, 224, 227, 232 and 233) and at
Rarotonga 1837 (Nos. 230 and 278).
ETHNOLOGY.
Chapter 111. (pp. 34 ?112) of Capt. Erskine?s Journal, &c. 1853,
(No. 25 of Part 111. Fiji Language) refers particularly to The Samoan
Islands.

Mr. Heath was missionary in Manono and the neighbouring districts of Upolu from
1836 till his death, 9th May 1848. Once, during this period, ?he undertook the visi-
tation of the stations to the westward ; was appointed to assist in the commencement

MANUSCRIPTS.
288 a. Maps drawn by native children, pupils of the Infant School,

Map of Upolu, four copies, one page oblong Bvo each; and map of

Presented (together with some specimens of the writings of the Infant

formerly Missionary at Saluafata, Upolu.


V. LANGUAGE OF FAKAAFO AND
VAITUPU.
FAKAAFO (Bowditch Island) forms, with two other
coral islets Nukunono and Oatafu (Duke of York's and
the Duke of Clarence Islands) the Union Group, situated
five degrees due north of the Navigators? Islands, and
inhabited by perhaps 1,000 inhabitants.
VAITUPU (Tracy's Island), Nukufet.au ( Depeyster's
Island) and Funafati (Ellice's Island) are three other
coral islets (the Depeyster Islands), ten degrees west of
the Union Group.
The Language on the two islands, FAKAAFO and
VAITUPU, was found by Mr. Hale to be nearly, or
quite identical.
It is a purely Polynesian dialect, closely resembling the Samoan, from
which it chiefly differs in generally pronouncing the Jc instead of the guttural
catch of the Samoan.
In Fakaafo, the s is frequently sounded like a strongly aspirated h.
ETHNOLOGY.
An account of Fakaafo , or the Union Group is given at pp. 149
161 of Mr. Hale?s publication (No. 26 of Part I. and Part III.), and
one of Vaitupu, or the Depeyster Islands at pp. 161 ?169 of the same
book.
GRAMMAR AND VOCABULARY.
The Philological Part of Mr. Hale?s publication treats, at pp. 357
?364 of the Dialect of Faakafo and Vaitupu , giving, at pp. 358?361,
grammatical notes ? deduced from the sentences which were written
down on the spot, as heard from the natives,? and at pp. 362?364
(with double columns) a Vocabulary of about 220 words.


VI. TUB TAHITIAN LANGUAGE.
This Language is spoken by about 18,000 or
20,000 inhabitants of the SOCIETY ISLANDS.
This group is composed of two clusters, the EASTERN
(or Georgian Islands) comprising Tahiti (149� 30' West.
Long., 17� 30 South. Lat., with about 8,000 inhabitants)
and the smaller islands of Aimeo (or Moorea), Tetuaroa,
Tvpuaemanu, and Metua, and the WESTERN with
Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa, and Porapora.
The Tahitian dialect shares with the Samoan and Hawaiian the
loss of the k, with the Marquesan and Hawaiian that of the vg.
Like New Zealand, Tongan, Marquesan, and Hawaiian, it has an
h instead of the Samoan s , and with New Zealand and Rarotongan,
an r instead of the I of the Tongan, Samoan, and Hawaiian.
It possessess also, like the Tongan, Samoan, and Hawaiian, the
two consonants f and v, instead of the Rarotongan v, and the New
Zealand and Hawaiian w.
All the books in the Tahitian Language, mentioned in
this Catalogue, were published by Missionaries of the
LONDON MISSIONARY SOCIETY, and printed at
Sydney 1813 or 1814 (Nos. 294, 299, 306, 313), and in
the Society Islands since 1819.

VII. THE MAMUESAN LANGUAGE.
This language is spoken on the MARQUESAS
ISLANDS, situated between 138� and 141� West.
Long, and between 7� and 11� South. Lat.
This group of islands consists of two clusters, the SOUTH-
EASTERN, with the principal islands Hivaoa , Tahuata , and Fatuhiva ,
and the NORTH-WE STERN (or Washington Group), with Nukuhiva ,
Uahuka and Uapou.
These six habitable Marquesan Islands are said to contain about 6,000
inhabitants, viz.: Nukuhiva 1,200, Uapou 500, Llivaoa (or Dominika) 300,
Uahuku 300, Tahuaka 500, and Fatuhiva 940.
The Marquesan Dialect agrees mostly with the Tahitian,
from which it differs chiefly through the loss of the
consonants h and r.

VIII. THE HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE.
This language is spoken on the SANDWICH
ISLANDS, situated between 154� and 161� West.
Long, and 18� and 23� North. Lat.
The population of these islands, according to the census taken in
1851, was 84,165 souls (.Hawaii 25,864, Oahu 25,440, Maui 21,047
Kauai 6,956. Molokai 3,540, Niihau 714, Lanai 604).
The Hawaiian Language is that Polynesian Dialect
which, of all those we are at present acquainted with, has
the smallest number of consonants.
Like the Samoan and Tahitian it has lost the k, and like the Marquesan
and Tahitian the ng. 1
It agrees with the New Zealand Dialect in having a w instead of the/and v
of the Samoan, Tougan, Tahitian and Marquesan, and the v of the Rarotongan.
It has the I ot the Samoan and Tongan dialects instead of the r of the
New Zealand, Rarotongan and Tahitian, which is entirely dropped in the
Marquesan.
The Hawaiian pronunciation of the t seems to approach very nearly to that
ofa*; and it is on this account that the Polynesian t is represented in
Hawaiian books by the letter k.
All the publications in the Hawaiian Language, men-
tioned in this Catalogue have been issued by Missionaries
of the A. B. C F. M. (American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions), who established a Mission in the
Sandwich Islands in 1819.
A printing press was at first established at Honolulu, Oahu, before 1825, and
another at the High School Lahainaluna, Maui, 1834.
Numerous publications in the Hawaiian Language not described in this Catalogue are
mentioned in the Annual Reports of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions. b
