Dangers and Diftrefles
Which befel
Isaac Morris, &c.
N the iath of October y
1741. we put to Sea in
our Long-Boat and Cut-
ter, to the Number of
eighty, leaving Cape. Cheap and nine-
teen others on Wager Ifland., in Lat.
47, S. on the Weftern Coaft of Ameri-
ca, where we had remained about Five
Months. Our Defign was to fleer a-
long Shore, thro* the Streights of Ma -
B gcllan^


gcUan, to the Coaft of Brafil , which,
tho’ a defperatc Undertaking in fuch
a Part of the World, remarkable for
tempeftuous Winds and tumbling Seas,
we engaged in it with the utmoft
Chearfulnefs, being buoyed up with
the Hopes of once more feeing our
native Country.
In our Pail age fcveral of our Com-
panions were Ifarved to Death, and
thofe of us who furvived were fo
miferably reduced, thro’ Want of
Nourifhmenr, that we had Pearce
Strength to do our Duty. Such a Gang
of miferable Objefts could fcarcely
be met with. Fifteen only remained
who could be called tolerably healthy.
But 1 (han\ fpin out this Narrative
with a particular Detail of the Mis-
fortunes which attended us in our
Faffage thro’ the Streights , Mr, Bulks-


ley having given a full Defeription of
them in his Journal ; but fliall begin
my Account within a few Days of
our being left afhore, on the Conti»
nent, by the Crew of the Long-boat,
On January the icth; 1741-2,
after having been fourteen Days with-
out Sight of and almoft defti-
tute of ProvifionS; we were bleft
with the agreeable Profpeft; diflant
about feven Leagues. We flood in
dircftly for it; and came to an An-
chor in eight Fathom Water, At
Five next Morning we weighed; and
fleered N. E. by E. about a Mile from
the Shore ; where we faw a great
many wild Horfes and forrie Dogs o
At Noon we had a good Obfervation;
and found ourfelves in Lat. 38. 40. S.
We founded; and had but two Fa-
thom and half at High Water, a
B 3 Shoal


Shoal of Sand running out to the S. E.
four or live Leagues, which when we
got clear of we fleered N. E. into a
large fandy Bay, and anchored in three
Fathom and half.
On Tuefday Jan . t 2. our Provisi-
ons being quite done, and only one
Cask of Water remaining, we ran as
nigh in to the Shore as we could with
Safety, and fourteen of the healthieft
of us agreed to fwim afhore, in or-
der to try for Provilions. I was of
the Number, and we all landed fafe,
except one of the Marines, who was
drowned within three Fathom of the
Beach, being quite fpent, and none
of us near enough to aflift him. We
had four Casks thrown overboard af-
ter us, in order to be fill’d with frefli
Water, if we fhould be fo happy as
to find any, to which were 1 allied
fome


fomc Muskets 5 with Ammunition,
which we received. After we had
walked about a Mile in from the
Beach; we faw a great Number of
wild Horfes and Dogs : The Horfes
were of a fmall Size; but the Dogs
of a large Mongrel Breed. There
were large Flocks of Parrots about the
Rocks., and near the Water-fide a
few Seal. We likewife met with a
good Spring of frefli Water, which
rofe out of a Trench not far from the
Shore. We fliot a wild Horfe and
fome Seal, and filled three Casks with
frefli Water, which were next Morning
towed aboard by five of thofe who
fwam afliore. Soon after which the
Schooner flood farther off at the
Sea Breeze blowing ftrong.
On the 14th the Wind blew frefli
at E. S, E. and we faw our Veflcl
ftretching


ftretching farther off, and foon after
we received, in a icuttled Cask, a few
Neceflaries, with Ammunition, and
a Letter to acquaint us of the Rifque
they Ihould run in lying near the
Shore, and that they were obliged to
ftand farther off for their own Safety
'till the Weather fiiould be more fa-
vourable.
Next Morning we had the Wind
at N. N. W. with fair Weather, when
we expe&ed they would have ftretch’d
in for the Land j but, to our great
Surprize, we faw the Schooner with
her Enfign hoifted at the Topping-
lift, and under Sail from us. The
moderate Weather, with the Wind
off Shore, gave them a fair Opportu-
nity of ftanding in for us, if they
had thought fit. Why they did not
is beft known to themfelves* the
mo ft:


moft probable Rcafon we could give
for fuch inhuman Treatment was. that.,
by leffening the Number of their
Crew, they might be better accom-
modated with Room and Provifions:
Poflibly they might apprehend fome
Inhabitants might be near us* but if
fo, they could be none but Indians,
And we could not help looking on it
as the greateft Afl: of Cruelty thus to
maroon us under a falfe Pretence of
an utter Impoflibility of taking us on
board with them.
The difmal Apprehenfions we were
under at fuch an unexpe&ed Stroke
appeared plainly in our Countenan-
cesj and are much ealier to be ima-
gined than deferibed. We found
ourfelves on a wild defolate Part of
the Worlds
ftitute of Provifions. 5 T5s we
had


had Arms & Ammunition, and, whilft
that lafted, we made a tolerable Shift
for a Livelihood. The neareft inha-
bited Place we knew of was Buenos-
Ayres , about three hundred Miles to
the N. W. * but at prefent we were
in a very poor Condition to undertake
fuch an hazardous Journey, being fo
miferably reduced by our tedious Paf-
fage thro’ the Streights of Magellan,
Nothing remained but to commit our-
fclves to kind Providence, and make
the beft of our melancholy Situation,
we had recruited ourfelves.
We were in Number eight who
were thus abandoned by our
for whofe Prcfervation we riiqued
our Lives, in fwimming afliore for
Provifions. Our Names were Guy
Broadwater , Samuel Cooper , Benjamin
Smith , John Duck , Joj\ Clinch , John
Andrews ,


Andrews, John Allen, and myfelf.
After deliberating upon our unhappy
Circumftances, and comfoiting each
other with imaginary Hopes, we
came to a Refolution of taking up
our Quarters on the Beach where we
landed;, "till we fliould grow ftrong
enough to undergo the Fatigue of a
Journey l.to Buenos-Ayres. The Wea-
ther being very favourable, we took
up our Lodging in a Trench near the
Sea-fide, quite expofed, without any
Covering but the Heavens. Here we
ftay d about a Month, during which
Time we lived upon Seal., which were
very plenty, and which we knocked
down with Stones, after we had cut
off their Retreat, by getting between
them and the Sea. Here was likewife
Plenty of ftefli Water, from a fmall
Spring which rofe out of the Trench,
fo that, at the Month"s End, We had
C pretty


pretty well recover'd ourfelves, and
concluded upon laying in a Stock of
Provifions for our Journey to Buenos -
Ayres.
Having provided ourfelvcs each with
a Knapfack, which we made of Seal-
in the beft Manner we could,
we put into it as much dried Seal as
we could carry, and their Bladders
we filled with frcih Water, which fer-
ved us for Bottles. We took our
Muskets and Ammunition with us,
and, thus accoutred, we fet out on
our Journey about the Middle of Fe-
bruary * and, that we might proceed
with the more Certainty, we were de-
termined to keep clofe to the Sea-fide
ViII we fhould come to the Mouth of
the River Plate. The firft two Days
we travelled about fixty Miles, but
could meet with no frefli Water, be-
fides


fides what we brought with us* the
Country being fcorch’d with Droughty
and the Rains not yet fet in. Our
Water being near expended* we were
afraid to proceed* left we ftiould pc-
rifli for want of more j fo* after a
few Debates., we agreed to return
back to our old Quarters* and wait
till the rainy Seafon. We were two
Days and half on our Return* after
which we employ’d ourfelves in buil-
ding a Sort of Hut under a Cliff ad-
joining the Sea-fide* to fecure us from
the Inclemencies of the Weather.
Here we tarried three Months* du->
ring which Time our Food was Seals
and Armadillos* which was the only
Provifion to be met with here* except
Sea-weed* which we fometimes made
ufe of with our Meat inftead of
Bread. The Seal here differ from
thofe which I have fcen in other
C a Part$ 5


Parts, both in Size and Make. The
Males are of the Bignefs of a good
Calf; their Neck is lhaggy j their
Head and Face is fomewhat like a
Lion’s. The Females are like Lionefles
before, but their Hair is fmooth all
over like an Horfe’s, whereas the
Male is fmooth only on his hinder
Parts. From the hinder Part grow
two large Fins like Feet, and two
more out of the Brea ft, by Means
of which they can climb Rocks and
Precipices, tho' they delight chiefly
to lie afleep near the Shore. Some
are fourteen Feet long, and very
fat j but in general they are about
eight Feet: The Flefli of the young
ones is almoft as white as Lamb, and
tolerable good Eating From the
Shoulders to the Tail they grow ta-
pering like FiiTt • and when the Fe-
males give fuck to their Young they


fit upon the Fins, which grow out of
their binder Part. Their Hair is of
different Colours, looking very (leek
when they come firft out of the Sea.
The Armadillo is as big nearly as
a fmall Sucking-Hg, the Body of it
pretty long. It is inclofed in a thick
Sheik which guards all its Back, and
comes down on both Sides, meeting
under the Belly, leaving Room for
the four Legs; the Head is fmall,
with a Nofc like an Hedgehog, and
a pretty long Neck, which it thrufts
out before its Body when it walks,
but on any Danger (he draws it in
under the Shell, and thrufting in her
Feet, flic lies flock ftill like a Land
Turtle, and tho’ you kick her about
file will not move berfelf. The Shell
is jointed in the Middle of the Back,
fo that flic can turn the fore Part of
4 her


her Body which Way Hie plcafcs*
the Feet are like thofe of a Land
Turtle;, and it has ftrong Claws., with
which it digs Holes in the Ground,
and burrows in them like a Rabbet.
Its Fleffi is very good Eatings and
taftes much like a Turtle.
Nothing remarkable happen’d to us
in thefe three Months, Our
ons, fuch as they were, were not very
difficult to be procured, and we were
fupplied with Fire-wood enough from
a fmall Wood or Coppice about feven
Miles from us. We feldom failed of
bringing home fomething every Night,
and generally had a hot Supper. We
paffed our Time as chearful as poor
Fellows in our Circumftances could.
But we knew we could not take up
this Place for our fettled Abode, and
tfyerc was no Likelihood of any In-
habitants


habitants near us, nor for many Miles
round could we perceive the leaft
Traces of any ever having been there ;
and ’twas to no Purpofe to expeft the
Sight of any Veil'd off at Sea; for, it
being a deep Bay and fhoal Water, no
Ships ever put in there, unlefs forced
by Strefs of Weather, and then they
muft be wrecked. Nothing remain’d
for us but to make a fecond Attempt
for the River Plate ; for, if wc fhould
march to the Inland Country in quell
of Inhabitants, poffibly we fhould
meet with infuperable Difficulties in
finding the Way back again to what
I may call our Home ; whereas if we
kept our Courfe along the Sea-fhore
we could not err. For which Rea-
fons we refolved upon another At-
tempt by the fame Rout, and, having
laid in our Stock of Seal, Armadil-
loes, and frcfii Water, towards the
latter


latter End of May, we fet forward
once more.
Tn three Days we travelled about
feventy Miles j when, towards Night,
there came on a violent Storm, with
Kain, Thunder, and Lightning, which
continued the whole Night: We had
a plain open Country, and no Place
of Shelter could be found j we had no-
thing to cover us but a Seal-skin Jac-
ket, were half dead with Cold, and a-
fraid how our Provifions would hold
out $ for wc met with no Supplies of
any Kind by the Way. To proceed
farther was only lengthening our Jour-
ney back again, which, wc feared,
would be the Confequence at laif, e-
ven tho’ we fliould frill pulh on.
There had been the ftri&eft Harmony
and Good - nature between us 'till
•now j but now we were like to have
dif-


difagreed, even to parting. Some
were for pufliing forward, be the E-
vent what it might; and Was with
Difficulty they were perfuaded not to
divide. However, upon a Repre-
fcntation of the great Diftance wc
were as yet from the Mouth of the
River, and the Improbability of
meeting with Supplies of Frovifion by
the Way, our Debates ended, and
we jointly concluded on making the
beft of our Way back to our Hut,
having been a fecond time difappoin-
ted in our Attempt.
After being arrived to our old
Quarters, we began to confult what
Meafures to take for our Security
from the Inclemencies of the Wea-
ther, and to provide for our Subfif-
tence, ’till it ffiould pleafe God, one
Way or other, to deliver us out of
D this


this melancholy Situation. In order
to avoid Difputes about the labori-
ous Parc of getting Provifions, vve a-
greed to divide ourfelvcs into two
Parties, who were, alternately, to
provide for the Whole: Four were
appointed to fcour the Country one
Day, and the other four the next.
And we had bound ourfelves by an
Oath never to quit each other, unlefs
obliged by a fuperior Force , for tho 5
we had as yet feen no Footfteps of
Inhabitants, we could not be certain
there were none on this Part of the
Globe. We had killed fuch a Num-
ber of Seal, that they now became
very fliy of us, and had lived upon
them fo long that we were almoft
forfeited, yet there was hardly any
thing elfe to be met with. We law a
great Number of wild Dogs, but could
never come near enough to kill any *
tho’


tho' now and then we chanced to
(hoot a Puppy, which-, as it was a
Change of Diet, we thought delici-
ous Fare. We faw alfo fomc Deer,
but could contrive no Method to take
them. One Day, in our Rambles,
we met with a Litter of young Pup-
pies 3 they were but three, and fee-
nied to be about two Months old,
and had taken Shelter in a Hole of
one of the Sand-hills. We took ’em
out, and brought ’em home to our
Hut. Having difoover'd that thefe
Puppies were whelped in Holes like
thofe of Rabbits, but larger, we
went all out next Day in queft of
more-, and had the good Luck to find
three Litters, in Number thirteen*
which we carried home with us, de-
figning, if poffible, to bring them
up tame. We fed them with Broth
made of Seals, and fometimes with
D q. the


the Flcdi minced (mail * and they af-
terwards became very ferviceable to
us. Each of us had his Brace of
Dogs, which were brought up under
as much Command as an Etiglijh Spa-
niel, nor would they leave us to af-
fociate with the wild ones they of-
ten fupplicd us with Armadillos, and
once they killed us a Deer. Being
one Day hunting, we faw fome wild
Hogs, with their Young * our Dogs
purfued them, and took two of the
Young, which we laved alive * and we
fhot one of the old ones, which af-
forded us many dainty Suppers. The
young ones proved to be a Boar and
a Sow, which was very fortunate,
and we defigned to rear them for
Breeding, left we fliould be obliged
to a long Rcfidence in this defolate
Country. We brought them up very
tame, infomuch that they followed
our


our Dogs whenever we went a hun-
ting * and at Night both Dogs and
Pigs took up their Lodging with us
in our Hut,
For the prefent our Condition Tee-
med tolerable * nay, we, thought our-
felves in very comfortable Circum-
ftances : We wanted for nothings
and, if we could have confined our
Thoughts to prefent Enjoyments, our
Situation was very agreeable. But
our Views were farther, and the
Fears of what might happen frequent-
ly ftruck a Damp on our Pleafures.
Winter was now approaching * we
had the Inclemencies of the Seafon
to guard againfi, and, if poflible, a
Stock of Provifions to be laid up a-
gainft future Emergencies. But wc
could not be much before-hand with
Provifions-, having no Salt to cure
them.


ihenv* and at prefent not Sun enough
to dry them; for with Winter came
on continual Storms., with Kains, in-
fomuch that fome Days we could not
ftir out of our Hut.
s Twas now more chan (even Months
fince the Long-boat left us. Winter
came on very faff, and we were but
badly fecured from the Severity of
Weather. We refolved immedi-
ately to put our Habitation in Or-
and to fecure our Hut in the
beft Manner we could. Accordingly
it was agreed that fix fliould flay at
home next Day to prepare
and two only go out after Provifions.
The Lot fell upon myfclf and John
Duck to go abroad: All the Game
we could meet with were three Ar*
madillosj, tho’ we travelled many
Miles. Twas fo dark before we re-
turn


turned, that we defpaired of finding
our Hut, and were like to have taken
up our Lodging in the open Plain, if
our Comrades had not come out in
queft of us, and, by making a Fire,
directed us towards them. After we
had broiled our Game, and fed hear-
tily, about Twelve we went to deep.
But, about Two in the Morning, a
violent Storm, with Rain, Thunder,
and Lightning, threw down Part of the
Cliff upon us, under which we had
built our Hut, and was very near pro-
ving fatal to all of us y but, thro* Pro-
vidence, none were hurt. With Day-
light came on tolerable Weather • and
now the firft Thing we had to do was
to rebuild our Hut. We immediately
went to the Coppice where we ufed to
fetch our Fire**wood, in order to fell
fome Poles. As we had but one Hat-
chet betwixt us, one only could fell
them.


them., and the reft of us brought them
out and bundled cm. We had cut fe-
veral, and were bundling therm, when
we faw Jof. Clinch running out of the
Wood, and crying. Lord have Mercy
upon us I here s a great Tiger . We
were in the utmoft Confirmation ,
for having been frequently there be-
fore, and never once feeing any Foot-
fteps of Wild Beafts, we came with*
out our Arms, fufpe&ing no Danger
from that Quarter. We all took to
our Heels, and loon faw him running
out of the Wood in Purfuit of us.
When he was come within twenty
Yards of us, finding it impoffible to
efcape him, we all turned towards
him, clapping our Hands, and ma-
king a loud Halloo, in order to
frighten him, which had the defired
Effeft: for he immediately fat back
on his Tail, gating at us. What to


do we knew not, whether ’twas bcft
to fly., or wait for his turnings but
Fear prevailed., and we walked gent-
ly off, without his pui filing us. Next
Day we all went with our Muskets
in Chace of hurt, but could not meet
with him. We brought home our
Poles., and fitted up our Hut in the
beft Manner we could., fufticient to
guard us from the Rain.
About three Weeks when
we were hunting on the about
four Miles from home., we faw a Lion
couched on the Ground., 'Watching
his Prey., as we imagin’d, it being
clofe by a wild Cat’s Hole. We joi-
ned clofe together in a Body, with
our Muskets ready, and Joj. Clinch
fired a Ball at him at twenty Yards
Diftance, refiing his Piece on my
Shoulder, but mifs’d him: The Lion
took no Notice of the Report of the
nor ftirred from his Fofture.
E He


He charged a fecond Time., ours be-
ing kept in Readinefs in Cafe he
iliould advance towards us * he fired,
and (hot him in the Right Shoulder *
he fell on his Back, and we ran to
him, and knock'd him in the Head
with the Bones of a dead Horfe which
lay near him. We carried him to our
Hut, drefs'd his Heart and Part of
his Ribs* but ’twas very indifferent
Eating.
o
Finding ourfelvcs beginning to be
ftirrounded with Wild Beafis, and e-
very Day and Night in continual
Danger (for we now feldom went a-
broad without meeting fome Bead of
Prey* this being, I fuppofe. the Time
of Year when they take their Flaunts
towards the Sea-coaft), we determin'd
to make another Pufh for our Delive-
rance., and try our Fortune once more
in an Expedition to Buenos Ayres, In
order hereto w r e provided ourfelvcs
Shoes


Shoes and Jackets of Seal Skins, and
made ourfelves Knapfa cks of the
fame to carry our Provender. The
Weather was fet in fair, and we were
fully determined to lay in fuch a Stock
of Provisions as fiiould la ft us to the
End of our Journey, if we fhould be
a Month in performing it. To this
End we divided ourfelves into two
Parties ; four of us were to go to the
Rocks for Seal, and the other four to
hunt on the Plain. Accordingly we
fet out early in the Morning j ’twas
my Lot, with Sam, Cooper , John An-
drews y and John Ducky to go to the
Rocks. Our ufual Way in killing
Seal being with Stones or Clubs, we
never carried our Muskets with us.
We had been out all Day, and killed
three j and in the Dusk of the Eve-
ning, when we were got within a
Stone’s Gaft of our Hut, I perceiv’d
our Dogs very bufy at a ftaall Diftancc a
E 2 wag-


wagging their Tails in a very fondling
Manner. Being a-hcad of my Com-
panions, I pafled on without much
regarding it, thinking they had lighted
on a dead Colt. But when 1 came
to the Hut I was quite confounded j
the Hut was rifled., and all our Nc-
cdfaries taken away. In the utmoft
Confirmation I ran back to my Com-
whom I faw {landing where 1
had left the Dogs: Seeing me running
eagerly towards them, they cry'd out.,
lidiat's the Matter y Ifaac ? I told
them our Hut was pulfd down, and
rvery thing taken away. Ay , faid
they, and jomething worfe has happe-
ned * for yonder lie poor Guy Broad-
water and Ben. Smith murder d. ? Twas
a mod Ihocking Sight : One had his
Throat cut, and the other was ftabffd
in the Breaftj they were hardly cold,
fo we thought the Murderers could
not be far off. And we were under


no fmall Apprehenfions of (haring a
like Fate. We went to the Hue to
in (pc ft more narrowly, and found c-
very thing taken away; our Powder,
Ball., and Muskets gone, the Fire ex-
tinguifVd, and not the leaft Utenfil
left. Where to or what to do we
C 1
knew not. We durft not tmft our-
ielves another Night on this fatal Spot,
and yet were afraid to venture far-
ther. At laffc we came to a Refolu-
tion of going to the next fandy Bay,
about a Mile off, and take up our
Quarters there for that Night: But,
when there, we could find no Shelter,
not fo much as a Cliff to lie under;
fo were obliged to return to our old
Place, and pafs the Night there, hap-
pen what would. Next Morning the
Dogs which belonged to our Com-
rades flood on the Top of the Cliff
barking at us, and would not come
down, tho’ we called them by their
Names;


Names * and Was with Difficulty we
enticed them down in the Evening.
What became of Jof. Clinch and John
AUen we knew not, nor could we af-
terwards learn any Account of them :
What feem’ d moft probable to us was.,
that the Indians had carried them off)
and murder’d the other two, who poi-
fibly might make fome Refifiance., as
we had all agreed to do., in Caie w T e
ihould be attack'd but., if fo, we
might probably have expected to have
found fome or other of their Enemies
killed., as our People had Fire-Arms
with them. And it was impoffible it
could be the Refult of a Quarrel a -
mong themfelves, from the Manner
of their Death, for one was ftabb'd
and the other had his Throat cut, both
very plainly done with a Knife., an
Inftrument which none of us had the
Poffeffion of. We buried’em in the
beft Manner we could., by feraping
away


away the light Sand with our Hands
two Feet deep, and railing a Bed of
Sand over the Corpfes.
This was the moft afflicting Stroke
of any we received fince our Refi-
dence in this unhappy Country. I
won’t pretend to deferibe the Horrors
we. felt the compafllonate Reader
will paint our Diftrefs in his Imagina-
tion in ftronger Colours than can be
deferibed byWords. To fee four of
our Companions fnatched from us
fuddenly we 'knew not how, our-
felvcs deprived of our Arms and U-
tcnfils, left without Fire, or any Me-
thod of procuring it, expe&ing every
Moment to fhare their Fate, or to be
ftarved to Death, filled us with un-
fpeakable Terrors.
In this melancholy State the only
thing that remain’d to be done was im-
mediately to quit this unhappy Place,
and make one Attempt more for Buenos
Ayres ,


Ayres . We had no Time to lofe., but
initantly let about tearing up the Seal
in {mail Pieces., raw as it was, with
which we filled our Knapfacks, and
their Bladders wc filled with Water,
left we fhould find noneon our jour-
ney. Having furnifh'd ourfelves with
as much Provision as we could carry 5
we fet forward on our Journey., with
our fixccen Dogs and two Pigs; pray-
ing the Almighty to be our Guide.
Wc kept dole along the Sea
a$ we had done before., by which
Means wc could not mifs the Mouth
of the Fuver Flate ; where when we
fhould arrive our Defign was to travel
along the Side of that River till we
o
fhould come to feme inhabited Place :
A Scheme cafy enough in Imagina-
but in PracHce attended., as we
found, with infuperable Difficulties.
The Sea Coaft all along is a plain
fandy Beach ; on the Land Side are
here


here and there very high Sand-hills:
In the Valleys of thefe Hills we re-
pofed ourielves at Night. On the
Beach we fometimes found fome Coc-
kles, which the Sea had wafli’d in ;
thefe were a great Dainty to us. We
met with Part of the Wreck of a
large Ship which was drove upon the
Beach;, particularly a Man of War’s
Gang-board., and a Piece of Plank
mark’d fifteen Foot. In the Valleys
of the Sand-hills was Plenty of Wa-
ter, which had ponded up after the
Rains, and we frequently met with
dead Fifli thrown in upon the Beach;
fo that we had a Variety of raw Meat
to feed upon. We alfo found by
the Sea-fide a very large dead
which was a Feaft for our Dogs and
Pigs, and at a little Diftance a Parcel
of fine Whale-bone,
At the End of ten Days we made
the Cape of the River, having tra-
velled very hard every Day., and met
with tolerable Weather. But when
F we


we got there we found a Multitude
of final! Rivers and muddy Swamps
to obffruci: us. We Twain over feve-
ral of them, with ourKnapfacks acrofs
our Shoulders, and when Night came
on we cover'd ourfelvcs with the
R Lillies, but were almoff devour'd by
Muskitoes. Next Day we made fe-
veral Attempts to proceed farther, but
found it impofllble to accomplifh our
Journey • the farther we went the
greater Difficulties we met with. We
were fevcral times in Danger of being
fuffocatcd, the Bogs often finking us
to the vShouldcrs; fo that, after ma-
ny fruitlcfs Attempts to proceed, we
found we had no Remedy left but to
tread back the melancholy Path and
return to our old Place of Rendez-
vous j which we performed in lefs than
ten Days.
At our Return we were afraid to
ramble far abroad, having neither
Arms nor Ammunition to defend our-
felves from the Wild Beaffs. Our
two


two Pigs maintained us near a Fort-
and afterwards we were obli-
ged to live upon fome of our truliy
Dogs * but this raw Way of feedings
which continued three Months longer,
brought us into an ill State of Health.
About a Quarter of a Mile from our
Hut we found a dead Horfe, of
which now and then we took a Mor-
fcl, by Way of Change j and, could
we have got Fire to dreis it, the
Variety would have been agreeable
enough. Not with Banding our Fears,
Neceffity compelld us to go abroad
in Search of other kind of I rovi liens,
and fometiines we had the good For-
tune to bring home an Armadillo,
One Morning we found the Frunk
of a large Tree, and imagined twas
not impoffible, with the Help of the
Skins of Seal and Horfes, to make a
fort of Boat with it which might
ferve to convey us along Shore to the
River Plate . But we had no kind of
Tool to life. J. Duck recollefted that
f 2 gbou|


about eleven Months at the
End of our firft Attempt for Buenos-
Ayres, he threw away his Musket, it
being a very indifferent one., and not
worth the Trouble of bringing home.,
having enough befides for our life.
We propofed to go in Search of in,
which if we could find might ferve to
make a Hatchet. Accordingly we
furnillid ourfelves with fome raw
Seal and W went, and found the
Musket, tho" above fixty Miles. On
our Return home we found feveral
Oftriches Eggs., about half buried in
the Sand;, which was a refrelliing Meal
to us we never met with any of
the Birds). When we brought it
home we beat half the Length of the
Barrel flat with Stones., and whetted
an Edge to it againfl: a Rock., the o-
ther Half ferved for the Handle, and
it made a tolerable Hatchet.; at leaft
what would have ferved inficad of
one., if Providence had not foon after
put


put an End to our Dcdgn in the fol-
lowing Manner.
Two Days after we had finiflicd
our Hatchet., it being my Turn to
flay in the Hut, my three Comrades
went to a Place which we called the
Long Voint in Search of Provifions.
Towards Evening I walked out to fee
if they were returning j when., to my
Aftonifliment, I di(covered about a
Dozen of Horfcs galloping down the
fandy Bay towards our Hut, and., as
they came nearer, I plainly law Men
.on their Backs, & that they were In-
dians. 'Twas in vain to fly j I imagb
ned nothing but Death approaching,
and prepared to meet it with all the
Refolution I could muftcr up. I ran
towards them, and fell on my Knees,
begging my Life with all the Signs of
Humility I could make j when 1 heard
a Voice faying, Dorit be afraid , Ifaac I
we are all here . This revived me.
The Indians alighted, and whilft feme
w ere intent on examining the Hut, o-
thers


tbers flood with drawn Knives, ready
to difpatch us in cate wc made any Re-
fiftancc. When they had facisfied
their Curioficy they gave three confu-
fed Shouts, and immediately made us
get up behind them., and carried us a-
way a few Miles in from the Sca-lhore
to the S. W. where were about a Doz.
more of their Companions, with up-
wards of four hundred Horfes which
they had taken in Hunting. They
treated us with great Humanity, kil-
led a Horfe for us, kindled a Fire,
and roafled a Part of it.; which to us.,
who had been three Months eating
raw Fledij, was a moll delicious En-
tertainment. They alfo gave each of
us a Piece of an old Blanket to cover
our Nakednefs. I w T as in great Dan-
ger, it fee ms., of being left alone * for
when the Indians met with my three
Comrades, they were immediately hur-
rying them away to their Place of
Rendezvous, till, with Difficulty, they
were brought to underftand, by Signs,
that


that there was one more belonging to
them a little Way off; and then gui-
ded them to the Hut 5 where 1 had
the Happinefs of being taken Prifo-
ner with them.
Next Morning we decamped from
this Place., driving our Troop of Hor-
fes before us. We travelled nineteen
Days before we arrived to their next
Place of Rendezvous., which., I imagine.,
was about two hundred Miles from our
Hut to the S. W. in a Valley between
two very high Mountains., where was
fine Pa (hire for their Horfes, and fe-
veral final 1 Rivers of frefii but
very little Wood to be feenfor many
Miles round. In this Valley were a-
bout a Dozen Indian Huts., built with
Foies and the Skins of Horfes, inha-
bited by another Party of Indians .,
with their Wives and who
gazed very earneftly on us., as tho 1
they had never feen any White Peo-
ple before. Here we were bought
and fold four different Times for a
Pair


Pair of Spurs, a Brafs Pan, Ofinches
Feathers, and fuch like Trifles, which
was the low Price generally fee on
each of us; and fometimes wc w r ere
play'd away at Dice; fo that we
changed Maftcrs feveral Times in a
Day. In this Place we remained near
a Month, by which Time the ieveral
Parties of Indians had returned from
their Hunting, and joined us, each
Party bringing the Horfes they had
taken in hunting, and mixing them
all in the common Stock; which were
examin’d and told over by one of the
Indians who feemed to be a fort of
Captain over the reft, and they a-
mounted to the Number of fifteen
hundred and upwards, iomc of which
were no way inferior to the belt of
our European Breed.
After one Day’s grand Feafting,
we fet out in a Body for their Chief
Town, where the King, or Captain,
Jived, with fifteen hundred String of
Horfes in our Cavalcade. We were
r


four Months in performing our Jour-
ney, and, by the Method of our
travelling, I believe it mull be a thou-
fand Miles from the Sea-Coafl where
our Hut flood. In the Day-time we
travelled, and at Night repofed our-
fclves in their moveable Huts, which
fhelter’d us from the Weather. Our
conflant Food was Horfe-flefb, which
feme chofe to eat raw, and others
broiled or roafled * and, as for Drink,
we never faifd of Water * for I found
they were well acquainted with every
fmall Rivulet, of which there are
Numbers in the Rout they took, tho’
a Stranger would hardly have found
them.
At length we arrived to the End
of our Journey, the Chief Town,
where their King lives j but our Makers
who had made the la ft Pui chafe of us
were carrying us with them to their
own Home (which we learnt after-
wards was about two hundred Miles
beyond the Town where the King rc-
G fided}.


fidcd), and had can led us feme Miles *
when a Party of Horfe came after us,
and brought us back to the Capital,
the King claiming us as his Property.
This Town confifts of about 50 Huts,,
built., in a low irregular Manner, with
Foies and Holies Skins, furrounded
with Falifadocs about three Foot Dis-
tance from each other. The Inhabi-
tants, Men, Women, and Children,
were about fourfeore. We were foon
fummoned to appear before His Ma-
jefty, who received us in his Hut,
fitting on the Ground, with a Javelin
on one Side of him, and a Bow and
Arrows on the other, a loofe Mantle
round his Waift, and a fort of Turret
of Oftrichcs Feathers on his Head, and
a long Reed Pipe in his Mouth, fmoa-
king. After paying our Obeifance to
him, he began to ask us fevcral Quefti-
ons in Spamjh , of which they all can
fpeak a little, which wc foon let him
know wc underfiood a little of; en-
quired what Countrymen we were.
and


and how we came to this Country.
VVe told him we were
loft in the South in an Enghjh Man
of War, as we were going to fight
againft our Enemies the Spaniards ‘
that we were eight in Number who
were left on a delolate Part of the
Continent ’ that one Evenings on our
Return from getting Proviiion, we
found two of our Companions mur?
deredj and tw r o more carried on
the fame Spot of Ground where we
were taken., our Hut pull’d down.,and
every thing taken from us * which we
fuppofed muft be done by fome of
his Countrymen. He then called three
or four of his Men., and talked very
earneftly to them in their own Lan-
guage. But it feems they knew no-
thing of the Affair., as he told us;
tho' he was pleafed to allure us firict
Enquiry fhould be made of the other
Parties which were out at the fame
Time. For I found by him., that he
fends out feveral different Parties eve-
G 2 ry


ry Spring from every different Town
under his Government, who take dif-
ferent Routs., and fometimes join one
another accidentally on their Return.
But of this more hereafter. When
he found we were at War with the
Spaniards , he exprefs’d a great deal of
Joy, and ask’d if we were Great Men
in our Country. We told him yes.
He fa id the Spaniards were great E-
ncmies to them, had took away their
Country from them, and drove them
to the Mountains. When he had
done examining us, he ordered a
Horfe to be killed immediately, and
drefs’d for us j and lodged us in his
own Hut for that Night, till we had
one built for us, which was the next
Day. Here we ftaid eight Months,
and winter’d, during which Time we
had frequently Snow five or fix Feet
deep. Our Work was chiefly to fetch
Wood and Water, and skin all the
Horfes which they hilled j and tho'
we were their Slaves, we were trea-
ted


ted very humanely, and they would
fuffer no one to ufe us ill. There
were four Spanijh Women in the
Town, whom they had taken cap-
tive in a Skirmifli near Buenos-Ayres j
and the King told us, with a Smile,
he would give us each a Wife.
The Country where thefe Indians
redded, as indeed the whole Coaft
of Patagonia , is very fruitful in Fad*
turc, and abounds with great Plenty
of wild Hordes, and a few Black Cat-
tle, which are entirely neglcfted by
the Indians ; Horfe- fldh being pre-
ferr’dby them, for eating, before any
other Kind of Flefh, and what they
conftantly feed upon. s Tis fituated
in a very healthy Climate, and, if the
Soil was cultivated, would certainly
produce Plenty of all Kind of Grain.
They have likewide Plenty of Wcod,
tho' few or no Timber Trees, deveral
large Coppices growing all round the
Country, tho 5 near the Sea-fide we fee
nothing but a plain open dandy Coaft.
The


The Patagonian Indians y at Icalt
thofe in that Fart of the Country
where we refided, are tall and well-
being, in general, from live
to fix Feet high, good-natured and ob-
liging to one another, and never lee
each other want. Thcf they have
what they call a King, yet he feems
to be only a Chief or Captain of a
Party , for, as they have no let tied A-
bode, but live fcattered throughout
that Part of the World in little Towns
or Parties, each Party feems to have a
Chief, who prefides over them like a
Petty King. . I never could obferve
any Rules of Government among ’em *
but at a Drinking-bout King and Sub-
je&s are all alike. Their King is dif-
tinguiflfd from the reft by his being
the biggeft: Man, and by wearing a
kind of Sa(h round his Waift. lis
true he has a Deference paid him by
his Subje&s, and whatever he orders
to be done is immediately performed,
being himfelf exempted from any kind
of


of Work * but I never faw any Pu-
ni Ihm cuts infli&cd by him., nor any
.Quarrels among except
when they get at a Drinking-Feaii,
and then their Wives always took
care no ill Confequence fhould fol-
by putting every Weapon out
of their Way., and efpecially taking
care of their Knives. For which Rea-
fon I imagine that in Liquor they are
always quarrelfome. One or two In-
fiances of that Kind happen’d whilfl
we were among them. Their Method
of Feafting is this: They have in the
Summer a Plenty of fmall fwcet Berries
growing like our Whortle-berrics., and
when they have procured a fufficient
Quantity of thern, they dig a Pit in
the Ground., about four Feet
the Bottom and Sides of which they
line with Horfes Hides. This Cask (if
I may fo call it) they half fill with
thefe Berries., and then fill it up with
Water 5 which they ftir well with
Sticks., and afterwards leave it to fer-
ment


ment about forty eight Hours. They
all fit round ? fmoaking and drinking,
for a whole Night together, Women
as well as Men, finging in their Way,
but more like 111 ticking Cries : and
O J
when drunk frequently proceed to
Blows.
They feldom live long in one Placej
for when their Horfes have eat up the
Pafture in one Place, they remove
their Town and all their Goods, which
is foon done, a few Miles from the
former j and this feveral times in a
Year fo that they have no fettled
Abode. They have fcattcr’d Habita-
tions all over the Country, and but
few Huts together ’ the Town where
their Chief refides has three times the
Number of Dwellings to any of the
refl: which I law.
They feem to have fome Notion
of a Deity, and pay a fort of Wor-
fhip to the Sun and Moon j efpecially
at every New Moon, they colleft
themfelves in a Body, and make a fo-
lemn


lemn Procefiion round the T owr 3 one
going before with a kind of Hoop in
his Hand., round which arc tied little
Brafs Bells., adorn'd with Clinches
Feathers., which he would frequently
fwing round in his Hand; and then
the whole Company would make a
mod: hideous Noife., which, I fnp-
pofe., they defigned for Singing. This
Ceremony ufually lafied about Half
an Hour. This Method with their
Hoop and Bells is likewiie ufed when
any of them are fick or dying. A
white Flannel Cloth is hung up be-
fore the fick Perfon., and the Man
with his Hoops and Bells., who is ge-
nerally one of his comes
to vifit him j after a few Mi-
nutes he leaves him 3
and walks feveral times round the
Hut, jingling his and talking
aloud in a Variety of Accents, which
we could underftand nothing of, but
imagined he defigned it for Prayers
for his fick Friend. When any of
FI ’em


y cm dies., they foon bury him, gene-
rally the next Morning. They roll
up the Dead Body in a Hide, with
every Thing that belongs to him., as
Bows, Arrows, and carry it,
without any Ceremony, at fome Dif-
tancc from the Town * where, they
throw it into a large round Pit, dug
on Purpofe, which they afterwards
fill up with Earth. Yet notwithftan-
ding they have no Ceremony at their
Funeral, their Mourning for the
Dead is very ftrift, which the Friends
of the Deccafcd obferve for three
Months j during which Time they re-
move themfelves at a Difiance from
any of the reft of the Houfes, and
converfe with nobody * but are fup-
plied with Provisions from the whole
Town, by the Order, ’till the
Time of Mourning is over. They
feem to have fome Notion of the
Devil, at leaft are afraid of Appariti-
ons * for none of ’em will ftir out of
his Hut, when dark, without Compa-
ny.


ny. And one Night in particular we
heard a great Node in the Town., like
feveral Drums beatings which, next
Day, we found to be fomc of the
Indians beating the Sides of their
Houles, which were made of Horfcs
Skins, with large Sticks, in order to
frighten away the Devil.
Each Indian has but one Wife, and
they live together in a very loving
Manner. When any of ’em lye-in
there’s a Provifion made for them dif-
ferent from what they are accommo-
dated with at another Time* for the
Entrance of the Hut, which at other
Times is always open, is fliut up with
Horfes Skins as foon as the Wo-
man begins to be in Travail j and
no one goes in till fhe comes out
with the Child in her Arms, which is
prefently wrapt up in a Sheeps Skin,
and, inftead of a Bed or Cradle, is
lain on a Machine fomewhat like our
Hand-barrow, the Bottom of which
is likewife covered with a Sheep’s
H 2 Skin.


Skin. This is hung up by the four
Corners, and the Child 1 wings for-
wards and backwards, in ft cad of be-
ing rock d in a Cradle, its Arms and
Legs being fa ft cif d to this Engine by
a Lafli of Horfe-skin, to prevent its
falling over. By this Method of
Treatment, when Children, the back
Part of the Heads of all the Indians
are very flat * for they never lay them
but on their Backs. Perhaps it may
be owing to this likewife that there is
not a crooked Perfon amongft them.
In two or three Hours after they have
lain-in they go about their ufual Work.
Every Morning they take all their
Children, young and old, and carry
them to the next Brook or Rivulet
adjoining, and plunge them naked un-
der Water, even when the Ground is
covered with Snow * by which Means
they are harden'd to run about naked,
even in the Midft of Winter. The
Men wear Beads and little Bells round
their Neck, Wrift, and Small of their
Lc g s j


Legs * and the Women adorn their
long Hair with the fame. For fuch
Trifles as thefc, together with
Erafs Pans, and fuch like, they traf-
fick their Hides with the Spaniards ,
when at Peace with them.
And now their Time for making
the Hunting Voyage approaching,
which they continually do every
Spring, and generally fpend a whole
Summer in taking their wild Horfcs,
we made great Interceflion to go with
them * but were given to underhand,
that we mull be fent farther into the
Country, to remain with other Indians
Vill their Return. But at laft wc pre-
vailed, by alluring the Chief that the
Englifh had Friends at Buenos-Ayres.
who would make him very handfome
Satisfa&ion for us, and would redeem
us at any Price he fliould put upon
us. This feemed to pleafe him, and
he then confented. We were at pre-
fent about 1000 Miles from Buenos*
Ayres * and their Rout extends to the
Eaftern


Eaftcrn Coaft of Patagonia y home to
the Sea., about an hundred Miles to
the Southward of Buenos Ayres, When
they fee out, they carry with them e-
very Thing belonging to them, Wo-
men, Children, Houfcs, and all.
Thefe laft are flung acrofs the Horfes,
and at Night taken down for flicke-
ring themfelves from the Weather.
They take with them a few Horfes
more than they ride, which ferve for
maintaining them till their Hunting
begins, which fcldom happens till they
have travelled feven or eight Days.
And now the wiflfd-for Time was
come, when we all fet out in a Body,
except John Ducky w r hofe Misfortune
it was to be too near of a Complcxi'
on with thofe Indians (for he was a
MolattOy born in London) ; for which
Reafon he was fold by the Chief to
a Matter farther up in the Country ;
where, I believe, he will end his
Days, there being no Profpeft of his
ever returning to England, We had
travel I’d


travelled ten or twelve Days before
we had feen any wild Horfcs ’ but
foon after feveral Stragglers fell Vic-
tims to their Ingenuity. Their Me-
thod of taking them is really aftonifh-
ing, and worthy of a very particular
Defcription. As they are all excel-
lent Horfemen, and their Horfes as
fleet as the wild ones, Vis very feldom
they mifs, tho’ now and then an Ac-
cident of that Kind happens ; but the
Rider is look'd upon with Contempt.
They have two different Methods of
taking them., each of which I have
feen them perform with incredible
Dexterity. The firft is with a Lafh
of Horfe Skins., about two Inches
broad and fifty Feet long, with a run-
ning Noofe at one End of it. This
Noofe they hold in their Right Hand,
and the other End in the Left, till
they come within a few Yards of the
Beaft, when they throw the Noofe
over his Head, even on full Speed,
and hold the other End faft in their
Left


Left Hand. The Beaft is foon ftopt
and taken. The other Method is
with a narrow Strap of
about twelve Feet long, to each End
of which is faficned a round Ball of
Iron, about two Bounds Weight.
When within Diftanccof their Game.,
they hurl one of the Balls feveral
times round their Heady ’till they
have got the proper Swings and then
throw it at the Horfe's Legs, parting
with the Ball in their Left Hand at
the fame Time * which feldom fails
of entangling their Legs, and throw-
ing them to the Ground. ]he Hor-
fes thus taken arc fecured by fome of
the Company, whofe Bufinefs is
chiefly to tie thefe Horfes together in
a String, and guard them. In a few
Days they become very tame. They
are likewife very dextrous in killing
Birds with thefe Bails., and will throw
them to a prodigious Height in the
Air. This is what they are trained
up to from their Infancy, and are ve-


ry experc at, even in their Youth.
Thcfe Iron Balls, fatten'd in the a-
bove Manner, arc likewife their chief
warlike Weapons, next to their
Bows and Arrows.
Being now arrived within an hun-
dred Miles of Buenos Ayres , we beg-
ged of him to difpatch one of his
Men to the Governor, to acquaint
him of three Englifh Pri I oners he had
with him at iuch a Di fiance, and to
ask if he would redeem us , which
he did. And the Mcfl'engcr, on his
Return, brought him a certain Pledge
for fulfilling his Promife, which was
a Gold-laced Waiftcoat. Next Day
we were told to get ourfelves ready to
go to Buenos Ayres , and that he and
fome of his Men would go with us.
The Hopes of once more feeing
our Fellow Chrittians filled us with
Joy. We were brought immediately
before the Governor, who fatisfy’d out
Indian Prince, and paid him his Ran-
foin, which was ninety Dollars, and
I a Few


a few Trifles, and then difmifs’d him.
We returned him our hearty Thanks
for his Kindnefs towards us during our
Abode with him, in which Time we
were treated with greater Humanity
than we afterwards met with in our
long Confinement on board the Spa*
nijh Admiral Fi%arro .
After we had pafs’d Examination by
the Governor, and had given him a full
Account of our paft Misfortunes, we
were for a filort Time difmiiVd upon
Parole. And here I fhould be very
ungrateful if I did not do Juftice to
the Prefident of the Englifh Afliento
Houfe, Mr. Grey, by acknowledging
that Twas entirely owing to his Com-
paffion, and kind Interceflion with
the Governor, that we were thus re-
deemed from the Hands of the Indi-
avSy he offering to do it at his ow T n
Charge. We were fent for feveral
times before the Governor, and ear-
ncftly prefs'd to turn Catholicks, an 4

and true EngliJJjmen y and hoped to
die To. Many tempting Offers were
made to {educe us y but., thank God*
we refilled them all. When he
found all his Efforts were of no Ef-
fect, we were fent as Priloners of
War on board the Aft a , which lay
then at Monte Vecho , about thirty
Leagues down the River, waiting for
Orders, and had lain there upwards
of two Years. This was the Spa*
nifh Admiral Pisano's Ship, which,
after an unfuccefsful Attempt to pafs
Cape Horn , in order to be in the
South Seas with her Squadron before
ours, was, by tempeftuous Weather,
drove back, and obliged to put in-
to the River Flate , having loft near
half her Crew; the Admiral having
quitted her, and gone over Land to
Chili.
We were confin’d on board the
Aft a above a Year, with 16 other
Enoli/h Prifoners, in which Time we
I 2 were


were treated more like Slaves than Pri-
fbners of War. Our Bufinefs was
to do all their nafty Work , to Iwab
and clean the Decks, fore and aft., e-
very Morning j and, after the Work
was done, were confin'd between
Decks, w ith a Ccnrinel over us, as tho’
we had been Criminals, with a poor
Allowance of Victuals. In fhort, our
Ufagc was fo bad that we agreed with
the refi. of the Lnghfb Prisoners to at-
tempt our Liberty, tho' at the Rilque
of our Lives. Accordingly one Night
we cfcaped from our Guard, inten-
ding tofwim afhorc, and travel to a
Fortttguefe Settlement on the North
Side of the River, the Ship lying
within a Quarter of a Mile of the
Shore. M vie If and one more got fafe
to Land ‘ the others were difeovered
before they got into Water. I was
quite raked j the other had a Shirt
wrapped round his Head. Before we
got half-way to the Shore a Gun w r as
fir'd from the Ship to alarm the Town.
We


We travelled till Two in the Mor-
ning, and then lay down among the
Rudies. The Weather being very
fro ft y, our Feet fwelfd and full of
Thorns, we could travel no farther.
Soon after Day-light we met with
fome Men on Hoiieback, belonging
to the Plantations, to whom we fur-
rendered ourfelves ; and they took us
behind them to their Houfc. The
next Day we were carried from thence
by fome Soldiers, who were fent in
Purfuit of us, and were carried on
board the Ship ; where we were put
in the Stocks, Neck and Heels, Four
Hours every Day for a Fortnight.
At length we were inform d of the
AdmiraPs Arrival at Buenos Ayres ,
who foon after came on board, and
gave Orders for refitting the Ship in
the beft manner they could, being de-
termined to carry her to Old Spain.
But there was a great Deficiency of
Hands; for which Keafon Orders
were given to imprefs what Men they
could


could at Monte Vedio. Thefc., with
the 11 Indians whom they had Four
Months before taken Prifoners in a
Skirmifli at a Diftance from Buenos
Ayres, whom they defign’d for their
Row were fent on board *
and foon after I had the Pleafure of
feeing my Brother Mr.
who was loft in the Wager
with us., but chufing to follow the
Fortune of Capt. Cheapo arrived with
him at Chili, He came by Land from
Chili with fome Officers belonging to
the Spanifh and arrived in
March at Buenos Ayres, The latter
End of OSlober followings 1745,, we
fet fail From Monte Vedio in the Aft a,
bound for Spain,
Three Days after we failed an Af-
fair happened on board which was
like to have proved fatal to the whole
Crew* for, about Nine at Nighty
we were alarmed with the Cry of a
Mutiny * and fo indeed it proved:
But fuch a one as would never have

been fufpe&cd by any of the Ship’s
Crew., or perhaps credited by Pofte-
rity, if fuch a Number of Perfons
were not ftill living to atteft the Fa£h
But, left I fliould do Injuftice to the
Memory of fuch a furprifing Event,
I (hall beg Leave to relate it in the
Language of Mr. Walters , alluring
the Reader that I was a Witnefs to
the whole Affair.
cc Pisano had not yet complea-
ted the Series of his Adventures j
for when he and Mindinuetta came
back by Land from Chili to Buenos
Ayres, in the Year 1745, they found
at Monte Vedio the Afia, which near
three Years before they had left there*
This Ship they refolved, if polfible,
to carry to Europe 5 and with this
View they refitted her in the belt
Manner they could* But their great
Difficulty was to procure a fufficient
Number of Hands to navigate her ;
for all the remaining Sailors of the
Squadron, to be met with in the
Neigh-


Neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres , did
not amount to an hundred Men.
They endeavoured to fupply this De-
feft by prefling and putting on board
many of the Inhabitants of Buenos
Ayres, befides all the Englijh Prifo-
ners then in their Cuflody, together
with a Number of Portnguefe Smug-
lers, whom they had taken at diffe-
rent Times, and Come of the Indians
of the Country. Among thefe laft
there was a Chief and ten of his
Followers, who had been liirprized
by a Party of Spanifh Soldiers about
three Months before. The Name of
this Chief was Orellana. He belonged
to a very powerful Tribe, which had
committed great Ravages in the Neigh-
bourhood of Buenos Ayres. With
this motley Crew (all of them, ex-
cept the European Spaniards , ex-
tremely averfe to the Voyage) Fi-
fet fail from Monte Vedio , in
the River of Plate , about the Be-
ginning of November, 1745* And
-; v the


the native Spaniards y being no Stran-
gers to the Diflatisfa&ion of their
forced Men, treated both thefe, the
Englipj Pril oners, and the Indians ,
with great Infolence and Barbarity *
but more particularly the Indians :
For it was common for the meaneft
Officers in the Ship to beat them moft
cruelly, on the flighted Pretences,
and oftentimes only to exert their Su-
periority. Orellana and his Followers,
rho’ in Appearance fufficiently patient
and fubmiflive, meditated a fevere Re-
venge for all thefe Inhumanities. As
he converfed very well in Spanifh
(thefe Indians having, in Time of
Peace, a good Intercourfe with Buenos
Ayres') , he affe&cd to talk with fuch
of the Englijh as underftood that
Language, and feemed very defirous
of being informed how many English-
men there were on board, and which
they were. As he knew that the
Englijh- were as much Enemies to the
K Spa-


Spaniards as himfelf, he had doubtlefs
an Intention of difclofing his Purpofc
to them, and making them Partners
in the Scheme he had projected for
revenging his Wrongs and recovering
his Liberty. But having founded
them at a DiCtance, and not finding
them fu precipitate and vindiftive as
he expefted, he proceeded no further
with them j but refolvcd to truft a-
lone to the Refolurion of his ten
faithful Followers. Thefe, it fhould
feem, readily engaged to obferve his
D 1 reft ions, and to execute whatever
Commands he gave them. And ha-
ving agreed on the Meafures neceflary
to be taken, they firft furniihed
themfelvcs with Dutch Knives, fharp
at the Point, which being the com atop
Knives ufed in the Ship, they found
no Difficulty in procuring. Befides
this, they employed their Leifure in
fecretly cutting out Thongs from raw
Hides, of which there were great
Num-


Numbers on board, and in fixing to
each End of thefe Thongs the dou-
ble-headed Shot of the fmall Quarter-
Deck Guns. This,whenfwunground
their Heads, according to the Prac-
tice of their Country, was a moft
niifchievous Weapon, in the Life of
which the Indians about Buenos Ayres
are train’d from their Infancy , and con-
fequently are extremely expert. I htfe
Particulars being in good Forward-
nefs, the Execution of their Scheme
was perhaps precipitated by a parti-
cular Outrage committed on Orellana
himfelf. For one of the Officers, who
was a very brutal Fellow, ordered
Orellana aloft, which being what he
was incapable of performing, the Of-
ficer, under Pretence of his Difobe-
dience, beat him with fuch Violence
that he left him bleeding on the Deck,
and ftupified for feme Time with his
Bruifes and Wounds. This Ufage
undoubtedly heightened his Thirft for
K a He-


Revenge, and made him eager and im-
patient till the Means of executing it
were in his Power ’ fo that, within a
Day or two after this incident, he and
his Followers opened their defperatc
Refolves in the enfuing Manner :
cc It was about Nine in the Eve-
ning, when many of the principal
Officers were on the Quarter-Deck,
indulging in the Freffinefs of the
Night Air * the Waifi ef the bhip
was filled with live Cattle, and the
Forecaftle was manned with itscuflo-
mary Watch. Orellana and his Com-
panions, under Cover of the Night,
having prepared their Weapons, and
thrown off their Trowfcrs and the
more cumberous Part of their Drefs,
came all together on the Quarter-
Deck, and drew towards the Door
of the Great Cabin. The Boat!wain
immediately reprimanded them, and
ordered them to be gone. On this
Orellana fpokc to his Followers in his
native


native Language ; when four of them
drew off, two towards each Gang-
way, and the Chief and the fix re-
maining Indians feemed to be (lowly
quitting the Quarter-Deck. When
the detached Indians had taken Pof-
feflion of the Gangway, Orellana pla-
ced his Hands hollow to his Mouthy
and bellowed out the War-Cry ufed
by thefe Savages, which is the harfli-
eft and moll terrifying Sound known
in Nature. Th is hideous Yell w r as the
Signal for beginning the Mafiacre :
For on this they all drew their Knives,
and brandiflfid their prepared double-
headed Shot * and the fix, with their
Chief, which remained on the Quar-
ter-Deck immediately fell on the Spa-
niards, who were intermingled with
them, and laid near forty of them
at their Feet j of which about twen-
ty were killed on the Spot, and the
reft difabled. Many of the Officers,
in the Beginning of the Tumult, pufli-
cd


ed into the Great Cabin * where they
put out the Lights, and barricadoed
the Door, and of the others, who
had avoided the firft Fury of the In-
dians, lome endeavoured to efcape a-
long the Gangways into the Forecaf-
tle, but the Indians, placed there on
Purpofe, ftabbed the greateft Part of
them as they attempted to pafs by, or
forced them off the Gangways into
the Waift: Others threw themfelves
voluntarily over the Barricadoes into
the Waift, and thought themfelves
happy to lie concealed among he
Cattle : But the greateft Part efcaped
up the Main Shrowds, and flieltcred
themfelves either in Tops or Rigging.
And the’ the Indians attacked only
the Quarter-Deck, yet the Watch in
the Forecaftlc, finding their Commu-
nication cut off, and being terrified
by the Wounds of the few who, not
being kill’d on the Spot, had Strength
fuffieient-to force their Paflage along
the


the Gangways, and not knowing ci-
ther who their Enemies were, or what
were their Numbers, they likewife
gave all over for loft, and* in great
Confufion, ran up into the Rigging
of the Foremaft and Bowfprit.
cc Thus, thefe eleven Indians,
with a Refutation perhaps without
Example, pofleflcd themfelves, almoft
in an Inftant, of the Quarter-Deck of
a Ship mounting fixty fix Guns, with
a Crew of near five hundred Men,
and continued in peaceable Pofl'effion
of this Poft a confiderable Time:
For the Officers in the Great Cabin
(among whom were Pisano and Min•
dimietta ), the Crew between Decks,
and thofe who had efcaped into the
the Tops and Rigging, were only
anxious for their own Safety, and
were for a long Time incapable of
forming any Projeft for fupprelfing
the Tnfurreftion, and recovering the
Poffeflion of the Ship. It is true, the
Yells


Yells of the Indians , the Groans of
the Wounded, and the confufed Cla-
mours of the Crew, all heighten’d by
the Obfcurity of the Nighty had at
firft greatly magnify’d their Danger,
and had filled them with the imagi-
nary Terrors which Darknefs, Difor-
der, and an Ignorance of the real
Strength of an Enemy.* never fail to
produce. For as the Spaniards were
fcnfible of the DifafFc£Hon of their
preft Hands, and were alfo confcious
of their Barbarity to their Prifoners,
they imagined the Confpiracy was ge-
neral, and confider’d their own De-
finition as infallible , fo that, it is
faid, feme of them had once taken
the Refolution of leaping into the
Sea, but were prevented by their
Companions.
cc However, when the Indians had
entirely clear’d the Quarter-Deck, the
Tumult in a great mcafure fubfided *
for thofe who had efcaped w’ere kept
filent


filent by their Fears, and the Indians
were incapable of purfuing them,
to renew the Diforder, Ordlana y
when he faw himfelf Mafter of the
Quarter-Deck, broke open the Arm-
Cheft, which, on a flight Sufpicion
of Mutiny, had been ordered there a
few Days before, as to a Place of the
greateft Security. Here he took it
for granted he fliould find Cutlafles
fufficicnt for himfelf and his Com-
panions, in the life of which they
were all extremely skilful; and with
thefe, it was imagined, they purpofed
to force the Great Cabin. But on o-
pening the Cheft, there appeared no-
thing but Fire-Arms, which to them
were of no life. There were in-
deed Cutlaffcs in the Cheft, but they
were hid by the Fire-Arms being laid
over them. This was a fenfible Dif-
appointment to them; and by this
L Time


Time Pi%arro and his Companions ki
the Great Cabin were capable of con-
verging aloud., thro’ the Cabin Win-
dows and with thofe in
the Gun-Room and between Decks *
and from hence they learnt that the
Englifh (whom they principally fuf-
peded) w ere all fafe below., and had
not intermeddled in this Mutiny j
and by other Particulars they at laft
difeovered., that none were concerned
in it but Orellana and his People. On,
this and the Officers refolved
to attack them on the
before any of the Difcontented on
board fliould fo far recover their firft
Surprize as to refled on the Facility
and Certainty of Poizing the by
a Jundion with the Indians, in the
prefent Emergency. With this View
got together what Arms were
in the Cabin and diffributed them


to thofe who w T ere with him * but
there were no other Fire-Arms to be
met with but Pifiols, and for thefe
they had neither Powder nor Ball.
However, having now r fettled a Cor*
refpondenee with the Gun-Room,
they lowered down a Bucket out of
the Cabin Window, into which the
Gunner, out of one of the Gun*
Room Forts, put a Quantity of Pif*
tol Cartridges. When they , bad thus
procured Ammunition, and had loa-
ded their Piftols, they fet the Cabin
Door partly open, and fired fome
Shot among the Indians on the Quar*
ter-Deck, at firffc without Effeft , but
at laft Mindinnetta , whom w 7 e have
often mentioned, had the good For-
tune to flioot Orellana dead on the
Spot. On which his faithful Con>
panions, abandoning all Thoughts
of farther Refiftance, inftantly Ica-
L 3 ped


per! into the Sea ; where they every
Ivan perifhed. Thus was this Infur-
re fii on quelled, and the PofiTefiion of
the Qua*ter-Deck regained, after it
had been full Two Hours in the
Power of this Great and daring
Chief, and his gallant and unhappy
Countrymen.
After this all was quiet, and the
Admiral, finding that none of the
Enghjlj were engaged in this Infurrec-
tion, for a few Days treated us with
a little Humanity 3 endeavouring to
engage us, by large Fromifes of Pre-
ferment, to enter into the Spanijh
Service. But finding nothing would
work on us, we afterwards felt the
Smart of his Refentment by a fe-
vere Hlage.
Nothing remarkable happened af-
terwards, more than what commonly
happens


happens at Sea., s till we arrived at
a Harbour about Five
Leagues to the South of Cape Finif-
terre j which was the latter End of
February 2 1745-6.
We begged to be lent aflhore., as
Prifoners of War’ but were told we
mull go in the Ship to the Groyne,
Whereupon we all went in a Body
on the Quarter-Deck., and told the
Admiral., if he would not fend us a-
fliore, we would no longer be Slaves
on board. Next Day we were fent
afhorcj and confined fifteen Days in
a with an Allowance only of
Bread and Water, and chained toge-
ther as Criminals,, "till the Ship faifd
for the Groyne ’ when we were relea-
fed from our Dungeon., and guarded
to the Groyne by Land with a File of
Mufquetecrs. as foon as we
arrived^


arrived, we were put into the Guard-
houfe for two Days, from whence
wc were fent to *St, Antonio's Caftlc,
which is on an Wand at the Entrance
of the Harbour, a Prifon for Thieves
and Felons. In this difmal Place we
were kept Fourteen Weeks, among
the worft of Malefadors, ’till an
Order came from the Court of Spain
to fend us to Portugal j allowing us
a Guide, and a Real per Day.
In Eight Days we got to Oporto,
and made Application to the Englijh
Conful, who, after hearing the Hard-
fiiips we had gone through, gave us
each Three Days Maintenance and a
Quarter of a Moidorc.
On April a B. 1746, we embar-
ked on board the Charlotta Snow,
Capt. Henry Miller , bound for Lon-
don,


don, under Convoy of the York and
Folkjione Men of War, and arrived
at London on the Bth of July follow-
ing : Three only of the Eight left on
the Patagonian Coaft being fo happy
as to fee once more their native
Country viz. Samuel Cooper y John
Andrews , and Myfclf.
