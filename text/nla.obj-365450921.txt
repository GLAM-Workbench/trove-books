Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, who changes! not, abide with me.
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
Amen.
Paalm X 1033
The Lord is my shepherd: therefore can I lack nothing.
He shall feed me in a green pasture: and lead me forth beside the
waters of comfort.
He shall convert my soul: and bring me forth in the paths of
righteousness for His name’s sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff comfort
me.
Thou shall prepare a table before me against them that trouble
me: Thou hast anointed my head with oil and my cup shall be full.
But Thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
Gloria.

The Most Reverend the Archbishop of Sydney
Sfijmn
Fight the good fight with all thy might,
Christ is thy Strength, and Christ thy Right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.
Run the straight race through God’s good grace.
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His Face;
Life with its way before us lies,
Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.
Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;
His boundless mercy will provide;
Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.
Faint not nor fear. His Arms are near.
He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shall see
That Christ is all in all to thee.
Amen.
