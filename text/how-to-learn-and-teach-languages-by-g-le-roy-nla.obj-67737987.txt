HOW TO LEARN AND TEACH
.
LANGUAGES.
The learning of languages may be comprehensively classed under
two heads?the one we will term the Theoretical , and the other will
be conveniently understood as the Practical. The former part, i.e.
the Theoretical, is almost, if not exclusively, the way in which a
knowledge of the classical languages is acquired at our grammar
schools. The first rudiments are acquired with the grammar, and
these, succeeded by dictionaries,notes, and the teacher?s explanations,
carry the student on to the reading of authors in the language he
is studying. He can hardly be said, however, to have acquired a
practical knowledge of the language by this method, as, if he
should go to a country where the language thus acquired was the
spoken one, he would still have to acquire the power of using the
language in familiar intercourse.
To acquire a practical knowledge of a language it is generally
assumed that the best plan is, that the student should proceed to
the country where the language in question is the national one.
As most persons, however, when they go to a foreign country with
this object in view, fail to get on the right method of proceeding
to work, their progress is rarely satisfactory. In order to make
the distinctive character of my ?Method? clearly intelligible, I
must first briefly describe the best plan for acquiring a practical
knowledge of a language in the country where it is spoken. I shall
then endeavour to assert for my Method the claim of being
essentially identical with the practical method already described;
and, in the third place, I wish to prove that my method is a great
improvement upon the so-called Practical Plan. In a word, I
undertake to demonstrate that a language can be acquired by my
Method more satisfactorily, than if the student were, for this
purpose, to proceed to the country where it constitutes the spoken
language.


THE BEST PLAN, ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICAL METHOD, OF LEARNING
A LANGUAGE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT IS SPOKEN.
This method applies equally, in its essential features, to the
acquisition of all languages ; hut I will assume, for the purpose of
illustration, that the object of the student is the obtaining of a
practical knowledge of French. We will consider the case of an
Englishman, unaquainted with that language, proceeding to
France in order to learn French. His proper plan would be to get
hold of a Frenchman, who possessed an adequate knowledge of
English, in addition to his native tongue, and so fully qualified to
give the Englishman all requisite explanations. Suppose they
are together where French only is spoken, and that the
Englishman wishes to express in the language of the country ?
? This building is sixty feet high,? and asks his companion to
instruct him to express this in French. His French companion,
we may assume, would repeat the equivalent French sentence,
accompanied perhaps by a verbal explanation. But written
explanations are much superior to the same delivered orally;
inasmuch as the latter may soon be forgotten, while all teaching
requires frequent repetition. In this, and similar cases, what the
student requires is a written or printed repertory, to which he can
at all times resort for the solution of his difficulties. In the fore-
going example, for instance, the English sentence requires to be
written, the equivalent French must be written under to show the
words and the spelling thus, ?? Cet edifice a soixante pieds de haut.?
In a third line the French pronunciation should be exhibited thus,
O O
?? Sett-td de fiss d so-dss sangt pe-d der ho.? Moreover, pre-
liminary to all this, a table of directions is required for defining
the sounds. A fourth line is again necessary to exhibit the rules
of the language and the difference of the idioms. Where in
English we say ?? This building is sixty feet high,? the French
sa y ?? This building has sixty feet of high.? This fourth line of
literal translation gives the student a clear notion of the difference
of the idiom of the two languages, while at the same time convey-
ing a knowledge of French grammar and syntax. Suppose our
student proceeding according to this plan wishes to say in French ?
? He is hungry? ? It is cold,? 11 It is a dark night,? and so on, he is,
as in the first example, provided with four parallel lines, the last of
which gives him the French mode and peculiar form of expression,
which runs thus?? He has hunger,? ?It makes cold,? ?It makes a
night dark.? After studying for some time in this manner the
student will acquire proficiency both to read and speak the
language as well as to write it intelligently : he will know French
correctly and for practical use. Then to know a language correctly,
virtually implies that it is known grammatically, for grammar
is nothing else but the ability to speak and write correctly.


When he is able to do both he knows grammar, although in this
case he has not as yet studied any formal treatise on grammar.
The two forms of translation will have taught him grammar
practically. At the stage of his progress, when he can read
French fluently, and correctly understand any author in that
language, it will be necessary, however, in order to obtain
a deeper and clear insight into the genius of the language,
to put a good French Grammar into his hands; not an
English translation, but the French text only. From this
he will come to understand the theory, upon which the practical
rules are founded. He will there find classified and arranged, in
parts and chapters, the same rules which he has already met
scattered through the text, and which he has already learned
practically. The work he has now to do is the classification of
the knowledge he already possesses. Contrary to ordinary
experience, he will enjoy some pleasure in the task of studying
grammar, as the tedious part of the process has already been gone
through, and there is a pleasure in calling to remembrance what
has once been studied and learned. A language being essentially
practical, common sense would dictate that it ought to be taught
practically, taking nature as guide, and observing how a mother
teaches her child. The matured mind of an adult is much more
capable of comprehending explanations and rules than the bud-
ding intellect of the child. In either case, however, we must
follow nature, our great master. What has been explained above
is nature?s process.
LE ROY?S METHOD OF TEACHING LANGUAGES IS THE CORRECT REPRO-
DUCTION OF THE BEST PRACTICAL PLAN OF LEARNING IN THE
COUNTRY WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN.
Having now explained what peojfie call the Practical Method
of learning a language in the country where it is spoken,
if we open the New Method and examine it in detail, it will be
seen that it is essentially the same as the best Practical Plan in
question. In the New Method there are the four lines in parallel
order, viz.;?(a) French, (b) Pronunciation of the French, (c)
English translation, (d) Literal and Idiomatic translation of the
French. This is substantially what the student beginning in
the country where the language is spoken would require, and
this he gets in a much more convenient and accessible form in
the New Method.
The four parallel lines run through the whole of Part First of
the Method, which part contains about 30,000 French words.
After going carefully through this large number of words, and
acquiring the correct meanings, the student can now dispense
with the fourth line of literal translation, and so it is not included
in the remainder of the course. Part Second also contains 30,000


French words, with the parallel lines as before, but omitting the
fourth. After mastering Parts First and Second, the reading,
according to the method of these 60,000 words, will have secured
the French pronunciation. In Part Third, therefore, the pronun-
ciation is omitted. This part also contains 30,000 words, and
includes only the text and the English translation. So then the
three parts into which the New Method is divided embrace in all
90,000 French words. Of course this is a much greater number
than is included in the whole French dictionary. This, like the
leading European languages, contains from 25,000 to 30,000
words. For the ordinary purposes of life, business, or even
literature, a much smaller number is sufficient.
Shakespeare, whose vocabulary is the fullest of all winters, finds
13.000 words enough to express the wondrous versatility of his
fertile brain. The vocabulary of Milton includes 10,000, and
that of Sir Walter Scott 8000 words. We may assume, then, that
10.000 of the usual words are sufficient for our purpose. This is
the number contained in the New Method, so that in the course
of reading 90,000 words there must necessarily be frequent repe-
titions of the same words, and that is just what is desirable and
requisite in order to fix the words with their meanings in the
memory. I think it must now be apparent that the New
Method is a reproduction of the Practical Plan above described.
LE ROY?S METHOD IS SUPERIOR, FOR ACQUIRING PRONUNCIATION, TO
LEARNING IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN.
In acquiring new words and new sounds there is this radical
difference between a child and an adult, that the vocal organs of
the child are more pliant and plastic than in the case of a grown-
up person. For this reason, what is readily impressed on the
flexible organs of the very young does not become the possession
of the more mature, without the aid of the eye, as well as of the
ear. In the case of the latter, when words and sounds are given
orally, the sounds and words require to be frequently repeated
before the power of correct utterance is acquired. All this
entails much loss of time, besides that many of the sounds will be
got imperfectly. An adult then must have the pronunciation
written in order to obtain it satisfactorily, Should he go to
France to learn, everyone will pronounce to him the sounds, but
he will meet with no one who can render these sounds correctly
in writing.
Hitherto there has been no book in which all the French
sounds are properly explained and expressed for English students
of that language. The New Method claims the merit of having,
for the first time, succeeded in setting forth correctly and properly
the French sounds for the use of English people. The Directions


for Pronunciation at the beginning of the book are so simple and
clear, that any person of ordinary intelligence and fair memory
can master them in about an hour, so as to read correctly the line
of pronunciation which, immediately under the text, forms one of
the parallel lines running through the whole of Parts First and
Second of the New Method. So, by the learning of a few simple
directions at the commencement, and reading the pronunciation
line, the student will have had practice in reading correctly some
60,000 French words. Suppose he even went to France, he
would find no such facilities either for pronouncing, or understand-
ing the language.
LE ROY?S METHOD IS REMARKABLE FOR THE SHORTNESS IN WHICH THE
ELEMENTS OF THE LANGUAGE ARE ACQUIRED, AS COMPARED WITH
OTHER TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS, OR GOING TO THE COUNTRY WHERE
IT IS SPOKEN.
There is an immense saving of time and labour gained by
getting a copy of the New Method, as it would take eighteen
months to write out all the explanations it contains that would
otherwise be required in acquiring the elements. Say that, as I have
already shown, 10,000 words is about the number to be acquired
in order to know a language. By the system in vogue in the
schools and classes, the student is left to grope for himself in
grammars and dictionaries. It is not too much to say that at the
outset the student with the New Method in his hands has a clear
start of our schools? pupils of at least eighteen months. I assume
that, although the language contains from 25,000 to 30,000 words,
about 10,000 of the words in ordinary use put a man well
up in any language, because the majority of the remaining words
are either obsolete, of rare occurrence, or are compound words;
and with the latter class, which make up more than a half of most
languages, when we know the component parts or simple words,
we, in most cases, readily come to understand their various com-
binations in compound words.
Taking, then, 10,000 as the requisite number to be acquired,
how is this result to be obtained by the old system 1 ? We may
safely say, that in turning over dictionaries, grammars, &c., five
or six minutes, on an average, are expended on the acquisition of
every word. This gives 60,000 minutes, or 1000 hours. There
is an old saying that a thing is forgotten seven times before it is
completely known. If this maxim can be accepted (and, in a
great measure at least, it is conformable with expexience), then
Jhe 1000 hours require to be doubled more than once to arrive at
the true measure of the ordinary expenditure of time under the
old-fashioned system.
In the New Method there are 600 pages; each page contains
only eight lines of text, or sixteen lines in two pages. Let the


student learn two pages a day, which is a very moderate task, and
he will have gone through the whole in 300 days, or in a year of
ordinary working days. It is neither recommended, nor is it
necessary that he should commit the text to memory; but allowing
two hours daily for this study, he will be able within that time to
make himself completely master of the text as regards the mean-
ings of the words separately, the pronunciation of each word, and
the sense and translation into English of the French text,
A child at the age of about two years begins the study of its
mother?s tongue, and, after two years of easy application is, at
the age of four, a fluent master of articulate speech. It is there-
fore quite consistent with reason, observation, and experience
that an adult, studying two hours daily according to the best
system, should do in one year what the child does in two, i.e.,
acquire a language, and with a more copious vocabulary than could
be acquired in tender childhood. This fact has been established
in Melbourne during the last year in the class, that was opened for
testing the New System.
LE ROY?S METHOD SECURES TO THE STUDENT THE HIGHEST AND PUREST
STYLE OF FRENCH.
The author of this system has a right to claim as one of the
highest merits of his work, that its text is that of the justly
renowned ?Gil Bias,? by Le Sage. This celebrated French classic,
who died a little more than a century ago, flourished during the
Augustine age of French literature?the period of the Regency.
For purity and elegance of style he is admirable; and for collo-
quial ease and naturalness is unsurpassed. The ultimate goal of
literary ambition would be attained, when the literary merits of
Le Sage?s style would be rivalled. His language is equally
adapted for the pulpit, the bar, the platform, familiar conversation
and every-day business life. ?Few,? says Sir Walter Scott in his
biographical notice of Le Sage, ?have ever read this charming
book (?Gil Bias?) without remembering, as one of the most
delightful occupations of their life, the time which they first em-
ployed in the perusal; and there are few also, who do not occa-
sionally turn back to its pages with all the vivacity, which attends
the recollection of early love.? In another place the same author
adds, ?All is easy and good-humoured, gay, light, and lively;
even the cavern of the robbers is illuminated with a ray of that
wit with which Le Sage enlightens his whole narrative. It is a
work, which renders the reader pleased with himself and with
mankind, where faults are placed before him in the light of follies *
rather than of vices, and where misfortunes are so interwoven
with the ludicrous, that we laugh in the very act of sympathising
with them. All is rendered diverting, both the crimes and the


retributions which follow them.? What an advantage, then, it
must be to the student to have begun and to carry on to completion
his studies with a text, which will be equally delightful and in-
structive to take up again in all subsequent years 1
PETTY OBJECTIONS OF A FEW TEACHERS REFUTED.
What would be regarded by most large-minded persons as one
of the peculiar merits of ? Gil Bias,? has furnished ground for ob-
jections on the part of a few. An attempt has been made to
?disparage the merits of the New Method, on the ground that the
text presents a true picture of society. These wiseacres would
shut out all real knowledge of life and society, and send their
pupils out into a world of which they had acquired but a false
?and erroneous conception. The same objections would lie against
not only the greater part of the most interesting and instructive
works of literature, but even against Holy Scripture itself, many
separate passages of which polite ears would regard as most
indelicate. Such persons, to be consistent, must taboo all our
newspapers, which put forth all their efforts to chronicle the daily
record of all the rascality of our criminal classes. But in reality
?these objectors chiefly consist of those who have a personal motive,
when criticising the system here advocated. These are the
numerous band of French teachers, who feel apprehensive, that
their trade is being interfered with. Many of these teachers are
themselves sadly wanting in their French pronunciation, and they
see the danger of a system coming into use, by which their pupils
would soon detect the weaknesses of the masters, since in a very
short time the pupils would know and be able to judge, with the
New Method in their hands, what was correct pronunciation.
Parents, when they came to know the merits of this system,
would demand its adoption, a change that might very seriously
affect the profit and convenience of some of our teachers.
Another objection is to the words in the title ? Without a
Master,? and herein, it is asserted, the author is inconsistent,
because, while publishing his work under such a title, he is himself
organising public classes in which he is engaged in teaching the
language. This objection requires very little argument for its
refutation. We still maintain that any person of mature mind,
intelligent, and of a studious disposition, can satisfactorily accom-
plish all that has been here claimed for the system, ?that he or she
can learn French correctly without a master. But then there is
another class whose wants have to be considered, and that too by
far the more numerous class?the children of our schools. It
would argue a lamentable ignorance of human nature to suppose,
that children could be trusted by themselves to pursue continuously
any study inquiring application; for them classes must be provided,


and teachers who will initiate them into their work, and who will
rigidly superintend, and kindly aid, and encourage them in their
progress. There is another class for whom it is most desirable
that evening classes should be formed, ?that is, young men
and ladies engaged in business during the day, and who, from the
heavy demands made upon their time and energies, are generally
less fitted to cope with the labours of a new study; for these a
short course in class until they get a fair start cannot fail to prove
beneficial. There are also many grown-up persons, who, from
defective education in youth, or because their minds have got out
of training, from long disuse of mental cultivation, if disposed to
begin this study will derive great benefit at the outset, by placing
themselves at first under the guidance of a judicious instructor.
COMPARATIVE MERITS OF VOLTAIRE?S ?CHARLES XII.? AND LE SAGE?S
? GIL BLAS ? FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
No one capable of appreciating the brilliant literature of France
can doubt, that Voltaire is entitled to be placed in the very front
rank of the great writers of that country. At the same time I
must point out that the University of Melbourne committed a
mistake in confining the French studies of aspirants to University
honours to ? Charles XII.? As a medium of instruction it is
defective in more than one point; the subject matter is confined
to narrow limits, the instruction is equally limited, and the amuse-
ment proper it contains insufficient. To youth the character of'
Charles, even with his superhuman energy, soon becomes mono-
tonous. The hero seldom opens his mouth, and when he does his
language is not of a character to interest the reader much. Even
the interest of battles, victories, marches, countermarches, after a
time lose their charm. Descriptions of battles and the whole
narrative of the campaigns have so much sameness that there is
necessarily a continual repetition of the same words and forms of
expression, so that the student is confined to a limited range of
words, ideas, and instruction. Of the variety, richness, and
plastic adaptability of the language in giving clear and lively ex-
pression to every thought and action, such a work can give but
limited and partial examples.
In all these requisites for a mastery of French it is impossible
to name any work superior, or even equal to ?Gil Bias.?
EXPENSE, TROUBLE, &c., AVOIDED BY THE ADOPTION OF LE ROY?S.
METHOD.
Seeing, then, that a method has been worked out in this city, and
satisfactorily proved on trial to answer the object it professes to
accomplish, it surely is the duty of those, who have the
ship of the youth of this country, to give every consideration to-


the examination of a system by which everything can be accom-
plished here, that is frequently sought to he obtained by a protracted
and expensive residence in Europe. Other things being equal, it
is surely preferable that a youth should, as far as possible, get his
education under the eye and care of his guardians, than that he
should incur the risk of Continental intercourse, before his habits
are foi?med and his moral character confirmed.
HINTS AND DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHING THE NEW METHOD,
Having explained, I trust fully and satisfactorily, my Method,
I shall now proceed to give a few practical directions about the
teaching of it. Let the teacher first of all get his pupils to com-
prehend the directions at the beginning, where the nature of each
sound is practically exhibited. He must familiarise their ears to
the pronunciation of each sound, by making them pronounce each
repeatedly. Let him then see that they fully comprehend the
signs or marks that indicate the sounds. The next step is to
make them read correctly the line of pronunciation running parallel
with the text. This being done, the teacher should, for another
lesson, give a few pages of the Method to learn. The amount
given out must, as in all teaching, depend very much upon the
pupil?s capacity, and the time at his disposal. It is not at all
necessary that these pages should be learnt by heart, but that the
meaning, spelling, and pronunciation of the text be acquired.
This should be got up in such a manner that, when the pupils come
to class, the Method being shut, and the teacher reading each
sentence, at first very distinctly and slowly, the pupils can follow
him by ear as each sentence is read, and be able to repeat and
translate, and give the meaning and spelling of each word.
By learning in this manner each lesson carefully, they not only
acquire a practical knowledge of reading and translating from
French to English, but during the course the lessons will in a
great measure partake of the nature of a conversation between
pupils and teacher.
Suppose we limit the lessons to an average of two pages a day,
this will give twelve pages a week ; and as the Method contains
600 pages, the whole course at this very moderate pace can be gone
over in fifty weeks, or a year, including two weeks for holidays.
By this time they are masters of many thousand French words,
not simply their meanings independently, but also in their various
combinations and syntactical arrangement in sentences. In short,
the student can now take up any French text, and enjoy the
exquisite satisfaction of feeling that he can follow the author
intelligently. At this stage in their progress, what will be wanting
to give a finish to the preceding course, will be the study of a
French Grammar, ?I mean a grammar entirely in the French


language; as has been already stated, though in their progress
through the Method, they have acquired a practical knowledge of
the grammar, yet it is highly desirable that they should now fully
comprehend the 'principles upon which all the rules depend. The
knowledge already acquired now requires to be classified and
methodised. In addition to this, they should be recommended to
read good French authors, as often and as much as they can.
These should, if possible, be read aloud, in order to accustom the
ear to the pronunciation.
TESTIMONIALS.
Fitzroy, February , 1875.
Mr. G. Le Roy.
Dear Sir, ?I have much pleasure in testifying that I joined
your class twelve months ago, entirely ignorant of the French
language, and within that time I have acquired such a
knowledge of that language, as I was wholly unprepared to
believe it possible to attain in so short a time. When I think of
the length of time it has taken friends of mine to arrive at the
same stage, I am really astonished at the progress I have made,
and greatly gratified at the time and expense I have saved.
My business engagements prevented me from doing justice to
your system of imparting French, but even with this drawback I
find I can take up any French book and read and translate with
tolerable ease.
To learn French by your system is less a task than a plea-
surable amusement. I consider your plan of having four lines in
Part First, three in Part Second, and only two in Part Third,
completely meets the wants of the student, and renders all use of
dictionaries and grammars unnecessary for the completion of this
part of the course. After reading through the New Method in
the manner in which you conduct your class, I believe the
student could, with advantage, follow out your plan of studying
a French grammar in that language only, and so obtain a
theoretical, as well as a practical, knowledge of the language.
I am confident that if your system were generally known and
understood among the public, and especially among our teachers,
its adoption would become general, which would be a great
benefit to all students of the language and literature of that
brilliant people, the French.
I am, Dear Sir, yours faithfully,
E. A. ARCHIBALD.


8 Capel Street, West Melbourne, 17 th February, 1875.
Mr. Le Roy,
Dear Sir, ?I willingly bear testimony to tlie excellence of your
Method of Teaching French, both as regards the pronunciation and
the ability to translate freely. For twelve months, during the
intervals of business, and amidst other pursuits, I have followed
your system, and with such advantage that X can lead Fiench
with but little assistance from a dictionary. The process of learn-
ing was simple and attractive, the pronunciation and the meaning
unfolding themselves at the same time to the eye, and becoming
easily graven on the memory. From personal observation of
your other pupils, I am satisfied that after having gone through
a good French grammar they will be able to speak the French
language with correctness and fluency.
With the best wishes for the extension of your Method,
I remain, yours respectfully,
E. L. O?CORNELL.
Hotham, Jfth March, 1875.
Monsieur Le Roy.
Dear Sir, ?It affords me great pleasure to testify to the in-
valuable assistance derived by me from your volume on the
French language, as well as the care with which you have im-
parted instruction to me in that language while under your
tuition.
Yours truly,
CHRISTINA PEACOCK.
Hotham, J+th March, 1875.
Monsieur Le Roy.
Dear Sir, ?Your volume on the French language has afforded
me great assistance in my endeavours to master that language. I
now take this opportunity to testify my approval of it, as well as
to the interest you have shown in my tuition in French.
Yours truly,
SUSANNA HALLOWS.
Melbourne, 24-th February, 1875.
In giving my testimony in favour of Mr. Le Roy?s Method of
Teaching French, I will begin by a short account of his manner of
conducting a class. The weekly work is generally about ten to
fifteen pages of the Method. This is expected to be got up
thoroughly, as regards meaning of words, spelling, and pronuncia-
tion. To test this, the teacher makes the class close their books,


and then himself reads sentence by sentence of the lesson, which
they are expected by turns to repeat after him, and spell, and
give the meaning of the words. In this manner the lesson, as
much as possible, partakes of a practical and conversational style
between pupils and master. The work which forms the text is a
masterpiece of French litex*ature, being no other than the cele-
brated romance of Le Sage?s, ? Gil Bias,? very much in style and
manner like Goldsmith?s ? Vicar of Wakefield.?
In a very short time the pupils, in an easy and interesting
manner, soon become possessed of a great number of French
words, so as to be able to read any ordinary book in that,
language.
I consider the publication of Mr. Le Roy?s New Method a
public benefit.
P. J. CLANCY.
Melbourne, 22nd February , 1875.
I consider the great superiority of Mr. Le Roy?s system is tho
facility with which the text is mastered, by his plan of having
one line under another so executed that the pronunciation, mean-
ing, and all requisite information are conveyed to the pupil at
once.
His plan is ingenious and novel, and a great saving of time
and money to the learner. I shall be greatly gratified to hear of
his Method receiving the public encouragement it merits, and
which is calculated to effect a revolution in the system of teaching-
modern languages.
J. RUSH.
Melbourne, 20th February , 1875.
Mr. Le Roy?s Method of Teaching French has, I think, manjr
advantages to the learner not found in other systems, so far as I
know.
The way in which the pronunciation of French is imparted is.
very simple, and at the same time quite efficient. In fact, a great
deal of time and money is saved by this system. A great stock
of French words is soon acquired without the trouble of diction-
aries or grammars.
FLEMING MALLINSON.
Melbourne, 20th February , 1875.
Le Roy?s mode of acquiring a good knowledge of French has a
great deal to recommend it to those who contemplate the study of
that language. The Method is easy and interesting, A gx?eat


many French words are soon acquired, and at the same time their
pronunciation and spelling. The separate study of French
grammar is deferred until the student is able to do this with the
French text, which he will be able to do in a year, as by that
time, with this Method, French can be read fluently.
H. G. DeGRUCHY.
Melbourne, 30th January , 1875 .
M. Le Roy.
Dear Sir, ?I have great pleasure in testifying to the advantage
of your system of learning French over the other methods with
which I am acquainted, the reading and pronunciation so as to
be clearly understood by Frenchmen being rapidly acquired, as
well as the correct translation of what you read.
I am, yours very truly,
DAYID CARSON.

-A- W ? Xt# V/ 1 ?
Dear Sir, ?Having for the space of sixteen months studied the
French language by your Method, I have great pleasure in
testifying to its efficiency, I have during that period made much
more progress with it, than on a previous occasion under the
system usually adopted in schools.
I remain, yours very truly,
MARIA JANE WILSON.
174 Bridge Road, Richmond, 25ik February , 1875.
X have been a pupil of Mr. Le Roy for the last twelve months,
and feel much pleasure in saying that I have made very good
progress during that period.
His Method is simple and agreeable, and much less tedious than
any other. _

Mr. Le Roy has worked out a system of teaching French which
is easy and cheap, and at the same time imparts a sound and
correct knowledge of the language.
A person of average intelligence and application might master
French by this method in about twelve months, at a cost of
about �5.

Melbourne, 22nd February , 1875.
By Le Boy?s Method of Teaching Languages, students are saved
the trouble of writing exercises. All the material for their work
is in the page before them, so that there is no interruption to the
learning. The French words, their spelling, the pronunciation,
the corresponding English sense of the passages, and also the
difference of the idioms of the French and English languages, are
all acquired simultaneously. By this means the work of learning is
rapid and interesting at the same time.

Collingwood, 18th February , 1875.
I certify that when I began French I did not know one word
of it. Now I can read and give a very good translation, after
fourteen months attending Mr. Le Boy?s class.
PETEB M'GBEGOB.
G. Le Boy, Esq.
Sir, ?I have much pleasure in expressing my highest approval
of your system of teaching the French language. So far as my
knowledge extends, I have no hesitation in saying that the system
you adopt is a distinct improvement on those commonly in use.
That your pupils in the course of one year can read fluently and
with accurate pronunciation such works as ? Charles XII.? ad
aperturam libri, is the best testimonial to the value of your mode
of instruction.
I wish you every success in your work, and I have no doubt
your teaching will commend itself to wide-spread approval.
JAMES GBOUNDWATEB, Minister,
Bector of the High School of Melbourne.


OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.
From the ?Express,? 14th May, 1873.
A work of remarkable merit has recently issued from the
colonial press, and although the subject has been treated so often,
and in such a variety of ways, the book before us possesses
excellences of so peculiar a kind, that it deserves more than a
passing notice. ?An Easy Method to Learn French without a
Master,? by M. Le Roy, published by Evans Brothers, of Collins-
street, is truly what it professes to be?an easy means of
acquiring the French language without the aid of a master. To
those who have toiled for years in the vain endeavour to master
its idioms and pronunciation, achieving no better result than that
immortalised by Chaucer ?
French as they speak at Stratford at y Bow,
The French of Paris they did never know?
to these it will seem an impossibility that with half an hour?s
careful study of the general instructions given, they can, by
means of this book, read French and pronounce it accurately.
Has thei'e indeed been found, it may be asked, a royal road to
learning! We do not mean to imply that anything in M.
Le Roy?s book will obviate the necessity for labour and attention;
but it does undoubtedly supply a means for acquiring a correct
pronunciation of the French language?such as did not, at least
for English people, previously exist. How often do we hear the
statement, ?I can read French, but cannot speak it!? We
venture to say that any intelligent person, who can read
French, may, with the aid of M. Le Roy?s book, learn to
speak as well as to read French. The method propounded in
this book appears to be the most complete and perfect ever
introduced to English readers. We certainly never thought that
French pronunciation could be taught literally in less than an
hour, and yet, by strict attention to the few easy rules which M.
Le Roy lays down, and by making one?s self thoroughly intimate
with the directions he gives, there is not the slightest difficulty in
the matter. Let any one take the trouble, first of all, to learn
the directions, and then to read two or three pages of the book in
accordance with them, and he will be surprised at the progress he
has made, as we can testify from a case which has come under
our own knowledge. Although the system can scarcely he under-
stood without examining the book, we shall endeavour here to give


a description of it. The work operated on under this new system
is Le Sage?s ?Gil Bias;? and the Hamiltonian system has been in
some sense applied to it, hut with this material difference, in ad-
dition to the literal translation placed underneath the French
words there is an idiomatic English translation; but the peculiar
characteristic for which M. Le Boy deserves so much praise is his
method of imparting to English readers an accurate pronunciation
of the French words. Everyone who has tried to acquire the
French pronunciation by means of books is aware that the English
vowels do not at all represent the sounds of the French vowels,
and hence every attempt to represent the one by means of the
other has been a failure. M. Le Boy hit upon the expedient of
combining with our English vowels a consonant which modifies
the sound of the vowel, and then by giving to our English vowel
such modified sound while suppressing the sound of the consonant,
he has made a truly marvellous approach to representing to English
eyes and ears the true pronunciation of the French words. If
this description at all conveys to our readers an idea of the merits
of M. Le Boy?s innovation, it will be easily understood that in com-
bination with the Hamiltonian system it imparts both a correct
pronunciation and a knowledge of the words. What more can
students desire 1 and we recommend them to try the experiment
for themselves.
From the ?Argus,? 22nd March, 1873.
?An Easy Method to Learn French without a Master? is the title
of a Avork received from the author, Mr. G. Le Boy. He claims
that his system of instruction will enable any student to get the
correct French pronunciation in a very short time, as in a very
brief space the rules he lays down can be thoroughly mastered.
There is no doubt but that Mr. Le Boy?s book will be very
valuable to adults anxious to obtain an insight into the French
language.
From the ? Leader,? 29th March, 1874.
Many books professing to impart a knowledge of French with-
out the aid of a master have been offered to the public, but we
have never met with one so well fitted to accomplish the object,
and so admirable in all respects, as the volume which has been
published by M. Le Boy. He calls it An Easy Method, and if it
can ever be said to be an easy work to learn a language, the title
is fahdy merited. M. Le Boy?s method has more than one object
in view. The first is to teach the pure French, and for that pur-
pose the acknowledged best novel in the French language, the


?celebrated ? Gil Bias,? by Le Sage, tbe style of which is very
suitable, has been selected for the text. The second object is to
teach quickly, and for this purpose the plan of interlinear transla-
tion is adopted, but in a novel form, the verbatim translation
being given, and also the grammatical. The time which, by the
old system, would be spent by the student in referring to the
dictionary for the meaning of the words is thus saved, as the
explanations are at once placed before him of all the words
required in the ordinary circumstances of life. Besides giving
the meaning, the verbatim translation has the advantage of show-
ing at a glance the difference between the French and English in
regard to structure, syntax, and idiom, and thus also spares the
student the necessity of learning the grammar, or rather he learns
it practically as he reads the words in sentences and acquires
their meaning. In addition to the original text and the gram-
matical and verbatim translations, there is given, likewise inter-
linearly, the correct pronunciation of every word. The main
difficulty in learning French is the pronunciation, and this
difficulty is easily overcome by the system of phonetic signs
which M. Le Boy has adopted, and by the clear directions which
he gives for using them. The third object is to teach without
the assistance of a master; and seeing the sort of key which has
been provided for opening up the mysteries of the pronunciation,
we think this object may be accomplished. The fourth object is
to teach in an amusing and instructive manner; and this also
may be deemed to be accomplishable, considering that in reading
the French text selected the student will be amused while he
learns. In short, M. Le Roy?s book is the very thing wanted.
From the ? Daily Telegraph,? Ist April, and ? Weekly Times,?
sth April, 1873.
Mr. G. Le Roy has published a large volume to give effect to
his system of teaching French without a master. It consists of
Le Sage?s famous work ? Gil Bias,? the French text of which is
given, together with a double interlinear translation, the one
showing the correct English rendering, and the other the verbatim
transcription of the words. The difference in the idiom of the
two languages is thus made apparent at a glance. The intention
is that a reader should become familiar with the language first,
and go to the grammar for its theory and classification afterwards?
i.e., that the student should learn French as in the course of
nature a child acquires the mother tongue. Mr. Le Roy?s trans-
lation is an excellent one, and the book, we have no doubt, will be
found a great convenience. Evans Bros., 44 Collins-street west,
are the publishers.


From the Collingwood ?Advertiser,? 22nd May, 1873.
Independent of its value as an educational work, Le Roy?s
? Easy Method to Learn French without a Master? is one of the
most creditable books yet produced in this colony. It is an
expensive work, however, and we trust the author and publishers
(Evans Brothers) will be amply recouped for their outlay. Mr.
Le Roy has hit upon a happy method of enabling students to
acquire a thorough acquaintance with the French language, and
the manner in which his work is arranged simplifies the process of
self-instruction to such an extent as to justify his system being
called an ?easy? one. He aspires, likewise, to teach the purest
idiom ; and, with this object, he has selected for his text Le Sage?s
? Gil Bias,? written in correct and elegant style. He also seeks
to diminish the time spent in learning, by printing, in separate
lines, the original text, its pronunciation and grammatical and
verbatim translations, so that the student is well grounded as he
progresses, and the knowledge he thus obtains of the language is
not of a superficial kind. Another object the author has in view
is to convey the instruction in an agreeable and amusing manner
?observing, in his preface, ? Any science is difficult to learn if
taught in a dry and uninteresting way; on the contraxy, it is.
easily acquired if taught by a pleasant and instructive system.
This induced the author to eliminate anything tedious or weari-
some ; therefore he has combined instruction with amusement:
' L
the French text is most attractive for the beauty of the language,
the interest and moral instrixction of the tale, and the comical
adventures which now and then occur to impart life and fun to
the study; some, in fact, so comical, that perhaps a few austere
persons might object to them as being too smart and not modest
enough. This little drawback had to be submitted to, that the
student might have the benefit of the best language.? We can
safely prophesy that the work xxnder notice will become a standard
one, not only here but in the old country ; and, with the view of
giving our readers an idea of its general design, we make room for
another extract from the preface : ?? Up to the present time,
there being no good method to be obtained and followed, the
student requiring a guide was obliged to resort to teachers, who
are rather expensive, especially if well known and good teachers ;
therefore many persons of modest income, unable to obtain an able
master or a good book, were obliged to give up the idea of learn-
ing; this induced the author to arrange a system showing at
a glance all necessaxy information, so that the guidance of a
master could be dispensed with. The only difficulty is the key
to the pronunciation, to impart which he has given a practical set
of rules / fully and clearly explained. The key, grounded on
positive principles, always the same, without exception, throughout


the system, when once known, pilots the student effectively,
without doubt or uncertainty. These principles being thoroughly
explained at the commencement of the work, any one can master
them without assistance : they may require one or two hours?
study, but if explained by a person conversant with them, a few
minutes will be sufficient. Having conquered this difficulty, the
other parts are so clear that they may be comprehended without
any other guide than the book itself, which saves much expense,
and confers a boon on those who cannot afford costly instructors.?
From the ? Age,? 29th March, 1873.
M. G. Le Roy, a gentleman whose experience in French tuition
appears to have served him well in the present instance, has issued
through the publishing house of Evans Brothers, Collins-street
west, a work which professes to be An Easy Method of Teaching the
French Language without a Master. The system adopted is very
different from that of Ollendorf, whose work has generally been
accepted as a standard one ; butj from a necessarily hasty examina-
tion of its contents, it appears to be well adapted for the want
it is intended to supply.
From the ? Economist,? 21st March, 1873.
The extreme difficulty of attaining the correct pronunciation of
any language by simply translating it into English under the
supervision of a master is acknowledged to be very great, and to
Englishmen it is more difficult to learn to pronounce French than
either German or Italian. This is due chiefly to the fact that the
same signs are used in both languages, and that the same sign
often represents two or more sounds in each, according to its
position or some other accident. This difficulty M. Le Roy has
overcome by the use of a system of phonetics, and some of his
expedients are very ingenious. For instance, to take a familiar
example, the word ?bon," good, is almost always pronounced by
Englishmen ?bong,? but a Parisian retains the nasal sound and
suppresses the ?g.? It is therefore represented with a sign de-
noting this over it. The French ?j? he represents by ?dj ? with
the ?d? suppressed. The aim of the author throughout the work
is simplicity and the convenience of the learner. Having invented
signs which represent the same sound in both languages, the
author has reduced the text of ?Gil Bias,? Le Sage?s well-known
novel, to his system, and underlined the original text with it.
Thus, any one with a correct ear, and by taking a little trouble,
may acquire a correct pronunciation more easily than by any
other method we have yet heard of. The text is also accompanied


by a free and literal translation, which teaches also the meaning
of the words. We wish M. Le Roy all success with his work, for
it is certainly much needed, and we hope it will put an end to much
of the ?ong-bonging,? as our old master used to call it, that goes
on at present, and will produce a few Englishmen who will not
pronounce ?eu? like ?oo? in English.
From the ? Herald,? Ist April, 1873.
We have received a copy of Mr. G. Le Roy?s ?Easy Method to
Learn French without a Master.? It is a handsomely got up
volume, and the method may be described as an improvement on
the usual interlineary system, the work selected being ?Gil Bias.?
In the first part each line of the text is accompanied by three
explicative lines, one for pronunciation, one for just translation,
and one for verbatim translation. In the second part there are
two explanative lines?pronunciation and good translation; and
in the third there is only one line, namely good translation. We
can strongly recommend Mr. Le Roy?s work?to be procured at
Evans Brothers??to all students of the French language.
From the ?Ararat Advertiser,? Bth April, 1873.
Messrs. Evans Brothers have just published a book by G. Le
Roy, entitled ?An Easy Method to Learn French without a
Master.? Mr. Le Roy?s plan is an excellent one. He selects the
novel ? Gil Bias,? and in the first part of the work gives the
French, its pronunciation, the literal translation, and what the
calls the good translation, that is to say, the English words gram-
matically placed. In this way the student is able to get at the
meaning of the words and the idiom, and to learn French practi-
cally, although unacquainted with the rules of grammar; in fact,
he is taught to read and speak it before understanding the rudi-
ments. The plan is one that is abundantly sufficient for all prac-
tical purposes. We have not seen a more useful book or one
likely to be more successful in attaining the object for which it has
been published. We strongly recommend the work to any one
desirous of learning French quickly and without much trouble.
