ORDER of SERVICE
HYMN
My God, my Father, let me rest
In the calm sun-glow of Thy face,
Until Thy love in me express’d
Draws others to Thy throne of grace.
O Jesu, Master, let me hold
Such secret fellowship with Thee,
That others, careless once and cold,
Won to my Lord and theirs may be.
Eternal Spirit, heavenly Dove,
The light of life to me impart,
Till fire descending from above
Burns on and on from heart to heart.
O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Still, still may love to love respond;
And teach me, when I love Thee most,
Depths all unfathom’d lie beyond.
SENTENCES
PSALM XC.
Lord, thou hast been our refuge: from one generation to another.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world
were made: thou art God from everlasting, and world without end.
Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou sayest, Come again, ye
children of men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday: seeing that is past
as a watch in the night.
As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep: and fade away
suddenly like the grass.
In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut
down, dried up, and withered.
For we consume away in thy displeasure: and are afraid at thy wrathful
indignation.
Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee: and our secret sins in the light of
thy countenance.
For when thou art angry all our days are gone: we bring our years to an
end, as it were a tale that is told.
The days of our age are three-score years and ten; and though men be so
strong that they come to four-score years: yet is their strength then but labour
and sorrow; so soon passeth it away, and we are gone.


But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man
feareth, so is thy displeasure.
So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be gracious unto thy servants.
O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon: so shall we rejoice and be glad
all the days of our life.
Comfort us again now after the time that thou hast plagued us: and for
the years wherein we have suffered adversity.
Shew thy servants thy work: and their children thy glory.
And the glorious Majesty of the Lord our God be upon us: prosper thou
the work of our hands upon us, O prosper thou our handy-work.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end.
Amen.

ADDRESS
The Most Reverend The Archbishop of Sydney.
HYMN
The sands of time are sinking;
The dawn of Heaven breaks;
The summer morn I’ve sighed for,
The fair, sweet morn awakes.
Dark, dark hath been the midnight,
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
O Christ! He is the Fountain,
The deep, sweet well of love;
The streams on earth I’ve tasted
More deep I’ll drink above;
There, to an ocean fulness,
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
O, I am my Beloved’s,
And my Beloved’s mine;
He brings a poor vile sinner
Into His house of wine.
I stand upon His merit;
I know no other stand,
Not e’en where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
The bride eyes not her garment,
But her dear bridegroom’s face;
I will not gaze at glory,
But'on my King of grace, —
Not at the crown He giveth,
But on His pierced Hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel’s land.
With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove,
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustred by His love;
I’ll bless the hand that guided,
I’ll bless the heart that planned,
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.
I shall sleep sound in Jesus,
Fill’d with His likeness rise
To live and to adore Him,
To see Him with these eyes.
The King of Kings in Zion
My presence doth command,
With Him, where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel’s land.


PRAYERS
ORGAN —"Hallelujah Chorus” (Handel)
RECESSIONAL HYMN
Ten thousand times ten thousand,
In sparkling raiment bright,
The armies of the ransom’d saints
Throng up the steeps of light:
Tis finish’d, all is finish’d,
Their fight with death and sin:
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in.
What rush of Hallelujahs
Fills all the earth and sky;
What ringing of a thousand harps
Bespeaks the triumph nigh!
Oh day, for which creation
And all its tribes were made;
Oh joy, for all its former woes
A thousand-fold repaid!
Oh then what raptured greetings
On Canaan’s happy shore,
What knitting sever’d friendships up
Where partings are no more!
Then eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimm’d with tears of late;
Orphans no longer fatherless,
Nor widows desolate.
Bring near Thy great salvation,
Thou Lamb for sinners slain,
Fill up the roll of Thine elect,
Then take Thy power and reign:
Appear, Desire of nations,
Thine exiles long for home;
Show in the heavens Thy promised sign:
Thou Prince and Saviour, come. Amen.
