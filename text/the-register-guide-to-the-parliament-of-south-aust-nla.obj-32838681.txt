■Ross, Sir Robert Dalrymple, K.B, J.P., Speaker (Gumeracha). —
Born in Island of St. Vincent 1828. His family, loth on the paternal
and maternal sides, have for more than 250 years taken an active part
in promoting settlement in North American and West Indian colonies.
His father, John Pemberton Ross, a barrister, inherited plantations in
Antigua, St. Kitts, and St Vincent, and married the only daughter of
Dr. Alexander Anderson, a well-known naturalist and botanist of the last
century—a contemporary and friend of Sir Joseph Banks. On the maternal
side Sir Robert is a direct descendant of Sir William Alexander, the first
Earl of Stirling, a Scottish poet and statesman, who received many sub-
stantial marks of Royal favour from King James and his successors. In
1621 Sir William Alexander obtained a grant of the territory of Nova
Scotia, With the view of enabling him to raise funds for the settlement
of the country he was authorised to divide the lands into 100 portions, and
to dispose of these aßng with the title of Baronet for the stipulated price
of £2OO each. He acquired another source of revenue by having granted to
him the privilege of issuing base copper coins denominated turners.
In 1631 he was finally created Earl of Stirling, Viscount Canada, and Lord
Alexander of Tullibody. In 1635 he obtained from the Council of New
England an extensive grant of land, including what was then called
Stirling, and afterwards Long Island, and he is to be considered as the
founder of that settlement which produced the State of New York. The
Earldom of Stirling has been dormant since the death of the fifth Earl.

Court of Scotland. Sir Robert Ross came to South Australia 1862 ; retired
