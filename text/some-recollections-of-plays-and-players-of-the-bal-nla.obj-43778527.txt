SOME RECOLLECTIONS OF
PLAYS AND FLAYERS
Of the BALLARAT STAGE,
IN THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES.
By an OLD PLAYGOER.
Dear Friend, —You were asking me
to write down some of my recollec-
tions of the Drama on Ballarat
during my fifty years residence here.
If I complied with your request to
the extent I should like to :’.o, I am
afraid you would say, “What, will
the line stretch out (ill crack of
doom !” and cry, ‘'Hold ! enough !’’
But I will not go hack to my first
play on Ballarat, which was to see
Brooke as Othello at (he old, though
then new, Montezuma Theatre in the
Main Hoad. There were then two
other theatres open at the same
time, the Charlie Napier and the
Victoria ; that was in 1855. But I
will commence with the Old Theatre
Royal, Sturt Street, which was built
and opened in 1858. It opened on
Boxing Night, and was managed by
William Hoskins for a Company, till
he took it himself, and during his
management he produced many of
Shakespeare’s Plays, it not so well
mounted, perhaps, as Barry Sulli-
van’s were in Melbourne, the prin-
cipal male characters were certainly
better acted than they were by Sul-
livan’s Company, rash as “Autoly-
cus” make think me to make such a
statement. Take, for instance, the
first production of Hamlet, with
Henry Neil Warner as Hamlet, the
best I lamlet we ever had here, ex-
cept ing, of cousse, the great inspired
Montgomery—at least “Aulolycus”
says he was inspired, does he not —
Hoskins as the Ghost, surely better
than that Stick Bob Heir, Rogers as
Polonius, quite as good as Lambert
in any part, and then at his zenith ;
Stuart O’Brien as Laertes ; John
Dunn as the Gravedigger ; Rian as
Horatio ; Mrs. 11. J. Ray as the
Queen, and that charming young act-
ress, Rosa Dunn, a 'delightful Ophe-
lia, her first season as a leading act-
ress. I think Mrs. Lewis, as she is
now, 1 believe, must retain pleasant
recollections of that season, when
she had such a fine company to sup-
port her. Another fine revival was
Shakespeare’s “Measure for Mea-
sure,” which was got up with en-
tirely new scenery and dresses.
Warner as the Duke, a part in which
his magnificent voice and fine elocu-
tion made a great impression. Hos-
kins could not be surpassed in his Old
Sadlers Wells part of Lucio ; Con
Ward as Angelo ; Leslie and Escalus
Bruton as Pompey ; John Dunn as
Elbow the Constable, and Lawrence
as Claudio ; Julia Harland as Isa-
bella ; Rosa Dunn as Juliet made a


great impression, especially in the
last scene at the City (tale. After
that we had a well got up and finely
acted revival of the “Comedy of
Errors,’’ with Warner and Chapman
as the two Antipholus. J. W. Bru-
ton, a splendid comedian, as Dromio
of Syracuse, and T. S. Bcllair made
quite a feature of the old conjurer,
Doctor Pinch, and Julia Harland was
Adriana. Then we had “Romeo and
Juliet,” with Warner the best Romeo
ever seen in Australia, and also the
best Alcrcutio in Hoskins ever seen
here. How light, buoyant, and brim-
ming over with animal spirits he
was : how he seemed to enjoy life.
O’Brien, Tyball ; Rogers, Capulet ;
John Dunn, Peter ; and what a
charming Juliet Rosa Dunn was.
Perhaps she wanted more strength to
let herself go in the Potion Scene,
as Miss Tittell Prune docs as well as
Rosa ; and Mrs. T. S. Bellair as the
Nurse, the best old woman we ever
had on Ballarat. Another fine old
comedy Hoskins produced was Mrs.
Inchbald’s “Every One has his
Fault,” with Warner as Captain
Irwin ; Hoskins, as Sir Robert
Ramble ; Resile, Mr. Harmony ; C.
Ward, Lord Norland ; John Dunn,
Solus ; Bruton, Mr. Placid ; Rosa
Dunn, .Airs. Irwin ; Mrs. Chapman,
Aliss Woburn, Airs. T. S. Bellair, Aliss
Spenstcr. It was very finely acted,
and much enjoyed. Then we had the
"Hunchback,” with Warner as Alas-
ter Walter Stuart O’Brien as Clif-
ford ; Hoskins, Modus ; John Dunn,
Fathom ; Rosa Dunn as Julia ; and
Julia Harland as Helen. What bet-
ter acting coul'd you want. Of
course, in the‘interim of these re-
rivals we had a variety of other
plays and after-pieces. I am only
mentioning the principals. Anqthcr
line play was Tom Taylor’s “Retri-
bution, or a Husband’s Vengeance,’’
in which Warner made a great im-
pression as Count Prinli. Hoskins as
I)e Rauprc ; O’Rricn as his brother,
and Rogers as Morrisset was re-
markably line in the husband who
transmits messages to his wife's
lover by means of his shirt studs,
and indescribably humorous ; what
a tine actor he was.
About that time we also had visits
from (t. V. Urooke, who played
“Louis (he eleventh” very finely,
and was to have played lago to
Warner’s Othello, but they had to
drop the curtain on him. However,
Hoskins took up the part, and gave
a good rendering of it, for no one
know his Shakespeare better than
Hoskins, and with Rosa Dunn’s Des-
demona, Mrs. Charles Poole as Emc-
lia we could not complain. Brooke
made some amends the next night
as Master Walter ; Warner, Clifford;
Hoskins, Modus ; John Dunn,
Tat horn ; Mrs. Charles Poole. Julia,
Rosa Dunn, Helen, the finest east
ever seen in the “Hunchback” in
Australia. Next we had the “Serious
Family. Brooke, Murphy Maguire ;
Warner, Charles Torrens ; Dunn,
Amiradab Sleek ; Mrs. Charles
Poole, Mrs. Ormsby Delmaine ; Rosa
Dunn as Mrs. Charles Torrens
What could possibly be better than
plays so acted by such actors and
actresses We also had very fine re-
vivals of the “Tempest,” with Hos-
kins as Prospero Bruton as Trin-
culo ; Bob Heir a very moderate


Culiban ; Mrs. Robt. Heir, Miranda ;
ami Julia Harland as Ariel ; and the
“Winter’s Tale,” which would have
been a great success but for the total
failure of Bob Heir's Leontcs, which
he vilely acted.
Our finest Shakespearian revival
was “Julius Caesar,” which was
splendidly got up and acted. War-
ner’s Brutus was very fine, and so
was Hojsk.in’s Marc Antony ; it was
his best serious part in Shakespeare,
for he excelled most in comedy ; Mc-
Kean Buchanan was very good in
Cassius, his powerful though some-
what rugged style of acting suiting
the part. The revival gave much
pleasure to lovers of Shakespeare.
Hoskins revived many other fine
plays, and altogether his management
would compare favorably with most
of the Melbourne managements The
following is a list of both Hoskin’s
and Sullivan’s Companies Hoskin’s
—Henry Neil Warner, William Hos-
kins, Stuart O’Brien, (t. W. Rogers,
John Dunn, Leslie, James Milne, T.
S. Beliair, H. J. Ray, Maxwell
Brown, Hope and Shute, Nugent the
Dancer, and Russell, Rosa Dunn,
Julia ,Harland, Mrs. H. J. Ray, Mrs.
T. S. Beliair, Mrs. Russell, Miss
Melville, and Miss Josephine the
Dancer. Sullivan’s—Barry Sullivan,
Robert Heir, Fitzgerald, Ireland,
Lambert, Charles Young, J. R. Gre-
ville, Harwood, Gladstone, Ford,
Mrs. Robert Heir, Rosa Dunn, Mrs.
Alfred Philips, Tilly Karle.

“Once more into the breach, dear
friend, once more,” as Henry the
Fifth says, but I thought I had done
with Montgomery, but as I see by
Boyet that he was inspired, and I
suppose he shortly will be canonised,
I must say a few more words about
him, but I will send you back the
first part of Boyet’s article ; read
it again, and say if you ever saw
such uha'dulteratad extravagant lau-
dation as to the “0 my prophetic
soul, my uncle.” I contend that
every Hamlet worthy of the name
has given the same rendering of that
passage, varied, of course by their
different methods of acting. An'd as
to “Autolycus” saying Montgomery
played John Mildmay IGO nights run-
ning, I deny it in tofo. “Still
Waters Run Deep” was first played
by Alfred Wigan at the Olympic in
the Strand, London, somewhere
about 18(10. It had a gcod run, and
Wigan played it for years about the
country. Now I took the “Era,”
the actors’ newspaper, from Mullen,
who had Maxwell Brown’s old shop
in Lydiard Street, Ballarat, from the
early sixtys till seventy. During
that period would be the time he
played the part for a few, nights now
and again, as he did in his provincial
engagements. Montgomery’s John
Mildmays was a very able piece of
acting, nobody will deny that, but
the play has never since its first pro-
duction had any but short runs, as
some favorite actors played the part.
It was a favorite piece, often played
on Ballarat under Hoskin’s manage-
ment, with Warner as John Mildmav;
Stuart O’Brien, Hawksley ; Leslie,
Mr. Potter ; Rosa Dunn as charm-
ing Mrs. Mildmay ; Mrs. J. W. Ray,
Mrs. Hector Stern old ; and J. W.
Bruton. Dunbilk Bruton was one of


the best low comedians ever seen on
Ballarat. His Jaque Strop in Rol>-
ert Macaire ; 8.8. in the Benicia
Boy ; Gabriel Pummypot in “Fraud
and its Victims,” and, above all, his
Gormandising, Always Hungry, Jus-
tice Greedy‘in a “New Way to Pay
Old Debts,” will always be remem-
bered by those who saw them. His
Justice Greedy with Leslie’s Marrall
was always his best part with War-
ner’s Sir Giles Ovcreach, one of his
very best parts. Who that saw it
will ever forget his splendid but not
inspired acting in the last act, when
brought to bay he rushes or, his
foes, and, stricken with illness, he
falls on one knee and cries, “Ah ! I
am feeble ; some undone widow sits
on my arm, and my sword, glued to
its scabbard with wronged orphan’s
tears, cannot be drawn.” It was
the last part Warner played on Bal-
larat. I was there to see it on his
farewell night. His .John Mildmay
was also one of his best parts. How
well I remember him in the scene
when Hawksley fries to bully him.
He (Warner) says its a hale Lanca-
shire lad against a battered London
roue, fresh air and exercise against
smoke and speculation.
« « «
In regard to Brooke’s Othello being
also inspired ; well, when Brooke
came here first his Othello was, and
continued for some time to be, the
best ever seen here, but as time
went on his voice decayed ; he got
heavy and lethargic in the part, at
least I thought so, and so did that
“Great and Good Man,” as “Mary
Ann,” the humorous correspondent
of the “Star” used to call Joseph
Henry Dunne. Tie wrote a very
able article on his Othello, compar-
ing it with what it had been. ITis
opinion I quite coincided with, for I
was a great admirer of Brooke.
For some time before Brooke went
home Warner was the best Othello
of the two, and Brooke knew it, for
when they played together in Mel-
bourne, Ballarat, and at the big
rush at Lamplough, Brooke alw'ays
played lago ; and does not “Auto-
lyeus” say, that when some admirer
asked Brooke just before he went
home when we should see Othello
again, he (Brooke) pul his hand on
Warner’s shoulder, saying, “Othello !
you ’will always have Othello while
you have Warner with you.” For
Brooke was a man, with all his
faults, and had no petty jealousies,
like the great Barry Sullivan or the
inspired Montgomery. I agree with
“Autocylus” in his estimate of
Starch’s acting, hut he deserves
credit for being the only actor who
ever played Shakespeare’s Richard
the Third in this country from the
text of Shakespeare, but it will never
be as popular as the altered version
of Colley Cibber, though infinitely
superior to it. I saw Stark at the
old Montezuma in the Main Road as
Holla in Pizzaro, and Charles Dr
Moor in the Robbers in the Fifty’s,
and in the Sixtys as Damon in
Damon and Pythias. Joseph Rayncr,
whom I knew in London, and who
was many years in Sydney, where he
died, was an excellent Pythias, much
better than the Damon of Stark. You
must remember Rayner as leading
actor at the Royal under Sitnmonds’


management. Rayncr played The
Ghost hero to Montgomery’s Ham-
let ; he was a good Ha.nlet as well.

Comments on ‘‘Aut.lycus.”
In the first place I think the ;.-Ti-
des by “Aulolycus” arc very read-
able, and give a good idea of what
fine artists we had the privilege ol
seeing in those days. There is too
much gush over certain favorites of
his, especially the “inspired” Mont-
gomery, which, to those who saw
him play, looks rather ridiculous. Of
course, in spite of his means of in-
formation, which should prevent it,
he makes some mistakes, particularly
in regard to Frank Hussey, who could
not dance a step, and hardly sing a
note, but was a capital negro actor ;
Holly was the dancer. Kelley was
the best all-round man we ever had
in Ballarat. With regard to Grc-
ville, he says he first saw him in a
mining eamp in 1859 ; now (ireville
was low comedian at the Charlie
Napier in 185fi and 1857. I won’t
mention other mistakes, for they are
of no importance. He might have
said more of Brooke, who did not
leave the colonies till late in 1861,
and who, the Melbourne sapient
critics said, would make, on his re-
appearance in Kngland, the greatest
sensation that had been known for
years. 1 was asked at the time what
1 thought of those statements, and
said, that he would be a complete
failure. So he was, for the manager
of Drury Lane lost £I,BOO by his
first engagement on his return there.
The reason was, the public taste had
altered, and Brooke’s voics was gone,
his pow’ers generally decayed by dis-
sipation. But these sapient critics
never seemed to see the 'difference
that time had made, together with
dissipation in his grand powers, but
“Oh the pity of it, lago, the pity of
it.” They also sent high-flown ac-
counts of Ireland home, who never
was anything more than a useful
stock actor. At home he was a per-
fect frost, as 1 said he would be,
because the public, from what was
said about him, expected too much.
He does not mention McKean Buch-
anon, who, if if he was a bit of a
Boanerges, together with some dis-
agreeable ways, was a very powerful
actor. His Cassius, in Hoskin’s fine
revival of Julius Caesar, was one of
the best things in the play. It was
got up with new Homan dresses and
new Roman scenery, and what a
caste—Warner, Brutus ; Buchanor,,
Cassius ; Hoskins, Marc Antony ;
Bellair, Julius Caesar ; Warde,
Casca ; Lawrence, Octavius Caesar ;
Julia Harland, Lucius ; Leslie, the
Soothsayer ; Mrs. Ray, Portia. It
was infinitely superior to Barry
Sullivan’s production of the same
play. “Autolycus” also treats War-
ner with neglect, although he says he
was one of his favorites. Warner
first appeared at the opening of the
old Theatre Royal as Charles Sur-
face, in the School for Scandal, and
for a long time, young as he was,
held his own as leading tragedian, in
spite of (he strong opposition against
him of Brooke and Ooppin, with their
strong company at the Olympic.


When Sullivan came Warner sup-
ported him, and made him look
“small beer” in any of the plays that
gave him opportunity. Of course
Sullivan would not naturally have
him in his own company ; Warner
was too good a man to be engaged
second to Brooke, and after he went
home he was shunted by Sullivan.
Other Melbourne engagements were
intermittent while he was here until
1864, when he left for home. They
seldom played tragedy, so his Mel-
bourne engagements were seldom long
at a time, and he never had a fair
chance. He mostly made his home in
Ballarat and Sydney, where he was
greatly appreciated. When he left
early in 1864 he played a linal en-
gagement at Bendigo, then went to
Melbourne, and took passage for Png-
land. Very few knew of his depar-
ture, or anything about him, until
his appearance in Li| erpaol, where
he was very successful, and said to
be the host tragedian who had ap-
peared for many years. Fancy such
an actor being allowed to leave the
Melbourne stage without a farewell
engagement, when such a moderate
player as Ireland was sent home with
a flourish of trumpets. However,
Warner was a man who never paid
court to the critics, and they never
let on that he had gone home. I did
not know of it until I saw it in the
“Ballarat Star,” and afterwards in
the “Era,” whose critic thought a
great deal of him.
Sullivan was a failure till he went
into management. He was a deter-
mined man, and could not face the
thought of going home as a failure
out here, and so he went into man-
agement with a good company, hut
no Warner in it to take the wind out
of his sails. Low prices and pieces
well got up were put on, and he 'de-
served his success, for he gave a good
high-class entertainment cheap.
Though “Autolycus” praises him
more than he deserves, it was his in-
domitable determination, coupled
with fair abilities, any amount ol
vanity, and self-assertion and being
fresh that made him keep his position,
and also by trampling down, if he
could, any one who attempted to
rival him. So much for the great
Barry Sullivan.
Has judgment degenerated to brute
beasts, that such a fraud of an
actor as Bandman should be enrolled
among the long lino of fine actors,
finishing with, as he truly says,
William Crcswick, that have descen-
ded to us since Shakespeare. Nay,
perish the thought ; he was totally
unworthy to be placed in the same
street with them. Next, I am
pleased to see that “Autolycus”
could appreciate Harry Kelley, but
as to his big boots being four fee*
long, if he had said two feet he
would have been nearer the mark ;
who that saw him and La
Feuillade in the “Watermellon Man”
will ever forget them. I suppose La
Peulliade is still vegetating in Mel-
bourne, poor old fellow. I never see
his name now. Then in regard to the
Opera Company, Signora Lucia Bar-
ratti, otherwise Miss Lucy Barrett.
She could sing fairly well, but she


whs totally without dramatic ability,
and was quite lost in the great sit-
uations in tragic opera ; and as for
the tenor, Mariano Neri, he was
worse than her. The basso, Dondi,
was a fine man, a fine singer, and
also a fine actor, and saved the other
two from failure to a certain extent
by his great ability. 1 remember
being in ‘ Melbourne for a holiday
when they first appeared there. I
went to see them in “Lucrctia Bor-
gia" and in the great situation and
the trio at the end of the second act.
It was Dondi’s fine singing and
acting that in some sort carried it
through. I remember, just as the
applause died away—for the swinish
multitude will, as you know, ap-
plaud anything at times—a stentor-
ian voice from the gods in the gal-
lery shouted out in. tones that start-
led the house, and especially the
singers on the stage, the words,
“Very good, but we have had bet-
ter.” No truer words were ever
uttered in regard to, “We have had
better,” and “Autolycus” praising
them, when not long ago he was
praising Lucy Escott in the same
part made me use the expression in
regard to “brute beasts,” for who
that had not very long before seen
that glorious dramatic artist, Lucy
Escott, in the part, together with
that fine tenor, Henry Squires, and
that 'grand basso, Farquh.irsor., in
the same opera could praise such a
combination, of course, coupling
Dondi. 1 saw them afterwards on
Ballarat in (he Huguenots, and in
(he grand duet in the fourth act for
tenor and soprano, in which Lucy
Escott and Henry Squires always
produced such a great effect. It was
really painful to see .he welched
successors, however, no more of
them.
In regard to Charles Mat; hews, he
is wrong again in his facts about
him. lie never had anything to do
with the Adelphi Theatre. His father
was partner with Frederick Yales in
the Adelphi, and a good deal of the
money Matthews made with his “At
Homes” was lost in the Adelphi
management, which was a veritable
“sink.” Charles the younger came
on the stage first at the Olympic in
1836 in “He Would he an Actor,”
and in another piece called “The Old
and Young Stager,” the famous Paul
Pry—John Siston., being the Old
Stager. His colonial career is well
known.
♦ * ♦
I quite agree with “Autolycus” in
his opinion of Emmett. Drink was
his ruin ; he emied at last like poor
Charlie Young, Harry Kelley, and
Henry Wharton, in a lunatic asylum.
Henry Talbot 1 saw here in Mac-
beth, Sir Pertinax McSycohant. This
part was well acted. I also saw him
in Richard the Third ; he was a
strong imitator of Charles Kean ; in
fact, if you knew Kean well, and
closed your eyes as you listened to
Talbot you would think you were
listening to Kean, even to Kean’s
cracked voice. The idea of imitating
a man’s cracked voice, especially to
Kean’s way of saying, “In Bosworth
field will I lay to-night, but where
to-morrow, but all’s one for that.”
It was said . that Talbot was a


wealthy man, and made it worth
while for Manager White to engage
him. Certainly he had not the abil-
ity to qualify him to be a star actor.
Mrs. Scot Siddons was a hand-
some, charming woman and a clever
actor. Her Galatea was very clever,
but I should think her wonderful
grandmother’s body would turn in
its grave and burst its cerements at
tjie way she murdered Lady Macbeth.
Those were the parts I saw her in.
It seems there were really two in-
spired Hamlets, according to “Au-
tolycus.” They must have been
twins. 1 ne.er saw Edwin Adams,
but I believe he was really a fine
Hamlet. All that is gush about the
audience thinking they were on the
platform of the castle at Elsinore ;
it may be fine writing, but it makes
me sick when I read it. Adams died
in San Francisco of decline. His
father—A. A. Adams—was a very
fine actor, died of drink in America.
Many fine actors have, unfortunately,
died from the same cause.
I append a cutting from a journal—
“ Ristori’s name was won in
Italy and France, where her un-
unlikiely Quern Bess did not mat-
ter. In Australia she was rather
squab and washerwomany.”
I am glad to think there was at
least one ether critic besides myself
that was not led away by the glam-
our of the foreign tongue, as “Auto-
lycus” was. I have stated (hat she
was overrated.
“Autolycus” gushes about Mrs, Lin-
gard. She certainly was very good-
looking, but nothing to gush about.
She was originally Miss Alice Dun-
ning, a serio-comic at the London
music halls. Lingard was lion com-
ique at the same hall. They agreed
to pul that and that together, and
eloped. Lingard was in Melbourne
with a company sometime ago, play-
ing Old Men, but I don’t know where
lie is now. lie must he a great age
if alive, for he ha'd very little hair
on “the place where the wool ought
to grow” when he was here before.
He was a butterman in “Our Hoys,”
ai.'d she was a fairly good and plea-
sant actress in comedy, nothing more.
« * m
After losing llosa Dunn, Mr. Hos-
kins was fortunate in securing
another trump card in Anno Lock-
art, then just arrived in the colony.
She came out as Lelitia Hardy, in
the “Belle’s Stratagem.” Warner
was Uorincourt, Hoskins, Flutter.
Miss Loekart was a success, and
Hoskins, after the play, came on in
his managerial dressing gown, and
told the audience how pleased he was
he had beaten the Melbourne man-
agers by getting her to appear first
on Ballarat. He made a managerial
speech once a week, which his audi-
ence always enjoyed. Then we had
Annie Loekart in “The Wonder,”
“Beg Woffington,” “The Hunch-
back,” and many other plays. I
think she gave most pleasure as
Barthcnia in “Ingomar,” in which
we never had her equal, and with
Warner for Ingomar—one of his best
parts—and which the London “Era,”
speaking of, said, “If would be im-
possible to conceive a better repre-
sentative,” was always a great
success. Warner took his farewell in
1861, as Sir Giles Overreach, and
Ballarat lost its favorite actor, who


has never been replaced in popular-
ity.
In the sixtys we had a great num-
ber of fine players, whose places, sad
to say, know them no more. Among
the many were Hudson (Brooke’s
only rival in genteel Irish comedy),
John Drew, in low comedy ; the
Keans, ‘.Anderson, Montgomery,
Charles Dillon (what a fine Belphe-
gor he was), Charles Matthews, who,
fine actor as he was, never ousted
Hoskins in public favor ; and good
old George Coppin. How I remem-
ber him as Tony Lumpkin, with
Warner as Marlow O’Brien, Hastings
Rogers, Mr. Hardcastle ; John Dunn
as Diggory ; Julia Harland as Miss
Hardcastle; Rosa Dunn as Miss
Ne ille ; Mrs. Bellair as Mrs. Hard-
castle. What a gloriously casted
play, and to think that Mrs. Lewis
and George Coppin, of these fine ar-
tists, are the only ones now re-
maining alive. (Since these lines
were penned George Coppin has
passed away).
After the sixties there was a
slump, the age of mediocrities,, with
one or two exceptions, set in, and
it is in vain for “Autolycus” to try
to puff up into fame a lot of ordin-
ary stock players, and his praise of
Madame Ristori is overdone and ful-
some. He does the same about the
Williamsons, who, good as they
were in “Struck Oil,” were quite
equalled by Stuart O’Brien, whose
Deacon Skinner was a marvellously
good piece of acting, but then, of
course, successful managers are al-
ways well spoken of by the critics.
Among the early productions at
the Royal was an adaptation of
Goldsmith’s “Vicar of Wakefield,”
which was very well played, especi-
ally by Hoskins as Epriam Jenken-
sin, and Rosa Dunn as Olivia. The
Vicar was poorly played by Max-
well. Brown Rogers ought to have
been the, Vicar ; he would have been
an ideal Vicar. However, in the
afterpiece, “The Good for Nothing,"
his Tom Dibbles, with his catch cry
of “Sen I may live,” when Nan makes
him angry, was indescribably comic.
O’Brien’s Warry, and Rosa Dunn’s
Nan, too, could not be surpassed.
Rogers also appeared as Squire
Broadbands in the “Country Squire”
—one of his best parts.
The first Opera Company that ap-
peared at the Royal consisted of
Walter Sherwin, tenor ; John Gregg,
baritone; Mons. Coulson, basso.
They opened in ‘“The Bohemian
Girl, Sherwin, Thaddeus ; Gregg,
the Count Arnheim, in which his
■beautiful mellow voice was heard
with delight in “The Heart Bowed
Down.” Coulon was a splendid
Devilshoof, Julia Harland was a
delightful Arline, and Miss Octavia
Hamilton a very good Gypsy Queen,
and concluding with 20 minutes with
a Tiger Charley Beeswing. Hoskins,
with a 1 fine season, finished up with
the “Elixir of Love,” the only time
it was ever performed in Ballarat.
It was a delight to hear Donisetti’s
music so well sung. Coulon as the
Mountebank, was splendid, both as
singer and actor. He was one of the
finest artists ever heard here. There
were also revivals of the “Broken
Sword” and “Robert Macaire.”
Hoskin’s Robert was a striking pic-
ture of the French brigand, Brown,


and subsequently More, and especi-
ally J. W. Bruton were very humor-
ous in “Jaques Strop.” After that,
Henry Neil Warner joined the Com-
pany, which was then complete, and
never equalled here before or since
for ability, and I take leave to
assert, never surpassed in Melbourne.
Madame Carrardini took a benefit
here with Othello, (itheiio, flat cnee
Holt ; Desdemona, Mrs Clarence
Holt, both from the Charlie Mapitr ;
lago, Warner ; Emilia, Rosa Dunn,
concluding with the Beggars Opera.
Madame Carrai'dini was Captain
Macheath ; Rogers, Pcachum ;
Milne, Lockit ; John Dunn, Filch ;
John Oregg, Matt of the Mint ;
Julia Harland, Polly Pcachum ; Mrs.
Hancock, Lucy Lockit ; and Mrs.
Ray, Mrs. Pcachum There was a
crowded house. Then we had an ad-
aptation of Dieken’s “Barnaby
Rudge." Rosa Dunn was a capital
Barnaby, John Dunn an amusing Sim
Tappertit, Hoskins a splendid Mr.
Chester, and Stuart O’Brien as
Rudge, disguised as the Stranger,
gave one of the best bits ofcharacter
acting ever seen here. Another well
acted piece was “Christmas Eve, or
a Duel in the Snow.” Warner’s Sir
Charles Audry and Rosa Dunn’s Lady
Audry were finely aeled, and the
last scene, the duel in the snow
storm, was very effectively done.
“Lucille, or a Story of the Heart,”
taken from Bullwer’s “Pilgrims of
the Rhme,” a charming drama, and
splendidly acted. Warner as St. Cyr
de Vavasour, Rogers as a French
Attorney, and O’Brien gave another
fine piece of character acting as
Michel, an old brokendown French
Sohdier coming back from the wars.
"Charles the 12th” was also well
acted, Warner giving a fine picture of
the brusque monarch, and Bruton’s
Muddle work was very comic, There
was also a capital revival of Bouci-
cault’s comedy of “Old Heads and
Young Hearts.” Warner as Little-
ton Coke, and Hoskins as Tom Coke,
Rogers as Jessie Rural, and Rosa
Dunn were all in capital form, and
made a splendid combination. War-
ner and Rosa Dunn were successful
afterwards as Kucbcn Goldshed and
Lena Goldshed in that fine drama of
“Payable on Demand,” so successful
in London with the famous Fred
Robson in the principal part.
Amongst the many stars who ap-
peared at the Royal was James
Hudson, the Irish comedian. He was
the leading Irish comedian of the
day, but quite of another style to
Brooke, being much more exuberant
in his acting, and full of animal
spirits, but they were both so good
in their own way, it would be hard
to say which was the better. We
had George Coppin, too, in the “Art-
ful Dodger” and “The Wandering
Minstrel,” with Vilikins and his
Dinah, to everybody’s delight ; and
a fine production of Goldsmith’s
“She Stoops to Conquer.” It was a
treat to see it so perfectly acted.
Coppin also brought the Keans here,
and even at higher prices they drew
immense houses ; the very name had
a charm, though they were both past
their best form, and he never was, in
my opinion, in the first rank of
tragic actors, but he gave us a fine
rendering of Shylock and King John,


the Only time the latter play was
performed on Ballarat.
Henry Edwards attempted to play
the Bastard Fauloonbridge, but it
was only an attempt, for, in my
opinion, there have only been three
actors who could do justice to the
part in the last sixty years, and
were James Wallack, James Ander-
son, and Henry Marston, Mrs.
Kean’s Constance was very fine, but
her Portia had lost much of its
charm with advancing years. Henry
Wallack, brother to James, and
father of Julia Harland also, Who
was here to see his daughter, played
Sir John Falstaif, and showed what
a really fine actor of the old school
could do with the part. Hoskins
hu'd previously revived the play,
Henry the Fourth, Part I. Hoskins
gave a capital rendering of Falstaif—
but what could he not do in Shakes-
pearian comedy ? Clarence Holt,
—father of Bland Holt—played Hot-
spur to Wallack’s Falstaif. Holt
gave a very good, though rather
melodramatic version of the part of
Belphleggor, which suited him, but
he was not so natural as Charles
Dillon, who was the best ever seen
here. Dillon was also very good in
Virginius and Louis the Eleventh.
He played an engagement here, and
showed to much advantage in Corio-
lanus, and also in Macbeth, Charles
dc Moor in “The Robbers,” and
King Lear and the King of the Com-
mons in Macreadg’s old part. Mont-
gomery also was very successful here
in Hamlet. The very look of him
in the part had a great deal to do
with his success ; he seemed for ever
with his veiled lid to be seeking for
his noble father in the dust; hut as
to being inspired, and that fulsome
stuff that “Autolycus” writes about
him, it is simply ridiculous. We had
all of William Lyster’s Opera Com-
panies here, with that fine tenor,
Henry Squires, and that splendid
prima donna, Lucy Escott, the finest
dramatic singer ever heard in Aus-
tralia ; and Henry Wharton, that
fine baritone, and a lot of other fine
singers too numerous to mention.
The only thing Melbourne could beat
us in was in the mounting of our
plays. We had not the population to
pay for splendid mounting, though
some of them were finely got up.
Barry Sullivan never played here.
1 believe he came up to spy out the
weaknesses of the land, but I sup-
pose he thought us unworthy of hav-
ing such an illustrious actor as his
High Mightiness to shine in our
obscure town, but we could do very
well without him. After the sixties
there was a slump, an age of medio-
crities set in, except in a few
bright exceptions, such as Madame
Ristori, who was a very fine actress,
but certainly not worthy of "Auto-
lycus's” gush about her. Such stuff
as he writes about her defeats its
own object, and altogether the same
may be saM of what he says about
the Williamsons. They were very
good in “Struck Oil,” but it was the
novelty of the broken Dutch never
heard here before, and Maggie Moore’s
singing as much as the acting, to-
gether with Stuart O’Brien’s Deacon
Skinner, which tad quite as much to
do with the “Struck Oil” success.
O’Brien’s part was quite as well
acted as the Williamsons’ were, but


successful managers can always find
critics who will bestow upon them
praise, whether.they deserve it or
not. It is quite in vain for “Auto-
lycus” to try to galvanise into spas-
modic life such a lot of ordinary
stock actors and actresses as he has
lately keen trying to do, who are,
with a few exceptions, best forgotten
—at least, such is my opinion. Of
course I except Armes Beaumont,
Kmelie Melville, and Edward Farley,
who were worthy of all praise.
As a verification of some of the
opinions 1 have expressed in these
articles, I append the following opin-
ions of some of the English critics.
The “Ballarat Star,” of 1864 states—
“ The Liverpool magazine for Octo-
ber, under the heading of the New
Tragedian, has a very favorable criti-
cism of Mr. Henry Neil Warner in
some of his chief characters. Giving
the palm to bis Othello, it says,
‘ Mr. Warner made his first appear-
ance in Liverpool with what is con-
sidered worse than no reputation at
all—colonial fame, but though un-
heralded by puffery, and neither man-
aged nor papered, as is the fashion
of our lime, Mr. Warner nightly
.crowded with applauding audiences a
theatre which the legitimate drama
has heretofore failed to fill, even
when represented by Wigan and
Phelps ; and he did more than this,
he satisfied those whose appetites
for excellence not even prolonged pri-
vation can dull, that he possessed
finer qualifications for the tragic
drama than any actor who had ap-
peared on the F.nglish stage for many
years. The like of his voice has not
been heard since Brooke was Brooke,
his solid, placid, pregnant dignity of
utterance, attitude and look, even al-
low ing for a deficiency in polish, was
never excelled by Vandenhoff. The
originality of his readings is be-
trayed by the thoughtfulness without
the whims and restlessness of Barry
Sullivan, and his bursts of passion,
though w'holly different in style, have
sometimes much of the power and
safely peculiar to the school of Mac-
ready.’ The London “Era,” the
great theatrical paper, said of him
shortly after, ‘ Mr. Henry Neil
Warner appeared last night at Sad-
dlers Wells as Ingomar, adding ano-
ther leaf to the dramatic wreath his
abilities have already woven for him.
It would be scarcely possible to find
a more suitable representative of the
Barbarian Chief, whose rough attri-
butes cannot conceal the nobility of
his nature with every personal gift
in his favor. Mr. Warner acts with
that vigor and intelligence, being
careful never to diverge into pedantry
or rant, which can only r be the result
of great talent and long study and
experience.’ ”

Karly in the Sixties we had a
visit from Mrs. Lamond Butler, the
wi'dow of a splendid tragedian, who
fell dead in the streets of Manches-
ter, in England. She only played
here two nights—one as the Queen to
Warner’s Hamlet, and the other as
Lady Macbeth. She caused a sensa-
tion in the murder scene ; when she
was dragging Warner, as Macbeth,
off, he, with his face towards Dun-
can’s chamber, crying, “Wake Dun-
can with thy knocking ; ah, would
thou couldsl.” She dragged him
against the side scene with such
force that he was nearly knocked
down, and quite spoiled the situa-
tion. She was a very moderate act-
ress.
On Warner’s benefit he appeared in
that fine haymarkel comedy of the
“Heir of t'lairville, or an Husband
for an Hour,” in. which he appeared
with great effect in the triple
parts of Robert a gardener, the
Count de Clarvillc and Lord Thornly,
and as Rat 11 in Hob in the “Green
Hills of the Far West,” and in which
J. W. Bruton’s Bonaparte Scrubs
was intensely amusing. When Me-
Kean Buehanon was here Buehanon
and Warner alternated Othello and
lago night about, hut the audience
gave Warner so much the larger
share of the applause that Buehanon
lost his temper, and on his farewell
night he made a very ill-advised
speech, similar to Barry Sullivan’s
under the same circumstances, whin
the Melbourne audience called for
Warner in preference to him— the
great Barry Sullivan—a thing awful
to think of.
We also had a visit from the
Agatha States Opera Company. They
opened in “Krnani.” Miss Slates
was very fine as Elvira. Oil-ndim
was a splendid Charles 'he Tilth,
and Susini a grand de Silva ; Cecchi
was a moderate Emani (he after-
wards became the teacher of Mad-
ame Melba). The company staged
among other • operas, “Faust." in
which Orlandini Valentine and that
grand basso, Susini, Mephistophlcs,
was superb, They were supported by


those fine singers, Edward Farley and
Lucy Chambers, and gave a delight-
ful season of opera.
A very clever amateur gave a fairly
good performance of Othello. His
name was Henry Coulden. Warner
played lago, excellently acted. Mr.
and Mrs. G. H. Sims played an en-
gagement here also. She was called
the Australian Robson. I am sure I
don’t know why, but she was good-
looking, and an excellent burlesque
actress and singer. She played Ophe-
lia to Warner’s Hamlet for his bene-
fit, and played it well. Anne Lock-
art was the Queen, Bcllair doubled
the parts of the Ghost and Laertes.
Warner’s benefits were always events
here, and crowded houses always
welcomed him on those occasions. At
this time we had some fine perform-
ances of the “Wife and Delicate
Ground” as the afterpiece, with War-
ner as Julian St. Pierre and Citizen
Sangfroid, and Annie Lockart as
Marianna and Pauline, as good a
night’s performance as could be
wished for. Another fine revival was
George Colman's “Iron Chest,” in
which Warner gave a masterly repre-
sentation of Sir Edward Mortimer.
As previously stated, my first visit
to a theatre was to the Montezuma,
then not long opened, to see G. V.
Brooke in Othello —that was in 1855.
The palmy‘ age of the Ballarat stage
I always consider dates from
Brooke’s first appearance. How
great an Othello he was. About
that time Henry Birch was lago—
a very grod actor in heavy parts,
though I have, seen betder lago’s.
Robert Heir was Cassio, Mrs. Heir
a fine Desdemona, amd Mrs. H. J.
Rae a very good Emilia. Brooke
also, in addition to bis tragic parts,
played “O’Callaghan on his Last
Legs,” and Pearce O’Hara in the
“Irish Attorney.” Though the
prices were 7/6, 5/-, and 2/6,'the en-
gagement was a success. After him
came Mr. and Mrs. Clarence Holt,
the parents of Bland Holt. Clarence
Holt was a good actor in melodrama,
but a poor tragedian. Belphegor was
his best part, though his Macbeth
was fairly well acted. He .afterwards
became lessee of the Victoria Theatre
and produced Dumas’s “ Monte
Christo” in very good style. The sea
scene, with the rock and the Chat-
eau de If surrounded by the waves,
which covered the entire stage, was
well done, and about the best thing
shown in Ballarat of the sort up to
that time. He also produced Dunms’s
“'Three Musketeers” in good style,
though Williamson has announced that
his was the first production of “The
Musketeers” on Ballarat. Holt’s de
Arlagnan was well played, much bet-
ter than that of Cecil Ward’s. 11.
R. Robins made a feature of Car-
dinal Richeleu. He was a capital
heavy villian. He afterwards went
home and received a fair position.
Mrs. Holt was a very moderate lead-
ing actress. We also had the Gou-
genheim Sisters, who were deservedly
great favourites, but “Autolycus”
has told you all about them. Mr.
and Mrs. James Stark, the Ameri-
cans, who appeared in “The Rob-
bers,” but Anderson’s De Moor was
much superior to Stark’s, who was
not very much liked, his style of
acting being too much of the Boan-
erges style, and too ponderous to


suit Ballarat after Brooke’s, lie did
not draw well.
Late in the year 1855 Henry Neil
Warner made his first appearance on
Ballarat. He opened as Hamlet, and
at once tobk that place in popular
.favor, which he never 'afterwards
lost. His Hamlet at that time was
a \ery fine performance, but it was
unequal, and lacked finish and polish.
A year or so after, when he came
again to the Charlie Napier, he was
much improved, and gave a finished
piece of actings Joseph Henry Dunne,
or Judge Dunne, the barrister, as he
was then, and owner of the Ballarat
“Times,” wrote a very able and
glowing criticism on Warner, pro-
claiming him to be the finest Hamlet
ever seen in Australia. Warner also
appeared as Othello, lago, Macbeth,
Richard the Third, Rollo, Duke Ar-
ansa, Claude Melnotte, Citizen Sang-
froid in “Delicate (!round,” one of
the best bits of comedy acting ever
seen in Ballarat. Pctruchio, equally
good, and took his farewell for the
time as Matthew Elmore in "Love’s
Sacrifice,” one of his best parts. We
also had a visit flom Catherine
Hayes, whose vocalism 'delighted
everybody ; also Madame Anna
Bishop and Laglaise and Co don, the
French tenor and basso, two of the
finest singers in opera ever heard in
Australia., Then came Miss Coddard,
the finest actress in heavy tragedy
ever seen in Australia. She was very
fine in the Duches* of Malfi, Web-
ster’s old tragedy ; also in Queen
Elizabeth, Lady Macbeth, and she
was the best female Hamlet ever
seen here, but no woman can do jus-
tice to the part.
McKean Buchanon, the American,
also played here. He was an actor of
immensely powerful physique, and in
passionate speeches could thrill his
audience, but there was no light and
shade in his acting, and in Rhylock,
in parts after a hurst of passion,
which would thrill you, he would in-
dulge in such gesticulations as would
make you laugh like the old actors
before Macklin, the first great Shy-
lock’s time, used to do, making it a
comic part. He was very good in
Kichclcu and Richard the Third. Joe
Jefferson also came, and delighted
everybody in Rip Van Win' le and
Salem Scuddcr, and other parts. We
had a very fair stock company at tie
Montezuma. There was P. Hydes,
the lessee, a capital low cornelian,
and one of the oldest actors in the
colony; J. R. Oreiillc, the fa' orite
of all ; Henry Birch, E. W’. Shear-
croft, Stuart O’Brien, 11. J. Rae,
Webster Musgrave, a capital Polon-
ius ; Mrs. H. J. Rae, Mrs. Dale,
Mrs. Oakey, and the clever Chambers
family. Joe was the star of the
family, Mina Chambers was a good
dancer and a pretty girl. 1 had al-
most forgotten Charlie Walsh, the
singer and actor, famous here for
singing “Will W’atch, the Bold Smug-
gler,” and cigars and cognac, and
he was clown in the pantomime. I
believe he is alive yet somewhere in
Melbourne. Many of these appeared
at the Charlie Napier, where Italian
Opera was first properly produced rn
Ballarat. Signor and Si;mra Bian-
chi, tenor and soprano, took the
house. They were’, I think, two of
the finest operatic singers ever heard
in Victoria, and she was a magr-ifi


cent looking woman ; he was short
and very fat, but good-looking
withal. They produced for the first
time on Ballarat “II Travatore,” and
it was a great success. The parts of
Manrico and Leonora were never
sung better than by them. They
also produced Verdi’s Macbeth, At-
tila and II Loindardis. They were
deservedly great favorites, and they,
with Farquharson, that fine basso,
after sang in opera at the Theatre
Royal. Hudson played as his first
Ballarat engagement, Rory O’More,
O’Callaghan, The White Horse of the
Peppors, The Happy man, The
Knight of Arna, Ireland as it Was,
How to Pay the Rent, and other
parts, he was very successful. Brooke
also appeared here as Othello to an
immense house. That was in 1858,
Of course I went again to see his
Othello, but it was not the same,
lie had fallen off very much, and had
got dull and pompous, and his voice
was not what it had been, and there
was a general feeling of disappoint-
ment visible amongst the audience. I
went to see him also in Hamlet, but
he was 100 mature for the part, and
in spite of some fine acting here and
there was too robust for the melan-
choly Prince of Denmark, but his
Shylock, and Matthew Elmore, and
O’Callaghan were as good as ever
and a treat to see again. After he
left, Henry Neil Warner and Miss
Mary Provost appeared at the Char-
lie Napier in “Camille.” She was
the best Camille ever here. She was
also verv fine in the Countess of
Kppenstein in Sheridan Knowles line
play of “Love, or the Countess and
the Serf,” Warner’s H>mp, the serf,
was equally fine, and the play was a
great success. Equally so were they
as Master Walter and Julia in ‘‘The
Hunchback,” “Love’s Sacrifice,”
"Medea,” “The Love Chase,” and
other line plays. They also appeared
at the Charlie Napier under Hoskin’s
management in a fine revival of “As
You Like It.” Warner as Jaqucs ;
Stuart O’Brien, Orlando ; Chapman,
Oliver ; J. W. Bruton, Touchstone ;
Miss Mary Provost, Rosalind and as
Julian St. Peire and Mariana in the
Wife. It was a great success.
Rosa Dunn and her father (old
.lack Dunn, the English Jim Crow)
made their first appearance on Bal-
larat sometime before this. Rosa
played Creusa, Miss Provost Medea ;
and Warner, Jason. Rosa Dunn be-
came a favorite at once. What de-
lightful naivette she showed in “The
(iood for Nothing,” when she says,
“1 wish I had tuppence; I’d run
away, and so I would.” The How-
son family also appeared at the Char-
lie Napier. Among other operas
they produced Balfe’s “Enchantress,”
the only time it was ever sung on
Ballarat. Emma, the ci'.lest was a
fine singer, and became very popular
in England and America. The Vic-
toria was not so long lived as the
two other theatres ; it was burnt
down in the great fire. Mr. and Mrs.
Charles Young played their last en-
gagement in the colonies previous to
their going to England. They
appeared in “Masks and Faces” as
Peg Woffington and Triplet, the
“Married Rake,” “Black Eyed
Susan,” “Ben the Boatswain,” “Old
St. Paul’s or the Thirteenth Chime,”
and other plays, When Clarence


Holt left the Victoria he went
to the Charlie Napier, and opened as
Shylock. and William in “Black Eyed
Susan.” Con Warde was Antonio ;
F. T. Graham (a good actor) was
Gratiano ; R. W. Cox, Bassanio ;
Mrs. Holt, Portia and Black Eyed
Susan ; Miss Fanny Young, Nerrisa
and Dolly Mayflower. Lambert also
played at the Montezuma, but, good
actor as he w'as, he was not suc-
cessful.
As time went on, the West of Bal-
larat became more thickly populated,
and when the Western mines opened
out the East declined, and the
Theatre Royal carried the sw r ay, the
eastern theatres gradually declined
and lost many of their patrons, for
nearly everything was going West
then. Miss Avonia Jones and Fitz-
gerald also appeared at the Charlie
Napier in a drama called “Lurline,
or the Spirit of the Waters,” in
which she attempted to sing the
Clarion Song from the “Rose of Pas-
tille,” and also in “Camille” and
“.Medea,” but they failed to satisfy
play-goers, who were used to seeing
Miss Mary Provost and Henry Neil
Warner in the same characters. That
fine Shakespearian comedian, William
Hoskins, made his first appearance
here at the Victoria Theatre shortly
before if was burnt down ; also his
wife, nee Fanny Wallack, known as
Miss Julia Harland, the prima donna,
and Walter Shcrwin, the tenor ; and
Linlv Norman, conductor. They
sang in “La Sonnambula" without
any chorus, and concluded with a
fast train high pressure ft.p.ess.
Hoskins was Colonel Jack Delaware.
What a fine comedian he was, not so
polished as Charles Matthews, but
more body, and richer humour ; be-
sides Matthews could p;ay nothing
but modem comedy ; he was lost in
high comedy of the old school, while
Hoskins revelled in it. What a fine
Benedict he was, the finest we ever
had here, far superior to Montgom-
ery. On the same night as he ap-
peared here Farquharson appeared at
the Charlie Napier with his enter-
tainment a la Russell, the best we
ever had. He sang “The Tight Little
Island,” “Simon the Cellarer,”
“Kit the Cobbler,” “The Maniac,”
“The Ship on Fire,” “The Rambler's
Wife,” and told anecdotes as well as
Henry Russell himself. He came out
with the Hoskins’ parly from Eng-
land, but parted from • them here.
He was known in England as Far-
quharson Smith, and sung at concerts.
* ♦ * *
A correspondent has asked the
Editor to obtain my opinion as to
which was the best Irish comedian,
O. V. Brooke or W. O'Neil. Well,
Mrs. Malaprop says, “Comparisons
arc odorous,” but in this case I think
there arc none to be made. O’Neil
was distinctly an actor of the Irish
peasant class. His characters were
Barney the Baron, The Happy Man,
Handy Andy, and parts of that type.
He was always a good singer and
dancer, cn'l in that line of character,
excepting John Drew, he has had no
equal here ; he never attempted the
Irish gentleman. Brooke’s Irishmen
were of a higher class altogether.
How glorious was his Murphy
Maguire, and how fine his fox hunting
Pierce O’Hara in the “Irish
Attorney,” and, above all, his


O’Callaghan. Who that saw him in
it will ever forget him when, feeling
in his pockets for his money, the
humorous yet perplexed look, and the
indescribably humorous way in which
he used to say, “Come out, for con-
calement is useless,” and the look of
disgust when he says, “One and nine-
pence ; what can you do with a dirty
one and ninepence ?” And I think
Brooke has had no equal here except-
ing Hudson, in Irish characters. The
correspondent also asks for some ac-
count of James Anderson, the tra-
gedian. Well, Anderson made his
first appearance on the stage at the
age of one year snd six months, as
Cota’s child in “Pizzaro.” The
great John Kemble was Holla, and
then for years he wandered about the
country towns of England, some-
times very hard pushed even for
food, but constantly improving him-
self., At one time he got to London,
dead beat with fatigue and hunger,
and was standing on old West-
minster Bridge, looking down into
the Thames, wondering should he
jump into it if he would have reso-
lution enough not to swim ashore,
when T. P. Cooke came by and spoke
to Anderson. He had played with
him in the provinces. Anderson told
Cooke his troubles ; Cooke put his
hand in his pocket, took out a piece
of paper, wrote a few lines to Ken-
neth, the theatrical agent, and also
nutting a sovereign into Anderson’s
hand, wished him good luck, then
went rolling on his v.iv like an
English sailor, as he was, having
fought under Nelson at the Battle of
the Nile. Cooke was the greatest
sailor player ever known on the Lon-
don stage, and among my most
cherished recollections are ha/ ing seen
him as William in “Blackcyed
Susan,” Long Tom Collin, in the
“Pilot,” and the Monster in “Fran-
kenstein,” by Mrs. Shelley. After-
wards Macready played with Ander-
son in the country, and engaged him
to play in his great company at
Drury Lane and Covent Garden at
£8 a week, where he was the original
De Mauprat to Macready’s Hichcleu.
Anderson, in the fortys, was the
finest juvenile tragedian on the stage.
His Hamlet, Romeo, and Claude
Melnotte were very fine at this
period, as I can attest. He went
several times to America, and made
a great deal of money there. The
last time I saw Anderson in London
was at the old City of London
Theatre, in, Bishopsgate-strcet. It
was about 1850, and was his benefit
night. He played Macbeth, Delaval
in “Matrimony,” a two a;t comedy,
and “Hob Roy," a three act operatic
drama. Fancy that, ye degenerate
modern things, that call yourself ac-
tors. Anderson was receiving £6O a
week. The prices were threepence the
gallery, sixpence the pit, one shilling
the stalls (which were the first six
rows of the pit, no more), and the
boxes two shillings. The engagement
was tor, six weeks. For one week, he
often got £2O anight. In the latter
sixty’s he came out to Australia. In
'67 under George Coppin, he played
in Melbourne, in opposition to Mont-
gomery. His engagement was a
great success. He then came to
Ballarat for six nights, during which
he played Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth,
Claude Melnotte, and King Lear. 1


went every night to see him. He had
run into flesh in twenty years from
the fortys, and his Hamlet was too
robust ; his Othello was very good,
so was his King Lear, but nothing
like Macready’s. His Macbeth was
magnificent, especially in the last act
—something to remember ; his Corio-
lanus was superb. How magnificent
was his scorn when saying to the
Roman mob, “You common cry of
curs whose breath I hate as reek of
the rotten fens, whose love I prize as
dead carcases of unburied men that
do corrupt the air, I banish you.”
Mrs. Quickly, in “Henry the Fourth,”
used to say, '“I’ll no swaggerers.
Have I lived all these years to have
swaggerers ; I’ll no swaggerers.”
Well, a certain suspicion of a swag-
ger which I think his many visits to
America gave to Anderson’s manner,
and which was against him in Ham-
let was an advantage to him in Cor-
lolanus ; it suited the intense pride
and haughtiness of the character.
And then how magnificent was he in
the last act in Antium, when he
crys, "Cut me to pieces ! Volsces,
men, and lads ; stain all your edges
on me. Boy ! false hound ! if you
have writ your annals true, ’tis there
that, like an eagle in a dovecote I
fluttered your Volsces in Corioli.
Alone I did it, boy !” His Charles
de Moor in “Schiller’s Robbers,” was
also a magnificent piece of acting,
the bold, daring character of the man
being well suited to his large style
of acting, and he gave much delight
to all lovers of good acting out here.
He came to Ballarat, and played a
second engagement while the Duke
of Edinburgh was here. On that
night he gave a fine performance _of
the part of Duke Aranza in the
"Honeymoon,” and also of Delaval in
“Matrimony,” as the afterpiece. The
Duke was there to see him a portion
of the evening ; the other portion
the Duke spent at the banquet given
in his honour, and seeing the grad’d
torchlight procession, the finest ever
given here. While here Anderson pro-
duced the fine play of “The King of
the Commons,” and played the King
very finely, though not, of course, as
well as the great original, Macready,
whom no other actor could approach
in that character, or in very few
others for that matter ; he stood
alone among actors as a tragedian.
Anderson’s engagements were very
successful on Ballarat and through-
out the colonies. When he died, his
relations being all dead, he left all
his money—some £4,ooo—to the
General Theatrical Charity Fund.

Comments on “ Autolycus.”
“Autolycus,” in his otherwise in-
teresting article on William. Cres-
wick, the tragedian, makes some
strange mistakes. He says he was a
popular actor, Sn London in the
Thirtys, and that he was a leading
member of the great Covent Garden
Company organised by Macready in
1840, and that up to the time of
Macready’s retirement in 1852, Cov-
ent Garden was the.central home of
tragedy. IV; also says he learnt how
to play Richelieu from his long so-
journ there, by seeing his great
leader, Macready, build up and per-
fect the part. Now, Macready’s
management of Covent Gardea com-
menced on the 30th of September,


1837, and ended in 1839. There were
two other managements there that
year, W. J. Hammond’s and Charles
Matthews and Madame Vestris. Mac-
ready then took Drury Lane for a
couple of years, after that he never
went into management, and he
retired from the stage in 1851 at
Drury Lane, as Macbeth. Now, I
say distinctly, that Creswick never
was a leading actor in London in the
Thirties, and also that he never was
a member of any of Macready’s com-
panies at either of those houses.
Creswick first played when quite
young at the old Queen’s Theatre, off
Tottenham Court Road, under Mrs.
Nisbett. He also played a short
time at the old Pavilion Theatre,
Whitechapel ; he then went into the
provinces for years at £1 a wee';,
under good old George Coppin’s
father’s management, and became a
popular tragic actor in 1815, at the
commencement of the winter season
at Sadlers Wells, under the famous
management of Phelps Greenwood and
Mrs. Warner. He made his first real
appearance on the London stage as
Hotspur in the first part of “Henry
the Fourth.” George Bennett was
the King, Henry Marston the Prince
of Wales, Phelps was Sir John Fal-
staff, and Mrs. Henry Marston Mrs.
Quickly. After that he played lon to
Phelps, who played Adrastus ; then
he played Pierre, in “Venice Pre-
served,” then Romeo in the first re-
vival there of “Romeo and Juliet.”
Phelps was Mcrcutio, George Bonnet,
Friar Lawrence ; Laura Addison,
Juliet ; Mrs. Marston, the Nurse ;
and William Hoskins, who had lately
joined the company, was Benvolio,
After the first week Phelps, who was
a poor Merrillio, gave up the part to
Henry Marston, who was perhaps the
best Mcrcutio on the boards at that
time. After Crcswick left Sadlers
Wells he went to the Princess
Theatre, Oxford-street, to play sec-
onds to Macready. He afterwards
supported Mrs. Butler, nee Miss
Fanny Kemble. That was the first
time he played with Macready in
London, and would be about 1818.
All this I can vouch for, as 1 was a
constant frequenter of Sadlers Wells
at that time, as well as of other
London Theatres,
“Autolycus,” in his criticisms on
Anderson and Montgomery, speaks
very slightingly of Anderson, but he
was the better Othello, Macbeth,
Claude Melnotte, Ingotnar, Shylock,
Richard the Third. He was that big
and stout that he could not look
Hamlet, but for all that he played it
well, though, perhaps, a bit ; too tem-
pestuous at times ; but to show you
the unfairness of the criticism you
have only to notice be says that
stick—Rob Heir’s—lago was sounder
Sha'-espcrian work than Anderson’s
Othello. When Anderson first came
to Ballarat it was for one week, and
I went every night to see him. He
played Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth,
Claude Melnotte, Charles de Moor
in “Schiller’s Robbers” and “King
Lear.” Bob Heir played, or at-
tempted to play, the Ohost, Macduff,
Pouscant, Frances do Moor, Kdgar,
and lago. ' 1 have seen fifteen lago’s,
not counting CL V. Brooke’s, who
was so rir-nk that they had to drop
the curtain on him, and Hoskins took
up the part. Bob Heir’s Iaf?o was


the poorest of the lot, hut any stick
is good enough to beat a dog with,
and the Melbourne critics at that
lime took sides. Now, the Anderson
side wants publishing to be fair all
round.
♦ ♦ *
As for Montgomery, he was . per-
haps the best Hamlet—the most
finished, but it was weak in parts ;
he had no physique, and so when he
attempted to be forceful his passion-
ate outbursts were unnatural and
forced, and his voice became strained
and disagreeable to the ear in my
opinion and that of many others.
Warner’s Hamlet, if not so finished a
penormance, had much more brilliant
acting in it, notably the second act,
including that magnificent outburst
of passion at the close, in the speech
beginning, “Now I am alone,” which
has never been equalled in its deliv-
ery by any tragedian who has ever
visited Australia, and also in the
Closet Scene. For fulsome gush
“Autolycus” bangs Bannagher, and
they say Bannagher beats the devil.
I have never dropped across anyone
who saw Mwntgomery’s Hamlet leave
the theatre with a broken voice and
tears in their eyes, and say, “Now
cracks a noble heart, (!ood-night,
sweet Prince.” And again, he says,
"To be or not to be,” was never re-
alised or understood by the audi-
ence before Montgomery spoke the
lines. This is, of course, fine writ-
ing, but it is a direct slur on all
the fine Hamlets we have had in
Australia, who at least understood
Shakespeare as well as Montgomery,
if their external gifts did not suit
the part of Hamlet as well ns his
did but if he was such a heaven-
born Hamlet and other Shakespearian
characters, hew is it he was such a
moderate success in England. Surely
the people in London know good act-
ing when they see it. it was his
failure there, together with tus loss
of money in. management in trying
to convince the thick-headed London-
ers of his super-excellence that was
such a blow- to his vanity which
caused him to commit suicide. Put
peace to his . name, he was a fine
actor in certain characters. Think of
the Hamlets we have had here—
Edwin Booth, Brooke, Warner, Stark,
Sullivan, Dillon, Kean, Anderson,
Montgomery, Adams, Buchanon,
(Teswick, Howe, Hayner, Dampicr,
Fairclough, Dewhurst. When shall
we sec another good Hamlet. I for-
got (ieorge Miln. I don’t say they
were all good, far from it.
Like lago, I am nothing if not
critical, though I must allow that
the articles by “Autolycus” are very
pleasant reading, even if one does not
always agree with him. But I want
fo ask, “Did Montgomery ever mes-
merise you ?” “Autolycus” says he
mesmerised his audiences. There can
be no doubt he did “Autolycus,” for
he saw qualities in him that were
never visible to me. I suppose I
was too thick-headed to see them.
Fancy poor old Cun Warde's Othello
being praised ; how the poor old
fellow would be delighted could he
again revisit the glimpses of the
moon. He certainly was a careful
actor, and mostly knew his lines,
but his Othello—mention it not in
Oath. I remember about the year
1857 or 1858, at the old Charlie


Kapler, Henry Neil Warner piayed
his second engagement on Ballarat
with Miss Mary Provost. He played
Hamlet, and Joseph Henry Dunne,
barrister, afterwards Judge Dunne,
and also part proprietor of the old
Ballarat “Times,” wrote a long
critique on Warner’s Hamlet, and it
took its place after that as the best
Hamlet Australia had ever seen, and
kept it till the advent cf Montgom-
ery’s, which so fluttered the dove-
cotes in Corialli, after which Warner
had to take second place, which has
been conceded to him ever since,
though some of us old identities still
kept true to our opinion that Warn-
er’s Hamlet was the best, being
more manly, and, in ; arts, much
more powerful, and being totally
divested of many affectations and
laekadaisacal airs that Montgomery’s
Hamlet was afflicted with. But, as I
was saying, after playing Hamlet
Warner played Julian St. Pierre in
“The Wife,” then Othello and lago ;
Warde was lago. Don’t ask me what
it was like ; as for his Othello, the
Ballarat “Times” confessed they
hardly knew what to say about it,
but they confessed that it was fear-
ful, unmatchable, never to be for-
gotten by those that saw it, which
was quite true, for I w r as one of
those unfortunates who had to see
it, but it was for the sake of seeing
the lago of Warner, which was
nearly as good as his Othello. So
much for Warde’s Othello. As to
“ Autolycus’s" remarks on Lambert,
they arc fair enough, for he was an
excellent actor, but his humour was
very hard, and wanted unction, in
which quality both Coppin and Rogers
were much his superior. What a
splendid east that was in “The
School for Scandal,” for his benefit.
What would we not give to see such
a cast nowadays. “Autolycus” says
hardly anything of Rogers, who has
never had a superior in his line out
here, nor an equal, except Lambert
and Coppin. lie was a private in the
Fortieth Regiment in Tasmania in
ihc forties, and played as an ama-
teur. The officers of the regiment
were so impressed with his abilities
that they subscribed the money and
bought his discharge, and we reaped
the benefit. Who that saw them can
forget his Tom Dibbles in the “Good
tor Nothing Solomon, in “The
Stranger Morriset, in. that fine
play, “Retribution Diogenes Hun-
ter in “A.S.S.;” and Karlhworm
to Charles Matthews; Affable
Hawk, in “The Game of
Speculation,” and a host of other
parts I won’t mention. We had
Rogers at his very best on Ballarat
when the old Royal opened, and for
nearly a year after ; then he went
to Melbourne, and when next he
came to Ballarat was but a wreck
of bis former self, breaking up fast.
What rot “Autolycus” has written
lately about pantomimes —heaven
save the mark !—and the handsome
Jenny Winston, who was a tall thin
woman, and was like Miss Snellica’s
papa in “Nicholas Nickleby,” who
could do everything a little but not
much, and who introduced songs
into the part of the dour Helen
Macgregor in “Rob Roy.” Fancy
Helen Macgregor singing 1 A woman
who would cut a man’s liver out as
soon as look at him. What good


taste she showed ! “Rob Roy” is
an operatic drama, but neither Rob
nor his wife should sing in it, and
the lovely Klcanor Lang, and others
who 1 will not mention ; but 1 con-
tend that the palmy days of the
drama in Ballarat and Melbourne
commerced in 1855, when G. V.
Brooke first appeared, and finished
about the ’7O, and except
Crcswick, we have never had a really
fine aetor here since, and Crcswick’s
powers were on the wane when he
came here. Fairclough was a good
actor, but not fine enough, too
preachy in his elocution.

Henry Marston, Actor and Orator.
A few recollections of a very re-
markable actor, one who was c. uch
adinired by play-goers, and by his
intimates both admired and beloved.
Rickard Henry Marsh, professionally
known as Henry Marston, was the
son of Dr. Marsh, a Wiltshire phy-
sician. He was articled to a London
firm in the law, but, becoming an
amateur actor, he, in 1824, made his
first appearance on the stage at
Southampton, as Romeo. The fol-
lowing year he was engaged at Salis-
bury by Pcnson, and opened as Flor-
ian in the “Foundling of the Forest”
at £1 a week, the highest salary
given in the theatre. He supported
the great Edmund Kean, and one
night, after playiing lago to Kean’s
Othello, Kean said to him, “You are
the best lago I have ever played
with.” Marston smiled. “What are
you smiling at,” said Kean. "Be-
cause,” said Marston, “I know three
other Tago’s you have said the same
thing to.” “Have 1,” said Keaa,
“then I must be a greater humbug
than I thought I was.” He playad
Macduff to Vanderhoff’s Macbeth,
Ulric to Macready’s Werner, and
Romeo to Charles Kemble’s Mcr-
cutio. He, after playing at many
provincial theatres, had a long en-
gagement at Bath, then the nursery
of actors for the London stage. While
there he was engaged and made his
first appearance on the London stage
in 1839, at Drury Lane, under W. J.
Hammond’s management as Bene-
dick, and won the—at that time—
rather singular honour of being called
before the curtain after the play.
After that he was a member of Mac-
ready’s famous company, and at the
conclusion of his management he
went to Sadler’s Wells under Green-
wood', ns leading actor and stage
manager, where I first saw him in
1843. Among his most remarkable
performances there, was his Mephis-
tophiles in Gratton’s drama of
"Faust, or the Demon of the Drach-
cnfells.” It was something to re-
member. One scene in particular, a
churchyard by moonlight, with the
church at the back, the stage covered
with here and there straggling tombs,
on one of which, clothed all in red,
a tight skin dress, mt hat, and red
feather, a sword, the hilt of which
had a small skull on it, stood Mars-
ton, as he said—
“ Demon of the midnight hour,
Now working out your awful doom,
Aid me with thy magic power,
And show me the wretch within.”
At the last word Marston waved his
hand, a loud clap of thunder is heard,
and one of the tombs is shattered,


and, opening, a fleshless skeleton is
seen in the tomb. The effect was
'cry weird and thrilling, and startled
the audience. I saw him there in
Howard Payne’s tragedy of “Brutus,
or the Fall of Tarquia, the first
tragedy I ever saw. Howard Payne
was the author of “Home Sweet
Home ; he was an American. Mars-
ton’s lago was, perhaps, his finest
part ; it was remarkable for its in-
finite variety. He was all things to
all men. To Othello he was bluff and
soldier-like, to Desdemona he was
kindly, to Cassio he was friendly ai d
comrade-like, to his wife he was sar-
castic and snappish, 'o Uoderigo la-
joling and contemptuous, though he
only let the audience sec his con-
tempt. But it was in his soliloquies
you saw the real nature of the man.
His intense hatred and jealousy of
Othello, which would only be satis-
fied by his having wife for wife, and
his egotism and delight in his \il-
lainy. It was a remarkable perform-
ance, and had no equal except Mac-
ready, and that was mainly owing
to the superiority of Macready’s
voice. His Mercutio, too, was the
finest on the stage. There was a
lightness and a buoyancy and eleva-
tion and evidence of high breeding
that made it truly delightful to see
and .'-cry enjoyable. Hoskins was cer-
tainly not much behind in the part ;
perhaps he was less refined, and
played more to the gallery. Mars-
ton’s Benedick was equally good, his
witty contests with Beatrice, played
by that delightful actress, Miss
Cooper, were something to be re-
membered. The same remarks ap-
ply to Hoskin’s Benedick, which was
a line performance. 1 think I re-
member seeing in Tallis’ Shakespeare
a portrait of Miss Cooper as Helena,
in a “Midsummer Night’s Dream.’’
Marstbn and Henry Neil Warner
played two fine engagements together
in London—one at the Standard, the
other at the Pavilion. They appeared
alternately as Othello and lago,
Hamlet and The Ghost, Macbeth and
Macduff, Brutus Cassius and Marc
Antony in Julius Caesar, and in
Lord Lytton’s comedy of “Money.
Warner was Kvelin, and Marstou
Graves—a splendid combination ;
would I had been there to see it.
Marston was a prominent Free-
mason, and was often called upon to
speak at their meetings, and he also
was a member of the famous Urban
Club, who held their meetings at St.
John’s Gate, Clerkenwell, built by
the Knight of St. John in the middle
ages. At these meetings his speeches
were the delight of the members ;
they were always impromptu. Few
had studied Shakespeare like he had,
and none reverenced him more, and
he was regarded as an apostle in his
art. On one 23rd of April, the birth
and death of Shakespeare, John
Oxenford, the dramatic critic of the
“Times,” being called on to propose
the toast of the drama, called on
Henry Marston to respond to the
toast, than whom, he said, there was
no one who more exactly represented
all that was noble and dignified in
the profession to which he belonged.
Laman Blanchard said of Marston,
“That the eloquence and earnestness
of his speeches would never be for-
gotten by those whose privilege it
was to hear them.” The poetic elo


qucnce of his language swayed the
sympathies of all who heard him with
a force absolutely mesmeric in its in-
fluence, never hesitating for a word,
never involving his sonorous senten-
ces in a confusion of metaphors, hut
pouring a stream of eloquence,
brightened by the happiest illustia-
tiens, he held them spcilhoumi by the
magic of his tongue, ami, when all
was over, one spntaneous burst of
declamation was heard. There was
not a single listener to that magni-
ficent speech but felt his heart had
been stirred to its utmost depths,
and his mind become illumined with
a stronger light that would (liable
him to sec more clearly the higher
attributes of the art so earnestly
and so persuasively advocated. Henry
Marston died in. 1883, aged 7!t.

In regard to Creswick, I was not
aware of his visit to America, or had
forgotten it, but he certainly went
to the Princess Theatre from Sad-
lers Wells, and played son nd to
Macready and Mrs. Butler. I well
remember his Master Walter in “The
Hunchback” to her Julia, and es-
pecially his Amintor in the altered
version of Beaumont and Fletcher’s
old maid’s tragedy, altered by Sheri-
dan Knowles, andl called, “The
Bridal,” and in which Macready was
so fine as Melantius ; then he went
to the Kaymarket. After his first
partnership with Shepherd at the
Surrey Theatre I saw much fine act-
ing. Then Anderson joined Shepherd
in (he management till the house
was burned down. Shepherd re-built
the Surrey, and opener! with “Theo-
dora, Actress and Empress, Jfiss
Avonia Jones being Theodora. The
reason Creswick left Sadlers Wells
was, being a small theatre, and the
prices, gallery sixpence, pit one shil-
ling, dress circle three shillings, no
stalls, and a few private boxes. It
was marvellous how it paid for so
many years, but as soon as Greecr-
wood—the business manager—retired,
things went wrong. Phelps, of
course, managed the stage part well
enough, but he missed his partner in
the other department, and he *ut his
own son—a poor actor—in Henry
Marston’s parts, and Marston left
and the public were degenerating, and
•so came the end of a grand Shakes-
pearian management, in which he pro-
duced more,than thirty of Shakes-
peare’s plays. Honour to him.
Well, Creswick left because, partly,
there were no parts for so many fine
actors, as well as the expense of
jiaying a man who was not wanted,
for Henry Marston was an immense
favorite, and if Creswick played
second to Phelps—for he, of course,
took first part—then Marston or
George Bennett were left out of the
caste, as Phelps was in “Romeo and
Juliet” and “Venice Preserved,” and
George Bennett the regular Cassius,
was* from “Julius Caesar” when
Creswick played Cassius, one of the
last parts 1 I saw Creswick play
there, so he left. At the Princess he
took the lead on the nights Mac-
ready did not play ; the latter only
played three nights a week. When
he was there, Creswick succeeded the
famous James Wallack, the uncle of
Julia Harland. Wallack went to
America some years after, and
founded the famous Wajlapks Theatfo


in New York. He died at his country
residence on the Hudson River. He
was a magnificent actor in many
parts, and Marston’s only rival in
lago, Macduff, Faulconbridge, Bene-
dick, Mcrcutio, Peeruchio de Mau-
pat, Marc Antony, The Ghost, in
Hamlet, and many other parts.
Marston, as I know, did play at the
old ramshackle Oxford Theatre. When
there he dramatised Sir Walter
Scott’s ‘‘Highland Widow,” and
played Hamish, the widow’s son, in
it. He was the first leading actor I
ever saw ; that was in 1848. I saw
him first at Saddlers’ Wells, in the
“Jew of Lubeck.” Shortly after I
saw him as Sir Edward Mortimer,
in George dolman's “Iron Chest.”
I have never seen a finer one. I also
saw him in a great number of parts
there before Phelps and Mrs. Warner
joined Greenwood, who then had the
lease of the house, and entered into
partnership. Of course they wisely
retained Marston to play second to
Phelps, and the lead when Phelps
took a rest, and there were many
leading parts he could play better
than Phelps could. It was only the
want of a better voice that kept him
from being the equal of Macready :I
remember seeing his portrait in Tal-
lis’ Shakespeare as Marc Antony. I
thought at the time I saw it, how
many years ago it was. It was too
full in the face, but the one as Hot-
spur—l think it is in Tallis’—is a
perfect likeness.
• * •
I was amused with “Autolycus’ ”
account of W. G. Carey. He says he
was a young actor, trained at Ben-
digo, came to Melbourne in Decem-
ber, 1871, and appeared there. Well*
I don’t know where he was trained,
but this I ‘do know, that about the
year 1862, one evening I went into
the bar of the Charlie Napier, I sup-
pose for a drink, when I saw on a
play-bill, hanging behind the bar—
“Theatre Royal, Oastlemaine.
‘Othello.’ Othello, Henry Neil
Warner ; lago, W. G. Carey.” Well,
sometime after that Warner came to
Ballarat, accompanied by Annie
Lockart, Harry Jackson, and W.
G. Carey. They came out in Shir-
ley Brooks’ “Creole, or Love’s Fet-
ters,” and Carey played the part of
Alphonse de Nyon. After that en-
gagement finished Warner went to
Sydney, and played there for nearly
a year, and then came and played
his farewell engagement on Ballarat.
That was early in 1864 ; he then
went to England, after playing a
fortnight at Bendigo when be left
here. W. G. Carey must have been
a dozen years on the stage when he
appeared in Melbourne, so he was
not so very young. That is like
“Autolycus”’ facts ! Now, every-
thing I have written is written from
memory, so I don’t often give
dates, but when Ido so you may
depend on them being as infallible as

A few remarks upon the great Sir
Henry Irving. It may seem presump-
tions in me, who never saw him, to
express an opinion as to his merits,
but I have followed his career ever
since he made his first great hit in
the Bells, and read .every sort of
criticism both in his favour and
against him, and I think I am quali


tied to give an opinion on him, and
it is this, that he never was a great
Shakespearian actor. The only char-
acter in which he really was suc-
cessful in Shakespeare was Shylock,
which he played up to the very last.
All the rest he dropped out of his
reportoire years ago. If he had really
loved Shakespeare, he would not have
had the heart to give up Shakes-
peare for such second-rate plays as
“Docket,” “Louis the Eleventh,”
“Waterloo,” “The Courier of Lyons,”
“The Dells,” and only Shylock re-
maining of all his other Shakes-
pearian parts, for he was so popular
with the public that even his faults
with them were beauties, and his
tricks of elocution and spasmodic
gestures were attractive to his idola-
trous admirers, and would have
drawn houses, and good ones, e\en
if he was an indifferent interpreter
of the Dard of Avon. Of course,
when he produced them they were
made spectacles of, and cut and
hacked a good deal to suit his pecu-
liarities, but there was bound to be
some fine acting in anything he
played, for there is no 'doubt he was
a fine actor out of Shakespeare. His
Hamlet, when he first produced it,
ran a long time, but the way he
played it was novel, and the season
of long runs had set in before that.
His Richard the Third also ian for
some time, but his Macbeth was a
total failure, as was his Othello
His lago was very fair, anil when
played to Edwin Month's Othello,
and alternated with him, was, of
course, bound to draw well as it did.
His Romeo was laughed at, as it
was 100 ridiculous, but Helen Terry’s
Juliet helped to carry it along for
awhile. His last great revival of
Shakespeare’s “Coriolanus,” on which
he spent several thousand pounds,
was a perfect frost ; his Coriolanus
was that bad, as I said it would
be when I saw it announced. He
should have produced “Antony and
Cleopatra,” for Ellen Terry would,
at least, have been a bewitching Cleo-
patra, even if she could not have
given a good interpretation of the
darker side of the character of the
Serpent of Old Nile ; but he wanted
to have all the fat of the part he
played to his share, and he gave her
the Old Woman Volumnia, a part
totally unsuited to her, and in doing
so caused the play to fail ignomin-
ously, as he deserved to do. That is
my opinion of Henry Irving.
« ♦ •
I know it is very daring for an
outsider to pick out inaccuracies in
anyone belonging to the sacred circle
who has, like “Autolycus,” for so
many, years been in the habit of tell-
ing us poor ignorant play lovers
what actors' we should admire, anil
when the seal of their approbation
had been set on them it were heresy
to differ from such mighty critics.
However, whatever fate awaits my
effusions, they have passed away an
idle hour or two, and, being a sort
of hermit here, for I seldom go out ;
about once a week I take a consti-
tutional, and go over the back of
Hlack Hill.
“Autolycus” having finished his
course, Othello’s occupation (other-
wise mine') of commenting rn bis


criticisms, has gone. I hope i have
not tried my readers’ patience to the
breaking point. I don’t know
whether any of them noticed the fol-
lowing in the “Bulletin ”
“ ‘ O’Fipp ’: Various 'Argus' re-
ferences to the brilliancy of W. M.
Akhurst’s ‘historical burlesques,’
produced at Melbourne Theatre Royal
in the ’6o’s, led me to struggle
through the book of ‘ The Battle of
Hastings.’ Its beauties consist mainly
of puns. Here are a few samples :
And for this son and heir I’ve set a
snare.
Your Highness. Yes, your eye on his
crown you’ve got.
Although you play first fiddle in the
State,
1 tell you, King, you are a vile in-
grate.
Nearly every line contains puns,
many of them worse than those
quoted, and yet an ‘ Argus ’ writer
says Akhurst was ‘ always good,’
und wonders that none of his bur-
lesques have been revived during the
last quarter of a century. Perhaps
Akhurst’s early connection with the
‘Argus’ as musical critic blinds it to
the mediocrity of his stuff. Some
recent musical comcwies have been
poor enough, but almost anything
would be preferable to a resurrec-
tion of the Akhurst tripe."
This has always been my opinion
of those high-flown descriptions by
“Autolycus” of, I suppose, friends
and fellow-contributors much over-
praised burlesques, but, as Dick
Swivcller sai'd in Dickon’s “Old
furiosity Shop,” “May the wing of
friendship never moult a feather.”
“Autolycus” seems to tie of the
same opinion as Dick, and he cer-
tainly is faithful to his old friends,
several of whom I believe are still
in this work-a-day world.

Miss Titell Brune.
I daresay you will be saying with
Macbeth, “What, will the lino
stretch out to the crack of doom,”
but, at the risk of > that, I am leaping
once more into the breach. We went
to sec “Romeo and Juliet,” so, of
course, 1 must express my views on
the production. First, then, I think in
cutting portions of it out very had
taste has been shown by those that
mutilated the work ; next, that Miss
Tittell Brune—Tittell, ye gods, what
a name, but I suppose she can say
with . Shakespeare, “What’s in a
name.” A rose with any other name
would smell as sweet. Well, I think
her, in spite of an occasional Yankee
twang in her speech, as far as the
three first acts are concerned, ja de-
lightful Juliet, much better than the
much lauded Essie Jennings ; in fact
good enough for anything, but often,
when the crucial scenes came, she
was wanting in power and passion'
The first note of (his was in the
friar cell in the fourth act, in the
speech beginning, “Tell me not,
Friar,” an 1 ,! in the next, beginning,
“O, bid me leap,” and in the potion
scene there was a great falling off.
Khe moaned and crouched about the
strge, and seemed as though she
realised (be horror of (be ordeal she
had to undergo, yet she appeared,
save for half a dozen words, where
she speaks of dashing out her des-
perate brains, to totally want the


passion and power to express her
horror of the situation, and I, who
have seen such a number of fine
actresses who have electrified the
house in that scene, was, of course,
dissatisfied, but, for all that, it was
a, charming, (performance, and to
those who have not seen many Jul-
iets there was nothing wanting, and
her Juliet was perfect. As tor the
Romeo, Greenaway, who is a Bal-
larat boy named Green. Well, the
Romeo was as heavy as lead, and
unlike the fervour and passion of an
Italian, such as Juliet ought to have
inspired him with, and make him
play up to her better. Old as I am,
it would have fired my blood, I am
sure of that. Redgrave, in Mercutio,
was better, but I, who remember
Hoskins so well, and who was the
only really fine Mercutio ever seen
in Australia, of course was not sat-
isfied. You know there is what is
called high comedy, which is quite
distinct from light comedy. Now,
Mercutio belongs to the sphere of
high comedy, and requires something
tmdefinahle in the way of presence,
an 1 ,1 a certain air of high life, which,
those who saw him, will remember
Hoskins had, in spite of the exuber-
ance of his spirits, which was de-
lightful to watch. Now Redgrave,
though a capable actor, gave a
light comedy version of the part. He
wanted the presence and high comedy
manner. There was an exuberance of
posturing and gesture, which were
quite out of place in such a part, and
his Queen Mah—which, by-the-by, was
shamefully cut short—was a disap-
pointment ; hut for all that he
played well, and though, with a little
100 much trying to be funny, he de-
lighted his audience. He is a good
actor, and I like him very well. As
for the Friar, he spoke some of his
lines passably well, but made noth-
ing of his first speech, which is one
of the finest in the play. The Apo-
thecary showed a grain of intelli-
gence ; as for the rest, they
mouthed it so. I had as lief the
town crier spoke the lines ; the
Nurse, especially, was vile.

Henry Neil Warner—An Appreciation.
As Warner has taken so prominent
a part in my “Recollections,” and
as it could hardly be otherwise,
seeing how much he played on Bal-
larat, in the early days, I will make
a few marks about the good points
of his acting in some of his best
parts. “Autolycus” says he was
the handsomest actor on the stage
of his time. I will not go so far
as to endorse that opinion. He also
says that his voice was so beauti-
fully modulated and mellow that
ladies fell in love with him, to the
annoyance of their cavaliers. Cer-
sainly he had a good figure, a noble
carriage, a fine stage face, black
curly hair, and brilliant black eyes,
and his voice was, I think, the
finest ever heard here, being very
powerful, and also very melodious in
its tone. His best part was, I
think, Hamlet, and in which he had
sense enough not to spoil his good
looks by wearing an hideous red or


fl&xea wig, as some fine actors are
fools enough to do, because, for-
sooth, the Frenchman Fechter did so.
One good point in his Hamlet was
its manliness. Montgomery was al-
ways crying, like Job Trotter, with
■his blue pocket handkerchief. Warner
showed his grief for his father enough
by his bearing and the tones of his
voice without whining it. tie also
pointed his sword backward, as
“Autolycus” says was first done by
Montgomery, when he says, “By
heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him
that lets me,” and which, if he
“Autolycus) had read Hazlitt’s cri-
tique of Edmund Kean’s Hamlet, he
would see he used to do so ninety
years ago. And next, how tender
and reverent was Warner’s delivery
of the speech to the ghost, begin-
ning, "Angels and Ministers of grace
defend us,” and all through that fine
scene. And the second act, how fine
he was, especially in that magnifi-
cent piece of declamation, beginning,
“Why, what a rogue and peasant
slave am I,” in which he seemed to
run through the whole gamut of the
passions, and in the play scene his
passionate intensity in watching (he
King, and as the King leaves the
scene, culminating in the triumphant
outburst he cries, “Why, let the
strucken deer go weep, the hart un-
galled play,” was something to
remember by those whose privilege it
was to see it. The Closet Scene
with the Queen was equally good.
How fine was his delivery of the
speech beginning, “Look here on this
picture and on that.” The last act
was equally fine, as he finishes say-
ing to Horatio, “And ip ttys harsjt
world draw thy breath in pain to
tell my story.” How fine, too, was
his Othello. What a noble simplicity
in his bearing. Warner’s Address to
the Senate has never been equalled
here except by Brooke, when Brooke
first arrived in the colonies—never
since. And./then in the Quarrel Scene
at Cyprus, How grand he was. How
Cassio seemed almost to shrink into
the ground as Warner, in that won-
derful pathetic tone of voice says to
him, “Cassio, I love thee, but never
more be officer of mine.” In the
third act his bursts of passion were
quite electric. How fine he was in
the speech beginning, “Never, lago,
like to the Pontick Sea.” And in. the
pathetic farewell speech, and so to
the very end, when, as he stabs him-
self, he cries, “I kissed thee ere I
killed thee ; no way like this, kill-
ing myself to die upon a kiss,” and
clutching at the curtajins of tfie
bed, he falls prone on the body of
Dcsdemona. Warner’s lago was also
very fine ; it had great variety, and
the soliloquies were simply .magnifi-
cent, delivered with that wonderful
voice of his with such fine elocution
Equally fine was his Richard the.
Third. How fire was his, “Now is
the winter of our discontent.” How
his pointed, bitter sarcasm came out
in this part, where he says to his
wife, “To me you have the worst
of faults, outlived my liking,” and
his, “Thou troublest me ; I am not
in the vein and his, “There let
him sink, and be the seas on him,
white-livered rumagate, what does
he there ?” And in the last Act,
how r fine was his Slave, “I have set
my life upon the cast', and I will


stand the hazard of the die,” till
he falls, still fighting, on his knees,
and then falls on the stage dead.
Warner’s Macbeth was also very
fiae, especially in his Address to the
Air, drawn dagger, and the whole of
the Murder Scene. How fine and
full of anguish was he 100, as he
said, “Mcthought I heard a voice
cry, ‘ Sleep no more, Macbeth hath
murdered sleep,’ ” and his anguished
cry of, “Wake Duncan with thy
knocking ; ah, would’st thou
could’st.” And the last great Act,
how pathetic was his cry, “She
should have died hereafter,” till,
fighting to the last, he falls, killed
by Macduff. He falls on the stage,
not like a common man, but like
the ruin of a Slate.
Warner’s Sir Giles . Overcach 1 have
already spoken of, so will only add
that excepting Rrooke, who was
great in the part, Warner’s Sir Giles
has never been equalled here. His
Shylock was also a splendid piece of
acting, especially in the scene with
Tubal and the Trial Scene. His
Romeo, for which he had special
qualifications, was also a great suc-
cess. Especially in the balcony
scene it was full of youthful glow
and passion, and the scene in the
friar’s cel! and the last scene were
magnificent. Another of his best
parts was Sir Edward Mortimer, in
“The Iron Chest.” The picture of
the proud man, still writhing under
the thought of having received a
blow, and remorse for having killed
the striker, was very powerfully ex-
pressed. In comedy he was almost
as good as in tragedy. , Mis Petru-
chio, how fresh and full of life was
his acting, /especially in his witty
contests with Katherine, when she
flouts him and says to him, “There’s
my haind ; take it it you dare.’’
How Warner’s splendid voice rang
out, as he cried, “Were it the fore
paw of an angry bear I’d wring its
off,” but, lowering his voice to a
sound like melodious music, he says,
“But as it’s Katherine, I’ll kiss it.”
In “Love’s Sacrifice” his Elmore
was unequalled, except by Brooke.
What a splendid piece of declamation
was his delivery of the speech be-
ginning, “Suspicion, ’tis the fabled
Upas.” A London critic said that
his delivery of this speech, and the
one from Hamlet, “Why, what a
rogue and peasant slave am 1,” were
the two finest pieces of declamation
to he hoard on the English stage of
that time. How fine, too, was his
scene with his daughter, where he
tells his story to her of how he
killed Del Lormc. How fine he also
was in Aranza, in the ‘Honey-
moon,” and how superior to Charles
Mathews’ Jemmy Jessamy style of
acting in Citizen Sangfroid, in “Deli-
cate Ground,” ‘was he. Warner's
Sangfroid had a quiet dignity, en-
livened by a touch of feeling that ex-
actly suited the part—and what a
charming Pauline was Annie Lock-
hart. And in “Rule a Wife and have
a Wife,” how nobly his Leon, when
he throws off the slough of the lout,
and stands forth to defend his wife’s
honour from the libertine Duke.
What a sensation he caused among
the audience, and how fine Hoskins,
as Michel Peres, played up to Warner
in this p'ay.
As these articles arc approaching


completion, I will, with the per-
mission of the Editor of this paper,
say a few words about them to
those kind friends who have honoured
me by reading them, in case they
think I have been too hard on “Au-
tolycus.” First, let me say, that
everything I have written is from
memory. I have no notes or old
criticisms of my own to refer to,
yet I vouch for the truth of anything
1 have said in contradicting any
statement. As the Editor of this
paper can vouch for, these articles
were written at the same time as
those of “Autolycus” appeaml in the
press. I had no intention of writing
anything on the subject, hut after
rea'ding some of the articles contain-
ing such fulsome praise of certain
favorites, and his many mis-statc-
ments about others, that I took to
writing my opinions on the same
players, and also my comments on
“Autolycus’s” articles, to a gentle-
man friend long residing in Fitzroy,
and well known there, never thinking
they would he published. But, at the
same time, let me say I would not
have modified them one bit had I'
known they would he published. My
motto has always been to write as'
Shakespeare advises us, “Nothing
extenuate, nor set down ought in
malice.” And still I cannot help
thinking if “Autolycus” were alive,
how disgusted he would he that so
many of the little fairy tales he told
about players were exploded to his
confusion, though no doubt he would
profess to treat my writings expos-
ing them as unworthy of notice. It
has been a source of gratification for
me to write about those fine old
actors who afforded me so much plea-
sure in my early manhood by their
fine acting, especially in their Shake-
spearian characters, and whose
places, sad to say, know them no
more, ahd for whom, as Hamlet
says, "the rest is silence.” The old
actors had power, passion, and im-
agination—the modern school of ac-
tors have none of these qualities ;
but, I forget, they have that won-
derful quality, called for want of a
belter name, “suppressed force,” hut
which quality is so much suppressed
that I have failed to see that they
had any force to suppress. The in-
spired Montgomery was, I think, the
first prophet of the suppressed force
school, though, in, his case, there was
considerable merit in his use of the
qualify, not for any liking he really
had for suppressed force, but his
physical power, or lung power, which
ever you like to call it, being small.
When it failed him he fell back upon
suppressed force, though the passion
in his case was more observable than
in that of most modern prophets of
that school.
• * *
In the period I am writing about
the play and the acting was the
thing, or, as Hamlet says, the play
is the thing, Now-a-days it seems
to be the' mounting, not the acting
or the play. When Williamson pro-
duced “Romeo and Juliet,” the way
thet glorious poetry was cut about
disgusted me. It reminded me of what
the great equestrian and horse
rider, Andrew Duerow, used to say
to his playwright, when his dialogue
seemed likely to obscure the merits
of the horse, “Cut out the cackle


and bring in the horses*. ” William-
son seemed to say, “Cut out the
poetry (or enough of it to spoil- the
beauty of it) and bring in the
scenery.” Truly does Shakespeare
say, “The world is still deceived by
ornament.” In the prehistoric ages
of the drama—the fifties and sixties
on Ballarat I am writing about—
it was a matter of no small diffi-
culty getting to the play from where
I lived and still live in the classic
shades of Ncrrina, about three miles
out of the City of Ballarat ; and in
winter lime, owing to bad roads and
flooded creeks, it took an ardent
lover of the dratna to face the diffi-
culties ; but 1 can truly say with
Coriolanus, “Alone I did it.”
Speaking about Andrew I'uerow, I
should have added that he was the
inventor and first performer of nearly
all the famous feats of horsemanship
we sec at the circus njw-a days. Ho
was the owner of Astly’s Air phi-
theatre, and when it was burnt down
in the early forties, and bis favorite
performing horses were burnt, it
broke his heart, and he died and was
buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.
His wife, Miss Woolford, who was
herself a famous horsewoman, erected
over his remains a monument that
cost £BOO.
“But let us return,” as the French-
man said,, “to our muttons,” that is,
the Ballarat Theatre Royal. In
1859 Mrs. Robert Heir played there
for a fortnight with Warner and
Hoskins strong Company. Though
it was winter, I remember I wcnt_
six nights ouft of the twelve. The '
plays ,wiere—“As You Like It,” “The
Wife,” “The Stranger,” “Love’s
■sacrifice,” “Macbeth,” “King Renes
Daughter,” “Lady of Lyons,”
“Ladys Battle,” and “Romeo and
Juliet,” a real dramatic feast. The
night 1 went to. see the “Lady of
Lyons,” some amusing incidents hap-
pened. Old Jack Dunn, an inveterate
practical joker, by some blunder was
cast for the part of Gasper, which,
though a small part, can be made a
great deal of by a good actor, and,
certainly Jack Dunn made a good
deal of it, though in the wrong
way, for when he told Warner—who
was, of course, Claude—that he was
driven from Pauline’s house with
blows, and says, “I would go through
fire and water to serve you, Claude,
but blows to a Frenchman,” he
doubled himself up as if he still felt
the blows, and in his most comical
manner he cried, “Yes, several
blows,” and sent the audience into
fits of laughter. What Lord Lytton
would have said had he been there,
I don’t know. Perhaps he would
have said, as Joe Jefferson used to
say in the “Yankee Teamster,” when
the apple barrel burst, and his apples
all ran down the hill, and the boys
gathered round him. to hear him
swear, “Well, boys, language aren’t
equal to the occasion.” Later on in
the play, when Beuseant threatens
Pauline with a pistol, and Warner,
as Claude, rushes on, takes her in
his arms, and, snatching the pistol
from Beuseant, points it at him, an
excitable old gentleman in the pit
jumps up, and, in a voice of thunder,
shouted out, “Shoot the b
shoot the b ! shoot him ! the
sensation was great. For the rest of
the night (hat old gentleman was


the hero of the scene. The Ghost
tells Hamlet that sleeping in his
orchard was his custom always of
an afternoon. Well, in those days
we had no orchards, but, on Satur-
day afternoon it was the custom of
us diggers to leave off our work at
dinner-time, and after dinner, with
our wives (those who were fortun-
ate enough to have wives. I had a
good bne ; would (She were here
now. But regrets are idle). One of
those Saturdays I shall ne/er for-
get. Myself and wife, and the one
olive branch we had then—like the
rest of the diggers—used to go into
the town shopping ; so we went on
this well remembered day. In those
days there were no papers delivered
in the bush, but, after doing our
shopping, 1 looked at the play-b;ll
as usual. It was Macbeth. Macbeth,
Warner ; Macduff, Hoskins ; Banquo,
O’Brien ; Duncan, Leslie ; first witch,
Rogers ; first singing witch, Julia
Harland, to conclude with the farce
of A.S.S. Diogenes, Hunter ; An-
tony, Rogers ; Sniggles, Jack Dunn.
What a treat ! The weather was
threatening, blowing great guns, but
•we determined to risk it, and we
did. “Macbeth” went off splendidly,
as it was bound to do with such a
cast. I should have said Mrs. Rob-
ert Heir was Lady Macbeth. After
Macbeth I went out—as the saying
is—to sec a friend in the theatre
bar, but mainly to look at the
weather. It was still blowing great
guns, with now and then a heavy
drop of rain, but Rogers and Dio-
genes Hunter’s claims were too
strong to be resisted, so we waited
to see it. How good he was as the
cantankerous old fellow who is going
to marry his daughter, and to pre-
sent the bridegroom with a service
of plate with his initials engraved on
it, A.S.S. lie then quarrels with
the intended bridegroom, and breaks
off the wedding, but is horrified to
think what he shall do with the
plate with A.S.S. on it. The only
way to remedy the catastrophe is to
get a bridegroom with the same
Initials. And he gets Antony Snig-
gles (Jack Dunn) to take the posi-
tion. To see Rogers in this part is
the only way to realise how i»de-
scribab ly humorous he was, lan-
guage fails in attempting it.
Well, the play being over, myself
and wife started for the classic
shades of Nerrina on our rough
journey. Cabs would not venture on
such a night. We had not got far
when the gates of heaven opened, and
down came the rain in torrents, with
thunder and lightning. The wife
wrapped her shawl tight round her-
self and child, to protect it from the
weather, and then I first realised
Lear’s description of the Storm on
the Blasted Heath, when he says,
“Poor homeless wretches, whereso-
e’er you are, that bide the pelting of
this pitiless storm, how shall your
houseless heads and unfed sides, your
looped and winds wed raggedness
put up with seasons such as these.”
However, all things come to an end
sometime, and so did our terrible
journey home, and we soon had a
roaring fire in the sod chimney, a
hot supper, and, after that, some-
thing hot out of ’the cat on the
bottle, a favorite drink in those
days, and we went to bed, and next


day felt no ill effects fitom our ter-
rible journey. But we were young
and strong, and life was : pleasant.
Gold was plentiful, and one could
always get enough for comfort it
one really tried, and we all hoped
some day to dome on it rich, and
small things did not worry us then
as they do now, when, as the grave-
digger in Hamlet sings, “Now, age
with his stealing steps has got me
in his clutch.” But to quote “Ham-
let” again, “We defy Augury. There
is a special Providence in the fall of
a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to
come. If it be not to come it will
be now. If it be not now, yet it
will come ; the readiness 1 is all,
since no man. has aught of what he
saves, what is it to leave betimes.”
But it is time these articles were
finished. After the end of the sixtys
there was very little to write about.
Othello’s occupation is gone.
What is writ is writ, would it were
worthier, but lam not now that
which I have been, and my visions
flit less palpably before me, and the
glow which in my spirits dwelt is
fluttering faint anvl low, and I re-
main with my memories.
