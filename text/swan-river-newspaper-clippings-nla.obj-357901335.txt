Affray with the Natives at Swan River. —
The India Papers of July, just received, contain the following
account of an affray between the natives and the emigrants
at the new Australian settlement on the Swan:—“ Up to
the sth of May last the natives had been friendly to the set-
tlers, but on that day they first showed hostile feelings in an
attempt made by some of them to commit some petty theft
in the settlement of Perth. A quarrel ensued, the military
were called out, and before'the affray could be quelled, the
natives had seven of their number killed, and one officer and
three of the military were wounded by spears. The natives
on this occasion sFlowed no signs of alarm or fear at our
musketry, but on the contrary a great deal of daring and
spirit. From the tops of trees, the chiefs harangued their
tribes. They dared our men to fight, and one of them was
so bold as to advance, and with his waddie to knock a cor-
poral down in the ranks. This is the most unfortunate cir-
cumstance that could have happened for the welfare and
prosperity of the colony. The natives on the Swan have
neither houses nor clothing, and nothing yet resembling a
boat or a raft has been found amongst them. They were to
be seen on the banks of the Estuary,, where they resort to
spear the fish, which abound on its shores, and all along the
coast, and of different kinds, but particularly a kind of rock-
cod, which is excellent. In their endowments the natives
are the same, and carry the same sort of spears as those of
New South Wales—the woraera, or throwing stick, and the
waddie. The spear is about 12 feet long, and as thick as a
man’s finger. They harden one end by burning, and attach
to the point of it, with a kind of black pitch or rosin, a wooden
barb. The waddie is a short stick, about two and a
half long and one inch in diameter.” /IV3O -

Sipce the departure of the St. Leonard several vessels
have reached this from. Van Diemen’s Land and New South
Wales, in addition to those from -England ; by them a con-
siderable quantity of sheep and cows have been imported, as
well a# of plank, bricks; 6cyu
This live stock has not realized prices equal to what
might-have .been expected had ouratettlers been longer in the
colony, and overcome the inconveniences and difficulties in-
separable from landing their'property, and conveying it to
their locations in a new country. Hitherto few have been
sufficiently forward to alloyv.of the additional incumbrance of
stock.
Single ccvws Jjave ffl c l l *d abont SO/. to 551. ; hut a parcel
of 12 ware sold in ene lot, at 20 i. per head.
( , A lot of sheep, say 310. of mixed breeds, were sold at 475.
per head. Bollocks may hr valued at 25/., fit for the
butcher. Live stock appears to be so low at Van Diemen’s
Land and New South iValtje, that at present the Cape will
hardly bo-iable to compete.with these colonies. The horses
and sheep which .have arrived from England aro of the best
quality ; but considerable time, must elapse before their pro-
duce will interfere importations.from either your colony
(Cape of Good Hope) or those above-mentioned. The Par-
! melia is daily expected, on her return from Java, with bul-
locks and ponies ; and tho brig Thompson has sailed for
Hobart-town, with an engagement with Government to land
bullocks here, at 161. per head for freight and forage. These
bullocks will be obtained from the government herds, at an
average of ,8/. each, thus fading, .on delivery, : ISZ. per
head.
The,insecurity of the Rncho ; rjng-in Gage’s Roads during
the winter months may probably increase the premiums of
insurance until the channel in the Cockbnrn Sound is pro-
perly buoyed off, and regular pilots he established. Since
the equinox we have riot experienced any gales, and the
masters of ships have to complain paly of the inconvenience
of discharging cargo on an open beach, where no erections j
