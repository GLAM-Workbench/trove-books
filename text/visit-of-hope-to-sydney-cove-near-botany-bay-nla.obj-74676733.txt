VISIT of HOPE
T O
SYDNEY COVE,
NEAR
BOTANY BAY.
Whe RE Sydney Cove her lucid bofom Twells,
Courts her young navies, and the ftorm repels;
High on a rock amid the troubled air
HOPE flood fublime, and wav?d her golden hair;
Calm?d with her roTy fmile the tolling deep,
And with Tweet accents charm?d the winds to deep;
To each wild plain Ihe llretch?d her fnowy hand,
High-waving wood, and Tea-encircled llrand.
? Hear me,? Ihe cried, 46 ye riTmg Realms ! record
? Time?s opening Tcenes, and Truth?s unerring word.-
? There lhall broad llreets their {lately walls extend,
? The circus widen, and the creTcent bend ;
? There , ray?d Trom cities o?er the cultur?d land,
? Shall bright canals, and Tolid roads expand.
? There the proud arch, coloflus-like, bellride
? Yon glittering dreams, and bound the chafing tide;
66 Embellilh?d villas crown the landTcape-Tcene,
? Farms wave with gold, and orchards blulh between
? There lhall tall Tpires, and dome-capt towers aTcend,
? And piers and quays their maliy llru6lures blend;
? While with each breeze approaching veTTels glide,
? And northern treaTures dance on every tide!?
Then ceas?d the nymph tumultuous echoes roar,
And Joy?s loud voice was heard Trom Ihore to Ihore-
Her graceful Heps defending preTs?d the plain,
And Peace, and Art, and Labour, join?d her train.

Mr, Wedgwood, having been favoured by Sir Jofeph Banks with a fpecimen
of clay from Sydney Cove, has made a few medallions of it, reprefenting
encouraging Jrt and Labour , under the influence of to purfue the employ-
ments neceflary for rendering an infant colony fecure and happy. The above
verfes were written by the author of ?t ï¿½otanic , to accompany th
rned allions.


Yours faithfully,
You are familiar, of course, with the picture of the Wedge-
wood medallion on the tltlepage of Phillip?s Voyage. It must
be very scarce in Port Jackson clay, but there are two in Sydney ?
at the Mitchell, and the Australian Museum. Wedg|wood did it
in the ordinary English clay used by him at the time, and of this
we have a specimen just now. Spencer must put it in his next
List, and give you a chance of purchasing it. Curiously enough,
the Mitchell does not appear to possess it, although it has the
rarer one.
With kindest regards.
