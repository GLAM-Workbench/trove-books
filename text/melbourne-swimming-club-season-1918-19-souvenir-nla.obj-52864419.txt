1894 M.S.C 1919
TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY
©N Wednesday, 3rd October, 1894, a meeting
was convened by Mr. E. Casper at the
George Hotel of those interested in the formation
of a Swimming Club at St. Kilda. Mr. S. G. Pirani
presided, and the forty gentlemen present resolved
to form a Club under the title of 'The Melbourne
Swimming Club.” Such is the brief newspaper
reference to the inauguration of that strong and
influential body in the swimming world of Australia
to-day, and which celebrates its twenty-fifth year
this day. Mr. E. Casper was elected the first
Secretary. A further meeting was held on the
17th October, at which the rules were adopted
and it was decided to affiliate with the Victorian
Amateur Swimming Association.
The first Members’ Carnival was held on the
24th November. An interesting feature of this
Carnival was the exhibition of Captain Boynton’s
Swimming Dress in which he crossed the English
Channel, and the piece de resistance was the ability
of Mr. Alexander Rushall to extricate himself,
under the water, from a walking costume after
being sewn up in a weighted bag. and emerge
within a few seconds in fancy costume.
The first year was brought to a close with a
successful Smoke Concert at the George Hotel,
at which the distribution of prizes took place.
The outstanding features of the intervening
periods may be briefly summarised as shown on
the following pages.

INTER-STATE CLUB CONTESTS
SYDNEY S.C. v. MELBOURNE S.C.
'T'HESE CONTESTS were inaugurated in 1910
between the Sydney and Melbourne Swim-
ming Clubs, whereby each Club visits the other
every alternate year to contest a series of all-round
events limited to a team of eight.
Each Club is represented by three competitors
in Diving, 440 yards Free Style, and 100 yards
Breast Stroke. Points are allotted according to
the place each competitor wins in the event
(7,6, 5,4,3,2 points respectively for the six places).
The team gaining the majority of points in each
event wins the event.
In 500 yards Teams’ Race, and Water Polo,
five points are awarded the winners, and three
points to the losers.
In the case of a tie in the number of events,
the Club scoring most points wins the series.
No trophies are awarded, each man competes
for the honor of his Club.
The founder of these contests, George T. Hill
of Sydney, died of wounds received in action on
Gallipoli.
Of the Melbourne Teams, Stanley Crane, James
Duncan Gordon, William L. Harris, and Clarence
Powell were killed in action in France. It is
proposed that a Memorial Cup should be competed
for to perpetually associate their memory with
the contests.

COMMITTEE’S REPORT
Gentlemen, —
In presenting to Members the Annual Report and State-
ment of Accounts for the season 1918-1919, your Committeee
is gratified with the results achieved, and pleased to record
that it still maintains its leading position in Victorian Swim-
ming. The season's programme consisted of numerous
weekend races, Members’ Carnival, and several successful
social events.
MEMBERSHIP
The past season has been notable for the large increased
membership roll, which consisted of a total number of
294 financial, excluding those Honorary Members who have
not yet returned from active service, which must be consid-
ered highly satisfactory. The Register comprised six Lire
Members, 60 Soldier Members, and 294 Financial Members.
FINANCIAL
Reference to the Statement of Accounts will show that
the season resulted in a surplus of £l6/2/3, of which
, £ 13/18/9 has been appropriated to write down assets. The
accumulated fund now stands at £127/15/4.
STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS
The conclusion of hostilities has opened the way for a
resumption of sport on a pre-war basis, and the Council of
the V.A.S.A., at its meeting on the 10th April, 1919, carried
a resolution for the continuance of the Australian Champion-
ships during the coming season, when it is also intended to
revive the State Senior Championships.
WEEK-END HANDICAPS
The numerical strength of the Club was responsible for
the large number of entries received for the above events,
and your Committee records with pleasure the lively interest
takn by the Members in these races. The principal handi-
cap event was the “Wallace Mitchell Cup," which comprised


a series of three races over 100, 200 and 300 yards. The
entries received were excellent, and much enthusiasm was
demonstrated in each of the contests. Your Committee
desires to congratulate the winner, Mr. T. W. Mason, and
runner-up, Master E. C. Slade, on their performances. Much
of the success achieved was due to the untiring efforts of
the Club handicapper (Mr. H. A. Bennett).
MEMBERS’ CARNIVAL
The Club was favored with an ideal day for its Members’
Carnival, which was conducted at the St. Kilda Baths, on
Saturday, 15th February. The splendid entries received
added much interest to the afternoon's sport.
THE STANLEY CRANE MEMORIAL HANDICAP &
THE POWELL MEMORIAL SEALED HANDICAP,
both of these handicaps, which were inagurated last season,
were again the chief features of the programme. A particu-
larly fine contest was witnessed in the Squadron Race,
which resulted in a dead-heat between two junior teams,
and the swim-off was equally exciting. Your Committee
was so impressed with the splendid performance of the boys
that it decided to award a second trophy.
JUNIOR SWIMMING
Interest of Juniors was greatly stimulated by the competi-
tion for the "George Shrimpton Cup,’' which attracted large
entries, so much so that the donor (Mr. Geo. Shrimpton)
granted a Consolation Trophy .
The Junior Championship of the Club attracted only two
competitors, and was won, after a keen contest, by Master
A. Staley, from Master 11. Robertson. Results as follows :
50 Yards —Ist, A. Staley, 2nd, H. Robertson. Time, 30
seconds. 100 Yards : A. Staley, 11. Robertson. Time 1 min, 10
1-5 secs. 200 Yards: 11. Robertson and A. Staley. Time,
2 min. 53 2-5 secs.


The City of St. Kilda Solicitors’Junior Championship,
which is open to junior members of Clubs affiliated with
the V.A.S.A., was won by Alaster A. Staley (Melbourne),
Alaster H. Robertson (Alelbourne) filling second place, and
Alaster J. D. Haig (Essendon), winner of the City of Alel-
bourne 'Corporation Junior Championship, was third.
Results: —'Fifty Yards: A. Staley, 1; 11. Robertson, 2; F.
Fontaine (City), 3, Time. 29secs. 100 Yards: A. Staley,
1: H- Robertson. 2: J, D. Haig, 3. Time, Imin. 9 2-ssecs.
200 Yards: H. Robertson, 1; J. D. Haig, 2; A. Staley, 3.
Time, 2min. 52 l-ssecs. Points —A. Staley, 12 ;H. Robert-
son, 11; J. D. Haig, 5.
VISIT TO “THE DIVE”
The annual trip to "The Dive” took place on 23rd Febru-
ary, in perfect weather. The members were heartily wel-
comed by the President ( Councillor Proudfoot) and Secre-
tary (Mr. R. Day), of the Surrey Park Swimming Club.
Over fifty members took advantage of the opportunity of
visiting this famous swiming basin. As usual a handicap
race, for trophy presented by the late Airs. 11. A. Bennett,
was held. Afore than 30 entries were received, necessitating
five heats and semi-final. The race was won by Air. C. F.
Husbands.
SOLDIER MEMBERS
A Roll of Honor of members of the Club is published in
the Souvenir Report. *
Since the last Annual Meeting, your Committee records
with regret the untimely death at sea, soon after leaving
Australia, of Lieutenant J. L. Doubleday, former com-
mitteeman, captain of the football team, and a popular and
active member of the Club; also Gunner J. D. Gordon
(runner-up in Junior Championships, and member of the
Interstate Teams 1911-1912, 1912-1913), and Gunner F. L-
Bloch, another popular member of your Club, both of whom
were killed in action. Your Committee extends its deepest
sympathy to the bereaved relatives of the above-mentioned
members. It has been learned that many members will be
back in Victoria before the commencement of the season.


INTER-STATE CLUB CONTESTS
Your Committee has been in communication with the
Sydney Swimming Club, regarding the resumption of the
above contests, and it is anticipated that same will be con-
tinued during the forthcoming season. In the ordinary
course of events these competitions will take place at your
Club’s Open Carnival during the currency of the season.
INTER-ALLIED MILITARY SPORTS
At the Inter-Allied Alilitary Games, in Paris, this year,
one of your Alembers (an ex-Champion of the 'Club),
Gunner Ivan Stedman, gained third place to the fast Ameri-
can swimmer, Norman Ross, in the 100 metres free style
event. Gunner Stedman was also awarded the medallion
of the Royal Humane Society (England) for a brave rescue
of an English soldier from drowning, in the under-growth in
the muddy waters of the River Somme (France). Alembers
will join in congratulating him on these two meritorious
performances.
CLUB ROOM
For the convenience of Alemhers, twelve (12) Lockers
were erected in the Club Room, and were readily availed of.

held, the attendance being:—
