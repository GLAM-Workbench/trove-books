Once upon a time there was a
small flock of sheep who lived in
a quiet shady paddock.

There were some little lambs
amongst them.
Mrs. Southdown had a son who
was called "Edward."
Mrs. Merino had twins who
were called "Amy and Mollie."
And Mrs. Crossbred had a son
who was called . . .

The Black Sheep of the Family!


His name was Leicester and
he was pitch black.
His mother did not mind, she
loved him dearly and said she
liked lambs that colour. But . .

everyone expects a black sheep
to be naughty and lead others
astray.
And Leicester happened to be
remarkably good.
Whenever Amy, Mollie and Edward
ran off and got into mischief
Leicester stayed
at home and made
daisy chains!

Whenever Amy, Mollie and Edward
squeezed through the fence and
played with the lambs in the next
paddock (although they were told
not to).
Leicester stayed
at home and
helped Mother!

As you see he was a very
little lamb. Besides, he was
shy.
All the other lambs would
him, and their Mothers would
"Now come here children, <
let the Black Lamb lead
astray! "
One day Leicester went
a walk all by himself,

and he came across two Dingoes
walking along. One was
carrying a big bag.

Leicester was terrified. He hid
behind a tree until they had passed,
and then he hurried home as
fast as he could.
That is the best place for a lamb
to be when Dingoes are about!

He got home just in time to have
afternoon tea with his Mother.

Suddenly there was a
great to-do in the paddock! Amy and
Edward said something TERRIBLE had happened.


Mollie had been taken off by
the Dingoes!

Everyone was very upset. F
Mrs. Merino was heart-broken.
Poor
All the sheep in the other paddocks
were gloomy— 44 You'l I never get her
back al i ve," they said.
Then Leicester spoke
"Just leave it to me, I will
go and bring her back."
Everyone scoffed at him.

But, late that night, when every-
one was fast asleep, Leicester
crept off to rescue Mollie.
Because he was black, it was
very hard to see him in the dark.

When he reached the Dingoes' camp
his heart sank.
Mollie was shut in a little yard
quite near the two Dingoes who
were sitting in front of a fire.
They were licking their lips and
talking about a lovely meal they
were going to have.

He tip-toed up to the yard, unlocked
the gate and walked in.
Poor Mo II i e was terrified. He
whispered to her to hide behind him
and they crept out without a sound.
When they were past the camp
they raced home.




Mrs. Merino was overjoyed, and
everyone was delighted to see
Mollie again. They all thought
Leicester was a hero!
All the sheep in the paddocks
near by gathered round to say
how wonderful he was.

Mrs. Merino gave a lovely party
for him and all the little lambs
for miles round were invited.
They all danced round Leicester
and sang "For He's a Jolly Good
Fel low," played games and had a
wonderfu I ti me.
The only trouble was

They all wanted to sit next
to Leicester at tea!
