FUNCTION
Provide for a comprehensive assessment of Australias water resources and for
the extension of water resources measurement and research; promote
collaboration between agencies concerned. Foster standardisation in hydrology.


Preface
The six State Governments of Australia ate responsible for the control and conservation of
water withintheir own areas. The area under State control amounts Gottrn'
a total area of the mainland and Tasmania of 2,971,100 square miles The Commonwealth Gover
mpn t jc rpsnonsible for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. It also na
interests i/water measurement and conservation through its responsibilities for M
oltmical flood warning and research services, the development of special areas (Snowy Mountains
Hydro-Electric Authority) and the accumulation of knowledge on basic national resources.
To meet their responsibilities the State and Commonwealth Governments and local govern-
ment authorities have established organisations whose functionsi
and assessment of surface and underground water resources The results of r n q ervation and
assessments, which are used in the investigation, design and consttruction o
development projects, have not previously been collated officially on a national scale.
To achieve a high degree of national (and international) collaboration in water resources mea-
surement and research the Australian Water Resources Council was established m late 1962 by agree-
the Commonwealth and all State Governments. The Council consists of Commonwealth
and State Ministers (for membership see opposite) with interests in water resources and is serviced
by a Standing Committee of officers aided by technical committees on surface and underground wate
and a number of special working groups.
The principal objective of the Water Resources Council is "the provision of a comprehensive
assessment on a continuing basis of Australia’s water resources and the extension o> me^ t
research so that future planning can be carried out on a sound and scientific basis . Edition
the resources of waters in rivers and underground, a comprehensive as ff ssme^ r^^ ld A i oroue h
account precipitation and the various ways in which water is lost, such as by evaporation. A thorough
assessment^f s water resources involves a knowledge of the several purposes for which water is used
and the current and future level of demand for water supplies.
Australia’s limited water resources will have considerable influence on the country’s growth
and future development. The longer-term objectives of the Council include the definition of areas
where water resources offer the greatest potential for population growth and areas where madequat
water Sources may require the introduction of special measures to provide opportunities for
development.
It is as a first stage in the fulfilment of these objectives that the Council presents this review
of Australia’s stream flow and underground water resources.

Status of Existing Knowledge
Underground water supplies have played an important part ir. the"““^££*s^

(i) lack of personnel trained in the specialised field of groundwater hydro °gy>
fit deficiencies in legislation, in thaf those involved in the development of under-

«i 0 of the fact that although underground water can

(iv) lack o P f appreciation of the ease with which large supplies of underground water
could be developed in some places. •
Lack of data and deficiencies in the quality of existing data particularly on
basis - which is the context of this Review - makes it impossible to present a complete, comprehen
sive or accurate assessment of Australia’s underground water resources.
Assessment of Resources
For the purpose of this Review it has been found convenient to subdivide the rocks in whici
underground water may occur into three mam groups . . i
t. Unconsolidated Sediments alluvial, aeolian, coastal and lacustrine unconsohda
2. Politicks (water found mainly ,n pores of sedimentary rocks) - sandstones.
3 Fracture? Rocks '(water S found mainly in fractures, joints, solution cavities, and
weathered zones) — igneous, metamorphic and deformed sedimentary rocks.
the tables the qualities are arranged in the following five groups based on
total dissolved solids expressed in parts per million:
0 to 1,000
1.000 to 3,000
3.000 to 7,000
7.000 to 14,000
above 14,000
In some areas the ranee of water quality for a particular rock group extends beyond the l^its
S:saStt rtawsh: eisjs sxsazm
to be grown.


Unconsolidated Sediments
The most important unconsolidated sediments as far as underground water is concerned con-
sists of alluvial and aeolian (wind blown) deposits of Cainozoic age, although in some areas uncon-
solidated material of Mesozoic age may be present. The alluvial deposits occur mainly in small
basins, river valleys, and deltas, and the aeolian deposits are mainly built up as dunes and heathlands
along certain parts of the coast and in the central part of Australia, e.g. Simpson Desert.
In the past the unconsolidated sediments have frequently been overlooked and under-emphasised
as a major source of water. r
Generally the fractured and porous rock groups can be thought of as providing the most
widespread occurrences of underground water, and the principal source of supplies for stock water-
ing. On the other hand, although the known productive area of unconsolidated sediments is small,
there is little doubt that they will be the most important source in terms of quantity and will probably
be the only really important source for irrigation and, in some places, for town and industry supply.
The unconsolidated sediments of the Burdekin Delta in Queensland, which covers an area of some 200
square miies, provide about 200,000 acre feet per annum. This is greater than the estimated long-term
yield of the Queensland part of the Great Artesian Basin, which covers an area of some 430,000 square
miles.
Along the eastern fringe of Australia the alluvium of both eastward and westward draining
streams has considerable potential for intensive development for underground water sources.
In addition to river alluvium, aeolian sands, mainly along the coastal fringe, are known to
contain useful underground water supplies. Despite the generally low content of total dissolved
solids in water from these sands, the water sometimes presents corrosion problems because of its
acidity. Nevertheless the sands generally yield good supplies. The two main areas are in New South
Wales the Tomago Beds near Newcastle and the Botany Beds near Sydney, where the combined
yield is upwards of 25 million gallons per day.
Yields from unconsolidated sediments in excess of 10,000 gallons per hour are quite common,
but in the better areas up to 40,000 gallons per hour may be obtained from a single 8 inch screened
bore. Supplies of upwards of 100,000 gallons per hour are being obtained from large diameter
screened bores.
The quality of water in unconsolidated sediments varies considerably. Large areas of these
sediments overlie part of the Great Artesian Basin and are known to contain water of very poor
quality. In the eastern areas the quality is generally better, and is usually suitable for irrigation of
most crops.
Tables E and 12(b) to 19(b) summarise available information on the extent of unconsolidated
sediments, and the occurrence of underground water in this material. The following comments are
made on special features in each State.
Although there is information on the availability of water for only 15,000 square miles of the
total mapped area of 190,600 square miles of unconsolidated sediments in Queensland, this material
comprises the most important source of underground water for irrigation purposes. Some idea of the
importance of this source can be gained from the fact that in 1962/63 some 113,000 acres were irrigated
from groundwater, almost all of which would be drawn from unconsolidated sediments. In the same
period some 96,000 acres were irrigated from surface water sources.
Well known areas where groundwater from unconsolidated sediments has been extensively
developed for irrigation purposes include the Burdekin Delta, Mackay area, Callide Valley, Bunda-
berg area, and the Lockyer Valley.
Commonly, individual supplies are at least 10,000 gallons per hour with some yields in excess
of 100,000 gallons per hour. Depths are less than 100 feet and quality is generally suitable for irriga-
tion of most crops grown in the State.
Unconsolidated sediments containing groundwater are mapped over only 10% of the area of
the Northern Territory. Over half of the known area (5.4% of the total area) occurs in the arid
inland region where the unconsolidated sediments are a valuable source of water for townships and
irrigation schemes. The sediments occur as river alluvium, or piedmont and evaporite deposits often
overlying impermeable soft or hard bedrock. Water supplies are variable up to 10,000 gallons per
hour from depths less than 100 feet. Water quality is also variable. The townships of Tennant
Creek and Alice Springs (until recently) have depended on water supplies from unconsolidated
material.
The unconsolidated sediments along the coastal plains are mostly unexplored for groundwater,
but some work shows highly saline water associated with low lying coastal plains. Development of
supplies is difficult because of extremely fine uniform sand.
In overall potential, alluvium is probably the most important underground water source in
New South Wales. It is most certainly the major source of underground supplies sufficient in
quantity and suitable in quality for irrigation development.
The sand and gravel beds in the valleys of inland rivers have a far greater potential than in
the coastal rivers of New South Wales with the possible exception of the Hunter, which is more
intensively developed by way of underground water use than any other river valley in the State.. In
the Lachlan Valley, investigations have revealed alluvium to depths of over 400 feet and yields in
excess of 50,000 gallons per hour have been obtained from screened bores.
Aeolian sands along the coastal strip, in the form of dunes and sandy heathlands, constitute a
source of large quantities of shallow, good quality underground supplies as yet largely undeveloped
except for the Tomago beds near Newcastle and the Botany sand beds of Sydney. A safe rate of extrac-
tion for such areas is usually of the order of half a million gallons per day per square mile.
The known areas of alluvium possessing potential for high yield, good quality water supplies
are of the order of 10,000 square miles, or 30% of the total area of New South Wales, and coastal
sands are of the order of 960 square miles.
Sand lenses in the alluvial fill of the valleys in the north-east of Victoria and the channel
deposits of ancestral streams in the Northern Plains provide an irregularly distributed source of water
which is suitable for domestic and irrigation purposes. Barnawartha, Bright, Chiltern, and Wangaratta
are supplied from these. Aeolianites along the coast in the south-west and on the Nepean Peninsula
yield supplies suitable for irrigation. r

NOTES; Supplies available are generally small operating bores yielding useful stock and
domestic supplies. Water for eleven town supplies and for farming and pastoral
purposes, is utilised in approximately 240,000 square miles, but dry bores are
scattered through this area.
Quality is variable, from 1,000 p.p.m. to greater than 14,000 p.p.m. Lack of salinity
information prevents further subdivision according to water quality.

111. Tasmanian
The dominating features of the physiography of Tasmania are the “Obtains ° f * e
south-western areas and the Central Plateau, which ranges in elevation from 3,000 to 4,000
foot From these slopes a large number of rivers flow to the sea. The major part of the Centra
Plateau* is‘drained ti?he Ltlfby the Derwent River. Most of the north-east coast is drained by
the South and North Esk rivers which join at Launceston to form the Tama .
Runoff follows the rainfall pattern and melting snow, with most of the flow occurring e-
tween May and November. Summer flows are low, but except for a few streams along the
coast and in the Midlands most streams are perennial.
IV. Murray-Darling
T He Tht
dfainiy divide of the system. The headwater tributaries in this region form a fairly close dendritic
network and have cut deeply into the old plateau surface of the divide.
The north-western boundary of the drainage system is difficult to define., For these purpose
it is the boundary of the Bulloo-Bancannia Drainage Division. South of the Murray River in west-
ern Victoria a large area is drained by the Wimmera, Avon and Avoca Rivers. This area is virtually
a region of internfl drainage, and the rivers empty into extensive and ephemeral salt lakes.
A most unusual, but characteristic feature of the Murray system is the very low gradient of
the valley below the relatively short and steep fall from the headwaters of the area. For mstanc
Cecil Plains on the Condamine River, an upper tributary of the Murray, in Queensland is less than
1,200 feet above sea level, but is 2,170 river miles from the mouth of the system in South Austra .
V. South Australian Gulf
The short streams of the Adelaide area ate seasonal, occasionally ceasing to flow in the sum-
mer The two mo important streams, the Torrens and the Onkaparinga. have cut narrow gorges
Across The MournLofty' uplift and enter St. Vincent Gulf. The upper teaches of the streams show
fairly mature characteristics. There are only a few small streams on the shores of Spencer Gul .
VI. South-West Coast
Many rivers particularly the larger ones, have wide low gradient valleys in their upper reaches
relatively steep young valleys as they approach and pass through the Darling Scarp, and return to
low gradient valleys fs they cross the coastal plain between the Darling Scarp and the coast.

m Xost Tof the rtream flow occurs during and the majority of streams cease to
flow in summer.


VII. Indian Ocean
The river basins are generally very large and almost featureless. The river beds are wide and
have flat gradients.
Stream flow is intermittent and irregular and is characterized by long periods with no flow
and short periods of severe flooding. In the north virtually all stream flow occurs in summer while
in the south most stream flow occurs in the winter. The more southerly streams are saline.
VIII. Timor Sea
Relief is dominated by the dissected northern margin of the Australian Shield (Western
Plateau). As only the fringes of the Shield lie in the pluvial zone, extensive river erosion is re-
stricted to these fringes. Dissection of this northern margin has produced a topography charac-
terized by ridges and tablelands that stretch from the Kimberleys to Arnhem Land. In this dis-
sected region are to be found the headwaters of all the major rivers that drain northward to the
Timor Sea.
Most rivers in the Northern Territory finally drain to the sea across extensive estuarine plains.
Some rivers pass through large areas of alluvial flood plain in their middle courses. A large tidal
range results in the penetration of sea water many miles inland, in some cases to as much as sixty
miles. . .
The monsoonal nature of the climate with very high intensities of rainfall in the rainfall
season which starts in December and lasts from three to five months, results in rapid runoff. The
lower reaches of rivers are often flooded. The majority of the rivers cease to flow in the long dry
season of seven to nine months and divide into reaches, water holes or billabongs.
IX. Gulf of Carpentaria
The majority of the rivers flow only during the summer monsoon season. However, the
Nicholson and Gregory Rivers, which are fed from large springs from the Darkly Tableland and
some of the rivers of northern Cape York Peninsula which have their flow replenished from ground-
water sources, are perennial.
The rivers in their upper courses have normal tributaries incised into the uplands, some to a
depth of as much as 500 feet. At an average distance of about 100 miles from the coast they enter
a monotonously flat coastal belt, with a fall of not more than a foot to a mile, and develop numerous
anabranches and distributaries which discharge into neighbouring rivers. These form a complicated
network of channels which may render approach to the coast from the landward side quite impos-
sble.
In the tidal salt-flats certain of the rivers form true deltas with meanders abundantly de-
veloped. The whole drainage type has evidently evolved in response to monsoonal conditions and
heavy summer flooding in rivers flowing over low, flat plains towards a gulf in which the tide may
rise to 18 feet and more.
X. Lake Eyre
The rivers of this division rise in areas of low and erratic rainfall, averaging 10 to 15 inches
annually and flow towards the most arid portion of the continent where annual evaporation is 100
inches or more. During Pleistocene times these rivers carried great quantities of water, but now the
valleys are heavily alluviated and occupied by shrunken streams which flow only in times of heavy
rains.
A few streams rise in the western Mac Donnell Ranges, and later unite to form the Finke,
which flows to the southeast. The Todd, Hale, Plenty, Mac Donnell and Field, which rise in or near
the eastern Mac Donnell Ranges, all disappear between sandridges in the Simpson Desert.
In the north-eastern part of the division, mainly in western Queensland, the Cooper, Diaman-
tina, Georgina and Mulligan Rivers carry very variable summer runoff. Although rainfall in their
catchment is generally widespread, heavy falls sometimes occur. For instance, Cooper’s Creek which
has no flow most of the time discharged nearly 10,000,000 ac. ft. at Birdsville in 1954/55. In their
lower reaches these rivers have an average fall of only a few inches to the mile and each diverges into
a system of interlacing channels so that during flood periods the inundated area may be upwards of
40 miles wide. This natural but irregular and unpredictable irrigation system produces a luxuriant
but short-lived growth of feed.
Long, ribbon-like watcrholes in these seldom-flowing streams or on minor tributaries form
permanent natural reservoirs up to 20 miles or more in length.
Very occasionally these rivers reach Lake Eyre, carrying great loads of sediment.
XI. Bulloo-Bancannia
The Grey Range in Queensland marks the structural divide between the Murray-Darling
and Lake Eyre divisions and although the slope of this area is toward the Murray-Darling, the water
in the streams reach it only in times of exceedingly high flood. The region is one of virtually inter-
nal drainage.
XII Western Plateau
The rivers, where they exist, ate seldom long and carry water only after local storms.
Two areas in this region should be mentioned separately, the Desert Basin of Western Aus-
tralia and the Nullarbor Plain, both marginal depressions underlain by artesian basins and both po-
ssessing a seaward slope. The absence of surface water in the Desert Basin is probably due to the
abundance of blown sand and the porous nature of the underlying aquifer, rather than to the low rain-
fall. Surface water is also absent on the Nullarbor Plain which, in addition to receiving low rainfall,
is underlain by Tertiary limestone, and the drainage derived from rainfall and from intermittent
streams in the north is entirely conveyed in underground passages and issues as springs at the base
of the coastal cliffs.


APPENDIX 3
NOTES ON AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL AND EVAPORATION
The mean circulation pattern of the earth’s atmosphere is such that anticyclones (high pres-
sure systems, with their associated descending air currents, clear skies and lack of rainfall) predom-
inate over the Australian continent. The mean path of these anticyclones is over or to the south of
southern Australia during the hotter months. In this period the south-east trade winds become estab-
lished over much of northern Australia, being interrupted in the extreme north by incursions of air
flowing from the north-west (sometimes referred to as the north-west monsoon) or by the formation
of tropical cyclones. During winter the anticyclones dominate the central section of the continent
and westerly wind streams affect Tasmania and southern sections of the mainland.
Because of its insular geographical position and lower latitudes Australia does not experience
the extreme "cold waves” of Northern Hemisphere continental land masses, and the summer climate
of much of the Australian mainland is hot and arid.
Distribution of Rainfall*
Condensation of atmospheric moisture to produce rainfall in significant amounts requires
lifting and consequent cooling of large masses of air. As the greater part of the Australian main-
land fs low in elevation and lacks marked physical relief, the necessary lifting of air masses must bc
provided by atmospheric processes which are irregular in their occurrences and intensity. Rainfall
displays a corresponding irregularity in both space and time.
The heaviest reliable rainfalls occur in regions where marked mountain barriers are in close
proximity to the coastline—the eastern and southern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, western
Tasmania and the southwest corner of Western Australia.
The southern limit of the southeast trades lies at about 30° south latitude over eastern Aus-
tralia, and some of the heaviest rains of the Australian continent are precipitated along the Pacific
slopes to the north of that latitude, the varying quantities being more or less regulated by the di
ferences in elevation of the shores and of the chain of mountains from near the N.S.W. northern
border to Thursday Island, upon which the moisture laden winds blow. The converse effect l
exemplified on the north-west coast of Western Australia, where the prevailing winds during he
cooler months blow from the interior of the continent instead of from the ocean and result in the
lightest coastal rain in Australia.
The westerly winds which skirt the southern shores are responsible for the reliable, generally
light to moderate rains enjoyed by the south-western portion of Western Australia, the agncultura
areas of South Australia, and a great part of Victoria and Tasmania.
In general rainfall over the Australian continent north of 25° latitude is concentrated in the
warmer months of the year. Over much of the south-east quarter of the continent the distribution
becomes more uniform throughout the year, but with a trend towards greatest depths during the
colder months (when the westerly wind streams are most active) on moving to Victoria and Tas
mania. Concentration of rainfall in the colder months is also observed over the south-west corner
of the continent.
Measurement and Variability of Rainfall
Approximately 7,000 daily read rainfall measurement stations have been established through-
out Australia and neighbouring Territories. The average length of record at these stations is ap-
proximately 50 years.
The density of the rainfall station network differs throughout Australia and depends upon:
• the availability of observers within a geographical region or river drainage system
• nature and degree of economic development within a region
• requirement for measurement of rainfall for research purposes or special technical studies.
The majority of rainfall measurement stations are operated by co-operative observers as an
honorary public service.
Rainfall displays marked variability in time and, in many regions, in space. Droughts and
floods are a familiar part of the Australian scene. This variability necessitates rainfall measurement
totlatively Cperiods (50 years or more) and at a large number of places to enable the rainfall
experience of a river catchment or region to be described with reasonable confidence.
Generalisation of Rainfall Observations
Observations of daily rainfall must be summarised to compare two or more senes of obser-
factor if agricultural prospects or stream flow variability are of interest.
. "Rainfall" can b. I.k.n lo m..n lh. R0an.!...!.. maa.or. of all forma of praoipi.a.ion expr. s »d a. of rain in man,
contexts.


The median, or middle value when the observations are arranged in order by size is usually
better than the average value as a basis for comparisons between stations where a series of observa-
tions contains one or two values much larger than the remainder.
Rainfall Data for Selected Stations
Rainfall data for selected stations in each of the twelve Australian drainage divisions are given
in the attached Table (1) and Map 1.
For each of the selected stations the Table gives the monthly and annual rainfall depths (in
inches) which have been:
(i) equalled or exceeded in 50% of the years of record, i.e. the median;
(ii) equalled or exceeded in 10% of the years of record;
(iii) equalled or exceeded in 90% of the years of record.
The range between corresponding values of (ii) and (iii) and the departure of each of these
values from (i), the median value, provide a measure of the temporal variability of rainfall at each
station.
Data for one month have been analysed independently of those for other months, and there
is no direct relationship between the figures across any row of Table (1). For example, if 31.0
inches of rain occurred at Tully (Division 1) in January, it does not follow that 28.6 inches would
be expected to occur in February of the same year. Moreover the sum of the monthly medians does
not give the median value of the annual rainfalls.
The simple generalisations presented in this review are not suitable for many specialist tech-
nical studies. These often require advanced statistical analyses. High speed computers now facilitate
such analyses of the very large volume of Australian rainfall data.
Measurement of Evaporation
Evaporation measurement is not as simple as rainfall. The official observing network is re-
stricted to about 100 evaporation tanks of the standard Australian design, a tank 3 feet in diameter
and 3 feet deep, mounted in a 4 foot diameter outer tank and sunk into the ground.
Generalisation of Evaporation Observations
Within the same region tank evaporation observations are less variable than rainfall and areal
generalisation of evaporation observations have been made in maps prepared by the Bureau of
Meteorology. Mean monthly and annual evaporation for the selected rainfall stations of Table (1)
have been estimated from these maps and are shown in Table (2) and Map 1. These tank evapora-
tion estimates do not represent the actual evaporation from most land surfaces as in most areas the
actual rainfall is less than the free water evaporation from a tank. The estimates may, however, be
used as a basis for estimating evaporation from water surfaces or plant water use, but the relation-
ships between these quantities and tank evaporation are normally complex and vary from one clim-
atic regime to another.
