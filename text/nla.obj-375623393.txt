NATIONAL ANTHEM,
Dr. John Bull
God save our gracious Queen,
Long live our noble Queen,
God save the Queen :
Send her victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us :
God save the Queen !
Thy choicest gifts in store
On her be pleased to pour;
Long may she reign !
May she defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the Queen.


GLEE, . . . . . . . . . . . . J. E. Stevens
Blow, blow, thou winter wind,
Thou art not so unkind
As man’s ingratitude;
Thy tooth is not so keen—
Because thou art not seen,
Although thy breath be rude.
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky!
Thou dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot;
Though thou the waters warp,
Thy sting is not so sharp
As friend remember’d not.
Shakspeare.
RECIT. & AIR, ... Me. WINN, . . . , J. L. Hatton
EECITATIYE.
Mourn we for women—mourn for children slain,
By treach’rous foes, for cruelty, for gain ;
For gallant men, who oft have bravely fought,
And led the traitors who their lives have sought.
O’er Delhi’s proud and lofty tow’rs
We saw the flag of green,
It flutter’d over scenes of blood,
Where tyranny had been.
Where Nadir* drew his glitt’ring sword,
To sheathe it not again,
Until a hundred thousand lives
By his command were slain.
Those days have pass’d ; —Now Mutineers,
Successful for a time,
Have stain’d, at Delhi, India’s page,
With many a fearful crime.
The British Lion then was rous’d,
He sought the tiger’s lair,
And those who smote in fancied pow’r,
Soon trembled in despair.
Nadir Shah, the usurper of Persia, captured Delhi in 1738.
4


Then came the storm of shot and shell,
In vain the rebels fight;
Those who escape the traitor’s doom,
Are sav’d by coward flight.
Then loud arose the victor shout,
It rang from shore to shore, —
That Britain conquer’d once again,
That Delhi’s reign was o’er.
J. Duff.
EECIT. & AIR, . . . Mb. LOCKEY, ..... Hobhs
RECITATIVE.
Nina! oh, that a thousand tongues were mine
To tell the teeming earth, the sea, the sky,
The breezes, echoes, the wide wandering air,
My joy !—my ecstacy ! that thou art mine !
Like yon bright orb, that thro’ the vaulted heav’n,
In gentlest purity, doth nightly move,
I saw thee—to the world’s rude gazes giv’n—
A thing of loveliness, and light, and love.
In dread suspense, I saw around thee kneeling,
Won by thy charms, the young, the gay, the vain,
Yet fear’d to breathe the deep impassion’d feeling
That grew to frenzy in my tortur’d brain.
I watch’d thy steps, with heart o’ercharged to breaking :
I saw thee still hold on thy way unmoved !
I met thy gaze ! —and, from a dream awaking,
A wild hope whisper’d me, that I was lov’d !
As the poor bird, on instant pinion soaring,
Cleaves the glad air, when from the hand set free,
In one full gush its song of rapture pouring,
So sprang—so soar’d —Nina, my heart to thee.


SONG, . . - Mr. J. L. HATTON, J. L. Hatton.
THE CHRISTMAS SLEIGH-RIDE.
In North America, sleighing is the common mode of transit from one place to another. As the vehicle glides almost
noiselessly through the snow, bells are attached to the harness, and give warning of the approach of the sleigh.
Merrily, merrily sound the bells,
As o’er the ground we roll,
When the snow-drift breaks in silv’ry flakes,
Beside our cariole.
When wrapp’d in buffaloes, soft and warm,
With mantle and tippet tight,
We cheerily cleave the fleecy storm,
Or skim in the cold moonlight.
Merrily, &c.
Merrily, merrily sound the bells
Upon the wind without,
When the wine is mull’d and the waffle cull’d,
And the song is pass’d about.
When rosy lips and dimpled cheeks
The welcome jest inspire,
And mirth in many a bright eye speaks
Around the hickory fire.
Merrily, &c.
FOUR-PART
SONG ;
Maying,” . . . . Muller.
Spring’s delights are now returning,
Blooming flowers scent the vale,
And within her leafy bower
Plaintive sings the nightingale.
Lovely nature seems rejoicing
In her gay and bright new dress ;
Every shepherd swain grows bolder,
Gentler every shepherdess.
Winter drear will overtake us,
Spring’s delights be past and gone ;
Soon our youth in age will vanish,
And our little life be done ;
Come, then, sweetest, fairest, dearest,
Lose no time by saying no;
To the meadows green inviting
Let us all a-Maying go.
From the German .


DUET, . . • Messrs. LOCKEY & WINN, .. . . Braham.
Oh, Albion ! on thy fertile plains,
Tho’ cruel war around thee reigns,
See gentle peace prevailing ;
While on the waves that guard thy coast
Thy British Navy, Albion’s boast,
Spite of each foe is sailing.
Long may the yellow harvest glad thy happy land ;
Long may the wooden walls repel each hostile band ;
While on the waves that guard thy coast
The British Navy, Albion’s boast,
Spite of each foe is sailing.
BALLAD, .... Mr. YOUNG, . . . • J. L. Hatton.
The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking,
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf,
And I from thee my leave am taking,
With bliss too brief.
How sinks my heart with fond alarms,
The tear is hiding in mine eye,
For time doth thrust me from thine arms ;
Good-bye, sweetheart! good-bye.
The sun is up, the lark is soaring,
Loud swells the song of chanticleer ;
The lev’ret bounds o’er earth’s soft flooring,
Yet I am here.
For, since night’s gems from heav’n did fade,
And morn to floral lips doth hie,
I could not leave thee, though I said
“ Good-bye, sweetheart! good-bye.”
SONG Me. J. L. HATTON, . . . J.L. Hatton.
Tom the Tinker’s a wonderful man
At clouting a kettle, a pot, or a pan ;
At a rivet, a trivet, a cup, or a can,
He’s a clipper, is Tom the Tinker.
He mends the scissors—he grinds the knives ;
By hook or by crook, a rare trade he drives,
For, what with the farmers and what with their wives,
There’s sure to be “ work for the Tinker.”


63 \
There is n’t a wedding, a feast, or fair,
For ten miles round, but Tom is there ;
And many’s the pheasant and many’s the hare,
That’s “ pick’d up” by the way, by the Tinker.
He’s known in the ring, the country through—
He has thrash’d the smith, and the keeper too —
And cool’d the courage of more than a few
Who boasted —“ they’d lick the Tinker.”
At the buttery-hatch, when it’s growing dark,
If you hear a squeal, and the maids cry “ hark !
For the noise has made the house-dog bark, —
Ten to one, but it’s Tom the Tinker.
When he tells the tapster “ a quart” to fill,
If he froths it up, it’s—“ Hold hard, Will!
A little more shirt, and a little less frill,
If you please—it’s for Tom the Tinker.”
The lawyer, of late, has miss’d some hay ;
And Tom and his donkey are “ out of the way.”
If you ask “ who stole it ? ’’—why—l can’t say —
You’d better ask Tom the Tinker.
Yet, I’ll bet who likes, an even pound,
That Tom ’ll “ turn up,” as time comes round;
For he knows right well—as we all have found—
There’s no doing without the Tinker.
Guglielmi.
GLEE,
Here’s a health to all good lasses,
Pledge it merrily, fill your glasses,
Let a bumper toast go round;
May they live a life of pleasure,
Without mixture, without measure,
For with them true joys are found.
