M3SSS
OF THE
Aborigines’ protection Association.
a '7*) S'' 2
At the close of another year’s labour, the Council of your Associ-
ation desires to place before you some record of work accomplished
and attempted in connection with the endeavour to uplift and
bless some of the remnants of the scattered tribes of the Abor-
igines of the colony, as well as to state the necessities of the
future. The council would in the first place recognise the faith-
fulness and grace of God in sustaining their hands in the work
and enabling them through many difficulties to maintain the work
in full and vigorous operation. Much material progress has been
made at each of the stations, and the labor of a large number of
the Aborigines has been utilized in reproductive work.
The subjoined manager’s reports will convey some idea of the
progress made at each station, while we shall in this report take
a general survey of the whole work.
It is due to the Aborigines Protectorate Board which was
appointed by the Government, and in whom is vested the control
of the vote for Aborigines, as passed by the Parliament year by
year, to acknowledge their uniform kindness and consideration in
dealing with the needs of the Association. The Association was
placed in a different position last year in relation to the Govern
ment funds, through the recommendation of the Board. In lieu
of the arrangement, hitherto existing of granting the Association
a subsidy of £2 to £1 upon all private subscriptions, the Board
arranged to receive and recommend for payment from the vote,
all accounts in providing for the temporal welfare of the residents
of the stations, incurred with due regard to economy by the
Association. The work of the Association would have been con-
siderably hampered, had the previous arrangement still existed,
as the private subscriptions received during the year
were not sufficient to have enabled the Council to secure
a sum adequate to the needs of the work. It must be
here observed however that while this new arrangement has
proved of considerable benefit in carrying out the work of the
Association, it should not be taken by the Christian public as a
reason for the withdrawal of their contributions to the funds of
the Association. The necessity for help is as great as ever.
prsafa Sr


EVANGELISATION.
Subscriptions to enable the council to fulfil its mission, “to seek
to lead the Aborigines to the knowledge of Christ Jesus as their
Saviour,” are especially needed. The Government grants are not
furnished with a view to the accomplishment of this end, and
therefore private benevolence and philanthropy must be forth-
coming if such object is to be attained. It is most desirable that
the manager of each station should be the evangelist of a large
district surrounding such station and by periodical visitation of
the camps and settlements, obtain a knowledge of the actual re-
quirements of the aborigines ; seek to induce the attendance at
school of all the children of school age; as well as to bring the
people under the influence of the Gospel of the grace of God. In
this way a much larger number would be brought under the scope
of the operations of the Association, and in some measure
effectively dealt with. The sphere of the Association has prac-
tically been limited in the past to the few hundreds gathered to
the stations, while the remaining thousands have been left almost
entirely destitute of religious and moral training, as the operations
of the Board have been confined to the supply of rations and
other temporal necessities.
LEGISLATION.
The great difficulty in the way of much real and effective
work in the endeavour to uplift the race morally
and to communicate spiritual truth to them, has
been the lack of ample and proper legislation to guard the people
against the deception of the base and dissolute whites, and also to
protect them against their own helplessness. The Council deplore
the fact, that those interested in the race did not seek to secure
beneficial legislation on their behalf long years since, so that that
which is a crying disgrace to us as a people, might have been
avoided. It is, therefore, with much satisfaction, that your
Council note the fact that Sir Henry Parkes has been charged by
the Cabinet with the duty of an exhaustive enquiry into the con-
ditions and needs of the aborigines, with a view to the ameliora-
tion of their deplorable condition, and to make adequate provision
to remedy the existing state of affairs. Your Council, have the
gratification of knowing that this action is, to some extent, due
to their persistent efforts, and the kindly offices of Mr. J. F.
Cullen, M.L.A., who presided at our last annual meeting, and has
since devoted time to the preparation of a Draft Bill, which he
has submitted to the Premier.
CHILDBEN.
While fully seized with the importance of rendering assistance
to the adults, your Council, however, realise that if satisfactory
and permanent results are to be obtained, the main endeavour


must be to deal with the children. It is to be deplored that sfi
few out of the large number of children are attending school.
This is due in some measure to objections raised by whites to the
reception of the aboriginal children at the same school with their
own children, but perhaps more largely to the wandering habits
of the people, and the easy methods of travelling open to them.
That the children are capable of education has been fully demon
strated by the results obtained in the public schools existing on
the three stations of the Association, as well as at Brungle, Wal-
laga Lake, etc.
One matter which is of urgent importance is that provision
should be made by legislation for the immediate removal to suit-
able homes of all orphans and neglected children who are now at-
tached to the camps, and are eyewitnesses of the vice and immor-
ality which prevails at these camps. Further, your Council has
on two former occasions in their annual reports urged the desira-
bility of the establishment of a Training Home for Girls, in which
the half-caste and quadroons especially could be trained for
domestic service. The matter has been urged upon the attention
of the Government, with the sanction and approval of the
Government Board, but as yet no step has been taken in the
direction of the formation of such a home. Again, the question
of the advisability of establishing a training home for lads where
suitable trades could be taught has had the attention of the
Council, but as yet no definite decision has been arrived at on the
subject.
THE COASTAL TRIBES.
The attention of the Council has been given to the necessity
for making more ample provision for the coastal tribes. In con-
sequence of the easy methods of travelling, already adverted to,
numerous blacks, men, women and children may be seen in the
city from time to time. They camp at Moore Park, Bondi, or
La Perouse, and are subjected to the temptations of drink, to
which they easily yield. Then the women are led into vice, and
become easy prey to the vicious whites.
These aborigines object to removal to the inland stations, say-
ing that they are coast blacks.
Many of the men are fond of fishing, and under proper super-
vision could be placed in a position to provide for themselves.
What appears to the Council to be necessary is the formation of
a central station on the South Coast where close proximity to
the suitable fishing grounds would be insured, and also an easy
market secured for the sale of the fish.
As a large number reside on the northern rivers, it would be
desirable to open a mission for these especially on the reserve
already set apart for them on the Clarence.


As will be noted in the managers’ reports, much progress has
been made in the cultivation of the land at Coomeroogunga (late
Maloga), and at Warangesda, while at Brewarinna sheep-farming
on a small scale has been enteied upon.
MANAGERS’ REPORTS FOR 1890.
CUMEROOGUNGA.
In reviewing the work of the past year among these people,
I feel thankful to God for the success that has attended us.
Although not quite so much material improvement has been
done in proportion to the two preceding years (owing in a great
measure to the scarcity of funds to pay labour), we can still
report fairly good progress. With regard to the crops, I have to
report, that in consequence of the grasshoppers, the barley crop
was a failure, and we produced 104 bags wheat and 25 tons hay
off the remainder (viz.: 70 acres.) The trees (1| acres) in the
orchard are growing well, and I hope we will be able to complete
planting this year.
The grass land, on account of so much ringing being done, is
producing much better feed.
The Aborigines, for so short a time the place has been
established, appear to be much attached to the place, and with
but few exceptions, all make it their home.
Thore are 170 names on the roll, with an average population
of 140. The school children numder 56, and I am pleased to
state that the Government have called tenders for enlarging and
improving the school. Although much has been done in the
shape of building and improvements, much still remains to be
done, and at present we stand very much in need of material to
work with, which we trust will soon be forthcoming.
Gifts of left-off cothing would be very acceptable, and friends
forwarding same should address to the Aboriginal Station,
Cumeroogunga, via Echuca, or Moama, “ free by rail.”
GEORGE BELLENGER.
Brewarrina.
Notwithstanding the severe trials through which we have
been called to pass during the past year, we have cause for devout
thankfulness to our God for the strength given us, and the
measure of blessing and prosperity vouchsafed by Him.


Losses in stock and farm produce during the year by flood
were considerable, owing chiefly to our not being provided with
a boat. The wool clip was rather tight in consequence of sheep
being several weeks in water continuously, and the scarcity
of grass afterwards. About 10 per cent of the breeding ewes,
perished, but the lambing of the balance having been good, the
flock has been increased by about 70 per cent.
Our agricultural and gardening operations have been fairly
successful; though sowing and planting were proceeded with very
late in the season, the residents have had a good stock of
vegetables, and a good supply of grain and fodder is now stored
for horses and other stock when required.
Our herd of dairy cows has been increased, and the people,
young and old, are well supplied with milk.
A good stock of rations, and a fairly good one of clothes, have
been supplied throughout the year, and the people appear to be
better satisfied to abide on the station than they had been
previously.
The Sabbath services have been well attended, increased
attention to, and interest in the instructions, being evident.
The most agreeable, as well as the most hopeful part of our
work is with the young people, who are progressing splendidly.
W. R. HARYISON.
Warangbsda.
I have much pleasure in furnishing a report of this station
for the past year.
We have finished the six-wire fence, enclosing a cultivation
paddock of about one hundred and twenty acres. There is still
about fifty acres that would pay for clearing.
We have also fenced in a paddock for the horses.
We have put 40 acres more under cultivation, making in all
70 acres, which produced this season 166 bags of wheat, valued
at about £lO7. This will more than be sufficient for supplying
us with flour for the coming year. Also about thirty tons of hay
valued at £l3O, and about one ton of potatoes valued at £l2.
There would have been much larger returns for wheat and
potatoes, only the grasshoppers destroyed a great deal.
Twenty-two bales of wool has been sent to Sydney, part of
which has not been sold.
There has been about two miles and a half of six-wire fence
erected, valued at £45 per mile.


There has been 15 acres cleared and fallowed ready for
cropping this season.
All the cottages have been whitewashed, and one new cottage
erected, and several new rooms have been added to other cottages.
We have received parcels of clothing from Archdeacon
Gunther, Parramatta; Mrs Debenham, St. Jude’s, Bowral;
Mrs. Selwyn, Christ Church, Newcastle; Miss Hassall, Para-
matta ; Mrs. Kent, Public School, Wallahadah, Quirindi.
About 140 people received benefit from the Mission during
the year.
There have been 4 births, 5 marriages, 1 death.
I cannot close this report without expressing gratitude for
the kind interest taken in the spiritual work of the Mission by
the Rev. E. Eldred, Narrandera, and the Rev. R. G. Nobbs,
Whitton, why kindly conduct service the first Sunday in every
month.
F. W. CLARKE.


LOCAL COMMITTEES.
Important assistance has been rendered to the Council by
the Local Committees of Advice, acting on behalf of the mission
stations at Warangesda and Cumeroogunga respectively. Their
sympathy and advice have been of material help to the managers in
the conduct of these stations. It is purposed to invite several
gentlemen residing near Brewarrina Mission Station to form a
Committee of Advice for that Station.
MEDICAL ATTENDANCE.
The services of Dr. T. Orde-Smith as medical missionary at
Cumeroogunga have been continued during the year, and under
his direction considerable improvement has been effected in the
sanitation of the station. The appointment of a medical officer
for each station is most desirable.
HELP FROM ENGLAND.
The Council are again indebted to Alexander Gordon, Esq.
now resident in England, for’his continued interest in the mission
at Warangesda, and for substantial monetary help. The sum of
£2B 6s. was collected by him from various friends, and forwarded
to our Treasurer.
DIRECTOR OF ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS.
That it is important-that the Government should deal in a
comprehensive and thorough manner with the question of the
protection of the Aborigines remaining in our colony is admitted
on all hands. To do this it is absolutely necessary that a com-
petent and reliable man, with a kind and sympathetic nature, and
withal a man of great discretion and firmness of character, be
appointed as director of aboriginal affairs, and charged with the
proper control of the remainder of this people. The vote for
aborigines should immediately be substantially increased, and
special efforts put forth on behalf of the children.
THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHES.
That it is the duty of the Churches to provide for the spiritual
care of the Aborigines will not be seriously objected to. Yet
withal what, sadly to be confessed, is the fact of the case.
Scarcely any effort is made to reach them with the Gospel mes-
sage, and they are left to perish in their blindness, while all
around open churches tell of active Christian work. Moreover,
the splendid contributions of the highest type of consecration that
have been made to China and other foreign mission lands of late,
in the going forth of gifted young men and women to the service


of Christ amongst the heathen, is evidence that the day of self-
sacrifice is still with us. Yet the heathen at our own door are
left to live and die without the offer of a Saviour’s dying love
being presented to them, while unfortunately they have been
cursed by vicious whites with the presentation of previously
unheard vices. Will not the churches respond to the loud call
for help, and send forth some of their consecrated men and women
to the Lord’s service amongst this people, and also send in their
monetary gifts to enable the work to be sustained in full and
vigorous operation, so that amongst the “ great number which no
man can number,” there may be found many of the Aborigines of
Australia.
