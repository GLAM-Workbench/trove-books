LECTURE ON EDUCATION.
Mr FRIENDS,
When I last addressed you, it was for the pur-
pose of placing before you one of the many views
which might he taken of the functions of a Christian
Church, and, with reference to that view, a statement
of some of the duties devolving upon its members;
amongst the most important of those duties I placed
that of training and educating the Young.
I propose on the present occasion to enter more
fully into this particular portion of our Christian duty,
to shew, by reference to the Legislation of other coun-
tries, the views entertained by Governments and Legis-
latures of the principles upon which the education of
the young should be conducted, to adduce evidence
of the effect produced upon Society by the operation
of the different systems which have been enforced by
Law in other countries, and finally to draw such
inferences from the facts which I shall bring before you
as these may warrant, applying them to the exist-
ing state of things in this Colony.
I approach the subject with diffidence; for though
it is one upon which I have thought long and deep-
ly, and as to which I am to a certain extent entitled
to speak, if it be only for the purpose of giving


the results of my own experience in the training of a
large family of children ; yet I am fearful of impart-
ing to the discussion any appearance of dogmatism,
or of unwillingness to admit the advantages which
O O
may attach to existing systems.
I look upon the question of Education as the most
important which can be brought under the considera-
tion of any Church, or any community; for upon
the decision which may be arrived at, must depend
the character of that Church or community in any
given country. Where the subject has to be considered
by the Legislature, the interests of thousands yet
unborn are to a great extent involved in the deter-
mination, by that Legislature, of the principle which
is to guide the proceedings of those by whom the
education of the youth of that country is to be con-
ducted.
It is this conviction of the vast importance of the
subject, and of its bearing upon the happiness of the
future population of New South Wales, which, while
it impels me to address you, does, at the same
time, induce me to express a hope that no harsh
construction may be placed upon any observation
I may make.
It may appear to some that, in expressing my
opinion of the importance of education, I have used
very hyperbolical expressions, and have attributed to
the present generation a far greater power over the
prospects of its successors than it is entitled to claim;
but a reference to History will shew what enduring


effects have been produced upon the character of
future generations by the training to which the
youth of a rising state were subjected ; and I cannot
imagine that we, who, as Christians, and believers
in Revelation, have such constant evidence before
our eyes of the mode in which the sins of fathers
have been visited on their children, can hesitate for a
moment to admit the importance of the results which
may flow from the tone impressed upon the youth
of New South Wales by the system of mental train-
ing to which it is subjected.
The truth is, that they who think and speak lightly
of the effect of education do so in ignorance of the
meaning of the terms they employ. They confound
Education and Instruction, the whole with one of its
parts. Even in this case, however, they are not justi-
fied in denying the magnitude of the results, for good
or for evil, which the presence or absence of a slight
amount of Instruction may produce.
In order, however, that no mistake may arise in the
minds of my hearers from the prevailing tendency to
treat the two terms, Education and Instruction, as
synonymous, I will commence by defining clearly the
meaning which I attach to each.
Education, then, is the process by which the powers
of the mind, the passions, affections, disposition, habits,
manners, &c., are drawn forth, moulded into form,
and have a specific direction given to them.
This definition agrees with the etymology of the
word, which is derived from the Latin word ?Educere?


to draw forth; and, having this derivation, it embraces in
its meaning the whole process by which man is train-
ed and made fit to perform the duties of his position
in life : it embraces physical, intellectual, and moral
training, and should adapt itself to the various capa-
bilities of those who are subjected to its discipline.
Instruction is, in point of fact, but a portion of Educa-
tion ; it is derived from the word ? instruere,? to
instruct, to provide, to furnish, (as with knowledge
and learning) to teach, to guide, to direct; it de-
scribes the process by which materials are furnished
to the mind, which, when properly educated, arranges,
combines, and brings them into such a state of
assimilation as may enable it to derive nourishment
and strength from them ; but which, when improperly
educated, or left to the operation of its own unas-
sisted powers, is as likely to turn this aliment into poi-
son as into nourishment.
It may be quite possible to instruct a child tho-
roughly in many subjects, to give him all that the
experience of the past has, with reference to these
subjects, enabled us to ascertain, while, the other quali-
ties or portions of his mind, having been left un-
cultivated, he is with respect to them but a child still;
or rather he is in a worse position than a child,
for his animal instincts and passions have developed
with his growth, and he is physically, and perhaps in-
tellectually, a man, while he remains morally a child.
It is not however necessary that I should press these
matters more upon your notice ; you, as Christians,
are well aware of the necessity of training up the


child in the way he should go; you admit the truth
and wisdom of the rule laid down by Moses when
he said to the children of Israel ?thewords which
? I command you this day shall be in thine heart,
and thou shaft teach them diligently to thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and
when thou best down, and when thou risest up.?
\\ ith you it is only a question of the mode in which
you should best perform your duty, and carry out the
general command to train up your children in the
fear and love of God.
In order, then, that you may be in possession of
such information as may enable you to form an
opinion of the relative value of the different systems
which have been devised for the purpose of thus
training up children, I will proceed to lay before
you a brief sketch of the characteristic features of
several of those which have been established in
different parts of the civilized world. For the means
of doing this I am indebted, so far as the different
countries in Europe are concerned, to a work enti-
tled ? The Education of the Poor in England and
Europe,? which was written some years ago by Mr,
Joseph Kaye, who, having been appointed tra-
velling Bachelor to the University of Cambridge,
made use of the opportunity thus afforded to him of
visiting the different countries of Europe, to investigate
the character of the education given to the people of
each, and made public the result of his enquiries in
the Book which I have mentioned, the facts given in


which are well worth the earnest attention and study
of those who take an interest in the great problem of
the u Education of a People .?
The countries to which special reference is mad�
by Mr. Kaye are Switzerland, France, Prussia,
Wurtemburg, Baden, Bavaria, Austria, Holland
and Denmark. I shall not, however, attempt to
give an outline of the system established in each
of these countries, all of whom adopt the princi-
ple that it is the duty of a Government to watch
over the Education of the people ; but I will take
Switzerland, France, Prussia, and Holland, as na-
tions differing most essentially from each other in
manners, habits, and form of Government, and whose
experience, therefore, if concurring in the adoption of
any particular practice, or in the affirmation of any
particular principle, may be taken as a most useful, if
not an infallible guide to ourselves.
I will commence with Switzerland.
This country is divided into 22 independent Cantons,
each of which has the complete and entire control
over all its internal arrangements, and regulates them
according to its own peculiar views. The prevalent
religious belief is different in different Cantons; for
instance, the creed in the Pays de Yaud is Presbyteri-
an, in Lucerne it is almost exclusively Roman Catholic,
in Argovie and Berne it is partly Protestant, partly
Roman Catholic. The Educational systems, there-
fore, as may be supposed, differ from each other in
many points ; there are many, however, in which they


coincide: for instance, throughout the Cantons, with the
exception of Geneva, the Yallais, and the three small
mountain Cantons whose population is very scanty and
scattered, Education is compulsory, that is, all parents
are required by law to send their children to school
from the age of 6 to 14, and in several Cantons the
children are bound to remain till they reach the age
of 16. In some of the manufacturing districts excep-
tions are made, and the children are allowed to enter
the Factories at the age of 11, provided they can ob-
tain a certificate from the Inspector of Schools that
they can read and write. But even then they are
obliged to attend periodically at the School for the pur-
pose of receiving further instruction. In the Can-
ton of Argovie, however, which is one of the princi-
pal manufacturing districts of Switzerland, the chil-
dren are not allowed to enter the Factories till they
have attained the age of 13.
It is to be observed that these Laws are made and
enforced under a form of Government essentially de-
mocratical: the people themselves require the attend-
ance of the children at the Schools ; so conscious are
they of the necessity of Education to the encourage-
ment of temperance, prudence and order, and of the
tendency of mankind to postpone the consideration
of matters which benefit Society at large, to those in
which they may imagine themselves, however errone-
ously, to have a direct personal interest.
In the Cantons of Berne, Yaud, Argovie, Zurich,
Thurgovie, Lucerne, Schaffhausen, where the Law is
enforced most stringently, it may be said with truth


that all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 are
receiving a sound religious education.
O O
The conviction has been forced upon the authorities
throughout Switzerland, that it is hopeless to attempt
to raise the character of the Education of a com-
munity unless the character of the Schoolmaster
stands high, and unless he occupies a proper position
in the community: they have, therefore, instituted
no fewer than 13 Normal Schools for the Instruc-
tion and training of Schoolmasters and Mistresses.
In the majority of these schools the members of the
different religious communities are received indis-
criminately, and the Principals of these Schools state
that no inconvenience has been found to result from
the instruction of different sects in the same School; the
pupils who differ in faith from the Master are allow-
ed to absent themselves from the doctrinal lessons
given in the school, and are inquired to attend one
of their own clergy for the purpose of receiving
from him this doctrinal instruction.
In Fribourg, a Canton governed by Catholic Priests,
Protestants may be found in the Normal Schools, and
are allowed to absent themselves dining the hours of
religious instruction, while in Argo vie, which has
distinguished itself in opposition to the Jesuits of
Lucerne, several of the professors in the Normal
School are Catholics, and the utmost tolerance was
manifested to the Catholics in the Primary Schools.
The Swiss Government recognized this principle,
that Secular Education was necessary to the progress


of religious education ; they saw also that if the
powerful sects in the different Cantons were to refuse
education to the Dissenters, only one part of the
population could be educated; the only mode of secur-
ing both secular and religious education was by li-
berality; they therefore decided that all children should
be required to attend School, and that all the Schools
should be open to the whole population. Experiments
were made in some of the Cantons for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the discipline and training of a
Normal School might not be dispensed with by select-
ing Masters from the Monitors of the Primary Schools,
and in other Cantons the Normal Schools were open
only for portions of the year, during which Lectures
were given to persons wishing to be Schoolmasters ;
but both these experiments have proved to be failures,
and it is now universally admitted that the training and
discipline of a Normal School are essential; the Catho-
lic Priests, and the Protestant Clergy equally agree
that no efforts of their?s could ensure good masters, un-
less they were aided by a sufficiently long religious,
intellectual, and domestic training under the eye of
experienced and trusty Professors.
All agree that three years is absolutely necessary
for the training of a master, and that the candidate,
before entering the Normal School, should have com-
pleted his education at the Primary School: all, or
nearly all, agree also that a system of manual labour
is a necessary part of the educational scheme at a
Normal School.
As a general rule, all the Pupils work for 2 hours


daily in the garden attached to the School. In fact
in these Normal Schools, the greatest possible atten-
tion is paid to the formation of the character, and
every precaution is taken to guard against the possi-
bility of a man of low character or poor education
obtaining the situation of a Schoolmaster ; such a Mas-
ter being worse than none at all. No Teacher there-
lore is allowed to take charge of a School until he has
obtained from the Council of the Canton, whose duty
it is to examine candidates, a diploma stating his
capability of directing the education of a School ;
he must also obtain a certificate of character from the
Director of the Normal School in which he was
educated; and in many cases another from a Clergy-
man of his own sect, stating his capability of conducting
the religious instruction of children. With regard
to the Primary Schools, each Canton is divided into
a certain number of communes, (Parishes or dis-
tricts) and each of these is required by law to furnish
sufficient School room for the education of the child-
ren, and to provide a certain salary and a house for
the master, whom it receives from the Normal School
of the Canton. These communal schools are generally
conducted by masters chosen from among the most
numerous religious sect in the commune, unless there
are sufficient numbers of the different religious bodies
to require more than one School ; in this case one is
conducted by a master of one sect, and the other by a
master chosen from a different sect.
The children who differ in religion from the master
of the school are permitted to absent themselves from


the doctrinal lessons, but are required to obtain
instruction in the doctrines of their own Church from
Clergy of their own persuasion. The education given
to the children in the Communal or Parochial Schools
includes :
1, Religious Instruction; 2, Reading; 3, Writing;
4, Linear drawing; 5, Orthography and Grammar ;
6, Arithmetic and Book-keeping; 7, Singing; 8, The
Elements of Geography ; 9, History of Switzerland ;
10, Elements of Natural Philosophy with its prac-
tical applications; 11, Exercises in composition;
12, Instructions in the rights and duties of a Citizen,
The Education given in the Normal School at
Zurich comprises, 1, Religious Instruction; 2, Mode of
communicating Religious Instruction; 3, German Lan-
guage; 4, Elocution; 5, French Language; 6, Geogra-
phy; 7, History; B,Arithmetic; 9, Geometry; 10, Na-
tural History; 11, Natural Philosophy; 12, Pedagogy;
13, Writing and Drawing; 14, Geometrical drawing;
15, Vocal Music; 16, Gymnastics.
Each Canton has a Board of Inspectors presided
over by the Minister of Public Instruction : it is the
duty of the Board to visit all the Schools in the Canton,
at least once in the year, and to report on each
individually to the Government: the report embraces
the state of the school itself, the progress of the Pupils,
the character of the Instruction given by the master,
and the attendance of the children of the commune
or Parish: in addition, however, to the system of
General Inspection, each commune has a local Board,

elected annually from the Clergy and educated men,
the members of which visit the schools, and report
individually of the children; and great stress is very
properly laid upon this combined system of general
and local Inspection. The following table will shew
the proportion which the children attending school
boar to the population in the different Cantons of
Switzerland.
FRANCE.
It was for a long time a matter of debate in France
how the difficulties arising from the religious differ-
ences of the population should be overcome ; whether
separate schools should be established for all the differ-
ent religious bodies ; whether the schools should be
thrown open to the whole population without distinc-
tion, no attempt being made to communicate religious
instruction of any kind ; or whether the schools should
be thrown open to all, but the management entrusted
to a master chosen from the most numerous sect in the


Department or commune of which it was either the
Normal or the Primary school. It was felt that if the
first course was adopted, the education of many chil-
dren would be left unprovided for, as there would be
several places where there might not be a sufficient
number of children of some one sect to justify the
establishment of a separate school. ;
It was felt that if the second alternative was adopt-
ed, the most important part of education would be
either wholly neglected, or at least most indifferently
provided for; that to deny the master the right of
giving practical religious instruction in the school was
in effect to deprive him of the most powerful means
of improving the character of his Pupils.
The third alternative was therefore adopted; and the
Normal Schools in the different Departments, and the
Primary Schools in the different communes or Parishes
were placed under the management of teachers
selected from the most numerous Christian sect in the
Department or commune in which the school was
situated.
It was further arranged that the Parents who differ-
ed in religion from the Master or Director of the school,
should have the power of requiring their children to
absent themselves during the periods of religious in-
struction ; but it was enacted that it should bo necessary
for such Parents to provide elsewhere for the religious
education of their children. In all the enactments
on the subject of education in France, the Religious
education of the people is constantly referred to as
being of the most momentous importance.


The specific arrangements which have been in force
for some years for the education of the French people
may be briefly detailed as follows;
Each Department is obliged, either by itself or in
conjunction with another Department, to support a
Normal School for the instruction of Schoolmasters.
The course of training pursued in these schools
comprehends
Ist. Moral and Religious instructions.
2d. Reading.
3d. Arithmetic.
4 th. Grammar.
sth. Linear drawing, Surveying, and other appli-
cations of practical Geometry.
6th. The Elements of the Physical Sciences.
7 th. Music.
Bth. The Elements of Geography and History.
9th. The grafting and pruning of Trees.
No candidate is admitted into a Normal school un-
der the age of 16, and every candidate must produce
certificates of good character, and exhibit proof that he
is not subject to any physical ailment or infirmity in-
compatible with the exercise of his duty as school-
master ; he must also pass an examination before a
committee, and prove to the satisfaction of the mem-
bers that he is able to read and write correctly, that he
has a knowledge of the rudiments of Grammar and
Arithmetic, and that he has a satisfactory acquaintance
with the principles of the religion which he professes.
The Normal school admits members of all religions;


all dogmatical instruction is avoided in the general
lessons; the pupil teachers receive this instruction from
clergy of their own Church, at times set apart for this
purpose; and until a pupil teacher has received a
certificate from a minister of his own church of his
proficiency in the doctrines of his own religion, he
cannot officiate as master in any school.
Each commune or Parish is obliged by Law to sup-
port, either alone or in conjunction with one or more
neighbouring communes, at least one elementary Pri-
mary school; but where the population is sufficiently
numerous, it is invited to support one or more schools
for Boys, and one or more for Girls; and when the
number of the different sects is sufficient, the Minister
of Public Instruction is authorized to grant permis-
sion to the commune to establish separate Schools
for the separate sects.
The chief Towns, and those communes whose popu-
lation exceeds 6,000 are required to support a superior
Primary School, or a Grammar School; the education
in these Schools is of a higher kind than that in the
Elementary Primary Schools.
The Instruction in these latter comprehends :
Moral and Religious Instruction.
Reading.
Writing.
Elements of Arithmetic.
Elements of French language.
System of weights and measures.
Geography (particularly of France.)


History (particularly of France.)
Linear drawing.
Singing.
There are two local Committees appointed, and the
children in each school are subjected to an examina-
tion twice every year in presence of the Members
of these Committees : in addition to this, there is
a system of general Inspection by an official In-
spector appointed for each Department, who makes
his Report to the Minister of Public Instruction;
this report embraces,
Ist, The state of the School house and classes.
2d, The moral character of the school.
3d, The Instructions given, and the methods fol-
lowed by the Schoolmaster.
The Inspectors are directed to pay particular
attention to the condition of the Normal Schools
in their several Departments.
The management of the Normal Schools is vested
in the Minister of Public Instruction ; but they are
maintained at the cost of the Department. The
expenses of the Inspector are defrayed from the
General Revenue.
A Fund is created in each Department for the relief
of old and superannuated Masters, and for that of the
Widows and Children of Masters who die in their
calling : the Masters pay 5 per cent, of their income
to this Fund : means are taken to induce the Mas-
ters to distinguish themselves, and medals are given
to those who do so. In the examinations which take place


in the Primary Schools the pupils are classified in
order of merit, and the list showing this order is
suspended in the school until the next examination.
The efforts of masters and pupils are thus stimulated,
as they feel that others from without are watching
their progress.
PRUSSIA.
The system of education now in operation in Prus-
sia has existed in a more or less perfect state since
1819. The effect produced by twelve years adminis-
tration of the Law passed in that year may be ascer-
tained from the report made by Mr. Cousin in 1831.
From this it would appear that the number of
children between the ages of 7 and 14 being 2,048,030,
the number attending school was 2,021,421 ?so
that very few of the children between the ages men-
tioned were absent from school ; the fair inference from
the comparison of the numbers feeing that all or nearly
all the children between the ages of 7 and 14 attend
school regularly.
In Prussia, as in France and in Switzerland, the
Department of Public Instruction is thought to be
of sufficient importance to be under the charge of a
special Minister, who has the central direction of a
great system which, composed as it is, of local associa-
tions, and grounded on local efforts, spreads its rami-
fications through the whole territory, embracing the
least as well as the greatest, the poorest as well as
the richest, the most distant as well as the nearest
districts of the kingdom.


In order to understand the Educational machi-
nery, an outline of the Territorial system must first be
given. Prussia is divided into 10 Provinces ; these
Provinces are sub-divided into Departments, the De-
partments into Cantons, the Cantons into Communes ;
each Commune is obliged by Law to support at least
one Primary School, the management of which is
intrusted to a local committee, of which the Priest
or Clergyman is ex-oflficio member.
In addition to this system of local Inspection, there
is an Inspector who resides at the chief Town of the
Canton, and who examines and reports upon all the
schools of the Canton ; while in each Department there
is a special Councillor deputed by the minister of
Public Instruction, who is a member of the Depart-
mental Council.
The Law in Prussia ordains that all parents or
guardians should send their children or wards to
school, or provide a good education for them in some
other manner; and the children are to remain at
school from their 7th to their 14th year. Children may
enter the school before 7, but they cannot leave be-
fore they attain the age of 14 without the permission
of the Committee. The Schoolmaster is bound to keep
proper returns of the attendance of the children, and
these are submitted every fortnight to the inspection of
the local committees, who will compare them with the
list of the children who ought to attend school ; and
should they discover that any have absented themselves,
will enquire into the causes of non-attendance.


The only excuses which are admissible, (except the
proof that the education of the children is otherwise
provided for) are certificates of illness, the absence of
Parents, or the want of decent clothes. The first step
taken by the authorities when they find that children
do not attend school is to remonstrate with the Parents
or Masters; if these remonstrances do not produce
sufficient effect, more rigorous proceedings are adopt-
ed, and punishments are inflicted.
The Law having thus defined the duty of individu-
als to send their children to school, proceeds to enact
that every commune must maintain a Primary school,
and that every town whose population exceeds 1,500
must maintain a superior school. In the rural districts
two or more communes may unite to'maintain a pri-
mary school, on condition that the villages are not
separated more than 2|- miles from the school in a
level country, and 1)- miles in a mountainous country,
and that there are no insurmountable natural obstacles,
such as rivers or torrents, between the village and the
school.
When there are differences of religion among the
children, the master of the school will belong to the
religion of the majority; but, when possible a second
master will be provided, whose religion will be that
of the minority.
The Law defines the minimum salary to be paid to
the schoolmaster, but urges upon the school commit-
tees and school societies to make these salaries as much
higher as they are able to do ; it also provides for the


maintenance of the schoolmasters or mistresses when
they become old or infirm.
It insists upon the proper selection of a site for the
school-house; that it should be well built, kept in good
condition, and well warmed; that it should have a gar-
den attached to it, in which the children might be in-
structed in the kind of cultivation practised in the
commune; that it should have a play ground; that it
should have proper furniture, books, &c.
Poor children, whose Parents are not able to pay
the school rate, have instruction given to them gratui-
tously.
The Funds required for the maintenance of the
schools are provided for by a rate upon the house-holders
of the commune. The rate assumes the form of an
Income Tax, and is levied on all heads of families.
If there are two schools belonging to different sects,
the Parents contribute only to that school which their
children attend.
In addition to the rate, the Parents of the children
who send them to school pay a small fee to the school-
master, which serves as an encouragement to his exer-
tions.
The ruling feature and fundamental character of
the Prussian Law of education is a moral and religi-
ous one; although the different Christian sects are often
obliged to attend the same school, the religious educa-
cation is not the less attended to. The Law provides
that in a school intended for several Christian sects,
there shall be masters who shall direct the religious


education of the children of their respective sects; that
when the locality is too poor to support more than
one master, the Parents who differ from the school-
master in religious belief shall be obliged to pro-
vide for the religious education of their children out
of school.
The labour of the day always commences and ends
with a short prayer, and a few religious observations;
and the master is warned not to let this degenerate into
a mere matter of routine.
The Instruction in the Primary School embraces
1. Religious Instruction.
2. German language.
3. Elements of Geometry and linear
drawing.
4. Mental and Practical Arithmetic.
5. The Elements of the Physical sciences?
of Geography, of History, especially
of Prussia.
6. Singing.
7. Writing.
8. Gymnastic Exercises.
9. Manual labour, and Instruction in the
agriculture peculiar to the locality.
The education in the superior Primary Schools,
embraces
1. Religious and Moral Instruction.
2. The German language, reading, com-
position, and the study of the Chef
d?tEuvres of German literature.


3. The Latin language.
4. Elements of Mathematics.
5. The Physical Sciences, so far as to ex-
plain the principal phenomena of
nature.
6. Geography and History together, so
as to give the young men a know-
ledge of the world, the different races
of mankind and the different Em-
pires into which the civilized world
is divided.
7. Drawing.
8. Writing.
9. Singing.
o o
10. Gymnastic Exercises.
Separate Schools when possible are provided for
girls.
These arrangements for the education of the popula-
tion would manifestly be inoperative, were not pro-
vision made for the proper training of the teachers
and masters; and to the enactments with reference
to this I must now request your particular attention.
In the first place the Law says that in order that a
master may be enabled to fulfil the duties of his
station he ought to be religious, wise, and alive to the
high importance of his profession ; he ought thorough-
ly to understand the duties of his station, to have
acquired the art of teaching and managing youth,
to be firm in his fidelity to the state, conscientious
in the discharge of his duties, friendly and prudent


in his relations with the Parents of his children,
and with his fellow citizens in general; finally, he
ought to inspire all around him with a lively interest
in the progress of the school, and to render them
favourably inclined to second his own wishes and
endeavours.
In order to secure the education of such Masters,
the Law ordains that each Department should contain
a Normal school subject to the following conditions.
No Normal School is to admit more than 70 pupil
teachers: when the Protestants and Catholics in a De-
partment are nearly equal in numbers, there shall be, if
possible, a Normal School for each sect; but when this
cannot be managed, then the masters for the Primary
Schools of the less numerous sect shall be procured
from the Normal Schools of adjoining Departments.
Normal Schools for the simultaneous education of two
sects shall be permitted only when the pupil teachers
can obtain close at hand suitable Religious Instruction,
each in the doctrines of his own church.
No young man is to be received into a Normal
School who has not gone through a course of Instruc-
tion in an Elementary Primary School. There must
not be the least ground of suspicion as to his moral
character; and he must not be less than 16 nor more
than 18 years of age.
Primary Schools are to be attached to all Normal
Schools, in order that Pupil teachers may be practised
in the art of teaching.


The course of Instruction in a Normal School is
to last three years.
Particular Funds are set apart for the support of
those Pupil teachers who are not able to pay for
themselves ; but every pupil who receives such assist-
ance is obliged, at the end of his course, to accept the
place which may be offered to him by the authorities.
No young man is allowed to conduct a Primary
School until ho has obtained a certificate of his capabi-
lity to fulfil the important duties of a Schoolmaster.
Having given a brief sketch of the laws regulat-
ing the education of the people in those countries of
Europe whose political positions are contrasted with
each other in the most marked manner, but whose
systems of Education coincide in every essential parti-
cular, I will now lay before you an outline of the
educational regime of Holland, which differs in many
respects from those of France, Prussia, or Switzerland,
but the results of which are as highly spoken of by
those who have visited the country.
Mr. Nicholls, in his report upon the condition of
the labouring Poor in Holland and Belgium, says ;
nothing can exceed the cleanliness, personal propriety,
and apparent comfort of the people of Holland. I
did not see a house or fence out of repair, or a garden
that was not carefully cultivated. I met no ragged
or dirty persons, nor any dranken man. I saw only two
beggars, &o.
This, among other causes, is due, to the care with
which the Government has provided for the social


improvement of the people, by securing to them a
good Education.
Holland was the first among the European nations
which recognized the truth that an uncivilized and
degraded peasant is always more wretched than one
whose tastes have been raised by a religious, moral
and intellectual education ; and she has the greater
honour of being the first to throw off the shackles of
uncharitable and unchristian sectarianism, and to
assort, and to act on the assertion, that the grounds of
agreement of all Christian sects are infinitely and
immeasurably more important than their grounds of
difference.
A brief sketch will be sufficient to explain how
these principles have been carried out in practice.
The population of Holland, which amounts to about
2,600,000, is divided in pretty equal proportion
between the Catholic, Lutheran and Protestants of
the reformed Calvinistic Church. The law of 1806
proclaims as the great end of all instruction, the
exercise of all the social and Christian virtues; but
while in France, Switzerland, and Prussia, the children
who differ from the religion of the master are allowed
to absent themselves from the school during the hours
of religious instruction, in Holland, the masters are
required to give religious instruction to all the children,
and to avoid, most carefully, touching upon any of the
grounds of controversy between the different sects.
In the schools, the moral and religious instruc-
tion is taken from the pages of Holy Writ, and the
whole course of education is mingled with frequent


reference to the general evidences of Revelation; the
great principles and truths of Christianity on which
all are agreed are carefully inculcated; but those
points which are the subject of religious controv crsy
form no part of the instruction of the school.
Education again is not compulsory in Holland;
but the influence of the Inspectors of Schools, of the
Clergy, and the general conviction of the advantages
of education, is sufficient to bring to the schools in
some places one-sixth, and generally one-eighth of
the population.
These results have been obtained slowly, and that which
has most contributed to them has been the excellence
of the schools, the talents of the masters, and, above all,
the respect and honour which the masters have gradually
attained by the honourable and independent position
in which they have been placed by the Government.
The Schoolmasters in Holland are supported in
respectability and comfort; for though the law has not
fixed a minimum salary, only stating that the munici-
pal authorities shall secure a sufficient income for the
teachers, and that they shall not be left dependant
upon the payment from the parents of the scholars, yet
the general influence exercised upon the population,
and upon the local authorities, has been quite sufficient
to place them in their present position of comfort and
respectability.
Holland, after trying a variety of methods to secure
a sufficient supply of masters, was compelled in 1816
to introduce Normal Schools for the education of pupil


teachers ; and the general principles upon which these
are conducted are the same as those upon which the
Normal schools of France, Prussia and Switzerland
are established.
As Holland has provided a more comfortable sub-
sistence for her schoolmasters than other countries
have done, fewer of them relinquish their profession,
and in consequence fewer Normal schools are required
for their education. It has been found generally to
be bad economy to stint the pay of the schoolmasters ;
the worse they are paid, the shorter time will they
remain at their posts.
In fact, the various arrangements connected with the
working of the educational system in Holland appear
to have produced the best results. These, it is true,
may be partly owing to the sober, steady, practical
character of the people ; but, at all events, the system
in operation has been carefully adapted to the character
and habits of the people, and on that account is the more
likely to operate beneficially.
Having given an outline of the Educational sys-
tems adopted in Europe, I will turn to the other side
of the Atlantic, and give a brief sketch of the scheme
which our American brethren have adopted.
There is a general resemblance pervading the Edu-
cational systems of the different states of the union;
though there are, of course, local peculiarities depend-
ent upon the character of the inhabitants; to these,
however, it is unnecessary that I should allude ; and
by taking the state of Massachusets, and that of New
1 ork, as affording types of the American educational


system, I think I shall give you a correct representa-
tion of the leading features which distinguish it from
those of the diffex?ent countries to which I have before
directed your attention.
As early as the year 1642, the General court of the
Colony of Massachusets enjoined upon the local autho-
rities the duty of seeing that every child within their
jurisdiction was educated.
In 1647 a law was made that every town contain-
ing 50 householders should maintain a school, and
O '
teach, gratuitously, every child who came to it to read
and write ; and that every town of one hundred House-
holders should maintain a Grammar school.
At present Massachusets is divided into 314 Town-
ships and Cities, each of which is hound to maintain one
or more schools, to which all children residing within
their boundaries shall have free admission.
Wherever there are 500 families, a higher school
must ho kept for the use of all, in which History,
Algebra, Geometry, and, if the Inhabitants are 4,000
in number, Latin, Greek, Rhetoric, and Logic shall be
taught.
The number of schools in 1848 was 3,748, or one
for every 240 inhabitants; the average attendance was
126,000 in summer, and 143,000 in winter, and the
number of teachers 8,163, of whom 5,737 were females;
the population amounted to 866,000; therefore in
summer about one person in every seven attends
school regularly, and the proportion is increased
in winter to one in six.


Each Township is bound by law to raise, by assess-
ment, for the payment of instruction only, at least
one Dollar for each person between the ages of four and
sixteen; but this amount is in practice greatly exceeded,
some Townships raising'as much as ten, and none less
than two Dollar?s for each person between these ages;
the average was in 1848, 3 Dollars, 87 cents, or about
16s. Sterling. As the number of children between
these ages is very nearly one-fourth of the whole popu-
lation, every person was taxed about a Dollar annually
for the support of free schools.
In the State of New York an appropriation was
made by the legislature in 1795 for the establishment
of common schools ; in 1805, and subsequently, steps
were taken, by appropriating a certain amount of Land,
and of Bank shares, to raise a School Fund, and addi-
tions have been subsequently made to the stock of this
fund, the annual proceeds of which now amount to
about 300,000 Dollars. In 1849 the common Schools
of the state were declared to be free ; they were ordered
to be kept open for 8 months in the year, and each
district was to levy twice as much upon itself as it
received from the state Fund.
As the amount of the School Fund was 300,000
Dollars, the rate upon the school districts would be
600,000 Dollars, making a total of 900,000 Dollars
to be expended upon the education of the children of
a State containing a population of upwards of 3 mil-
lions ; in 1847 the number of children on the books
of the different schools amounted to 775,723, or about


25 per cent, of the whole population, but the average
attendance was not, of course, nearly equal to this; in
the City of New York 100,000 children were on the
books of the schools, while the average attendance did
not exceed 32,000.
?In the States of Connecticut, Vermont, Rhode Is-
land, New Hampshire, and Maine, large School Funds
having been created, the schools are nearly free ; in
Indiana and Wisconsin, provision has been made for
schools which are open to all alike ; practically, there-
fore, the people in the United States have testified their
sense of the value of education by making legal provi-
sion for the maintenance of schools. Until lately, how-
ever, little attention had been paid to the training of
teachers ; for though the subject had been pressed upon
the notice of the Governments of different States, yet
no effort had been made to establish proper training or
Normal Schools. In 1839, however, the State of Massa-
chusets, which appears to have always been foremost
in promoting schemes which tend to the moral and
intellectual education of the people, established 3
Normal Schools : in 1850 similar Schools had been
established in the States of New York, Pennsylvania,
Connecticut, and Michigan, while one has been estab-
lished in Upper Canada, and another in New Bruns-
wick.
The circumstance that, in the different States of
the American Union, the Schools arc free to all, the
whole expense being defrayed by the State, either by
appropriation from the general revenue, or by
local assessments rendered compulsory by Law, has led


to the adoption of a system of Education of a purely
secular character. In the Primary Schools, indeed in all
Schools established by Law, the master is not allowed
to introduce religion into his system of teaching ; he
cannot inculcate the motives to moral conduct which
religion holds out.
Although the importance of religious instruction
is admitted by all, the difficulties which the mul-
tiplicity of sects or denominations has thrown in the
way of communicating such instruction has led to its
abandonment, and to an attempt to supplement the
deficiencies of the Primary Schools by the aid of the
Sunday Schools ; upon this subject I shall have more to
say to you hereafter.
In England, for many years, the education of the
children was, theoretically, placed in the hands of the
Clergyman of the Parish, he having charge of the
Parochial School ; but the re-arrangement of the
population consequent upon the development of the
manufacturing system, broke up, practically, the
parochial system in many of the Towns, while the
alienation of those who dissented from the forms or
faith of the Established Church, made it a matter of
necessity that some scheme should be devised by which
the deficiencies of the parochial system might bo
supplemented as regarded the members of the Church
of England, while means should be afforded to those
who dissented from that Church of educating their
children in their own faith, and according to their
own forms.


This has been done by the appointment of a Com-
mittee of the Privy Council, in whose hands a large
sum is annually placed by the legislature, to be dis-
tributed among the schools, generally, throughout the
kingdom, in accordance with regulations framed by
the committee, which are applicable alike to all sects
and denominations, and which are subjected to the
revision of Parliament; in fact, in England, the State
gives aid indifferently, to all who choose to comply with
those requirements as to the construction of schools,
and the inspection of the children by properly qua-
lified persons, the sole object of which is to secure
the proper application of the Funds granted by
Parliament.
The management of the schools is left in the hands
of those who are interested in them, and the most
entire freedom of action is guaranteed to the promoters
and supporters of the different schools.
In Ireland the case is different. There, owing to the
mixture of a Roman Catholic and a Protestant popu-
lation, it was deemed advisable to attempt some sys-
tem of compromise, by which the children of mem-
bers of the different Churches might meet upon some
common ground ; each conceding something to the
other, for the sake of the advantage to be gained
for their children in the public school common to both.
For this purpose a set of School Books has been
prepared under the joint superintendence of members
of the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches,
and a selection has been made of portions of the Holy


Scriptures which the children read, and in which they
are instructed ; while all such portions of the Scrip-
tures as bear upon disputed points are not touched
upon in the school, hut are left to the teaching of
the parents, or religious instructors of the children.
I have given you an outline of the different
modes in which the Governments of other countries
have dealt with this most important question ; I will
now proceed to analyse these, for the purpose of bring-
ing before you, in a compendious form, the result of
the experience of these countries, which, differing as
they do in Government, language, habits, in fact, in
every thing which constitutes national character, will
yet be found, when considering the question of edu-
cation, to he entirely in accord upon many points;
and as to these, therefore, it would be wise on our
parts to take them as our guides.
In the first place, all these countries have acknow-
ledged, by the very fact of legislating on the sub-
ject, the paramount importance of education, and
the necessity of adopting some means, more or less
stringent, of pressing this importance upon the mass
of the people.
All have acknowledged that it would be most unwise
to leave a matter of such importance dependent upon
the voluntary efforts of the people, a large majority
of whom are, from the very want of education, inca-
pable of appreciating the character or extent of the
benefits which it confers.


All have acknowledged the absolute necessity of
providing in some special manner for the education
of those to whom the task of training the children
of the people is intrusted.
It has been agreed upon by all that the only prac-
tical mode of carrying out a proper system of train-
ing Schoolmasters is by the establishment of Normal
Schools, in which not only arc all the subjects in
which the master has to instruct his pupils thoroughly
taught, but instruction is given in the art of teaching.
All, too, are agreed that in these Normal Schools
the religious education of the teacher should form
a main element in his training ; that whether he be
called upon or not, in his capacity of teacher, to
give instruction in the doctrines of his own church,
it is essential that he should be a religious man, that
he should be actuated in all his doings by those mo-
tives which are enforced by our Saviour and his
apostles, and thus be able to bring the great princi-
ples of Christianity to bear upon the minds and
consciences of the children placed under his charge.
In some of the countries to which I have referred,
education is compulsory; that is, parents are obliged
to show that they have either provided in a satis-
factory manner for the education of their children, or
that they send them to the public school; in other
countries, though not actually compulsory, such pres-
sure is put upon the parents as is sufficient, in most
instances, to induce them to send their children to


school, and to keep them there. In England, and in
the United States, however, it is left to the option of
the parents whether to send their children or not, and
the result in both instances is unsatisfactory; a large
proportion of the children do not attend school, and
those who do, remain there too short a time to derive
much benefit from the instruction afforded to them.
With regard to the character of the instruction to
be given in the Primary Schools, all are agreed that
the great end to be attained is the exercise by the
children of all social and Christian virtues. This object
is followed up in France, Prussia and Switzerland
by making the schools, to a certain extent, auxiliary
to the churches; for although the schools are open to
all sects alike, yet the master, being trained up in the
particular doctrines of the majority of his pupils, is
required to teach these doctrines during certain hours ;
the children who differ from him in religious belief
being allowed to absent themselves from this religi-
ous lesson, which, however, they are bound to receive
from ministers of their own faith. In Holland the
masters are required to give religious instruction to
all the children, but must avoid touching upon any
controversial points.
In England the schools are generally in connec-
tion with some church, and the doctrines and forms
of that church are taught to the children, permission
being given to those who dissent to withdraw them-
selves while special or dogmatic religious instruc-
tion is given to the rest'of the children.


In Ireland, as in Holland, the master is required
to give instruction to all the children in accordance
with the books which are furnished to him; and which
are supposed to contain, if not all which it is de-
sirable that the children should learn, at all events,
nothing to which their parents can have any just
ground of objection.
In the United States of America, though the prin-
ciple is admitted in theory, the mode in which it is
carried out is through the intervention of the Sunday
Schools, which are looked upon as necessary supple-
ments to the Primary Schools, the education given in
these having a purely secular character, though an
attempt is made to inculcate moral conduct and to
enforce it by motives altogether irrespective of religion.
In summing up the results of the experience of
other countries, we may consider these, firstly, with
reference to the objects to be attained, and secondly,
with reference to the means to be employed ; now, the
object to be attained is the education of the people,
giving to that term its proper meaning, which includes
not merely the communication of a certain amount of
knowledge, the result of the mental toil of those who
o /
have preceded us ; but also the inculcation and appli-
cation of certain great principles of action, by which
man is, or ought to be, guided when he seeks to apply
this knowledge to the actual purposes of life.
Now, with the single exception of the United States
of America, we find that in every country, and under
every form of Government, the religious instruction


of the people is stated to be a necessary element of
any system of national education; nay, even in Ameri-
ca, the necessity of religious instruction is admitted,
but it is transferred from the Primary to the Sunday
Schools.
The effect of the two systems may be best placed
before you in the words of those who have been cog-
nizant of their working as evidenced in the appearance
and manners of the people. Mr. Kaye says, with refer-
ence to Switzerland, ? the result is that the traveller is
?astonished and delighted in walking through the
? Towns of the Cantons above mentioned (Berne, Yaud,
? Argo vie, Zurich, Thurgovie, Lucerne and Schaff-
? hausen) to miss those heart rending scenes to be met
? w *th in every English town, where crowds of filthy
?half clothed children are seen in the back streets
?grovelling in the disgusting filth of the undrained
pavement, listening to the lascivious songs of the
?tramping singer, and witnessing scenes calculated
?to demoralize even adults, and certain to leave
? their impress on the susceptible minds of the young,
?who are soon found quarrelling, swearing, fight-
?mg, and in every way emulating the immorality of
?those who bred them : in Switzerland nothing of the
? kind is seen; the children are as regularly engaged
? in school, as their parents are in their daily occu-
? patio ns,?
I am aware that the results exhibited in Switzer-
land are due to the whole system pursued with these
children, not to any particular portion of it; but still


there is the result patent to all; and the system
which has produced that result is one in which great
importance is attached to the religious instruction of
the children.
The following Extract from a Statement made hy
the Reverend Dr. Edson, Rector of St. Anne?s Church,
Lowell, Massachusets, will afford you the means of
judging of the results which have grown out of the
American System. ? I have resided (says Dr. Edson)
11 in Lowell as a Minister of the Episcopal Church for
? twenty-seven years, and during the whole of that
? time have taken an active part in education as a
? member of the School Committee and otherwise.
? Seeing that the system of Schools established by Law
? was the only one possible under the circumstances of
? the country, I have applied myself with all the zeal
?in my power to make it efficient; and I have endea-
? voured to cause the deficiency of religious instruction
? in the Day-Schools to be supplied by encouraging
? Sunday Schools to the utmost of my opportunities :
? to the children of my own flock I have given all the
? doctrinal instruction in my power in the Sunday
? Schools, and by other means; I have interested
? myself generally in favour of Sunday Schools, seeing
? in them the only mode, under our system, to imprint
? upon the minds of those who most require such
? teaching the principles of revealed religion.
u My experience, however, of now nearly thirty
? years, as a Pastor, has, I am sorry to say, forced
11 upon me the painful conviction that our public school


<i system has undermined already among our popu-
? lation, the doctrines and principles of Christianity.
u I perceive also its effects distinctly in the modes
11 of thought and action of the young people who flow
? into Lowell from the neighbouring States. I find,
? in my frequent intercourse with them, that they
? possess a knowledge of none, or nearly none of the
? distinctive principles of the Christian Faith, and
? that many are in a state of mind beyond that of mere
u indifference. I find in them a considerable indiffer-
? ence as to what sect they may belong to, thinking
11 all religions alike, and generally showing a great
? ignorance of the Bible, which they profess to take
? for their guide. I find many not only unable to
u repeat the Ten Commandments, but entirely unaware
u of there being Ten Commandments at all. I find
? them generally well grounded in the ordinary ele-
? ments of what is called common Education ; clever
? and acute as to worldly matters that concern them;
? but very lax in their notions of moral obligation
? and duty, and indisposed io submit to any authority
? or control whatsoever, even from a very early age.
? This is exhibited, among other ways, by the
? irregular manner in which they attend school, whe-
? ther Day-School or Sunday School
? The result of my own experience at Lowell is that
u less than one-half of the children between the ages of
? five and sixteen attend any Sunday School, and that
u those who do attend do so most irregularly. It is easy
( ? to infer what sort of hold the Bible, its precepts and


? doctrines, can be likely to have on minds thus loosely
? prepared for the temptations of life : there is, in the
i( mind of the great majority, no principle of deference
?to authority: very often, also, no point of doctrine
? seems to have been effectually and thoroughly explain-
-11 ed to the children, and taught as from authority ; all
? doctrines seem to have been taught as the deductions
11 ofindividual opinion, and left pretty much to a child?s
? own inferences. The moral effect of this is visible in
? relation to all authority, beginning with the parental.
? It is no new remark that, unless a child is from his
? earliest years taught to reverence an authority higher
? than, and in support of the parental, he will very soon
? begin to question and resist the parental ; that this
? evil is already nearly universally felt and acknowledg-
? ed in this country there is no longer room to doubt.
u From throwing off authority in regard to religious
? matters, and holding doctrines loosely, the step is easy
u to abandoning them altogether; and accordingly it con-
? sists with my observations here, during many years
? past, that the great majority of those now growing up
i( cannot be said to hold more than belongs to mere na-
? tural religion, I look upon this prevalent condition of
? mind with very great apprehension, for all history
? shows that this is only the first downward step to
u complete irreligion and infidelity, and thence to the
? corruption of morals such as was exhibited in the
? heathen world. I much fear that we are making sure
11 and not very slow strides in thatdirection, and while
? I deeply lament it, I am free to confess I see no pre-
� sent remedy for it in this country.?


The opinions above started are but the summary, in
the words of a particular individual, of those enter-
tained by a very large nmraber of observant and calm
judging men in various parts of the United States;
and that such would bus the inevitable result of a
system of education siimilar to that now carried
out in America has oftem been argued upon general
principles.
It would seem, then, that experience, as well as
theory, is opposed to the separation of education into
two distinct elements, secular and religious ; and that
the application, to any people, of a system which treats
these two elements as separate and independent, is
likely to produce the moist injurious effects upon the
national chai?acter,
I wish, however, to draw your attention more par-
ticularly to this portion off the subject, for I am aware
that there are some earnest and zealous advocates for
the extension of education! who have been induced to
press the adoption of tine American system, com-
monly termed the ? Secular system,? upon the
ground of the supposed impossibility of carrying out,
in practice, a system of combined religious and secu-
lar instruction in districts where differences of opinion
on religious matters prevail to the extent which they
do in this Colony.
I believe, however, that no such impossibility does
exist, and I am borne out in the expression of this opi-
nion by the experience of the possibility of such a sys-
tem, as exemplified, more or less clearly, in every one


c f the countries whose Educational systems have been
explained to you, and more especially in Switzerland
and Holland. Even the difficulties which may have to
be encountered are greater in appearance than realhy ,
and in order to overcome them we need only be ac-
tuated by a kindly and charitable appreciation of the
motives of those who differ from us, and a conviction
of the much greater importance of subjects upon
which we, as Christians, are fully agreed, than of those
on which we differ: we must also be deeply impressed
with the importance of the bearing which religion has
upon our present, as well as upon our future existence.
In order to this, we must arrive at a clear and defi-
nite understanding of the meaning of terms, many of
which are too often employed in very different senses
by controversialists, but to which it is our interest to
attach such a precise meaning as may enable us to
enter upon the discussion of the important question
before us with some hope that we may be found to
agree upon all main points. "W hat, then, is Hell
ejious Education ??
Education we have before defined to be the process
by which the powers of the mind, the passions, the
affections, the dispositions, habits, manors, &c., are
drawn out, moulded into form, and have a specific
direction given to them. Religious Education is the
process by which all these qualities and affections are
turned in a proper direction, towards Him who, as our
Father, our Saviour and Redeemer, our Comforter
and Sanctifier, is the highest object of our reverence


and our love. Religious Education does not consist
m the committal to memory of the facts of the Bible
History, or in the statement, and acknowledgment
of the truth of the doctrines taught by any section of
the Christian Church; but it docs consist in the appli-
cation to every action of our lives of the motives of love
to God and to our fellow creatures which are en-
forced by our Saviour and His Apostles, and in press-
ing these motives upon our children upon every suit-
able occasion, and by every means in our power.
The great difference between Secular and Religious
Education is, that in the former the motives which
are pressed upon the attention of children are those
which have solely relation to the present life, and are
applied to that element of our nature which is active
enough, aye, and more than enough, already, namely,
to our selfishness; the-result being the unwholesome
development of the worst features of the character ;
while the latter presses upon the child, motives which
have i eferenoe to the life to come, and which are spe-
cifically opposed to that selfish portion of our nature
which we find it so difficult in practice to combat and
subdue.
The great mistake which lies at the root of the
American, or Secular system of Education, is one
which has its origin in a feeling which is too preva-
lent among ourselves, namely, that religion has little
to do with our daily life, but is to be kept entirely for
Sundays. Now nothing can be more fatal to the life
of religion than such an idea as this.


It is a matter of melancholy experience that when
men are compelled to confirm the truth of what
they say by an oath, the result is not to make them
more cautious and more truthful in their general con-
versation, but, on tho contrary, loss so : they seem to
think that, when not called upon to swear to the truth
of any fact, they may lie with impunity : so also when
religion is made to consist in observances, and these
to have relation to particular days, whether Sundays
or holidays, the effect is not so much to hallow those
days, as to desecrate the rest of the week.
Now the whole tenor of tho Bible teaching is to the
effect that our whole life, on week days as well as on
Sundays, should be spent under an abiding convic-
tion that God is ever present ; that it is our business
to please Him, and to fulfil all righteousness, with a
view to a blessed hereafter.
In point of fact, to use a phrase which I met with
in a Sermon of the late Rev, F. W. Robertson, ? our
? business is our Religion,? in the sense that it should
be conducted with special reference to the obligation*
imposed upon us by the duty we owe to God.
It is this which the Schoolmaster, who is anxious
to do his duty by the children placed under his charge,
should ever have before him as the great result to
which his teaching should tend.
If, then, the rules of the School contradict, theoreti-
cally or practically, this great truth ; if they say that
during the larger portion of the daily life of the child
his relation to God is to be studiously kept out of


sight, what can be the result but that which is plainly
stated by the American Clergyman as applicable to
the children with whom he came in contact, and what
can be the result with reference to the Masters, but
that no really religious man will accept an office by
the rules of which he is prevented from fulfilling the
most important part of his duty ?
The conclusion, then, which I am entitled to draw
from the experience of other countries, so far as this
has reference to the objects which wc should strive to
attain by the adoption of any particular system of
education, is, that this system should embrace all those
faculties of man s nature which can be developed by
proper training; that the physical, intellectual and mo-
ral qualities should all receive their proper cultivation,
and that, as it is impossible to inculcate abstract mo-
-1 al principles, or to build these upon any other than a
religious foundation, the love of God being the only
solid basis for such a superstructure, it is necessary
that attention should be paid to the religious training
of the children in the Day or Primary Schools.
With reference to the means to be employed for the
purpose of perfecting the system of education, the
experience of other countries points out to us, in the
first place, the necessity of some special training, in
order to qualify the Masters to perform their duties
properly.
It is the Schoolmaster who makes the School, and
it consists with my own experience, as well as with
that of all those whom I have consulted, that the effect


produced by the adoption of the best system in any
given School is as nothing when compared with that
produced by the exertions of a really good Master.
A good Schoolmaster under any system will always
have a good School; though of course the same man
will produce greater and better results under one
system than under another. The first, then, and the
most important step to be taken, is that by which the
proper education and training of Masters can be secur-
ed ; and this can only be done by the Establishment of
Normal Schools, in which the candidates for the office
of Schoolmasters must remain under instruction for a
sufficient period, which period we are justified in
believing should not be less than three years. Having
secured good Masters, the next thing to be considered
is the mode by which the children can be made to
derive the greatest amount of benefit from the instruc-
tion which they communicate: here, again, a reference
to the experience of other countries is our best guide;
this serves to corroborate that of which our common
sense would convince us, namely, that no child can
derive much benefit from the instruction and training
of a School unless he is subjected to that training for
a considerable period.
In Switzerland this period extends over six or eight
years, and generally, throughout the Continent of
Europe, the children do not leave School until they
have attained the age of 14 years, while they generally
commence their attendance at School when they are
6 years old.


Whatever may be the absolute length of time
during which it is desirable that a child should attend
School, we may confidently affirm that but little good
can result to a child whose attendance is desultory,
and whose period of training does not extend, as is
very much the case in this Colony, over more than a
few months, or even a year; to dignify the little smat-
tering of information which he may pick up during
that period by the title of education, is an absurdity.
How do wo deal with our own children ? We com-
mence a course of instruction as soon as they can
speak, and we persevere in exacting from them atten-
tion to a regular course of study till they reach man?s
estate. And shall we venture to affirm that the amount
of preparation for the duties of life which absorbs
fourteen or sixteen years in the case of our children,
can, in the case of the poorer man, be compressed into
as many months ? Most certainly we cannot do so :
the same system of progressive instruction, the same
warnings and checks are required by the poor man as
by the rich, the temptations which beset him, though
perhaps different from those which are presented to the
rich, are as numerous and as difficult to resist; and
as we cannot hope to remove the temptations, we
should do our best to strengthen the mind, and to
enable it to resist and overcome them.
The child who has only just attained the power of
reading is in a far more dangerous position than he
who has had his judgment formed, and his principles
strengthened, by a more prolonged course of mental


training. In the case of the child, the appetite has been
stimulated, and the means of Indulging that appetite
have been placed within his reach; but the capacity
to discern between wholesome food and poison is
wanting, and as a general rule the taste for the latter
predominates ; that which panders to the animal part
of man?s nature, to his appetites and lusts, is eager-
ly sought after, while that which enforces the duties
of self-denial, which speaks to the higher part of our
nature, is rejected as nauseous.
Parents, then, who have the best interests of their
children at heart, should not withdraw them from
School under the idea that they may be made to con-
tribute by their earnings towards the expenses of their
maintenance ; as, however, a very great number of
parents are uneducated themselves, and cannot, there-
fore, appreciate the value of a proper mental training
for their children, it becomes a question whether the
Government should not step in to remedy such a state
of things, by laying down such rules as may secure to
the children the full benefit of that instruction which
the State has taken upon itself to supply ; the expe-
rience of most countries is in favour of the exercise by
the State of some power of the kind, and I confess that
I see nothing in the existing state of the Colony which
would lead me to suppose that the people generally
attach to education, properly so called, that degree of
importance which would render the interference of the
Government an impertinence.
I have addressed you hitherto as members of the


Church of ?Christ, as parts of a great body ; let me,
before I conclude, say a few words to you in your in-
dividual capacities, as Parents or Guardians of the
young, of those whose life here and hereafter may be
determined, for good or for evil, by that which is said
or done by yourselves, I have, in the former part of
this lecture, shown how much may bo done by the
Schoolmaster ; but you must recollect that a child?s
mind is always at work, that he is always learning some-
thing; it is much, of course, if, while at School, good
motives and high principles of action are instilled into
his mind by precept and example; but the amount of
good may be very much lessened, and the benefit of
his School training neutralized, if, when in the house
of his parents, the child is exposed to the influence of
an evil example; if those whom he is told at School it
is his duty to reverence and obey, should show them-
selves unworthy of respect, and should place the duty
of the child to themselves in opposition to his duty to
God.
Our Saviour expressly denounces Woo to those by
whom offences come, and he says, emphatically, that it
were bettor that a millstone should lue hanged round
the neck of him who caused a little one, (that is, a
young or an ignorant person) to offend, and that he
were cast into the depth of the sea. Again, in the 18th
Chapter of Genesis, there is a very striking passage
where God says with reference to Abraham, ? I know
? him, that he will command his children, and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way
? of the Lord.?


This God expressly mentions as a reason why He
showed so much favour to Abraham. Let us then,
who are parents or heads of households, recollect
that God is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever,
and that the same conduct which was pleasing to
Him in Abraham is equally so in ourselves.
It is evident that God considers us as answerable to
Him not only for our own conduct, but also, in some
degree, for that of others over whom we can exercise
jurisdiction ; and that we shall not be held fi.ee from
blame in His sight, unless we do everything in em-
power, by our authority and influence, our example
and our prayers, to load our children and our house-
holds to keep the way of the Lord. That this may be
the result of the training of the youth of this Colony
is the earnest hope and prayer of one, who, having
held a high position among you for several years, has
a deep interest in your welfare, and who is fully con-
vinced of the truth and reality of the expression of the
Psalmist, that ?blessed are the people who have the
? Lord for their God.?
