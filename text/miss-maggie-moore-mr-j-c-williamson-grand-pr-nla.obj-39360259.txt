People who go into business by the side
of men who have a large business built
up by constant advertising, and never ad-
vertise to the extent of a shilling, but
depend upon the drippings of the neigh-
bouring sanctuary, are like the boys whe
go to a pigeon-slicoting match and try to
get the bird that get away from the
regular sportsmen. L’ Entr’ Acte is a
good advertising medium.
