THE
LAND LAW OF THE FUTURE.
CHAPTER I.
With your permission I would wish to place before the readers of
the Herald a scheme for the reconstruction of our land system.
Existing arrangements, it is generally admitted, are bad through-
out, and can hardly be changed for the worse.
If we can, by another method, give to every squatter a better
bargain than he has now ; if we can make every selector the undis-
puted owner of Ids grazing right as well as of his purchased land ;
and if we can over and above arrange that many thousands of new
estates, farms, and homesteads shall be thrown open without delay
or difficulty to all able to turn them to honest use, we claim that the
suggestion needs neither preface nor apology.
In submitting such a scheme in detail, our object is mainly to
put forward that which is desirable, and in the abstract, practicable.
The feasibility or popularity of the plan, as the colony is now placed,
it is not necessary to discuss.
Still, it is not unlikely that changes of ? time and tide ? may
drift us some day into unknown waters, ?mid unforeseen perils, where
the rough chart or log of the vagrant pioneer may perchance be found
of use.
With such a possibility in view, the project is laid before those
interested mainly to answer the purpose of a basis for discussion.
Some of the positions taken by the writer may be objected to as
unsound, but they have not been adopted without careful considera-
tion. Meanwhile, such criticism as the scheme may be favoured with
by those competent shall be esteemed an honour, and shall receive
due attention.


The key to our plan is to substitute a freehold grant for all
existing tenures, leaving only that one form of transferable title. A
suggestion to this same effect was published in the Herald of 9th
October last ;* and it is proposed now to pursue the subject in con-
tinuation of the ideas then set forth.
The operation of the existing law, with its various complica-
tions, would need of course to cease, and the steps thereafter to be
taken would be, ?
1. To buy up the squatting-tenure, paying for the same in free-
hold land.
2. To consolidate all station-purchases with the land granted
in payment, resuming all scattered lots, and granting in lieu of the
same an equivalent area suitably situated.
3. To allow every selector who can prove actual present resi-
dence, to acquire, on the law coming into operation, as much country
under a real pre-emptive or other permanent tenure (not a pre-lease,
as at present) as woidd be equal to his grazing right under the Acts
of 18G1 or 1875.
4. The unalienated lands remaining on the resumed runs would
be handed over, in trust, to a local authority for the public behoof,
and meantime they would be open to the permissive grazing of the
lessee?s stock under a half-yearly non-transferable license, subject to
certain provisions, until surveyed and proclaimed open to settle-
ment.
5. Lastly. The most important feature in the scheme strikes
a blow at centralization, evoking the elements of self-government and
propounding the possibility of people managing their own business at
their own doors?the common rule in our old mother country, but a
thing as yet almost unheard of in Australia.
Our course of proceeding would then be as follows :
1, To suspend the further operation of the Occupation and
Alienation Acts, with all rules, regulations, and enactments pertain-
ing to the same.
2. For the purposes of this Act, the country conterminous with
the boundary of the settled districts to be divided into ten territories,
each to be in area about ten thousand square miles, the boundaries to

Henderson, Hunter-street.


be, if possible, coincident with those of existing districts, and, when-
ever practicable, to follow the natural features of the country.
3. The administration of the lands of each territory, under the
authority of this Act, and subject to its provisions, to be vested solely
in a land board, consisting of five members, one of these to be an
official commissioner, and four to be resident civilians, all to be
nominated by the Crown.
4. The Land Boards to meet at such times as they may appoint,
and at such places within their respective territories as they may
determine that Land Courts shall be held.
5. The Courts so constituted to have full power to deal with all
matters coming under the land law ; to exercise summary jurisdic-
tion on complaint of trespass, or in case of abuses of the drove roads ;
further, to carry into effect every other function of government
connected with the administration of land and live stock ; and lastly,
to possess the same penal jurisdiction as Courts of Petty Sessions in
enforcing their decisions.
Appeals against the decision of the Land Courts to lie only at
the first meeting thereafter of the District Assize Court.
6. The Land Board to have power to appoint a surveyor, with
the needful staff for the territory, to act under their orders ; and also,
to appoint Land agents, with suitable offices, at the various places
where Land Courts are appointed to be held ; and all rents and
payments due to the land revenue shall be paid to these land agents,
the funds so received to be applied as directed further on.
7. All surveys, reports, and correspondence relating to the
lands of each territory to be handed over to the Land Board by the
Department in Sydney ; duplicates to be retained.
8. All proceedings of each Land Board shall take place in open
court, and a copy of all proceedings, of whatsoever nature, shall be
entered in full by the land agent or his clerk in a land office book,
to be placed upon the public table of the land office, and to be open
to inspection every week day during office hours. All maps, surveys,
and other documents connected with the business of the Board shall
in like manner be open to inspection.
9. Each Land Board, upon being fully constituted and pro-
vided with a staff suitably equipped, shall procure a feature survey of
the territory, showing all pastoral properties, farms, and homesteads,
in consolidated form, as they are held, known, and worked, specifying


the various lots of purchased or leasehold land comprised in each,
and distinguishing each property by the name under which it is
commonly known. In carrying out this survey, the descriptions of
the runs forming each consolidated station must he referred to and
verified ; but after the completion of the survey, the names of the
stations as they are popularly known shall be used only in public
documents for the furtherance of simplicity and accuracy.
10. The Board shall then call upon the surveyor for a report as
to boundaries within the territory, and when such boundaries con-
flict, overlap, or are defective, full power is given them, after inquiry,
to make new boundaries, and they shall so determine according to the
evidence before them ; and they shall direct the surveyor to mark
the same on the ground and on the plan of survey.
11. A return of reserves within the territory shall then be called
for, and the Board shall deal with the same on their merits, and
according to the following rules :?Reserves from purchase shall be
cancelled ; gold-fields and mineral reserves shall be maintained ;
droving reserves shall be confirmed, and such drove roads as may
cross the territory shall be created permanent reserves of the full
width of existing drove roads ; water reserves and others main-
tained for special objects shall be dealt with according to the dis-
cretion of the board, keeping in view public requirements, and using
their judgment.
In all such dealings with reserves the Board shall give their
reasons fully, and the land agent shall write the same in the Land
Office book, and the surveyor shall be directed to mark clearly on
the ground and on the plan, as early as possible, all reserves created
or maintained.
12. The Land Board shall then procure, through competent
assessors, appointed by them, a return specifying the sales of station
properties within the territory during the five preceding years, stating
description and number of stock, value of improvements, full par-
ticulars of areas of country freehold and leasehold, and price ; and
likewise a separate return of the average price of mixed sheep and
cattle during the month of October (meaning after shearing) in each
of the five preceding years.
13. The documents so procured, the survey plan, and the
assessors? returns, shall be made in triplicate, or in as many copies
as the Board may require, and they shall be exhibited in the land


offices of the territory, and for the term of one month any person
who may consider himself interested in the proposed commutation
shall be at liberty to write in the Land Office book such suggestions,
as he may think fit, signing his name to the same, and such remarks
or suggestions shall be placed on record by the land agent, and shall
be submitted to the Board in due course.
14. At the first sitting of the Land Court, after the expiry of
the month defined in section 13, the land agent shall read aloud a
report, comprising all the information that has been procured from
the survey and assessors? report, and all matters standing on record
in the books having reference to the general commutation about to
take place, but communications as to specific stations or other pro-
perties shall be postponed until each case comes forward separately
for adjudication.
15. The Board shall then proceed, from day to day, and at
such land offices as they may appoint, to deal separately with the
commutation of each station, according to such order as they may
determine.
16. As each case is called on the land agent shall read aloud
from the records of the office, the name of the station, its position
and area, the quantity of purchased land belonging to the same,
number and description of stock, purchased land or conditional
selections held by other owners, and a sketch showing the position,
area, and other features of the run taken from the general survey
shall be laid before the Court.
17. The commissioner, as chairman of the Board, shall then
call upon the assessors, to state the value, as struck from the five
years? average, of a station in the. territory, at so much per head of
sheep or cattle, under schedules A, B, or C, as the case may be
(fully stocked, half stocked, or lightly stocked). On receiving the
assessors? valuation the Board shall verify the same from the
assessors? general report, or they may return the same for amend-
ment, retaining in their own hands full authority finally to determine
the matter, apart from the assessors? valuation. When the Board
use their discretion in this manner, they shall give their reasons
fully in open Court, and the same shall be written fully out by the
land agent in the Land Office book. On the price being so deter-
mined, the same shall be read aloud by the land agent, and shall be
entered as an award of the Court.

Net Area: 227,000 acres.

18. The assessors shall then be called upon to state the average
price of stock?say, sheep and cattle?for the five years comprised in
their general report, and on their valuation being given in, the same
shall be verified as before by the Board. If they exercise their dis-
cretion in altering the amount they shall detail their reasons fully,
as in section 17. The price of the live stock so determined shall
then be announced, and written down by the land agent as an award
of Court.
19. The land agent shall then read aloud, for example:?
South-western territory?Commutation of lease, Candowan Station,
original area 240,000 acres.
Stock: 48,000 sheep over six months, less 3,220 sheep pro
rata for freehold land. Station No. 1, schedule B (or half-stocked),
number of stock to be valued per head, 39,780.
Station, value per head awarded, 285.: sheep, value per head,
Bs. Surplus, being value of leasehold per head, 20s.
20. The Board shall then announce that their award in com-
pensation for the cancellation of Candowan leasehold (19), is the
value of 39,780 sheep, at 20s. per head, being �39,780.
21. The various portions of land purchased by the lessee,
situated in various parts of the run, 23 in number, shall then be
dealt with; the total area being. 17,000 acres. The Board shall
direct that those portions as detailed shall be resumed and the titles
cancelled, and compensation shall be awarded for the same at the
price of 20s. per acre. 23 portions of purchased land, 17,000 acres
at 205., �17,000; the total value in compensation under sections 20
and 21 being �56,780.
22. The Land Board shall then give their award, that the Can-
dowan leasehold, together with the station and purchased lands on
the same, is annulled and resumed, and that compensation be made
to the lessee, by a grant of land of the value of �56,780 at 20s.
per acre, in such position and with such boundaries as may be
determined.


23. The lessee shall then be called upon to elect from which
part of the leasehold, subject to certain conditions, he will take this
grant. These conditions would be?
1. That he relinquishes to the Crown, as represented by the
Land Board, on his own behalf and his heirs and
assigns, all right and interest in the leasehold of Can-
dowan, with purchased lands, dams, wells, and improve-
ments.
2. That he binds himself to enter into no dealings in refer-
ence to these resumed lands (saving and excepting such
arrangements with the Land Board as are authorised
by law), under penalty of confiscation of his grant; and
3. That the grant he takes must form one compact block, in
agreement with the published survey regulations.
24. The lessee having made his election in terms of the Act,
and to the satisfaction of the Board, the boundary shall provision-
ally, subject to survey, be marked on the plan of Candowan run, and
the commissioner shall then give the final award of the Court.
Thus?
The Court awards that the commutation of Candowan station,
as read, is valid and final according to law, and decides that the con-
solidated grant in compensation, to be called Candowan estate, shall
be surveyed as follows: ??? To commence at that point on the Can-
dowan Range, abutting on the Narghil River, forming the south-
western corner of the original Candowan station, as shown in the
territorial map ; to follow the river up easterly for ten miles, and
thence to proceed by a line to be run northerly, and now provision-
ally marked on the plan hereto attached, to a point on the Candowan
Range ; thence following that range to the point of commencement,
to comprise within these boundaries the awarded area of 56,780
acres.
The lands resumed within the original limits of Candowan
Station are now vested in this Land Board under the Act, to be
dealt with in terms of the same.?
24a. The commutation of the lease being thus effected, the plan
showing the arrangement, with a brief summary of the conditions
written on the face of it, shall be signed by the late lessee, the com-
missioner, and the surveyor.


25. The next step will necessarily be dealing with selectors who
have proved their residence. To enable them to acquire their pre-
emptives according to law, and also to avert crowding and confusion,
a permissive clause to the following effect would be wanted:?
? It shall be in the power of the Land Board, on due reason
being shown in Court, to resume any area of conditionally purchased
land, granting the owner in lieu an equal area elsewhere, together
with compensation for cost of removal and other contingent losses
caused by the resumption, the amount to be determined by assess-
ment ; but such compensation to be granted only when lands are
resumed by the Board on public grounds, and not when the exchange
is made at the wish of the applicant in order to obtain advantages
such as greater area of land, or a better position. Notwithstanding,
when a conditional purchaser or selector seeks to make such exchange,
and obtains the consent of the Board to move to an allotment sur-
veyed under this Act, he shall be at liberty to remove all buildings,
improvements, fencing, and other fixtures from his original pur-
chase.?
26. Another clause to prevent trouble from erroneous descrip-
tions or blunders in survey, would be wanted, to this effect?? That
all lands granted shall be taken by the surveyor?s marks as being
more or less the published areas, and that in no case shall bounda-
ries be liable to be moved on the plea of short or over-measurement,
but in such case of error the amount due as purchase money may be
rectified in such manner as the Board may direct when the actual
area is ascertained. In other cases of error, such as a boundary be-
ing run across a road, the Board shall have full power to deal with
the adjustment of the matter in the public interest ; to compel the
removal of a fence by the party in fault, and the re-erection of the
same on the proper line, in terms of the fencing regulations.?
27. With these clauses, the Board would be prepared to deal
with the selectors? applications for their pre-emptives. These, of
course, would be put in at once by all the selectors within the bounds
of the station.
The Board?s decision would be as follows :?? The applications
of (19) conditional purchasers (named) for corresponding pre-emp-
tive areas under section 27 are provisionally accepted, subject to
sections 25 and 26 and the settlement clauses (fencing, residence,


&c.). They shall be further dealt with on receipt of the surveyor?s
report.?
28. The last application would be that handed in by the late
lessee for permission to graze his stock on the resumed country, and
a half-yearly license would be given him hearing a fee at the rate of
10s. per annum per square mile, non-transferable, liable to revocation
on three months? notice being given ; granted subject to the licensee
maintaining in good order all fences, dams, and other improvements
(for which he has been paid in commutation), but giving him an ex-
clusive, though strictly permissive, right to graze. On the abuse or
neglect of the improvements, the Board would be empowered to
cancel the license to the holder, and offer the same at auction, and
further to levy on the stock for cost of repairs.
This would conclude the commutation of the lease of Candowan,
and the country would be left apportioned as follows :
Area of run, Grant to lessee in compensation ... 56,780 acres.
240,000 acres. Selections 13,000 acres
Pre-emptives ... 39,000 ?
52,000 ?
Remaining in trust in the hands of the Land Board
for survey and settlement, temporarily licensed
for grazing, a tract of 131,220 ?
CHAPTER 11.
We have seen the leasehold of Candowan commuted, with the
claims of the lessee and of the selectors satisfied, and an extent of
130,000 acres, or more than half the run, remaining vested in the
Land Board for survey and settlement.
In the meantime the Land Board has granted the late lessee a
license to graze his stock on the resumed country so vested, the
license being non-transferable and revocable at three months? notice.
The questions may now be raised ?? Why buy out the lessee ??
? and, after buying his run, why allow his stock to remain on the
grass ? ?


The answers to these questions involve an enquiry as to what the
squatting right really is which we have bought up. Some authorities
have described it as a merely permissive use of the grass. A
scrutiny into the law and custom on which it is founded will, how-
ever, show that the tenure rests on a very different basis. Originally
founded by the noted Orders in Council in 1846, a species of
property was created, that within the tenor of these Orders, was as
much property as any freehold estate in Sydney, which has since
passed from hand to hand for large sums of money, by virtue of a
right of transfer legally created, and has thus without break come
into the hands of the present owners.
It has been asserted that the Act of 1861 abrogated this lease
hold right. If it did so, it must have extinguished the rights of
the lessees in some intelligible manner; it must have ceased to make
the squattages transferable, and it must have ceased to demand rent
for the runs. The legislation of 1861 did none of these things. It
merely created a new class of tenants, and gave them power to enter
upon these lands, somewhat like the right of entry for game and
minerals reserved in farm leases. Such conditions do not abrogate
farm leases, and no more does the right of selection cancel the
squatting title. Being a legal title and lawfully acquired by pur-
chase, a squattage as such is valid property now.
All legislation since 1861 fully recognises this. The squattages
are regularly transferred like real estates. The complaint is con-
stantly made that the rents are inadequate to the value of the
pasture, and moreover, if the administration of the law with one
hand aids the encroachments of selection, with the other it provides
means for the squatter?s defence. This all shows that by law and
custom, even since 1861, the squattages have been dealt with as real
properties, not as merely permissive grazing rights.
History and daily experience alike show this. The squatting
lease was always and is still a valid transferable title, and this must
be admitted, even though the policy and operation of the tenure may
be condemned as vicious, which it unquestionably is. The title was
at first incautiously created by the Imperial Government, and
through that unfortunate blunder the capital and property of the
country have been arrayed in antagonism to settlement. In like
manner, purely through the transferable quality of the lease, squat-
ting has at length worked into the shape of a corporate interest with


all the banks at its back, defying colonization, wasting the country,
provoking and aggravating the cut-throat strife of selection; and,
finally, holding large tracts of the best of the colony an untenanted
wilderness for the behoof of a purely stock-jobbing and money-
lending interest.
But, at the same time, this system, insufficient and objection-
able as it has proved, has carried on its back the industry and earn-
ings of two generations; and if the higher law?the ? salus populi ?
?requires that the right should be extinguished, it can only be done
through some scheme of equitable compensation. Now, if we look
at real cases, which show the actual rights and wrongs of the ques-
tion, we find that in most instances the price we give for the cancel-
lation of the lease turns out to be simply the repayment of a
premium disbursed by the squatter when entering upon his station,
under a purchase sanctioned in every possible way by our own laws
and customs. This answers the first question.
The second question is, ? Why, after buying the run, should
we let the squatter?s stock remain on the grass ?? In reply, we may
ask, ? What else would you do with the grass, or with the stock ??
If the grass is not eaten, it will burn or rot on the ground, and if the
stock is taken off, where could it be moved to ? We must remember
that what we have bought up is not a mere grazing right, but a lien
on the soil that had become hostile and dangerous to national
interests. If this lien is extinguished the temporary use of the pas-
ture may be allowed with safety and benefit. Such a proceeding as
turning the squatter?s stock off the grass, or forcing them to be
sacrificed, would not be reform, but wanton, idiotic waste of nature?s
gifts, and havoc to our national industry. One thing we must not
lose sight of, apart from the dispute between the squatter and the
public, which is that there is another view of this question that
comes home in an immediate and direct fashion to every man,
woman, and child in New South Wales. Whether retaining the
form of squatting or in another future form, grazing is, and will
remain, the standard industry of Australia. It is rooted in nature
and habit, and from grazing mainly are yielded the wages and rents
of Sydney ; and the hundred streams of wealth that, distributed
among us, place meals on our tables, and support our many valuable
institutions.
This industrial structure, incomplete as it is, is worth preserv-


mg, and it is no plan of ours to burn the house down because it
wants repair. We wish first to get the concern out of Chancery,
then to lay its foundations deeper?to add some new wings to it?
and to make it on the whole more cheerful and habitable. So that,
the squatter?s stock being on the grass, they cannot do better than
remain there, and go on in the old routine, till the country is, by
a regular process of survey and settlement, allotted in farms, villages,
and homesteads.
This ought to answer the second question : but we have a mis-
giving that our scheme at this stage will be?by some readers?
? seen through at once ? as a transparent juggle in the interest of the
squatter, on the same principle as ?heads I win?tails you lose;?
for we have bought the run from the lessee, and have left him the
grazing of it still.
For the present we are content to point out that we have been,
so far, quite consistent. Almost the first line written on the project
said that we proposed ? giving the squatter a better bargain than he
has now; ? at the same time our other professions have not yet been
falsified. Now we will go to the root of the matter.
The squatter, after commutation has no run in the same sense
as before, that is, he can neither sell the country nor borrow upon the
security. The run belongs to the Land Board; the squatter holds
from them, subject to three month?s notice, the exclusive grazing: but
if the improvements are allowed to go to decay, or if any acts are
done in contravention of the law, the Board has the power to put the
licensed grazing to auction and to levy on the stock for the repair of
improvements. This power, of course, should be used sparingly?
only as a last alternative, but it must exist and be maintained to
show without a shade of doubt whose the run is.
The question as to the course the Land Board would take with
a licensed run in the event of the sale of stock running on the same,
the death of the owner, or other needful change, is likely to rise.
The duty of the Board in such case would simply be to issue the
license to the actual owner of the stock, unless they saw good reason
against it on public grounds. It is much better that the Board
should possess and exercise a wide discretion in a matter of this
kind, than that a new squatting tenure should be juggled a second
time into existence, through authorising a right of transfer by law.
The stock would probably never be disturbed till in due time the


land came under settlement; but still, in the public interest, the
trust should be maintained unimpaired. Such a tenancy as this,
unless the Commissioners and Land Boards prove utterly incom-
petent and corrupt, can hardly be nursed into the obstructive position
of the tenure extinguished.
Having thus done away with the hostile element in the squatter?s
position, we can afford to give him fair treatment. He is no longer
the monopolist of the pastures with his hand against every man.
The cause of the feud is withdrawn, and peace should follow.
Summing up, then, the general results shown already by the
scheme, the owner of Candowan has fallen into possession of a com-
pact, handsome, freehold estate, upon which he will be able to work
out to the uttermost the problems of improving land and stock, and
of the unalienated portion of his old run he has safer and better use
than he has had for years.
As to the nineteen resident selectors, they can now acquire on
easy terms four times as much land as they could ever have
expected before, and they have peace and security for carrying on
their work. Preliminary survey and the Land Board have displaced
the dilatory and imperfect survey and the legal quibbles which
harassed them and kept their pockets empty.
For the public, a tract of 130,000 acres?larger than half the
run, which was previously spoiled for settlement by Volunteer land
orders and improvement purchases?has been released and placed
under the guardianship of the Land Board?a local body specially
pledged to keep up survey and provide in advance for the settlement
of population.
Now the second phase of the question opens, and we have to
determine how the resumed lands are to be allotted for settlement.
To carry out alienation systematically and impartially would be the
main duty of the Board, and this end would be best attained by
keeping a fixed proportion of each station within the territory alw ays
surveyed. In a tract of country of ten thousand square miles there
would be about sixty stations of various sizes, and the Board, by
means of licensed surveyors acting under the chief officer of the
territory, very shortly after the commutation of the stations was
settled, could have an area on each resumed run marked put and sub-
divided. By thus surveying simultaneously, or as nearly so as pos-
sible, a certain portion on each station, population would be evenly


distributed, and the operation of the Act would be fairly divided. In
this way, there would be no loss or confusion from moving stock in a
hurry, but by steady, well-considered action, the new tenure would be
established in a few years without disaster to any one; but, on the
other hand, its progress would be attended with the profit which
grows from the increased value of freehold land under the influence of
settlement.
A fair proportion to survey at one time in such a territory
would be one-tenth of the whole, which as distributed would be
one-tenth of each original station. The total area so surveyed in a
territory of 10,000 square miles would be 640,000 acres.
In dealing with the survey of a whole territory, especially if
defined hy natural boundaries, a question arises which will be antici-
pated by all aware of the immense variety in value and character of
the lands in this continent. Downs or plains of limestone or volcanic
formation, and beautiful park-like open forest, often abut on moun-
tain masses, impervious, and for grazing or cultivation, worthless.
Elsewhere the ground dividing stations from each other, or forming
the back country, consists of country better than the first, and not by
any means useless, but still not such as could be valued by the acre,
the barren soil so far exceeding in extent that which is avail-
able, No settler would choose land in those tracts, even if he got
it for nothing, and consequently it is not what should be granted to a
lessee on commutation. Such country is found of various types and
different character according to its position. In the intermediate
districts we find stretches of sandy pine range ; towards the coast
we have tracts of fissured sandstone, the ravines full of water and
blady grass ; and to the north and west there are the huge thickets
of brigalow and other acacias running for ten and twelve miles over
the watershed between one valley and another. To survey from the
dividing range in such country would be absurd. The Board should
have the power to draw the line of survey on the edge of the avail-
able country ; and, to do this with justice, will require local know-
ledge and careful supervision. It would, nevertheless, he a mistake
to suppose that all mountain and all scrub is worthless as freehold
property. A proportion of both would be far from objectionable on
a grazing farm. The rocky ranges usually contain the two essentials
of timber and water, and it is well known that the acacia scrubs are
full of tonic and stimulating herbage. Moreover, it has been seen


that the very poorest of the granite and Silurian soils are the most
improvable. Lightly grassed ridges of these formations that naturally
will hardly keep stock alive, have been held to he much more easily
developed in grass-growing power than the richest plains. Clearing
and seeding, a little time and a little labour, under a freehold title,
will clothe such lands in rye-grass and clover.
The rule we would recommend in dealing with inferior country
would be something like this : Let broken country or scrub, so long
as it does not cover over one-sixth of the surface, be measured in* as
available ; but when the proportion is greater, leave the land outside
the survey line, to be dealt with otherwise. Lightly-soiled ridges, so
long as they can be fed over, might be rated as all available, but on
subdivision, lands of such character should, whenever practicable, be
included in the same holdings with other soils of a better kind.
This policy would be found to act in leaving a residue of rough
country, often containing water and coarse grasses, almost always
well timbered, and these remnants would generally be found running
in lines skirting back runs, and holding for some distance a uniform
direction.
If we think what this points to it will become evident that we
need not look on these inferior lands as waste. Some would come
in for drove roads and droving reserves, all would be valuable as
State forests, and experience tells us that these are the very localities
in which mineral deposits are found.
The survey for settlement should be guided by fixed rules. To
leave to the members of a Land Board the discretionary power of
deciding whether any survey for alienation was wanted, or, if wanted,
where it was to be, would in many cases be too heavy a strain on
self-interest. When some years ago a talk arose of surveying
agricultural areas, some very excellent members of the Council
asked?? Where was there any land suitable for agriculture ? ? They
knew of none.
So will it be always?in our time at least. Too severe a strain
must not be applied to the members of the Land Board, or anv
other board. We must be satisfied, at least in commencing local
government, with a moderate exercise of patriotism and public
spirit. The law, then, should be imperative, that on the commuta-
tion of each lease being completed the survey of the resumed lands
shall commence?the first portion so dealt with on each run to be


one-tenth of the area of the original station on the upper frontage
to the main river or creek, and other surveys following when required,
to be on the same frontage lower down ; each survey to be in one
solid block with depth corresponding to frontage, and leaving out
neither the best land nor the worst.
The first survey on Candowan?following these rules?would
be a block of 24,000 acres, or one-tenth of the original station,
about six miles by six on the upper frontage Narghil river, right
bank.
CHAPTER 111.
The subdivision of the surveyed areas is the next step to be
taken. Experience has taught us that, if we wish to found and
encourage the growth of permanent settlement, uniformity of area
is no more to be desired than uniformity of occupation. The true
policy in alloting land is to meet every legitimate want, and to attract
every phase of life, both industrial and social on to the soil. These
will appear in many shapes.
There will be first the youth belonging to a family in the settled
districts. His father will start him with �2,000. This sum, if
invested in squatting, would, excepting under very favourable cir-
cumstances, be speedily lost. It would merely act as a shoeing-horn
to an advance, which, except a rise of prices intervened, would
crush the borrower like a constrictor. �2OOO would, nevertheless,
tell to great advantage on a grazing farm, if access to the land were
made easy and the tenure secure. Holdings up to six thousand
acres should be laid out for this class.
Then there are others with smaller means?perhaps enough to
get a flock of sheep or a small draft of cattle, with something to live
on for a year or two besides. For those there should be a graduated
scale of survey, so that every man might be able to get what he
could pay for and fence in.
Such small properties would, moreover, attract many beyond


the sphere of bush life. City people would start a son or two to
work into such possessions, and there are many in the mother
country, with small capitals or fixed incomes, who would, if the
conditions were made safe for them, come to such a land and such
a climate at once. There are, for example, many retired officers,
men with families larger than their means, and some of the great
numbers who throng the continent to spin out their incomes, might
come here with benefit to us and to themselves if we made it
pleasant for them. Under our present system there is not much
chance for beginners of this educated stamp, A few, of course, may
succeed at times, as others do, in snatching a prize out of the fire,
by having the luck to buy before a rise. Still the instances of such
success are, in the aggregate, few and far between. Any one who
remembers the first ten years of Queensland after separation can
vouch for the fate which attended the efforts of hundreds. They
were the pioneers of the north ; they were fit, as men, to go any-
where and do anything ; but an immense proportion of them, entangled
in unwieldy and unmanageable squattages, sank under debt and
disappeared. But we might, if we chose, offer openings that would
attract and provide for settlers of this kind in numbers. In Tasmania,
freehold homesteads being much more easily procured than on the
main continent, a number of Indian officers have made their homes
there, contributing to the colony a valuable class of settlers, and an
element in society getting very scarce here. They do not aim at
squatting or mining speculations. To live comfortably, and to
improve their little properties, are their main objects. We might,
with our much more varied and numerous advantages of soil and
climate, offer fully as great inducements as Tasmania.
But we have many other wants to meet beyond those of the
youthful colonial of comfortable origin, the scion of successful com-
merce, and the retired army man. We have to make room for far-
mers of all degrees?to find homes for the standard labouring popu-
lation of the bush, and for the future immigrants, to provide access
to the soil for all future industries, and to encourage the growth'in
our inland wastes of urban and village life, in the interests of social
happiness, education, and culture. In short, we have to lay out the
country with an eye to the growth of a nation, and to make our
arrangements so that every man, whether native or imported, may
find a ready and suitable, and, if possible, a congenial opening.

Trying, then, to adapt these views to subdivision, the first
survey-area in the south-western territory of 640,000 acres comes to
he dealt with. It might be parcelled out as follows :
Opened for settlement in one territory by
the survey of one-tenth of each run 10 390 591,600
Remaining for reserves, roads, &c. 48,400
640,000
Under this distribution three-fourths of the surface, in 150 hold-
ings would be directly applied to the development of grazing under
new conditions, with a security and grasp of the soil infinitely greater
than could be acquired under any squatting tenure, and with the
benefit of an experience that the original freehold grazier of sixty
years ago did not command. Judicious clearing, minute paddock-
ing, the spread of water supply, grass tillage, and the storage of
fodder in reserve against bad seasons, would all be operations not
only possible but easy of accomplishment to the resident owner, with-
out making himself a slave either to ? capital ? or ? hired labour.?
It is only common sense to assume that under such conditions we
would have from the same land more stock, and better stock, with
more staple exports than we ever had. The method would meet
every want of our producing industry in a way that never offered
before, and in a manner more beneficent, socially, than squatting
could ever pretend to.
The remainder of the survey, 110,000 acres, being sub-divided
into 1240 holdings of all sizes, from two acres up to 1000, would
meet every other industrial and social want. The man who aimed
at mixed farming ; the labourer who wanted a cottage, a garden, and
grass for a few cows ; the small capitalist or annuitant who wanted


a country homestead ; and the endless demands for experiment would
all be amply suited without trouble or difficulty in a way never pro-
vided before in Australia.
There is one main principle in the subdivision of survey areas
that should never be lost sight of, which is that natural advantages
and defects should be distributed as evenly as possible. Water,
timber, good soil, flooded land, scrub, and barren ridges, ought all to
be dealt with so that no allotment should unduly take the good soil
and throw the bad into that adjoining, or include water and leave
the other lots without. Of course a hard-and-fast rule, or absolute
uniformity, is impossible to put in practice ; but where certain
elements are wanting they might be counterbalanced by others. To
equalise these peculiarities as much as possible, and to apply each
locality to the purpose for which it is best suited, would find exercise
for the judgment of the Board in subdividing. They would soon, if
interested in their work, and comprehending its drift, arrive at a rule
to guide them. For example, a high bank with water-frontage at
a dray-crossing would be the proper site for a village, with, say, a
half-mile of frontage, and the commonage behind. A dry back plain
would naturally make one or two six-thousand-acre grazing farms ;
broken volcanic ridges would properly cut up into small farms and
homesteads, where every kind of small tillage, tree-culture, and vine-
growing might be carried on, and in time it would be seen that eacli
spot of country could be appropriately allotted.
Classification, with various areas, and a scale of prices, has been
advocated as ensuring a wise economy in distributing country, but in
Queensland the method has been found very awkward and insufficient.
At first, under the Act of 1868, hardly two valuators classed in the
same way, and it has only been by classification in the gross that a
standard has been attained. You can tell easily first, second, and
third class country, but the host of intermediate shades, and the
startling contrasts found every half mile when the ground is examined
critically, prove classification to be most incomplete in providing a
standard rule.
But a preliminary survey, allotting evenly the good and the bad,
such as we advocate, is * infinitely better than any classification.
Moreover, it prevents waste in subdivision, and anticipates all
attempts to pick the eyes out of the country.


The survey on Candowan of 24,000 acres might be laid out,
following the foregoing views, in this way:?

1 Grazing farm, 6000 acres, black soil plain, no water 6000

the first survey would be 5000 acres, which could be divided in this
way?
-2 farms of 1500 acres ... ... ... ... 3000
3 ditto 500 ? 1500

Total 4980 acres.
It would become evident as settlement went on that there was
an advantage in including every description of allotment in each
survey. A healthy mixture would produce a more bracing, social
atmosphere?where there is more than one big man in a parish, a
wholesome equilibrium is maintained.
This method of territories, survey, and sub-division, extending
by degrees over all the unsettled country, beginning perhaps with ten
territories nearest to population ; could hardly fail to meet the wants
of all actual settlers, provided the survey were kept up in fair pro-
portion from year to year.
But it does not follow that the Board, however watchful and
alert, could, or indeed should, try to meet every outcry that might
arise from all quarters ; and it should be their constant care to dis-
criminate between the actual wants of settlement and the noisy blow
and frothy fuss of the stags and jobbers who are sure to swarm
? trans Ehenum,? with ? any amount of money.?
The professional landshark will, no doubt, swarm in Australia
as long as money is to be made by working the oracle and avoiding


honest industry, and, as a matter of course, he and his kindred will
always want to get possession of those portions of land which are
likely to benefit them by injuring their neighbours.
The operation of the Act would, however, give no scope for such
attempts as succeed now, through selection, auction, or volunteer
land orders. Surveys would be made only according to rule, or when
the Board in their discretion had decided that settlement required it.
Moreover, the lots, when proclaimed, though open to any one,
would only be open singly as surveyed, and under conditions to be
defined further on.
CHAPTER IV.
We have now to face the question, how these new properties,
farms, and homesteads, are to be acquired ; and this phase of the
question naturally brings us in contact with our old acquaintances,
? the capitalist ? and ? the poor man.?
? Down with the squatter,? cries the one ; ? money must have
the land, and money will have the land,? says the other.
To us, and we doubt not to many of our readers, both these
cries appear to be quite beside the real question. To give way to
either would make but a limping feeble State and a mongrel com-
munity. The plan of survey which has been detailed indicates what
are our views as to settlement. The beacon to which we look shows
the future of Australia as a country more fit to live in than it is at
present?not a wilderness blighted and wasted by the bickerings of
two hostile factions.
We cherish the hope of seeing the land covered with substantial
country houses, smiling homesteads, and cheerful villages, and
inhabited by an educated and united people. We believe in such a
state of things as, without the aid of immigration votes, would by its
own merits attract the landless and homeless of the mother country,
and that, by offering substantial and easily attained advantages
would tempt families of a good type, but of modest means, to come
and live among us.


Neither squatting nor selection, whether separate or together,
can bring about such results. As they are now, the two forces work
like the upper and nether millstone, grinding to powder all the
unwary who come within their action ; and at no time does either
method offer that easy access to settlement and the comfortable
assurance of well-doing that would inspire confidence in immigrants
of a good stamp, and would lead them to induce their friends to
follow.
The only true colonization, such as would make the country
what we want it to be, is that which plants population on the soil
in harmony with natural conditions, and without stripping the settlers
of their means.
Such a method does not exist now, and has not been attempted
in New South Wales for forty years ; hut it succeeded before that
time, as every man may read in the aspect our settled districts
present at this'day, and it can be tried again.
Since then, with the origin of the Wakefield system, and the
beginning of squatting, the same question now before us has been
the nightmare and perplexity of all Australia.
In Victoria, as here, the popular voice has maintained a high
price to keep rich men from buying up the country. If there is any
relation between cause and effect, it is plain that among our southern
neighbours 20s, per acre and a system of small agricultural holdings
have tended to force things into a growth of which the topmost
bough and ornament is the class predominating in certain quarters,
known as the ?wealthy lower orders;? the men who jingle their
money-bags in derision at all humanity, learning, and culture, who
buy up thousands and thousands of acres everywhere, till they can
close country roads and hem in townships.
If access to the land is made difficult, and the operations of the
settlers are cramped and confined, things must necessarily work into
the hands of ? capitalists,? or rather, to speak more accurately, into
the hands of those who have the gift of money-making. The man
whose nature it is to concentrate every faculty on the process of
accumulation is bound in a short time to be the ? capitalist ? of the
district he lives in; and the more obstructively the land law works
to average men, the more chances are thrown in the way of the born
financier, with his eyes fixed intently on the one thing needful, and
his thoughts unhampered by any other considerations.


Our whole system works directly in the interest of this type, and
?this fact we believe is actually the key to what is taking place in
Victoria, as well as in certain forms among ourselves.
The Melbourne banks have backed such men heavily to buy up
selectors. A vicious trade is created by the market thus established.
The selector moves to the next station, or perhaps across the boun-
dary, to repeat the operation. He will clear �1 per acre profit every
time he moves ; and if he has a well-grown family, and the qualities
that make success, it will not be long before he turns over some
thousands of pounds and obtains the respect of the nearest banker.
Then he will get a good stock of sheep, with which he will
travel about, clearing the grass off' over all his neighbourhood, till
he has managed to select right and left and jump and buy odd bits
of country.
In a few years he will in this way shoulder himself into wealth
and respectability; he will be made a J.P., and then, as a full-blown
squatter, he will kick down the ladder he has climbed up by, and
will do his best to make it hot for land-sharks and grass-stealers.
Now, mark the twofold result of this system.
It not only depopulates the country, and engrosses the land in
huge estates, bought with bank money?too often in such hands as
our Melbourne friends gird at; but it also brings into existence a
new body of proprietors who promise to become influential and
wealthy, but of the stamp necessarily produced from the successful
vagabondism and piracy which the law has created.
This is a noteworthy fact, and it throws a strange light on the
social fruits of our institutions.
Whatever may remain to be said in favour of our compound
policy of squatting and selection, all must allow that the prizes are
distributed in an eccentric fashion.
As contrasting with these facts, we are putting forward no un-
tried theory or visionary chimera, when we state that if Victoria had
been allotted in the way that the settled districts of New South
W ales were distributed fifty years ago, or in the way the settled dis-
tricts of Queensland are being occupied now, the settlers would have
found it very much more for their interest to keep their lands than to
sell them at a profit of �1 per acre, and the trade of land-sharking
w r ould not have grown to be a vested interest as it is.
It is plain then that the high price of 20s. acts mainly in


thwarting settlement, and combined with the misdirected policy of
founding settlement on agricultural conditions, it tends most power-
fully to the monopoly of the soil and the corruption of the people.
In our old settled districts, the grants were given free of cost,
but subject to certain conditions. In Queensland the price is low,
the payments being extended over ten years, coupled with conditions
of occupation and fencing ; and in both cases the growth of popula-
tion and local improvement have been in marked contrast to the
decay and depletion reported in the country districts of Victoria.
The method of allotment suggested in our paper of last October
partook in many respects of both these plans, including preliminary
survey, a low price, and extended payment. We have already gone
through the question of survey. The principal novelty in our
suggestion was the commutation of the price into a perpetual
annual payment like the feu tenure in use in Scotland, and the rate
of 6d. per acre per annum was proposed. If this price should be
thought low, it must be remembered that the price of �1 per acre is
almost invariably paid for securing positions which command, or
rather spoil, large tracts, and that as a rule every acre so bought
represents three acres at least made worthless. A glance at any run
on which auction purchases have been made will show this, and the
same rule accounts for the large premium on volunteer land orders.
The same fact is invariably brought out in the choice of selections.
In fact, all buyers have only one motive in buying?to pick out the
eyes.
But under the preliminary survey which we have just detailed,
every inch of country within the survey bounds would be included,
rocky range, scrub, flooded land, and all, and as each allotment
would include a proportion of good and bad soil, the rate of 6d. per
acre per annum, representing at seven per cent, a price of about 7s.
per acre all over, would, on sale, produce a much greater aggregate
return to the Treasury than accrues now through the joint processes
of squatting and selection.
To show what the Scottish feu tenure is, we extract the
following note by Sir Walter Scott:*??ln Scotland a village is
erected upon a species of land-right, very different from the copyhold
so frequent in England. Every alienation or sale of landed property
? St. Honan?s Well,? chapter 1, note.


must be made in the shape of a feudal conveyance, and the person
who acquires it holds thereby an absolute and perfect right of
property in the fief while he discharges the stipulations of the vassal
and, above all, pays the feu duties. The vassal or tenant of the site
of the smallest cottage holds his possession as absolutely as the
proprietor, of whose large estate it is perhaps scarce a perceptible
portion. By dint of excellent laws, the sasines, or deeds of delivery of
such fiefs, are placed on record in such order that every burden
affecting the property can be seen on payment of a very moderate
fee, so that a person proposing to lend money upon it knows exactly
the nature and extent of his security.?
Under this law, an absolute title to land as perfect as a Crown
grant, is acquired by fulfilling certain covenants and paying a small
yearly sum. Almost all suburban and village buildings are erected
on such tenures, and the advantage of the system is seen in the
substantial and durable stonework put up on such holdings, in
contrast to the make-shift brick and stucco erections to be seen on
English and colonial building leases.
The feuar builds for perpetuity. If he maintains the covenants
of his contract, land and house belong to him and his ? while water
runs.? On the other hand the lessee of a building lease parts with
all interest in land and bnilding at the end of a fixed term. As this
period approaches, it is said that such properties begin to get a
forlorn look ; everything seems to be on the way to Chancery, symp-
toms of decay begin to show, tenants will not repair, and rents are
bad to collect; population turns to other and fresher-looking localities;
and, as the end comes, we have heard that both in England and
America, when such long leases have been tried, a general muddle at
last sets in, in the interest of John Doe, Eichard Koe, and their
legal advisers. In Scotland, in contrast to this, you often see sub-
stantial old stone houses which must be more than a century old,
built on small feus, costing a few pounds a year. The thick walls,
the deep windows, the narrow stone staircases, with the steps worn
and grooved by the feet of generations long passed, all give evidence
of the durability of the work and the soundness of the tenure.
The owners of large suburban estates in this colony might
possibly pick up a hint from this, but it is likely that their
grandsons will be better able to understand the subject than
they are. There are lands on the south side of Port Jackson,,


and also at the mouth of the Hunter, that might perhaps some
clay illustrate the building lease method. We will give the owners
a wrinkle. Feu each alternate allotment at a fair rental ; you
will thereby get a much higher rent than your present ground-
rent ; and you will have a population living in houses of free-
stone, granite, and marble, in no time. This will add so to the
value of the intervening lots, that whether you hold, sell, or feu, each
will be worth at least three times its present value, and your suc-
cessors will enjoy the fruits of your sagacity in a tangible form, in-
stead of inheriting a mouldy suburb, honeycombed by law expenses,
with the town stretching away in other directions.
To return to our subject. The application of the feu principle to
our scheme of settlement would have these advantages?it would put
settlers on the land with a secure title without emptying their
pockets to pay the price, while at the same time it would produce a
large, lasting, and increasing revenue.
There is an earlier form of those feudal covenants in which we
find something analagous to our present necessities.
The feudal lord held his estate on condition of providing military
force for the public defence ; consequently, he parcelled out his
domains in farms and feus, and each land or tenement was rated at so
many men on horse or foot, ? boden in cffeir of weir,? as ancient
statutes tell.
We need population just as much, though not for military
purposes, living at present at peace among ourselves, with the azure
sea around us. Still, without conditions of personal residence being
maintained, all attempts at settlement in Australia are futile, and we
would suggest that, as in the feudal tenure, this personal element be
made as prominent and the obligation as stringent as possible. At
the very least we should make residence and fencing the essential
conditions for acquiring land. Let the money payment be simply a
concomitant, but not potent of itself to get a rag of title, and allow
no transfer except after all conditions have been met. Give the
arrangement under which a settler enters upon his allotment as
much the character of a personal covenant as possible. Let it
appear all through that human stock, human industry, residence, and
citizenship are the results wanted by the State. Let it be plainly
seen that money pet' se cannot get the land, but that men can have it
in liberal measure, and on terms easy to meet by all who mean
honest work.


We will next turn to another quarter for a hint. When in
former days a family with a small flock of sheep got on to a piece of
country that cost nothing, they almost always did well. This used
to go on for long till the tendering system came in, and then specu-
lators blocked all the country round by tendering ? from the map.?*
In Queensland, this abuse was for a time checked by a provision in
the Occupation Act, which required country to be actually stocked
according to a certain scale before it could be applied for. Of late,
this stocking condition has become almost a dead letter, owing to an
incautiously worded clause about ? dry country.? As nearly all the
country is applied for now as ? dry,? the run-dealers have it their
own way again. There are sundry points brought out by these
doings to which we would draw attention.
First?there appears clearly the advantage of giving settlers an
easy start. Before the tendering system began, these small primi-
tive squatters had the whole unstocked country to pick from without
cost.
The disadvantage they laboured under was that they were
chancing getting a title. They had no certainty of possession, so
that the improvements of fencing, saving water, and other experi-
ments of to-day were not to be attempted. As contrasted with this,
under our proposed Act the settler would not have the same scope?
he would need to be contented with a defined portion of land, but we
could give him the immense advantages of immediate possession, cer-
tainty of ownership, conditions easy to an honest man, and at a price
which from the mode of payment would fall lightly on him.
Weighing then the greater scope of the first settlers against
the advantages to be gained under the proposed measure, we come to
the conclusion that with the increased knowledge of this day, the
start offered to the small stockowner would be but little less favour-
able than when the whole trackless and often waterless bush was
open to the first comer. In any case it is the best that can possibly
be opened for any one under our present competition.
The history of the tendering system again makes plain how
objectionable and obstructive a title may become if all that is wanted
to secure it is to fill up a form and make a payment to the Treasury,
Unless other stipulations are made binding, and conditions enforced
by regular supervision, declarations become mere matters of form.
Conditions are slummed over or read backwards, and at last, so long


as the rental is paid, the Act is left to work itself, and that prac-
tically becomes a scramble for the benefit of the strong, the unscru-
pulous, and the greedy.
From these various considerations then, we come to the follow-
ing conclusions, confirmed by every view in which we have looked at
the question. The land should be open at as small a cost as possible,
and the title should be worked out under constant supervision.
But though it is desirable to leave the settler the command of
his money on entering upon a holding, it would only be a proper
precaution to get from him some payment as a pledge or earnest of
his intention to carry out his covenant.
If no payment were enforced on the application being made,
many, without due consideration, would come into the Land Office
and sign the papers without ever doing anything more. But if such
a sum were demanded as, without crippling the applicant, would
impress upon him the position he was taking, involving forfeiture for
non-fulfilment, then there would be some guarantee for the validity
of his purpose. A deposit, according to a fixed scale, to meet cost
of survey and departmental expenses, would answer the purpose?
say a minimum of �lO for all holdings under 500 acres, with an
additional �lO for every 500 acres or portion of 500 acres. This
would hurt nobody. It would provide some security that the Act
would not be fooled with, and a good nest-egg would tlms be lodged
in the Treasury.
When improvements, such as dams or fencing, were taken with
a holding, they would be paid for according to assessed value. The
payment for these might either be in cash, or it might be added to
the yearly rental in commuted form. If the amount were heavy, the
latter would be the best method, both for the settler and the Treasury.
A permanent income of �25 or �3O a year would be infinitely better
for the State, according to present experience, than having �5OO in
a lump to help to swell a surplus and provide a fund for political
jobbery.
It may be objected, in reference to the deposit of �lO, that it is
a heavy sum to charge a labourer or artizan going on to a two-
acre village allotment. To this it may be answered that he gets a
homestead ready surveyed, well placed for water, and a right of
commonage of four square miles. It is very doubtful whether one
of those village lots is not as good a bargain, and better for a man


of small means, than a homestead of 100 or 160 acres. The one is
bound to fence only two acres, and he has his right of grazing on the
common; the other is bound to fence the larger area, and has no
right beyond his fence.
Still, if it is thought that the charge is out of proportion,
it might be a good plan to return one half, or �5 each, when
the village community had by joint arrangement completed the
fencing of their common to the satisfaction of the Board. This
would be highly advantageous for all. Fencing would double
the grazing value of the common, and it might, by encouraging
combination, lead to the forming of a small municipality.
As a necessary adjunct to a fencing law, there would be
no right of impounding on unfenced land ; trespass would,
nevertheless, be dealt with by the Board; but as the remedy
would be taken out of the hands of the owner of the land,
there would be a wholesome pressure brought to bear which
would be favourable to fencing being completed without delay.
A holding would be got in this way. The intending
settler would go to the Land Office, and point out the
surveyed lot, which he had decided upon, on the territorial
map. He would then tender payment of his deposit at the
rate of �lO for every 500 acres, or portion of the same.
He would tlten be called upon to read aloud the conditions
on which he made application. These would be ? That he
entered upon the land on his own behalf, and not as agent
for any other person ; that the land should be the residence
of himself and family for the next four years ; that he
undertook to fence in the same to the satisfaction of the
Board within the next two years, and that he bound himself
to pay a perpetual rental yearly at such time and place as
might be required ; also, to pay for improvements on the ground at
assessed value; that the Land Board on their part hold power by
law to eject him from the holding should he fail to keep these
conditions, but that, on his completing his covenant, he shall receive
a complete assignable title to the land, reserving only to the Crown
the perpetual annual rental.?
He shall then sign the above conditions in the book, and any
document or receipt given him must be a counterpart of the same.
The paper, too, must be such as he can make nothing by handing


over, or pledging. Moreover, it would be better to give it a spice of
tbe feudal tenancy, to make it appear not as a conditional title so
much as a ? convenant to enter upon and improve lands.?
Then let the applicant go on the ground at once. He will have
no doubts or difficulties about the position of his holding, about
unsurveyed boundaries or shadowy reserves, which may be a mile this
way or a mile that way for anything anybody knows. None of these
traps for the unwary which fill the bags of our surveyors and.
solicitors, can be set for him, but he may begin to put up his house
or his outside fence the day after he signs the book.
Let the inspection be carried on constantly and registered
quarterly. If the eye of the Board represented by proper agents is
everywhere, the black sheep will soon be picked out ; and when once
spotted they can get a double amount of official attention.
To form an inspecting staff, every junior clerk or cadet of the
territorial lands and survey offices should have in rotation three
months a year in the saddle, doing this duty and writing in his note
book all details, to be posted up. When necessary the Commissioner
or a member of the Board could visit the spot and come to a decisive
opinion on any doubtful matter. Let no locality be twice inspected,
by the same officer in succession, so that every case will show reports
by various hands. By such means a summary of evidence would
appear under each heading which could leave no doubt as to whether
the conditions of fencing and residence were fulfilled, or were not.
Finally, to give this effect, we must leave in the hands of the
Land Board full discretionary power to administer the Act ; and to
get rid of defaulters of all kinds?dummies, trespassers, grass-
stealers, perjurers, land sharks, et hoc genus omne, who now crowd
our land-offices.
It may be objected that we are making the Land Board a little
too paternal altogether?that no man will have a chance with them.
We sincerely hope that they may be able to curb the license of fraud
and intimidation which disgraces our present system ; and if they
are still thought to be too despotically endowed, it must be remem-
bered that their powers will be within the limits of the Act, and that
they ought to be carefully defined.
Moreover, we yearly grant as great or greater power under the
Commission of the Peace. The magistrates are called upon by law
to exercise their discretion conscientiously in the issue of public-house


licenses, and the use they make of this discretionary power is to
establish dens of drunkenness and infamy, wherever a few pounds are
being spent.
They will say, no doubt, that they are bound to act in this way
to support the vested interests of the country, and we understand
that most of the respectable colonists think the justification sound.
All we can say is, that whatever a Land Board may do, the
exercise of their powers will be beneficence and virtue compared with
the work of the licensing magistrates.
CHAPTER V.
The constitution and functions of our Land Board are matters that
will require close consideration.
Perhaps the most successful instance that w r e can bring forward
of a delegated trust being successfully carried out in the colony by a
Board of laymen or civilians has been the Council of Education.
That experiment has shown that we have private citizens possessing
the needful integrity and capacity to administer public business, and
who are willing to undertake responsible duty without emolument.
Now, the composition of the Council is changed. It is much
more official than formerly, and it has almost become a branch of the
Civil Service. It is said that the next stage of its existence will be
extinction?to be followed by the establishment of a regular Depart-
ment in its place.
Our statesmen long to concentrate in the grasp of Government
the whole public life of the colony, and moreover they must try to
appease the leech-like craving of their supporters for enlarged pat-
ronage and expenditure.
It is not to be expected that every territory in New South
Wales should be able to furnish -men of a stamp equal to those who
composed the Council some years ago, but there are in most parts of
the country individuals quite competent to act in public matters when
their course of action is well defined, and their discretion limited
within the four corners of an Act. Moreover, the action of a Land


Board would be fenced in by many important checks. They would
be jealously guarded by the publicity attending every step of their
adjudication ; with their records open to inspection by the public,
and publication by the Press, and lastly by the members themselves
living in the field of their operations, among the people directly in-
terested in the due performance of their duties.
Distance, muddle, and the intricacies of red tape are the best
friends that centralization has, and the best securities for the success
of local government are to be found in the propinquity and notoriety
that bring all public doings daily under the microscopic view of the
whole community.
But admitting that men qualified for the duty are to be hud,
how are we to get them ? Every form of local government in the
mother country is based upon election by landholders and contributors
to rates, and without doubt, at some future time, the same principle
should be applied in New South Wales. But in looking at our
present position, we find reason to doubt the expedience of applying
the representative principle to local land administration. The com-
munity cannot be called, politically, in a healthy state. The land-
feud has split our population into sections. Few who enter the
witness-box, or ascend the local bench to hear a case of ? selector
versus squatter ? bear an unprejudiced judgment. So far from that,
nine out of ten scout the idea of losing a chance to be ? down ? on their
? natural enemies,? for this is what legislation has made the people
of New South Wales, Lads from the same parishes, and sometimes
of kindred blood, are now, as grown men, daring and cursing each
other from the rival ranks. Under such a blight of discord it is
clear that to appoint the members of a Land Board by election would
merely be to stir up the depths of faction. If so, all rational admin-
istration would be hopeless, and every section of the Act that aimed
at fairness or reasonable compromise would become a dead letter.
The majority in such case would simply work the Act so as to do as
much damage as possible to the rival party.
The only alternative remaining is, that the members should bo
appointed by the Crown. If we reflect on what some late Govern-
ments would do under such circumstances, we must admit that we
are impaled on the horns of a dilemma. All we can say is, that the
Government which passes our Act will also be competent and ready
to appoint suitable Land Boards.


An experienced observer who has read this length, has just
remarked, ? Your Board of five, however you get it together, will, in
most cases, consist of two roughs who are men of property, and two
roughs who have no property, with the Commissioner. The two
sides will vote against each other on all questions. The Com-
missioner will most likely refuse to ?go in ? with either, and
consequently he will be abused and insulted by each alternately.
Most likely every Land Board will end in a dead-lock.?
This view of the matter has a certain truth in it, though
strongly coloured. But, if we are to suggest any amendments at all,
we must put them forward on the supposition that there are higher
elements both in the people and their representatives than have
hitherto been conspicuous, and that these will appear when occasion
arises to prompt their action.
It is also to be remembered that men often rise to the level of
the duties which they are called on to perform. Narrow ideas,
careless habits, and social imperfections do not hinder those possess-
ing these defects from making excellent officials, shrewd and trust-
worthy bankers, or managers of public companies. We may have
seen an unscrupulous politician at times become an excellent judge,
and we can see almost every day that the ambition to be considered
? a gentleman ? still places a man under some wholesome restraint ;
so we cannot but think that some such motive would w r ork favourably
if the Land Board were placed by law in a responsible and dignified
position.
This part of our scheme is still not sufficiently clear, but we
cannot make more of it. To the future must be relegated the
problem of finding material for Land Boards. The prospect may be
misty, but it is not by any means hopeless. With every view of the
matter, a voice seems to repeat and reiterate the same rallying cry
and the same warning, and re-echoed it may rouse to action, those
who have too long hung in the back-ground. The key-note is
always the same?? Get your best men?your honest and intelligent
men?in the front. Let no man live at ease in days when Govern-
ment has become a mockery and the State has become rank with
abuses and corruption.?
Meantime, all we can say further about the selection of the
members is this:?They should be chosen mainly from good
character and lengthened experience. It is desirable that the


appointments should he conferred on men not interested in the lands
being dealt with, lint in many territories it would be impossible to
avoid nominating squatters and selectors. In such cases, extreme
opinion or a bias to faction ought to be considered valid objections to
an appointment being made, and care should be exercised to elect
those only noted for moderation and integrity. Men with these
qualities are to be found in all classes here, but they are invariably
absent in a scramble for office, and need to be sent for.
The commissioner, the chairman of the Board, will be a marked
man. His duties will be heavy, and his responsibility great; but, in
reality, there will be far less difficulty in finding a suitable official
than in selecting the lay members. A dozen men could be easily
picked out of the Lands and Survey staff' well qualified for the office
?in fact, far better qualified than most of the Legislative Assembly,
with all their friends and adherents.
He, the commissioner, must be the head of the Board, both judi-
cial and executive. He must interpret the Act, and the execution
of all orders must be through him only.
The duties of the four other members would be like those of
councilmen. They would advise, deliberate, and watch the operation
of the law. To prevent the scandal of dissension, or the intrigues of
faction, it would be desirable that no order should he made except
from a unanimous vote. It might be a good plan to adopt the rule
that when the members failed to agree, the case should be adjourned
to the next sitting so as to give time to all to observe and inquire
into the matter in discussion. At the next sitting, the award if
given, should be signed by not less than three out of a Board of
four, or four out of a Board of five. No order should be signed by
fewer than three members, of whom the Commissioner should be one.
Some may remark that our scheme, so far as self-government
goes, puts great power in the hands of the Commissioner, and
leaves very little to the civilian members. This is not either the
aim of the Act, or the result which we would expect from its
working.
Tike civilian members can place a complete veto on all the com-
missioner?s proceedings if they find it necessary to do so, but they
cannot work the Act in their own way in spite of him.
The machinery will work freely, and will get through a deal of
important business if the members act in harmony.


The official, qualified by his administrative experience, would
control the operation of the Act, and keep the apparatus in good
trim ; while the civilian members could bring their knowledge of the
country and people to bear with most telling effect.
Both elements, each in its proper sphere, would operate to great
advantage, in dealing with the settlement of the lands, and also in
initiating local Government.
But, if faction divides the Board, and it is sought to abuse its
functions, or drive a coach through the Act, the self-acting check
comes into play, and the dead-lock that follows is pretty sure to lead
to such complaints and criticisms by the public and the Press, as
will, ere long, effectually purge the body of its obliquities, or change
the personality of its members.
The Land Board should possess the widest discretion in its
functions, especially in the means used to obtain information or evi-
dence. The pow r er of citing witnesses would be essential to its
successful working. The Commissioner and other members should
have the option of proceeding to any locality when any question arose,
whether relating to conditions of settlement fulfilled,' proposed sur-
veys, subdivisions, or any other matters that might need personal
investigation, and expenses so incurred should be paid from the
Territorial Land Fund.
One constant duty of the Board would be keeping up the survey
of land for settlement, as required on each resumed run. If a fixed
rule is followed of keeping one-tenth of the original area always
surveyed, and a yearly revisal is held for this purpose, there will
hardly be room for dissension or abuse on that score. Bnt besides
there w 7 ould be daily duty from the time the commutation was com-
pleted?in arranging cases that would constantly arise?encroach-
ments, trespasses, abuse of drove roads, reserves, &c. Mainly
through the resident civilian members, the Board w 7 ould possess an
intimate knowledge of all that went on in the territory, and the
merits of every case would be got at without difficulty. Questions
that under centralisation would bloom into ? causes celebres ? in
King-street, or might lead to a new form of muddle, and a dozen
new billets being created, w 7 ould be nipped in the bud at once by the
Board?s summary jurisdiction. The limiting the right of appeal to
the first Assize Court would have a most important effect in check-
ing litigation. At present a wealthy suitor has it in his pow'er to


ruin an opponent by dragging him from Court to Court, and if a
litigant were allowed to deal with the Board?s decision in like
manner their power against wealth would be vain.
This is our suggestion for the establishment of Land Boards,
and there is nothing in the functions with which we have endowed
them beyond the power of the people and Parliament to bestow.
? Vested interests ? will of course condemn the idea as unsuited
for the country, unconstitutional, and visionary.
The difficulty in carrying the suggestion into practical form is
just what the public choose to make it. It is no greater than
what we shall always meet with in every attempt to promote local
government, and the arguments used against this proposal will
always be urged against every demand for decentralisation.
If the public voice confirms the verdict of centralisation, it will
not be from any impossibility of establishing local government, or
because that would be useless or unworkable.
It will rather be from the aversion to reform of a people demo-
ralized till they are unfit for the civic duties with which their fore-
fathers were familiar, who have been broken in to beg and toady at
head-quarters for what should be in their own hands, who have been
reared devoid of public spirit, without trust in each other, sensitive to
one influence only?that of the breeches pocket?and unconscious of
the strongest of all ties that bind people together in the old world ;
here only known as an electioneering joke, but elsewhere called
patriotism.
But we have still some faith in the sense and honour of the un-
known many who meddle little in politics. The hope of our whole
future as a nation, not merely the question of land reform, hinges on
the part which they may take in future public matters.
CHAPTER VI.
The revenue accruing from our new Land Law, its amount,
collection, and appropriation, are the next subjects to claim our at-
tention.


Taking the same territory of ten thousand square miles, or six
millions four hundred thousand acres as our basis, we find that?
200,000 acres are under process of alienation to selectors,
(100,000 have been bought by the lessees of runs.
The last sales represent a contribution to the revenue of at least
�600,000.
These figures have some significance in our present circum-
stances.
They illustrate the policy of late years adopted by the financiers
concerned in squatting, namely that of buying up all the good
country on their stations. The Territory feeds 1,500,000 sheep.
The �600,000 is dead capital on the backs of these sheep at the rate
of 8s per head. The operation, so far, may be sound, that is, with
fair seasons and fair prices ; but will the sheep carry more ? If
they cannot, the purchase of land must come to an end on each
station at a certain point. It may then be assumed that, as each
station acquires a certain freehold, the owner will cease to buy. Still
this will not be uniformly correct. A proportion of - runholders will
strain their credit to the utmost to secure more land. There is a
mania at such times as these ; and, moreover, mortgagees are much
safer than the owners of stations in facilitating these operations.
Though their client may come to grief under the weight of his ad-
vances, the more land bought, the better the security is. There is
nothing new so far. These phenomena merely point to a very com-
mon result following the working of stations under advance. But a
perplexity, new in form if not in substance, shows, when we observe
that the Banks, which have been for some time helping largely the
purchase of land from Government, have also been daily receiving
large deposits from the Treasury. Their returns show greater busi-
ness, larger profits, increased deposits, and proportional discounts ;
but, it is beginning to be asked, ? Where do their receipts come
from, and on what security are they advancing ??
Their credit is no doubt good for all demands by depositors,
and they have besides in their safes deeds for land rated at a high
value. But, formerly, when the pinch such lands were found
to be inconvertible. There are disagreeable possibilities in all this.
Suppose that the squatters cease to buy land, either from having
secured enough, or from having ? reached the length of their tether,?


then our revenue will melt away ike summer snow, and all our
present arrangements connected witli public works, taxation, and
other Government business will be thrown out of gear. Suppose
that the Government in their necessity calls up the surplus deposited
in the banks?their action might tell in many quarters ; but no
doubt our rulers have counted the cost and are prepared?for two
Treasurers, besides numerous politicians, have declared emphatically
that we are ? all right.?
Meantime we have gone far enough into these depths.
It is time enough to sing V de profundis ? when we can sing
nothing else.
We have merely put forward these considerations to show that
the land revenue in its present proportions can hardly be expected to
keep up.
The revenue from the territory that can be depended on under
the present Act will he principally?
Squatting and pre-lease rental ?400 runs, of 16,000 acres, at �3O. �12,000
Selections, 200,000 acres, at Is. annual rent 10,000
In round numbers �22,000
Under the proposed law the territory during the first year after
commutation would be apportioned as follows :
Total area, 6,400,000 acres.
Lands previously sold on stations .. ... ... ... 600,000 acres.
Granted under commutation ... 1,000,000
Selections, residence proved ... 200,000 ~
Pre-emptives granted ... ... ... ... ... ... 600,000 ~
First resumption survey ... ... ... ... ... 640,000 ~
Total area dealt with ... ... 3,040,000 acres
Leaving for future survey and settlement now under
license ... ... ... ... ... .. ... 3,360,000 acres
1. The first item then in our new revenue would be the license
fee on the resumed runs, in round numbers, 5,000 square
miles, at 10s. ... ... .. �2,500'
2. Next would be the selectors? rent, 200,000 acres, at Is., as
before ... ... . ... ... ... ... ... 10,000'
3. Then there would be the rent due by conditional purchasers
on the new pre-emptives, which might be made at once on
the same footing as other purchases, at 6d. per annum
perpetual rent, 600,000 acres, at 6d.... ... .. ... 15,000


4. The next items would be small the first year, but,
ultimately, they would take great proportions. If 200,000
acres were taken up out of the first survey of 640,000, the
receipts would be?Deposits about
5,000
Rental
5,000
_ .
Total revenue first year after commutation ...
�37,500
The progress of the Act will depend on the manner in which
he surveys have been made. If this work has been done fairly and
udiciously it will be generally published about that people in these
colonies never had so favourable an opportunity to get land before,
and it is reasonable to suppose that settlement will increase. For
he second year probably the first survey would be enough, but if a
demand set in, a second general survey should be commenced at
once. In some territories it might be sufficient merely to make up
the area open to settlement to the proportion of one-tenth, but of
this each Board must judge. A Board that does not keep land in
he market ahead of the demand will not have much peace.
It is to be kept in mind that there would still remain in this
one territory after the first survey was taken off, over 3,000,000 of
acres untouched.
It is impossible for us to trace the progress from year to year.
Too many ? unknown quantities ? will enter into the solution of the
problem ; but there is nothing improbable in the supposition of a
steady, and even rapid, growth. No such chance was ever offered
before legally, either to the large man or the small.
Let us then hazard a guess at what the ultimate money result
would be. It is allowing a large margin for roads, reserves, and
unsold land to take off one million of acres ; and there is nothing
extravagant in expecting that during the next ten or fifteen years
two millions might be alienated and settled. If so, by that time,
the revenue would stand thus. The two first items of �2500 and
�lO,OOO we may suppose to have lapsed. In place we would
have?
1. Perpetual rental, commencing first year ... �20,000
2. 2,000,000 acres at 6d. ... ... 50,000
Or, a permanent rental from the territory of �70,000 a year.
In this the deposits coming in annually in taking up land have not
been counted. These would go a long way towards payment of sur-
vey and departmental expenses.


If �70,000 a year is got from a tract of country measuring
100 miles each way, after one-eighth of the best has been otherwise
disposed of, and still retaining one million of acres of rough country
in the form of reserves, most people in Australia will admit that it is
a good public revenue, and that the lands have not been mismanaged,
especially if the fact is kept in view that each separate contribution
to this income represents so much actual family settlement.
But many old New South Wales politicians will say that the
country is sacrificed, and, so far as that goes, we freely and gladly
admit that, for their purposes, it is not only sacrified, but utterly
ruined.
The success of our method rises on the very ruins of their policy.
No more shall our territory be the scene of a burning feud between
two rival interests, both candidates for official countenance, and
paying heavily for the same. No more shall its resources contribute
to form a huge surplus to pamper centralization, and clog the
Sydney banks with deposits. No more shall our stations be kicked
about between the Lands Office, the Exchange, and King-street.
No more shall an elaborate muddle give statesmen the opportunity
to make new billets for their sons, friends, and creditors. If these
results involve ruin to the country, then let us welcome ruin with
hearts full of thankfulness !
The gross revenue for the territory would actually be consider-
ably in excess of this sum of �70,000. There would be in addition,
first the deposit for survey and departmental expenses, as detailed in
paper 4, and moreover there would be the payment for improvements
in commuted form, added to the rental.
These, on many of the grazing farms, would be expensive. A
6000-acre farm with �5OO worth of fencing or wells, would cost, on
application?deposit, �l2O ; rent per annum, �l5O ; and �3O a
year commuted payment for improvements.
On the allotment of the smallest size there should be a minimum
rent of, say �l. At the rate of Gd. per annum, with �lO deposit,
a 40-acre homestead will thus cost exactly the same as a 2-acre
village lot with commonage. We have already shown that there is
no great difference in real value between the two classes of holdings.
Each is suitable for a certain purpose.
It would appear then to be a fair thing to make the minimum
rental that of 40-acres, namely, �l?each lot, of course, being liable


to pay �lO on application, and in the case of villages one-half to be
returned on the common being fenced in. Something further may
be said about the inequality of the deposit. If sq, it is to be
remembered that these small allotments cost nearly as much in survey
and even more in official supervision than the larger ones. In fact,
the work of allotting and looking after these small holdings will be
pro rata, infinitely greater than the larger. Moreover the need for
a pledge or guarantee for good faith in occupying the land cannot be
overlooked, and for this object a sum under �lO would be of little use.
From these sources, then, we may safely add to the revenue
�5OOO to �lO,OOO a year for deposits, terminating of course when
alienation ceases?and �5OOO to �6OOO a year as payments for im-
provements, which latter would be permanent rental.
Six per cent, on all the improvements on sixty stations would
of course come to a much larger sum than �5OOO to �6OOO, but we
have assumed that the lessee will in all cases elect his grant to include
his head station, with all the most valuable works and positions
around, and the ground is on that supposition valued as picked land,
improved, and highly productive, at 20s. per acre.
In one view, it might be more logical to value the land for the
lessee?s grant a t the same price as the land open to purchase, namely
6d. per annum or 7s. per acre ; but if so?to make it even?it would
be necessary to charge lessee for the improvements contained within
the grant, and to curtail his right of choice.
This last might be done by making it one of the conditions of
the grant, that it should be conterminous on two sides with the outer
surveyed boundary of the station ; or, the Board might determine
the position of the grant entirely according to their own discretion.
On the whole, we think the original proposal, though lumping
things somewhat roughly, meets the merits of the case on all sides
much better than the latter method.
For purposes of revenue, the difference between the two plans
would not be very great.
And now we go on to consider the mode of collection. The
rent should be payable yearly at a fixed date?say, the 30th September
?at the Local Land Office. Promptitude and regularity would be
greatly stimulated by the inspection constantly going on. The
doings and position of every settler or applicant would be known to
the Board at all times, and it would come within the scope of their


discretion whether a neglect or evasion should be dealt with by
caution, reminder, warning, or notice to quit.
When, after paying deposit and signing the book, nothing
further is done?no improvement or residence appears on the land?
cancelment after three months should be imperative, and the money
forfeited.
The synthetic concord which would thus bring every official
wire within the Land Office would have a telling effect in aiding ad-
ministration. The picture and history of every settler would be in
the Commissioner?s desk. The honest, bona fide man would find
himself soon in high esteem, while the pointer, the grass-stealer, and
the dummy would find their paths full of thorns, and every man
would find it for his interest to pay up to the rent day.
The matter coming next in order is the appropriation of the
territorial revenue. The expense attending survey, assessment, and
supervision while the commutation is going on will necessarily be
heavy, and this will fall within the first year.
Probably the initiatory cost of feature survey and subdivision
in one Territory of 10,000 square miles, or sixty stations would be
�12,000, and the departmental expenses attending the administra-
tion, assessment, and commutation would be �B,OOO more.
This is a full estimate, but a cheese-paring economy is often
the worst of waste. There is no use in half done work, and that will
always be done by a badly manned and under-paid staff. What is
wanted is to get value for the money in work that will endure and
erect its own monument
Red tape stands aghast?spend �20,000 in the bush !
Centralization appeals to Australia and to the world against
such reckless extravagance. Our answer is that the most utterly
dissolute extravagance in the power of a Land Board will be a mere
bagatelle if contrasted with the �lOO,OOO lately swamped in railway
iron, and seemingly hushed up for some good reason?or with the
public resources sacrificed to'conciliate the banks in 1876 and 1877.
The practical difficulties in carrying out survey and commutation
will be small. The Survey Department will be only too glad to
meet half-way legislation which favours the adoption of natural
features and fixed lines as data. Our surveys have suffered for years
from the perplexing action of free selection, under which the licensed
surveyor?s time is wasted in fixing the position of detached allots


merits, a kind of work most unprofitable to him, and, moreover,
raising endless difficulties in the way of reliable connection and com-
pilation. The advantages of the new survey would be manifest, as
the boundaries and subdivisions would all be marked first on the
ground, and the areas and descriptions would be worked out from
these marks.
The geodetic survey now in progress could not conflict with this
survey in any way, and errors would be impossible except those
merely clerical, because its validity would depend neither on accuracy
in lineal measurement nor in compass hearings, but on watersheds
that could be traced, on streams with defined banks that could be
followed, on posts sunk in the ground, and other durable marks
accurately plotted and registered.
We will then assume that we have got value for the disburse,
ment during the first year of �20,000.
For the following year one half of this sum would meet amply
all departmental and survey wants, keeping plenty of land in the
market, and we think that much less would be sufficient.
If our readers have followed the foregoing figures, they will see
that from the first there would be a large and growing surplus. The
year of commutation, with all our outside estimate of expenditure,
there would be left after paying expenses, at least �12,000 for one
Territory, and as time went on, it would be found that the deposits
and improvement payments were fully sufficient for all expenses, and
the permanent rental would remain after alienation ceased, almost
clear profit.
In treating of the application of this annual revenue, the produce
of Local Government (for no centralisation could ever produce it),
we shall be brief. '
Remit one-half the surplus yearly to the Central Government
for those purposes which require capital outlay ?not for current ex-
penses ; for instance, to pay our debts?to make through railways?
to nourish immigration?to provide for the Courts of Law, and
Legislative expenses, the public defence, and the lighting and survey
of the coast; and retain the other half to be applied to such local
purposes as our American kinsmen apply their waste territory?the
construction of roads and branch railways?the erection of educational
endowments, and, among others, the maintenance of a Territorial


Agricultural Department, with a Museum and College of Agricul-
ture, Forestry, and Mines.
If each new attempt at Local Government does not bring out
the power to work?if new centres do not produce new men and new
ideas ?then our experience is at fault; and, if the best we can do
here under representative Government is to work in order to enrich a
capital, manipulated by half a dozen political quacks, then better far
to retrace our steps to Crown Government under such men as Sir
John Young or Sir Richard Bourke.
CHAPTER YII.
We have hitherto considered the proposed measure only in its
application to that part of the squatting country nearest to population,
the same being divided into ten Territories.
The country so dealt with would form a tract of about 500
miles long by 200 wide?a good slice out of the heart of New South
Wales ; but there would remain two considerable areas, namely, the
old Settled Districts, of smaller extent and generally of inferior
character, but much more densely peopled than the first; and the
Western Districts of the colony?a much richer but dryer country,
reaching to the borders of South Australia and Queensland, very
sparsely inhabited.
As to the Settled Districts, in many quarters all the lands that
up to this time have been considered worth buying are freehold
already, but it is possible that at the annual rental of 6d. per acre a
great many inferior tracts may be taken up?for various purposes
not necessarily wholly industrial, but as the mountain country on the
railway lines is at present being occupied. It is also not at all
unlikely that new industries may follow the adoption of a system
that would place people readily and cheaply in possession of these
lands. The huge stretches of wilderness almost untouched between
the Hawkesbury and the Hunter might possibly prove productive in
some manner if so dealt with, and there is an immense acreage all
along the main range that under this treatment might be utilised.


These tracts have all wood and water in abundance, with rough
grass clothing the deep soils of the gullies; there is no want of
mineral deposits, building stone, and many other materials and pro-
ducts that would be highly prized if they were in the rich though
naked western plains.
But there are other regions in the Settled Districts of better
character where a survey is much wanted, if for no better purpose
than to define the ownership of land. It is by no means uncommon
for some of our proprietors to fence in adjoining land and chance the
title, and the work of Local Land Boards would certainly unearth a
good many of such cases.
Looking at the matter in these various lights we are almost
convinced that the application of the Act to the Settled Districts
would be equally advantageous as elsewhere, and that a fair revenue
might reasonably be expected ; nothing certainly equal to that to be
got from the resumed squattages, but still enough to pay the expense
of a thorough survey and registration?and no revenue could be
better laid out than for that purpose.
The work of the Land Boards in the Settled Districts would be
light compared to those in the squatting country, for there would be
no commutation necessary. Their duties would be, to complete survey
and registration, to settle cases of trespass or abuses of the drove
roads, and to keep under strict supervision the forest and other
reserves ; all highly important functions, and such as could be only
satisfactorily carried out by local authority, but there would be com-
paratively little new settlement, and no presure of work such as is
sure to appear elsewhere.
The outside districts have next to be dealt with, ?the dry, waste,
? never-never ? country. How often have we not heard that every-
where beyond a certain point, the country was unfit to live in?
nothing but drought, desert, scorching heat.
The first settlers had hardly reached Gunning and Carcoar be-
fore the ? desert ? began to be talked of. It could not be far off'
because somebody had ridden a day and a night without water.
A party from Bathurst went south-west about forty years ago.
They left the Lachlan near where Cowra stands now, and made for
the Murrumbidgee through grassy waterless forest. One of the
number went mad from thirst and died somewhere, not far from
Wantobadgery, within a few miles of the river. Twenty years later


the Lambing Flat, nearly on their line of route, was notorious as a
hopelessly dry country. Now a thriving community lives there on
well filled creeks ; and the miners at Young, the very spot, often
cannot sink for water. Read Mr. Landshorough?s account of his ride
over Peak Downs without water, and study all he says on the changes
following occupation. You have from him the pioneering experience
of one-third of a century. Go to Rockhampton and look at Grace-
mere Lake. There were races run on the bottom twenty-one years
ago. There is now a never-varying depth of 8 feet water. Read Sir
Thomas Mitchell?s account of the Darling at Fort Bourke in 1838?
the bed of sand and gravel, the saline pools, the reaches of water in
places hardly joined by a slender thread, and often detached?the
boat to go down the river, built, and waiting for a fresh to start.
Now the steamer has been to Brewarrina and Walgett. What do all
these converging lines of evidence point to ? If we are to look at the
matter in the light of common sense, it makes plain as the sun that
there is nothing new in the outside districts of to-day?that what has
been shall be again?that every new piece of country, when occupied,
will be condemned for the old reasons as unfit for population ; that
each new tract will in due time conform to the same laws and meet
the same requirements,?perhaps not in equal measure, for climate
must always be an element in the question of settlement, but if pop-
ulation is growing- and flourishing in the valleys of the Mary and
the Fitzroy, the same people will not be daunted by the Darling and
the Paroo,
The practical difficulty in applying the Act to the outside
districts would be the impossibility of forming local Land Boards.
A territory of 100 miles each way in these regions would often
contain not more than two hundred people. The benefit of the Act
would be found in establishing the tenure on a right basis, in defining
runs, in protecting legitimate squatting interests, and in providing
suitable opening for settlement against the approach of population
which might be tardy, but would be certain. It is better to look
ahead and open a safe and easy channel for the coming tide than to
have a renewal of the land feud at the end of every ten years.
Cooper?s Creek is practically no further away than the Darling was
twenty years ago. There is no good policy in being wilfully blind.
The forces that have been at work in the past will still be at work in
the future.


Moreover, the welfare of the community is in no slight degree
concerned in guarding against the future growth of a spurious
property in Crown lands. A respite to the outside districts would
be quite sufficient to build up a run-jobbing interest with dozens of
financiers backing it up, and all the old evils crowding into it. The
general public are not the only or the chief losers by the present state
of things. Many a purchase of country has been made of late years
? under the best advice ? for prices that will never be got back again
?stocked runs at prices equal to three times the value of the stock,
and bare blocks which, by their extent and position, must land the
buyer, unless a veritable millionaire, ere long in the money market.
Many owners would throw up their bargains now if they could
save anything out of the fire. If our new system can give better
chances to such purchasers it will not be the smallest of the good
things it will do.
It may be said that in stopping the trade in country we stop
pioneering. The whole tendency of our scheme shows that this is an
error. The general policy of the Act would place within the pioneers?
reach a substantial freehold, and the ground fed on by his stock
would be under a tenure good against any other stock owner ; but, of
course, liable to alienation under regular survey. Things would go
on as before. The holding title would be more secure than ever, but
the vicious gambling and borrowing principle would be expunged.
The squatter could sell his stock on the grass ; but he could not sell
the country, excepting his freehold, on receiving his title. Something
like this works well in America. The settlers use the unsold land
for grazing, but a preliminary survey is always kept ahead of popu-
lation ; and as the human tide approaches, those who want more
room have to go further back. Under the proposed method?the
surveyed land open at one time being only one-tenth of the size of
?the station?there would be in most cases a good breathing time
before the run was disposed of piece-meal, and at length the owner
would be left in possession of a handsome freehold in the middle of
a settled country.
The commutation of these outside stations would be best carried
out by an Itinerant Commission, with a proper staff. A good deal
of this country has been surveyed of late, but it would have been a
tedious and difficult process at one time to define boundaries in these
regions. Sometimes the frontage blocks only were secured, and


those behind, though claimed, were chanced. Other blocks were held
for a year or two and vacated afterwards, and a good deal was under a
very hazy title till a chance to sell turned up. These matters are,
no doubt, less indefinite now, but still there would not be the less
need that the stations should be defined and consolidated, in antici-
pation of the progress of settlement.
The commutation, when completed, would leave things out-
wardly in the old shape, plus a good survey of the country ; but the
maps that would remain hanging in the courthouses at Bulcannia
and Murchison would show each station divided into three portions
?the block on the upper part of the frontage being labelled, ?Grant
to lessee under commutation the block on the lower frontage being
labelled, ? Resumption survey, open for settlementand the large
block in the centre being labelled, ? Licensed run, subject to re-
sumption and survey.?
The knowing hands would grin at the charts, and declare it was
all a farce?and that as things had always been so they would
always be, for to them the past and the future are alike unknown ;
but in due time and season natural law would not fail to set in
motion the forces released by the common sense of the nation and
embodied in the Act.
CHAPTER VIII.
Our scheme is now before the readers of the Herald. Let them
judge as to whether it will accomplish the purposes for which it has
been framed.
The squatter was at war with the community. He had to hold
his possessions with the strong hand. The selectors harassed him
on front and flank, while debt undermined him, and the Government
granted him respite only by exacting black mail.
We have brought him peace, and we have paid him with a good
freehold grant for his leasehold?the source of so much enmity?now
happily cancelled. His stock at the same time are safer on the
grass than they have been for years, and they can only be moved by
the legal notice of the Land Board.


Three-fourths of his troubles have been dispelled, and no other
conceivable legislation can do for him more than this measure.
The selector, when an honest man, earned his bread by the
sweat of his brow. His freehold had to be snatched, as it were,
through the fire, and his leasehold was a constant cause of contest
and little else. Now he may sit under his vine and fig -tree, with
none to make him afraid, and with four times as much land as he
could formerly call his own, all under easy terms of payment.
For new settlers we have holdings ready of all sizes, from the
villager?s lot of two acres to the grazing freehold of 6000, procurable
on condition of residence, fencing, the payment of a survey fee on
entrance, and a moderate feu-rent thereafter ; and we have at least
half of each run in reserve still unsurveyed for settlement.
We have substituted administration on the spot for Sydnev
officialism. We have Land Boards that know every creek, everv
paddock, and every settler within their territories, and active, open
inspection is substituted for the back-stairs and jacketing work of
former times.
The warrant of the Commissioner will shift grass-stealers, in-
terdict trespassers, or fit them with handcuffs, and dummies and
land sharks are beginning to find that honest work pays best. The
drove roads are kept as permanent reserves, and with the State
forests and water reservations are under the management of the
Land Boards.
We are moreover in receipt of a permanent land revenue in no
way depending on the caprice of land speculation, or the good will of
banks, so lightly does it press on individuals. The half belonging to
the general revenue promises to he of an amount that, according to
past experience, could hardly he trusted safely to our Parliament, but
no doubt the legislators who pass the Act will maintain a higher
standard of duty and intelligence than their predecessors. The other
portions remaining in each Territory may form germs from which in
time may grow in our inland wastes the fruits of national life, civic
independence, and public duty ; perchance in time to ring the knell
of ? log rolling ? and the great ? Cheater ? policy. Local revenue
may no doubt he applied by a local body on the ? agin our gate ?
principle, but it would be done in the teeth of a watchful and sus-
picious press and people.
The gross revenue from the ten Central Territories alone with


alienation completed, under the feu-rent could not be rated lower
than �700,000. What it might be when the same method was
extended over all our western country, and over the unsold lands on
the coast, we cannot guess, hut we know this much?the policy of
the Act would tend to work out all problems of*' climate and soil
through that best of all solvents, the charm of the freeholder?s title.
Through the same charm?an undeniable hold on the land?new
industries would be tapped. Security has given us leisure and
means to begin work in our paddocks and orchards.
The department in Sydney receives duplicates of all surveys and
reports from the various Land Boards, and the head-quarters staff
are engaged in compiling most compendious and valuable statistical
summaries from these records. Moreover, on inquiry at the office in
Bridge-street, information on all matters, both general and local, can
he got at once now the muddle of Centralization is dissipated, hut
all applications as to specific business are courteously passed on to
the proper Land Boards.
No such permanent or sterling results could arise under Centra-
lization. The most enduring fruits of the abrogated law promise to
he huge grazing estates in certain quarters, these being chiefly in the
position of assets held by one hank to change only to some other.
The proprietor who clears out with profit on the periodical rise of
prices, leaves his successor in the irons, and it takes a long term of
depression to await the next turn of the wheel and cook up another
fortune for an unknown man who is to rise on the wasted resources
of three predecessors.
Meantime, the men who start under the new law, whatever
prices may rule, can live well and increase the intrinsic value of their
properties. They have got their legs under them firmly without
having incurred the responsibilities of station buyers.
Centres of culture and intelligence begin to spot the pastoral
wastes. Hundreds of families are feeling their way to the plains and
forests where ready openings have been prepared for them ?where
hardy enterprise and healthy family life will alike find scope.
As the periodical literature of the Colonies, of America, and
Europe, spreads among these new landholders, rural knowledge goes
abroad, and experiments are tried. The grasses of Asia and
America, the hillside and meadow irrigation of Lombardy, the tree-
culture of France and Germany, the cottage tillage of the Channel


Islands and Belgium, all become known, and open new branches of
labour?some bringing immediate profit, some giving cheap food and
cheap luxuries, some tending to the good of future generations, and
all contributing homely comfort, rural beauty, and daily pleasure
to those who adopt them.
These are some of the results that are possible from the working
of the proposed Act.
But there is no royal road to success in legislation. The best
law that was ever framed depends for its success, not on the letter of
its text, but on the good faith of those by whom it is administered,
A corrupt people will certainly produce corrupt representatives,
whether they are members of a Legislature or members of a Land
Board.
They, whose chosen leaders have thriven in mining rigs, and
successful insolvencies?in usury and grog-selling?can hardly but
act after their kind. But they do not yet form the heart of the
nation. That, if still sound, will sooner or later echo the note of
common sense and humanity.
Meantime, as things are, the social aspect of our colonization is
more depressing than any other. Misspent wealth, wasted resources,
and industries obstructed, are bad enough, but human nature driven
into false channels, with the baser elements dominating over all that
tends to worth or kindliness, is much worse. Such has been the
leading feature of our system for long.
From every side appear symptoms that?whether we look to the
financial side of squatting, or the aggressive aspect of selection?
show a lower scale of life and motive always rising to the surface.
For long the squatter has been hustled out, a prey to sham tenure
and sham finance, to make way for the money-lender and stock-
jobber ; while selection gives evidence everywhere of concentrating
within its action the discontent, the sloth, and hereditary hatred of
every discordant faction. What a weapon for the Socialist or Fenian
is the selection law ! It prompts him to glut his hatred. He may
not want the land, it is true ; but he can make it hot for those
whom his perverted instincts paint as enemies, and he can make
money out of them.
Is this a power that Government should place in the hands of
any man ? Wherever selection is at work, whether as the weapon
of the professional land shark, the dummy, or the small crawling


cockatoo settler, with his half-acre fenced in, and his starred cows
eating everybody?s grass, there is a diseased element of social hatred
and inherited discontent apparent.
Worth, liberality, kindliness, and good nature make their pos-
sessors the natural prey of the predaceous races bred by the law.
The natural opponent fit to cope with the encroaching selector is the
iron-fisted statiowmonger, the man with enormous domains who
never hesitates to trample out his fellow-creatures like reptiles.
But, is this humanity or civilization ? What a tone of human
feeling is thus engendered !
The hard, the unscrupulous, the fierce and greedy alone can
bold their ground,?while those who believe in justice and mercy
are as lambs among social wolves.
On one of our table lands, in a poor wintry country, there lives
a lady, the widow of one of our early settlers. No great proprietress
is she, but merely owner of one of the grants of the days of Sir
Thomas Brisbane, with a few pre-emptive sections round her paddock
fences, on which she fed a few flocks of sheep. Many deeds of kind-
ness did she and her family, till her beneficence brought round her by
degrees the helpless, the poor, and the worthless, all clinging together
with true vagrant instinct. Selection came on?they had picked up
a few cows?they were waxing fat, and of course?kicked. They
hemmed her in under the Irav? they studied the clauses read aloud
to them by the scholar of the community, and they made up their
minds that they had her. They do as they please?they
pull down her fences when they want more grass ; and } - et when in
trouble they fawn and beg to her the same as ever. If a woman or
child is sick, they knock her up at night, and she goes through rain
and darkness to take them medicine and advice. Yet their encroach-
ments and depredations do not abate. There is withal a covert
threat always in the back ground.
When the breaking of the fences is complained of a hint of the
firestick comes out, neither unintelligible nor vain. One sometimes .
hears of a shed or a mile of fencing in the neighbourhood being burnt
accidentally after some assertion of right that has been disapproved
of.
Can anyone follow the crazy, perverted reasoning of such minds ?
The mendicant?s whine, and the curse against the u swell ? and the
? squatter ? come equally volubly from the same lips. The ? land-


lord? seems to such people to be, in some form or other, a necessary
institution. They need somebody to fawn to and to rob?to beg
from when sick or suffering ; and to burn out, or, perhaps, shoot at,
under the promptings of their hereditary genius.
Many who read this will laugh at the helplessness which does
not deal with this piracy, while law and money are at command.
Too well is it known what would be the verdict of a jury of selectors
if a case could be got up.
Our thoughts are that shame and humiliation should rest on
our heads who support institutions that leave a Christian woman at
the mercy of such human vermin.
But it is too true that this is only one side of the feud. Pages
might be written on the heartless arrogance and unprincipled greed
displayed on the other side.
One turns away in shame at times from a system which brings
out only the filth of human nature.
The chasm between interests is too great, or rather there should
be no chasm. Let it be bridged over for the sake of all that is
honest.
Our social system lacks sadly some healing element, something
containing more of the spirit of humanity and less of the beast of
prey. We want that which will live in honest industry and delight
in good neighbourship, cherishing the one great ambition to rear the
young in integrity, good-will, and mental culture ; but there is no
place among us for people of this stamp till we change our ways.
The aspect of our Inland Districts presents only too faithful a
counterpart of our condition as a people. The over-stocked blighted
pastures, the wretched filthy roadside pothouses, the squalor and
solitude everywhere prevalent?for the wealth of the country never
stays or bears fruit where it is produced. Comfort there is none.
Family life there is little. All tells of the land feud?of a people
encamped, not settled?of a country, the riches of which build banks,
and swell advertisements,but, as it is, not fit to live in.


CHAPTER IX.
All sorts of nuisances, from foul drains to bushranging, seem ot
give birth to vested interests in some shape or other.
An attempt to abate the stench of a reeking fetid gutter, not
long ago, raised the wrath of a thriving manufacturer to boiling
pitch. From his point of view the proposed purification involved
ruin to all industrial enterprise.
In like manner, some years ago, the inhabitants of a southern
township became touchingly pathetic over their vanished profits,
when their local crop of highway-men was at last gleaned up by cord
and bullet, and a strong body of police, that had been engaged in
the work, with a corresponding expenditure, was withdrawn from the
neighbourhood.
For similar reasons the support to things as they are, and the
opposition to such a scheme of land reform as that suggested, may
be expected to be widespread, powerful, and loudly expressed. By
some the direct fruits of anarchy and misgovernment are highly
prized, while with others, the vis inertia ?? ?the inside fat that gathers
from ease and plenty?impedes respiration, forbids movement, and
suspends thought.
Many diverse strands of influence thus favor the status quo.
Few people have the leisure, or will be troubled, to look into the
pros and cons of disputed questions, and whatever brings in ready
money and fills the channels of daily traffic is naturally to the
majority ? the right thing.?
In this way there come together the materials for forming a
? Conservative? party?not altogether unlike that which turned out
the last Whig Government at home and welcomed back the Tories.
All ? established respectabilities ? in the mother country joined
in opposition to the ? reckless reform ? which threatened them with
purgation.
The right to adulterate butter and whisky, the sacredness of
rents derived from disorderly houses and diseased back-slums, com-
bined those interested in enthusiastic union with the devotees of the
Athanasian Creed and the upholders of sectarian ignorance, and
liberalism in England was sent to roost.
In New South Wales, the most powerful, and probably the least
respectable section of our Tory party, is formed of the ? professional
politicians.?


Their views possess the one advantage of being easily under-
stood. These are quite free from all mistiness, theory, or sentiment;
and indeed, are not to be distinguished from the principles put
forward on a noted occasion by the silversmiths of Ephesus? for by
politics they make their living.
For years they have thriven on a centralized system, of which
the very life-blood has been drained from the country that local
government will release from such operation,?and through the influ-
ence of their votes, the administration of every department has been
directed for the behoof of their handicraft and mystery?the trade of
politics.
Every question has been kept on the balance, so that the dip of
the beam to the one side or the other may hinge on the favour of the
? House,? and thus keep up the value of votes ; and many enact-
ments have for the same reason been constructed and worded, so that
they might, when necessary, be read more ways than one.
Thus, to the great advantage of the profession, squatter has been
played against selector ?ecclesiastic against secularist?the North
against the South?every town and every district against those
adjoining ; and all has tended to confusion worse confounded?to
enormous increase of revenue and corresponding waste?to a great
crowding of population to the capital to shout for more Government
mon ey?already freely spent among the friends of the members, but
still far short of the demand.
Such is the state of things our politicians rejoice in.
They have good reason to fear the inauguration of local govern-
ment and the solution of the land problem, and they will oppose
both tooth and nail.
This ? Conservative? section must be classed as irreconcilable ;
but being as they are?quite unprincipled, habitually inconsistent,
and eminently economical of truth ?they are not worth reconciling,
and argument on them would be simply wasted.
Our scheme, if brought forward, would he accused by them of
trying to destroy both pastoral and agricultural industry, and the
want of grass as well as the falling off of* the land revenue, would,
without hesitation, he laid at the doors of its supporters.
If those strove to explain the operation of pastoral freeholds or
of village commonages, they would immediately he accused of trying
to stop the cultivation of wheat, and the nonsensical howl would be


re-echoed till such as knew no better would begin to think that there
was something in it.
The commutation of the squatting lease would, on the other
hand, he roared down as a fraud on both the squatter and the ? poor
man,? and long columns of figures would be read aloud in confirma-
tion, perhaps taken from Government offices, but intelligible neither
to the compiler, to the Premier, nor to anyone else.
But we know, from the recollection of what has taken place in
political tours during the recess, that all this kind of thing goes
down and is cheered to the rafters, so long as road and bridge grants,
billets, and pickings are dangled before the audience.
Every blatant falsity, though answered and refuted, would turn
up again and again, and would be paraded as a fresh discovery?a
newly found mare?s nest. So much for our politicians. Reform has
only one chance against them, and its value is not yet tested. It
must be sought for in the common sense and honesty of the people.
The Volunteer land orders again do their part in strengthening
our ? Conservative ? phalanx.
A more humiliating record of corrupt administration than the
history of these same orders it would be difficult to find.
Our Volunteer force, when first embodied, asked for no recom-
pense, and there is no evidence that the idea was ever mooted till
the Administration of the day included the clause in the Act of 18G7
which granted fifty acres of land to each volunteer after five years?
service. Still, under the Act as originally passed, it seems to have
been intended merely that the land-orders should only be available
under the conditions of the existing land law, and that they should
be received simply as payment for fifty acres at the current price.
But as votes became valuable, concession seems to have followed con-
cession. The orders were finally made unconditional and transfer-
able, and thus a separate land law in their favour came in a certain
sense to supersede and over-ride existing enactments, and consequently
they become very valuable as weapons to resist selection.
Any one unaccustomed to our political habits would think that
there was a recklessness and inconsistency in thus stultifying the
land policy of the country, but those who know the ways of our
representatives, who have studied the great ? Cheater? policy, and
have observed the gyrations of the ins and outs, can in this case, as
in the celebrated 31st clause, and elsewhere, recognize at once the


statesmanship which the people of New South Wales have delighted
to honour.
The late Act purports to restrain the further issue of these land
orders, but practically, as will yet be seen, there can be no limit
except that which will involve the extinction of our Defence force.
The volunteers are already diminished to one-half of their original
number, and recruiting cannot be successfully carried on under a law
which will place the young members in a less advantageous position
than their predecessors.
Some two hundred thousand acres of the public lands have by
the operation of the same law been alienated, in a way of all others
the most damaging to the public estate, and the most obstructive to
a fair solution of the land question.
We might safely challenge Bedlam and Newgate combined to
devise a more effectual method of doing national mischief?and it
was not done by one side of the ? House,? but by both?the Ins
bidding against the Outs ?and their opponents, in their turn, going
another step beyond to bid for votes, seats, pay, and plunder.
Looking at these transactions, as faithfully detailed in the
records of the colony, one is led to ask?Are these things told really
of educated human beiqgs ? or, are they not rather malicious traves-
ties of some of .ZEsop?s fables, in which the actors are apes and
magpies ?
Our ? Conservative? party still would not be complete without
the squatter, or whoever for the time may represent him. We cannot
avoid remarking that he might be in better company.
The days are long past since an ?interest? took the place of a.
marked typical class in occupying the waste lands of the Crown*
With the development of the financial element, the personality of
the order has of late years become more fluid and at times shadowy.
Year after year the fabric of the ?pastoral interest? becomes
more artificial and unintelligible.
With all that can be said of the intelligence and enterprise dis-
played, the squatting system as a whole is marked throughout with
failure. It is based on false principles of economy. It operates
generally as prejudicially to the ostensible owners as to the public
welfare. It is hollow and pretentious?a trap for small capitalists
and new comers. Squatting, some people say, is the base of our
national well-being. It would be more correct to say that it occu-


pies the ground which might otherwise be differently used under a
sound grazing tenure, as it systematically destroys the national pas-
tures under the plea of protecting the ? pastoral interest.?
The usual climax arrives periodically, when the money power
habitually uses the deposits of the banks?the national savings?to
eat up two-thirds of the squatters, and equally, as at present, to
trample out every attempt at settlement. This happens nearly every
ten years.
But with all this admitted, squatters will still, as a body, be
prepared to resist any attempt at reform. They have ever been
noted for their blindness and inability to read the lessons of experience.
Under the squatting lease each individual tenant seems inevitably to
adopt the idea that his run is his own?not merely the grass but
also the land, and that whatever may happen to other squatters,
;such can hardly fall to his lot ; till, in his turn, bitter experience
drifts him, as it has drifted many?between the Scylla and Charybdis
of mortgage and selection?to his ruin ; to blight his hopes, and
prove past remedy that his house also was built upon the sand.
Nevertheless, whether acceptable or not to the squatting body,
the commutation suggested, or some kindred scheme, must be
adopted unless we would perpetuate the strife and chaos of past
years. To those outside the interest the benefits of the change
cannot be for a moment doubtful.
The ? Land Law of the Future? would compound all squatting
rights and wrongs for that which is sound in itself, safe for all other
interests, intelligible to every one, and secure from invasion or
intrigue.
It would at the same time release the public territory from the
incubus of a tenure which at one time seems to melt away into a
shadowy tenancy-at-will, and under other influences hardens into an
iron monopoly.
Moreover, it would practically realise results which have been
hitherto pronounced incongruous and impracticable. It would
provide the most absolute security for carrying on grazing, and
would at the same time found and maintain substantial settlement.
But there are more irreconcilahles yet. However, one other
will be quite enough.
The ? poor man?s friend ? will, in spite of all that has come
.and gone, insist upon a ? poor man?s paradise of small farms,? or


more properly speaking, he will object to there being any large pro-
prietors. All that can be said on this score is, that the plan pro-
posed has been kept within the bounds of possibility, as proved by
the previous history of the colony. We can deal only with the
resources of the country as they are, and in conformity with the
instincts of the people.
If anyone wants to see an example of land legislation strin-
gently framed in the interest of the ? poor man,? let him look at
Victoria, the native home of selection, dummying, and land-sharking
?now the scene of all other colonies, of huge, uninhabited pastoral
estates.
Let it be understood, that what we require in the national
interest, is not to extirpate the large proprietor, but to found a
system which will encourage the growth of landholders of all sorts,
and to endeavour by beneficent and honest legislation to attract good
people of all grades.
If the compensation granted to the squatter on cancellation of
his lease is objected to for the reason that Parliament has power to
cancel the lease at any time, we may answer, that Parliament has
power to repudiate any other obligation.
Squatting property has been called into life by enactment, and
under this enactment every sale and purchase made has received the
national guarantee.
There is in this respect no difference between squatting and
freehold property. If resumed by enactment, compensation, in every
equitable sense, must be given.
There is yet a stronger reason in favour of commutation. The
Volunteer Land Orders and Improvement Purchases which now close
the best of every run against the public, have by their use, vindicated
in an undeniable fashion, the squatter?s possession of his country.
These purchases are the necessary and justifiable counterpart of the
destructive law of selection, and are equally legal.
It is only by such a measure as will disentangle the public terri-
tory from those complications that justice can be done to all sides,
and the future welfare of the colony can be_ made possible.
If we can make it understood, as we claim to have proved, that
there is enough land for all, and for ten times the number if rationally
dealt with?if the seed can be sown which may yet take root and
bloom in peace, goodwill, industry, and contentment, all other things


that we value may be expected to follow, and we shall find that all
have gained much and lost nothing, when we have swept into the
dust-bin of the past, the frauds and follies?the sham legislation and
real rascallity of 1877.
CHAPTEE X.
But all suggestions as to land reform simply amount to ? flogging
the dead horse,? till the due time and season arrives.
If we may judge by certain forecastings, the shadow is already
on the dial, and the signs of the coming cataclysm are in the air.
Whether the final strain comes from ? drought,? ? finance,? or
? politics,? as the immediate cause, all who know our habits and
history can recognise the fact that we have just completed the
erection of one of those wondrous structures of paper credit and com-
mercial gas which we have been in the habit of calling ? prosperity,?
We did the same ten years ago, and we have done it worse this
time. The structure then set up fell with a crash. Ours is already
top-heavy.
T1 ic letter in the Herald of the 4th instant, written by the most
experienced financier in Australia?especially in its concluding para-
graphs, ought to serve as a beacon to our busy politicians and rulers.
? But wisdom crieth in the street and no man regardeth.? As well
pour water on a duck?s back.
Still the facts indicated by Mr. Walker will be found to have
a practical meaning, and it may be as well to endeavour to estimate
their consequences.
The first symptom then will be, the decrease and falling off of
the land revenue. This is already in progress.
The second will be necessarily the calling up of the surplus by
the Government from the banks.
The third?the inevitable link in the chain?will be the calling
O
in of bank advances.
lo summarise consequences that are too harrowing to follow in
detail ; the colony woidd be forced to face taxation with all her main


industries paralysed?with her best lands unpeopled, desolate, and
held as forfeited pawn pledges by the banks ; ?and with a population
that has been spoiled for wholesome self-helping exertion by being
pampered for years by a profuse and corrupting outlay of the public
money.
When these things come to pass,'then the public will have
plenty of leisure to study the land question, and with this end in
view, I close my remarks for the present by following a suggestion
received from a gentleman the other day?in condensing into a few
lines the drift and intent of ? The Land Law of the Future.?
Taking as formerly Candowan station, 240,000 acres, for illustra-
tion ;?Under the present law, it is occupied by the lessee and nineteen
selectors ; the lessee holds 210,000 acres leasehold, and 17,000 free-
hold ; in all 227,000 acres ; the selectors hold 13,000 acres con-
ditional purchase.
The 17,000 acres freehold belonging to the lessee consist chiefly
of improvement and Volunteer land order purchases. The selector?s
grazing rights have been effectually cut off by some twenty-five
Volunteer land orders.
The improvement purchases have in like manner secured all the
best positions and frontages, and now there is hardly space over the
whole run on which a selector could find a spot to sit down.
At the same time this operation has cost the lessee dear. These
17,000 acres freehold represent a burden on the station of about
�30,000, a cost entailed entirely by the encroachments of selectors.
Two years ago two selectors took up, under the Act of 1875 (as
soon as it passed), 640 acres each in the lessee?s lambing paddock,
and they drove in among the ewes lambing there 2500 other ewes.
They managed to spoil the lambing, and were bought out for heavy
sums.
Now, look at the result of all this.
1. None of the selectors have managed to secure their pre-
emptives or grazing rights, without which, selections are compara-
tively worthless.
2. The lessee has been caused great .expense and loss ; he has
for the time escaped the selectors ?but it is only to incur the equal
danger of a heavy mortgage.
3. The whole area of the run is spoiled for the occupation of
future settlers.


Now, ? the Land Law of the Future ? proposes to do as follows:
1. To hand over the administration of the lands to local bodies
called Land Boards.
2. These Land Boards to hold in trust the public territory, and
apportion it fairly for the benefit of three interests?the squatter or
lessee, the selector, and the future settler.
3. Each squatter would receive in lieu of his squatting lease a
grant of a certain area, according to valuation ; and all improvement,.
Volunteer land order, and other scattered purchases would be can-
celled.
4. Each selector would receive on application an area equal to
four times that of his selection in lieu of his present holding, on con-
dition of fencing in and paying a perpetual rent of 6d. per acre per
annum.
5. For the wants of future settlers, an area equal to one tenth
of each original run would be always ready surveyed in areas of all
sizes up to 6000 acres.
6. These farms and homesteads would be acquired by paying a
deposit at the rate of �lO for every area up to 500 acres, and �lO
for every other 500 acres, or portion of 500 acres, also an annual
perpetual rent of 6d. per acre per annum ; fencing in with a sub-
stantial fence, and residence.
7. Open, honest, supervision by the Land Board would see that-
all conditions were fulfilled.
8. The unsold lands would remain in the hands of the Land
Board, and the lessee?s stock would remain on the grass subject to-
the discretion of the Board till the lands were wanted for survey and
settlement.
Now what would be the effect of this on Candowan ? Compare'
the following figures with those above ?240,000 acres.
Grant to lessee on commutation ... ... ??? 56,780 acres.
Grants to selectors ... 52,000 ~
Remaining for survey and settlement, formerly
spoiled by Volunteer land orders and im-
provement purchases, now vested in the
Land Board ... ... ... ... ... 131,220 ~
Now which plan is best for tire country, best for the selector,.
and best for the squatter ?
