Air ?Dandy Jim.
The Turkish Bath, the Turkish Bath,
The Turkish Bath, Ma?am, if you please,
The Turkish Bath?s the only path
Where accouchements are done with ease.
I went to bathe the usual day,
Had been shampooed, and at my ease,
When some one shouted in dismay,
Saying, ? Oh! my Giod 1 it?s Dominie?s!?
I ran to see, like many more,
(Excuse the picture, if you please ;)
But what I saw upon the floor,
I?m certain sure was Dominie?s 1
Though many say, our jovial friend,
Who manages the Bath and Fees,
By some means lent a helping hand,
To bring the girl upon her knees.
Sometimes Repentance comes too late,
Through Pardon?s gate it?s hard to squeeze,
But thiSj reluctant, I must slate,
? My God ! Oh God ! it?s Dominie?s !?
