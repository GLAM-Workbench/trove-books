169 Self-Recording Hygrometer, on same principle as above
instruments, with ruled papers for 12 months £7 10 0
These instruments register automatically with ink upon a
ruled paper chart attached to a vertical cylinder, revolved
for 7 days by means of a clockwork inside. The fluctua-
tions of atmospheric pressure and temperature act upon
vacuum chambers, connected by an exceedingly simple
mechanical contrivance to a long lever arm carrying the
pen, by which a magnified diagram is produced upon the
paper on the cylinder of the rise and fall of the baro-
metric column or temperature. These papers are ruled
to represent inches and tenths of the mercurial
Barometer Scale and degrees (Fahrenheit) respectively.
The Hygrometer acting on the same principle records
the percentage of moisture.

registering successively 100, 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000
revolutions ... .. ... ... ... £5 0 0
In this arrangemeut the cups travel at the rate of one-third
of the winds velocity, and each revolution represents
3T4 feet; thus 314 x 3=9 - 42 ft., being the distance
travelled by the wind for each revolution. This multi-
plied by the number of revolutions indicated on the
dial, shows the distance the wind has travelled between
one observation and another.
178 Air Meter, or Pocket Anemometer, for Mines, Hospitals.
Sewers, &c. ... ... ... ... ... £5 5 0
The indications are obtained by the revolution of a series
of fans, acting first on a long hand, capable of recording
the low velocity of 50 ft. per minute on the large dial
divided to 100 ft., and then successively by a train of
wheels on the indices of five smaller dials, each divided
into 10 parts, and recording respectively 1,000, 10,000,
100,000, up to 10,000,000 ft.
