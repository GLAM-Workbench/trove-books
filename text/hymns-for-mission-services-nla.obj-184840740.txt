I A FEW more years shall roll,
-tx A few more seasons come,
And we shall be with those that rest
Asleep within the tomb :
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that great day ;
O wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.
2 A few more suns shall set
O’er these dark hills of time,
And we shall be where suns are not,
A far serener clime :
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that blest day ;
O wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.
3 A few more storms shall beat
On this wild rocky shore,
And we shall be where tempests cease,
And surges swell no more :
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that calm day ;
O wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.


4 A few more struggles here,
A few more partings o’er,
A few more toils, a few more tears,
And we shall weep no more :
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that bright day ;
O wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away.
5 ’Tis but a little while
■ And He shall come again,
Who died that we might live, Who lives
That we with Him may reign:
Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that glad day ;
O wash me in Thy precious Blood,
And take my sins away. Amen.

1 A LL hail the power of Jesu’s name !
Let angels prostrate fall ;
Bring forth the Royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.
2 Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,
Who from His altar call ;
Extol the stem of Jesse’s Rod,
And crown Him Lord of all.
3 Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,
A remnant weak and small ;
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all. ’
4 Ye Gentile sinners, ne’er forget
The wormwood and the gall;
Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.


5 Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.
6 Oh ! that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall ;
There join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all. Amen.
L.M.—Old Hundredth,
1 ALL people that on earth do dwell,
. Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice ;
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
2 The Lord, ye know, is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make :
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
3 O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto ;
Praise, laud, and bless His Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
4 For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
5 To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God Whom Heaven and earth adore,
From men and from the angel-host,
Be praise and glory evermore. Amen.

I A RT thou weary, art thou languid,
/\ Art thou sore distress’d ?
“ Come to me,” saith One, “ and coming,
Be at rest.”
2 Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my Guide ?
“ In His feet and hands are wound-prints,
And His side.”
3 Is there diadem, as Monarch,
That His brow adorns ?
“ Yea, a crown, in very surety,
But of thorns,”
4 If I find Him, if I follow,
What His guerdon here ?
“ Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Many a tear.”
S If I still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last?
“ Sorrow vanquish’d, labour ended,
Jordan pass’d.”
6 If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay ?
“ Not till earth, and not till heaven
Pass away,”
7 Finding, following, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless ? _
“ Angels, Martyrs, Prophets, Virgins
Answer, Yes.” Amen,

Comforter Divine !
2We are sinful; cleanse us, Lord :

Lost, until by Thee restored,
Comforter Divine !
3 Orphan are our souls, and poor;
Give us from Thy heavenly store,
Faith, love, joy, for evermore,
Comforter Divine !

Bear us up the starry road
To the height of Thine abode,
Comforter Divine ! Amen.

Come to the Saviour, make no delay ;
Here in His Word He’s shown us the way ;
Here in our midst He’s standing to-day,
Tenderly saying “ Come ! ”
Chorus.
Joyful, joyful, will the meeting be,
When from sin our hearts are pure and free ;
And we shall gather, Saviour, with Thee,
In our eternal home.


“ Suffer the children! ” Oh, hear His voice,
Let every heart leap forth and rejoice,
And let us freely make Him our choice ;
Do not delay, but come.
Joyful, &c.
Think once again, He’s with us to-day ;
Heed now His blest commands, and obey ;
Hear now His accents tenderly say,
“ Will you, my children, come ? ”
Joyful, &c.

I /"■* O bury thy sorrow,
The world hath its share ;
Go bury it deeply,
Go hide it with care :
Go think of it calmly,
When curtain’d by night,
Go tell it to Jesus,
And all will be right.
2 Go tell it to Jesus,
He knoweth thy grief;
Go tell it to Jesus,
He’ll send thee relief:
Go gather the sunshine
He sheds on the way ;
He’ll lighten thy burden—•
Go, weary one, pray.
3 Hearts growing a-weary
With heavier woe
Now droop ’mid the darkness—
Go comfort them, go !
Go bury thy sorrows,
Let others be blest ;
Go give them the sunshine,
Tell Jesus the rest. Amen.


i f'OD the Father seen of none,
vJ God the Sole-begotten Son,
God the Spirit, with Them One,
Spare us, Holy Trinity.
2 Jesu, Who for us didst bear
Scorn and sorrow, toil and care,
Hearken to our lowly prayer ;
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
3 By that hour of agony,
Spent while Thine Apostles three
Slumbered in Gethsemane :
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
4 By those sad rebuking Eyes,
Moving Peter’s tears and sighs,
When he had denied Thee thrice
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
5 By the scourging Thou hast borne,
By the purple robe of scorn,
By the reed and crown of thorn ;
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
6 By Thy going forth to die,
When they raised their wicked cry,
“ Crucify Him, Crucify ! ”
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
7 By the Cross which Thou didst bear,
By the cup they bade Thee share,
Mingled gall and vinegar ;
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
8 By Thy nailing to the tree,
By the title over Thee,
By the gloom of Calvary :
Hear us, Holy Jesu.


9 By Thy Seven Words then said,
By the bowing of Thy Head,
By Thy numbering with the dead !
Hear us, Holy Jesu.
lo By the Piercing of Thy Side,
By the stream of double tide,
Blood and water, thence supplied :
Hear us, Holy Jesu,
I x When temptation sore is rife,
When we faint amidst the strife,
Thou, Whose death hath been our life :
Save us, Holy Jesu.
12 So, with hope in Thee made fast,
When death’s bitterness is past,
We may see Thy Face at last !
Save us, Holy Jesu ! Amen.

1 LORY be to Jesus,
V_J Who, in bitter pains,
Poured for me the life-blood
From His sacred veins !
2 Grace and life eternal
In that Blood I find :
Blest be His compassion
Infinitely kind !
3 Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torments
Did the world redeem !
4 Abel’s blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies ;
But the Blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.


5 Oft as it is sprinkled
On our guilty hearts,
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck departs ;
6 Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel-hosts rejoicing
Make their glad reply.
7 Lift ye then your voices,
Swell the mighty flood ;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious Blood. Amen.
Sankey.
HO ! My comrades, see the signal
Waving in the sky !
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh !
Chorus.
“ Hold the fort, for I am coming,”
Jesus signals still :
Wave the answer back to Heaven,—
“ By Thy grace we will.”
See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on ;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone :
Hold the fort, &c.
See the glorious banner waving,
Hear the trumpet blow,
In our Leader’s name we’ll triumph
Over every foe.
Hold the fort, &c.


4 Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near ;
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer !
Hold the fort, &c. Amen.
D.C.M.— 317, A. & M.
i T HEARD the voice of Jesus say
■*- “ Come unto Me and rest ;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast : ”
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad ;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.
2 I heard the voice of Jesus say
“ Behold, I freely give
The living water, thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live : ”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream ;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.
3 I heard the voice of Jesus say
“ I am this dark world’s Light ;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright : ”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun ;
And in that Light of life I’ll walk
Till travelling days are done. Amen.
D. 7,6,7,6, —67, Bateman & Inglis.
I T LAY my sins on JESUS,
The spotless Lamb of God ;
He bears them all and frees us
From this accursed load.


I bring my guilt to JESUS, _
To wash my crimson stains _
White in His Blood most precious,
Till not a spot remains.
I bring my wants to J ESUS ;
All fulness dwells in Him ;
He heals all my diseases, —
He doth my soul redeem,
I lay my griefs on JESUS,
My burdens and my cares ;
He from them all releases, —
He all my sorrow shares.
I long to be like Jesus,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild ;
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father’s holy child.
I long to be with Jesus,
Amid the heavenly throng,
And sing with saints His praises,—
To learn the angels’ song. Amen.
Sankey,
I T LEFT it all with JESUS
A Long ago;
All my sins I brought Him,
And my woe.
When by faith I saw Him
On the tree,
Heard His small still whisper,
“ ’Tis for thee,”
From my heart the burden
Roll’d away—
Happy day!
From my heart the burden
Roll’d away—
Happy day!


2 I leave it all with Jesus
For He knows
Flow to steal the bitter
From life’s woes ;
How to gild the tear-drop
With His smile,
Make the desert garden
Bloom awhile:
When my weakness leaneth
On His might,
All seems light;
When my weakness leaneth
On His might,
All seems light
3 I leave it all with Jesus,
Day by day ;
Faith can firmly trust Him
Come what may.
Hope has dropp’d her anchor.
Found her rest
In the calm sure haven
Of His breast:
Love esteems it heaven
To abide
At His side;
Love esteems it heaven
To abide
At His side.
4 Oh, leave it all with Jesus,
Drooping soul J
Tell not half thy story
But the whole.
Worlds on worlds are hanging,
On His hand,
Life and death are waiting
His command;


Vet His tender Bosom
Makes thee room—
Oh, come home!
Yet His tender Bosom
Makes thee room —
Oh, come home! Amen,
J/J. P.M.—BB, Bateman & Inglfs,
I T UST as I am, without one plea
I But that Thy Blood was shed for me,
‘'And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come !
2 Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee whose Blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come!
3 Just as I am, though tost about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come !
4 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind,
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come !
5 Just as I am. Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve !
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come I
6 Just as I am, (Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down,)
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come !
Amen,


jg 8,7,8,7, —F. A. Packer.
i TESUS calls us, o’er the tumult
J Of our life’s wild restless sea,
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
Saying, “ Christian, follow Me.”
2 As, of old, St. Andrew heard it
By the Galilean lake,
Turn’d from home, and toil, and kindred,
Leaving all for His dear sake.
3 Jesus calls us —from the worship
Of the vain world’s golden store,
From each idol that would keep us —
Saying, “Christian, love Me more.”
4 In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil, and hours of ease,
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
“ Christian, love Me more than these.”
5 J ESUS calls us—By Thy mercies,
Saviour, may we hear Thy call,
Give our hearts to Thy obedience,
Serve and love Thee best of all. Amen.
10 8,7,8,7,4,7. —Helmsley.
I T O! He comes! with clouds descending,
-L* Once for favour’d sinners slain,
Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of His train :
Hallelujah !
Mortals ! catch their joyful strain.
2 Every eye shall now behold Him,
Robed in dreadful majesty ;
Those who set at nought and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,
Deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.


3 Blest redemption, long expected !
See ! His solemn pomp to share,
All His saints, by man rejected,
Rise to meet Him in the air ;
Hallelujah !
See ! the Son of God is there.
4 Yea, Amen ! let all adore Thee,
High on Thine eternal throne :
Saviour, worlds bow down before Thee,
Claim the kingdoms for Thine own.!
Hallelujah !
Come and make Thy glories known.
Amen.
Sankey.
I T ORD, I hear of showers of blessing
' Thou art scattering full and free ;
Showers the thirsty land refreshing :
Let some droppings fall on me,
Even me.
2 Pass me not, O gracious Father !
Sinful though my heart may be ; f
Thou might’st curse me, but the rather
Let Thy mercy light on me,
Even me.
3 Pass me not, O tender Saviour !
Let me love and cling to Thee ;
I am longing for Thy favour ;
When Thou comest, call for me,
Even me.
4 Pass me not, O mighty Spirit !
Thou canst make the blind to see ;
Witnesser of Jesu’s merit,
Speak the word of power to me,
Even me.


5 Love of God, so pure and changeless,
Blood of Christ, so rich and free,
Grace of God, so strong and boundless,
Magnify them all in me,
Even me. Amen,
7) 6 .7>6 (D)- —142, A. & M.
I BROTHERS, lift your voices,
W Triumphant songs to raise ;
Till heaven on high rejoices,
And earth is filled with praise.
Ten thousand hearts are bounding
With holy hopes and free ;
The Gospel trump is sounding,
The trump of Jubilee.
2 O Christian brothers, glorious
Shall be the conflict’s close :
The Cross hath been victorious, j
And shall be o’er its foes.
Faith is our battle-token :
Our Leader all controls ;
Our trophies, fetters broken ;
Our captives, ransom’d souls.
3 Not unto us, —Lord Jesus,
To Thee, all praise be due :
Whose blood-bought mercy frees us,
Has freed our brethren too.
Not unto us, —in glory
The angels catch the strain,
And cast their crowns before Thee]
Exultingly again.
4 Captain of our salvation,
Thy presence we adore :
Praise, glory, adoration
Be Thine for evermore.


Still on in conflict pressing
On Thee Thy people call,
Thee King of kings confessing,
Thee crowning Lord of all. Amen.
P.M, —132, Bateman & Inglis,
I by one we cross the river,
V_/ One by one we’re passing o’er ;
One by one the crowns are given.
On the bright and happy shore.
Youth and childhood oft are passing
O’er the dark and rolling tide,
And the blessed holy Spirit
Is the dying Christian’s guide,
And the loving gentle Spirit
Bears them o’er the rolling tide.
2 One by one we come to Jesus,
As we hear His gentle voice;
One by one His vineyard enter,
There to labour and rejoice.
One by one sweet flow’rs we’ll gather,
In the glorious work of love,
Garlands for the blessed Saviour
Gather for the realms above.
And the loving gentle Spirit.
Bears them to our home of love.
3 One by one the heavy-laden
Sink beneath the noontide sun;
And the aged pilgrim welcomes
Evening shadows as they come.
One by one, with sins forgiven.
May we stand upon the shore,
Waiting till the blessed Spirit
Takes our hand and guides us o’er,
And the loving gentle Spirit
Leads us to the shining shore. Amen.


2Q 127, Bateman & Inglis.
I /"\NE is kind above all others,
O, how He loves !
His is love beyond a brother’s,
O, how He loves !
Earthly friends may pain and grieve thee,
One day kind, the next day leave thee,
But this Friend will ne’er deceive thee,
O, how He loves !
2 Blessed JESUS ! would’st thou know Him ?
O, how, &c.
Give thyself entirely to Him,
O, how, &c.
Is it sin that pains and grieves thee ?
Unbelief or trials seize thee ?
Jesus can from all release thee,
O, how, &c.
3 He’s thy friend ! He died to save thee,
O, how, &c.
All through life He will not leave thee,
O, how, &c.
Think no more of friendships hollow,
Take His easy yoke and follow,
Jesus carries all thy sorrow,
O, how, &c.
4 All thy sins shall be forgiven,
O, how, &c.
Backward all thy foes be driven,
O, how, &c.
Every blessing He’ll provide thee,
Nought but good shall e’er betide thee,
Safe to glory He will guide thee,
O, how, &c. Amen.

Chorus.

Marching as to war,
With the Cross of JESUS
Going on before.
2 At the sign of triumph
Satan’s host doth flee ;
On, then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory.
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise ;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise.

Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod ;
We are not divided,
All one body we,
One in hope, and doctrine,
One in charity.
Onward, &c.
4 Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain ;


Gates of hell can never
’Gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own
And that cannot fail.
Onward, &c.
5 Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song ;
Glory, laud, and honour
Unto Christ the King,
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.

His tender last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter, bequeathed

While He can find one humble heart,

3 And His that gentle voice we hear
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each thought, that calms each fear.
And speaks of heaven.
4 And every virtue we possess.
And every conquest won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.

Welcoming his weary wand’ring child.
Chorus.
Glory ! glory! how the angels sing ;
Glory! glory ! how the loud harps ring !
’Tis the ransom’d army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.
2 Ring the bells of heaven ! there is joy to-day,
For the wand’rer now is reconciled ;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is born a-new a ransom’d child.
Glory ! glory! &c.

I TO OCK of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee ;
Let the Water and the Blood
From Thy side, a healing flood,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse from guilt and make me pure.
2 Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands ;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone ;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.


3 Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy Cross I cling ;
Naked, come to Thee for dress ;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace ;
Vile, I to the fountain fly ;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
4 While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne, —
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee. Amen.

There by His love o’ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
Hark ! ’tis the voice of angels,
Borne in a song to me,
Over the fields of glory,
Over the Jasper sea.
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o’ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
2 Safe in the arms of JESUS,
Safe from corroding care,
Safe from the world’s temptations,
Sin cannot harm me there.
Free from the blight of sorrow,
Free from my doubts and fears
Only a few more trials,
Only a few more tears.
Safe in the arms of JESUS,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o’ershaded
Sweetly my soul shall rest.


3 Jesus, my heart’s dear refuge,
Jesus has died for me ;
Firm on the Rock of Ages
Ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience,
Wait till the night is o’er ;
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore.
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o’ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
Amen.

I O ONGS of praise the Angels sang,
Heaven with hallelujahs rang,
When Jehovah’s work begun,
When He spake, and it was done.
Songs of praise awoke the morn
When the Prince of Peace was born ;
Songs of praise arose when He
Captive led captivity.
2 Heaven and earth must pass away ;
Songs of praise shall crown that day:
God will make new heavens and earth ;
Songs of praise shall hail their birth.
And shall man alone be dumb,
Till that glorious kingdome come ?
No! the Church delights to raise
Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.
3 Saints below, with heart and voice,
Still in songs of praise rejoice;
Learning here, by faith and love,
Songs of praise to sing above.


Borne upon their latest breath,
Songs of praise shall conquer death ;
Then, amidst eternal joy,
Songs of praise their powers employ.
Amen.

I '"T'HERE is a gate that stands ajar,
A And through its portals gleaming,
A radiance from the Cross afar,
The Saviour’s love revealing.
Chorus.
Oh, depth of mercy ! can it be
That gate was left ajar for me ?
For me, for me, for me ?
Was left ajar for me ?


2 That gate ajar stands free for all
Who seek through it salvation ;
The rich, the poor, the great and small,
Of every tribe and nation.
Oh, depth, &c.
3 Press onward, then, though foes may frown,
While mercy’s gate is open ;
Accept the cross, and win the crown,
Love’s everlasting token.
Oh, depth, &c.
4 Beyond the river’s brink we’ll lay
The cross that here is given,
And bear the crown of life away,
And love Him more in heaven.
Oh, depth, &c. Amen.
Sankey,
I 'T'HERE is life for a look at the crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee,
Then, look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.
Look ! look ! look and live!
There is life for a look at the crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.
2 Oh, why was He there as a bearer of sin,
If on Jesus thy sins were not laid? [blood,
Oh, why from His side flowed the sin-cleansing
If His dying thy debt has not paid ?—Look, &c.
3 It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers,
But the Blood that atones for the soul;
On Him, then, who shed it thou mayest at once
Thy weight of iniquities roll.—--Look, &$,


4 We are heal’d by His stripes—would’st thou add to the
And He is our righteousness made, [Word ?—•
The best robe of heaven He bids thee put on—
Oh ! could’st thou be better arrayed ? —Look, &c.
5 Then doubt not Thy welcome, since God has declared
There remaineth no more to be done ;
That once in the end of the world He appear’d,
And completed the work He begun.—Look, &c.
6 But take, with rejoicing, from Jesus at once
The life everlasting He gives,
And know, with assurance, thou never canst die,
Since Jesus, thy righteousness, lives. —Look, &c.
Amen-

I n 7EARY of earth, and laden with my sin,
VV I look at heaven and long to enter in ;
But there no evil thing may find a home :
And yet I hear a voice that bids me “ Come.”
2 So vile I am, how dare I hope to stand
In the pure glory of that holy land ?
Before the whiteness of that Throne appear ?
Yet there are Hands stretched out to draw me near.
3 The while I fain would tread the heavenly way,
Evil is ever with me day by day ;
Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall,
“ Repent, confess, thou shalt be loosed from all.”
4 It is the voice of Jesus that I hear,
His are the Hands stretched out to draw me near,
And His the Blood that can for all atone,
And set me faultless there before the Throne.


c Twas He who found me on the deathly wild,
0 And made me heir of heaven, the Father’s child,
And day by day, whereby my soul may live,
Gives me His grace of pardon, and will give.
6 O great Absolver, grant my soul may wear
The lowliest garb of penitence and prayer,
That in Thy Father’s courts my gloVious dress
May be the garment of Thy righteousness.
7 Yea, Thou wilt answer for me, Righteous Lord,
Thine all the merits, mine the great reward ;
Thine the sharp thorns,and mine the golden crown,
Mine the life won, and Thine the life laid down.
8 Naught can I bring, dear Lord, for all I owe,
Yet let my full heart what it can bestow ;
Like Mary’s gift let my devotion prove,
Forgiven greatly, how I greatly love. Amen.
Sankey.
j T T THAT means this eager, anxious throng,
VV Which moves with busy haste along,—
These wondrous gatherings day by day ?
What means this strange commotion, pray?
In accents hushed the throng reply,
“Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.”
2 Who is this Jesus ? Why should He
The city move so mightily ?
A passing stranger, has He skill
To move the multitude at will ?
Again the stirring tones reply
“ Jesus of Najzareth passeth by.”


3 Jesus! ’tis He who once below
Man’s pathway trod, ’mid pain and woe ;
And burdened ones, where’er He came,
Brought out their sick, and deaf and lame.
The blind rejoiced to hear the cry,
“JESUS of Nazareth passeth by.”
4 Again He comes ! from place to place
His holy footprints we can trace.
He pauseth at our threshold —nay
He enters —condescends to stay.
Shall we not gladly raise the cry,
“JESUS of Nazareth passeth by.”
5 Ho ! all ye heavy-laden, come!
Here’s pardon, comfort, rest, and home.
Ye wanderers from a Father’s face,
Return, accept His proffered grace.
Ye tempted ones, there’s refuge nigh ;
“ Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.”
6 But if you still this call refuse.
And all His wondrous love abuse,
Soon will He sadly from you turn,
Your bitter prayer for pardon spurn.
“ Too late ! too late ! ” will be the cry—
“ Jesus of Nazareth has passed by .”
Sankey.
i VX 7"HEN He cometh, when He cometh
* * To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.
Chorus.
Like the stars of the morning,
His bright crown adorning,
They shall shine in their beauty,
Bright gems for His crown.


2 He will gather, He will gather
The gems for His kingdom :
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.
Like the stars, &c.
3 Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.
Like the stars, &c. Amen.
35 L - M. —Rockingham.
I 1 7" HEN I survey the wondrous Cross
VV On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.
2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the Cross of Christ my God ;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His Blood.
3 See, from His Head, His Hands, His Feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingling down ;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown ?
4 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small ;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my life, my soul, my all.
5 To Christ, Who won for sinners grace
By bitter grief and anguish sore,
Be praise from all the ransomed race
For ever and for evermore. Amen.


gg C.M. —Kelso.
I TI THEN wounded sore the stricken heart
V V Lies bleeding and unbound,
One only Hand, a pierced Hand,
Can salve the sinner’s wound.
2 When sorrow swells the laden breast,
And tears of anguish flow,
One only Heart, a broken Heart,
Can feel the sinner’s woe.
3 When penitential grief has wept
Over some foul dark spot,
One only Stream, a Stream of Blood,
Can wash away the blot.
4 ’Tis Jesus’ Blood that washes white,
His Hand that brings relief,
His Heart is touched with all our joys,
And feels for all our grief.
£ Lift up Thy bleeding Hand, O Lord,
Unseal that cleansing tide ;
We have no shelter from our sin
But in Thy wounded Side. Amen,
Sankey,
I HTHE great Physician now is near,
£ The sympathising Jesus,
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer.
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus.
Chorus.
Sweetest note in seraph song,
Sweetest name on mortal tongue.
Sweetest carol ever sung—
Jesus, blessed Jesus.


2 Your many sins are all forgiven,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus ;
Go on your way in peace to heaven,
And wear a crown with Jesus.
3 All glory to the risen Lamb !
I now believe in Jesus ;
I love the blessed Saviour’s namq
I love the name of Jesus.
4 His name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus ;
Oh, how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus.
5 Come, brethren, help me sing His praise,
Oh, praise the name of Jesus ;
Come, sisters, all your voices raise,
Oh, bless the name of Jesus,
6 The children too, both great and small,
Who love the name of Jesus,
May now accept the gracious call
To work and live for Jesus.
7 And when to the bright world above
We rise to see our Jesus,
We’ll sing around the throne of love
His name, the name of Jesus. Amen.
