The following lecture was delivered at the Mechanics? Institute,
H 1
Hobart Town, on August 15th, 1871 ; the Hon. W. R. Giblin, Esq.,
Attorney-General, in the chair. The occasion was in connection
with the opening of the new Wesleyan church, Davey-streeL The
lecture is now printed at the request of the chairman and other
friends, who considered the views it expresses worthy of fuller
consideration than could be given on the occasion of its delivery.


SOCIAL PHOTOGRAPHS.
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I trust that I shall not be charged with presumption in
adopting such a title for my lecture to-night. I have no wish
to insinuate, as a cynic might suggest, that my mind is the
principle of light, and can paint the faces and forms of the
social world with the truth and precision of sun-rays. I only
lay claim to a sensorium of the ordinary type, and eyes like the
eyes of my neighbours, set in a lighted atmosphere that is
common property. The chief credit of our modern face-
paintings is not to the earthly artist who blacks his hands with
chemicals in a very suspicious-looking closet, and looks through
glass goggles upon his inverted fellow-creatures ; but rather to
the solar brush, whose fine hairs of light achieve a delicacy of
execution that puts Dickens?s Miss La Creevy and all her genus
to the blush. I have no intention to flatter society to-night
(except in this sentence, and to serve my own purpose), and if
I compare that impersonal aggregate of life and action to a
luminous body, a far-shining sun, with a solid centre of rather
opaque material, and an envelope of splendour riven here and
there by dark chasms, it is only to relieve myself of respon-
sibility, and to show that, in attempting to paint some of the
features and landscapes of our time, I shall be using, not my
own light, but my own lens. If I set up images at uncom-
fortable angles ; if I turn people upside down ; if I seem to
defy the best principles of mental perspective, you will, of
course, attribute these phenomena to some unfortunate
atmospheric refraction in my immediate vicinity, or to some
misadjustment of my mental goggles. If I do not rightly
arrange my mental chemicals; if I leave my pale prints
too long in the sun, my sketch will be a blot or a
caricature, and you will judge me accordingly. Allow me
to explain that I do not mean to attempt anything like a
full-length photograph of any object that may be striking or


noteworthy; nor even a truncated vignette, which would be
more fashionable, and might be more popular, inasmuch as the
social head is much fairer than the social frame. Neither my
ambition, nor my art, nor my time, is enough for this. The
material and style of dress, the contour of the head, the curl of
the lip, the expression of the eye, the shape and compass of
the hand, and the direction of the foot: mere sections of
features and angles of frame will cover the range of my sketchy
purpose to-night. Perhaps, when I have finished, some of you
will say that my mind is, not in an artistic but in a literal sense, a
camera obscura, and that my speech has been not a photograph,
but a skotogra/>/i y a silhouette cloud-sketch flung over light.
These risks, of course, any one must run who attempts to take
social likenesses. With which reflection let us take leave of this
luminous figure of speech, and proceed.
In extension of these proemial remarks, let me further say
that I intend to sin against the first principles of Art, or at least
against the custom of the first masters, who deal almost ex-
clusively with elements of grandeur and beauty, by choosing for
some of my sketches subjects that have no grandeur save that
of size, and no beauty save that which morbid eyes may see.
Many features of our modem society are grotesque and even re-
pulsive ; many of the moods of our nature are unnatural; many
of the aims of our life debasing. Yet some of these features
are essential to us as a people ; some of these moods, though
mad enough, have grown epidemic in this age; and some
of these aims are so wide-spread and far-reaching that
the power and fascination of the objects which produce them
cannot be denied, although the worthiness and purity of those
objects may be gravely questioned. You will pardon the
additional remark that, in looking at forms and customs of social
life, we are looking at ourselves. If Brown laughs at an
idiosyncrasy of Jones, Jones may retort, ? Am I not a man and
a brother ? ? finding shelter for the grotesque fashions of his
temper in the principle that the aggregate and union of personal
idiosyncrasies must constitute the social identity. Criticism is
a two-edged sword, cutting both ways. Satire is a live coal,
burning the hands that throw it. The finger of scorn has joints,
and may be turned back upon the scorner. Even laughter has
echoes, and when that explosive little mechanism by which our


sense of amusement is made vocal relapses into rest, we might
hear, if the wool of conceit could be taken out of our ears,
elfish titterings rippling over the rock-pent lakes of social senses
that seem asleep ; or even demoniac laughter shaking the ribs
of our social mountains, and roaring from the mouths of our
social glens. As Nature has many species and but few genera,
and the species ranked under one genus are allied, so, under
the one genus of social character, there may be special indivi-
dual diversities; yet in all these there will be elements of the
one generic character, and alliances that are incontestable will
link men the most unlike to each other, and the most diverse
fashions and tempers will touch at some point, and coalesce
into a social unity. These reflections are by no means intended
as a bridle for expression, as a shield against the light arrows of
wit which harass that huge Titan, Society; much less are they
designed as a mean shelter for this lecture from the showers of
adverse opinion, if such should be destined to fall upon it. If
I were capable of so absurd a design, I should but repeat the folly
of Xerxes and the serio-comic example of Canute, and attempt
to control a sea that must roll and break at its own wild will for
ever. Whether the vox populi be the vox Dei or not, it is at
least the voice of the world, and one might as well try to make
the earth roll from east to west as to rule the tones and currents
of that mighty voice. Criticism will cut, and satire burn, and
scorn point, and laughter ring while man is man. And it is
w T ell that they should. Let the social roll with the natural
world, while we enshrine our philosophy in maxims like these :
? Live and let live,? Laugh and let laugh.
I shall commence with the very unflattering remark that
society is diseased. Not simply distressed by a periodic
influenza that will pass when miasmatic winter has given place
to genial spring, but afflicted with a complication of diseases
that are of a radical and chronic type. Some of the symptoms
and proofs of social disease it will be my aim to point out.
At the same time, though not arrogating to myself the character
of a Professor of Social Ethics, I will endeavour to offer a few
hints that may prove medical. While the treatment which
society chiefly needs is surgical, a process under which the
patient must part with excrescent parasites that enfold and
consume its vitals, must bleed to attain health, must lose to


gain, and almost die to live, and a process that must be wrought
mainly by itself; yet hints of a dietary character may not be
without use ; the mildest tonic or stimulus may tighten the
nerves and strengthen the pulse, and aid the patient in this
painful self-remedial work.
It is a curious instance of the cycles in which all mun-
dane things revolve, and at the same time a proof of the
tenacity and fertility of vicious principles, that the Court evils
which sharpened the arrowy wit, and envenomed the rhythmic
stings of the olden satirists ; that the scandals which drew out
the literary broadsides of the later French epigrammatists upon
the brilliant circles of the Parisian salons; that the infamous
orgies which rang through the land from the palace of the last
of our royal Stuarts, and were denounced in the pulpit-thunder of
the day, that rolled out choice curses from behind ecclesiastical
defences, in sermons of terrible power and still more terrible
length, have descended in these days to lower levels, and find
a home in the drawing-rooms and parlors of the middle class,
and in the cottages and huts of the lower : classes which before
were at least theoretically pure. The greatest revolutions are
not those which startle and scare, which blow off the heads of
our social mountains in volcanic throes and shatterings that end
in ashes and smoke ; not such as that which, when the oldest
men now living were in their bibhood, overturned a nation and
shook the heart and frame of Europe ; nor such as that whose
final thunders have but lately shaken the queenly Paris into
ruins. To find their type we should rather go to that Plutonic
force which dwells far down beneath the surface of the earth,
and slowly lifts the coast-line above the sea, and adds, by
inches, through the centuries, to the stature of the mountains,
those landscape-kings of the world ;
? we should turn our ears, and hear
The moanings of the homeless sea,
The sound of streams that, swift or slow,
Draw down lonian hills, and sow
The dust of continents to be.?
History is much easier than prophecy. We are all tempted to
start as oracles, and set our thoughts in type, and think our
utterances solve conclusively the problems of the past. It
would be difficult, nevertheless, for any of our historic oracles


to tell us how much of the habit and style of the middle and
lower classes has lineally descended from the aristocratic fashions
of past centuries ; how far our social life is a mimicry of the
Court life of times long gone. All social barriers are porous ;
through the rock divisions of birth and caste and party, influence
filters. And as man is very much what he eats and drinks,*
the draught reshapes him, and he gradually takes the form of
those of whose spirit he has, through invisible channels, imbibed.
Perhaps it would be truer to represent this descent of manners
as a result of social gravitation. That great Newtonian law
which solved the problem of astronomic worlds, finds a new
illustration in the attractions of the human world. The spilt
blood of a social sacrifice will sink and stain the earth below the
level of the altar. The manners of the highest will become, by
the law of social gravitation, the manners of the lowest. We
must by no means conclude, however, that all the evils which
afflict society have so royal and noble an origin. It would be
a convenient escape from our. responsibility as individual com-
munities, if we could trace our modem vices to inheritance,
and prove ourselves to be simply corrupt branches of the bad
roots that struck deep in the soil of ancient courts. Indeed,
the temper of the nineteenth century is too independent, and, I
think I may add, too democratic, to regard even its vices as ruins
of monarchical institutions, and would be sorry to trace in its
morals the features of a dead nobility. We are not content to be
enacting novo the manners of the peoples whose time of action
is gone, and whose time of rest slides silently by as they rot in
peace, and mix with the dust from which they sprung.
Originality is one of our strong points, one of the hobbies which
we ride at a furious, even a telegraphic pace. Hobbies, like horses,
may be ridden to death, and there is, I think, but little life left
in ours when we would rather originate a vice than inherit a
virtue. Whether our fashions have an immemorial pedigree,
or have their genesis amongst ourselves, we have little cause to
boast. Theories of creation or descent do not alter their
colour or shape ; and we shall moreover find that the everlast-
ing principles of human nature are the fertile sources of every
social evil, and every social good. Special causes will operate
upon special communities, and induce disease or health of the
* ? Man is what he eats.? ?Nrou America , c, vi. p. 42.


social frame, independently of the moral antecedents, and even
of the moral fibre of the communities themselves.
Amongst the special causes that have tended to shape and
stain our society as we see it, I may mention the great increase
and rapid diffusion of wealth, through the development of
industry and the growth of science. Fate has, moreover, in these
late years, shaken her divining-rod over the hills and valleys
of the South, and laid open the golden veins that run through
the great body of the world. So the nebulae of classic fable
have condensed into solid fact; and whereas the Greeks, drawn
by the vision of a golden fleece, went wool-gathering on the
coasts of the Black Sea, the peoples of the West and North, and
even the moon-faced Mongol of the East, have swarmed over
the ranges and glens of an unknown land, and found the far-
scattered fibres of that fleece; one or two hair-like threads
having strayed into this ungolden isle of Tasmania. lam
uttering the tritest of truisms when I say that wealth begets
luxury, and luxury moral decline. But the admission of truisms
may become a blind to the understanding. The shadow of
historic fate may darken over us as we enter the path which has
always led into tangled and haunted jungles, in the fruitless
mazes of which the manhood of nations wanders and dies.
But we commit our historic lessons to memory, and trot them
out on grand occasions, forgetting to translate them into the
current language of social forces and tendencies, and failing to
apply them personally and nationally. Here again we are in
danger of that vice which is an aggravation of vice, the
vice of throwing our burdens and iniquities back upon some
unfortunate person, or fact, that is thus made perfectly
hideous and decrepit, while we preserve our perpendicu-
lar, and offer Pharisaic thanks for our purity. A grotesque
application of the doctrine of vicarious suffering! lam
loth to say anything disrespectful of Adam ; what worship of
ancestors there may be in honouring our father we are bound
to pay him; nevertheless he has taught us, his children, a most
unmanly habit, the habit of transferring our moral responsibilities
to some one else : an all-round game which is played in these
days with amazing dexterity, a strictly private and personal
interpretation of the text, ? Bear ye one another?s burdens.?
But this vicarious play will scarcely answer. Society cannot


trace all its evil to the gold that has been transferred from the
veins of nature to its own. During my residence on one of
the Victorian gold-fields, I made the acquaintance of a sable
African, who had won his freedom by taking French leave of his
master, and was hoping to win his fortune by digging in nature s
gold plantations on his own account. He was a pious negro,
and was accustomed to quote Scripture, sometimes with great
propriety and neatness. One day I stood beside him as he
worked his windlass, and wound up a bucket of rich wash-dirt
from the shaft of a claim that was paying well. Suddenly he
said to me, with that peculiar guttural preface, the depth of
which is always the measure of African solemnity, and turning
up the whites of his eyes to heaven, ? I s?pose it am not good
to get much gold ; Peter says dat ?money am de root ob all evil.? ?
And his poor dark conscience seemed to be genuinely uneasy on
the point. There is danger that we may, in another sense, adopt
this negro?s creed, and trace back the evils which afflict society
not to its heart, but to its purse. It is not wealth, but the undue
love and rapid gain of wealth ; not the use, but the misuse of
wealth, that sows the seeds of disease, anti weakens the moral
stamina of a people. When rivers of gold flow over a nation ;
when showers of jewels rain from the skies of Fortune upon a
people, a forced and unnatural growth of manners and monu-
ments is the result of such a golden irrigation and a precious
dew. Low-born men take to walking on golden stilts; the
navvy who trundled a barrow rises to drive a four-in-hand ; and
the man who had grown cabbages, and worn moleskins, comes
to regard any cultivation beyond that of a moustache undigni-
fied, and blossoms out in broadcloth and beavers. There
occurs one of those peculiar derangements of social strata, by
which the low-typed Silurian man is raised to a level with the
tall aristocrat of the Tertiary period. A strange gaseous ex-
pansion, that certainly does not belong to gold chemically,
operates to swell and elevate the man, the courses of whose
life become flushed with a sudden torrent of wealth. 1 lie
effect upon social virtue is like that of the transplantation of a
tree from a high to a low latitude. The hardy peasant is trans-
ferred from the frigid to the torrid belt of social climate ; the
soil and the light are too rich for him, he becomes plethoric,
and at length dies of himself.


It is curious to reflect that the first principles of our sock...
and political creeds are reached, not always by reasoning, or
historic deduction, or statesmanship, but are waifs and strays
thrown up on our social coasts by seas of chance. They arc often
the fruit that grows from the flower of national circumstance.
For instance : Wealth is a Democrat. Gold is the fertile parent
of Republican creeds. No community that is rich throughout,
can be governed by a despotism. Monarchy itself becomes a
shadow, if not a sham, when a very' Pactolus of commerce is flow-
ing through its realm ; when the rent-rolls and incomes of thou-
sands of its subjects are larger than the Civil List; when Bank
and Company, and manor and mill throughout the land are
richer than the throne. History has no more complete example
of the levelling power of w'ealth, than that with which the golden
lands of the South have furnished us. As a result of the rapid
acquisition of riches by many thousands of men who had been
long accustomed to hardship and poverty, and who by a golden
chance have risen to be a moneyed aristocracy, the immemorial
barriers between class and class have been broken down, and
hitherto alien elements have entered into the composition of
the higher ranks of our society. We may welcome or deplore
the derangement thus wrought by sudden wealth, according to
our education and our social creeds. Meanwhile, let us
remember that liberty may degenerate into the vilest of
despotisms, and equality may result in an utter social chaos, a
lamentable example of which has just reached us from Protean-
fated France. A moving force, whether in Nature or in Society,
not only operates upon the material with which it is in immedi-
ate contact, but spreads over a vast radius from its central seat.
A volcanic outburst may dislocate and shake strata to great
distances from the bellowing crater, and may make the sea roll
over the coast barrier of continents far away. So when one
barrier of social life is thrown down, another is dislocated and
rent, freedom, like force, fetching well-nigh the compass of the
world. Moreover, there is a law in Society, analogous to the
law of matter called capillary attraction. Invisible filament-
channels run through a national mass, and so the moral level
and political temper of Society are affected by the state of its
frame in any one spot Thus, in the South at least, the revolu-
tion effected by the gold discovery lias led to the blotting out


of all distinctions of rank and birth ; social stature has come
to be measured by the length of purse ;
? Every door is barred with gold and opens but to golden keys.?
Luxury follows as a natural consequence, a prodigal use of those
fateful moments that have more purchasing power than the mil-
lions of the modem Croesus; a systematic pampering of overfed
lives that trample out the Spartan and ape the Sybarite ; an
effeminate art that is the foe of virtue ; and regal styles of
equipage and dress, an attempt to convey an overwhelming idea
of the extent of our estates, and the number of our bank and
mining shares, by the costly splendour of our rolling and float-
ing stock. It were well if the evil ended with the men who aim
to have all their furniture of massive gold, and, if possible, to
gild their houses in addition ; but the mania of display seizes
the shopman and the bank-clerk; the spell of woven colours
and fabrics is on the housemaid and the rustic villager; and so
a hectic flush is imparted to our commerce, and all things for a
time wear a coulcur dc rose. But beneath and after, a watchful
eye may trace, in this mimicry of fashion, the germs of immo-
rality and crime. If the history of fashion could be written, it
would form a tragedy, with social and moral ruin for the
catastrophe of its most brilliant acts. We may build ourselves
? palaces of art,? but there is danger that they may be the tombs
of our nobler manhood, and that, morally, we may become
what the Laureate has sketched in that famous allegory of ? a
glorious devil, large in heart and brain.?
? A spot of dull stagnation, without light
Or power of movement, seem?d my soul,
?Mid onward sloping motion infinite
Making for one sure goal.
? A still salt pool, locked in with bars of sand ;
Left on the shore; that hears all night
The plunging seas draw backward from the land
Their moon-led waters white.
? A star that with the choral starry dance
Joined not, but stood, and standing saw
The hollow orb of moving Circumstance
Rolled round by one fixed law.?
I would like to say a word here on the false and vicious
styles of education that prevail in these days; for this subject


is connected with what has gone before. No mental training
can proceed without moral training; every thought that stirs
the cells of the brain, every truth that we write down in the
journal of memory has a moral character and a moral influence.
I tread on dangerous ground in satirizing the modern system of
education to a Tasmanian audience. Judging from certain
speeches and leaders that I might quote, but will not, the
inference would be safe that Tasmania conceives herself to have
one of the best systems of education under the sun. I have
no doubt the Tasmanian system is excellent. But I am not
dealing to-night with the theoretic excellence of any educational
creed or plan. We may concern ourselves with the elaboration
of a beautiful system in a total disregard of its fruits. It is in
the results of education, in the lives of the men who pass
through our schools, and graduate at our universities, that we
must look for proofs of excellence in the system which has
formed their minds and shaped their course. These mental
nurseries, I take it, planted out by philosophic gardeners, and in
which the State grows its citizens, should at least turn out
vigorous and healthy plants, capable of flowering and fruiting
in any climate. The critic of our educational systems may
well ask : Where are the men who should make the strong
frame-work of a nation which spends millions, and sets apart
its noblest, for scholastic work? Not men versed in loga-
rithms and the mysteries of the calculus; who can write
Latin with Ciceronian elegance, or achieve the intricate music
of the Greek hexameter, in Attic idioms fit to raise the dead
Athenian ghosts; who can wrangle logically through deft
sophistries, and swim dexterously through metaphysical seas.
Not mere echoes of classic song and college science; not
packed brain-stores whose garnered corn is never ground by
the millstones of use ; but men of tact, and strength, and self-
control ; men who would justify Carlyle?s derivation of * king ?
from one who * cans,? an able-man, wise, sufficient, commanding;
men whose faculties have been made sensitive and prehensile
by wisdom ; men who know to do ; men whose riches are not
in rusting hoards, but in living forces ; whose thoughts are in
their hands ; whose philosophy is work. The object of educa-
tion is to train the faculties, not to a pantomimic dance of
learning, but to work, hard, patient, noble work. In fact, we


shall hold erroneous theories about education unless we re-
member that, in its schools, the State is training its workmen,
and that the curriculum is the apprenticeship to life. The vast
machinery of Government is kept efficiently moving, and the
social fabric is preserved from dissolution, by the continuous
application of trained force to the one, and the continuous
addition of strong-fibred and sound material to the other. And
yet how strangely unfitted for public life and public work are
many of the men who receive a first-class education ! finely
chiselled ornaments of our society, no doubt, master-pieces of
Educational Art, fit for any museum of curiosities ; shapely
human figures, fit to stand as mummies, embalmed in the fragrant
spices of classic lore j but totally incapable of marking and
moulding and making,?the mission of men who live not
to themselves, ?totally unfit for any office in the great
workshop of the State. On the other hand, many of the
men who do the most for the State are men for whom
her training institutions have done the least, whose necks
have never borne the yoke of scholastic discipline, but who
have trained their hands and minds to use in the school of
action. Cases of both kinds are so numerous that we are led
to ask whether the system of education commonly pursued does
not sin against the first principles of training ; whether our
schools are not simply schools of mental gymnastics, in which
the highest achievements are acrobatic feats of thought, and the
mind is trained to exhibition rather than work, and the memory
developed at the expense of the understanding. It will be well
when our rulers, and our professors, and our people thoroughly
understand that, in educating, they are manufacturing not an
ornament but an instrument. Sheffield would soon lose its
fame and trade, if its knives were made only to shine and not
to cut. No purpose can be gained that is not kept in view. If
the purpose be forgotten in the study, and the end in the means,
the instrument produced may be polished and brilliant, but it
will be useless. Faults of method immortalize themselves as
faults of life. Evil has a Protean genius of transformation, and
breathes its baneful life with equal ease into the forms of learning
and into the frames of work. There is a species of dishonesty
about our systems of Education, inasmuch as they do not fulfil
the great objects of training, and fail to prepare us for the


manifold career of national existence. That dishonesty is too
often reflected in the morals of the man whoso philosophy is too
ethereal for use, and whose polished faculties cannot apply
themselves to the work of the world. That this is not simply
a theoretic immorality we have many tragic proofs. Yet the
infusion of a little practical sense into the term and course of
social apprenticeship, a little wholesome drill in self-reliance
and self-use, would give the children of any people fortunes that
no hand of chance can snatch away, and no expenditure drain ;
would, moreover, redeem one of the noblest of our modern
institutions from a grave reproach, and save the nations from a
large per centage of the class of respectable criminals.
There is an art called Policy that is much cultivated in
these days, an art by no means new', but with new features and
masterly developments that would somewhat astonish its old
professors. Since that crafty Hebrew shepherd pitted himself
against the miserly Syrian, and made his fortune, while he gained
his wives in service ; since the clever Arabian counterfeited in-
spiration by epilepsy, the world has rolled round somewhat
rapidly. Life itself has grown to be an art, and manners have
become a mask behind which the chiselled curves of scorn, and
the fiery flash of wrathful eyes, and the lines and dimples of
laughter are unseen. We have long ago adopted the Quaker
maxim, and ? think twice before w T e speak once,? not that our
speech may be with truth so much as with policy; that we may
find time to fold our meaning in tw'o-faced sentences like the
Parnassian oracles of other days ; that our utterances may be
self-defences against the assumed over-reaching of other men.
A certain degree of policy may be thought needful as a shield
against the lances of deceit that fly from the hands of almost
every trade. But the evil, like every other evil, is spread by
exercise. As the armour of our iron-clad ships of war is
thickened, our guns yawn with wider mouths, and thunder out
heavier missiles. Thus we may learn the lesson that attack is
alw?ays measured by defence, as much as defence is measured by
attack ; that resistance and force are co-equal; that social guns
will always match, if not shatter, our social fortifications. We
are apt to forget that use is cultivation ; that, in shrouding our
utterances and deeds in what we call policy, we are in-
viting, and even producing, an aggressive deceit and law-


CaiA-I . . ...
less which have their highest expression in the
maxim that ? the end sanctifies the means.? It is no argument
in favour of this system to say that our policy is simply pro-
fessional, and that when we leave our chambers and counters
and walk home from the bar and the mart, we give up the
masquerade of expediency, and relapse into truth. If this were
the case, it would amount to the admission that petty frauds,
those neat asides of eye, and tongue, and hand, that create com-
mercial diversions, are necessary to business but not to life. But
it amounts still farther to the assumption that the Court, and
the Exchange, and the mart do not react upon the home ; that
the principles of professional do not necessarily enter into social
life : an assumption which any moralist, who is not also a ruined
casuist, will deny. Our professions are not dresses, like Oriental
robes, that we can wrap about us in graceful folds; not forensic
or ritualistic gowns under which we hide our bony angles,
while we plead, and prophesy, and buy, and sell, to emerge in
tights that discover our shape to social eyes. They are rather
outer cuticles which we cannot put off, and which harden in the
wear and pressure of work, as the skin of corns hardens under the
pressure of leather, so that we must be positively trodden on
before we can feel. I believe that our physical skin has not more
to do with our health than our professional envelopes have to
do with our morality ; and that, to the existence of these peculiar
cuticles, is to be traced the existence of so many species of
moral pachyderms in our society. When we come to understand
that craft is robbery, a positive theft of that truth of
speech, and truth of act, which man owes to man j and that
the policy which over-reaches, though a current coin stamped
with the die of popular use, is bad money, we shall have made
a first step towards that regeneration of society for which every
good citizen and philanthropist is working, but which can never
be reached while a distinction is imagined between commercial
and social morals.
Let me say a word about Taxes. One of the great social
battles that is being fought just now is that of Free Trade versus
Protection. Across the Straits we have had a new proof that
Ministries are mortal, and that power is dethroned by principle.
Tariffs and Taxes have been the chief topic of conversation in
that sister-community. There has been unusual agitation in the


Olympus of Commerce. The gods have met with blank dices,
in solemn council, and have combined to avert, if possible, the
decrees of political Fate. The commotion has rolled across to
us, and we have risen in warlike mood to defend our jams and
hops from bonds and imprisonment, and to maintain our im-
memorial right to sweeten the bread, and supply the raw material
for the beer, of Victoria. The Mercury , our social thermo-
meter, has risen to the occasion. It has placed, with unusual
dexterity, several sharp thorns in the ministerial seat of the late
Victorian Treasurer, who basely sought to betray the land of
apples and raspberries,?the fertile Kent of the South, ?for a few
miserable coppers wherewith to fill the State cash-box. The
lashings of our literary whip were such as might make the shade
of the apocryphal Junius grin, and must have imparted some
painful stings to the conscience of the ill-fated Minister, As
Tasmanian trade is so very free , of course these philippics would
have the more point for our neighbours. I have no intention
to say to what side in this political warfare my sympathies lean.
Although, having but recently come to this well-protected island,
I have personally somewhat suffered from the tariff defences of
your ports, I shall not manifest any spite by announcing myself
a free-trader. Neither have I any intention to assist our Colonial
Treasurer in revising the tariff; or, by suggesting the imposition
of new taxes, to aid him in keeping the Treasury in funds. I have
no doubt he is well able to extract from venturesome imports,
and struggling industries, a revenue large enough to maintain
the civil and the charity lists of this beneficent colony at their
present gigantic dimensions. Nay, I sympathise with him in
his difficulties, feeling that the Keeper of the Public Purse
amongst us has no enviable position ; and I should scarcely be
surprised if, in a fit of desperation, he came down to the House,
and proposed that the Government should monopolise the
atmosphere, and raise the money-value of life to a climax, by
the ingenious device of putting on the air we breathe a mea-
surement duty of so much per cubic foot! The taxes that I
wish chiefly to speak of, are not those collected by Government
officers who take round the State-hat, armed with an Act of
Parliament; but those which are levied by Society upon itself.
Taxes that are paid, not in money, but in muscle, that are
worn and crushed out of us by the very machinery of life, of


which we form a part. Taxes that we pay out of our health,
out of our honesty, out of our peace; taxes that are the
reaction of nature against unnatural habits, that are the Nemesis
of our advancement. That eternal law of compensation which
rules every force, and every life, has written a doom in the pro-
gress, the marvellous progress of these days. All our scales
are Titanic ; all our speculations are vast. We work and travel
at marvellously high pressures ; and we aim to condense the
labour of years into days. Discovery and invention keep pace
with the feverish haste of Commerce, and aid us, in our work
and movement, to mimic the rapid spinning of the spheres.
Hut we pay dearly for this morbid dancing of the pulse and
foot. Taxation is an idea by no means original to financiers.
Nature has always been a tax-gatherer, and, whenever man has
become her debtor, has proved herself a usurer as uncompro-
mising and inflexible as the Shylock of our immortal dramatist.
We grow rich in power and knowledge at our peril, for a
grievous tax is on the mind and life of men who
? tread on stepping-stones
Of their dead selves to higher things.
An interest settled by a law of the universe, and of a rate ever
higher as our steps advance, is demanded of all our ambitions
and achievements. Very many of the evils which afflict the
physical and mental man of to-day, are the taxes which he
is doomed to pay for excessive muscular and nervous exertion ;
they are reprisals after self-robberies, levied by Nature upon our
personal estate for the theft of hoarded force ; a ruinous in-
terest charged for an overdrawn account. The forces of Nature
which Science is harnessing to the car of social progress are
forces for which we pay a terrible price. We import explosive
gases from Plutonic regions, and try our hand at miniature
volcanoes, and travel by vapour, and are even proposing to travel
by lightning ; and for these luxuries we pay an enormous duty in
the ruin of property and the destruction of life. Evermore as we
increase our powers, we increase our burdens, and the social taxa-
tion keeps pace with the social income. Vain would be the attempt
to stop this flying world-wheel. Society has become electric, the
spirit of the lightning is in her veins ; to raise a hand against
her, nay even to stay while she passes, is perilous. If we must
rush headlong through life, let us try to do our rushing as


wisely as possible, and trust that no terrific social crash will end
us and exact the final tax of death.
If I were asked to describe in one word the chief evil of our
day, I would say that Society is intemperate. Wherever we look
there are symptoms of intoxication. lamby no means hint-
ing that Society is vinous ; that its chief worship is in the orgies
of Bacchus ; and that the regeneration of society would im-
mediately follow if every public-house were razed to the ground,
and the liquor of a thousand cellars poured out as a libation to
the memory of Jonadab the son of Rechab, and licenses
abolished for ever. Men who propose such a crusade, amid
the cheers of an enthusiastic people, may be orators but they
are not statesmen. Indeed, if I were asked for an illustration of
intemperance, I would choose some of the most prominent
temperance advocates whose oratorical heat is perfectly incan-
descent, but whose sense is very uncommon, and whose argu-
ments are very unsound. No one who desires the welfare of
his fellows can help sympathising with the aim of men who
are seriously anxious to put down a gigantic evil. At the same
time, it is clear enough that social purity will not be gained by
social force, and that political medicines cannot cure a moral
disease. No single curse with which Society is afflicted is
greater than the curse of drunkenness ; and that curse, if we
are to believe the social organs of the day, is spreading with a
rapidity that is perfectly alarming, both in England and
America, amongst the classes whose self-respect has hitherto
been their best defence. In God?s name let total-abstainers,
let legislators, let Christians, let men do their utmost to take
away this brand that shames the dignity and sears the conscience
of the social world. But, in God?s name also, let them speak
and act wisely. We have been visited here, of late, by a perfect
cyclone of eloquence on this question. But the gale of eccle-
siastical declamation is past, the social sea that rolled and
roared beneath it is at rest, and the Permissive Bill is still where
many of the speakers were, in nubibus. The remedies of intem-
perance are not legislative but moral; and those moral remedies
are not new but old, as old as the conscience of man and the
truth of God. To remove this curse is the work of the Church, or
of the moral and spiritual agencies, and not of the State, or of
the political forces of the world. Let the Law of purity, and the


Temperance of moral self-control reign in the heart of private
and of public life, and Society will be redeemed from this dark
curse. For the Church to petition and move the State on
questions such as this is an abdication of her functions, and a
shameful confession of her weakness.*
The intoxication to which I refer is of another kind. A
fiery stimulus is working in the brain and frame of the
world, and impelling our merchants to hasty ventures, our
swans to hasty generalization, and our statesmen to hasty
legislation. Or perhaps it is that the temperament of
modem man has become febrile, or the social system has
received a nervous shock, so that a slight stimulus intoxicates,
and a slight irritation maddens. We drink pleasure as the
jolly German barons drank their beer ; we read more volumes
in a year than our fathers owned ; we write as though some
doomful afflatus made a mechanism of brain and pen ; we work
as though we were plantation slaves, and had each some special
demon-driver. The standards of labour and amusement are
raised to a sensational height; the key-note of the social tune
is pitched unnaturally high ; and we have built the foundations
of our lile, not on the safe and solid earth, but on the buoyant
gas of excitement. Almost every social movement is in excess.
To what wrecks of virtue we have, we are adding knowledge
with startling rapidity; but we forget the next clause in the
Apostolic homily, and fail to add to our knowledge temperance;
* Since the delivery of this lecture, the views expressed in the above para-
graph have been somewhat misrepresented. It has occurred to some, and
may occur to others, that those views are at variance with a resolution passed
by the last District Meeting of Tasmania, and with the opinion expressed
by the Conference, at its last session in Hobart Town, of which Church
Courts the lecturer is a member. The difference, however, is rather apparent
than real. In the spirit of those utterances the lecturer entirely concurs,
and would be prepared to give ?cordial support ? to any ?well-considered
measure? ?tending to secure? the suppression of intemperance. The
paragraph was dictated, not by any enmity to the cause of Temperance, for
the lecturer himself is a total abstainer of some years? standing ; not in a
spirit of antagonism to the Conference, for he claims to be a loyal Methodist ;
nor yet by any special hostility to the principle of the Permissive Bill; but by
the settled conviction that the purification of Society must be wrought by the
vital principles of truth acting directly on the individual conscience, and
not by State-mechanisms that may forge temporary bonds for a vicious
appetite, but are powerless to create a virtuous habit.


the balance of moral powers, harmonious and equal self-
use ; that tempered freedom and wise restraint that are the
fruit of law. So ? Knowledge comes but Wisdom lingers,? and
the taunt of Festus will fit us, ? Much learning hath made us
mad.? Ah!
? Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:
That which ye have done but earnest of the things that ye shall do
let us trust that ? wisdom ? will not linger for ever, but will
bring at length a divine calm, and a diviner self-control to our
intemperate world. We are eating largely in these days of the
fruit of that mystic tree of knowledge of good and evil, whose
roots strike through all the world of God, and whose
branches hang fruit-laden over every path of man. And yet
w r e are not gods ) and I fear our apotheosis is as remote as ever.
The voice of the centuries, and the wreck of man proclaim
the serpent-oracle of Eden false.
One word on the literary market-place of the age, the
great Social Book Bazaar. Books never formed so large a part
of property before ; never entered so largely into the com-
position of national character as they do now. Mankind may
be divided into those who write books, and those who read
them. The fittest monument of this age would be a stupendous
pyramid of volumes, from the ponderous folios of science to the
gaudy railway novel and the ephemeral ballad, a monument
beside which the great obelisk of Cheops would dwindle into a
mile-stone, and the tower of Babel dwarf into a mole hill.
This is an age of manufacture ; the raw material of Nature
must be wrought and woven and polished by artistic hands.
We buy even our mental furniture ready made, and wear slop
thoughts from the great literary outfitting establishments, whose
tailors have shrewdly guessed our intellectual measure. No
matter what peculiar angles we may have, no matter how we
differ in mental length or mental girth, we can buy our clothes
to fit. Political economists tell us that the markets of the
world are regulated by a very simple law, the law of demand.
Slops sell because they are worn. If our modern authors are
the directors of a gigantic Circulating Library, it is because the
masses read ; and if that noble commerce of thought is dis-
graced by the sale of moral opiates and vicious stimuli that


ought to be declared contraband by the public conscience, it
is because the public lips thirst for these draughts of poison.
A wholesale condemnation of sensational literature would,
however, be unjust. A few novels of pure style and noble aim
are written, and while they thrill they elevate, and while they
fascinate instruct. Yet the millions ? dabble in the fount of
Active tears,? and swallow ? mealy-mouthed philanthropies,? and
? Divorce the feeling from her mate, the deed
and so, by indiscriminate judges, the pure juice of the literary
vineyard is pronounced poisonous, because the mixed wines
intoxicate. There are few greater evils than intemperate read-
ing ; and few things will more readily derange our moral balance,
and make us mentally drunk, than unlimited fiction-drinking.
Not total-abstinence, but temperance, ruled by a wise choice,
should be observed in this. The advocate of total-abstinence
from these light wines would surely be guilty of a breach of
good taste, and would find few admirers.at this moment, when
an illustrious name is being uttered by a thousand reverent
lips, and echoed by a million British cheers?the name of the
great historic novelist, whose centenary the British world is
celebrating to-day, Sir Walter Scott From my heart I wish that
the mantle of his manly spirit and pure genius had fallen upon
some of the writers of the present age, whose sole inspiration
is the love of money, and who are corrupters of our modem
youth.
Books are the silent teachers of the school of life. Any one
who has, even slightly, studied the ethics of social life, must be
aware that many of the changes in national morals, and in the
plan and structure of national life, are traceable to the influence
of national literature. The leaven of a written thought, laid
in the memory of a man, ceases not to work till the pur-
pose and shape of his life have been totally changed.
Vast political harvests have been reaped from the seed of
a single book. Whole nations have been destroyed and
re-made by ideas. And as ideas circulate, education advances,
being always, in the individual and in the nation, in pro-
cess, and never complete. For the human mind is an elastic
receptacle, capable of amazing distension. It is a bam
of fruitful memories, and life-containing seeds, that, though


well stored, is never full. And the national mind is
like it All mental hands that reap, and sow, and build, and
fight, become, like those strange storehouses and mechanisms
of force?the muscles ?more dextrous, and vaster in reach and
power by use. The age of types has gone, and the age of
type has come. Printing has made a rare luxury of the Middle
Ages a necessity of this, and books have become our reformers
and creators. Benjamin Disraeli has lately been dreaming
about our Indian ancestry, and has ventured in ? Lothair,? ?an
effeminate and gorgeous book ; a weary cycle of art, and ritual,
and cookery ; an oppressive display of dukes, diamonds, and
draperies, which has paid him handsomely both in praise and
pence,?to disparage the educational machinery of books,
asserting that Nature is a nobler school of wisdom, and that we
should dwell and wander with the Oreads and Naiads of the
world. Few of us, I think, would yield assent to the prin-
ciples of education developed by him in that last of world-
lionized novels, in accordance with which the most cultivated
specimens of the human race would form a sort of gypsy-aris-
tocracy, and man would arrive at the climax of power and
refinement by eschewing books, and reading only the many-
languaged volume of Nature. The influence of books must ex-
tend with the empire of thought, and we may guide a current of
moral force that we cannot stay.
Whether in civilisation and refinement man has fulfilled his
destiny, and the features of our manhood have been made per-
fect by elaborate literary chisellings, may seem to some an open
question. In view of the vast intemperance of the world, an
intemperance increased by the vile liquors of impure thought
that circulate amongst us, and in view of the terrible strain of
social life that wastes the nerve and tissue of the race, we
may even fear that our evil keeps pace with our good in
the unparalleled advancement of these latter days, that our
refinement is leprous and unsound, and that we ourselves
are on the verge of moral bankruptcy. We want a modem
Hercules to turn some river, bom of the upland snows of
purity, through the Augean stable of the social world. I wish
I could speak more cheerfully, and sketch more brightly than
I have done. I would rather hope than fear; rather sing in
faith of a coming dawn* than be a voice of evil omen, ringing a


brazen alarum through the midnight. Yet I often think, and
I think and say it sadly to-night, that we as Englishmen, after
reviving the dead ideal of Greek and Roman glory, are re-
enacting their luxurious decline, and are on the downward
slope of corruption and death. Sincerely do I trust that the
future fact may prove my fears untrue; nevertheless, I utter
my conviction that, but for a few firm and manly pillars, built
of noble thought, and based on nobler faith, the temple of our
national glory would soon become like the marred fragments ot
the Grecian temples, like the ghost-haunted ruins of Pagan
Rome. We need a new irruption of the Gothic element, a
strong infusion of muscular fibre and manlier action, to save
our thought and our faith from moral decay. I hope that
I shall not be charged with uttering a paradox, or with saying
what is irreverent, if I assert that that Gothic element, that the
materials of a nobler manhood, are to be found in that Book
which we call the Word of God. The principle of that Book
is the principle of social redemption ; its work is to make a
moral hero of every man, and to declare war to the death
against evil of every shape. Evermore the nobler is destined
to destroy the baser, and to Life God has given a mission of
Death. Unless we are destined to perish by spontaneous
moral combustion, and to deposit the ruins of our glory as the
foundation of nobler peoples, then surely, we may believe that
such a mission has been committed, or will be committed,
to some nation of the latter days, or to some of those
social organisms that live in the heart of nations. Not
against idols, and shrines, and priesthoods, like those which
of old graced the borders of the Midland Sea, and corrupted
the faith and fibre of national lives; not against nameless
mysteries wrought behind artistic veils in Attic fanes, or in the
wild license of the groves, have the moral nobility of the world
to fight We are far too material to be idolaters; we have
destroyed the charm of Nature-worship by our science. What
man can dissect, and decompose, and explain, he is not likely
to worship. It is rather against the tortuous dexterity of
modern language ; against the mania of overwork, and the
feverish thirst of wealth and pleasure ; against the hideous
selfishness that stays all manly charity, and only gives to gain ;
against the laxity of rules that made the manliness and force of


earlier peoples ; against the upheaval of old bases of frith ; against
the ungoverned subtleties of speculative thought; against the
cold currents of doubt that chill the moral air of the world; against
the revolutionary leaven of religious libertinism; against the
warpings of true science, which is divine, to false theories of
truth and goodness; against the dotage of that imperial Reason
that in many has overlived its prime; against the art-shaped and
death-working beliefs that do duty for living faith : it is against
these that the believers in one Supreme God, and one supreme
human duty, must protest and make war. No doubt the cry
of ? Barbarism,? and ? Sacrilege ? will arise, and salute the ears
of the men who attempt to rescue moral life from the splendid
tomb which the false genius of this age is building over it
Hands of horror will be held up when Gothic blows descend,
swift and heavy, on the palaces of luxury and the temples of
libertine art, and when Gothic feet trample down the plethoric
growths of the mental tropic lands of the age. I suppose that
men read history with different eyes, and therefore reach
different conclusions. As I have read it, the barbarians
were the saviours of Europe. They brought muscle and fibre
to the shattered, decrepit frame of Rome ; their new blood ran
in the sluggish veins of the empire-system, and arrested the
chronic consumption of the Western World. We may trust there
is yet a moral North where manhood is born, amidst the storms
and snows of life; where the frame is strong-fibred and
erect, and the tough muscles rise gigantic on the war-
arm of Truth, and the voice is of sea-like depth and power;
a race amidst earth?s races, not sons of Odin, but sons of
God. And if God but sent an invasion of moral Goths
into the heart of our modem refinement and artistic luxury,
Goths that will be at once the genius of destruction and the
genius of life, slaying the subtle idolatries of the time, and
wedding themselves to what is true and noble amongst us, we
may yet escape the dark fate that is before us, and be re-created
into strong and God-like men.
