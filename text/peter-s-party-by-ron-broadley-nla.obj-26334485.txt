IT was Peter s birthday, and
he was almost a man he
was four years old
Everything was ready for the
party. First there was a big
birthday cake with four candles
on it. Then there were plates
and plates of jam tarts and
cream puffs. And there was
jelly and ice-cream, and
lemonade and raspberry syrup,
and ginger-pop. and nuts and
chocolates and lollies, and
party hats and whistles and
squeakers and bon-bon crack-
ers, and hundreds - and-thou-
sands sandwiches.
He intended inviting so
many children that the house
was not big enough, so the
party was set out on the grass,
under a big gum-tree.
Peter went to the telephone
to ring up all the children and
ask them to come to the party.
He had waited until the last
moment so as to make it a
big surprise for them.
But he had forgotten that it
was the day of the school
picnic and all the children had
gone to it. Of course Peter
was very disappointed. He
was very anxious to start eat-
ing the good things, but he
was not a greedy boy and he
wanted to share them with
somebody.
Then he thought of a won-
derful idea. Til ask all the
birds and animals of the bush,”
he said. So Ke ran off down
the gully to where the parrots
lived.
Hullo I” said a big Rosella
Cocky wants a biscuit/’
You’ll get more than a bis-
cuit to-day. Cocky,” said Peter.
I want you to come to my
birthday party, and I want you
to ask all the other birds and
animals to come, too.”

delight, and flew off to spread
the good news.
First Cocky called on Mrs.
Emu, because she could run
very last and help to spread
the news.
Come to the party, come to
the party, come to Peter’s party,
screeched Cocky.
“Oh, my goodness,’’ said Mrs.
Emu. 1 must run and tell
everyone and then I must get
my feathers curled.’’
All the little Emu chicks
danced with delight; and away
ran Mrs. Emu to the scrub,
where Mr. Lyre-bird lived, and
told him the news.
“A party, a party,’’ shrieked
Mr. Lyre-bird, and rushed down
to the mirror pool to have a
look at his tail, because he
was very vain and always liked
to look smart.
When he was satisfied with
his appearance, he strutted off
and told Mr. Pelican, who
quickly combed his bald head,
and flapped off across the
swamp. He called in at Gum-
tree Gully, and woke up the
Koalas, who slithered down
the trees and hopped off
towards Peter’s place

They met the old black-and-
How Goanna, who didn t
seem at all interested in ice-
cream and jelly, but when he
heard that there would be egg-
sandwiches, he scuttled off
th rough the bracken as fast as
his stumpy legs could carry him.
The Goanna told Freddie the
Frilled-neck Lizard, who put on
a clean collar, and danced
about with a big smile on his
pimply face.
Meanwhile, the Koalas told
the Kookaburras, who laughed
with glee and swooped off
through the tall timber. On
their way, the keen-eyed
Kookaburras spotted the old
V\ ombat s dug-out, under a
stump, and they asked the
Woodpecker to knock on the
door and wake him up and
tell him the good news.
Old Wombat was very hard
to w 7 ake, and very sleepy-eyed
when he came to the door, but
he waddled off to the party
still half asleep.
As he neared Peter’s place he
passed the Bandicoot’s home,
which just a deep hole in

him about the party. 1 don t

I he Frilled-neck Lizard had
told the Flying Squirrel, who
chattered excitedly, an d glided
down and told the Kangaroos
who filled their pockets with
Joeys, and thumped off, hop-
ping over creeks and rocks and
scrub. They met the Spiny
Anteater, who was sitting on
an anls nest having afternoon
lea.
“Dlid you glay a plarty? Ke
asked with his mouth full of
ants, and away he went after
the Kangaroos.
Eventually, all the animals
and birds arrived, and wished
Peter many happy returns of
the party: and each brought
him a present.
The parrot brought him an
egg, and was just giving it to
Peter, when old Goanna
gobbled it up.
Of course, they were all very

disgusted witli Kim, but did
not make a fuss because they
did not want to spoil the party.
Mrs. Emu had also brought
an egg for Peter, and as soon
as old Goanna saw it he rushed
in and tried to gobble it up, too.
But Emu eggs are very big
indeed, and it stuck in his
mouth and he started to gurgle
and goggle, and would have
choked himself if Peter had
not come to his rescue. Now
let that be a lesson to you,
said he, ' and behave yourself.
Old G oanna felt very
ashamed of himself, so he said
to Peter: T m very sorry that I
nearly choked myself, and 1
have a present for you, too.
He gave Peter a parcel wrapped
up in paper-bark. "Oh, thank
you, Mr. Goanna,” said Peter,
who quickly opened the parcel,
and disclosed another egg.
Hey, squawked the Parrot,
that’s one of my eggs, you
old thief!” and made a rush
at him.
Old Croanna, with a very
gui Ity look in his eye, tried to
dodge the Cocky, and in doing
so slipped on a custard tart
and bumped his eye on a
lemonade bottle.

Th is made Cocky laugh so
much that he forgot his quarrel.
J hen Mr. Anteater found that
Mr. Ant was sitting next to
him, and he was just going
to eat him. when Mrs. Kan-
garoo said: “Hey! Spike, be-
have yourself, and she gave
him a whack with her big tail,
which knocked him into the
lime jelly. They all laughed
except Spike, who was very
amazed because everything
seemed to look green.
Here s my present, Peter,”
said Mr. Lyre-bird, and he gave
him a parcel with nothing in
it, and the Kookaburra laughed
and thought it was a good joke.
Of course it was only a joke,
because Mr. Lyre-bird came
back and gave Peter a beau-
tiful feather out of his tail,
which he put in his party hat.
Meanwhile Mr. Bullfrog had
been drinking a great deal of
lemonade. He was soon so
full of the fizzy drink that he
swelled up like a balloon, and
Floated into the air. He was
only saved by opening his
mouth to catch a fly. He fell
down “plonk” into the trifle,
and crawled out covered with
custard.
Mrs. Pelican tried (o eal Inm,


but remembered tbat sbe must
be on her best behaviour, and
only ate tbe custard off him.
Then somebody knocked over
a dish of hundreds-and-thou-
sands, and Spike the Anteater
darted out his long sticky
tongue and licked them all up.
“Well, said Peter, “I think
it’s dark enough to light the
candles on the cake.
But nobody had any matches,
and it was becoming very
gloomy, when Fifi the Firefly
flew in, circled around the cake
like a golden thread, and lit
the candles.
Everyone cheered, and Peter
gave Fifi a hundred-and-thou-
sand, and a knife and fork.
The Flying Squirrel had been
waiting up in the eucalyptus
tree until it was dark enough
to see properly, and had just
jumped off the branch to glide
down into his place at the
party, as Fifi lit the candles.
The glare made him blink,
so that he missed his place
and landed flat out in the
peaches and cream.
Ho-hol” said Mr. Dingo,
licking his lips. I think I II
have some Squirrel and cream.
But just then the Frilled-neck
Lizard and the Goanna were
fighting over a bon-bon cracker,
and they pulled it in halves,
and it went off with such a
loud bang that the Anteater
umped right up in the air and
ourst nearly all the balloons
with his sharp quills. Ihe
Dingo thought they were shot-
guns, and he ran away so fast
that he couldn t stop, and that
is why Dingoes are always
running when you see them.
When the Flying Squirrel
had hopped out of the peaches,
and shaken all the cream off
him onto everybody else, he
turned to Peter and asked,
“Where’s Bandicoot? He
should be here by dark.” “He’s
coming soon, replied Peter,
and just as he spoke the birth-
day cake started to wobble
about, and then it started to
move away from the centre of
the party and stopped between
the Emu and the Goanna.
Everyone was very scared
except Peter, who was now
four years old. so he picked up
the cake to put it back, and
there underneath it was the
Bandicoot, blinking in the
candle-light, who had bur-
rowed up right under the cake.
“Sorry, Peter,’’ said Bandy, “I
didn’t mean to do that;

meant to come up under the
chocolates. Are there any
left?”
Meanwhile the Squirrel was
acting as nutcracker for every-
one, hut he kept on saying.
There’s nothing in that one,’*
and giving them the empty
shells hack.
This made the Frilled Lizard
suspicious, so he poured a
glass of raspberry syrup over
him.
The Squirrel shook himself,
and the spray put out the
candles. The Wombat said:
The light’s gone out.’* How
do you know? It’s too dark to
see, said the Goanna, trying
to he funny.
But the Wombat could see
much better in the dark than
the Goanna.
Then the Bandicoot came to
the rescue, by finding some
glow-worms, and putting them
in the paper lanterns. When
the lights came on again the
Goanna had a black-eye, and
the Wombat was sitting on the
other side of the party.
Now when Bandy dug under
the cake, he had also bur-
rowed under the Koala. The
ground sudd enly collapsed
under him and he disappeared.
