SUNDAY, APRIL Ist, 1900
Zion Jnbepenbent Chapel,
THOMAS STREET, HAWTHORN.
Mighty God ! while angels bless Thee,
May a mortal sing Thy name ?
Lord of men as well as angels,
Thou art every creature’s theme.
Lord of every land and nation,
Ancient of eternal days,
Sounded through the wide creation
Be Thy just and endless praise.
For the grandeur of Thy nature,
Grand beyond a seraph’s thought;
For the wonders of creation,
Works with skill and kindness wrought;
For Thy providence, that governs
Through Thine empire's wide domain,
Wings an angel, guides a sparrow,
Blessed be Thy gentle reign!
But Thy rich, Thy free redemption,
Bright, though veiled in darkness long—
Thought is poor and poor expression ;
Who can sing that wondrous song ?
Brightness of the Father’s glory,
Shall that praise unuttered lie J
Break, my tongue, such guilty silence !
Sing the Lord who came to die,
From the highest throne of glory
To the cross of deepest woe,
Thou didst stoop to ransom captives ;
Flow my praise, for ever flow I
Be-ascend, immortal Saviour 1
Leave Thy footstool, take Thy throne
Thence return, and reign for ever :
Be the Kingdom all Thine own 1
Come, ye souls by sin afflicted.
Bowed with fruitless sorrow down,
By the broken law convicted,
Through the cross behold the crown ;
Look to Jesus!
Mercy flows through Him alone.
Take His easy yoke and wear it;
Love will make obedience sweet;
Christ will give you strength to bear it,
While His wisdom guides your feet
Safe to glory,
Where His ransomed captives meet.
Blessed are the eyes that see Him,
Blest the ears that hear His voice;
Blesshd are the souls that trust Him,
And in Him alone rejoice ;
His commandments
Then become their happy choice.
Sweet as home to pilgrims weary,
Light to newly opened eyes,
Or full springs in deserts dreary,
Is the rest the cross supplies 1
All who taste it
Shall to rest immortal rise.
Art thou weary, art thou languii,
Art thou sore distrest ?
•< Come to Me,” saith One, “ and coming,
Be at rest ! ”
Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my Guide 1
"In His feet and hands are wound-prints,
And His side.”
is there diadem, as Monarch,
I hat his brow adorns ?
“ Yea, a crown, in very surety,
But of thorns 1 ”
if I find Him, if I follow,
What His guerdon here 1
‘ Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Many a tear.”
If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay ?
Not till earth, and not till heaven
Pass away I ”
Finding, following, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless ?
“ Angels, martyrs, prophets, virgins,
Answer, Yes I ”
We speak of the realms of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair ;
And oft are its glories confessed,
But what will it be to be there ?
We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation, and care.
From trials, without and within ;
But what must it be to be there ;
We speak of its service of love,
Of robes which the glorified wear—
The church of the first-born above,
But what must it be to be there ?
Do thou, Lord, ’midst pleasure or woe,
For heaven our spirits prepare ;
And shortly we also shall know
And feel what it is to be there.


O may we love the Bible !
God’s holy Book of truth,
The blessed staff of hoary age,
The guide of early youth ;
The lamp that sheds a glorious light
On else a dreary road ;
The word that speaks a Saviour’s love,
And shows the way to God.
0 may we love the Bible 1
For it alone can tell
The way that ruined souls are saved
From Satan, sin, and hell :
In words of truth it tells us how
Lost souls ascend to heaven ;
That all who trust in Jesus’ blood,
Their sins are all forgiven.
0 may we love the Bible 1
That tells of Jesus’ love ;
Who came to earth for such to die,
And pleads for them above ;
Who bore dread sins of every dye
Upon the cursed tree,
And sends the Holy Spirit down,
That sinners may be free.
Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
See the Man of Sorrows now ;
From the fight returned victorious,
Every knee to Him shall bow :
Crown Him I crown Him 1
Crowns become the Victor’s brow,
Crown the Saviour! angels, crown Him ;
Rich the trophies Jesus brings ;
In the seat of power enthrone Him,
While the vault of heaven rings :
Crown Him ! crown Him !
Crown the Saviour King of kings
Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocking thus the Saviour’s claim ;
Saints and angels crowd around Him,
Own His title, praise His name :
Crown Him ! crown Him !
Spread abroad the Victor's fame.
Hark, those bursts of acclamation 1
Hark, those loud triumphant chords I
Jesus takes the highest station :
Oh, what joy the sight affords 1
Crown Him ! crown Him I
King of kings, and Lord of lords 1
Heaven smiles, and earth rejoices
Beneath the cheering rays
And twice ten thousand voices
Sound the Creator's praise :
The fresh warm showers of spring-time
Melt winter’s icy chains,
And scatter seeds of beauty
On verdant hills and plains.
But ’tis a brighter morning
When God, His grace to prove,
Speaks in the soul the dawning
Of everlasting love 1
The power of free splvation
Drives night and guilt away ;
For 'tis a new creation,
A never-ending day,
And what a burst of s
nd what a burst of splendour
Will on the saints arise,
When Christ their
King will call them
To meet Him in the skies 1
Their spirits free from sorrow,
Their bodies free from pain,
They will be like their Jesus,
And ever with Him reign.
Sow in the morn thy seed,
At eve hold not thy hand ;
To doubt and fear give thou no heed,
Broadcast it o’er the land.
Beside all waters sow.
The highway furrows stock ;
Drop it where thorns and thistles grow,
Scatter it on the rock.
The good, the fruitful ground,
Expect not here nor there :
O’er hill and dale by spots ’tis found ;
Go forth then everywhere.
Thou know’st not which may thrive,
The late or early sown ;
Grace keeps the precious germ alive,
When and wherever strewn.
Thou can’st not toil in vain ;
Cold, heat, ami moist and dry,
Shall foster and mature the grain,
For garners in the sky.
Then, when the glorious end
The day of God, is come,
The angel reapers shall descend,
And sing the “ harvest home.”
