FOREWO R D
This brochure has been prepared to illustrate the growth of this Company
and its subsidiaries and to highlight the national importance of the fine paper
industry to Australia.
As a result of costly research work the Company was successful in 1938 in
pioneering the production of paper pulp from eucalyptus wood by the soda
process, and in establishing the local manufacture of woodfree printing and writing
papers on a commercial basis. Output has steadily increased and an ever widening
range of papers has been produced.
Nominal pre-war rates of duty only are imposed on imported writing and
printing papers, but despite the consequent strong overseas competition the
Company has been able by maintaining a high level of efficiency to sell its
products usually at prices below, or equivalent to its competitors’.
Since the Company commenced operations the prices charged for its papers
have saved the Australian community over £13,000,000. In addition, the
expenditure of £40,000,000 from Australia’s overseas funds has been avoided.


ASSOCIATED PULP AND PAPER MILLS LIMITED
RESOURCES:
The pulp and paper mill is situated at Burnie, Tasmania. This site is suited
to meet the needs of the industry, possessing these advantages:—
A well established town;
Developed road and railway systems;
A deep sea port;
Plentiful supplies of fresh water;
Power available from the Hydro-Electric Commission;
Timber supplies.
The Company owns over 200,000 acres of forest land within a short haulage
distance by road or rail from its Mill, and has an arrangement with
the Government of Tasmania to secure pulpwood from adjacent Crown lands.

STRUCTURE:
The companies comprising the Group are related to one another in several
ways: through the inter-related capital structure, the products and operations of
each, the various joint services and the system of distribution. Let us look briefly
at each of these aspects in turn.
CAPITAL:
If we examine the capital structure we can see how the parent company
has found the major proportion of the finance necessary to enable the development
of the subsidiary companies. The chart on the opposite page shows the amount
and source of the paid-up capital of each company belonging to the Group.

CAPITAL (Cont’d):
To finance the Group’s expanding production our shareholders, over the
years, have made increasing amounts of capital available to the industry. From
£846,476 in 1937 the paid-up capital of A.P.P.M. Ltd. had grown to £7,077,848 by
30th June, 1955. A further £2,000,000 has been raised by debentures, and these
funds are also used in the business.
The number of shareholders has increased from 3,000 in 1936 to 10,000
to-day, and the average nominal value of shares held per shareholder is
approximately £7OO.
DIVIDENDS:
Along with this capital expansion of recent years has gone a corresponding
growth in the dividends paid to shareholders.
Calculations show that last year in addition to salary or wages the
average bonus payable per employee approximately equalled the dividend paid on
the average shareholding. The actual bonus payment to employees amounted over
the year to £108,962.

BALANCE SHEET:
In the pulp and paper industry the proportion of capital invested in the
form of fixed assets is high compared with many other industries.
This fact is illustrated by the diagram opposite, which sets out pictorially
the information presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Group.
TEIE INVESTMENT BEHIND THE EMPLOYEE:
The Group employs directly 2,300 persons exclusive of pulp wood cutters
working as sub-contractors. The funds used per employee have risen from
approximately £2,300 in 1940 to £B,OOO in 1955, as illustrated opposite.

THE INVESTMENT BEHIND THE EMPLOYEE (Cont’d.):
For every person employed by the Group £5,600 has been invested in lands,
buildings and plant. This is nearly seven times the average value for all Australian
manufacturing industry which, as at 30th June, 1953, has been officially calculated
as £973 per employee.
In the form of current and intangible assets £2,200 and £220 respectively are
invested per employee in the Group.
POWER BEHIND ' THE WORKER:
Our plants are highly mechanised. This is shown by the fact that behind
each employee 16 horsepower is installed.
It is interesting to compare this figure with the horsepower per employee
for industry generally in different countries: in U.S.A. the figure is 8 h.p., in
Australia 4 h.p. and in Europe 2i h.p.

PRODUCTS:
Over the years the original conception of the Company’s activities has been
extended to cover, firstly, the full utilisation of our timber resources by the
production besides paper —of a number of related forest products and, secondly,
the after-processing of both paper and forest products.

OPERATIONS:
Forestry:
The construction of roads through forest areas, forestry supervision of
re-growth, fire-fighting control and the planned logging of the Company’s forests
are continuously expanding activities. At the moment 100,000 cords of pulpwood
and firewood alone are being drawn annually from the forests.
Pulp and Paper:
The production of soda eucalyptus pulp has expanded to its present rate of
about 32,000 tons per annum; concurrently there has been an increase in the
varieties of papers made and a steady rise in output (including greaseproof and
glassine papers) to a rate approaching 50,000 tons per annum.
Forest Products:
The new American-type sawmill has commenced operations, whilst the
output of Burnießoard has expanded.
Processed Papers:
At three of the subsidiary companies considerable tonnages of paper
manufactured in the APPM mills are processed, and it will be seen that these
tonnages are steadily increasing. The rate at present is about 5,000 tons per
annum.




JOINT SERVICES:
The companies within the Group share the benefits of a number of common
services, which makes for a high level of efficiency.
