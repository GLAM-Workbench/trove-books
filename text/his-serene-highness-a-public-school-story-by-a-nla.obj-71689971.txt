HIS SERENE HIGHNESS.
CHAPTER I.
A Conference of the Powers.
Lorrimer was speaking.
?I intend to call a Prefects? meeting for
Wednesday and a Captains? meeting for Satur-
day,? he announced.
? Good ! ? Montgomery, head of Gideon?s
house, answered, ?We want to get going as
quickly as possible.?
It was now five days since Compton Prior
School had re-opened for the Summer Term.
On this Saturday evening, Lorrimer, the school
Captain, had summoned the three other heads
of houses?Montgomery of Gideon?s, Parkyn of
Kirke?s, and Richardson of Campion?s ?to a
conference. The fifth member of the party in
the Captain?s study was Toby Wenham, editor
of ?The Prior,? the School Magazine, and
fidus Achates to his fellow Schoolhouse man,
Lorrimer.
"We must take stock,? went on the Captain.
?Dear old Owlett left things in topping order,
of course, when he shoved out last term, so we
ought to have the place running smoothly
enough. Take Prefects first. With Harper,


Strangeways, Codrington, and Brown gone,
the Head will want four nominations. Fire
ahead with some names, you fellows.?
?Mason?s a good man and will be useful to
Kirke,? said Parkyn promptly. ?Enter him
as a runner, will you??
?Risrht,? said Lorrimer. ?I'll back Mason.
?How about Copwick?? asked the Gideonite
chief. ?A bit difficult in temper at times and
all that, but a thorough sportsman and quite
popular. Give the Dominions a show, old
man.?
Copwick, the Australian? Lorrimer pon-
dered the name. Randall Copwick, the asso-
ciate of Harper ?the wild Harper ?of Shotter,
and that bounder, Mabberley? What of Cop-
wick? What was it Owlett had said? ?-?Keep
your eye on Australia, old son. There s good
material there if you care to dig deep enough;
and there?s bad material there for someone else
who may get the spade.? Against this was
the Australian?s connection with the notori-
ously rotten clique of which Ted Shotter was
the acknowledged head. And Shotter was a
bad egg, a very bad egg indeed. Could Cop-
wick be trusted to shake off this evil influence ?
Lorrimer?s knitted brows showed that he was
thinking deeply. Wenham watched the dark,
handsome face intentlv. Lorrv would work
%j
it out all right: he knew that. Owlett ?the
wise old Owl ?had said to him, just before leav-
ing ; ?I?m jolly glad, Tobv, to hand over the
reins to Lorrimer. You fellows have been kind


enough to say awfully nice things about me,
now that I'm*breaking away from the dear old
place, but, believe me, Paul Lorrimer is going
to be the best School Captain Compton Prior
has ever had. He?s the soundest, whitest chap
I know.?
Lorrimer?s face cleared suddenly. ?Cop-
wick can go through,? he said. ?You all know
the possibilities of trouble, as well as I do, but
Pm going to gamble on that chap running
straight. I?ll put it to Kirke first, naturally,
as he?s in that house, but I think he?ll back
me up. Well, who?s next? Any proposal,
Richie??
Horace Richardson, head of Campion?s,
grinned nervously. Not a strong character, this
Richardson; one easily dominated by bigger
men like his four companions. Heavy of body
and easy-going of disposition, Richardson
found popularity simple of achievement by
reason of his prowess on the football field (he
was a remarkably able back) and his lack of
discipline in his house.
??We've got our full tally, you know,? was
his reply to Lorrimer?s invitation. ?Campion?s
a new man. of course, and I don?t think he?l
don t think I have anybody particularly in mind
unless?unless it?s a chap like Gregory??
?Gregory!? Wenham broke in with a snort
of impatience. ?Paste, my dear fellow, paste.
Not the real, genuine, pure diamond. No.
Lorry wants a man?'robur et aes triplex??as
your namesake put it, Horace. Cut out
Gregory.?


Lorrimer supported the Editor?s protest.
?Toby?s right, Greg?s not the man we want.
No. I?d rather put in a steady old file like Fran-
cis of your house, Monty. He?d be useful in
keeping some of your lambs in order, wouldn t
he? Or a chap like Parr-Smith. The School-
house could do with him. What do you think ??
?Tons better,? assented Parkyn. Mont-
gomery and Wenham nodded agreement, the
former being secretly glad that Gideon s house
was to be honoured in all likelihood with two
new Prefects.
?That?s settled, then,? said Lorrimer. ?I
knew you fellows would help me through in
this matter. Now, a wor( i about that
wretched boat business last term. How are you
Gideonites going to feel about it this term,
Monty ? ? ?
?Can?t say, old man,? responded the other.
?We did take it rough, you know, for we?d got
Kirke?s beaten by a couple of lengths when that
beastly oar broke. If any men Irom my house
ever lay their hands on the skunk who tampered
with the thing ?well, I wouldn?t give much for
his skin!?
?You needn?t scowl at me, Monty.? Parkyn
spoke in an aggrieved tone. ?All Kirke?s house
are under suspicion, of course ?everyone knows*
that. But it?s got to be proved that any of our
chaps did the rotten thing.?
?Proof !? snorted Montgomery. ?We?ll leave
no stone unturned, I promise you, in our hunt
for that. In the meantime ??


?No acerbity, please, gentlemen,? inter-
rupted Toby, his keen face lighting up with a
smile. ?No recriminations. And no more of
?the sword of the Lord and Gideon? attitude,
Monty. You?ve got a righteous cause, without
doubt, but you and Parkyn can fight it out on
the village green. I say,? he added, joyously,
?what a mill it would be! I?d give you free
space in the ?Prior? for the challenge. How
many stone can you give Parkyn, old man??
?Go on rotting, Toby, if it amuses you,?
retorted the Gideonite; ?but it?s no joke to us,
I can assure you.?
Compton Prior was a rowing school which
ranked fairly high among the public schools of
the country. The River Dibbin, emptying it-
self into the sea some miles away at Bournewick.
provided ample stretches of water for the
eights. Last term the big school rowing
trophy, the Bradham Cup ?presented by a
famous old Compton Prior athlete, a double
blue of Oxford?had been competed for in
the final by the two rival houses, Gideon?s and
Kirke's. The Gideonites, prime favourites,
had led from the start and were heading
straight for victory when a most untoward ac-
cident happened. Stroke?s oar suddenly snap-
ped. The Kirke crew passed their opponents
in a flash and rowed easily home.
I have said that an ?accident? happened.
So indeed it would have appeared, but a closer
examination of the broken oar gave rise to a
suspicion that there had been foul olay. The


later pronouncement by Burton, the profes-
sional coach, confirmed the belief.
?That oar ain?t broken naterally,? he aver-
red, when the two pieces were carried into the
boat-shed. ?That ain?t a clean snap through
strain. Lookee here ?an?here. I?ve seen many
a oar goo before to-day. No, gentlemen, there?s
bin a saw on this, you can see the cut as plain
as a pikestaff.? He pointed to certain marks
by the jagged edges. ?Dirty work, that?s what
it is?dirty work ! ? ?
The Rev. Septimus Gideon (he rowed for
Trinity in the early nineties) shook his head
ominously as he himself inspected the broken
pieces. ?You may be right, Burton,? he said
at last. ?There?s room here for grave sus-
picion, lam afraid ?grave suspicion. This will
have to be reported to the Head, of course, and
the matter investigated.?
But in the few weeks remaining before the
end of the term no light was thrown upon the
mystery. Kirke?s house retained the Cup, and
the Gideonites went about with dark faces and
minds soured against their rivals. Among the
seniors, of course, a certain dignity prevailed,
but the juniors of both houses openly proclaimed
their views and it was fortunate, perhaps, for
the general peace of the school that breaking-
up day arrived as soon as it did.
Toby Wenham?s mind ran quickly over the
above incidents as he lay back in one of Lorri-
mer?s easy chairs and studied the faces of
Montgomery and Parkyn. There was little


doubt, he told himself, that feeling would still
run high with regard to this matter in the two
houses, as well as in the school generally. It
was a nasty blot on the fair escutcheon of
Compton Prior. He saw at once the necessity
for dropping the subject.
?Let?s change the conversation,? he sug-
gested, ?we?re through with the prefect busi-
ness, aren't we? And we seem likely to have
some good men to join us in our counsels.?
Toby was a prefect himself in the School-
house, where he served under the leadership of
his hero, Lorrimer. ?Have you anything to
write for the next number of the ?Prior,? any
of you chaps ? A good, chatty holiday article,
you know. What about ?Frocks and Frills on
the Riviera,? Richie? Or a ?Night at the gam-
ing tables???
Richardson had spent the vacation abroad
with his people and had come back full of the
delights of Monte Carlo and Nice.
The head of Campion?s grinned amiably.
?Tennis mostly,? he replied, ?saw some top-
ping play.?
Parkyn intervened with a story of a yachting
trip round Spain, and the talk ran on easily
as one reminiscence after another came to mind.
?I was in London most of my time,? Toby
volunteered. ?The guv?nor gave me a run
round the newspaper offices. Saw the old
Record put to bed one night, and jolly ex-
citing it was, too. ? ? His father was news-editor
of a great London daily, and to Toby there was


nothing more alluring than the business of see-
ing a newspaper sent to press. ?By the way,?
he added, ?there?s some Bolshy plot going to
break loose pretty soon. I heard lots of talk
about it in Fleet Street. One of the ?Record?
men?a special ?has been nosing here and there
and tumbled on something hot. I hope the
guv?nor?ll keep me posted on the thing when he
writes. I met the chap?Allison ?myself at the
guv?nor?s club, and he told me it w T as going to
be a good story. There?s a German prince or
duke or someone in it, and an attempt at kid-
napping, I believe.?
Toby Wenham, son of a journalist and him-
self already a keen newspaper man at heart,
was finding in the editorship of the ?Prior? a
useful outlet for his energies. But he longed
eagerly for the day when the promised post of
reporter on the ?Record? should be his. What
a stroke of luck it would be if only he were
ready to leave school now and take to the great
game! His keen, sharp-featured face was
alight, his eyes were sparkling, as he referred
to the big things that were afoot.
Lorrimer?s holiday had been spent chiefly
in hunting. His father was the squire of a
Leicestershire village and famous as a hard-
riding man in difficult country. Paul gave evi-
dence of proving a worthy son in this respect.
He narrated the story of a stirring run, at the
end of which the fox had got away.
As he finished his yarn the School Captain
looked at his watch. ?Hello!? he said, ?ten


minutes to prep. Who?s on duty to-night
Kirke? You chaps?ll find some ginger-pop
and biscuits in the cupboard, if you want a bite
before you go in. I?m just going to have a
word with ??
He rose from his chair and broke ofi sud-
denly as a rap sounded on the door. ?Come
in,? he called.
Billiter, the Head?s butler, entered at the
summons.
?Excuse me, gentlemen,? he said deferen-
tially. ?Dr. Attcrbury?s compliments, Mr.
Lorrimer, and he will be obliged if you will see
him in his study at once, sir.?
CHAPTER 11.
Prince Karl of Altburg.
?Lorrimer? ?Dr. Fenton Atterbury, Head
Master of Compton Prior School, rose from his
chair as the Captain entered ??I want to in-
troduce you to a new schoolfellow. This is
Karl von Altburg. You may, or may not, have
heard of the Princes of Altburg, the State bor-
dering upon Austria. It is a great honour to
Compton Prior that the hereditary reigning
prince?or should I say ?about to reign prince? ?
?should have chosen this school for the com-
pletion of his studies by a course of English
school life. Karl, this is Paul Lorrimer, my
head boy, the Captain of the School.?


The tall, fair-haired boy of sixteen, seated
at the Head?s desk, rose and extended his hand.
?I am pleased to meet you,? he said in very
good English, and Lorrimer. looking into the
clear blue eyes, decided instantly that this was
a boy worth knowing. They were both of a
height, but the newcomer was of slighter build.
He carried himself, however, with something
of the bearing of a military man, his shoulders
squared and his body held stiffly.
?We have decided to drop the title of Prince
while Karl is with us, Lorrimer," the Head
went on. ?It is the wish of the Princess, his
mother, and Karl himself is desirous to be
treated as an ordinary member of the school.
We shall know him, therefore, as Karl von
Altburg. I will leave it to you, as head boy,
further to introduce him and make him feel
at home. Karl will be in Mr. Campion's house.
I have arranged for him to have a separate
study. Perhaps you will take Karl now to Mr.
Campion and attend to various details. You
will find Mr. Campion fully acquainted with
my plans; he and Karl are old friends, in fact,
for Mr. Campion spent a year in Altburg as the
royal tutor.?
After a few more words of conversation, the
Head dismissed them, giving the newcomer a
cordial handshake and expressing the wish that
he would be happy in his surroundings.
With Karl by his side, Lorrimer passed down
the stairs of the Schoolhouse and crossed the
big quadrangle towards Campion?s house,


which stood at the north-eastern corner of the
school buildings. Unlike the other houses,
Campion's was newly-built, a structure of brick
and stone that needed the softening hand of
Time to give it the monastic atmosphere of the
whole building.
In olden days, when Edward 111 sat on the
throne, Compton Prior, as its name betokened,
had been a famous priory. There was still to
be seen, by the junior playing fields, the deep
hollow that marked the site of a fish pond
wherein Alcuin?s monks and their successors
had made sport with rod and line. As history
records, the great Cardinal Wolsey took in hand
the reformation of the English Church, which
had become notoriously corrupt, and his first
step was to suppress a number of the monas-
teries. Compton Priory was among those thus
affected; the establishment was swept clean of
its monkish tenants and the ample revenues of
the priory were applied to educational pur-
poses. In due time, under Henry VIII the
whole of the monastic system in England was
destroyed, and following upon this came the
foundation of many splendid schools. It was
only fitting that Compton Prior should be one
of the seats of learning thus established. The
school dated its beginnings from 1541, and had
grown into the most successful school in the
southern counties. Incidentally, it may be
mentioned, the place had its traditional ghost.
The spirit of a former prior, of Henry VIPs
days, was reputed to haunt the block of build-


ings now occupied by Kirke?s house and
Gideon?s house, the two being connected by a
stone passage. The school cherished the tra-
dition, and Toby Wenham (following the exam-
ple of former editors of the ?Prior?) had made
excellent ?copy? therefrom.
As he kept pace with the School Captain,
Karl von Altburg could not but be impressed
by the fine old stone buildings, mostly covered
with ivy, by the quaint latticed windows where
no modern hand had replaced them, and by the
solid-looking buttresses that flanked the main
structure. The whole place wore an air of ven-
erable age; he was to come in time to an under-
standing of the love and reverence which was
felt towards it by everyone who passed through
its portals.
The new boy was conscious of this feeling in
a way, but his attention was diverted from the
school buildings themselves to some of its
present inhabitants. On crossing the quad to
pass under an archway that led to the part still
known by the name of The Cloisters, the two
encountered one of the junior masters and
several boys on their way to the schoolroom.
The bell for 7.30 preparation was already
ringing.
Lorrimer saluted the master, saying, ?Don-
aldson, he takes the Lower Third.? He
greeted three of the boys they met with a smile
and a passing word. ?New man?Campion?s?
showing him round after prep.,? he announced.
?No time now.? Then as they continued their


Wav he turned to Karl, ?That tall chap is
"hotter,? he said, ?one of Kirke?s. The others
are Mabberley and Cop wick. Mabb y -
euv?nor is an M.P., Labour man and Socialist.
You know the sort of thing, perhaps!
Karl nodded. ?I have followed your poli-
ties,? he said quietly. ?Is your friend of the
extremists'?? . - f u
?Extreme enough,? answered Lornmer with
a short laugh. ?I don?t recommend Mabberley
as a pal, old man. They call him the Bounder
here, as you?ll find out. But you 11 meet him
later The other chap, Copwick, is an Aus-
tralian?from Sydney, where the harbour comes
from. He is a decent enough chap, good at
cricket and tennis, and a splendid swimmer.
You?ll probably like him. By the way, what s
your strong line ? What were your games at
home 1 ?? . , ,
The word ?home? brought a quicker heart-
beat to the young Altburgian; in a flash the
wooded slopes of the capital, Cheritzi, and the
orev towers of the old castle, sprang before his
eyes. But he put the pang of nostalgia quickly
from him. He was in England, at Compton
Prior, with his self-set task before him, and
there was to be no weakening, no turning back.
What would have been his thoughts could he
have forseen the startling events that the com-
ing months were to wfltness !
?Games V? Karl made a foreign gesture with
his hands. ?Mr. Campion tried to teach me
vour cricket,? he said, ?but I am afraid with
V


little success. I prefer fencing and swimming
and boating. Then, I used to ride a great deal.
We of Altburg have always been good horse-
men. But I want to learn?Paul. Do I call
you by that name?" he asked diffidently.
"I should like to be Karl, just Karl, to you.?
?Righto,? responded the Captain. * ?Go
ahead with ?Paul.' If we?re going to be pals
don't lets stand on ceremony. I shan?t ?Prince?
you. you know, or call you ?Your Highness.? ?
"The Prince of Altburg is ?His Serene High-
ness,? explained the other gravely.
"All right, Your Serenity,? laughed Lorri-
mer. ?I?ll remember that for State occa-
sions. He took Karl's arm in his arm and the
friendly touch went far to make the newcomer
feel less strange in this new world of English
school life. Karl joined his laugh to Lorrimer?s
and as they came together through the Cloisters
to the smaller quadrangle beyond which was
I ampion?s house they had all the appearance of
a pair of chums.
I hose bright spirits of the junior school,
Badgerley and Power of Kirke?s house, speed-
ing across to be in time for evening prep., cer-
tainly entertained the idea. But the sight of
the new boy made them check. ?Rotten
foreigner!? said the Badger, as he was styled.
?Microbe, what are we coming to! Looks like
a German to me. Fancy old Lorrv cottonino-
to that !? ? 1 �
?Blow the Hun!? exclaimed the Microbe.
?The bell's stopping, Badger, an? I?m not going


to be caught late this time, I tell you. I m fed
up with lines?last term was hot enough ! Come
1 5 *
The two made a spurt and disappeared
through the archway. Lorrimer and Karl con-
tinued their way, oblivious to the attention they
had received, and passed up the steps into t e
house where Karl was to spend so much ot his
school life. .
It was Lorrimer's first encounter with tne
house-master. He had seen him, of course, in
hall; but as yet they had not met. He liked
John Campion at once. A tall, well-set-up
man, with bronzed face, dark brown mous-
tache, and dark brown curling hair. The blue
eyes, like those of Karl, were clear and brig t,
they looked at you with the same directness.
?Glad to meet you, Lorrimer,? ? he said
genially, extending a hand, as the two were
ushered into his room. Lou re the head of
the school, I know, and I look to you for some
moral support, eh? I'm new to Compton Prior,
and it won?t be easy to follow a good man like
my predecessor. Mr. Curtis was very popular,
wasn t ne!
?Quite, sir,? replied the Captain, ?but you?ll
soon shake down, sir, I?m sure, and find things
all right. They?re a jolly lot of fellows here,
taking them all round.?
?I haven?t a doubt of that,? Mr. Campion
smiled. ?And so, Karl,? he went on, turning
to the other boy, ?you?ve actually come to Eng-
land. Well, I?m very glad to have you in my


house, and I hope you?ll be comfortable here.
Lorrimer knows we?re old friends, eh ? That?s
right; then, we needn?t waste time in explana-
tions. Let?s come right away to your study and
fix you up. You?ll be excused prep, this first
night, of course. Tell me, who came with you
to the school ?from Altburg, I mean??
?Strabig,? responded Karl. ?He brought
me straight to Dr. Atterbury. He returned to
London an hour ago and is going to proceed
home to-morrow.?
Strabig ? Good man. I should like to have
met him. However, we shall see him again in
some months? time, no doubt. You?ll be cut off
from Altburg for a long time, Karl, I expect,?
he added. ?We?re going to make you some-
thing of an Englishman, you know.?
He gave his jolly laugh, as he clapped the
boy on the shoulder, and Paul found himself
warming still more to the new house-master.
He liked the way the other looked at and spoke
to Karl. They were good comrades, he told
himself.
Leading the way, Mr. Campion conducted
them to the study that had been allotted to the
newcomer. It was a fairly big room, facing
south; the window opened on to a garden which
was now bright with wall-flowers, lilac in full
bloom, early flags and other flowers. Beyond
the eye had a glimpse of the fruit and vege-
table garden, where apple trees were in the full
beauty of their pink and white blossom. The
wall-paper was of light brown, plain, and only


relieved by three brightly coloured landscapes
that hung on the walls, the furniture included
a round table in the centre, two large easy-
chair? and a cane lounge chair, with a small
sideboard by the door.
?We?ll see about making things more com-
fortable for you next week, Karl,? remarked
Mr. Campion. ?I will just get a picture or
two foi you to go on with. Batten and Morti-
mer, who, it seems, shared this study last term,
carried off their own stuff to their new room.
They hive been moved to the end of the cor-
ridor.?
Lorrimer, appealed to for advice, had some
useful counsel to give with regard to the fitting
up of the room. A bookshelf here, and a cup-
board there, would add to its completeness.
?I brought a number of books with me,?
Karl commented. ?I want to continue my
reading of your best novelists with Mr.
Campion.?
The discussion lasted a few minutes longer,
and then Lorrimer returned to his own study
in the schoolhouse, prefects and a certain num-
ber of seniors being excused attendance for
preparation in the Big Hall. His mind was
active with many questions concerning this new
arrival at Compton Prior. It was not every
day that such a personage as a Royal Prince
made his advent at an English Public School,
and he wondered how Karl, with his different
upbringing and, therefore, peculiarly foreign
point of view, would fit in with the various


types that the school contained. He would
have been more curious could he have over-
heard the little conversation that took place be-
tween his new companion and the house-naster
following upon his departure.
Mr. Campion settled himself in one of the
big easy-chairs and lit a cigarette. ?This re-
minds me, Karl, " he said, as he flung the match
into the empty fireplace, ?no smoking for you
here, remember. It is a school regulation. No
one of the seniors?and you are of them, of
course ?is allowed to smoke.?
The boy, who had gone to the window and
was gazing out across the garden, nodded an
acknowledgment. ?I understand,? he said
There was silence for a few moments. Then
the master spoke. ?So the game has begun,
Karl. You have set your hand to the plough.
I know you to be of great courage, and I pray
God that everything will come right and that
you will succeed in your purpose. Strabig has
no news to tell of Otto, I suppose? No, I
thought not. The old fox will move warily.
It will be some time before he shows his hand,
but we must be watchful. When he strikes, he
may strike swiftly, and then??
Mr. Campion paused and puffed slowly at his
cigarette. He looked across at the still figure
by the window, a kindly soft gleam in his eye.
There was resolution in the well-knit body, in
the squared shoulders and the proud set of the
head.


?Where is Franz?? he asked suddenly.
Karl turned. ?He has a room in the village
-sir. At the inn.?
The master nodded. ?That?s right,?? he
said. ?The ?sir? is customary here; don?t for-
get that. Away from the school we may un-
bend. In the village, is he? Good. I shall
take an early opportunity of visiting him.?
Another pause ensued. ?And Karl ?the
other Karl, I mean?you have heard from
him??
?A brief letter, sir,? the boy answered. ?He
has started on the journey. Just a few words
of good wishes. Mr. John, I shall pray to-night
that all will be well with him and Altburg and
the Princess. It will be well with him, will it
not? It must be!? The boy?s voice had a ten-
der, pleading note in it.
Mr. Campion rose from his chair, and going
to the window put his arm affectionately round
the lad?s shoulder.
?My dear boy,? he said, ?we are in God?s
hands'; He will direct us. It is a serious
task that we have undertaken, but we have
courage and faith, and, God willing, we shall
win through. Now, put all misgivings on one
side; look cheerfully and boldly to the future,
and make up your mind that you will be happy
here at Compton Prior. What will be, will be.
I shall have to read you more of Sam Weller
and instil some of that jolly old optimist?s
maxims into your mind. Come along to my


room now and have something to eat. Then,
when prep, is over, I?ll get Lor rimer along to
take you round the place and make you ac-
quainted with some of the fellows. He is a
good chap, Lorrimer, isn?t he? You like him,
I can see.?
?I do,? assented Karl readily. ?I am to
call him Paul, and we are going to be great
?chums ?that is the word, is it not? Yes, I
like Lorrimer.?
CHAPTER 111.
Sport Afoot !
True to his promise, Lorrimer lost no time
in making Karl known to his schoolfellows.
Campion?s, dubious at first as to the intrusion
of a foreigner, extended the hand of welcome,
inspired thereto by the evident approval of the
newcomer by their house-master and School
Captain. By the Monday following Karl had
?shaken down? in his new quarters. He had
made the acquaintance of several of the masters
on the staff. On that day, too, Dr. Atterbury
put him through a brief examination and he
was placed in the Lower Sixth, a tribute to his
tutorship which was highly gratifying to Mr.
Campion.


As luck would have it, the last of the seniors
formally to make the acquaintance of Karl was
Shutter and his friend Mabberley. Lornmer,
still actum as bear-leader, accosted the two
Kn keites ft the mid-day lt was most
unfortunate for the encounter that Mabberley
that morning had experienced some trouble m
the class-room. In the course of a history les-
son under the Rev. Septimus Kirke he had
shown woeful neglect of the previous prepara-
tion, and some insolence on his part had met
with a well-merited imposition Ihe
Bounder?s? temper was edgy when he emerged
from the class-room with his boon companions.
?Shotter,? exclaimed the Captain, as he drew
alongside the pair, ?I want to introduce Karl
von Altburg, a new man just come to the shop
and housed at Campion?s. This is Ted Shotter,
Karl,? he added; ??he?s in Kirke s house. A
ereat footer man, but you won?t see him shining
until the autumn and winter. And Gregory
Mabberley, also of Kirke?s. Mabberley s father
is one of 6ur M.P.?s who is becoming a power in
the House.?
?I understand,? responded Karl with a nod.
?You must not think that I have not followed
vour politics. John Campion he pulled him-
self up short and grasped the hand that Shotter
was already holding out. ?I am very pleased
to meet you,? he said, ??my friend Lornmer is
so anxious to make me feel at home with \ou
all.?


Mabberley, meanwhile, stood a little aloof,
his hands in his pockets and a scowl upon his
face. Disregarding this rudeness the new boy
proceeded to chat with Shotter and Lorrimer
on the matter of school games. Unhappily
again for the ?Bounder (it was not his lucky
day, certainly !) Toby Wenham w x as passing the
group at the moment and noticed the other?s
behaviour. He swung round on his heel, with
that mocking smile that never failed to incense
his enemies.
You must excuse our Mabberley, friend
Karl,? he explained. ?Good Gregory?a bril-
liant light of the Fifth?is a democrat of demo-
crats, he can walk with kings and lose not the
common touch. Hence his reluctance to shake
the proffered paw, eh, my Mabberley??
?Shut your mouth!? retorted the irritated
Bounder. ?Always airing your cleverness,
aren?t you!?
?I suppose brains will tell,? mused Toby, en-
joying the fact that he had successfully drawn
Mabberley.
?We will not discuss ?class,? ? he continued;
that bone of contention. You will hear friend
I beg your pardon, comrade?Gregory at the
Debating Society in due course, Karl. He is an
advocate for the masses pure and simple. Vox
populi. The family tradition. ?0 fili pulchro
patre pulchrior.? I apologise to Horace.?
Not having sufficient Latinity to understand
the Sixth-former?s gibe, but realising from Lor-


rimer?s unrestrained laughter that he had been
held up to ridicule, Mabberley lost his temper.
?I?ll please myself whether I shake hands
with a German,? he declared with emphasis.
?We don?t want Huns over here. Truckle to
?em yourself, if you like, but leave me out.?
Karl regarded the other s flushed face
steadily. ?But it is a mistake,? he said
quickly' <C I am no German. We Altburgs are
really Magyars. My mother, though, was of
Saxony, and I am told I take more after her.
?You hear that, Bounder?? Toby was angry
now at Mabberley s overt insult. Take back
the Hun.?
?I take back nothing,? was the other?s de-
fiant retort. ?I said Hun and I stick to it.
Come on, Ted,? he added, turning to Shotter
and anxious to make as dignified an exit as
possible before Whnham loosed another shaft
at him, ?we?ll find better company.?
The two went off, arm in arm, Shotter with
a sheepish grin on his saturnine face; he was
conscious of the poor figure that his companion
had cut, but at the same time he was glad at
having witnessed a snub to the Captain, indi-
rect as it was. They had not time, however, to
get beyond earshot of Toby?s tongue.
?Unswerving to the end, you observe,? re-
marked the ?Prior? editor. ?A last-ditcher,
comrade Mabberley. Note
* The jealous mind that sped the vcnora?d barb.? ?


The look of malignity that the goaded Mab-
berley flung back at him had the effect only of
heightening Wenham?s genial smile. Toby
joined his arm to that of Karl as they continued
their way through the quadrangle.
?Not our best specimen, my dear fellow,?
he said. ?Forget the unpleasant incident, will
you ? And blame me as much as you like for
the ?contretemps.? ?
?I do blame you, Toby,? interrupted Lorri-
mer. ?You never miss a chance of rotting
Mabberley, and now you?ve fanned a spark
that may burst into a flame. He?s a venomous
chap, the Bounder, and with Shotter and
others of the clique he?ll make trouble against
Karl. Indiscreet, old man?you were indis-
creet.?
( Toby gave a wry smile. ?Possibly,? he said,
?but the moment, Lorry?it was irresistible.
?0 fill pulchro patre??l couldn?t resist it!?
Lorrimer laughed, his moment of seriousness
passed. Well, it?s done now, for good or bad.
Let?s hope the bounder won?t take it too badly.?
Unknown to the seniors, part of the above
incident had fallen under the observation of
that bright member of Kirke's Lambs known
as the Badger. With his satellite, the Microbe,
he chanced to pass at the moment that Karl had
defended himself against the charge of being a
Hun. The raillery of Wenham, though he
understood little of its purport, and the obvious
discomfiture of the Bounder, delighted him infi-


nitelv. Of one house as they were, the two
had good reason to dislike both Shotter and
Mabberley, who were notorious bullies.
The feeling of antagonism towards a for-
eigner, inherent in a British small boy with a
year and a half of public school training, was
unconsciously weakened by the dignified bearing
of the alleged German. Though Karl was
blissfully ignorant of what was occurring, tie
was about to enlist on his side a somewhat
powerful ally. The evidence of this was to
follow shortly.
The rest of the day passed peaceably tor
Karl. In a higher form than either Shotter or
Mabberley, who were members of the Upper
Fifth, he did not meet them in class-room work.
That afternoon he was engaged in mathematics,
a favourite subject, and in Latin under the
Head Master. In the evening, after prepara-
tion, he was carried off to Lorrimer s study for
a convivial hour with Wenham and two or
three newly-made friends in the Lower Sixth.
That same evening the Badger?s active mind
asserted itself. Evading the watchful eye of
Mr. Campion, the master on duty, he propelled
a hasty note towards Belton, his chief ally
among the Lambs. Faithful adherent though
he was, the Microbe was too insignificant a per-
sonality for his bigger schemes.
?The clan to-night,? ran the epistle. ?The
cellars, 8.40 sharp. Carry the torch. All of
the Tong must attend. Wang.
� The Chief.?


Distinguishing the most important words of
this rather cryptic message from the blots in
which they were enveloped, Belton set to work
hurriedly to carry out his task. A number of
similar missives were despatched on their way
round the desks, and the train was laid for what
eventually proved to be a gathering of no little
importance.
That evening, as soon as prep, was ended
and the Middle and Junior school were dis-
missed, a number of boys made their way singly
to a little frequented corner of the School
buildings by Gideon?s house. Here was to be
found entrance to ?the Cellars,? three or more
rat-infested subterranean rooms that ran be-
neath the Gideon stronghold. At one time most
useful to the monks of the Priory as wine cel-
lars, these vaults were now utilised only by the
gardening staff of the school. Wheelbarrows,
spades, hoes and an assortment of boxes, wire
netting and other articles littered the floors.
At the door of the first cellar stood the sturdy
Belton, warden of the portals. ?Wang,? mut-
tered the first arrival, and the youth was al-
lowed entrance. The same password was forth-
coming in every other instance, and presently a
little band of twenty had gathered in the inner
cellar where the meeting was to be held.
Your small boy at a big school is a gregari-
ous animal. He displays, in a way, the same
clubbable sense that characterises his elder
brethren. Hence his predilection for secret
societies. It was a tradition at Compton Prior


that the Junior School should have at least one
Secret Society a term. Last session there had
been a wave of Gilson, following upon the read-
ing of an exciting story of Chinese adventure.
The imaginative Badgerley had thereupon de-
creed the formation of a Tong (as he styled it,
with no real understanding of the word), himself
being self-elected into the position of President.
Of the success of the Society there had been no
doubt. Its initiation ceremonies had given un-
bounded delight to the members in general, and
their literal interpretation of the commands laid
upon them by the Council had led to alarms and
excursions within the School that brought the
perpetrators much kudos.
On the high throne ?a structure of boxes
placed one on the other and covered with some
sacking?sat the Badger. Before him were
three candles, fixed in ginger-beer bottles, their
wavering flames lighting up the gloom of the
vault. The remainder of the Tong ranged
themselves in rows beneath the President, some
on boxes, one group on a large wheel-
barrow, while others lounged against the walls.
?Felkuv-members of the Tong,? began the
Badger in as deep a tone as his voice could
command, ?we are gathered here for the last
time before we disband. The Society has
achieved the high purpose for which it was
formed. The Council thank you for your obedi-
ence to their behests? (?spell it, Badger!? said
a muffled voice from the background, but the


President disregarded the interruption and
proceeded calmly), ?and ?and ?submit them-
selves for re-election,? he added lamely.
?But, aren?t we disbanding?? asked some-
one.
?Of course, we are,? retorted the Badger,
dropping his Presidential manner; ?that s why
we?re here, isn?t it? We want a new Society,
you chaps. The question before the house is,
what is it to be??
?Let?s have masks this time,? suggested a
Kirkeite in the front row, but this was promptly
vetoed. ?Too kiddyish;? ?We had ?em a term
ago;? came from various quarters of the room.
Whisperings were audible here and there as
isolated parties conferred together. A pirati-
cal band was the suggestion of one bright spirit,
the Dibbin seeming to offer facilities for
marauding expeditions. ?Something in the
detective line,? prompted another, this being
met with the retort that, in that event, some-
thing might be done towards elucidating the
mystery of the smashed oar of the Gideon boat.
?Jolly little mystery about that!? exclaimed
a Gideonite, and a cry from his supporters
went up : ?What price Kirke?s??
?Shut up, Pauncefote, you silly little ass!?
shouted the President, identifying a well-known
heckler. But the challenge was too obvious to
be disregarded. ?It?s a lie!? shouted the in-
suited Kirkeites. ?Yah! pot-snatchers!? came


an enemy retort, and the next moment the
speaker went over backwards to the sound of a
splintered box.
In vain the President appealed for order.
The battle gage had been thrown down and the
rival forces joined. For the next few minutes
Kirkite and Gideonite were engaged in hand-
to-hand combat, to such extent, at least, as the
gloom of their surroundings made possible. By
the efforts of Belton, the hero of many a junior
Rugger match, and several Schoolhouse stal-
warts, order was at last restored. The dis-
hevelled combatants, ruffled in clothes and tem-
per alike, re-seated themselves and acknow-
ledged an armistice.
?Gentlemen ?fellow members, I mean,? pro-
claimed the Badger from his high seat (?Why
not gentlemen?? asked a voice), ?what?s the
good of letting yourselves go in this way. We
all know the Kirkeites (?Don?t we just!? from
a Gideonite corner) ?I was going to say, we
all know the Kirkeites have had a tough time
of it since the race. But the whole matter is
sub?sub ?(?rosa,? suggested a partisan, and
the hubbub broke out anew) ?Look here,?
the Badger declared vehemently, ?I?m blowed
if I don't chuck the whole thing straight away !
Do you want a Secret Society, or don?t you?
And for goodness sake chuck baiting about the
beastly oar business!? He banged the impro-
vised table in front of him and put one of the
candles out of commission.


?What?s it to be?? he asserted again. ?Are
we going on with the thing or not ? ? ?
?All right, Badger, kape your wool on,?
said O?Donell, the Irish leader of a Gideonite
faction, whose collar now had one end waving
to and fro in the draught. ?Sure, isn?t there
any other foreign jape loike the Tong, that we
can work up ??
?We?ve got a foreigner already,?? interjected
another Gideonite. ?Let?s rag him. Blooming
German, ain?t he? The Bounder says he?s a
Hun.?
?He?s not a Hun,? declared the Badger
stoutly. With all his faults the moving spirit
among the Kirke juniors possessed a true Brit-
ish sense of fairness. ?He?s a?he?s a Jaguar.?
?A whatV ? the question came from several
quarters at once.
?A Jaguar.? persisted the Badger. ?I heard
him say so when he was yapping with Shotter
and Mabberley. The Microbe an? I were pas-
sing at the very moment. Weren?t we, Mike ??
Power, thus appealed to, added his support.
A diminutive youngster of eleven, with puny
frame and small, wizened face, it was easily
understood how the nickname of Microbe had
been bestowed upon him.
?But I thought a Jaguar was a kind of wild
beast? (?So he may be,? put in someone from
the doorway)??l mean a?a ?a sort of lion
or tiger,? hesitatingly added the speaker, a
Second Form member of Kirke?s house.


?My deah boy!? came another voice, in a
fair imitation of Mr. Clement Manning, the
Upper II master. ?My deah boy! Your botani-
cal knowledge is really lamentable!?
?Well, whatever it was,? said the Badger
genially, ?it was something jolly different from
a Hun, anyway. And if the new chap isn t a
Hun, he can?t be a German, can he?? The
logic of this was irresistible, and the Badger
recognised that he had carried his point.
?Now,? he continued, ?never mind about
this chap, Karl von what?s-is name ?we can
get on without him ?? (?Why not be a Karl-
ist?? asked someone, with a hazy idea that this
name signified adventure and romance of some
kind) ??what I say is, let?s get on with the
business of the evening. A Secret Society was
what we came here to form ?? ?
?Begone?Ye Sorry Fools!? came a deep
sepulchral voice from immediately behind the
President?s chair. The Badger, taken by sur-
prise and startled by this sudden and alarming
monition from the unknown, fell back on his
throne, and the structure, unbalanced, col-
lapsed with a crash to the floor, together with
its luckless occupant.
Consider now the treachery of one, Pottle-
well, Third-Former and Schoolhouse adherent.,
he of the ferrety face. While the commotion
consequent on the brawl between the Kirkeites
and Gideonites was settling down, Pottlewell


had eluded the vigilance of the doorkeeper and
swiftly betaken himself from the assembly.
Darting round the corner he then sought
another cellar that lay directly behind the one
wherein the members of the late Tong were
foregathered.
A cautious hiss between his teeth brought a
couple of dark forms to his side. ?Hello,
Potty?? came the greeting. ?All fixed up??
?Right as rain, Merrick.? replied the other.
?That you, Johnny?? he asked, addressing the
second figure. Johnson admitted his identity.
?When do we burst it on ?em?? inquired the
latter.
?We?ll get along to the back of the Badger at
once,? said Pottlewell briskly. ?He?s getting
the chaps in hand again and ready to make
another speech about his blessed Society. Come
on; we can hear him booming through the wall.
Keep your voices low. Here?s the pipe, Johnny,
that runs through from this place to the next.
Bend down to it. An? when he?s starting to
really address the meeting let the old ghost
speak out! You know the wheeze. Real old
deep rich notes; ?Begone Ye Sorry Fools!?
Then give ?em another one as a finisher.?
The result of the conspirators? plans was in-
stant. As a consequence of the Badger?s de-
thronement the two remaining candles had suf-
fered eclipse. The cellar was placed in total
darkness and the effect of the sepulchral tones
from the void was tremendous.


?Go on!? whispered Merrick. ?Begone ?
and vex not my troubled soul!?
?Can you get in one first about Campion?
put in Pottlewell hurriedly. ?The beast drop-
ped on me this morning like a ton of bricks.
Just a word??
?No !? came Merrick?s whisper again. ?Go
on, Johnny, get on with it!?
?Begone,? groaned Johnson, ?And Vex
Not My Troubled Soul!?
On the other side of the wall they heard the
Microbe?s squeak. ?It?s the old monk! The
Ghost! ? ?
?The Ghost!? cried several together, and
there was the sound of a box hurriedly kicked
aside and of something that fell to the ground
with a crash. Then a quavering voice cried
? What 1 s thatV ? And a moment later panic
broke out. There was a wild rush for the door,
and the prospective candidates for the Secret
Society bolted pell mell.
Pottlewell ?snake in the grass ?joined the
mob, shouting with the loudest. The discom-
fited juniors tore up the steps and burst into
the open with scared faces and beating hearts,
making for their respective houses at top speed.


CHAPTER IV.
The Story of Prior Anselin.
The Saturday afternoon being fine, and no
cricket practice having been yet decreed by
Montgomery, it was suggested by Lorrimer that
a few hours on the river would best occupy the
half-holiday. Karl at once expressed acquies-
cence and "Wenham was quite ready to join
them. The three were in the Captain?s study
after dinner when this decision w T as arrived at.
While Lorrimer changed into his flannels the
other two returned to their rooms to prepare
similarly for the excursion. They met, a quarter
of an hour later, at the boat house.
Lorrimer, who had often worthily upheld the
honour of the Schoolhouse on the river in past
years, took the oars. Wenham, no great water-
man, attended to the steering. As the Captain
settled into his stroke, sending the light skiff
cleanly and strongly through the water, Karl
could not but admire the ease and skill which
the other displayed. Thanks to Mr. Campion?s
tuition he himself had acquired no little pro-
ficiency in rowing. On the river that ran by
Cheritza he had been successful in many a
keenly-fought race. Possibly the memory of
such days was before his eyes, as he lay back
in his seat, looking idly at the wash of water
that the craft made in its progress.


There was much, too, to keep him silent for
a while. The scene around him was a beautiful
one. From Compton Prior, going upstream,
the River Dibbin swings round a bend into a
fairly straight piece of water as far as Mel-
sham?s Mill. Thereafter it twists about through
pretty meadows to the foot of a tree-capped
down, beyond this narrowing considerably un-
til it reaches Ringbury, with occasional pools
that are the haunts of anglers.
On a bright day, the stream offers much to
please the eye. On either side are the water-
meadows, with their splendid red and white
cattle that yield the best milk in that portion
of England; behind them, to the east, are the
depths of the woods, lighted up by the sun in
varying shades of green w r hich dull into farther
blackness. Bv the banks of the river are tall
�/
rushes and reeds, the home of waterfowl that
scurry off startled at the approach of a boat. In
the distance, with their patchwork of dark
green, yellow and brown, are the low, rounded
hills of the Downs, a rampart to the valley of
the Dibbin.
It was all peaceful and delighting to the eye,
a scene typical of the South Country, and Karl
appreciated its beauty as he looked around him.
This was just what Mr. Campion had tried to
picture for him in those long, quiet talks they
had had together in Altburg after work was
done for the day.
?You love your great mountains, Karl,? he
had said, ?and rightly so. ?As the tollmen


desire the hills?? one of our poets has hit it
off exactly?and I love them, too. They are
grand, rugged, majestic in their aspect. But
at times I feel them overpowering, especially
when the stormclouds hang over them and
make them black and menacing. I should like
you to see some corners of my country Surrey
and Sussex and Hampshire, and that glorious
Devon land where I was brought up as a boy.
They have beauties of their own which you
must see in order properly to appreciate the
constant variety of tree and shrub, of wild
flower in field and hedgerow, of luscious grasses
in the meadows, all full of colour and grace.
No other country in the world has so many
varied charms of Nature as has England.
And then he had talked to the boy of the
wonders of the countryside, until he had aroused
in him a great longing to see this beautiful
land with his own eyes. Now he was actually
here; and he was not disappointed. Compton
Prior lay in a setting that might be counted
among the fairest gems of this South Country.
?Tea at Mother Potter?s, I vote.? Wen-
ham?s voice interrupted Karl?s musings.
?Righto!? responded Lorrimer. ?We?ll
ease up a bit here; there?s plenty of time.?
He let the boat drift nearer to the reeds, and
a waterhen scudded noisily across the water at
their intrusion into her domain. As they rested
here a four-oared skiff full of Lower School
boys passed them on its way downstream. The
juniors greeted them with merry salutations.


Hello, Lorry! Givin? Carlo a wettin???
came the hail. ? ?Good dog! Good dog, Carlo ! ?
The Captain grinned back cheerfully at the
occupants of the skiff.
?Cheeky young beggars!? he remarked.
?Your Serene Highness must forgive them.
The Lower School is no respecter of persons.?
?Jolly young beggars, I call them,? laughed
Karl. ?Just the kind I can imagine you to
have been, Paul, years ago.?
Wenham gave a snort. ?Don?t you pry into
Lorrimer?s past, old son, he said; it won t
bear inspection. But I could tell you one or
two things about our estimable Captain that
would surprise you. Don?t you place him on
too high a pedestal, Karl! He?s not been
actually convicted ??
Toby ducked his head quickly to avoid the
handful of water which the Captain flung in
his face, and the boat rocked at this change of
pleasantries. But any disclosure that Wenham
might have been tempted to make was silenced
by Lorrimer?s taking up the oars again and
pulling the skiff out into mid-stream. They
followed the river for some distance and finally
drew alongside the little landing-stage by
Potter?s Cottage, a favourite resort for Comp-
ton Prior boys.
Half a dozen fellows were already in the ad-
joining garden having tea and cake.
After Mrs. Potter and her two daughters
had supplied refreshment the three seniors be-
took themselves to an arbour overlooking the


river, to enjoy a laze before returning to the
school. It was now that Wenham referred to
the exciting experience of the Badger and his
associates as recorded in the preceding chap-
ter. They laughed over the version of ?the
ghost in the cellars? that had reached their
ears. Karl, who had just an inkling of the
ghostly tradition of the school, was more inter-
ested than either of the others and his
questions at last aroused the ?Prior? editor
from his lethargy.
?You ought to know all about our jolly old
spectre, Karl,? he remarked. ?He?s a top-
hole, thoroughly-well-vouchsafed-for ghost ?
A.l. at Lloyds and all that. Would you like
to hear his story??
?I would.? Karl?s face was all eagerness,
for something of the romance of Compton Prior
had stirred his imagination.
?Well, I only know the story as I?ve dug it
up from books, of course,? said Wenham; ?but
I?ve got it pretty pat. I?m writing up some-
thing about it for the mag., you know. Sit
tight, and I?ll spin the yarn.?
?Right back in the days of the seventh Henry
?not the Mormon Henry, but his father ?the
head of the old Priory was a monk called
Anselin. He wasn?t half a bad chap as Priors
go; I mean, he wasn?t notorious for grinding
the poor and wasting his substance in riotous
living, like other priors and abbots did. This
Anselin just wanted to live quietly, at peace
with his neighbours. Compton Priory must


have been a jolly fine place in those old times
and the monks made a good thing out of it. It
was an English monastery, mind you, not one
of those alien shows which were a real disgrace
to the Church and which started the rows lead-
ing to their downfall. Anselin was a Sussex
man, and all his monks were Englishmen. The
histories say that they all lived good lives and
were beloved by the country folk round about.
The only fly in "the ointment seems to have been
the local lord of the manor, one of the Dalyng-
ton family, now died out. Sir Roger Dalyngton
was a bit of a lad, so to speak, but he didn't
interfere with the monks at the Priory so long
as they didn't worry him.
??All went along well until Sir Roger one
day had a guest from town to stay with him at
the Hall. You?ve seen the ruins of the old
house, along the Bournewick road, haven't
you??
Karl nodded. He remembered having had
pointed out to him the old home of the Dalyng-
tons.
?This visitor from town was another lad of
the village, a real ?blood?; he and Sir Roger were
boon companions up in London, and I expect
they had hectic times together there. When
Sir Darcy Monceau struck Compton Prior he
started in to make things hum in the quiet old
place. He stirred up Sir Roger to some extent
and got him going. The Hall saw some great
goings on, what with balls and masquerades,
hunting, bull-baiting, and so on. I can lend


you Corbett?s book on the period, if you want to
know the sort of games they had. And then
came the trouble with the priory.
?One day ?or rather, evening?Sir Darcy
and Sir Roger came back home from a hunt in
the woods out Middlesham way. They had
had good sport, let us say, and plenty of good
wine by way of celebration afterwards. As
they rode through one of the farms on the out-
skirts of the village Sir Darcy had a row with
a man over some trifling matter and started
in to flog him. The man wasn?t going to stand
for this, even from a great lord from London
Town, and he put up a fight. The upshot was
that he floored Sir Darcy very neatly and then
ran for it. That put the fat in the fire. When
Sir Darcy came to his senses he swore he would
have the" fellow?s hide, and he and Sir Roger
gave chase. The poor chap, however, had got
a good start, and when they sighted him he was
just running through the gateway of the
Priory. The two knights dashed up with their
men, but the door was barred and no one would
let them through. They thundered at the door
and shouted, demanding that the monks should
give up the villain who had dared to lay hands
on the sacred person of Sir Darcy Monceau,
but it was all of no avail. The stout old Prior
(he was a tall, lean chap really), wouldn?t budge
an inch. He just threatened Sir Roger and
his friend with the most terrible things?curses,
I suppose ?if they dared to profane the sacred
precincts. You see, the flying man had sought


and gained sanctuary, and it was pretty dan-
gerous in those times to violate that.
?So Sir Roger at last induced his companion
to give up the chase and return to the Hall.
The old Squire knew jolly well that the monks
could make it hot for him if he let Sir Darcy
do any mad thing, and there was the fact that
the country people all about were far more
solid for Anselm and his monks than they were
for him. I?ll bet Sir Darcy cursed a lot, but he
had to give in. They rode back to the Hall,
and the old Prior kept the man safe who had
claimed sanctuary, and I suppose helped him
to escape eventually. Anyway, there's nothing
more said about him. The next move in the
game came when Sir Darcy Monceau went
back to town. This rebuff from the monks
rankled in his mind, and he wasn?t the sort of
chap who would sit down under it. He deter-
mined to get even with the Prior by hook or
by crook, and he pretty soon did it. It was
by crook, too.
?As Lorry can tell you better than I can, the
Church in those days wasn't in the best of
favour. We don?t want to go into a lot of his-
tory, but if you?ve listened to old Atterbury
you?ll remember how corrupt the monasteries
had become by that time. They had grown
very wealthy and powerful generally, and that
meant a lot of enmity against them. To cut
the story short, Sir Darcy had strong friends
at Court who were ready to fall in with his
plans. He was a first-class old scoundrel, and


a bad friend for Sir Roger to have picked up.
A few months after the quarrel with the monks
a high personage from London came down to
Compton Prior to hold an enquiry into the
state of the Monastery. It was a rotten busi-
ness, of course, a put-up job. The jury was
?packed,? if you know what that means, Karl.
The good old Prior hadn?t a chance from the
first, and after the report had been made orders
were sent out for the suppression of the place.
?Then a big sort of war started: Church
against State. ' The Prior had his powerful
friends, and he fought hard to get justice done
to preserve his Priory. Things went on like
this for a longish time; Sir Darcy up in London
pulling all the strings he could to bring about
Anselm?s downfall, and the Prior checking him
here and there with his influence. Down at the
Priory nothing happened; monks went on doing
their work and living peaceably. You might
have thought that all the trouble had blown
over and that there was nothing to be afraid
of.
?Then one night ?here we come to the real
star part of the yarn ?a party of armed men
appeared at the Priory?s gates and forced their
way in. It is said by some writers that Mon-
ceau was one of the raiders. However, whether
he was there or not, the attacking party set
about their business quickly enough. The poor
old monks were sent flying, the Priory was
plundered, and some parts of it were fired.
The chief object of the raid, however, was the


Prior himself. One of the books I read sa\s
that the leader of the party?it was Monceau,
he declares ?barged all over the place calling
for Anselin to show himself. But the Prior
couldn?t be found. Some of the monks had
shut themselves into a corner of one of the
buildings and were putting up a strenuous
fight. Not bad for them. I don?t seewhy even
a monk shouldn?t show fight when he?s jumped
on like that.?
?And they could, too,? interjected Lorri-
mer. ?You?ve only to read Hereward the
Wake? to know that. Go on, Toby; sorry I
interrupted you.?
?All serene,? replied Wenham. ?I m afraid
I?m making a long yarn of it, but I want Karl
to know the rights and wrongs of it all. This
is what happened next. Old Sir Darcy (I m
pretty well convinced, myself, that he was in
it) led the assault on this last defence, and it
wasn?t long before he and his men won through.
They killed several of the monks, of course,
but after all, they couldn't lay hands on Anse-
lin. Then they collared one poor chap ?
more of a servant than a monk ?and tortured
him to make him tell where the Prior
was hiding. What they got out of him was
that Anselin might be found in the Chapel.
So they hiked across in a body and broke into
the place.?
?Why, that was like St. Thomas a Becket.
wasn?t it?? said Karl. ?I know the story of
that.?


?Good man.? Toby nodded. ?He?s
learning our history, isn?t he, Lorry ? Yes,
Karl, it was rather on the lines of the Becket
affair. When Sir Darcy burst into the Chapel
there was the Prior on his knees before the
altar, and they killed him on the spot. Then
?as that was the principal thing they had
come down for ?they left the priory to burn
and set off back to London.?
Toby paused as if he had finished, but Lorri-
mer took up the story.
?I don?t know as much about it as you do,
Toby,? he said, ?but wasn?t there some mys-
tery connected with the Priory murder ? I
seem to remember hearing something about it.?
?You?re right,? replied Wenham. ?I was
coming to that. A kind of postscript, and
that?s generally more interesting than the let-
ter itself. There was a mystery. After the
i/
raiding party had gone, those of the monks
who were aliye ventured to leave their hiding-
places. They stole out one by one, and they
came to the Chapel to see the end of the tragedy.
With them were a few of the village folk, and
they picked up the body of the dead Prior and
carried it back to his quarters to prepare it for
burial. And then came the discovery. It
wasn?t the Prior at all who had been killed.
The face of the dead man, when they pulled
back the hood, was the face of Brother Martin,
a tall monk of much the same size and figure
as Anselin himself! Then thev understood
what had happened. Soon after the attack,


Brother Martin must have induced, or com-
pelled, the Prior to change clothes with him.
No doubt he got the Prior safely out and away
from the buildings; there?s nothing to show how
he did it; but old Anselm did disappear. He
wasn?t among those who had been killed, and
he never showed up afterwards. In some way
or other he got away. I like to think myself,
that he was carried oft by force, by those who
loved him; I don?t think he was a coward to
bunk of! and leave the others to their fate.
?Anvhow, it was Brother Martin who did
the brave thing. He posed as the Prior im '
self and he waited there in the Monastery
Chapel, knowing jolly well that they would
find him in due time. And he let himself be
killed to save his chief. A jolly plucky and
fine deed, I call it. They ought to have made
him a Saint for it; perhaps they did_ ? And
that?s the story of our ghost, Karl. It s the
restless spirit of old Brother Martin that hovers
about Compton Prior, they say, calling for
vengeance upon the villains who slew him. i
ought to tell you that some authorities will
have it that the Prior himself was really mur-
dered. But I?m going to plump for the Martin
yarn. It?s got good foundation, and it makes
what the guv nor would call a better news-
story. You look out for my screed in the mag.
next month. My hat, Lorry, all this spouting
has made me thirsty. What about some pop
before we start??


By the time they were ready to leave, the
other Compton Priorites who had made the
same journey to Potter?s Cottage had taken
their departure. They got into the skiff and
pushed off under the admiring gaze of Mother
Potter's two youngest.
�? o
Karl was silent; as, too, was Wenham. The
latter was musing over the story he had just
related and making mental notes of the points
to be enlarged upon in his Trior? contribu-
tion. It was Lorrimer, pulling at a steady, easy
pace, who started the conversation.
?That?s a really fine yarn. Toby,? he re-
marked. ?The sort of thing I?d like to write
up myself. It does stir one, that quiet, splen-
did heroism.?
Toby came out of his reverie. ?You?re right,
Lorry. It?s in the ?Stand and be still to the
Birkenhead drill class. That old monk Martin
was a top-hole hero. He ought to have a
memorial put up to him somewhere in the
school.?
?My uncle?he s in the Army, as you know
?has told me several stories about how the
V .C. has been won, Lorrimer went on. ?And
so often, you know, the fellow who won the
Cross was pretty much out of himself with ex-
citement when he went slap-dash at the enemy
and captured a gun single-handed, or did some-
thing equally daring. But this facing death in
cold blood, going to the sacrifice, so to speak?
that seems to me a bigger thing. Eh, Karl ??


Thus addressed, Karl turned his head round
to the Captain. ?I agree with you. Paul, he
said ?But your monk may have thought more
Of the Church than of the Prior. I was thmk-
inrr iust now that he may have offered his li
in the hope that it would save the Monastery
from destruction. It was this Anselm that they
wanted so much to kill, wasnt it. And as
they meant death, he just gave himself instead
of the other. Men will do that for their faith,
for their Church. Yes, it was fine, all the
same.? . . . ~
?I?m not looking at it quite that way, re-
turned Toby. ?I?m going to make it a personal
thing ?loyalty and sheer love for his superior.
?Greater love hath no man than this?? you
know. That?s my text for the Prior.
Lorrimer rested on his oars for a minute.
?I know what Karl has in mind, he said,
?It?s like love of country, patriotism, eh??
Karl smiled back at his friend. ?I mean
that,? he said simply. ?If you love your
country very, very much there is no sacrifice
too great that vou could make for it.
?Go on,? Toby interjected. ?Tell us about
William Tell, and?and Arnold von Winkel-
ried?and the rest. It?s getting quite a history
lesson, isn?t it??
Lorrimer gave a laugh and let his oars drop
into the water again.
?Never mind Toby, Karl. I understand your
point of view. And you?re quite likely to be
right. Let?s think of that old monk Martin


as a simple-minded chap who hadn?t any as-
pirations to heroism, who didn?t know he had
the stuff in him until the moment came for him
to do what he thought to be his duty. He?s
o
none the less a hero for that. I wonder how
many of us would come up to the scratch as
he did? It?s one thing talking about it, and
another thing doing it!?
?How do you feel about it yourself, Karl??
Toby grinned to the latter. ?What?s your
Altburg done for you to make you another
Martin, eh??
?Ah, Altburg!? Karl?s face seemed to glow
as he spoke, and his voice sank almost to a
whisper as he said again, ?Altburg!?
But at this moment, entering the level stretch
of water below the mill, Wenham caught sight
of another boat not many lengths in front of
them.
?Lorry!? he cried. ?There?s Parkyn and
Mason just ahead. Let?s give ?em a race down
to the bridge. Ahoy, there!?
His shout drew the attention of the two
Kirkeite prefects, and the sudden spurt that
Lorrimer made told them of the intention of
the Schoolhouse boat. Nothing more was said
as the School Captain bent to his work and
drove the skiff swiftly through the water. It
was a gallant effort, but Parkyn was a good
oarsman himself, and the start that his craft
had obtained told in the end. The Kirkeites
gained the bridge and the landing-place an easy
first.


Arm in arm the trio, with Parkyn and Mason
accompanying them, swung up the hill to the
school The subject of their recent discussion
was forgotten for the time, but that conversa-
tion about heroism was to recur to the minds
of Lorrimer and Wenham more than once in
the eventful days to follow.
CHAPTER V.
A Sign of Trouble.
The story of the ghost in the cellars in the
meanwhile had spread rapidly throughout the
school and it lost nothing in the telling. Pot-
tlewell?s industry in this direction was notable.
He was particular as to the exact tone, as well
as the exact words, used by the spirit of the
old Prior who haunted the Gideon quarter.
For a time he re-enacted the scene to admiring
audiences, among whom Merrick and Johnson
occasionally figured. The three were hugely
delighted with the success of their scheme
While to many of the School the Juniors?
scare was subject for mirth and incredulity, to
others it afforded no little serious thought. The
more superstitious fostered the belief that the
?monk was walking?? in actual fact, and that
it portended some notable happenings.
?I put it down to a silly jape on the part of
some fellows,? said Lorrimer, as he, Wenham
and a few intimates discussed the event one day


in the Captain?s study. ?The juniors were
obviously up to some game hiding down there
in the cellars. I?ll sound my fag, Belton, about
it. Some chap got wind of it and spoofed ?em.
Don?t vou think so??
?Pretty likely, I should say,? agreed
Wenham, ?but don?t spread the sceptic theory
too quickly, old man. I want to make a good
story of the thing in the next number of the
?Prior.? As I told you, we may draw a letter
from the Spiritualist crowd, you know. My
guv?nor says a good correspondence column
is always a strong feature to run.?
?Good old editor,? laughed Parkyn. ?Let
Kirke?s down lightly, won?t you? The Bad-
ger?s a sensitive little soul ?I haven?t had him
as a fag for nothing?and the Microbe would
die of chagrin if the prize story of his life were
destroyed.?
?I?ll tell you one thing,? put in Parr-Smith,
the new Schoolhouse prefect; ?keep your eye
on Pottlewell. The young beggar?s much too
ardent about the business for my liking. I
think he knows more than he would admit.?
?Too much zeal, Mr. Simple,? observed
Tobv. ?We?ll watch young Potty, as you say.
But leave me a month or so for my scoop.?
The while these confidences were being ex-
changed, Michael Power, junior and visionary,
was at work immortalising the recent startling
occurrence in verse. For a long time the
Microbe had nursed the ambition to appear in
print in the columns of the School Magazine.


Now the effect of his experience in the cellars
was to inspire him to the creation of an ode to
the ghostly visitant.
� ?Lines'Written Upon Hearing the Voice
of the Ghost Monk Prior.
?Bv Michael Power.?
He sat in the shade of the hedge at the bot-
tom of the Junior Playing Field, having
selected the farther side so as to be free from
interruption. Before him a stretch of the JJib-
bin sparkled in the afternoon sun. It was
Wednesday, and the majority of the school were
at cricket. The Microbe cut no figure at the
game and the shouts of the players far behind
left him unmoved. On the river a few
boats passed to and fro with merry occupants.
The embryo poet sucked his pencil thought-
fully, oblivious to a waving hand from a skiff
manned by four athletic Kirkeites.
? Shorn dim the moon o?er Compton s hory pile.
Where scholars many a hundred weery toil ??
He paused at this second line to consider the
matter of rhyme. With a little broadening of
the vowel ?pile? could be brought into line with
?toil,? though his innate artistic sense revolted
at the combination.
?Smile? certainly suggested itself, but this
came abruptly into conflict with his regard for
the truth.
?While, mile, stile?? he mused, but no word
offered itself as a substitute, so he let the lines
stand.
? Her butteress?d towers thy spirrit knew so well,
In histry famed since?since Henry?s fair Quen fell.?


?Which Queen was it, now?? the Microbe
asked himself. Henry the Eighth had had so
many and it was important to know which
consort shared the throne at the precise time of
the School?s foundation. He made a note on
his paper; ?Query, look up Henry Quens.?
Then he addressed himself again to his task.
? Thou ghostly pryor,?
but dissatisfied with this he wrote tentatively:
? Thou troubled spirrit of the Pryory,?
and was considering the difficulties of selecting a
rhyme to the last word when his meditations
were rudely interrupted. From somewhere be-
hind him, in the field itself, rose the voice of one
in anguish, the voice of the Badger, in fact tear-
ful and protestant.
?Let me go, you beast! Let me go, I say!
Ouch!?
Stuffing his pencil and paper into his pocket
the Microbe rose hastily and peered through
an opening in the hedge. Thence he saw his
chum, the Badger, in the relentless grasp of
Mabberley, who had gripped the small boy?s left
arm and was twisting it with cruel intent.
Shotter stood by with a grin on his face.
This corner of the field dropped consider-
ably, and was cut off from the greater portion
wherein the cricketers were busily engaged at
the nets. The two bullies had been careful in
their choice of venue.
?Say he?s a Hun, you young beggar, will
you ? A Hun ?a rotten German swine. Do you
hear ??


I wont,? declared the Badger as stoutly
as the pain would allow. ?He?s a jaguar?l
heard him say so?he isn?t a Hun, I tell you.
?He i s ?he is?he is ! Say he?s a Hun! Do
you hear me ? ?
Mabberley gave the arm in his grasp another
twist and the Badger, though he pluckily strove
to repress it, gave vent to a sharp cry.
The Microbe?s face grew white. ?The filthy
beasts!? he ejaculated to himself. Then, keep-
ing close to the hedge, he set off at a run to
find help. ,
As luck would have it, he didn t have to go
far. Down by the river bank, near to the little
stone bridge that spanned the Dibbin and car-
ried the road across, he spied Karl von Altburg
walking with Toby Wenham. Both were in
flannels and were no doubt contemplating a
row on the stream. The Microbe made for
them with the speed of an express engine and
something of its noise.
?Hello, young Power,? was Toby?s greeting.
?What?s the excitement? Got another poem
off your chest??
?Yes, Wenham ?I mean no, Wenham?
it?s ?it?s?? he stopped to get his breath. ?It?s
the Badger ?Badgerley ?they?ve got him in a
corner over there,? ?he waved an arm wildly
??an? they?re breaking his arm, Wenham!?
?Who?? asked Toby sharply.
?Shotter and Mabberley,? explained the
small boy. ?They?re bullying him fright-


fully! ? ? and a tear started into his eye as he
faltered the words.
?Come on, Karl, we?ll look into this,? said
Wenham, and the two turned sharply off away
from the river, with the Microbe leading the
way like a terrier.
The Badger had had about enough of it when
the two seniors arrived on the scene. He was
on his knees now, begging tearfully to be let
off, and his face was even whiter than the
Microbe?s.
Toby Wenham plunged through a gap in the
hedge, followed by Karl and the Junior, and
confronted the two bullies.
?Drop that, Mabberley?quick!? he said.
You dirty blackguard!?
He ran up to the Badger, who had collapsed
on the ground, crying bitterly.
Mabberley?s big, bovine face took on an ugly
look. Shotter shifted about uneasily.
"What?s the trouble?? asked Toby. ?What
was the Badger doing to deserve this??
The Kirkeite junior answered for himself.
It was Karl," he explained in a broken
voice. ?They tried to make me say?he was?
a Hun?but I wouldn?t!?l didn?t, Wenham?
though the brute tried all he could !?
Hallo, Karl," said Toby, turning to his
friend, ? you?re in this. Well, Mabberley,?
he added, ? what have you got to say? Spit
it out! ? ?
The young beggar was cheeky?that?s all,?
growled the Bounder. ?I just gave him a bit


of gyp for his sauce. He isn?t as hurt as he
makes out, by along chalk.?
?We?ll see about that, said Toby, quietly.
?So it was the old Hun trouble, eh? } Well,
Karl himself is here now; put it to him.?
?Go to blazes!? retorted Mabberley angrily.
?I?ve no truck with your German friends. For
two pins I?d kick him out of the place.
Mabberley overtopped the ? Prior ? editor
by three inches, and he was of much heavier
build. If it came to trouble with Wenham ?to
a trial of strength?he was confident of the is-
sue. He stood far more in dread of the other s
bitter tongue than of his fists, and the sight of
Toby?s tense face and blazing eyes made him
feel somewhat uncomfortable.
Karl, who had been a silent spectator until
now, suddenly intervened.
?There will be no kicking me, he said
gravely. ? I will not allow you. Let me
tell you again, too, that I am no German as you
say. lam a Magyar ?
?The Badger said you were a jaguar,? broke
in the Microbe impulsively. ?We couldn?t
make out ?
?I am a Magyar,? continued Karl in the
same even tone, ?and I will not be called a
German. Understand that, please!?
?Understand my hat!? responded the Boun-
der, whose temper had risen with this interrup-
tion to his sport. ?German ?see! Hun!
Hun! Hun!? And advancing close to Karl he
spat contemptuously at the other?s feet.


Von Altburg?s right arm shot out; his fist
caught Mabberley full in the mouth and the lat-
ter reeled unsteadily backward. His face now
livid with rage, the bully recovered himself and
plunged forward to the attack. But his anti-
cipation of a speedy victory was shortlived. In
another instant he found himself on the defence
instead of being the attacker. Blows rained
fast and furious upon him, and the few hits
that he succeeded in scoring himself apparently
made no impression upon his opponent.
There is no need to describe the course of the
combat. Suffice it to say that the Bounder re-
ceived a well-deserved thrashing?one that left
him cowed and whimpering on the ground, his
face bearing ample evidence of the punishment
he had taken.
At the beginning of the fight Wenham had
motioned Shotter to stand aside, but the bad
egg of the Upper Fifth had no stomach for this
sort of thing. It was Mabberley?s funeral; let
him go on with it.
From the river two other people had been un-
observed spectators of the affair. Mr. Campion
was pulling a two-oared skiff upstream, with
Mr. Gideon as passenger, when the latter called
his fellow-master?s attention to the group.
Campion?? he exclaimed, point-
ing. ?There?s a fight on. Ought we to pull
in ??
?Er?on second thoughts, no,? said the
other. ?It appears to be Von Altburg and
Mabberley in conflict. We masters find it best


to be discreetly blind at times, you know and
this seems to me a fitting opportunity, 1 know
the bad blood there is between certain parties.
Let them alone, Gideon; they?ll settle things
best themselves. And if I?m not mistaken, our
friend Mabberley will find that he?s caught a
Tartar ? or else I?ve been a bad coach tor
Karl.?
Mr. Campion bent to his oars again and the
boat shot round the bend of the river. The
two masters, therefore, were unaware of the
conclusion of the fight.
By the Badger and the Microbe the wholesale
defeat of their enemy was hailed with un-
bounded delight. To this was added a full
meed of admiration for the skill displaced by
Karl.
?Crikey!? said the Badger later, when re-
counting the incident to a group of his fo -
lowers, ? just knocked the Bounder all over
the shop, he did. Hit him when he pleased.
That chap can box if you like. I?ll back
him against anybody in the school. You oug
to have seen him! An? so jolly quiet throug
it all, too. Serene Highness, he?s called, isn t
he, when he?s home? Well, he was all serene
this time. Hot a word! Just smack, smack
smack! ? ?
It was with the same quietness of manner
that Karl turned from the prostrate Mabberley
to take Wenham?s arm as they moved off to-
gether. Toby gave a parting piece of advice.


?You kids cut up to the School; you can tea
in my study, if you like. But don't make too
big a mess of it, will you ? As for you, Mab-
berley, go and wash that filthy-lookmg face of
yours and get a piece of raw meat for your eve.
Much good the lesson?ll do you, I expect.
Timeo Danaos,? Bounder; which, being inter-
preted, is: ? Keep clear of Magyars?! So
long!?
?My aunt. Karl!? remarked Toby as the two
made their way back towards the bridge.
You're pretty useful with the dooks, aren?t
you??
t/
Docks- Karl looked at his companion
with a quizzical smile. ? Are they hands?
fists? Yes?" He gave a little laugh. ?Ah.
I have to thank Mr. Campion for that. Yes,
he used to teach me to box, and my cousin, too.
My cousin is Karl, also; he is even better with
the?dooks. than I am.?
?Good chap." commented Toby. ?You see,
it was a real surprise for Comrade Gregory.
You being a foreigner he reckoned you'd know
nothing about fighting as we fight. Great
snakes! I wouldn't have missed it for any-
thing ! But you've made an enemy for life,
Karl, make no mistake about that. The
Bounder will never forgive you for that hid-
ing.?
Karl s face expressed supreme contempt.
Bah!? he said, with a gesture of disgust.
?In Cheritza my servants would have beaten
him. I was wrong to have used my own hands.


But I was angry. Yes, he was very cruel to
young Badgerley and I felt angry. Then he in-
sulted me. Come, let us forget it. I am not
in the mood for the river. Shall we walk in-
stead??
Toby was quite willing, so the two crossed
the river by the bridge and proceeded seawards
along the Bournewick road. As they passed
the ? Priory Inn. at the end of the bridge,
a solitary figure detached itself from the door-
way and followed leisurely after them.
?Rum looking cove,? observed Wenham,
noting the man's badly-cut clotnes and the
curious foreign cap with a peak that he wore.
Karl smiled. ? That is Franz?my ser-
vant,? he explained. ?He would come to
England with me, the faithful Franz. He is
very, very attached to me.?
?Like taking a dog for a walk with you,?
laughed Wenham. ? Let him come by all
means, old man; I shan?t worry.?
With Franz at a respectful distance at the
rear, the two friends held on their way along
the high road in the pleasant May sunshine.
There was just a crisp touch in the air, enough
to make one step out briskly. As they walked
their conversation ran lightly upon school
topics, upon the masters, the boys, and coming
events in the nature of matches and examina-
tions. Toby chatted about his pet, the
? Prior,? of the great story he was going to
write respecting the ghost in the cellars, and


then of the miscellaneous contributions he was
accustomed to receive from fellows generally.
?That shrimp, the Microbe, for instance,?
he observed; ? you wouldn?t suspect it, Karl,
but the young beggar?s mad on poetry. You
ought to see some of the tosh he slings me for
the mag. I?ll bet a quid he was writing verse
when he was lying under the hedge wdiile the
Badger was getting mauled. Now he?ll be
doing a grand ode on the battle between you and
the Bounder. My hat! how he?ll let himself
go! You?ve made a couple of allies there, old
chap. And, frankly, I?d a long sight rather
have the Badger on my side than against me.
He and his Tong ?you ought to have been here
last term ?can make things jolly uncomfort-
able for you if they fancy it.
?I say,? he added, ? what a topping day!
Do you have this kind of May weather in your
Altburg ??
Karl regarded the landscape with a medita-
tive eve. ?We have more rain at this time of
t/
the year,? he said. ?And it is colder. But
it is all beautiful if you love your country. I
love Altburg, Toby; it is the most glorious coun-
try in the world. There are high mountains
there, and great rocks on which we shoot goats
and wild sheep. And in the forests there are
boars ?great tusked boars which you ride down
and spear. That is fine sport.?
His face flushed as he spoke of his Balkan
home Cheritza! The city of the Princes?


palace? how long would it be before he saw it
again ? ,
?Toby,? he added, ? you must come there
some day, to see it, my home at Cheritza. You
and Lorrimer?l want you and Paul to see it.
You are my two friends.? He pressed Toby s
arm affectionately.
?Bet your life,? replied his companion.
?Say the word, Karl, and we?ll come right
along to shoot all your blessed mountain sheep
to bits. I?ve never stuck a boar myself, and i
don't think Lorry has, either. But we 11 have
a shot at it. Rotten luck we couldn t bring
Lorry with us to-day. He?s got to turn out at
the nets. And I expect he?ll have ago at ten-
nis on the hard court afterwards.?
?Paul would think of his duty to the school
first, of course,? commented Karl. He stopped
as he spoke and bent forward to examine some
prettv wild flowers that grew on the roadside
bank" At this point they were passing a copse
of pine trees that graced the foot of a fairly
steep hill. Suddenly, without warning, a man
darted forward from the nearest trees. He
held what appeared to Wenham to be a short
cudgel in his hand. Springing to the top of
the bank, he leant over and struck fiercely at
the bent figure below him.
?Karl!? , , ,
At Wenham?s quick cry the boy made a
movement and the blow caught him on the side
of the head, glancing thence to his shoulder.
He gave a groan, clutched wildly at the grass,


and slipped limply to the ground. The man
above, without looking to see the result of his
blow, turned swiftly and regained the shelter of
the trees.
Wenham flung himself by his friend?s side,
and a moment later Franz ran up, breathing
heavily, to take the injured boy's head on his
knee.
??Highness!? he moaned in a guttural voice,
speaking in a strange tongue that Toby could
not follow.
Then, muttering quickly to himself, he drew
a revolver from his pocket, and sprang agilely
up the bank. Toby heard him as he plunged
among the undergrowth, and heard, too, a few
moments after, the sound of a pistol-shot.
The servant rejoined him shortly, still breath-
ing hard and muttering what was presumably
inTprecations in his own language. _ Franz?s
command of English was little, but in his halt-
ing way he managed to make Wenham under-
stand that the miscreant had disappeared, that
his search had been in vain.
Together they stanched the blood that ran
freely from the stricken boy?s head. Toby fetch-
ing water from a rivulet that ran near by. Karl
began to recover consciousness as they
tended him, and Franz, drawing a flask from
his pocket, pressed a few drops of the spirit
to his lips.
After some ten minutes the boy came to him-
self. but he could do little more than hold his


hands to his bandaged head and moan pitifully.
Then, together, Toby and Franz supporting
him on either side, they made their way slowly
back to the school.
CHAPTER VI.
In The Editor?s Sanctum.
It usually falls to the lot of the chronicler of
school history to be more concerned with the
doings of a select number of individuals, mas-
ters and boys, than with the equally important
but more prosaic matters such as school work,
examinations, etc. The present chronicler is
no exception to the rule. The fortunes of Karl
von Altburg and his immediate circle of friends
have first claim upon our attention, while at
the same time we cannot neglect certain other
minor personages at Compton Prior with whose
doings we are almost as directly concerned.
It is not to be supposed, therefore, that the
course of scholastic progress had been greatly
interrupted by the events just narrated. Much
might be written, did time allow, of the w T ork in
class-room and study, of the keenness displayed
in the competition for the Maxwell Scholar-
ship, the Elphinstone Exhibition, the Gover-
nor?s Gold Medal for Classics, and other
coveted awards. In this respect life at Comp-
ton Prior ran on in its wonted way, together
with all the customary activities in the field of
sport.


Of more immediate interest to us is the new
situation created by the dastardly attack upon
Karl, related in the preceding chapter. The
news of this circulated throughout the school
like wildfire upon the arrival of the party at the
gates. For the moment the case of Mabberley,
bruised and cowed, became a trifling incident.
While the injured boy was put to bed in the
Sanatorium to receive medical attention, the
police were promptly notified of the affair. The
telephone* was busy in all directions, cyclist
scouts scoured the district; but the fact that
neither Wenham nor Franz could give any de-
tailed description of the assailant added greatly
to the difficulties of the pursuit. Hour after
hour went by with no message that any clue had
been obtained.
To everybody?s relief the injury to Karl?s
head was not so serious as had been at first sup-
posed. The force of the blow had been lessened
owing to its glancing nature. It was a bad
contusion, however, and the boy lay delirious
for a considerable time.
On the following day Mr. Campion was per-
mitted to see him. There was no doubt in the
master?s mind as to the significance of the at-
tack. He saw in it the hand of the enemy to
whom Karl?s life was a menace, the enemy who,
in Altburg or in England, would be relentless
in his pursuit.
? The first blow, my poor boy,? said Mr.
Campion, holding Karl?s fevered hand in his
grasp. ? Thank heaven it failed in its at-

Otto ?or rather his tools ?are here. As we
knew they would, they have run you to earth,
though more quickly than I thought would be
the case. We can do nothing now but wait ?
wait until the arch-enemy show?s himself in the
open. Can you wait, Karl? Will you go for-
ward still ?with the risk??
The boy smiled wanly and his fingers pressed
the master?s hand. ? There is no turning back,
sir,? he replied. ?It is for Altburg. We go
forward. lam content. Let Otto do wdiat he
will ?we?ll fight him, sir, w r on?t we??
? Good man,? muttered Mr. Campion, look-
ing at the white but resolute face of the boy,
?it?s a fight worth having. But if they suc-
ceed with you, Karl, lad,? he told himself,
?it will break my heart. God guard you and
keep you safe ! ? ?
Until the doctor relaxed his orders neither
Lorrimer nor any other of Karl?s particular
friends was allowed acc ,ss to the sick chamber.
The School Captain went about with a
troubled face these days, for his affection for
the other had grown w-ith extraordinary
rapidity. He did not realise incidentallv how 7
much the Altburgian meant to him until this
accident deprived him of his chum?s society.
On the third day after the affair on the
Bournewick road, Lorrimer sought the sanc-
tum of the ? Prior ? editor. He had a free
hour between breakfast and First School. He
found Wenham at his desk, immersed in M.S.S.


and proofs, with fingers inkstained and with
hair unkempt. Toby tried to pattern himself
on a recollection of a busy sub-editor who had
caught his fancy during a visit to a London
evening newspaper office.
?Cheerio, skipper!? came the greeting.
? Hullo, editor, how goes it?? was the re-
sponse.
?Fine, thanks. This is going to be a jolly
good number, I think. Campion?s promised
me a special story about something he ran
against in Mespot. I say, Lorry, that chap?s
a D.S.O. Did you know it? The guv?nor
says. He remembered the story when I told
him Campion had joined the staff here; Captain
John Campion, D.5.0., he is.?
?Good man,? commented Lorrimer. ?He
looks that kind of chap, doesn't he, Toby. And
he?s not the sort to blow about it, either.?
? Then, there?s an article on ? Greek Plays ?
coming from the Reverend Septimus. Bit
heavy, I expect, but the Head likes that Classi-
cal splosh. I daren?t cut it, you know, or
Sep?d get his knife into me. Bates has written
an account of a walking tour up in Scotland,
by � The Old Tramp ??good pen-name for a
master, isn?t it? And dear old ? Stinks ? wants
me to let him discuss ? The Uses of a Labora-
tory.? And there?s lots of poetry. Here,
listen to this, Lorry. How?s this for the
Junior School laureate, my precious fag??
He picked up three badly-written sheets
heavily scored with erasions and corrections,


and read aloud several passages from the
Microbe?s ? Ode to the Ghost Monk.?
? Poor little Power!? he remarked, with a
broad grin. ? There?s a great mind working
there, Lorry. Infans vociferans ! I wonder
if there?s any cure for the disease? Oh, ye
gods, hear this ! Another ode ? � To Summer.
Lines Written in the Playing Fields at
Compton Prior School.?
Michael Power.
Hale, godess, Flora is thy name,
We welcome the with sport and game.
Now on the green sword see us gambol,
Or through the wudlands some of us ramble.
Hot is thy sun, shine on my mews??
?Bit catty, that, eh?? interposed Lorrimer,
taking the paper from Wenham?s hand, for the
editor?s unrestrained laughter interrupted his
reading.
? ?lnspire my pen to give the thy right dus.?
??Dus? Dus? What does the little beggar
mean??? Then Lorry joined his laugh to the
others. �� Oh, I get him. Dues, of course!
Well, print it, Toby, and offer a prize for the
best solution!?
?Absolutely priceless, isn?t it?? asked the
editor. ?And it?s not the only thing he?s sent,
either, beside the ghost stuff.?
?Ah, the old ghost yarn. How are you going
on with that, Toby ??
Wenham explained that he was dealing with
the ghost tradition historically, alluding to
well-known haunted houses in the south coun-
try, and going on to refer to the recent manifes-


tation at Compton Prior in a dignified manner,
in the hope that, as stated before, he would
draw some interesting correspondence on the
subject from the seriously-minded. ?Psychic
stuff?s all the go just now,? he added. ?I?d
like to see the ? Prior ? quoted in the papers.
?Startling apparition at English school,? ?Monk
Martin appears to Schoolboys,? kind of head-
ing. We?ll have to work it through the guv?-
_ _ _ 9 9
nor.
Mr. Campion, entering at this moment with
a large envelope in his hand, abruptly ter-
minated the conversation on this point.
?Your Mespot paper, Wenham,? he said.
?In good time, I hope. Let me see a proof,
won?t you. because of the foreign names. Good-
morning, Lorrimer. Karl?s getting on splen-
didly, you?ll be glad to know. I?ve just left him
and heard the nurse?s opinion. The cut is heal-
ing all right and the pain has lessened. About
that photo, Wenham. I can give you one of
Karl. You want to send it to your father, I
understand? It is not to be reproduced, of
course, without my sanction; but Mr. Wenham
is curious to see it, is he not ? Karl has no
objection, he says.?
? Thanks very much, sir,? replied Toby, as
he laid the master?s M.S. on his desk. ?You
see, sir, I happened to mention about Karl
coming here this term, and the guv?nor got
quite interested. I thought Karl wouldn?t
mind sending his portrait along when the guv?-
nor asked for it.?


Mr. Campion nodded and turned to the door.
There he paused, with his fingers on the handle.
?I just want to say this, you fellows,? he said,
and there was a trace of hesitation in his voice.
?The attack on Karl must seem very myster-
ious to you ?and there is the fact that he is of
the royal house of Altburg. You are both
great friends of his ?his best friends in the
school, he says ?and I wish I could tell you
what is behind all this. But ?at present I
can?t, boys. Don?t seek to know more yet.
Karl has" done nothing wrong?you will believe
that. He is involved in a tangle ?in a mesh of
circumstances ?that gives us cause for much
anxiety. Some time you will know all about it,
and then ?well, then I think you will have an
even greater regard for your friend than you
have now.?
He gave a kindly smile and another nod and
quitted the study.
?It is jolly mysterious, and that?s a fact!?
remarked Toby as the door closed behind the
master. ? I?d give something to know what?s
in the wind. It?s curious the guv?nor want-
ing to see his photo, too, isn?t it? I smell a
story, Lorry, a real newspaper story. There?s a
plot afoot ?Bolshies, perhaps, or some revolu-
tionaries in Altburg, eh? We live in stirring
times, and by the pricking of my thumbs
? somethin?s gwine to happen mighty soon,? as
the nigger said when the lynchers caught him.?
Lorrimer smiled, for Wenham?s humour was
infectious, but his face took on a serious aspect


the next moment. ? I don?t like it," he said.
? Karl?s in some danger, I should say. Else,
why should that chap make such a sudden at-
tack on him? He meant to lay him out ?
there?s no doubt of that. It was a murderous
blow. And he did it all so quickly?without
any hesitation. He must have been watching
you and Karl come up the road and waited his
time. Poor old Karl! Prince of Altburg!
Whatever rotten thing has turned up to worry
him???
?Uneasy lies the head ?? quoted Toby.
?You know the rest. But, as Campion says,
we may rest easy that Karl?s done nothing to
be ashamed of. Perhaps we shall learn some-
thing more pretty soon.??
Toby?s expectation was realised much earlier
than he anticipated. Three days after the des-
patch of Karl?s photograph to his father in
London there came a letter from the latter
which sent him post haste to Lorrimer?s study.
The School Captain had just finished tea,
and his fag, Belton, was busying himself with
the washing-up preparations. Ignoring the
presence of the Kirkeite junior, Toby plunged
straightway into his news.
?Here?s a pretty coil, as the Stevenson man
would say,?? he began. ?You know I sent
Karl?s picture along to the guv?nor, old man?
Well, he wanted to show it to Allison, that
journalist chap I told you of?the ? special ?on
the ? Record.? Allison wanted to see it very
particularly it seems, for he?s been engaged in


smelling out that Bolshy plot I heard bits about
in town. What do you think he told the guv?-
nor? ?lf that?s Prince Karl of Altburg,? he
said, ? then, he?s somewhere out in the Mediter-
ranean. The last I heard of him was at
Naples, a week ago.? ?
Lorry?s eyes looked amazement, and Toby,
conscious of the sensation he was making, con-
tinued :
?Well, don?t you see? Either our Karl
isn?t the Prince, or there?s someone personat-
ing him out there where Allison says ?in the
Mediterranean! What does it all mean??
Belton, all ears despite his assiduity in wip-
ing his master?s cup and saucer and plates,
noted this remarkable intelligence for future
consideration. The rattle that he made with
the crockery, however, recalled Lorrimer?s at-
tention to his fag.
?You can clear out, Belton,? he said curtly.
?Leave the other things till later. Scoot!?
Very reluctantly the fag effaced himself. He
would have given much to have gathered more
information about this mysterious Von Alt-
burg, the foreign chap who had been welted by
a strange enemy and about whom several wild
rumours had been started. But he had learned
something, at all events; he determined to carry
his news to the Badger and confer with that
worthy.
?Best to be by ourselves, Toby,? the School
Captain observed; ?this appears to be rather
important.?


They discussed the contents of Mr. Wen-
ham?s letter at length. The outstanding fact
that assailed them was that two Karls evi-
dently existed. Allison, the Record ?special,?
testified to one being even then cruising on the
Mediterranean, while the other Karl was un-
doubtedly here at Compton Prior. Unless?
Unless this Karl, their friend, was an impos-
tor, a humbug! If that were so, then Mr.
Campion was in the secret and was an impos-
tor, too. The thing seemed incredible. But
their chum, they remembered, had spoken of
another Karl, his cousin. So there were two
of that name, both Altburgs. What on earth
did it all mean ?
Lorrimer looked at Wenham with a puzzled
expression on his dark, handsome face, and
Toby, with wrinkled brows, stared back.
?Blowed if I can make head or tail of it,"
said the latter, breaking the silence. ?What
about Campion?shall we ask him ? Shall I
show him the guv ? nor?s letter ??
The Captain reflected a few moments.
?No,? he said at last. ? I don?t think I
should. You recollect what he said, Toby, the
other day in your study ? He told us not to
seek to know any more yet. I vote we leave
things as they are. Campion, or Karl, will
tell us all in good time. And be jolly sure,
Toby, the dear old chap hasn?t gone wrong,
whatever trouble he?s in. I?ll go bail for that
and so will you. Do you remember that talk
we had on the river, coming back from Mother


Potter?s? Karl?s the sort of chap who would
do something for his country. Yes, Prince or
no Prince, he?s as true as a die. We?re going
to stand by him, you and I, Toby!?
And Toby Wenham?s cheery grin and grip of
the hand was as good a response as he could
have made.
CHAPTER VII.
Karlists and a Ghost Hunt.
There was no little commotion in one corner
of the Junior Common Room one evening a lit-
tle later between tea and Preparation. ?The
Den,? as it was popularly designated by the
Seniors, generally lived up to its name in
respect to noise and disorder, but this evening
there were signs of unusual activity. At the far
end of the room, by the fireplace, the Badger
had gathered his little body of adherents to-
gether to listen to Belton?s startling tale. The
School Captain?s fag realised his importance
and made the most of the news he had over-
heard. That he should embroider it somewhat
was perhaps only to be expected. Imagination
had to supply such details as were missing in
fact.
The outcome was that the members of the
erstwhile Secret Society, the Tong, gathered
that von Altburg, the alleged Hun, or
Jaguar? of the Badger?s inventive brain, was


a Prince who had committed a fearful crime
in his own State and had had to flee for his
life. The Bolshies were after him because he?d
killed one of their chiefs. It was a Bolshy,
in fact, who had nearly done him in the other
day. To cover his tracks he had paid another
chap to dress up like him and go on a sea
voyage ?and so on. Belton filled in the picture
as he went on, and the convincing, circumstan-
tial manner in which he related the story left
little doubt as to its veracity in the minds of
his hearers.
The ex-Members of the Tong were visibly
impressed. They absorbed the news with open
mouths and wide eyes; then they looked to their
leader for guidance.
The Badger rose to the occasion, as always.
?I?ve made up my mind,?' he declared em-
phatically ??Young Carter, you barge off,
d?you hear? You aren?t in this.? The Cam-
pion junior thus addressed edged away from
the group.
?Keep your hair on,? he answered perkily.
?Seein? ghosts again, Badger??
The ex-President of the Tong silenced the in-
terrupter with a well-aimed book, and returned
his attention to the meeting.
?I?ve made up my mind,? he repeated.
?Von Altburg?s a good enough chap for me.
See how he walloped the Bounder for bullying
me. And none of us Juniors has anything
against him, except those who toady to Shotter
and Mabberley and that gang. He is in some


trouble, isn't he? In danger? Well, I?m
going to stick to him! What was it someone
said at that pow-wow down in the cellars ?
D?you remember? Karilst! Well, I?m going
to be a Karlist ?see??
?Good egg!? This from Pauncefote, the
dandy of the Lower School, immaculate in
clean collar and neat tie. ?Raise the banner,
Badger, and the clan?ll follow.?
?All jolly well,? put in another supporter,
? ?but follow where ? ? ?
?That,? said the Badger darkly, ?remains
to be seen. Karl ?our Prince Karl ??
?Who?ll do him right now?? quoted the
Microbe, his youthful poetic soul fired by the
situation.
? ?is in peril of his life,? proceeded the
Badger. ?What he wants is a bodyguard
We of the Tong will provide him with one.
And if we can track down the swine who are
trying to out him, we'll be ?we?ll be jolly well
heroes, I reckon!?
Already the Badger saw himself receiving
a deputation of the nobles of Altburg, present-
ing to him the freedom of the City (or was it
State?) together with a hefty purse of gold.
Terence O'Donell. who had just been fagging
for Montgomery, his house prefect, had joined
the gathering in time enough to pick up this
final speech of his chief. In another minute
or two he was in possession of the main facts.


?All good enough,? said he, shaking his
shaggy red head, but his practical mind sug-
gested obvious drawbacks. ?Phwat about the
Bolshy chaps?? he asked. ?Aren?t they
loikely to be ar-r-med ?pistols and knoives and
all that, you know? Oi?ve read about these
blessed long-haired divils, with their bombs
and things ?? The meeting gave a gasp ?
?and we may be boiting off more than we can
chew.?
?I don?t care,? said the Badger stoutly.
?I?m for Karl. We want another Secret
Society, don?t we ? Well, here it is : let?s get
to work and draw up the rules.?
The Badger?s enthusiasm imparted itself to
his followers. The few waverers were speedily
talked over. It was decided there and then
that the ?Band of the Karlists? be formed,
and the first meeting was announced for the
following Wednesday afternoon.
"In the cellars?? queried a wag. The sug-
gestion was tacitly ignored. ?We?ll meet here
again,? announced the Badger; ?there?s no
need yet for a password. We?ll just elect
officers?a Captain of the Guard, a lieutenant,
and so on. You fellows keep mum about it
now, or some of the others will be butting in
and spoiling the fun.?
The bell ringing at this moment put a sum-
mary end to the proceedings, and the Common
Room emptied itself.
This new rule of things did not escape the
notice of certain members of the Lower School


excluded from the activities of the Tong party;
from envy they had turned to malice. The
Pottlewell, for instance, who had
suffered dismissal from the circle, had nosed
out by his own methods the formation of a new
Society. He now began to formulate plans for
its discomfiture. With his allies Merrick and
Johnson, fellow Third-Formers, he resolved
to watch closely the movements of the self-
styled Karlists. " It was in his mind that an op-
position band ?the ?Reds? by name, perhaps
?might be brought into being as a
means of providing some recreation and ex-
citement for the present term. He resolved
to sound his chums on the matter, and pon-
dered the advisability of securing the support
of Mabberley and Shotter. The two, avowed
enemies of the Altburg chap, might be disposed
to take a hand.
Pottlewell turned the scheme over in his
mind all one evening, to the detriment of his
Latin and history work. And the more he
thought and made notes the more feasible did
the plan become.
In the meantime, Mabberley and his coL
league, the former still smarting under the
humiliation he had suffered at the hands of
Karl?his prestige in the school had been low-
ered considerably?were ripe for Pottlewell?s
plucking. An added injury in the eyes of both
was the notable defection of Cop wick. The
Australian, who had been raised to the dignity
of a prefect, had become a reformed character.


After a talk with Lorrimer, prior to his nom-
ination for the honour. Cop wick?a sensible
fellow at heart ?had made up his mind to quit
the ?push,? as he termed the Shotter ?Mab-
berley clique, and run a straight course. As a
result, he quietly gave his old associates the
cold shoulder, and, taking his new duties seri-
ously, settled down to become a really useful
member of the Kirke house team.
A fortnight passed rapidly by, a fortnight
of no event except for the first of the inter-
house cricket matches played between the Cam-
pion and Gideon teams. To their great sur-
prise, and that of the school generally, Cam-
pion's won by a respectable margin. In the
trial matches there was no little interest, for
the annual match between Compton Prior and
the big Grammar School at Dymchester?the
cathedral city ten miles distant?was immi-
nent. Montgomery, Captain of cricket, bent
himself seriously to the task of selecting the
best material at his command. With Lorrimer
to aid him, for the School Captain was a keen
cricketer, he found an eleven which promised
to give a good account of itself against the
Dymchester men. On the river there had been
minor races which provided a passing interest
for those immediately concerned and their sup-
porters, and yielded another page of sporting
news for the forthcoming issue of the ?Prior.?
Before the end of this same fortnight, Karl
von Altburg made his re-appearance in the
school. A very white-faced Karl, shaky on his


leers and listless, but making strong efforts to
respond to the kindly attentions shown him.
To celebrate his recovery Lorrimer gave a tea-
party in his study, to which AVenham, Mont-
gomery, Parkyn, Copwick, and Richardson
were invited. It was a merry evening and Karl
could not but appreciate the real spirit of good
fellowship that was present. No questions
were asked concerning the mystery of his brutal
assault, indeed, no reference to the matter was
made. The talk ran on varied subjects, inside
and outside the school, and Belton, who assisted
in the initial proceedings and who re-appeared
at intervals with unusual officiousness, gleaned
nothing for the edification of the Karlists.
In the newly-formed Society it must be con-
fessed that the past two weeks had gone tamely.
Nothing had happened to justify their exis-
tence. A veil of secrecy seemed to have been
drawn over the whole affair ??the Mystery of
the Bournewick Road,'? Pauncefote, the
romantic styled it. No news trickled through
to the school as to the activities of the police
or any others. The Badger (unanimously
elected Chief) and his followers felt a sense of
injustice; it was not fair to their high-minded
ideals that the course of life should progress so
smoothly.
On leaving the Sanatorium and taking his
place again in school life, Karl was conscious
at least of one development. Never before had
he believed himself to be so popular with the
Junior School. He went nowhere now within


its precincts without being followed by knots of
small boys who gazed upon him with admira-
tion or awe or curiosity?he was doubtful as to
the precise nature of the regard. These atten-
tions, indeed, became embarrassing at times,
and there was great danger that the good in-
tentions of the Karlist Band would be mis-
construed.
For lack of diversion, several of the Karlists,
on those afternoons when they were allowed
out of the school bounds, set themselves to keep-
ing observations upon the movements of the
man Franz. Here was an object of suspicion.
A foreigner, presumably a German or a Bol-
shy, taciturn, mysterious, resident in the vil-
lage for no known reason, prone to solitary
walks and furtive peeps over hedges. A few of
the ardent spirits in the Band determined that
this singular and sinister individual was an
enemy. No one among them as yet knew of his
connection with the Altburgian.
As a consequence, the faithful Franz became
the object of a relentless persecution. Small
boys, blissfully unconscious of their promi-
nence, dogged his footsteps wherever he went,
reporting meticulously as to his doings
throughout the period of observation. In vain
he turned to protest. His few words of broken
English were unavailing; the torrent of native
language that followed left the Junior sleuth-
hounds unmoved.
On one occasion, when the Karlists disturbed
him in a peaceful sleep in the shade of a haw-


thorn far up the rivulet, the goaded man flew
into a passion. He gesticulated, stamped his
feet and shouted guttural imprecations at his
persecutors. Then, illadvisedly, he flung a clod
of earth at them. The missile happened to hit
the fiery O?Donell. The Irishman retaliated
in similar manner, and before a combined
attack, the heavy artillery of which was too
much for the frantic man, Franz fled precipi-
tately.
But eren this baiting began to pall in time.
The Karlists in general grew restive. ?What
have we got to do, after all?? they asked of
their chief, as day after day of restless inac-
tivity passed by. ?It was a sight better fun
being in the Tong,? they protested; ?we did
do some ragging then !?
Recognising the necessity for providing his
followers with some outlet for their energies,
the Badge? set his wits to work. Just when he
was getting desperate an idea was suggested
to him no other a personage than the
Microbe. The Lower School laureate had re-
ceived back his poems with a courteous but firm
refusal of acceptance from the Editor of the
?Prior.? Te lamented loudly in the Den the
lack of appnciation which his efforts had met
with, partiedarly as in one respect the subject
was so tophal and engrossing. He read a
stanza or tw� from his Ghost Monk Ode, a
recital to wlich the juniors listened without
comment and without interest. To the Bad-
ger, however, it gave an inspiration. The


Ghost Monk?the Cellars? Why not a big
Ghost Hunt? Here was a ploy that would
appeal to his followers and make diversion for
a night.
He put the plan to Belton, to O?Donell and
to the Microbe. They hailed the idea with
gusto. A preliminary meeting was held, and
it was resolved ( nem. con.) to instruct the Karl-
ists of the great scheme afoot. The Ghost Hunt
was decreed to take place on the night of the
following Saturday, when Prep, would be over
by eight o'clock.
It suggested itself to Pottlewell, he of the fer-
ret face and cunning mind, that here was pre-
sented an opportunity for another jepe. On
reflection, however, he decided, like a true
artist, not to spoil an effect by overdoing it.
The mystery of the last ghostly marifestation
was still unsolved; its success had beer too great
to allow of the bubble being pricked suddenly.
Let the psychic research party go forward,
therefore, with their work; he could look on
with the eye of him who held the naster-key.
So, on the fateful Saturday, af er a stren-
uous afternoon in the cricket field and a less
strenuous hour in Big School, sone fifteen of
the Karlist adherents mustered at the ap-
pointed meeting-place??fail rot at your
peril!? ran the summons ?under he leadership
of the Badger. Thence, very (onspicuously,
they made their way to the cella?S. The Bad-
ger, Belton, and two others were provided with
candles, for the intention of tin party was to


explore thoroughly the recesses in the hope of
finding some secret door, some hole in the wall,
a priest?s hiding-place, perhaps, such as they
had read about in historical romances. The
tradition was that the old Prior had been
foully murdered in this very place, having been
dragged from his concealment by the myrmi-
dons of King Henry.
It was all jolly exciting, though the majority
of the psychic research party devoutly prayed
that the old Monk himself would not resent
this prying into his secrets and reveal himself
again to them. ?Vex not my troubled soul!"
he had proclaimed at that memorable gathering
some weeks before. Were they too rash now in
forcing themselves once more into his own par-
ticular haunts ?
Separating into three parties, the Karlists
wandered from cellar to cellar, examining the
stone paved floors with the greatest care. They
tapped and stamped here and there, prizing
up a loose stone where possible, and hammering
at the walls in the hope of discovering a hidden
room behind. The place smelt damp and foul;
the eloomy atmosphere illumined by the flicker-
ing candle-light gave an eerie effect to the pro-
ceedings; but nothing occurred to startle them
save the occasional scampering of a rat across
the floor.
The chronicler is reluctant to record such an
unsatisfactory conclusion to the Ghost Hunt.
An expedition of this nature certainly deserved
better result. There should have been weird


noises, clanking of chains, groans, and the like.
But the truth must be told: there was nothing
ghostly or uncanny in the whole business.
About twenty minutes of this investigation
satisfied the members of the party.
?Don?t seem anything doing,? said Belton
dolefully. ?These old brick walls are as hard
as nails and I don?t see any sign of a hiding-
place.?
?Vote we chuck it,? proposed another, to
whom a rat was a special bete noir.
?I?ve had enough of it,? said a third; ?let?s
go back to the Common Room and have a game
of something. Come on, Badger, it?s time we
turned it up.?
But the Badger, in the farther cellar, was
oblivious to the calls on his name. At that
moment, with the Microbe, candle-bearer, by
his side, he was peering about for something
white that had caught his eye in a corner of the
vault.
?What is it, Mike?? he muttered. ?Here,
bring the light down. There?s something there,
I tell you; I saw it moving just now.?
The Microbe lowered the candle obediently,
and the Badger, stooping, clutched suddenly
at a piece of paper that fluttered gently in the
draught. He picked it up, straightened him-
self, and examined the prize in the dim light.
?Hullo!? he exclaimed, ?here?s a rummy
go. It?s something to do with Harper.
Listen, Mike.
I 0 U �3 ?something. E. R. Shotter,


he read. ?And across it is ; ?Received March
14th. Boatrace Day. R. Harp ?.
The Badger re-read the statement to make
sure, for the paper was very torn and dirty;
evidently a rat had nibbled pieces from it.
?That?s old Harper?s signature,? he de-
clared. ?R. Harp-Harper, of course. Won-
der how it came here? Better keep it, I sup-
pose. Shotter may have lost it and be glad to
have it back.?
He stuffed the paper into his pocket and
gave a last look round the cellar. ?Don?t seem
anything doing, after all,? he muttered in a
disappointed tone. ?I could almost wish the
old Monk chap had given us another scare just
to make things hum. Hello! What?ve you
found. Mike??
The candle-bearer to the Karlist chief had
moved a little way off and was looking at some-
thing in or on the wall before him. The Bad-
ger stepped across to his companion?s side.
?Funny old pipe here, Badger,? he re-
marked. ?See? It seems to lead through to
the other cellar. I bent down just now and
could hear chaps? voices on the other side. I
wonder how that came there and what it was
used for??
The Badger stood silent and thoughtful.
His astute mind worked rapidly. ?Yes,? he
said, as he recalled the incidents of the previous
visit to the vaults, especially the booming voice
that had come apparently from the void. ?Yes
?I wonder.?


If the Microbe had seen his chief?s face at
that moment he would have wondered too,
would have wondered at the grin that slowly
spread upon the other?s features.
?Jolly clever jape,? said the Badger to him-
self. ?Jolly clever! Wonder I never tumbled
to it before !? ?
Then he pulled himself together, saying,
?Come on, Mike, let?s clear out. The fellows are
moving off, and I?ve had enough of it myself.
It?s been a rotten failure as a ghost hunt, and
we?ve nothing to show for it.?
As they went out to regain the purer air
above, the Badger forgot all about the scrap of
dirty paper reposing in his pocket?forgot all
about the names scribbled thereon. He little
thought in the joy of the discovery of the pipe
between the two cellars that he had unwit-
tingly stumbled upon a link in the chain of
evidence connected with another and greater
mystery. Later events were to prove to him the
importance of this apparently insignificant find.
CHAPTER VIII.
Westham Fair.
It was at this time of the year that the fair
at Westham, a neighbouring village, was held.
To the boys at Compton Prior, far more than to
any local residents, this annual festival was an


event of no little importance. It meant a half
holiday and several hours of wild amusement.
As a rule, in addition to swings and round-
abouts, a circus and a brass band, there were
side shows in variety. As a cattle and horse
fair it enjoyed great repute in the country and
offered much to see and admire, but the recrea-
tion side of the day provided the chief allure-
ment.
On the Tuesday, then, when the fair opened,
the school as a whole looked forward eagerly
to mid-day. Dinner over, parties were made
up for the two-mile walk to Westham. To
Karl, who had never seen an English country
fair, the experience promised to be a novel one.
Lorrimer and Wenham took him in their
charge, the latter enlarging during the walk on
fairs in general and the special attractions that
this particular one offered.
Among the Lower School boys who mingled
with the merry-makers that afternoon were
Pottlewell, Merrick and Johnson, three in-
separables when any fun or mischief was afoot.
They did the fair thoroughly, spending all their
available cash on the delights which it offered.
But even amusement palls in time, and Pottle-
well?s active brain sought for fresh excitement.
He appealed to his two intimates in vain;
neither could offer a suggestion.
?Let?s have a rag,? said Pottlewell. ?I?m
not going home yet. We?ve spent every blessed
penny we?ve got and seen about all there is
going.?


Merrick and Johnson agreed, but their
imaginations refused to rise to the occasion.
Looking round him, Pottlewell had an in-
spiration. Close by was a tent wherein one,
?Madame Zeo,? from Egypt, announced that
fortunes could be told, or palmistry or the turn
of the cards, for a small consideration. The
volatile Third-Former read the placard with in-
creasing interest. Then he bade his companions
wait for him for a minute and disappeared into
the tent.
?Silly ass!? Merrick ejaculated. ?Hasn?t
got a penny, and I?ll bet the old woman won?t
give him tick. What?s he after??
What Pottlewell was after was soon made ap-
parent on his reappearance. He explained to
the two that Madame Zeo ??quite a decent old
bird, and not really an Egyptian??had con-
fessed that business was very slack. He had
put it to her that this could be remedied if she
would take him as a temporary assistant.
There was a way by which trade could be
speeded up. Was she willing? Madame Zeo,
it seemed, had been won over to the scheme.
?You chaps have got to stand in and help.?
Pottlewell?s face fairly beamed at the prospect
of a new jape. ?I?m going to rig myself up in
the old bird?s things and read fortunes. You
two run round and beat up some recruits; Up-
per or Lower School, it doesn?t matter, I?ll deal
with ?em. And the things I?ll tell ?em will sur-
prise the chaps, I promise you. The old girl?s


going to give me a share of the swag, so hurry
up and fetch some clients ! ? 5
That Merrick and Johnson were ?on? goes
without saying. While Pottlewell dived into
the soothsayer?s tent to prepare for the per-
formances, they set off through the fair on their
mission. It was not easy at first to secure the
required clients, but two juniors having been
roped in and their startling testimony as to the
result having been well circulated, business at
the fortune-teller?s certainly did begin to look
up. In a little time PottlewelTs aids had quite
half a dozen prospective clients waiting their
turn at the tent door.
Pottlewell?s methods may be gathered from
the following dialogue which ensued on Paunce-
fote, of the Upper Second, being ushered shyly
into the sanctum.
?Your handl? said the hooded figure at the
table, in a hoarse whisper.
Pauncefote extended an open palm which
bore every indication of having served its owner
well during the afternoon.
?What do I read here?? asked ?Madame.?
?Faint are the lines?there is much that ob-
scures them"?(Pauncefote, conscious of the
grime which he had accumulated, blushed
furiously)??but those I see are pregnant with
meaning.? The seer bent closer to the junior?s
hand. ? I see ambition?courage?faithful-
ness. Now there crosses the path a line of
danger. Beware, young man, of unseen
enemies. I see a Secret Society?it has you in


its toils. Beware again ! There is a keen-faced
youth?man, I mean ?his hair is bristly and
rough, his name is that of an animal ?a fierce
animal, and he will?cross my path with silver,
gorgio, and I will speak more!?
Pauncefote, his curiosity aroused, fished out
a sixpence from his pocket and dropped it on
the table. What on earth was the Badger going
to do to him? he wondered. For the witch?s
allusion was only too clear to his mind.
?The keen-faced youth?he will bring you
harm ! Shun him. Flee while there is yet time.
Spoil not your glorious career. I dare say
no more !? concluded the seer darkly.
To the candidates for enlightenment who
succeeded the impressed junior, ?Madam Zeo?
made revelations which betrayed a peculiarly
intimate knowledge of their affairs. The news
began to spread through the fair that there
was a wonder-worker in the fortune-telling
booth who was a ?corker.? One after another,
the boys wandered up to listen to the testimony
of those who had passed within the portals and
to follow thither in their turn. To the delight of
the real sorceress, who kept herself well in the
background, money literally poured in. Never
had Westham Fair yielded her so rich a har-
vest, and Pottlewell?s eyes glistened as he cal-
culated his share of the ?swag.?
There came, among the curious, O?Donell
of the fiery locks.
Pottlewell had more than one score against
this worthy.


?The Fates tell me dark things, 0 Scot ??
he began.
?Scot, is it?? O?Donell?s face flamed to the
hue of his hair. ?And it?s little you know of
me ! I'm Oirish, I am! Oirish 1? ?
Pottlewell kept his head bent low over the
other?s broad, flat hand. ?Timidity, inde-
cision?these mark thy character. But thou
art young. Thy mind is unformed. Fear
not those above thee who rule thy actions ??
?Fear!? O?Donell snorted. ?Oh, I?ll fear
thim!?
?The line of life is troubled?broken. Dis-
aster and disaster will follow thee. 0 Scotch-
man ?unless ?unless ?? the soothsayer heaved
a deep sigh???unless thou atonest for a sin.
I see here the sign of a Pot?ay, and of a Well.
Thou knowest what they signify! Is there not
retribution to be made of something thou got-
test ?gottest ? the low hoarse voice hesi-
tated over the word ??something thou didst
got by fraud?? Here was another deep sigh
as the reading ended.
Outside O?Donell relieved his mind. ?The
lies she told me!? he exclaimed. ?And called
me Scotchman, she did! The old owl! And
as much as told me I ought to return young
Pottlewell the fountain pen I swapped him for.
Well, that?s sixpence chucked away for noth-
ing!;?
His attempt to secure a refund of threepence
on learning of the standard fee demanded, led
to a disturbance with Merrick that was only


checked by the arrival of another and more im-
portant client.
The door-keeper brushed O?Donell aside im-
patiently and hastened in to make a communi-
cation to the seer.
?Potty!? he whispered quickly. ?Here?s
Donaldson come up for a reading! What shall
we do??
Pottlewell, though he had never read of the
famous pronouncement, ?Paudace, toujours
I?audace!? acted upon it without delay. Had
he reflected he might have been lost.
?Bring the beggar in.? he murmured. ?I?ve
one or two things to get back!?
The junior school master was accordingly
ushered into the tent, to gravely take his seat at
the table.
?The cards ?or the hand?? asked the hoarse
voice, very low this time for safety.
To Pottlewell?s relief the master plumped for
?the hand? and extended his right for in-
spection.
The Third-Former?s mind worked rapidly.
He decided how far he should go, while appar-
ently engaged in studying the network of lines.
?A long life I see,? he remarked, tracing a
curved line with his finger, ?a long life and an
honoured one.?
?Pardon me, that is the line of fate,? the
master observed. ?The life line runs alone-
here.?
Pottlewell swallowed something and moved
the position of his finger quickly. Then he pro-


ceeded in a low tone, making no apology for
his lapse.
?You have authority?great authority ?
many wait on your bidding and obey your com-
mands. You" are a leader of boys ?I mean
men,? he added hurriedly. ?See that you use
your power justly. I see one ?the lines tell me
?I see one, a sensitive, shrinking soul ?his
name begins with a ?yes, with a P?who
respects you, even loves you. Be merciful to him,
temper justice with kindness. It will reward
you.? Pottlewell shifted to another part of the
listener?s hand. ?Here is the line of Destiny.
Beware of a tall, fair man ??
?Why not woman?? queried the master,
hiding a smile with his other hand. ?It?s the
usual thing, you know!?
Pottlewell ignored the interruption.
? ?a tall, fair man,? he repeated. ?He has
come new into your life. He has come from
abroad, from an enemy country. There is a C
in his name, a large C ?there is the figure, too
of a camp here?but the rest is dark. Fear him,
for he is treacherous and cruel. He will work
against thee like a snake ??
?Like fiddlesticks!? exclaimed Mr. Donald-
son, rising with a laugh and throwing the fee
of threepence down upon the table. ?Good
fortune-teller, thou art indeed a witch ! The
best of luck attend thee. But thy speech be-
trayeth thee, 0 the Egyptian!? And
with this cryptic utterance he quitted the tent,
a broad smile upon his face that left Merrick


vastly puzzled as to the result of this momentous
interview.
We may leave Pottlewell to make his settle-
ment with the delighted Madame Zeo, and to
ponder over the somewhat disturbing remark
made by the master, while we shift our attention
to another quarter of the fair.
After amusing themselves pretty thoroughly
at the various shows and booths, Karl and his
friends had betaken themselves to that part
where horses and other animals offered for sale
were being paraded. They were nearing the
roped-in enclosure where some ponies were
being put through their paces when a commo-
tion aroused their attention. Going across to
the scene of the excitement they beheld Morris,
the sturdy Gideonite who had taken part in
the famous rowing contest, crying bitterly from
o */ o �/
a smack across the head dealt him by one of the
ring men. By his side was the Badger, vali-
antly protesting against this outrage.
?Yah! You great brute!? yelled the Kirke-
ite. ?Hit someone bigger next time, will
you!?
Lorrimer interposed with a quick question.
The Badger explained what had happened.
MorrG h�>d evinced a desire to ride one of the
jolly-looking little ponies that were scampering
about, and was actually scrambling on to the
back of one when the man ran across the en-
closure and knocked him off his steed.
?Caught him a real welt, didn?t he ! Wonder


you didn?t hear it!? The Badger appealed to
the other juniors now gathered. ?The brute !?
The man concerned, a swarthy thick-set
gypsy, glared at the group sullenly and mut-
tered something. The words were unintelligi-
ble to all but Karl, who understood the Czech
imprecation.
Answering in the same tongue, he interro-
gated the man, who complained that the boys
had been teasing the ponies and that he had
only interfered when it was necessary. He had
not meant to be rough; the young gentleman
was not so hurt as he made out. He had only
used the flat of his hand.
Karl satisfied himself that it was ?six of one
and half a dozen of the other? and, telling
Morris not to make a fool of himself by howl-
ing any longer, moved away again with his
companions.
As he turned, however, the man, who had
been observing him curiously, came forward and
touched him on the shoulder. He spoke again
in Czech, dropping his tone. Whatever he said,
it only made the boy shrug his shoulders and say
something curtly in reply. Lorrimer watched
this exchange of words with interest. When
Karl joined him he put the question.
?What did that beggar want with you??
Karl laughed. ?It seems he comes from near
my part of the world,? he said. ?I?ve never
seen him before, so far as I know, but he?
as you say?spotted me. Funny, isn?t it??


?He?s not a bright-looking specimen, Karl.
I call him an ugly customer; kind of chap one
wouldn?t care to meet alone in a dark lane at
night, eh??
The other laughed again. ?They?re not all
as black as they?re painted, Paul, these Balkan
gypsy folk. No, this chap was friendly enough.
He wanted to give me a warning, he said.?
?A warning ?? Lorrimer?s eyes lighted up
and his face grew serious. ??What about ? ??
?Oh, I don?t know.? Karl shrugged his
shoulders in that expressive manner of his.
?He said nothing except that I should keep my
eyes open ?that I had enemies about. As if I
didn?t know that 1 Why, that fortune-teller that
the kids are talking about could have said the
same thing. Perhaps the fellow expected me to
let him tell my fortune! ? ?
But Lorrimer was not disposed to laugh at
the incident so readily. There had been some-
thing sinister about the fellow, and this sudden
word of warning to Karl might portend danger.
He walked on in silence, turning the matter
over in his mind.
Not so Wenham. Out to enjoy himself, Toby
had already stopped at a booth where one was
invited to throw rope rings on to various arti-
cles laid out in tiers ?cheap clocks, earthen-
ware cups, mugs, toys, etc. Morris, the Bad-
ger, and other juniors were in attendance, cheer-
ing at the ?Prior? editor?s efforts.
This diversion made Karl forget for the
time the unpleasant encounter at the horse-


ring, and he carried Lorrimer off with him to
join in the game.
And so, passing from one amusement to
another on their way back, he spent the rest of
the holiday in care-free content, heedless of the
fact that the hand which had once struck at
him with murderous intent had now been ex-
tended to him in well-meant friendliness.
CHAPTER IX.
Two Letters.
The I 0 U so strangely found in the cellars
on the night of the great ghost hunt lay for-
gotten in the Badger?s pocKet for some days,
owing principally to the fact that a good deal
of his leisure time was occupied with imposi-
tions. ??That beast Donaldson?-? had dropped
upon him for inattention in class and woeful
ignorance of his mathematics. In a secluded
corner of the Den he laboured assiduously to
reduce the magnitude of his task.
The matter of the paper, however, occurred
suddenly to his mind one morning when, after
tidying up his master?s study (he was fag to
Parkvn of his own house), he shot violently
out of the room into the corridor and cannoned


abruptly against Shotter. The latter was
hurrying off to cricket practice at the nets and
was laden with bat and pads.
?You infernal young nuisance!? exclaimed
the senior, dropping the bat heavily on one foot.
?What the dickens d?you mean shooting out
like that 1 Get out of the way, will you ??
He caught the Badger a stinging smack on
the head that sent the junior staggering
against the wall. A flying kick made the hap-
less youth give a howl of rage and pain. Then
Shotter picked up the bat and strode off down
the passage, regardless of the malignant look
bestowed upon him by the fag.
?Filthy beast!? ejaculated the Badger.
?Til keep his rotten old I 0 U now! I?ll show
it round the school, I will I P?raps he?d like
everyone to know that he was owing Harper
three quid 1 The beast! ? ?
The Badger pursued his way down the stairs
and sought his locker in the Big Hall. He, too,
was due for cricket. He paused in the act of
getting out his shoes to produce the paper from
his pocket. On the back of it he saw jotted
down a memorandum that he had made relative
to a new rule to be proposed for the Band of


Karlists, and resolved to put it in safe keeping
for the present. He pushed the paper, there-
fore, in the back of the locker, banged the door
to, and scampered off.
Shotter, meanwhile, his temper ruffled, put
in an unhappy hour at the nets. Nothing went
right for him. Although deemed a fair bat, he
was bowled over and over again by simple
balls. His cutting and driving went to pieces,
and his chances for qualifying for even a Second
Eleven match seemed to be nil.
The senior would have been more troubled in
his mind, however, could he have peeped at that
moment into Copwick?s study?or, rather, that
which the Australian shared with another
Kirkeite, Middleton by name. Had he been
gifted with this vision he would have seen his
former ally sprawled in a lounge chair, with
his feet on the table, while he perused the fol-
lowing letter received that morning.
? Dear Coppy,
? How are things going at the old shop ?
I haven?t heard any school news for a long time
it seems years; and I shall be glad to have a line
from you. Am I remembered still ? Does the


name Harper awaken a thrill yet ? I flatter my r self
that I made things hum a bit in my sojourn at the
school, and I am vain enough to hope that my
fame (or is it ill-fame ?) has not died out. What
ripping times we used to have you and I, and
Shorter and the Bounder ! Do you remember how
we smoked out old Septimus one evening, and how
ratty the old reverend gentleman got ? And that
billiard tournament down at the Priory Inn, where
you and I cleared the board (how much did we win
that time ?), and old Mabberley tried to drink beer
and catted on the way back. I?m in Dymchester
now, in a bank; forty bob a week to begin with,
and no end of exams, to pass before I get a really
decent berth. You must come over to see me one
day?get special leave, will yo� ? and we 11 ha\ e
an evening out. There?s a topping Empire here,
change of programme every' week, and the best
people down from London. Give my best regards
to old Atterbury; tell him I realise now how much
time I wasted in school and how hard I m trying
to make up for lost time. One never appreciates,
until one has left school, how much one owes to
it. (Lot of ? ones ? there, I?m afraid I) I wonder
if he?d believe that tosh if you did tell him it ?
No more than you do, I expect. Well, cheerio,
old son, I?m not much of a hand at letter-writing.
I?d rather knock off a hundred with a cue than do
much quill-driving. By the way, how are the
heavenly twins ?dear old Ted and the Bounder ?
Give ?em my love. Tell Shotter I miss his bets
frightfully. He was a regular income to me. He
only had one real bit of luck, over that boat-race


for the Bradham, when he went double or quits on
three pounds fifteen. I ought to have known Ted
better : he was betting on an absolute cert. I
didn?t know it at the time, but I?ve grown wiser.
Poor old Kirke?s, and it was their race from the
start, wasn?t it ! Ask Shotter what he knows
about oars; that?s all, just oars. He?ll understand.
I?ve got a bone to pick with him when we meet ?
and I hope that?ll be soon. Love to the Bounder.
Is he as flabby as ever ? Oh, by the way, kick
that young beggar, Badgerley, for me, will you ?
My old fag, you know. I wonder whose study
he?s got to mess up this term. Well, cheerio
again, old son. Quite a long letter after all, isn?t
it, and not much news. Let?s hear from you.
Dymchester calling?hello, Australia ?
Yours ever,
R. Harper.?
Yes, quite a long letter for Dick Harper.
Not much news? Copwick hummed a popular
air quietly as he scanned the hastily penned
scrawl again. Some news about Shotter, cer-
tainly. What did the chap mean ? What was
all that gaff about the boat-race, and oars?
Why oars'! The incident of the Gideonite boat
mishap, of the broken oar, rose before the Aus-
tralian?s mental gaze. He recalled what had


happened; recalled, too, the little group in the
boat-shed when Burton and the Reverend Sep-
timus had personally inspected the damaged
scull. What did Shotter have to do with that?
What did he know about that broken oar?
The questions dinned themselves into Cop-
wick?s ears, and he found himself grievously
troubled by their insistence. Dymchester? It
might be worth his while doing what old Harper
suggested and running over to the city to have
a yap with him. It all sounded jolly unpleas-
ant,. Kirke?s house had suffered under the
shadow of suspicion for too long a time. If
there had been dirty work, as Harper?s letter
rather intimated ?as Burton and Gideon had
themselves suggested ?well, it was anyone?s
duty to clear things up if it Were possible. As
to Shotter?he felt no compunction in that
direction. He had done with the chap; done
with him and Mabberley. Ted Shotter was a
mean-souled fellow at the best; he never had any
real liking for him in those days when they were
always in mischief together. Yes, he thought
he would go along to Dymchester some time
and hear further what Harper had to say about
the matter.


Copwick was still sitting in the same attitude
when Karl von Altburg burst into the study.
The latter was in flannels, for he was now fit
enough to take a hand in games again. As a
matter of fact, he had just played a couple
of sets with Lorrimer on the tennis court.
The Australian looked up at his visitor and
let his feet down to the floor.
?Hello, friend Karl,? he said, ?what a differ-
ent chap you?re looking. You?re tons better,
aren?t you? Good healthy colour and all
that.?
?Rather,? responded the other. ?Just had
a knock up against Paul. Mr. Campion came
to watch us. I lost both sets, but he said I?d
improved wonderfully. Told me I?d be good
enough soon to enter for the Tennis Prize.?
?Good manl? Copwick regarded Karl with
a pleasant smile on his good-natured face. For
some time since his elevation to the rank of
prefect he had seen a good deal of the Alt-
burgian and, like Lorrimer and Wenham, he
found himself drawn more and more towards
him.
?Where?s Wenham?? asked Karl suddenly.
?I haven?t seen him all the morning. Let?s go


and dig him out. He?s working, I dare say
?swotting,? isn?t it??
?Right you are,? replied Copwick, putting
all unpleasant thoughts out of his head for the
time. ?Toby won?t thank us, perhaps, but
we?ll chance that. Come along. ? ?
In his own study, which was in the same
Schoolhouse corridor as that of Lorrimer,
Toby Wenham sat with a pre-occupied air.
He, too, had received a letter that morning, a
letter that had given him food for serious
thought. It was from his father and ran as
follows: ?
? My Dear Boy,
? I find I have not written to you for a
week, so am snatching a few minutes now to rectify
the omission.? ?(Here followed certain domestic
details and questions relating to Toby?s work at
school with which we need not concern ourselves.
The more important portion of the letter had
reference to the mystery of Karl von Altburg and
the photograph that Toby had forwarded some time
back for his father?s inspection.)?? ... I want to
tell you of something that Bob Allison had dis-
covered. This is nothing less than a revolutionary
plot aimed to overthrow the present rule in Altburg.
As you will remember, we got wind long back of
something moving in this direction. Russia is


behind it, for Altburg, by its position, adjoining
Germany on one side as it does, would be a valuable
stronghold for the Bolshevik party. To put it
briefly, the plot is to kidnap the Prince?wherever
he is?and hand him over to the Petrograd people.
The mystery of it is : where has the Prince Karl
gone ? Allison will have it that he is cruising in
the Mediterranean. But there is this Von Altburg
at your school, who you say is Prince Karl himselft
I don?t know what to make of it quite. It looks
like crooked business?two Princes of the same
name?doesn?t it ? I think Allison will want to
run down to Compton Prior when he returns (he
is away at present), and make enquiries for himself.
Can he see your friend Karl, do you think ? The
rotten part about the affair is that an Altburg
Archduke?he?s called Otto?is working in with
the revolutionary party; expects to get himself
elected as First President of the Republic, I suppose.
But whether this Otto is in Russia now, or over
here, we haven?t found out. It looks like being a
good story,? as we newspaper men term it. There,
thats enough for the present. I have to tell you
tins so that you?ll be primed with the main facts
it Allison comes along to see you. All the best
Wishes, dear boy, for your success in the Maxwell
Ido hope you?ll pull it off. Mother sends her
love. By the way, let me have a copy of the
nor m good time when published. I?ll keep
that ghost story in mind that you wrote about.
?Yours affectionately,
Dad.?


Toby Wenham had read and re-read his
father?s letter when Copwick and Karl made
their appearance in the study. This was great
news, indeed; things were moving now with a
vengeance. He hoped Allison would be along
soon to see him. As to Karl-1 His usually
cheerful face took on a puzzled expression as he
pondered his chum?s name. There was the
mystery! He came back to that every time.
Was Karl?their Karl?really the Prince of
Altburg as they supposed?or was he someone
else? A jolly big puzzle it was, and it would
need LOrrimer?s brains, Allison s too in ad-
dition to his, to work out the problem.
There was no time for further consideration
of that at present, however. Here was Karl
himself, calling on Toby to come out and get
a breath of pure air before dinner.
?Come along and have a game of fives,
Toby,? he cried. tc l can?t beat Paul at tennis,
but I can beat you at the other game. Put those
old papers and books away? ?Toby?s table was
littered with text books on which he had been
working??and give your head a rest.?
Wenham sprang up, with his old smile


reasserting itself, linked his arm in that of
Karl s and the three passed out of the study.
Later on in the day Toby found an opportu-
nity to have a word with Lorrimer alone. The
School C aptain was closeted with Montgomery
when the ?Prior? editor ran him to earth, the
two being in deep consultation over the team
selection for the Dymchester cricket match.
Toby?s advice was sought on the matter of
choice between Copwick and Francis (the new
Gideonite prefect, it will be remembered), and
he gave his casting vote in favour of the former.
The Australian?s form in recent games had
greatly improved and in all probability he would
prove a decided acquisition to the team. No
player himself, Wenham was a keen critic of
the game, and his opinion was not to be held
lightly.
The discussion ended, and Montgomery gone,
Toby put his father?s letter before his friend.
The} read it together, and Toby reiterated
the questions that were perturbing him. The
two sat together for half-an-hour, going over
the facts as they knew them, debating this point
and that, and suggesting hypotheses by way
of arming at a sane solution of the mystery.


But mystery it still remained in their minds
when Toby rose to go. If only Mr. Campion
had not been so insistent on their not question-
ing further! They were so much in the dark.
?Vestigia terrent?? old Horace had the word
for it ?the steps came towards one all the while,
terrifying ??nulla retrorsum.?? And really,
after all, the explanation might be perfectly
simple!
CHAPTER X.
Kirke?s v. Gideon?s.
It was some time later, on a Saturday at the
end of May, that the trouble which had been
brewing for a considerable while between oppos-
ing factions in the Junior School came to a
head. The first step towards this climax was a
challenge issued by the Gideonites to their Kirke
rivals to row a race on the Dibbin. The former
were still smarting under a sense of undeserved
defeat; the honour of the house was at stake.
The Kirkeites readily responded. They, too,
had suffered ?suffered ignominy and reproach,
innuendo and open attack. The old topic of


the Bradham contest was revived and the Com-
mon Eoom echoed with vituperation and denial
until the heat of the argument led to a general
fracas.
On this sunny Saturday afternoon, therefore,
the question of superiority between the two
houses was to be put to the final test. ? ?We
live in deeds, not words!? ? declaimed the
Microbe sententiously. ?Let Gideon arise and
slay us if they can!? And Gideon arose, in
full might. The juniors of the house flocked
down to the river bank to witness the prowess
of their champions, the while the supporters of
Kirke, hardly less numerous, lined up on the
other side.
The two boats, each manned by four doughty
rowers, started the race from just above the
bridge. It had been decided to row a portion
of the course laid out for the Bradham Cup
lace, the finish to take place by Melsham?s
Mill.
Down dropped the signal flag, and down to
their oars bent the rival crews.
?Gideon ! Gideon ! Lay to it, Gideon !?
"Now then, Kirke! Pull! Pull! Kirke!
Kirke!?


The air was pulsating with the shouts and
exhortations of the frenzied supporters. Run-
ning along the tow-path, the two coaches (Simp-
son of Gideon?s and Repington of Kirke?s, both
enthusiastic wet-bobs) urged on their men to
greater and still greater efforts.
In the first boat ?Gideon?s?which had
spurted ahead with good effect, were Morris,
O?Donell, Mapleton and Falconer, with little
Benham as cox. The Kirke crew comprised
Badgerley, Belton, Pauncefote (who, for all
his dandyism, could pull an oar with the best),
and Lyell. The Microbe sat in the coxswain?s
seat, fully alive to the importance of his post.
These were the pick of the junior rowing men,
for neither Schoolhouse nor Campion?s could
produce a crew to compete with either.
Pauncefote, let us note in passing, had ten-
dered his resignation from the Karlists, follow-
ing upon the warning he had received from
?Madame Zeo? at the Fair. So much for the
success of Pottlewell?s excellent mimicry. But
the Third-Former was left in no illusion as to
Mr. Donaldson?s penetration of his disguise.
In a subsequent Scripture lesson the master had
set Pottlewell to read the story of Joseph?s


interpretation of Pharaoh?s dream, and had
delivered a short discourse upon divination by
dreams that included a reference to fortune-
telling by palmistry. A good natured tweak of
the ear after class had been dismissed, and a
?Hail! 0 Potiphar!? removed the last shadow
of doubt in his mind.
From the bridge over the Dibbin Mr. Rae-
burn, the ?Stinks? master, blinked at the
scene through his spectacles, while Mr. Gilbert
Kirke and the Rev. Septimus Gideon paused
on their afternoon walk to watch their charges
with undisguised interest and amusement.
?Kirke?s Lambs,? as the members of one house
were lovingly designated, certainly did their
best to live up to the reputation of those his-
torical characters to whom the name was
originally applied. They breathed fire in their
invocations, their mien bespoke relentless
ferocity. It was a sad reflection on history that
their house master should be the very antithesis
of the notorious Colonel Kirke of King James?
time. On their side the Gideonites, conscious
of the eye of their own head, let themselves go
unrestrainedly. For the time the riverside
sounded as if Pandemonium had broken loose.


?Come on. Gideon's!" ? Lay to it, Kirke! ?
?Badger! Badger!?
?Morris I Morris!? ?Now then?all together
there 1 ? ?Pull I Pull! ? J
The cries resounded on either side, as the par-
tisans danced and ran, and waved frantic arms
to their heroes, who, red in the face and with
gasping breath, strove manfully to increase the
pace. Now the Gideon boat fell back slightly,
and the Kirke crew, urged by their coach, made
a gallant and successful attempt to reach their
opponents.
Half-way up the course the two boats were
fairly level, but when Melsham?s Mill came in
sight round the bend the Kirkeites had drawn
a quartet of a length ahead.
?Well rowed! Well rowed!? came the en-
couraging yell from the bank, and the Badger?s
tense face gleamed with fresh resolution. With
lips tight-set, though the effort cost him some-
thing, he swung his oar fiercely at bow to
quicken the pace, regardless of admonitions
from his coach, and then the terrible thing hap-
pened f To the consternation of the Kirke sup-
porters, and to his ineffable disgust, he ?the


Badger, tried and proved rowing man ! ?caught
a crab!
Over he went backwards, losing his seat and
almost losing his oar at the same time. The
frail craft swayed, swung round a little in the
current, and the Gideon boat, its occupants
pulling cleanly and steadily, forged past them
to take the lead again.
The mishap was disastrous ! The loss of those
fateful moments was not to be recovered, row
the Kirkeites ever so mightily. A little later
the leading boat passed the winning post by
Melsham s Mill and the race was over.
Gideon?s had demonstrated their superiority
on the river. The Bradham defeat had been
avenged I
If Pandemonium had broken loose before, it
is difficult to say what was now the term to be
applied to the scene that was enacted on the
banks of the peaeful Dibbin. While the
Gideonite herd shouted itself hoarse in exulta-
tion, acclaiming their champions to the skies,
the chagrined Kirkeites filled the air with their
lamentations. The Badger, hot of face, crest-
fallen, and angry with himself at his display of
oarsmanship, was the centre of a howling mob.


Even his own immediate supporters, the mem-
bers of the inner circle, the Band of Karlists,
found it difficult to condone this lapse on his
part. Explanations, recriminations and ex-
postulations passed from mouth to mouth.
Eventually the rival factions, triumphant and
dejected respectively, surged up to the school,
where the news of the great contest was eagerly
awaited by others of the two houses. And here
the battle was fought over again, until it
seemed likely that law and order would have to
be enforced by high authority.
All the rest of the afternoon and throughout
the evening the defeated Kirkeites nursed their
disappointment. The Common Room was a
Babel; the Gideonites, basking in the sunshine
of their seniors? approval, were insufferable in
their conceit; the Lambs, for once displaying
something of their namesake?s meekness, held
together in groups, like plotters concocting their
nefarious schemes.
In the course of the Preparation hour, the
Badger?s quick brain was at work. Something
had to be done to atone for his grievous dis-
aster. He had let down his house, and he was
not allowed to forget it. In the Latin exer-


cises which he studiously strove to master that
evening his eye fell upon the phrase ?frangas
non flectes.? ?You may break, but you shall
not bend me,? was the translation given in the
pocket dictionary of quotations which he con-
sulted, with the added note that this was the
motto of the Earls of Granville. The words
took his fancy, and he vowed to himself that he
would emulate their lordships? gallant spirit.
The Gideonite rabble should see that he was not
crushed; he would arise in his might, reassert
his ascendancy over his followers, and lead them
again to victory.
The daring idea that was now evolved in the
Badger?s brain was to plan a raid upon Gideon?s
house after ?lights out.? It was a matter of
common knowledge that Mr. Gilbert Kirke and
the Rev. Septimus had gone oh together to
spend the evening in Bournewick. They would
not be back until a late hour. In the Gideon
stronghold the prefect on duty would be Fran-
cis, a less difficult nut to crack than the stalwart
Montgomery, the cricket captain. In Kirke?s
they would have to deal with Copwick most
probably, but Coppy had always been a good
sport, and he might he ?squared.?


Having got his scheme well mapped out in
his mind the Badger, the hour?s ordeal over,
sought counsel with his loyal allies, Belton and
the Microbe. The suggestion of a raid upon
their foes was hailed with delight. One by one
the Kirkeite juniors were approached, and as
the news spread among them, the Lambs rallied
to the Badger?s side. For the delicate task of
clearing the ground the Badger himself was
deputed to tackle Cop wick. The Australian
did not prove adamant. He had no love for the
Gideonites and, after all, with certain provisos
upon which he insisted, a little blowing off of
steam in this way would do the youngsters no
harm. He put it to the Badger that after
?'lights out,? at 9.30 p.m. it was highly prob-
able he would be paying a visit to the School-
house on matters of state. In the interval be-
tween then and his return ?half an hour per-
haps?he would prefer to be ignorant of his
charges? doings. There was to be no smashing
things, however; no extremist measures. The
Badger solemnly passed his word to keep his
men within bounds, and departed to perfect his
plans.
Very soon after half-past nine, Cop wick


having betaken himself to Lorrimer?s study, the
marauding party in pyjamas and night-shirts,
assembled in the corridor outside the larger
dormitory, armed for the fray. It had been
stipulated that no bolsters, or pillows should be
utilised. For weapons, therefore, Kirke?s
Lambs fell back upon cricket pads, gymnasium
belts (?no buckles, mind !? insisted their chief),
bath towels tightly rolled, and ?happy thought
of the Microbe! ?several sacks scrounged from
the cellars and well packed to give substance to
them.
The two houses, as we have noted, were
joined by a stone passage. Noiselessly as
Indians on the warpath, the raiders stole across
the connecting link aijd entered the Gideonite
lair. The dormitories of the enemy were four
in number, the largest being at the end, and thus
the last to be attacked. According to plan (the
Badger had the military term pat) the Lambs
made for the nearer three rooms simultane-
ously. The concerted attack was a complete
surprise. Not a Gideonite had suspected a noc-
turnal visit from the rival house. One and all
reposed beneath the sheets, feeling secure and
giving themselves to pleasant dreams of the


great victory their house had that day achieved.
Suddenly the storm broke. Like the Assyrian
who emulated the ??wolf on the fold,? the
avenging Lambs descended upon their enemies.
Beds were overturned, their clothes rudely torn
away, and the occupants flung willy-nilly upon
the floor. Pad and belt and sack came into
play; and then, as the amazed Gideonites ral-
lied themselves, the joy of battle awoke.
It was a close hand-to-hand combat. ?Mark
your man!? was the Badger?s command to his
followers, who faithfully acted upon the Rugger
maxim. Backwards and forwards in the
stricken dormitories they raged, swinging their
improvised clubs with often deadly effect, while
the rooms resounded to the cries and gasping
breath of the combatants.
The battle surged out into the corridors, and
now from the near distance came the war-cry of
the big dormitory wherein Francis was rousing
from his half sleep to a sense of trouble. ?The
sword of the Lord and Gideon!? shouted the
advance guard, headed by the fiery Terence
O?Donell and the two rowing junior ?bloods,?
Simpson and Mapleton. ?The Sword of the
Lord and Gideon!? Never had Montgomery


dreamed, when he popularised this house
?cry,? that it would be the clarion call on such
an occasion as this.
With these reinforcements the Gideonites
took fresh heart. No proviso with regard to
the use of school property had been laid upon
them. They snatched pillows and bolsters, in
addition to other gear that came to hand, and
flung themselves headlong upon the detested
Kirkeites. Hot and furious was the battle now,
and the temper of the contesting sides rose cor-
respondingly. Like Iroquois and Sioux in their
most dread forays, they were in no mood to give
quarter. Private feuds that existed between
individual members were now put to the arbi-
trament of fisticuffs. Karlist fought Karlist,
and the bond of brotherhood for the moment
was forgotten. It was the greatest and most
glorious fight that any house at Compton Prior
had ever known.
Did the ghost of the old murdered monk,
(Brother Martin), walk that night his troubled
soul must have been sorely vexed by the tumult.
It was well indeed for raider and raided alike
that the walls of the old building were thick,
else the sound of the conflict must have pene-


trated to the other houses. But no outside in-
terruption came to disturb the opposing armies.
The battle waxed to its height, and then
waned as the superior numbers of the Gideonites
told upon their foes. Gradually the avenging
horde of Kirke?s Lambs was driven back to-
wards the passage. The hosts of Gideon saw
triumph within their grasp, but the joy of vic-
tory was not with them altogether, for though
they were now in retreat ??in good order,?
observed the Badger with satisfaction?Kirke?s
house had achieved its purpose. Behind them
were the enemy?s dormitories, three of them in
total disorder, while the personal injuries in-
flicted had been considerable.
At this juncture Francis, prefectorial author-
ity asserting itself, gathered his flock together.
?Back to your rooms, you fellows,? he com-
manded. ?That?s enough for to-night. You?ve
had all the rope I can give you. Scoot along
now and put your rooms in order. Those young
beggars have given you a bit of a towelling, but
you drove ?em off all right, Hurry up, now;
Gideon may be along any moment and you?ll be
stuffy with lines for the rest of the term. Jump
to it!?


Reluctantly but obediently the Gideonites
turned back from the pursuit, to repair the
damage to their stronghold. Meanwhile, the
Lambs, openly exultant and with the Badger
triumphant in their midst, made their way back
to their several rooms. Here stock was taken
of the casualties incurred, when it was found
that not a few black eyes and bruises Were in
evidence. The Badger?s nose was bleeding as
the result of a violent concussion with a door;
Belton was proudly displaying an eye that was
already yellowing; several were busy examining
bruises on arms and shins; while the usually
immaculate Pauncefote had all the appearance
of having been caught up in a tornado.
?It was a glorious victory!? chanted the
Microbe, executing a war dance on his bed.
?Let us gloat, my brothers'! Let us sing pseans
of praise! Long live the Lambs I? ?
?Cave, you chaps!? cried Belton suddenly,
?here?s Cop wick!?
The prefect?s merry whistle was heard as he
climbed the stairs to the upper floors. A good
sportsman, he gave ample notice of his return
to his quarters. In a moment the raiders had
dispersed. When Copwick made his round


by way of satisfying his sense of duty, every
member of the house was snug in his bed; not
a sound broke the stillness of the night except
the steady breathing of the alleged sleepers,
except, too, an occasional smothered laugh that
could not be suppressed. The prefect visited
each room in turn, passed along the aisles with-
out a comment, though he noted odd cricket
pads and belts strewn on the floor, and proceeded
thoughtfully to his own cubicle.
Eventful as the evening had been, there was
yet to follow something of more startling im-
port. In Gideon?s house, after the intervention
of Francis, the excitement quickly died down.
Within a short time its inhabitants settled
themselves to quiet slumber ?all, that is, with
one exception. Falconer ??Spotty? Falconer,
as he was known ?one of the successful boat?s
crew, had received a nasty blow in the mouth
during the battle that had aroused a dormant
tooth trouble to action. He lay now in his bed,
tossing restlessly from side to side as the racked
nerve tortured him. He held a hand to the
aching jaw, pinched the flesh as a counter-
irritant ?but all in vain. The jarred nerve still


jumped and jumped and his soul found no
peace.
Suddenly he bethought himself that young
Benham had a stick of menthol in his bedside
locker. He crept out of bed and stole across
to the other?s side. Benham was soundly
asleep, but a few shakes brought him to a sit-
ting posture, drowsily demanding ?what?s
up??
Falconer explained his need, and Benham
good-naturedly probed among his effects until
the desired menthol case was found. With this
the sufferer from toothache returned to his own
bed. He stood there, by the window, in order to
avail himself of the moonlight filtering in, and
unscrewed the cap from the case. Then he rub-
bed the menthol stick freely around the source
of trouble. He was doing this and experiencing
the relief that the smarting stuff already
afforded when something moving in the garden
below the window attracted his attention. He
paused in his task and moved closer t6 the
pane. Pressing his face against this, and for-
getting his tooth for the moment, Falconer
peered into the semi-darkness.
Again something moved?down there by a


clump of rhododendron bushes. Then a figure
emerged, a dark, sinister, crouching figure that
ran swiftly across the grass to the opposite side
and disappeared round the corner of the build-
ing.
In that brief interval, however, Falconer took
notice of a large, broad-brimmed hat that came
well down over its owner?s head, of a black
cloak or cap, of the Inverness pattern that
swung behind the man as he moved. That
was all that he had time to observe, but the
sight was enough to shake the junior?s nerves.
The apparition was startling. It was phan-
tomlike, weird! No thought of possible bur-
glars or other undesirable night-visitants en-
tered Falconer?s mind. The remembrance of
the ghost scare of some weeks back recurred to
him vividly. This ?this must be the spirit of
the old monk again! The fellows were right:
he did walk the school at night! That monk-
ish hat! (Falconer had hazy ideas as to the
headgear favoured by priors of olden days.) That
sombre cloak! There could be no mistaking
them. He had seen the ghost-monk at last!
With a queer flutter at his heart he watched
in vain a few moments more for the re-appear-


ance of the dread figure; then he crept back
into bed. Thanks to the menthol, or to the
shock that he had received, the pain of the
tooth-ache had greatly lessened. So he settled
himself down in the sheets and, with mind much
disturbed at this recent extraordinary experi-
ence, passed off in due time into a troubled
sleep.
CHAPTER XL
An Evening in Dymchester.
That sinister figure in the politics of Middle
Europe, the Archduke Otto of Altburg, little
dreamed as he sat in his private room at the
Hotel de Royale in Paris that another factor
was about to enter into his schemes. Insig-
nificant though he would have appeared to that
princely personage, Richard Harper, aged
eighteen, late of Compton Prior School and
now junior clerk in the Southern Counties Bank
at Dymchester, was destined to play an import-


ant part in the fortunes of the House of
Altburg.
At this precise moment Harper was seated
at his desk overlooking the High Street of the
city, and was presumably immersed in his
ledger work. As a matter of fact, he was read-
ing a brief letter from Randall Cop wick, to the
effect that the writer intended to come to Dym-
chester on Wednesday afternoon ?two days
hence, and would be pleased to have tea with
him (Harper), as previously suggested, and a
chat over old times.
Harper grinned cheerfully over the intelli-
gence. He had always liked Coppy; a jolly,
sporting chap, who enjoyed a joke and could
take one in his turn. What further amused
him was the fact that, in another letter from
the school to hand that very morning, Shotter
had written to say that he and Mabberley pro-
posed to cut school on Wednesday after tea and
spend a few hours in Dynlchester. Things were
deadly slow at the old place since Harper had
left, and they felt just ready for a fling. So
they had decided to make a bolt for it and have
?a night out.? Would he (Harper) meet them
at the station, soon after 7.30, say?


Would he not ? Harper put both letters back
in his pocket and returned to his work. Things
seemed in train for a very pleasant evening
on the following Wednesday.
Having notified his old friend of his coming
visit, Copwick approached his house-master
for special leave to go to Dymchester. He had
important purchases to make there, and an
appointment he wished to keep. Mr. Kirke
raised no objection. Copwick?s conduct that
term had been irreproachable; he was a prefect
now, a responsible person, and he could be
trusted to behave himself. The desired permis-
sion was accordingly given.
Those twin spirits, Shotter and Mabberley,
entirely ignorant of Copwick?s proposal to
their mutual friend, Harper, made their own
plans for their ??fling.? On the Wednesday
evening, they would go to ?call-over? at 6.50
p.m., after which they would retire to their
common study for the usual spell of work.
They would see Parkyn or Copwick or Mason,
whichever was likely to be on duty, and make
things right about turning up to supper a bit
late. They were seniors themselves, and such


arrangements had been made in a friendly way
before.
Shotter saw no difficulties in the path as he
sat on the window-ledge of their room, dang-
ling his long legs. He eyed his chum amiably.
? Only thing to guard against,? he re-
marked, ? is running against one of the beaks
when we slip out, or someone like Lorrimer or
Monty. We?ll just have to be jolly careful.?
? Bet your life,? assented Mabberley cheer-
fully. ? It?s dead easy, if you go slow. Didn?t
we do it often enough when old Harper was
here? Let?s hope Coppy won?t be on duty on
Wednesday. Can?t make out the chap nowa-
days. He?s only just civiL-an? he used to be so
jolly thick with us.?
? Got the swelled head,? observed Shotter.
? Can?t stand being a prefect, and being in
with all the bloods. If our luck?s in it?ll be
Mason. He?s a long sight safer than old
Parkyn. I?ll get round him easy enough.?
And luck was with them. The next day they
learned that Mason had undertaken the duties
of house prefect for the evening of their pro-
posed jaunt. He listened with half an ear to
Shotter?s story of going down to the station

IT WAS A CLOSE HAND TO HAND COMBAT.




about a parcel he was expecting from home by
rail, and grunted that it would be ? all right.?
? I?ll be back as quick as I can,? added
Shotter, as he left the prefect?s study; but
Mason was deep again in the novel he was de-
vouring, and paid no further attention.
So the fateful day arrived?fateful for one of
the travellers to Dymchester, at any rate. At
half-past three Copwick took his ticket for the
city, where he arrived some twenty-five minutes
later. He spent some time visiting certain
shops, for his intimation to Mr. Kirke that he
was on shopping bent was perfectly genuine,
and then made his way to the bank where
Harper was engaged.
He found his old friend not quite ready to
leave, so waited outside for a quarter of an
hour. When Harper at last appeared, the two
boarded a tram and went to the western
quarter, past the Cathedral, wherein Harper
had his lodging. Here the latter?s landlady
had tea all prepared, so they sat down to enjoy
a well-spread table.
Knew you d like a change after school
fare,? said Harper, with a laugh. ? Try these
prawns, they?re prime. And there?s a topping


cold meat pie?onions in it?that Mrs. Griggs
has made herself. Advance Australia ! Pitch
into it. I?ll pour out tea. You can have some-
thing stronger afterwards if you like. You
haven?t forgotten the taste of 1 Old Highland,?
have you, Coppy??
The Australian gave a wry smile. ? ?Fraid
I have, Harper. Won?t do now I?m a nob, you
know. A prefect can?t gad about the village
like we used to do time back. No, old man, I?m
something of a reformed character.?
Harper threw back his head and laughed.
It was not a very wholesome laugh; it was too
loud and forced. But Harper himself was not
a very wholesome person. He was pasty of
complexion, pimply, and rather too fat and
flabby in appearance. His black hair was
plastered down upon his head, with the then
fashionable middle parting. Like the young
fellows of his class, he affected a bow tie of the
butterfly variety, it being a bright blue with
large white spots. By way of contrast to this
unhealthy-looking youth, Copwick made a
pleasing picture. His good-looking, clean-cut
features showed the bronze tint of one who
enjoyed open-air exercise; his blue eyes looked


at you directly and honestly; and his ready
laugh had the true ring in it. He was a type
of schoolboy such as one meets quite commonly,
thank heaven! in our big schools.
?Reformed character! Ha, ha!? Harper
exploded again. ? Good old Coppy! No more
Priory Inn evenings, then? No more beer and
skittles and half-a-crown on a hundred up,
eh??
Cop wick nodded smilingly.
? How do old Shotter and the Bounder take
it?? went on the other. ? I?ll bet they haven?t
changed much since last term. What??
Copwick explained the situation of things at
the school, how he had drifted apart from his
former associates since coming back, and how
he had formed new friendships?with Lorri-
mer, with Montgomery, with Toby Wenham,
and with the new chap, Von Altburg.
This started the ball of conversation well
rolling. They had finished tea, and now seated
themselves in comfortable chairs, while Mrs.
Griggs cleared away. Then Harper produced
a box of cigarettes and they lit up.
?Von Altburg? Rummy name that,? said
the host. ? German chap ??


? No,? said Copwick. and proceeded to tell
something of Karl?s advent to Compton Prior.
Harper was immediately interested. The
fact that the school numbered a European
prince among its inmates, and the touch of
mystery that surrounded him. made him in-
quisitive. He wanted to know all there was to
be known, and the Australian related what
was common knowledge ?the strange assault
upon the boy and his consequent confinement
in the Sannv. Incidentally, he mentioned the
encounter between Karl and Mabberley and the
latter?s discomfiture.
Harper gave a guffaw at this. ?So the
old Bounder got a bit of his own back, did he ??
he asked. ? That foreign chap must have
something in him. Seems a decent cove, for
all he?s a prince. I?d like to meet him. By the
way, Coppy, that reminds me. I didn?t say
anything to you about it, but Shotter and Mab-
berley are both due here this evening. I
promised to meet them at the station round
about seven-thirty.?
Shotter coming to Dymchester? And the
Bounder too? Copwick stared at his host, and


Harper, reading the question in his eyes,
nodded.
? It?s a fact,? he announced, emitting a
cloud of smoke from his mouth. ? Half-past
seven. Plenty of time yet. They want a fling
in the city. Expect we?ll take in a show at the
Empire. Care to come ??
Copwick reflected. It was pretty clear that
the two Kirke seniors had taken French leave.
It would be a serious thing for them if they
were found out, and he thought that perhaps
he ought to see them on their arrival and per-
suade them to abandon the silly project. If
they did stop, Harper was not likely to be anv
good to them. He would get them into mis-
chief, and then grave trouble might follow.
Yes, he concluded, he would see them. Rotters
as they were, it was up to him for the school?s
sake to stop this stupidity.
? I rather think I will. Harper,? he said
slowly; ? I mean, I will meet them with you.
I shan?t have time, however, for the Empire.
Kirke gave me leave to come here, of course,
but he won?t expect me to be late.?
? Righto,? responded the other cheerfully.


? push off when you like. We can amuse our-
selves, I dare say.
Shotter ?Shotter ?Shotter. The fellow was
in Cop wick?s mind all the time that Harper
talked. He remembered what the latter had
written some time before. There had been an
unpleasant suggestion about Shotter in con-
nection with the Bradham Cup race the pre-
vious term. When the conversation came to
a pause a little later, the Australian put the
question point-blank ; what did Harper mean
by that reference to Shotter and the boat-race ?
And why should Shotter be asked if he knew
anything about oars?
Harper threw his cigarette away, passed the
case across, and then lit another himself.
?Ah!? he exclaimed with a knowing wink,
? that?s telling, isn?t it? More than meets the
eye, my boy. What, indeed?? He laughed
again. ? Did you kick the Badger for me,
Coppy?? he asked. ? Cheeky young beggar,
he is, he and his Tong. I hope you did. ?
But Copwick was not to be diverted from
his point.
? Keep to Shotter,? he remarked curtly.
? What you intimated was jolly unpleasant,


Harper. You as much as said that Shotter?
that Shotter ?
? Played the deuce with the Gideon stroke?s
oar, eh? Well, what if I meant that? What
if I believed something of the sort? I can?t
prove it, actually, but ?well, Coppy old man,
I?ve a very strong suspicion that way. You
see ? He leaned forward confidentially, and
related how, earlier in the previous term,
Shotter had incurred several debts with him
through betting, losing time after time, until
the total amount owing was three pounds, fif-
teen shillings. Then came the race for the
Bradham. It was Shotter?s proposal that he
should go double or quits with him on the
result: Shotter to back Kirke?s house to win.
Now, the Gideon?s house crew were the
favourites, hot favourites. They were the
better eight undoubtedly. Shotter would not
have gone double or quits if he had not seen
some way to make the conclusion of the race
a certainty. That was Harper?s point. Kirke?s
had won?won by a fluke, so to speak. But
they had won, and there had been the subse-
quent inquiry and the statement as to foul play.
Put two and two together, my dear chap, ?


he concluded, ? and what?s the answer? I
gave Ted Shotter his 1.0. U. back receipted
and I said nothing to him at the time. Now
then, he?s coming to Dymchester to-night, isn?t
he? We?ll ask him when we see him ?you and
I?what he knows about oars. Eh ??
The whole business seemed to be getting more
and more unpleasant to Cop wick. If Harper?s
theory was correct, and it appeared plausible
enough, the suspicion against Shotter was justi-
fiable. He rather thought that he ought to
stop ?for one reason to stop the two from
making fools of themselves; secondly, to try to
sift this matter of the boat-race mystery to its
core. It might, after all, be groundless sus-
picion. Shotter was a bit of a gambler; he
took a big chance on Kirke?s bringing off the
race?and he won. That was all, perhaps.
Copwick devoutly hoped that it was all, but he
did not care to voice what was actually in his
mind.
He and Harper talked on for some time; then
the latter looked at his watch and declared it
was well after seven.
? Better be moving,? he said.
They got their hats and passed out into the


crowded street. As they turned the corner by
the Cathedral, Harper pointed out the Empire,
glittering with electric light, and with queues
already formed at the cheaper doors. Topping
show there, that week, he explained; a big star
down from London, some wonderful acrobats,
and a screamingly funny sketch. Cop wick
nodded absently, and murmured something; he
was too occupied by his own thoughts to pay
attention to what his companion was saying.
Presently, they came to the road leading to
the station, and walked leisurely along it, for
there were still several minutes to go before the
train was due.
Five minutes after time the ?Up Slow ? from
Compton Prior steamed in, and the two
'Kirkeite seniors jumped out on to the platform.
Their surprise at meeting Copwick was as
marked as the cordiality of their greeting to
their old chum, Harper. Copwick quickly
explained the cause of his presence in Dym-
chester. Then, as they strolled out to the
street, he took Shotter aside and pressed his
point home.
?You chaps are number one fools to bolt
here,? he said sharply. ?It?s a mug?s game,


Ted, and I want you and Mabberley to chuck
it and come back with me.?
?Not on your life!? replied Shotter with a
grin. ? We?re all right. Mason?s on house
duty to-night, he?s promised to let us in quietly
and say nothing. And we can rely on you , of
course,? he added.
Cop wick argued and expostulated in vain.
Shotter was determined to carry the thing
through. They had got away without any mis-
hap; they had ? sported their oak ? in the
study, and, for all that anyone knew, were still
swotting hard. No, it was a jolly fine wheeze
to have an evening out with old Dick Harper,
and they meant to enjoy themselves.
<c So that?s that !? said Shotter emphatically.
The Australian was non-plussed for the
moment. He walked on with them in silence,
his mind working rapidly. Then he made his
decision; he would keep with them; perhaps he
could yet persuade the two to return before
there was any danger of discovery, and, at any
rate, he would be on hand to prevent them get-
ting into any trouble.
Harper?s proposal of a visit to the Empire
was approved. ? Topping show there,? he


repeated; so they wended their way to the
music- hall.
The performance began at 7.45, and the first
turn was already in progress when they arrived.
They booked seats in the dress circle, in the bar
of which Harper was evidently a popular per-
sonage.
They resorted here after three-quarters of an
hour?s enjoyment of the varied programme,
and again Copwick tried his hardest to get his
two schoolfellows to accede to his suggestion
and return home.
? Nothing of the sort,? declared Shotter,
loudly, glass in hand, for Harper had again
? stood treat.? ? Cut along yourself, and be
a good boy. Go and play with your Von Alt-
burg ?your blessed prince. Mab and 111 catch
the 9.5. It?s the last train, you know, on our
potty little line. We?ll be in the house in time,
and no one the wiser. Cheerio, Harper !? He
drank the other?s health with gusto.
? Jolly bar, this,? remarked Harper, look-
ing round at the people who were seated or
lounging near him. He did not note that one
gentleman, a foreigner presumably, was eyeing


him closely. �� Note we stay here a bit. It?s
some time before the sketch comes on.?
There was a matter to be discussed with
Shotter while Copwick was with them, and he
took the opportunity to put a leading question.
Having the same old luck still, old bean??
he enquired. � 'Remember our little business
over the Bradham??
Shotter?s face dropped slightly. The un-
accustomed taste of whisky, well watered
though it had been, had set his nerves tingling.
He was on the alert now. What did the beggar
mean by that ?
� ?That was a stroke of luck an? no mistake,?
Harper continued. ?Stroke \ Ha! Ha! Jolly
good, that! It was stroke?s oar that broke,
wasn?t it??
�� Nothing funny about that,? retorted the
other. �� Rotten luck for Gideon's, I say.?
?Yes, and jolly lucky for Kirke?s. Jolly lucky
for those who had bets on the race. Jolly lucky
for those who betted on what they knew was a
cert.?
? What do you mean by that?? asked
Shotter, with a meaning look in his pale, shifty
eyes.


Harper temporised. He meant to play
his man like a skilful fisherman.
? You didn?t go double or quits with me on
the race ?over those old bets of ours ?I sup-
pose?? he asked.
Shotter jumped at the opening offered. Cop-
wick was in hearing; he had better deny the
transaction.
? Double or quits!? he retorted. ? I paid
you what I owed ?you know that. The guv?nor
happened to send along some cash, and I got
square with you. What?s the trouble about
it?? The lie came readily enough to his lips.
Harper snorted. ? You liar I he said, con-
fronting Shotter with narrowing eyes, ?you
liar! Hear that, Mabberley ? And you, Cop-
wick? He says he paid me what was owing,
when, as a matter of fact, he went double or
quits with me on the Bradham ?and won ! He
knows he won! And he knows why he !? ?
Harper advanced a step closer to the other.
What about the 1.0. U. I gave you back ?? he
asked. ? Suppose I can prove that ?eh??
?It?s a lie,? stuttered Shotter, and he
glanced quickly towards the other two. ? ? There
?there?wasn?t any 1.0. U.!?


You?re a mean skunk!? exclaimed Harper
angrily. ? A dirty, mean skunk ! You bet me
double or quits over the race ?and you won.
Won because you fixed the Gideon stroke?s oar
so that it would crack upV? Harper?s face was
tensely white now, and his voice trembled with
rage. ?I knew it!? he said, turning to Copwick
and raising his voice; ?I knew it all along!?
and I know it now! He?s lied to me, the hound,
and he can?t deny what I say!?
Less noise there, gentlemen, please!? said
an attendant, crossing over to them. Harper
made a rude retort, which led to a further
warning, and Copwick, taking advantage of
the interruption, endeavoured to persuade his
companions to leave the place.
Come on,? he said. ? I?m sick of this!
Let?s chuck it. I?m going along to the station;
you two had better come too. We?ve got to get
back to the school.?
With obvious ill-will, and still fuming,
Harper agreed, and with Shotter and Mabber-
ley close behind him, Copwick led the way down
the stairs.
Out in the street Harper walked some way


with the others. He was determined to have
the last word.
?You chaps heard what I said in there, he
observed. ? Well, it?s true?every word! Take
that skunk back with you, Coppy, and make
every investigation if you like. You want to
know who was responsible for the breaking of
the Gideon oar ? I told you ?ask Shotter!
Ask him ?ask him now! The hound ! Cheated
me out of three quid fifteen, he did! Bah!?
He turned on his heel and left them. ? Good
night,? he called back over his shoulder, and
quickened his pace.
?Good-night,? responded Cop wick. Then he
stepped out briskly stationwards, the two others
following silently behind. What an evening it
had been! What an evening!


CHAPTER XII.
The Ingenuous Mr. Baumer.
We left Harper in angry mood on his way
back to his lodgings. He was annoyed at his
evening?s enjoyment having been spoiled by this
unpleasantness, though he admitted to himself
that he had laid himself out to quarrel with
Shotter. He strode on with an ugly frown upon
his pasty features, ignoring the salutations of
one or two friends whom he encountered.
There was no ignoring the attentions of a
certain gentleman, however, who, standing by
the main entrance to the Dymchester Empire
as he passed, stepped forward and touched him
on the shoulder.
Pardon me,? said the stranger, affably,
but, if I am not mistaken, I had the pleasure
of seeing you in the theatre just now??
Harper looked up inquiringly. ?In the


Empire ? I was there twenty minutes ago, per-
haps. What of it??
His questioner was a tall, broad-shouldered
man with a florid face, and an iron-grey
moustache.
? It is an impertinence on my part,? he said,
speaking with a marked accent, ? but I was
interested in your companions. They wore a
school cap ?the Compton Prior cap, was it
not ? As lam thinking of sending my own boy
there, I was naturally interested.?
Harper explained that his friends had come
over from the school for the evening, and that
he had just seen them off by train.
? Ah,? said the stranger, though his ejacu-
lation sounded like ? Ach,? ? I thought as
much. And you were of the school, too ? Yes ?
That is more interesting. You can tell me
much that I wish to know.?
He took Harper by the arm and pointed to
a restaurant on the opposite side of the road.
? A bit of supper and a glass of wine, eh? If
you can spare me a few minutes of your time, I
shall be obliged. But you have an appointment
perhaps??
Harper replied that he was quite free for


some time, and accompanied his new-found
friend across the street. Inside the restaurant,
the latter selected a small table for two in a
farther corner. They seated themselves, and
the order was given for the table d?hote meal.
? My name is Baumer,? said the stranger;
? it is fitting that I should introduce myself.
And you are? Mr. Harper? I thank you. A
German name, Baumer, as you will note,? he
continued pleasantly. ? But lam naturalised.
There are many German families that are
English now, are there not ? Some years ago a
name like mine was regarded with suspicion,
even with contempt. But individuals must
suffer for the mistakes of nations. And late
differences are forgotten. Bygones are by-
gones; we have the present to consider.? He
waved a broad hand indicative of the abounding
generosity of the British people.
? Now,? he smiled, as he watched his guest
begin upon the hors d?oeuvres, ?we will devote
ourselves to the meal and talk afterwards. A
white wine or a red, do you think??
Flattered by this deference to his taste,
Harper plumped for a red vintage; it looked
better in a wine-glass. Then the meal pro-


ceeded, with just a little light talk anent the
Empire performance.
At its conclusion, Mr. Baumer regaled him-
self with a noble-looking cigar. Harper accep-
ted a cigarette in preference, and smoked with
a feeling of more satisfaction than he had
previously been experiencing. A funny old
stick, this Baumer chap, but free with his money
and disposed to be friendly.
?The school ?Compton Prior school,? ob-
served his host, pulling strongly at the cigar, the
fumes of which assured Harper that he had been
wise in his choice. ? Now tell me of the school,
will you ? lam sending my boy there next term,
and I should like to know about the place from
one who is so qualified to speak.?
Thus induced, Harper talked volubly of the
school, of its historic foundation, the size of the
building, its division into houses on the usual
public school lines, and dwelt intimately on the
personalities of its masters. Mr. Baumer?s ig-
norance of the customs of English schools was
appalling; the man thought that every boy had
a separate bedroom, and that he received
special tutoring from his own house-master.
Harper put him right on these points, and en-


larged upon the athletic training which was
part of the curriculum.
To all this Mr. Baumer listened attentively.
He was infinitely patient, acquiring knowledge
by one question after another, and occasionally
making a memorandum in a little gold-cased
note-book.
�C I am obliged to you, Mr. Harper, greatly
obliged,? he exclaimed. �� Another cigarette?
Virginian this side, Turkish the other. Yes, it
is extremely kind of you to give me this valuable
information. I take it that a boy with a foreign
name will not be unwelcome among his fellows ?
You understand ? Baumer ?as I told you?has
an un-English ring about it, for all one?s natur-
alisation.?
Harper reassured him quickly upon this
point, too. He remembered the case of Oppen-
heim, a senior in his own time. There was no
feeling about him in the school. An awfully
decent chap he was, too. And at the present
moment there was a fellow named Altburg there
?von Altburg, if you please! As German a
name as you could wish to find, though its owner
declared he was a Hungarian or something.


Mr. Baumer?s eyes had a peculiar gleam in
them which Harper failed to notice.
?That is so?? he said. ?Then, my boy has
nothing to fear. ?Von Altburg,? you say?
There is a royal house of that name in Europe.
Is this boy??
?Says he?s a prince,? responded Harper,
?though goodness knows if it?s true.? He
laughed loudly and easily. The excellent sup-
per, to which he had done full justice, together
with the very palatable wine, put him in the
best of humours.
?Can?t say much about him myself,? he
added, ?but one of my friends told me there
was a lot of mystery round the chap.?
?Mystery?? His host displayed his even,
white teeth in a broad smile. ?Are we not all
mysteries ourselves ? And as to a name ?
?What?s in a name?? as your immortal Shake-
speare says. But?tut?tut! It is getting late;
I have a visit to make and must be going.?
He had already settled the bill, with a hand-
some tip for the waiter, and they walked out of
the restaurant to the obsequious bowing of Mon-
sieur, Madame and the staff. On the pavement


Mr. Baumer shook his young guest warmly by
the hand.
�t A very pleasant evening,? he remarked,
?very pleasant indeed. No, don?t thank me,
the pleasure is mine. I am delighted to have
met you, Mr. Harper.? He turned to go, and
then, halting suddenly as if struck by an after-
thought, he said : ?I wonder if you will be free
on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Harper? I am
staying in Dymchester over the week-end?l
am in the wine business and am seeing several
buyers here ?and I am thinking I might run
over to Compton Prior school in the car. Now,
if you could join me ?just show me the place?
not to stop, you know?just a look round?l
should be more than obliged. Could you do
this??
Harper reflected that he could; really, he had
nothing fixed for Saturday afternoon, and a
run out in a motor car seemed to offer a pleasant
prospect. He told Mr. Baumer, therefore,
that he would be delighted to accept the invita-
tion. The address of his lodgings having been
noted, and the hour of their meeting fixed, the
two parted, Harper sauntering in the direction
of a billiard saloon to ?knock the balls about


for a bit? ere going home. Mr. Baumer betook
himself to his appointment, very pleased indeed
on his part at the encounter .
During the time that Harper was thus occu-
pied Copwick was conducting his two compan-
ions to the school. They arrived safely some
ten minutes before the half hour and, passing
through the playground, made their way across
the quadrangle to their house. Mr. Kirke, who
had been spending an hour with Mr. Campion,
overtook them as they entered.
?Back all right, I see, Copwick,? he re-
marked. ?Had a pleasant time, I hope?? He
nodded to the others, who, he assumed, had
just come from some neighbouring study.
?Good night, boys.? The master passed up
the steps into the house and the three followed.
Shotter had been silent during the journey,
leaving the talking to Copwick and Mabberley.
He made a curt response to the prefect?s ?good-
night? and swung off moodily to his dormitory.
Copwick, seeking his own bed, went to sleep
with a perturbed mind, the events of the evening
having left him in no little perplexity:
All the next day he saw little of Shotter or


his room-mate. The former studiously avoided
him, though the fact that he made no request
as to silence concerning the unauthorised trip
to Dymchester showed that he relied upon the
loyalty of his erstwhile friend.
To Copwick, the problem of what course he
should pursue, in the light of what had trans-
pired the previous evening, seemed beyond solu-
tion. It was a matter in which he needed coun-
sel. He resolved to consult Lorrimer at an early
opportunity, but the School Captain was not
easily captured. He was busy with various
engagements during the hours between class
work.
In the evening, however, Parkyn had a ?sup-
per? in his study, and there were gathered Cop-
wick, Lorrimer, Wenham and Montgomery.
During the repast and after, the talk ran on the
cricket match with the Dymchester Grammar-
ians which was fixed for the following Satur-
day. In the background the Badger, Parkyn?s
fag, was busy with domestic details.
?Hurry up, youngster!? exclaimed the pre-
fect testily. ?You don?t want to be all night
putting a few things away. Confound your
clumsiness!? he cried, as the Badger let slip a


pot of jam that crashed to the floor to its utter
ruin.
?Sorry, Parkyn!? murmured the fag apolo-
getically.
?Sorry, be blowed!? was the angry response.
?Mop that beastly mess up and scoot! Do you
hear! You?ll have to owe me a pot.?
The Badger on his knees set to work to repair
the damages. Meanwhile, Lorrimer turned to
Copwick with a question as to his visit to Dym-
Chester. The Australian narrated his call on
Harper, about whom they were interested to
hear news, but said nothing about his encoun-
ter with Shotter and Mabberley. It was not
the time to discuss that matter.
Montgomery joined in the conversation.
?Used to be a great pal of Shotter?s, didn?t
he?? he asked. ?Do they keep up correspon-
dence ? ? ?
Copwick gave an uneasy laugh. ?Not much
pallyness about them at present,? he rejoined.
?I gathered they?d had a row. Over some
money business. That fool Shotter was in debt
to Harper?been betting, I understand, last
term. There was some question about an
I 0 U that Harper said he had from Shotter.


But Shotter denied having given him one ?said
he?d paid him what he owed, all the same.?
The Badger, nearing the end of his task,
pricked up his ears.
?An I 0 U?? asked Lorrimer. ?I believe
I?d rather take Harper?s word about that than
Shotter?s. With all his faults Dick Harper
wasn?t a liar!?
?Excuse me, Parkyn,? interrupted the Bad-
ger, his little dark eyes beaming as he jerked
himself upright. ?I want to say??
?You want to cut along out of this room,?
replied his fag-master promptly. ?You young
beggars yap too much. And you?re too ready
to listen to what your betters are talking about.
Come on, hook it!?
?But that IOU ?? protested the Badger
?I?l know something about that!?
?You know something about Shotter?s
I 0 U?? asked Lorrimer, putting up a hand
to silence Parkyn.
The Badger nodded and grinned. ?Yes, I
do. I?ve got it downstairs?in my locker. I
found it ??
? ?Never mind where you found it, 5 ? said Lorri-
mer. ?Cut along and get it. Quick!?


The Badger needed no second bidding. He
darted out of the room and they heard him tak-
ing the stairs three at a time. When he re-
turned a minute or two later he held a dirty,
ragged piece of paper in his hand.
?Here it is, Lorrimer,? he exclaimed.
?Power and I found it in the cellars that night
we had the ghost hunt. Found it in a corner ?
all torn like this.? He handed the precious
scrap to the Captain.
Lorrimer took the paper and read the scrawl,
while Copwick and Montgomery peered over his
shoulder.
?He?s right,? said the first-named. ?It?s the
I 0 U without a doubt. ?I 0 U three pound?
?the rest of the amount has gone ??signed
E. R. Shotter.? And here?s Harper?s signature
written across. ?Received, R. Harper, Boat-
race day.? ?
Copwick gave a low whistle. ?My hat!? he
ejaculated. ?Harper was right! What a liar
the chap is ! ?
?You mean Shotter??
Copwick nodded, and his face was grave.
?Send your fag packing, will you, Parkyn??
he added. ?We?ve something important to dis-
cuss.?


The Badger was accordingly dismissed, to
return to the Den with the consciousness that he
had been playing an important part in what
was a serious business. Jolly lucky that he
didn?t chuck that bit of paper awayT Ted
Shotter?the cad ! ?was evidently going to get
it in the neck.
That the junior?s surmise was correct was
evidenced by the gravity with which the party
in Parkyn?s study listened to the tale that Cop-
wick now unfolded. He told them of his con-
versation with Harper relative to the other?s
mysterious reference in his letter to Shotter and
the boat-race. Told them Harper?s insin-
uation as to foul play on the part of Shotter,
and of the open accusation that the former had
made in the bar lounge of the Dymchester Em-
pire. The fact that Shotter and Mabberley had
broken bounds to visit the city had to be dis-
closed now.
?He denied ever having given an I O U,?
said Copwick, in conclusion. ?Denied it to
Harper?s face. And we know he lied. But he
didn?t deny what Harper said about his having
made the Bradham bet a certainty by tamper-
ing with one of the Gideon oars! Just took it


lying down ! I?m afraid?l?m afraid it?s all too
true ! What a blackguard the chap must be ! ?
Lorrimer made an exclamation of disgust.
? ?lt?s a dirty business !? he said grimly. � ?What
are we going to do ? Put the whole thing to the
Head, or have Shotter up before us?make a
prefects? meeting of it??
They discussed the pros and cons of the situa-
tion, and finally it was decided that Lorrimer
should inform Mr. Kirke, the house-master par-
ticularly concerned, and with him lay the facts
before Dr. Atterbury. With this conclusion the
party broke up, Lorrimer proceeding at once
to Mr. Kirke?s room on his fateful errand.
CHAPTER XIII.
A Decided Step Forward.
All that the school in general learned the next
day was that Shotter of the Upper Fifth had
left suddenly and in disgrace. Copwick, Lorri-
mer and a few other seniors alone knew of the
interview that had taken place in Dr. Atter-


bury?s study, an interview at which Harper,
summoned by an urgent telegram, had at-
tended. The whole story of Shotter?s betting
transactions was there exposed; he was con-
fronted with the I 0 U, the existence of which
he had still persisted in denying, and finally ?
his nerve having broken down?he confessed to
the miserable business of the Gideon oar.
That he had broken bounds on the eventful
Wednesday by going to Dymchester was a
minor offence in the light of these graver trans-
gressions. Dr. Atterbury felt that he had no
other course open to him than instant expul-
sion. The unfortunate boy?s father was imme-
diately wired to, and Shotter left Compton
Prior by a morning train.
As for Mabberlev, his associate in the sur-
*/
reptitious visit to the city, that youth received
a ?dressing down? from the Head that left him
in a severely chastened mood. He had further
the punishment of being ?gated? for the rest of
the term, with an imposition that entailed much
arduous work on his part.
In the Lower School the Badger sunned him-
self in the brilliant light that shone upon him
as a prominent factor in Shotter?s undoing.


His prestige among his followers rose with a
bound. In the interest and excitement caused
by this sudden development, the new ghost story
that ?Spotty? Falconer had sprung upon the
denizens of the Common Room fell very flat.
His tale of the mysterious monk-like figure flit-
ting across the garden in the dim moonlight had
been received at first with cries of derision.
?Seeing things ain?t good for you, Spotty,?
said his hearers. ?Take something for it. Go
and see the matron, old chap.?
The Badger, with a recollection of the con-
necting pipe between the two cellars, and a
clear idea as to the practical joke played upon
him and the others, completed Falconer?s dis-
comfiture. Overcome by ridicule, the Gideonite
retired into his shell, and was half convinced
after all that he had been the victim of an hallu-
cination.
Came now the great day of the match with
the Dymchester Grammar School. On the
Saturday morning?a whole holiday having
been decreed ?Compton Prior welcomed its
visitors in full force. At two-thirty sharp the
home team took the field, and the leading bats-
men of the Grammarians opened the game. We


cannot here enter into a full description of what
proved to be a most hard-fought and therefore
exciting match. It must suffice to say that
Dymchester in their first innings knocked up
the respectable score of 157 runs. Compton
Prior, thanks to the efforts of Montgomery,
Lorrimer, Mason and Parr-Smith, declared for
255, leaving their opponents to get close on a
hundred runs to avoid a single innings defeat.
It was a great and glorious game, resulting in
a win for the school by a considerable margin.
The Dymchester wickets fell in the second in-
nings as by a miracle. The tricky slow bowling
of Merrick, who was given a place in the Eleven
for the first time, worked wonders. He trapped
the crack batsmen of the Grammarians into
being caught in the long field, and loud and
prolonged was the cheering from the serried
ranks of the school supporters as the score-
board registered the fall of the wickets.
We would gladly like to linger among the
spectators of this memorable match, particular-
ly in that section of the field where Kirkeite
and Gideonite vied with School-house and Cam-
pion enthusiast in rending the skies with their
shouts. Matters of more moment demand our
attention.


At the time that this herculean struggle was
taking place a high-powered open motor-car,
resplendent in blue enamel, glided down the
main road from the direction of Dymchester
and pulled up a short distance away from the
school buildings.
?So this is Compton Prior?? said Mr. Bau-
mer, as he leant back on the cushion seat.
?A very fine place, indeed?very fine. Those
massive stone walls, Mr, Harper, they bear the
signs of Time upon them, the ?mellowing hand.?
And that is the school chapel, with the cross,
you say ? Beautiful?beautiful in the
extreme! ? ?
Mr. Baumer pulled at his cigar (as obnoxious
as had been the former ones) and enjoyed the
delightful view before him. Harper, by his side,
pointed out with eagerness the several features
of the school as they presented themselves.
There was the Schoolhouse, where Dr. Atter-
bury had his private apartments; there Kirke?s
and Gideon?s houses, and between them and the
former lay the great quadrangle. As the motor
car moved farther down the road Campion?s
house, with its more modern structure came into
sight, and they obtained a glimpse beyond it of
the school playing-fields.


?Seems to be a match on,? said Harper,
craning his neck as he looked over the side.
There?s a lot of shouting going on and I can
see some of the players through the trees. That
accounts, then, for so few of the fellows being
about the place.?
As a matter of fact, Compton Prior had the
appearance of being deserted. Only an occa-
sional figure moved about in one of the quads,
or showed itself at a window. To Harper this
was quite as he would have wished. His recent
interview with the Head, who had seen fit to
make some very strong comments on his con-
duct, induced no desire in him to be recognised
on this flying visit. Had not Mr. Baumer
pressed him, indeed, and had not the pros-
pect of a motor run been so alluring, he would
certainly have refrained from coming.
But the trip had been delightful. Mr.
Baumer, stout fellow, was a charming com-
panion; he had cigarettes innumerable and an
always handy flask, and he seemed to have taken
a particular fancy to the youthful bank clerk.
?I?ll wager that you boys had great larks at
your school, eh?? remarked Mr. Baumer, as
they rested by the wayside. ?Trust boys for
getting into mischief. Eh, Mr. Harper??


Harper grinned. The insinuation was pleas-
ing. Larks 1 He assured his friend that the
rigours of school life could be lessened if one
were ingenious and daring enough. For Mr.
Baumer?s edification he related two or three
splendid ?japes? in which he had taken part,
such as breaking bounds to visit the carnival at
Bournewick one night?he and Shotter and
another?getting out by a window and return-
ing by the same means. He had a story, too,
of a great evening in the Priory Inn, when he
won an improvised billiard tournament and con-
sumed large quantities of beer.
?Felt awfully rocky getting back, I can tell
you,? he observed, ?but the luck was with me.
Never met a beak or any of the prefects, and
got into my house O.K. Yes,? he reflected
thoughtfully, ?we used to make things hum in
my time, I can tell you. They?re a tamer lot
of chaps at the school now.?
Mr. Baumer gave an approving laugh and
swung the car round. ?Let?s have a look at
your old house,? he said. ?Kirke?s was its
name, was it not??
That?s right,? replied Harper. ?I was in
Kirke?s most of my time at the school. Only the


last term I was shifted to the new house ?Cur-
tis?s, it was then, before Campion came ?be-
cause I made things a bit too sultry in the other
place.?
?You were what you call ?hot stuff,? eh??
Mr. Baumer smiled round at him.
?Now, that is Kirke?s, you say? And you
used to get in by the window. That bottom one,
at the corner, I suppose??
?No, the second on the right, from the but-
tress,? explained his companion. ?You get on
to that lean-to, hold on by the gutter-pipe and
swing on to the ledge. It?s an easy job, if you re
nippy. The catch of the window opens quite
simply.?
?Excellent!? ejaculated Mr. Baumer, and he
put on his eye-glasses to see the point indicated
more clearly. ?Excellent! you young rascals!
What it is to be a boy! ? ?
He discoursed amiably on his own school
days in the Fatherland and the rigorous disci-
pline that was there enforced. Then, looking at
his watch, he gave a grunt. ?Better be mov-
ing, I think,? he said. ?It?s been a most en-
joyable run, thanks to you, Mr. Harper. lam
so glad to have seen your old school. My boy
will be happy there. Now we?ll go back to


Dymchester? (he pronounced it Dymgester)
?another way. What do you say? There is
the road over the bridge and round by Westham
and Little Tackleton.?
He turned the car round again and they pro-
ceeded slowly down the road past the school.
As they went by the block that included Cam-
pion?s house, its red brick front standing out
boldly in the sunlight, Harper looked up and
saw two figures, a man and a boy, at one of the
windows. He nudged his companion.
?Must be the new House-master,? he mur-
mured; ?that was Curtis?s old room. And that
chap with him?look! That?s the new foreign
boy, I believe?that von Altburg I told you of.
Looks like the cove Coppy described to me.?
Mr. Baumer was particularly interested in
this revelation. He slowed up as they passed
the house and his eyes roved rapidly across the
front of the building. In their survey they
noted several important details and did not
omit a searching glance at the two standing by
the open window.
Mr. Campion?s eye rested casually upon the
car and its occupants.
Anybody you know, 'Karl ?? he asked of the


boy by his side. ?That big chap driving seems
to be regarding us curiously.?
Karl bent forward giving Mr. Baumer a
nearer view of his features.
?No,? he answered curtly. ?A couple of
strangers looking round, I suppose. I?d like
to know how the match is going, sir,? he added;
?there?s a lot of shouting down in the field.
Let?s go back and find out.?
Mr. Campion closed the window and the pair
disappeared from view.
With another grunt of satisfaction Mr.
Baumer let out his clutch and the car sped on
its way down the road, to cross the bridge over
the Dibbin and turn in the direction of Dym-
chester.
He had only one more question to put to
Harper on the journey back. Was his old study
on the same side of the house as the room of
Mr. Campion? When he learned that it was
on the south side, overlooking the garden??the
study with the big latticed window that opens
outwards,? said Harper, ?it?s got the date of
the building just over it, 1909? ?he was more
than pleased. He chatted and laughed all the
rest of the journey, and deposited his young


friend at the Cathedral corner with every ex-
pression of good will.
That same evening, after an early cup of tea,
the ingenious Mr. Baumer secluded himself in
his room at the hotel and set to work upon a
letter. It was addressed to a Mr. Kirkmichael,
wine merchant, of Cheapside, London, E.C.,
and it was of so interesting a nature that it may
well be reproduced here.
? Dear K.? it ran :
?You will instruct our Chief that I have
made important progress. The Prince is actually
at the school at C.P. I have seen him to-day and
recognised him from the photographs. There can
be no mistake. I have exact details of the position
of the buildings and grounds. The young fool
who accompanied me, and who himself was at the
school recently, gave me precise information as to
the rooms occupied by the P. and his tutor. The
question of entrance to the place will present no
difficulty. Kopke made a reconaissance some time
back at night and gave me a plan of the grounds . .
. . .? (From which note it may be gathered that
? Spotty ? Falconer?s ghost-monk scare had some
foundation in fact.?
? The river broadens considerably on the
south side of the bridge. With the ebb tide a boat
would make quick progress to the mouth, or I might
find a car more convenient. Let me have the chief?s


instructions with regard to the yacht, the exact day
and the time it will be standing off, and I will
arrange accordingly.
? Yours faithfully,
Ludwig Baumer.?
? P.S. I leave Dymchester to-morrow night.
Write me the ? Ship Hotel,? Bournewick. Tell the
Chief also that Schwarz has been dismissed. His
clumsy attempt on the P. will have had the effect
of putting the P.?s friends on their guard.?
From the above epistle, it will be gathered by
the discerning reader that matters in relation
to Prince Karl of Altburg were now taking a
serious turn. In due course Mr. Baumer?s let-
ter was forwarded to a certain Archduke resi-
dent in Paris, and certain meetings followed
that presaged no good towards the young Alt-
burgian at Compton Prior School.
What were to be the results of his apparently
harmless association with the ingenuous wine
merchant Harper could not possibly have
dreamed. He went on his way with a careless
mind, while, at the school, none had any
thought of the calamity that was impending.


CHAPTER XIV.
Settling An Account.
?Ssh! you chaps! Stop jabbering!?
The Badger had gathered a dozen of his fol-
lowers together at the back of the fives courts.
?Do you want everyone to know we?re here?
Shut up and I?ll tell you what?s in the wind.?
The company came to attention smartly and
the Badger disclosed his reason for summoning
the meeting.
?You haven?t forgotten, I suppose,? he be-
gan, ?the scare we got in the cellars that night
we met to form the new Society? Well, I had
my suspicions about it and it wasn?t long before
I tumbled to the wheeze. That ghost-voice was
a put-up job. Do you see? We were hoaxed?
fooled. And by whoV ?
The Badger waited in vain for enlighten-
ment. No one, it seemed had any name to offer,
and no one had the temerity to correct his gram-
mar.


?By whoV? proceeded the Karlist chief im-
pressively. ?I will tell you. It was the traitor
Pottle well! ? ?
Exclamations of surprise ran round the
group.
?Yes, that young ass, Potty.? The Badger
dropped into a more colloquial tone. ?He and
Merrick and Johnson ??
At the mention of his name most of those
present turned their eyes upon Merrick who
stood by their leader?s side.
?It?s all right,? explained the Badger.
?Merrick?s one of us now. He?s had a row
with Potty and broken with him. Potty?s a
wrong ?un, isn?t he, Merry??
Merrick nodded and gave his assent.
? ?And he who came to scoff remained to
?play,? ? murmured the Microbe, in paren-
thesis.
?Merrick?s told me how the whole thing was
worked,? added the Badger, ?by speaking
through a pipe that ran between the two cel-
lars. Johnson did the voice, but it was Potty?s
scheme. Now I?ll tell you what we?ve got to
do to get back on him. Will you fellows all
stand in with me??


There was a unanimous agreement, and the
company gathered closer round the Badger
while he outlined the plan that he had formed.
It was certainly a daring plan, but, as detailed
and expounded by its originator, it seemed to
offer very few difficulties. Everyone listened
attentively and everyone bound himself to the
strictest secrecy.
The air of mystery with which the proceed-
ings were conducted was heightened by the
Badger?s concluding remarks.
?Now, how many will you fellows answer
for ?? he asked. ?We shall want about twenty
in all.?
?Two,???Three,???One,???Two.?
The response was ready from several voices.
?A dozen if you want 'em,? said Belton. ?I
know a ripping place for the beggars.?
?That?s all right, then,? said the Badger.
?Merry and I will be here to-morrow evening
at 6.30 sharp. Bring the things along, and
keep ?em dark, mind 1 It?ll ruin the whole
show if anything leaks out! ? ?
After some more conferring the assembly
broke up, leaving the Badger and his new aide
to settle the final details between themselves.


?You're sure you can do the trick, Merry??
asked the former.
?Rather,? was Merrick?s reply. ?I know
when Donaldson will be out of his room and I
can nip in quite safely.?
?And the voice? You?re safe on that??
?As easy as pie. You know Donaldson?s
squeaky pipe. How?s this?? Merrick gave an
instant exhibition of his powers of mimicry,
which left no doubt in his companion?s mind as
to the success of the scheme.
?Jolly good,? said the Badger. ?It?d de-
ceive me.? And higher praise than that he felt
he could not offer.
?Righto, then,? observed Merrick, as they
parted. ?You get Potty along under the win-
dow at the right time and leave the rest to me.?
The second scene in this little drama was set
for six-thirty p.m. on the following evening.
And punctually at that hour, in the shadow of
the wall of the fives court, some seven or eight
members of the Karlist Band produced mys-
terious packages from their pockets and emp-
tied their wriggling contents into a canvas bag
which the Badger held before him. The recep-
tacle being almost full, and no further contri-


butions being forthcoming, it was securely tie
up with string. Then the Badger carried it oft
to a convenient hiding place?to wit, the cel-
lars?until the time came for its immediate use.
?Jolly good wheeze this, of the Badger?s,
said Belton, as he moved away with Pepmg-
ton and Simpson, the three comporting them-
selves like conspirators concerned in another
Gunpowder Plot.
?It serves Potty right,? replied the Gideon
rowing man. � T know I was jolly well scared
that night. Beastly uncanny it sounded, didn?t
it, Peppy??
Pepington chuckled. It 11 make a jolly
good jape, anyway,? he remarked. And it s
about time another one was due. What a lark
it?ll be to-morrow if the thing comes off all
right ? ? ?
Precisely at six-fifteen in the evening of the
next day (it was the Wednesday after the match
against Dymchester) the Badger had a fleeting
word with his lieutenant, Merrick.
?Got it all fixed up, Merry?? he inquired
anxiously.
?Absolutely 0.K.? was the response.
?Donaldson?s in the Masters? Poom, yapping
with Bates and Campion. I?ve made sure and


there?s no risk of his coming back so soon as
this. Prep, doesn?t start till seven you know.
You get hold of Potty and walk him round by
the window at half-past. I?ll be there ready.?
It was precisely as the school clock struck the
half-hour that Pottlewell, lured by a specious
pretext on the part of Simpson (the Badger
thought it discreet not to figure in this special
scene), passed slowly by under the window? a
second-floor window?of the room occupied by
Mr. Donaldson in the Gideon house. The
quadrangle was fortunately empty of other
boys or masters.
The window was open. Suddenly a master?s
head, complete with mortar-board was thrust
out, a fold of his gown fluttering in the light
wind.
Ah, Pottlewell!? came the well-known
squeaky voice. ?Go down to the station will
you. Ask for a parcel for me. Donaldson. Be
quick.?
The head disappeared into the shadow of the
room. Pottlewell stared at the open window.
Did you hear that, Simpson?? he asked.
?Go to the station? Did he mean me??
I heard plain enough,? replied Simpson.


?You?ve got to go to the station for Donaldson,
end get a parcel for him. You heard what he
said. Hadn?t you better cut along??
?I suppose it?s all right,? eaid the mystified
Pottlewell. ??That was Donaldson?s voice,
wasn?t it? He spoke so jolly fast I couldn tbe
sure what he said.
?He said c go down to the station and get a
parcel for me!? And ?be quick,? he said.? Simp-
son repeated the order given. ??You ought to
be back just in time for prep. I?d cut along
right away, if I were you.?
Properly impressed by his companion s insis-
tence, Pottlewell stood no longer upon the order
of his going. He went at once. Behold him,
then, after assuring the school porter of the ur-
gency of his mission, trudging along the road
to the station.
Having arrived at his destination, he sought
the parcels office, but to his dismay this was
closed. There was a porter, however, by the
booking-office and to him Pottlewell explained
the situation. There was a parcel expected for
Mr. Donaldson of the school. Had it arrived
yet?
A parcel? The porter took off his hat and


scratched his head. Well, come to think of it
he believed as there was a ?passel? for someone
up at the school. If the young gentleman ?ud
wait a minute he?d look an? see. And sure
enough, a parcel there was; a canvas bag, tied at
the top with string and duly labelled ?A.
Donaldson, Esq., Compton Prior School.?
Pottlewell grasped the bag by its loose top
and, thanking the porter for his good offices
set off up the road in high spirits. By not hur-
rying unduly he might escape a good ten minutes
of prep., and as Mr. Donaldson happened to be
t e master on duty that evening no explanations
as to his lateness would be necessary.
Joe Raggett, the porter watched the retreat-
ing figure with interest.
c ?That?s the easiest two shillun? I?ve ever
earned !? said he with a chuckle. ? Tassel for
master up at the school,? says he. Wonder what
y y oun f> rascals be up to this afternoon.
Passel ?ull be called for this evenin? ? says they.
Bit o? mischief, I rackon!? He chuckled again
and disappeared into the porters? room upon his
business.
Without any difficulty, Pottlewell timed his
appearance at the school gates to synchronise


with the first quarter after seven o?clock. As
Mr. Donaldson would be in Big Hall he decided
to take the parcel to him direct. He had not
been instructed to convey it to the master?s
room.
The stir that Pottlewell?s entrance into the
hall made would have embarrassed anyone of
less nerve than the Third-Former possessed.
Ignoring the many glances directed towards
him, and the whispers that caught his ear, he
marched up the centre aisle towards the mas-
ter?s desk.
Mr. Donaldson, a thin, spectacled man, with
a nervous, hesitating manner, eyed the advanc-
ing boy with astonishment.
?What does this mean, Pottlewell?? he de-
manded in his shrill voice. ?You are a quarter
of an hour late. Where have you been ??
?Your parcel, sir,? explained Pottlewell.
holding up the canvas bag for inspection. ?I
fetched it from the station, as you told me,
sir.?
?My parcel? What do you mean, Pottle-
well?? Mr. Donaldson glared at the boy
through his spectacles. ?The station? Ido
not understand you.?
Pottlewell shifted about uneasily on one foot.


?Yes. sir; a little more than half an hour ago.
You called to me from your window, sir, and
tol me to go to the station to fetch a parcel for
you.
The unhappy boy?s voice faltered. The mas-
ter?s undisguised amazement led him to think
that some ghastly mistake had occurred. Had
he been dreaming, or had Mr. Donaldson really
spoken to him ? It is to his credit that, with his
first suspicion of something having gone wrong,
he did not mention Simpson?s name.
?This is preposterous!? Mr. Donaldson?s
voice rose to a higher pitch, and certain of the
junior school undergoing preparation waited
expectantly for the explosion. ?You juust be
out of your senses, boy! I never sent you to the
station for any parcel! Is this a joke on your
part, Pottle well ? If so, it is ill-timed.
?No, sir?l fetched the parcel. I?it?s no
joke, sir, I assure you.?
PottlewelTs face had grown pale under the
steady glare from those spectacles.
?Open the bag?open it at once!? Mr. Don-
aldson commanded. And Pottlewell, produc-
ing a penknife, slit the string. As he did so,
the bag being held at a convenient angle, some


ten or more frogs fell out on to the floor, where
they hopped agilely under the desks.
?What on earth?? Frogs \? exclaimed the
master. ?Pottlewell! Frogs \ Pick them up
at onceV ?
The gasp that ran round the schoolroom
combined astonishment and joy very discreetly.
Then someone gave a titter, and the back
benches let themselves go unrestrainedly. Mr.
Donaldson raised a protesting hand in vain.
Pottlewell meanwhile had dropped the bag as
though it were a hot cinder, thereby releasing
more of its contents, and now went down upon
all-fours to re-capture the batrachians. The
occupants of the front rows of desks gleefully
assisted him, and such a chase ensued as Even-
ing Preparation at Compton Prior had never
before witnessed. If Mr. Donaldson?s stern-
ness of manner had subsided somewhat, and the
steely glare of his eyes had softened, there is lit-
tle wonder. Pottlewell?s attitude was not that
of one guilty of a practical joke. The master
divined some other agency at work in the back-
ground, but he bided his time.
After several minutes of wild scrambling
about on the floor the errant frogs were re-


captured and restored to the bag. Having sat-
isfied himself that none had escaped observa-
tion, Mr. Donaldson bade the unhappy and
mystified Pottlewell take the bag to the porter
and order him to discharge its contents imme-
diately.
?You will then return at once to Prepara-
tion,? he instructed, ?and will remain behind
after the others have been dismissed to make up
the lost fifteen minutes. Afterwards I will see
you about this most extraordinary affair. Now
then, silence, please!? he continued. ?Every-
one will go on with his work. No talking there,
Badgerley. We have wasted enough time, as
it is.?
The Preparation students bent their heads
over their books again and silence reigned in
the Big Hall. Despite the master?s prohibi-
tion, however, the Badger managed to whisper
into the ear of Merrick, who occupied the desk
in front of him.
?It came off, Merry! Poor old Potty! What
a jape!?
Merrick kicked a foot back in acknowledg-
ment and smothered a chuckle in a cough.
It had, indeed, been a success. The picture


of Pottlewell emptying the bag of frogs was
one to remember all one?s life. The Badger
had risen to the occasion this time. It was the
best joke?for years. Merrick was about to
chuckle again when there passed across his
mind a thought as to the sequel. How was
Donaldson going to take it ? And would Potty
and Simpson be compelled to give him and the
Badger away?
Fortunately for his peace of mind, Mr. Don-
aldson eventually decided to make light of the
incident. In the Masters? Boom the story of
Pottlewell and the frogs was hailed as a great
joke.
?My dear fellow,? said the Rev. Septimus,
don't go and spoil it by making a fuss. That
young Pottlewell has had his knife into some-
one and they?ve very ingeniously got their own
back. Leave it alone, I say. He?ll get his
punishment in the ridicule it will bring him.?
Mr. Donaldson?s other colleagues were dis-
posed to be of the same opinion, and the master
wisely consented to let the matter rest.
It was a piece of impudence, without a
doubt,? he said, k ?and I?d very much like to
know who it was succeeded in impersonating


me so successfully, and how it was done. But
Master Pottlewell fully deserves being made
a fool. You remember I told you how be played
the part of the fortune-teller at Westbam
Fair? It?s probable that that little business has
prompted some enemy to lay this trap for
him. Pride comes before a fall, truly; Pottle-
well had his fun, and is now paying for it!?
That the Third-Former was indeed paying
for his fun was evident when, on being released
from Prep., he made his appearance in the
Den. It was a somewhat chastened Pottle-
well who entered the Common Boom, but never-
theless a Pottlewell bent on vengeance.
?Hello, Froggy?? queried a voice. And
from other quarters of the room there came the
unmistakable sounds of croaking. On a chair
in a corner little Benham, who added vocal
gifts to his skill as a cox, was singing lustily
?Froggy would a-wooing go!?
?All right, you chaps,? announced Pottle-
well in an injured tone . ?I understand. But
I?ll find out who put up this wheeze on me,
and I?ll??
What he was prepared to do, Pottlewell was
unable to declare, for at that moment there
came a sepulchral voice from the back :


c ?Begone Ye Sorry Fools, and Vex Not
Our Troubled Souls.?
This was the signal for a howl of delight.
In another minute the Den had become Pan-
demonium again. Pottlewell, plunging at the
nearest of his tormenters, made a wild and in-
effectual attack. He was at once besieged on
all sides, and was presently borne to the
ground, panting, dishevelled and humbled.
?Pax!? he cried, with all the voice that he
could command in the circumstances, there be-
ing no fewer than six juniors atop of him.
?Pax! 1 give in I?
?Says he?s sorry, Badger,? proclaimed one
of the triumphant six.
?All right,? said the Badger magnani-
mously. ?Let him up.?
Pottlewell was assisted to his feet, and the
Badger announced on behalf of the Karlists
that they would now consider themselves
?quits.? The joke played upon them in the
cellars had been avenged. Payment had been
made in full. The members of the Society were
satisfied.
There was nothing to be done but to make
the best of the situation, and this Pottlewell


did. With as good a grace as possible he ad-
mitted the authorship of the ?ghost jape,?
and was not a little flattered to discover how
successful it had been. As he had now been the
principal agent in another and equally success-
ful practical joke he was finally accepted as a
good fellow, a man and a brother.
With this pleasant conclusion to an eventful
evening the occupants of the Den betook them-
selves a little later to their respective dor-
mitories.
Pottlewell?s chief cause for congratulation,
however, was Mr. Donaldson?s obvious inten-
tion to ignore the frog incident. The Third-
ly ormer heard nothing more officially about the
matter, but it is worthy of record that from
that day onward he was known throughout the
school as ?Froggy? Pottlewell.


CHAPTER XV.
The Archduke Strikes.
Mid-term came and the sunny June weather
promised to hold fine for the annual holiday.
According to long-established custom those
boys who had relations and friends within easy
distance were permitted to pay them a visit.
Some of the seniors were allowed to go to Dym-
chester, Cop wick among them; many others
preferred to spend the day at Bournewick,
where bathing and other delights offered them-
selves.
The mid-term holiday fell upon a Wednes-
day. Among the seniors Lorrimer, Wenham
and Karl resolved upon Bournewick as their
objective, the prospect of a sea-dip and a long
walk along the cliffs making a strong appeal
to them. Hearing from Karl of this arrange-
ment, Mr. Campion expressed his desire to ac-


company them, for part of the time at least.
It is possible that the house-master had some
sense of danger in the air. The long silence
that had elapsed since the first blow had been
struck by the Archduke puzzled him and filled
him with concern. It seemed ominous and he
was more than ever perturbed.
Starting soon after breakfast, the Bourne-
wick party set off in high spirits. The sea
looked inviting and it was not long before the
boys and their master were enjoying a swim.
In a little while a number of the juniors, par-
ticularly those of the Karlist band, followed
their example. The Badger had agreed that
the members of the Society should spend their
day at the seaside resort. His idea, however,
of carrying out the special duties for which the
band was formed was knocked on the head
promptly by the majority.
?Jolly lot of fun all keeping together, I
think !? snorted O?Donell. ?I'm going to have
another look at those smugglers? caves under
the cliffs.?
?There?s some ripping roundabouts by the
pier, said another. ?Only twopence a time.
t Vote we go there.?


The Band quickly broke up into parties, and
the Badger found himself left to the company of
the faithful Microbe, Falconer and another.
It may be noted here, in passing, that the
projected opposition to the Karlists had come
to naught. With the departure of Shotter,
whom he had fixed upon as chief supporter,
Pottlewell let the scheme drop. Hence, the
Badger and his associates had had a clear field
before them.
?Let His Serene Highness play with his kids,
if he likes to,? Pottlewell had said to Merrick
and Johnson, who broached the question of rag-
ging the new Society. ?Shotter?s gone, and
Mabberley?s no good now since the bust-up.
Let ?em mess about as they please; I?m not
going to worry.?
After lunch had been disposed of, Mr. Cam-
pion suggested a walk along the cliffs to the
neighbouring village of Fishbourne. This was
in accordance with their original plans, so the
quartet took the road with every anticipation
of a delightful jaunt.
And delightful the walk proved to be. In
the summer sun, with a light breeze blowing
from the land, the country around them looked


its best. The grass was thick and luscious,
there was a variety of wild-flowers at their
feet, while the tang of salt in the air added a
zest to the outing. In the distance were the
low rolling Downs, with their patchwork of
cultivated portions and, in some instances, with
their odd-looking caps of trees. Out at sea
were a few fishing-craft and rowing boats; on
the horizon they saw the white sails of a yacht
which was standing up-Channel.
A fifth member of the party, though he was
not properly considered as being included, was
Karl?s servant, Franz. The man had insisted
on accompanying his master to the coast town,
though Karl had derided the necessity for his
attendance. Franz and Mr. Campion had ex-
changed some conversation on their arrival,
the house-master being able to speak suffic-
ient of the native tongue, and the servant was
obviously pleased at being allowed to join them.
He still wore the foreign-looking cap with the
hard leather peak, to the delight of the juniors
who saw possibilities of fresh fun in prospect.
Nothing of incident occurred during the ram-
ble, except for the passing of a newly-painted
blue motor car which was heading for Bourne-


wick. As it tore past them along the cliff road
Mr. Campion gave a fleeting glance at its oc-
cupant. The man?s face seemed familiar to
him, and suddenly he recollected the car with
a man and a boy in it that had gone by the
school some weeks before. Was it the same
car? Was it the same man? He could not be
sure, but the impression remained upon his
mind and kept him thoughtful during the
greater part of the walk.
The four friends joked and chatted as only
schoolboys can who are out for a holiday.
Work was behind them for the time; the day
was their?s to enjoy to the full. There was no
lingering fear, in the minds of three of them at
least, that anything could arise to mar their
pleasure. Not even the sight of those white
sails some miles away at sea brought any fore-
boding to them of evil to come. All Nature
was bright and gay and invited them to be of
the same mood.
They reached Fishbourne in due time, ex-
plored its miniature bay, partook of tea at a
pretty, flower-bedecked cottage in a hollow,
and then retraced their steps. At intervals, to
Karl?s amusement, they had glimpses of the


Badger and his allies scampering like rabbits
up and down the cliffs. To von Altburg the
peculiar attachment of his admirer was a source
of mirth. He had become accustomed now to
the kind of dog-like fidelity which the Badger
now offered him.
Then evening came and the happy pleasure-
seekers made their way to the railway station
for the homeward journey. The mid-term
holiday had come to its end, but there was no
question of its complete success. The sea, the
caves, the roundabouts, the pier and other at-
tractions had been fully patronised. A very
tired but contented party returned to Compton
Prior to compare notes with their fellows who
had gone elsewhere.
To Wenham?s surprise he found a visitor
awaiting him at the school. Allison, of the
?Record,? ignorant of the holiday arrangements,
had made the journey from London specially
to see him. The reporter announced that he
was putting up at the inn in the village. He
had already made himself known to the Head,
and was given permission to visit Wenham in
his study or carry him off to the village if
desired.


Toby pronounced for a ?brew? in bis study,
and decided that not only Karl but Lorrimer
should join him. A little later, therefore,
Allison found himself face to face with the boy
whom everyone at Compton Prior apparently
accepted as Prince Karl of Altburg. His first
impression was favourable. The boy was well-
built, though a little on the slight side; he car-
ried himself with a confident, manly air, and
Allison liked the straightforward, honest look
in the blue eyes. Yes, Prince or no Prince, he
was distinctly a likeable fellow.
It was not the moment for prying and possi-
bly impertinent questions. Allison did his
best to make himself agreeable. He told stor-
ies, spoke about newspaper work, its ups and
downs, about his missions abroad, and so on,
and succeeded in interesting the boys. When
he said ?good-night? at last it was with a
promise that they should see him again on the
morrow. To Toby he whispered that they
might find opportunity for a serious talk;
there was much he wanted to learn.
?Real good chap, that reporter pal of
yours,? observed Lorrimer. ?What an amus-


ing talker he is. Seems to have been to so many
places and done such a lot of things.?
?All in the day?s work,? Toby returned, the
hope rising in his mind that it would not be
long ere he himself would be moving in the same
wonderful world of newspaper life.
?What?s he doing up here? On a stunt of
some kind, or merely taking a holiday?? con-
tinued the Captain.
But Toby parried the question, and Lorri-
mer, who suddenly recollected the letter from
Mr. Wenham ?the letter which had so much
perturbed them?changed the subject abruptly.
He chaffed Karl lightly about a race they had
had in the water at Bournewick, and after this
interlude they parted company.
The first intimation that anything was amiss
at Compton Prior that night was received from
Richardson, the house-prefect at Campion?s.
When he entered the house-master?s room, in
response to a drowsy ?Come in!? following
upon his knock, he announced that Karl von
Altburg had not shown up in the dormitory.
Richardson had been to the boy?s study, think-
ing that he had been working late there and
probably fallen asleep over his books, and had


found the room empty. Nor was he to be dis-
covered in any of the other studies.
Mr. Campion jumped out of bed and hastily
dressed. As he flung on his clothes he ques-
tioned Richardson rapidly. The prefect de-
clared that there was no sign of disorder in
Karl?s study. Everything was in place, just
as he had left it presumably after finishing his
reading. The only thing to be noted was that
the window was standing open.
The house-master gave an exclamation at
this. The fear that had been growing in his
mind seemed to be becoming stronger.
?Come,? he said curtly to the prefect. ?ITI
just make certain that von Altburg is not in the
house. Then we?ll try the Schoolhouse, and
acquaint Dr. Atterbury with the news.?
He said nothing more, but hurried off with
Richardson to make the round of the studies
and dormitories. The search proved fruitless.
Hastening to the Schoolhouse, where it was just
possible that Karl was having a late sitting
with his friend Lorrimer, Mr. Campion dis-
covered that the School Captain was already in
bed. Neither he nor Wenham had seen any-


thing of their chum since they had said good-
night.
This intelligence made it clear to the house-
master that something alarming had occurred.
Dr. Atterbury was at once aroused, and, to-
gether with Eichardson, and Lorrimer and
Wenham, who had at once dressed themselves,
the two masters set about investigating the
mystery.
The open window in KarTs study seemed to
suggest a solution. If the boy had voluntarily
left the house, or had been spirited away
thence, he had evidently gone by the window.
In a hurried whisper to the Head, Mr. Campion
communicated his fears. The worst must have
happened. Karl?s enemies, of whom Dr.
Atterbury had fairly complete knowledge, had
struck their final blow. By some extraordin-
ary means they had entered the school, caught
the boy unawares, and had smuggled him out-
side.
Whither? That was the question. The
search-party went into the grounds to look for
anything that might give some indication. The
moonlight was sufficiently strong to show foot-
prints on the flower-beds ?footprints of whom


it was impossible to say. On the gravelled path
near to the wall and immediately below the win-
dow was the dead stump of a cigar. As his eye
fell upon this Mr. Campion?s heart sank. Why
did this harmless-looking object fill him with
a sense of dread ? Why should his mind revert
immediately to the blue-painted car that had
visited the school weeks earlier, to the big,
heavily-built man sitting therein, the man
wdiom he had seen smoking a large cigar ?
From the school grounds they made their way
to the village. There were enquiries to be made
without delay; the police must be informed.
At the inn Allison was awakened, Toby hav-
ing explained to Mr. Campion the reason for
the reporter?s presence there. Franz, too,
awakened by the unusual bustle, came down
from his room to learn the news.
The village policeman, patrolling the street
some little distance from the hostelrv was
*7
quickly questioned. No, he had heard nothing
to cause any alarm. Things had been quiet, as
usual, in the place. He had been round by the
school earlier, but had noticed nothing sus-
picious; had only passed two or three people, all
of whom he knew. Now they had mentioned


it, however, he had heard a motor-car pass
pretty close by ?half an hour or more agone,
perhaps; car had gone off towards Bournewick,
he fancied. He could add nothing further.
At the small police station the telephone was
put in action. The police at Dymchester, at
Bournewick and elsewhere were promptly noti-
fied of the mysterious disappearance and were
requested to keep observation on all motor-
cars entering those places.
That done, Mr. Campion ordered the car
that was kept in the garage at the Priory Inn
to be got ready at once. While he paced up
and down outside, chafing at the seemingly
long delay, he reproached himself for not hav-
ing listened before to the warning voice that
had sounded in his ears. The sense of some im-
pending disaster had been present with him
ever since their walk across the cliffs; had he
been more attentive to its significance, more
vigilant in his care for the boy, this dreadful
thing could not have happened.
But reproaches, he told himself, were use-
less. The call now was for action. The soldier
in him awoke, and he gave his orders with a
clear head. Lorrimer and Richardson were


to accompany him to Bournewick; Wenham
was to remain with Mr. Allison at the station
to be ready to take any ?phone message that
might come and communicate immediately
with Dr. Atterbury, who had now returned
to the school. It was quite probable that the
police at one or other town would have some
tidings of the wanted car.
Within half an hour of the alarm having
been given Mr. Campion, Lorrimer and Rich-
ardson were speeding southward to the sea-
side resort. Bournewick, as they ran through its
narrow thoroughfares, was apparently deserted.
They encountered no one in the empty streets,
with the exception of a belated reveller from
some inn on the front. On the Parade the
electric lights had been turned off; the place
was in darkness.
A policeman, gathered in by the pier, had
the first important intelligence to impart. A
motor-car ?couldn?t say whether it was blue
or black, for that matter?had come into the
town best part of an hour before. It had passed
him close here by the pier and had then gone
on towards the quay at the eastern end. No, he
couldn?t say exactly how many was in the car :


two or three, p?raps : didn?t take parti?clar
notice. (Was mentally dubbed a fool by Mr.
Campion and dismissed from the enquiry.)
To the quayside was the next order. Here
news came fast enough. Harry Holders,
bathing machine and boat proprietor, had had
a call that night for his motor launch. Party
in a motor-car, a large one ?motor-car he
meant ?had come down in a hurry, wanting
to be taken off to a yacht lying at anchor some
little ways off. Party comprised two gentle-
men?thought as they were gentlemen, any-
way, the big one paid handsomely enough
for the trip!?an? a young gentleman
what seemed to be ill. One of the others had to
help him out of the car and into the boat. No,
the young gentleman had no cap on; just
dressed in his ordinary clothes, like they was.
He never spoke no word; just did what they
told ?im.
That was all really, excep? that the two gen-
tlemen spoke to each other in some furrin lang-
widge. Not that they couldn?t speak English
?leastways, one of ?em did. Yes, he brought
one of the gentlemen back to the quay ?the
big chap, it was. He drove off again in his


motor-car. Didn?t know as he was doing any
thin? wrong in taking of ?em off, added Mr.
Holders; hoped as there was nothing serious
amiss, he did.
So far, then, success; so far, failure. It was
as clear as daylight that Karl?s enemies?the
enemies of Altburg?had succeeded only too
well in their plans. Karl had been trapped,
had been carried away from beneath their
very noses, and was now a prisoner on a boat
somewhere far out at sea.
Mr. Campion and the two boys stood by the
motor-car while the boatman retailed all that he
knew. They said nothing to each other, but
stared silently out across the dark water.
Somewhere out there was Karl! The sea and
the darkness had swallowed him up, and God
alone knew what fate was in store for the un-
happy boy!


CHAPTER XVI.
On Board the ?Christina.?
What next to do ? So far the chase had been
in vain; if Karl had been carried off in the
yacht ?and that seemed most conclusive ?they
had no idea of his destination. Mr. Campion
realised that the Archduke had scored in the
latest move of the game, though he felt some
inward satisfaction at the surprise that was in
store for that unscrupulous plotter. The im-
mediate question was : whither were his ene-
mies taking Karl? To France? Or to Russia?
And what chance had he or any of the boy?s
friends of picking up the trail ?
Bundling his companions into the car, the
house-master drove off now to the local police
station. He wanted to get on the ?phone to
Compton Prior and find out if anything had


transpired. Allison was at the other end and
had important tidings to impart. Having just
learned the news of Karl?s kidnapping on the
yacht, he spoke rapidly and to the point.
?I?ve been on to the ?Record? office,? he
said, ?and I?m going to take a hand in this
right away. It?s my story now. Hang on at
Bournewick until I come down. I?m leaving
here at once. We?ve got to get a fast boat and
take up the chase. I?ve good reason to
believe the yacht will make for France.
The Archduke has been in Paris; we found out
his whereabouts and one of our men was told
off to keep an eye on the old fox. It?s the best
chance to follow him there. This is a scoop
for me, Campion. We?ve got the main facts
of the revolutionary plot all ready to disclose,
and this story of kidnapping the Prince will be
a big splash for us. Hold on till I come and
find out about a fast motor boat. So long.?
A short time afterwards, Allison, the man
Franz with him, drove into the town, having
commandeered a car from the doctor at Comp-
ton Prior. He found the somewhat dejected
search-party by the pier entrance. Mr. Cam-
pion announced that he had made enquiries and


had secured a motor launch?the fastest on the
beach?from a friend of Mr. Bolders.
?Good!? said Allison. The reporter was
now in his element. He was on the track of
a big story; the hunt was up; already the head-
lines to his ?splash? were taking shape in his
brain. ?Let?s go right along,? he continued,
?and get busy. I propose that you, Campion,
Franz and Igo off in the boat. Franz will be
useful, knowing the blighters? language better
than you or I do. The boys can return to the
school in your car. By the way,? he added,
turning to Lorrimer, ?you?ll find young Toby
Wenham eating his heart out with disappoint-
ment. It was all I could do to stop him jump-
ing into the bus as I came away! Cheer him
up, will you ??
Lorrimer smiled and promised to do his best.
Then he and Richardson got into the Compton
Prior car, \and the innkeeper?s son, who had
driven them down, swung the Ford into the
home road.
On the way to the quayside, Allison formu-
lated his plans to Mr. Campion. There was
little likelihood of their overhauling the Arch-
duke?s yacht before she got to a French port?
Boulogne, say. His intention was to proceed


to Paris directly they landed, to get in touch
with his agent there. They must trust to luck
to pick up a clue at the Archduke?s residence.
He told his companions how successful he had
been in unravelling the plot aimed against Alt-
burg. Russia was behind it, of course. The
train had been skillfully laid for a rising in the
capital; German members of the Communist
party were ready to aid in the couy , and the
kidnapping of the Prince was to be followed
by the capture of the Palace at Cheritza and the
forced abdication of the Princess-Regent.
While the full particulars of the plot were now
in the possession of the ?Record.? steps were
already being taken to arrest certain of the
ringleaders in the affair.
?Tell me one thing, Campion,? said the re-
porter, breaking off suddenly. ?This von Alt-
burg ?this Karl friend of yours?he isn?t the
real Prince, is he ??
?No,? answered Mr. Campion. ?He is
not.?
Allison nodded. ?I thought so,? he said.
?I had pretty reliable knowledge that the real
chap was knocking about the Italian coast.
Travelling incog., I knew, but he was well
identified. This Karl of yours, then ??


?One of the finest fellows I have ever
known,? returned the other, ?and the plucki-
est. He is?good heavens ! What?s that??
The two were now almost at the quayside.
From out at sea there came a dull boom. Then
a rocket flew up into the sky and burst into a
flame.
?That's from the lightship,? remarked Mr.
Campion. ?Come on, we must find out what?s
happening!?
They jumped out of the doctor?s car, followed
by Franz, and hurried down to the front, where
several boatmen were already gathered. Others
joined the group soon afterwards. The news
quickly spread from mouth to mouth. Some
vessel had grounded on the Counter Sands.
It was a signal to the Bournewick lifeboat
station. The lifeboat itself, a motor craft, was
now being run out and they watched it race
away across the water.
A sudden hope sprang up in Mr. Campion?s
mind. Was the hand of Providence at work
to arrest the guilty at the very moment of his
seeming triumph? Was their quest about to
end in success, after all? A prayer that it
might be the Christina that was in difficulties
rose to his lips.


Allison, meanwhile, busied himself looking for
Mr. Holders? mate and the motor launch that
had been requisitioned. He returned to his com-
panion?s side some minutes later to say that
the boat had been found and would soon be
ready to start.
?It?ll cost a tidy bit of money,? he remarked.
But the ?Eecord? stands for all that. Thank
goodness, the Chief doesn t kick at the price
when there's a scoop in the offing!?
Mr. Campion, however, was disposed to wait
a little longer, until the return of the lifeboat-
men. Something in him urged him to learn
their news before starting. He told himself
that every moment was precious, that any delay
might be fatal to the success of their journey;
but still that inner voice kept demanding
?Wait! Wait!?
After what seemed to be an unconscionable
time the lifeboat returned. It was a pleasure
boat on the Counter, a small yacht ?the Christ-
ina, from Havre. The tidings swiftly passed
round. She was in no danger. She had nosed
her way gently into the sands and stuck there.
With the turn of the tide ?in another hour,
probably?she could work herself off with her
auxiliary motor.


The lifeboatmen dispersed, their craft being
hauled back into the shed, and there remained
only the watchers on the quay. Mr. Campion
gave a sigh of thankfulness. ?I was right,?
he muttered to himself. ?The hand of Provi-
dence! Thank God we may be in time!?
Allison was overjoyed at the intelligence.
Things were undoubtedly coming his way.
Here was the Christina with, presumably, the
Archduke and Karl on board, hard and fast
on the Counter. They had a speedy motor
launch ready, and there was nothing to do but
to push off and beard the lion in his den.
? Got him! Campion! ? he chuckled.
?What a scoop for the ?Record!?
Within a few minutes the three were afloat,
with Holders and his mate, Merrifield by name,
in the stern, heading for the stranded vessel.
Franz crouched in the bows, one hand in a
pocket of his coat gripping something tightly
as he peered through the upflung spray into the
darkness.
They passed the lightship on the port quarter
and bore away westward to the Counter Sands.
The thin fog began to lift, fortunately, with
the breeze that had sprung up, and presently


they could discern the yacht as she lay with a
slight list on the edge of the shoal. Nearby
there came to them the dull sound of a bell
from a buoy that tossed restlessly upon the
water.
The two boatmen ran the launch skillfully
along the Christina under her lee, one of them
clutching at a rope that trailed down the ves-
sel?s side. A face looked down at them over
the rail and a hoarse voice shouted something.
None of the occupants of the launch took any
notice. Then Franz, standing on the thwart,
gave a spring. He caught the rail and pulled
himself on board. Allison followed next, giv-
ing a hand to Campion to assist him on deck.
By this time the sailor who had witnessed
their approach had shouted to others on board
the yacht and several figures appeared up the
companion way. Franz was already volubly
demanding something of these, and Mr. Cam-
pion caught the word '?Prinz? more than once.
A moment later, the captain of the yacht, bare-
headed and in a brass-buttoned reefer jacket,
made his appearance. To his curt question as
to their presence there Mr. Campion replied
by asking if the Archduke Otto were on board.
The man grunted an assent and pointed below.


Allison understood the gesture, though he
could not follow the dialogue. He brushed the
captain aside unceremoniously and sprang
down the companion. Franz was close upon
him, and Mr. Campion, the captain making
no remonstrance, stepped after them.
In the saloon cabin the Archduke Otto sat,
with the remains of a meal spread on the table
before him. An oil lamp swung from the
beams. Karl, still very white and ill-looking,
sat on a locker upon the other side, leaning his
head against the panelling. His eyes were
half-closed.
When the raiding-party burst open the door
and entered the cabin the Archduke gave a
gasp of surprise. A short, very fat man, with
large moustache up-curled at the ends, he was
not an impressive personage. His little pig-like
eyes gleamed angrily at the intruders. Then
he burst into a torrent of words.
What followed was the work of seconds.
Franz leapt to Karl?s side with an exclamation,
and kissed the boy?s hand with fervour. Then
he turned suddenly to the Archduke, who re-
mained seated, and drew out a revolver from
his pocket. Only Mr. Campion, in addition to


the Archduke himself, understood the words
the man hurled at the latter.
The Archduke paled. His beady eyes seemed
to recede farther and farther into his head,
His hand went suddenly to a drawer in the
table and the barrel of a revolver gleamed in
the lamplight.
?Put that down, Franz!? ordered Mr. Cam-
pion sharply. At the same instant he made a
grab at the weapon in the Archduke?s hand
and wrested it from his grasp. Very sullenly
Franz let his hand fall; he muttered impreca-
tions under his breath.
Allison took in the situation! ?Smartly
done, Campion, ?? he observed. ?We don?t want
any pirate business. Just tell the Archduke
?that?s him, right enough?to keep still and
listen. We?ll do the talking?or rather, you
will. I can?t jabber their lingo. Do you see
Karl?? he added quickly. ?Doped! That?s
how they got him away so easily. He?s getting
over it, however, and we?ll soon pull him
round.?
With Franz at the cabin door, revolver in
hand, to keep away any intruder, Mr. Campion
and the reporter opened their attack. Speaking
in French, in which he was more fluent, the


master quickly gave the Archduke to under-
stand that they held the whiphand. Although
they were on his yacht and he had Karl appar-
ently in his power, they were there to dictate
terms to him. In short, the game was up. He
was told, with Allison?s prompting, that his
plans had been discovered and frustrated; that
certain documents were even then in the pos-
session of the authorities; and that steps would
be taken to secure his arrest. He would be ar-
raigned on the charge of complicity in the Bol-
shevik plot and that of kidnapping. The whole
story would be given to the world the next day.
The Archduke Otto swore and raved in vain,
while his eyes became two pin-points. The two
Englishmen seated on the opposite side of the
cabin table regarded him without emotion.
Allison?s mind was working quickly on the out-
line of his story for the ?Record,? for the des-
patch of which he was becoming impatient. To
Mr. Campion the question was: how to get
Karl and his captor off the boat in the face
of expected opposition from the yacht?s crew.
He put this to the Archduke point blank, de-
manding his immediate return with the boy to
Bournewick. But the discomfited and angry
arch-plotter protested with many oaths that he


would not assent to any such course. He would
carry them all with him to France, let come
what might. He was furious with the know-
ledge that his schemes had miscarried, that the
captive brought to him was not the actual
Prince, as he had at once discovered; furious
that he should have been so fooled by his agent
was obvious in the malevolent look he cast at
truth of Campion?s statements, disbelieving
Karl. But even now he was dubious as to the
Baumer. His chagrin at this colossal blunder
that treachery had been at work. He was like
a trapped wild beast, ready to turn upon his
captors and rend them.
His little eyes roved from side to side, now
searching their faces, now glancing at Karl,
who still leant wearily, as if half asleep,
against the panelled wall. He snarled and
spat out words in his Magyar tongue that
sounded venomous. Occasionally Franz turned
and shot a glance of malignity at him; but the
man never moved from his station.
So far there had been no interruption from
the captain or any of his crew. Now there came
a sharp knock at the door.
Tell your men to keep away!? ordered Mr.
Campion. ?You understand? We are taking


no chances. If need be, I shall shoot!? He
held the Archduke?s weapon menacingly.
The Christina's owner shouted out a com-
mand in response to the knock, and they heard
the steps of the man outside as he went back
up the companion.
It took but a few minutes longer to appar-
ently convince the Archduke of the futility of
resistance. He shrugged his shoulders, threw
out his hands, spat vehemently on the floor,
and said ?As you will, gentlemen !? The game
was up ? Very well, then; surrender.
?You will return with us at once,? explained
Mr. Campion. ?Allison, see to Karl and bring
him along, will you? We don?t want to waste
time. Quickly!?
With the Archduke before him, and the re-
porter following with his arm round Karl, Mr.
Campion quitted the cabin. Franz was the last
to leave.
They gained the deck, where the members of
the crew were assembled in a group, their faces
showing their bewilderment.
?Give your orders to the captain.? Mr.
Campion?s tone was peremptory. ?He can
?He can
bring the yacht back into the harbour if you
like, when she works off the sand.?


As he spoke the vessel lifted to the swell; it
was evident that her period of imprisonment
was nearly over.
The Archduke hesitated a moment. Then
he sprang forward and cried out something
that was unintelligible to all but the Captain.
The latter sprang quickly into action. He
made a spring at Mr. Campion and clutched the
master round the waist, prisoning his arms. At
the same time a sailor threw himself upon
Franz and fell with him to the deck where the
two lay struggling fiercely.
?To the boat, Allison!? Mr. Campion
shouted. ?Get Karl away! Quick! Never
mind us! ?
Allison, without further ado, seized the boy
by the arm and hurried to the side. The Chris-
tina was now tugging at the sands with the
force of the tide, straining to free herself. As
quickly as he could, the reporter pulled Karl
with him on the rail, calling out to the two
boatmen below to stand by. But the other sail-
ors were on him before he could effect his pur-
pose.
Karl was held back by strong hands, and in
his weak state was unable to offer any resis-
tance.


Then, in a few moments, the worst hap-
pened. The tables had been turned upon them.
Allison, struck at savagely as he clung with his
hands to the side of the craft, fell backwards
into the waiting launch. Mr. Bolders helped to
break his fall to his own discomfort. One of
the Christina?s crew, leaning over, cast off the
rope by which the motor launch had made fast,
and almost simultaneously with this the yacht
heaved herself free from the sands and slid back
into open water.
From the launch, where he sat a little dazed
with his fall, Allison saw the Christina s sails
run up again and heard the shouts on board as
the vessel pulled away from him. Of Campion,
Franz or Karl there was no sight. They had
evidently been hurried below.
To his dismay he now saw the sea mist rol-
ling up again. He turned rapidly to the boat-
men.
?Follow the yacht! At all costs, keep her in
view! ? 5
But the order was more easily given than
followed. By the time the motor had been set
working again, the Christina had disappeared
into a veil of fog. Mr. Bolders grunted and
spat over the boat?s side viciously.


?Put your helm over, Jim,? he cried to Mer-
rifield. The launch swung round and faced the
seas which were now racing across the sands
with some violence as the tide rose.
Allison strained his eyes into the wall of
darkness before him.
?Get her going I Get her going , will you!?
His voice was hoarse with excitement and
damp.
Mr. Holders spat again over the side. ?WeTl
do the best we can, master,? he muttered; ?but
it?s a bit of a needle and haystack game, this !?
For what seemed an intolerable time the
motor launch cruised round, searching here and
there for some glimpse of the Christina. But
the yacht held on her unseen course. The re-
porter strained his ears in vain; not a sound
came to him through the sea-fog.
Half an hour?s vague questing decided the
boatmen that they were on a wild-goose chase-
Despite Allison?s expostulations they turned
the launch shorewards, having picked up the
lightship and got their bearings. And ere long
the reporter, cursing the ill-luck that had be-
fallen him, was landed on Bournewick beach
to carry back with him the tidings of this fresh
disaster.


CHAPTER XVII.
The Events of a Night.
On the Christina, as she plunged through the
seas, the confusion consequent on the recap-
ture of Karl and his companions quickly died
down. The Archduke blessed his lucky stars
that things had so shaped themselves in his
favour. The sudden freeing of the yacht and
the return of the fog had made escape the sim-
plest of matters. As for the other Englishman
?the sharp-featured, interfering swine !?he
would find it impossible to follow them in
that cockleshell of a boat.
The Archduke rubbed his fat hands together
with satisfaction, and his little eyes twinkled
as he went below to see his prisoners.
Mr. Campion, Karl and Franz had been
taken to the saloon cabin. Franz had his
hands tied for security. Both he and Mr.


Campion were now without weapons, for one
of the first orders had been to search them. In
a corner of the cabin, seated on a locker, the
servant muttered to himself in the Magyar
tongue, glowering at his captor as the latter
entered.
?You see,? explained the Archduke, spread-
ing out his hands to the other two, ?you have
not been so clever, after all. I am not a fool
to be caught napping. And lam not such a fool
to believe all this you have told me ?you and
that other English swine. It is what you call
?bluff,? is it not? And bluff does not always
come off?no. There is Karl here : he bluffed
me. I compliment the Count von Iludemarke
on his cleverness, yes; but this talk of failure ?
of discovery of my plans?eh? That I do not
believe! ? ?
?Believe it or not, as you please.? Mr.
Campion spoke contemptuously. ?You will
learn the truth in due course. Take us to
France ?to Havre ?Paris?and you will find
out.?
The Archduke?s smiling satisfaction under-
went a change. A malevolent expression came
on his face.


?We shall see what we shall see,? he said
shortly. ?But you are my prisoners now. All
the cleverness of Strabig and his police will not
avail. You, my young Count, have played a
dangerous game. You cannot put your fingers
into the fire and not burn them. I have not
succeeded in catching the Prince, as I hoped.
That is one trick to you. But the game is not
yours. You are going to pay for your fool-
hardiness?yes; you and your friend here.
What is to prevent me sending you overboard
now, eh, if I choose ? lam master here; no one
dare lift a finger to save vou!?
O 1 7
Mr. Campion shrugged his shoulders. Karl,
from whose brain the effects of the drug had
now to a great extent passed, smiled wearily.
He cared little for the other?s wild words; he
knew the braggart man, knew that this bravado
was assumed to hide the fear that held his
soul.
The Archduke looked across at Franz, hud-
dled on the locker.
?That fool shall pay, if none else,? he said.
?You scum, to think you could thwart me ! You
swine of a dog! 5 ? He took a step across the
cabin and kicked the servant viciously. If ever


a man?s eves glared murder those of Franz did
so at that moment.
Having satisfied himself with insult and
vituperation the Archduke Otto swung out of
the cabin, leaving them to themselves.
Mr. Campion?s first act on his departure was
to free Franz. His pocket knife had been left
to him; only the Archduke?s revolver had been
taken from his pocket. He cut the rope that
bound the man?s wrists.
?Heaven knows what we can do,? he said,
?but a chance may come. Keep your hands
together, Franz, and let anyone think you
are still fettered. We can only wait.?
They sat thus for a considerable time, each
occupied with his own thoughts. The master
resolved in his mind the course he should pur-
sue on landing in France, for thither, undoubt-
edly the Christina was bearing them. There
must be some means of notifying the authorities
when they got to shore?unless their captor
made for some unfrequented part of the coast.
That possibility had to be taken into account.
The Archduke might have some hiding-place
wherein he could throw them, safe from prying
eves, until such time as he deemed fit to release
V ?


them. His mind worked swiftly, testing this
and that scheme as its practicability warranted.
Franz said nothing, having sunk into a sul-
len stupor. Karl, noting his companions? dejec-
tion, made a strong effort to be brave.
?You do not know Otto, as I do.? He gave
a smile as he spoke. ?The man is all words,
despite his loud talk. He will not harm us;
he dare not. I believe that when we come to
France and he discovers the truth, he will look
after his own safety and run. He will leave
us ?leave us stranded and get out of France
again as quickly as he can. Out of Europe, too,
probably, for the man is a coward. Yes, my
friend, we are in no great danger, I think.?
?I hope you are right, Karl,? returned Mr.
Campion. ?I fear his anger and malevolence
towards you. As he says, you fooled him. An
angry man may do wild things in the intensity
of his passion 1 But if things come to a head
we?ll make a fight for it! There are three of
us ? W e may be able to do something. ? ?
He tried to speak hopefully, but his heart
sank as he realised again the position in which
they were placed. The Archduke, coward or
no coward, held the whiphand. They were


prisoners on his yacht; on the high sea; with
his men at his command ?scoundrels all, no
doubt, and ready to do his bidding without
murmur.
Karl leant back now and closed his eyes. He
was obviously tired out with the exertion of the
past hours, while his brain felt dull with the
drug that had been administered to him. In-
fluenced by his example, Mr. Campion let him-
self fall into a half doze. He was just conscious
of the movement of the yacht as she surged
through the water, just conscious of sounds that
came to him from the deck above, the shout
of an order, the rattle of gear as the vessel
changed upon her course. The wash of the
waves as they broke against the side was sooth-
ing to the ear, and he was glad to relax his
senses and rest.
So, apparently asleep, they continued for
some while. No one came to disturb them.
The Archduke presumably was on deck with
the Captain, anxious as to the state of the
weather and eager to pick out the first sign of
a French light.
The crash of the collision came, therefore,
with startling suddenness to the occupants of


the cabin. They were thrown violently from
their seats, Mr. Campion?s head coming in con-
tact with a leg of the table and making him
dizzy. When they picked themselves up they
heard a confused shouting of voices above.
Then steps were heard hastening down the com-
panion to the saloon. A sailor threw open
the door.
?On deck !? he cried. ?Come up on deck !?
The three sprang up and followed. By this
time the Christina had heeled over to one side
with the shock of the impact. They found
themselves standing on a sloping deck, the
crew of the yacht gathered at the farther rail.
The big mainsail of the yacht flapped idly, for
she had come up head to wind.
Close by the stricken vessel was the blurred
outline of what appeared to be a fishing lugger.
The latter swung round to them again, answer-
ing the helm; hoarse voices cried to them in
French through the fog, and a heavy rope came
hurtling on to the deck. What happened next
was but dimly remembered by Mr. Campion and
Karl. Figures rushed about the deck ; orders
were shouted here and there: they saw the
Archduke?s fat figure crouching by a hatchway,


looking as if he had collapsed. The lugger
drew alongside, and its crew yelled to those on
the yacht to jump aboard. The Christina had
been badly hit; she was lying over still more,
and those on her deck had all their work to do
to keep a footing.
Several of the crew made a spring for the lug-
ger?s bulwarks. The captain, sighting Mr.
Campion and the boy, called to them to follow,
as he had already done to the Archduke, and
they lurched towards him. Ready hands were
extended from the lugger?s side, they were
pulled into safety and clung to the boat?s
shrouds as they stared back at the doomed
yacht.
?Franz! Where is Franz?? Mr. Campion
turned to the boy by his side, but Karl shook
his head blankly. For the moment he had for-
gotten his servant.
Then suddenly they saw him. Half veiled
in the fog, as the two boats drew apart once
more, they saw Franz make a leap across the
sloping deck to the crouching figure. He seized
the Archduke in his arms, and the two strug-
gled, swaying this way and that with the roll
of the vessel. The Archduke flung the man


from him and they saw the former turn round
to throw out his arms wildly in a supplication
for help. But no help was forthcoming. Ere
the darkness blotted out the scene they had a
sight of Franz leaping once more upon his
enemy. The two were locked in a fierce em-
brace, then the Christina gave a terrific lurch
as she went under, and the two figures slid down
the incline of the deck into the water.
Although the lugger stood by the scene of the
disaster not a sign of the missing men was to be
observed. The Archduke and Franz had dis-
appeared into the depths and the sea refused
to relinquish its hold upon them.
Mr. Campion with his arm tight in that of
Karl, peered out into the gloom. ?Poor
Franz!? he said. ?So the gods demanded a
life! He has died for Altburg, Karl?and bet-
ter that it was he than you!?
The lugger bore away from the scene as her
sails filled. All of the Christina?s crew and
passengers had been saved with the exception
of the two left behind. The fishing boat?s cap-
tain and his men set about making the rescued
ones comfortable. But hardly had they begun
in their voluable French to offer what hospi-


tality was available, when a fresh danger
threatened. Through the fog came the siren
of a steamer and they caught the throb of her
engines on the port bow. The shouting broke
out anew, and the ship?s bell was clanged vigor-
ously. Then, a few minutes later, the dark hull
of a big steamer loomed up near to them and
they saw the blur of her lights.
??Hard astern, there!? yelled a voice from
her bridge, to be answered by a torrent of
French. The steamer ranged alongside, her
deck seemingly crowded with people. Mr.
Campion ran to the lugger?s side. It was one
of the Channel packets, making for an English
port.
?Stand by, will you?? he shouted. ?Stand
by and take us off ! We?ve been wrecked ?Eng-
lish yacht! ? ?
An answering shout reached him. ?Ay!
ay ! Let her fall off! ?
Mr. Campion hastened to the lugger?s captain
and explained that the steamer would stand
by to pick up him and Karl. As for the yacht?s
crew, they had better be landed in France; they
could shift for themselves.
The skipper understood and, orders having


been given, the captain of the ?British Queen,?
whose name was to be made out from the life-
buoys by the rail, brought his boat alongside.
In a very little time the two were transferred to
the steamer, and with waving of hands the
fishing-boat dropped behind and was swallowed
up in the blackness.
On board the steamer Mr. Campion breathed
a sigh of relief and thankfulness. Their troubles
appeared to be over at last. The Archduke
was dead, he and Karl had escaped from his
clutches and were now on their way back to
England.
To a group of officers and passengers he was
explaining the circumstances of their plight
when a short, stockily-built man with a big,
heavy moustache thrust himself forward and
stared into Karl?s countenance.
?Herr Count!? he exclaimed.
?Strabig!? Karl?s face gleamed. ?You
here ! What does this mean ?? ?
?On my way to England, Herr Count. A
newspaper there sent a telegram conveying im-
portant news about the Archduke?s plot. I
came at once ?and to learn news of you as
well.?


?Strabig ?chief of police at Cheritza. You
remember him ?? Karl turned to his companion.
Mr. Campion grasped the other?s hand.
?We must go below,? he said. ?There is much
to tell. Come down to the saloon. I want
coffee ?coffee and something to eat. Karl and
I are famished. We?ve been through a trying
time. Let us sit and eat, and then talk. Stra-
big, this is good meeting you! We have news
for you that will open your eyes! ? ?
He led the police chief through the throng
of wondering passengers down to the saloon,
and there, comfortably ensconced with Karl,
and with food spread before them, he narrated
the events of the past twelve hours.
Strabig listened with amaze to the story, but
his face fell somewhat as he heard of the Arch-
duke?s fate. ?Slipped through my fingers,?
he muttered; ?just as all was complete. All
the threads in our hands : the man Schwartz
had told us all we wanted to know. The luck
of it! But there?s one villain less on the earth,
thank Heaven! And our Prince is safe. The
intended revolution has fizzled out, Herr
Count: Altburg is saved.
They talked long of affairs, for on each side


they had much to impart. In the midst of their
conversation the captain of the ?British
Queen? made his appearance to learn of the
nature of the disaster that had brought him his
extra passengers. Presently they went on deck
again, and now, with the sea-fog receding be-
hind them, they caught a glimpse of the shore
lights twinkling on the English coast.
Mr. Campion gripped Karl?s arm. ?Eng-
land ?? he murmured??and home, Karl!
Thank Heaven, you?ve come safely through,
lad!?
?And thank you, sir! You stuck to me,
didn?t you ? I shall never forget it, sir!?
They spoke little more; their hearts were
too full with thankfulness at this happy ending
to the adventure. Once, however, the master
voiced his wonder as to whether Allison had
got to land all right in the motor launch and
what account of them he had given.
?He is a good fellow to trouble himself about
me, isn?t he ?? said the boy with a tremor in his
voice. ?England has brought me many
friends.?
?Trouble?? Mr. Campion laughed. ?This is
a great time for Allison. He?s got what he


calls a ?scoop,? a big thing for his paper. And
he?s as happy as a sandboy. All the same,
Karl, Allison will be glad to see you?and to
see Strabig, too. He?d have stuck to us all
right on the Christina , if he?d got the chance.
Ah!? breaking off??There?s the lighthouse ?
and?do you see?? St. Mary?s Point. Over
there. We?ll be ashore in half an hour, Karl.
And then?Compton Prior and ?and ?? he
gave his jolly laugh ??and a warm bath for
me, old chap. A warm bath and a good sleep !? ?


CHAPTER XVIII.
Things are Made Clear.
?Yon never answered my question. Who is
Karl??
The speaker was Bob Allison, and he ad-
dressed himself to Mr. Campion. The house-
master had hastened down to the Priory Inn
to take lunch with the reporter. He had
snatched several hours? rest, and then answered
the urgent message from Allison who was all
impatience to learn the story of the night?s ad-
ventures. This was told in full, and the re-
porter made copious notes. Then he fired the
above question at the other.
?Yes, I intended to tell you,? replied Mr.
Campion. ?Here are the real facts. Karl is
cousin to the Prince Karl of Altburg. He is
Count of Rudemarke, a province in the State.
As you will know by the photographs you have


seen, the two are alike as the proverbial peas.
It is a most remarkable coincidence. This re-
semblance to his cousin used to be a great
source for joking to Karl ?our Karl. When
the trouble broke out, and we got wind of a
revolutionary plot that was hatching?the plot
you have been so busy upon?Karl was all
anxiety for the safety of his cousin?s throne.
Matters went from bad to worse. Otto, we had
reason to think, was working in with the revo-
lutionists; secret agents smelt that out for us.
But we could get no definite evidence. The cun-
ning old fox kept so much in the background,
pulling the strings from Paris or some other
centre, that nothing could be brought home to
him.?
?I know,? Allison put in; ?I found it hard
enough to get on the track of things! Com-
munications passed through several channels,
German, Russian or French, before they
reached the Archduke. Strabig has put me
wise on that point.?
Mr. Campion agreed. ?Then Karl came to
me one day,? he said, ?and suggested a plan.
He had thought of a ruse to draw the badger,
to lure Otto out into the open. Why not let


him personate the Prince, he said 1 Karl, his
cousin, who in another year would ascend the
throne (the Princess, his mother was regent),
could be conveniently sent on a journey?a sea
voyage, preferably ?travelling incognito, while
he?our Karl?could show himself somewhere
in the light of day where Otto would be tempted
to strike at him.
?It was a daring plan, and one attended with
danger. I confess I was against it from the
first. You see, I was tutor to this Karl, the
Count von Rudemarke, and I got to like the
lad immensely. He?s a splendid chap, Allison;
as plucky as they make them. The risk seemed
too terrible to me; heaven only knew to what
lengths the scoundrels might go. However,
Karl had his way. He?s a strong-willed chap,
and he said that if I didn?t consent and assist
him he?d take the bit between his teeth and bolt!
He won me over. The next thing to be discussed
was where to place Karl, where to hang out
the bait. About this time I heard of the retire-
ment of a man I knew, a Mr. Curtis, who was
giving up his house at Compton Prior. The
idea suggested itself to me. It could be given
out through certain agencies that the young


Prmce had gone to England for a year?s course
of training at an English college.
?We talked the scheme over with the Prin-
cess-Regent, and persuaded her to agree to it.
So things were set in train. The Prince?the
real one?was sent off for a cruise in the Medit-
erranean?he wasn?t let into the secret. I came
across here, saw Dr. Atterbury, and arranged
for Karl and myself to come. My ?Varsity de-
gree was good enough for Compton Prior, and
Atterbury had no fault to find with my refer-
ences. Well, it was fixed up all right. What
we had to be careful about was to sow the seed
skillfully; we didn?t want to make discovery too
easy for the Archduke, or he might have smelt
a rat. As it was, he got wind of Karl?s where-
abouts much more quickly than I anticipated,
which shows the excellence of his espionage.
You remember the attack made upon the boy,
out on the Bournewick Road? I believe that
was mis-timed; my idea is that the Archduke
meant to capture Karl without violence, and
hold him as a big pawn in the game. Anyway,
as a hostage he would be useful in case things
went wrong.


?And that,? concluded the master, ?ex-
plains much that no doubt puzzled you.?
?It did, indeed,? returned Allison. ?When
Toby Wenham wrote to his father about this
von Altburg at the school, speaking of him as
the Prince, and so on, and I had news of the
Prince having been recognised at Naples ?well,
I was puzzled. That was why, finally, I ran
down here to make inquiries in person. And it
seems I came only just in time. My hat! What a
chase it?s been! I?ve sent off a long message
this morning, Campion, and a topping story it
will make. The ?Record? will run out a special
edition for it?How?s the boy now?? he added,
breaking off.
?Lots better,? said the house-master.
?He?s quite got over the effects of that dope,
though he was a pretty sick man last night.
Quite a hero up at the school. The fellows are
all over him?especially the Junior School.
Some of ?em, I believe, have still got the notion
that he?s the Prince and has had another narrow
squeak of being assassinated. There?s a bunch
of them?a sort of bodyguard, self-styled Karl-
ists?who are kicking themselves for not having


watched over him more carefully! Funny young
beggars! 5 ?
Allison laughed, ?The age of romance isn?t
dead, is it!? he observed. ?Look at me, Cam-
pion. Reporter on a London daily: on crime
one day, doing a bit of descriptive work
another, then hurried off to the Riviera for the
Society folk, or faking correspondence for a ?silly
season? stunt, and so on. And last night chas-
ing a Bolshevik Archducal kidnapper in a crazy
motor-boat, to wind up with a sensational
tragedy! ?Archduke and Avenger hurled into
Sea! ? How the Americans would love the head-
line ! What a life it is ! Well, as our Prince of
comedians says, ?that?s thatV I'll be hiking
back to town now, and do the rest of this story.
It?s a good enough stunt to run for some days.?
Allison made an end of breakfast and filled
his pipe in readiness to stroll back to the school
with the house-master.
?I?d just like to shake hands with friend
Karl,? he said, ?and wish him luck. He?s a
well-plucked ?un, and no mistake. You?ve every
reason to be proud of him.?
?And Karl will be glad to meet you again,?
responded Mr. Campion. ? ?He has been talking


about you and wanting to thank you for com-
ing along to his rescue last night. Then, there?s
Toby, too; he thinks no end of you, you know.
Get that boy on the ?Record? soon, Allison, or
heTl break his heart.?
Up at the school Karl, as Mr. Campion had
stated, was being lionized by everyone. Lorri-
mer and Richardson on their return from
Bournewick had related the story of the kid-
napping and everybody was agog to know the
latest news. The re-appearance of Karl at
breakfast time had caused great excitement,
and the story of his adventures was demanded
as soon as the meal was over.
Karl himself was deeply moved by the genuine
thankfulness at his return on the part of his
special chums. The hearty grip of Lor-
rimer?s hand, of Monty?s, Parkyn?s and Cop-
wick?s, too, made him, in his still weak state,
more emotional than he cared to admit. As
for Toby, he literally danced for joy, though he
railed at the others for having gone off and left
him in the lurch.
Keeping within a respectable distance the
Badger, with a chosen few of the Karlists, re-
garded their hero?hero ten-fold now ?with


some awe. The real facts of the case had not
yet reached the ears of the juniors, and the most
wild rumours were current in the Den. What
was not to be blinked at, however, was the fact
that the Badger shone in the reflected light of
greatness as the Chief of the Karlists. His
sturdy figure swelled with pride and it took
the united efforts of four Gideonites to reduce
him to a normal state of humility.
With the death of the Archduke Otto, and the
subsequent arrest of other prominent factors
in the ?Altburg Plot,? as it was known after
the ?Record?s? sensational disclosures, the
prime movers therein disappeared. There was
one personage, however, whom fate had not
yet laid by the heels. The ingenuous Mr.
Baumer, wine merchant, still roamed the world.
Since his successful capture of Karl and his
delivery of the goods to the Archduke, Mr.
Baumer with all due modesty had effaced him-
self. It was well for him, it may be added,
that Karl had only a faint recollection of the
man who had surprised him in his study that
evening.
It is an extraordinary fact well-known to
criminologists, we believe, and not explicable


by all, that a criminal will return sooner or later
to the scene of his crime. Only a psychologist,
therefore, can explain the extraordinary inci-
dent that marked the afternoon of a certain
Saturday about two weeks after the events
above related.
On the afternoon in question, Karl von Alt-
burg?or von Rudemarke, to be more correct?
was again in Bournewick. In company with
Mr. Campion, and his chums Lorrimer and
Copwick, he was striding along the cliff path in
the direction of the little village of Eishbourne
which they had visited on a previous memorable
day. The weather was delightful as before,
only warmer; and the four of them talked and
joked as if nothing had happened to cast a
shadow on their lives. It had been decided that
Karl should stay on at Compton Prior. It was
his own wish. He liked his life at the school;
he had formed strong friendships there; and,
whether he returned later or not, he asked to be
allowed to remain for the rest of the term.
Casting his eye seaward, Mr. Campion es-
pied, gleaming in the sun, the white sails of a
yacht that was bearing up-Channel. He re-
called their other walk along the cliffs.


?No danger there now, Karl!? he laughed;
pointing out the boat with his stick.
And at that precise moment, as fate would
have it, there swung over the top of the little
hill they were climbing a striking-looking fig-
ure. It was that of a tall, broad-shouldered
man in a golfing cap and ? plus-fours. ? He car-
ried a stout stick in his hand and he puffed
vigorously at a fat cigar. As this individual
approached them Karl?s face paled; he felt a
strange sinking at his heart. That round florid
face ?that iron-grey moustache !??He remem-
bered suddenly. That awful night in the study,
when someone had dropped into the room from
the window. He had caught just a glimpse ?
nothing more ?of the face that bent over him
as something was pressed upon his mouth.
He gave an exclamation and stood stock-still.
?Mr. Campion!? he cried ??that?s the man!
The man who ??
The house-master needed no second warning.
He ran forward to meet the newcomer, and the
latter, alive to the fact that he was in danger,
swung round in the direction whence he had
come. He ran ?ran as fast as his thick legs


could carry him, and Mr. Campion tore on up
the hill after him.
But Nemesis was in waiting. The fugitive
turned off the path into the undergrowth in the
endeavour to find a track leading down the cliff-
side, and immediately stumbled over some ob-
stacle. The obstacle was insurmountable; it
wound its arms round his legs and refused to
relinquish its hold. The captive man struck
savagely at it with his stick, and howl after
howl went up as the blows fell. Then Mr.
Baumer, for it was none other, freed one leg
and kicked wildly at the small boy in the school
cap who clung tenaciously to him despite the
fierce onslaught that was being made. It was
quite evident that Mr. Baumer?s affection for
Compton Prior school did not extend to any of
its inmates.
A minute or so later Mr. Campion arrived on
the scene, and a well-directed blow sent the as-
sailant prone to the ground. While he lay
there, cursing and groaning, the Badger strug-
gled to his feet and presented a dirt-begrimed
and bleeding face to the master?s gaze.
'?Well done, young ?un!? said the latter.
?Well collared !?Get up, you !? he added, with

THE CAPTIVE MAN STRUCK SAVAGELY AT IT.


?


a contemptuous kick at the prostrate Mr.
Baumer who evinced no desire to regain an erect
posture.
By this time Karl and his companions had
joined them. There was little or no doubt in
the house-master?s mind now as to the identity
of the captive. He saw before him again the
blue-painted car outside the school, and the big,
moustached man therein smoking a cigar.
Karl?s instinct had been right; this was clearly
the man, the agent of the Archduke, who had
spirited the boy away.
He stooped and pulled the unfortunate man
to his feet. Then, under close guard, Mr.
Baumer, protesting volubly in guttural Eng-
lish, was marched back into Bournewick where
he was given into custody, pending enquiries.
Mr. Campion preferred the charge against him,
and the ingenuous wine merchant was taken
within to the security of a cell.
The capture of this notable personage may be
said to have removed from the scene the last of
Karl?s enemies. In due course, Mr. Baumer,
convicted of assault and complicity in the ne-
farious schemes of his late master, received an
exemplary sentence. He passes out of our story
into well-deserved oblivion.


As for the Badger, words cannot adequately
express the glory with which the Karlist Chief
was now surrounded. The Den hung upon his
lips as he related how he, the ?lone Scout,?
deserted by his band, had stuck to his post and
dogged the steps of Karl and his companions
that afternoon. The great and heroic fight upon
the cliff was the subject of the school?s discus-
sion for days, and the Kirkeite juniors shared
their leader?s radiance. That the Microbe
should compose an Ode in his honour was inevit-
able. It was never read, except by the Microbe
himself when a junior could be button-holed,
but it told in bold, if halting, metre the epic
story.


CHAPTER XIX.
?Gentlemen, The Prince,?
The history lesson was in full swing in the
Lower Third classroom. Mr. Donaldson had
been holding forth on the glories of Elizabeth?s
reign, and the expansion of Britain?s posses-
sions oversea. It was a great theme, an en-
thralling subject for a lecture, but even the
master?s eloquence failed to stir enthusiasm in
the minds of his hearers. Perhaps it was the
heat of the warm July day; perhaps the story
of Queen Bess?s greatness and the daring of
her sea-captains had become too familiar to the
score of boys who lolled at their desks. They
listened with obvious languor and mechani-
cally followed the master?s pointer as it traced
the New World settlements on the big map.
By the open window, through which
streamed the pleasant sun, the Microbe put
all thoughts of sixteenth-century exploration


out of his head, and abandoned himself to dis-
tractions of his own. Outside there was much
to attract his attention. In the elms across the
garden were families of rooks among whom
there had broken out a most wordy warfare.
He took sides in the debate, and was rejoiced
to see eventually that the family he had selec-
ted came off victors in the squabble, driving off
the malcontents with vigour. Then a bumble-
bee droned across towards him, the noise it
made harmonising curiously with the sound of
Mr. Donaldson?s voice.
He followed its course among the flower-
beds, and idly sought in his mind for a rhyme
to its name. Indifferent to apiarian scientific
fact, he was consigning it to its hive when a
cat that had been lurking in a clump of del-
phiniums sprang up and clawed the insect to
the earth. The Microbe, interested at once in
this tragedy, craned his neck to obtain a better
view of the scene, and was recalled to more
serious matters by Mr. Donaldson?s voice.
? What was Sir John Hawkins? quest in his
earliest voyages, Power?? asked the master.
? Doubloons, sir,? said the Microbe, with a
vague remembrance of ?Westward Ho!? and


other tales of the Spanish Main crossing his
mind.
I expected some such silly answer,? ex-
claimed Mr. Donaldson. ?If you paid more
attention to the lesson instead of dreaming,
you would have known that it was negroes.
You will write me out an essay on Hawkins?
voyages and bring it to me to-morrow. Now,
to resume. After reaching the Isthmus, Francis
Drake ? 5
The historical summary droned on, and the
Microbe, inwardly condemning all niggers and
Sir John Hawkins in particular, endeavoured
to concentrate his attention upon the subject
in hand. But the effort in time proved too
much for him. Again glancing out of the
window, what time Mr. Donaldson was devot-
ing himself to explaining a difficult point to
an anxious inquirer he became interested in a
party of three people who were passing along
the side road that ran beyond the garden.
The tops of their heads were visible above
the low hedge. One of the travellers wore a
soft hat of the Homburg variety, another a
curiously shaped peaked cap, and the third a
white-topped yachting cap. In themselves,


these objects were interesting, even exciting.
They had a rather foreign look to the Microbe?s
eyes. When their wearers strolled past the
garden, he noted that they stopped for a few
moments and looked across in his direction.
The Homburg-hatted one said something to
the wearer of the yachting cap, who nodded in
reply; then they went on to the garden gate.
Here, to the Microbe?s joy, they entered, and he
observed the three walking along the gravel
path that led to the house entrance.
The owner of the yachting cap, he was
pleased to note, was suitably attired and was
evidently no mere swanker posing as a seafarer.
His white ? ducks ? were the correct thing,
and his neatly cut blue reefer jacket with brass
buttons carried conviction. The gentleman in
the Homburg hat was also in ? ducks,? but his
coat had less of a nautical cut about it. The
third member of the party was presumably a
man from the yacht, for he wore a blue jersey
with some name printed across it in red.
?Crikey!? murmured the Microbe to him-
self. ?Visitors! And not ordinary ones,
either. Golly!? His face lighted up. ?I


wonder whether they?re any of Karl?s people?
Got a rum foreign look about ?em.?
He recalled himself from these speculations
in time to catch the last words of Mr. Donald-
son?s concluding sentence, and in answer to
the question suddenly flung at him, hazarded
a reckless ? Nombre Dios Bay, sir.? The
shot hit the mark this time, and the master,
while distrustful of the concentration that the
answer implied, had to rest content.
The Microbe, in an eager whisper, sent
the news round the classroom that distin-
guished foreigners were paying a visit to the
school, and when at last the history lesson
came to a welcome end, the Lower Third boys
trooped out to test the truth of the Microbe?s
statement.
Their minds were soon set at ease. In the
larger quadrangle they saw the newcomers,
exactly as the Microbe had pictured them,
under the escort of Mr. Campion. The master
was talking to them in a language that was
unintelligible to the ears of a Compton
Priorite, and the Homburg hat and the yacht-
ing cap were punctuating his remarks with
emphatic nods. Then the party walked across


in the direction of the Schoolhouse, and dis-
appeared from view under the arched entrance.
?More Huns?? queried Carter, a well-
known adherent of Mabberley.
Friends of Karl?s, I expect,? said the
Badger, who had joined the spectators and
gleaned the news. ? And friends of his are
our friends, young Carter, so you shut up!?
Carter withdrew, promptly subdued.
The Badger then led the way to the School-
house, to see what further news he could
gather, and was rewarded by seeing Karl him-
self on the steps warmly shaking hands with
the young gentleman in the yachting cap. Now
that he had a nearer view he was instantly
struck by the close resemblance between the
two. Yachting cap, indeed, might have been
Karl?s twin brother, as he stood there smiling
beside him.
? Ah, Badgerley,? exclaimed Mr. Campion,
catching sight of the junior at that moment,
Run round to the Doctor?s house, will you,
and tell him that the Prince Von Altburg has
arrived at the school, and will call upon him
immediately. The Prince Von Altburg, re-
member ! ? ?


The Badger, with eyes agleam, hastened off
upon his errand. Here was news, indeed. The
Microbe?s conjectures had not been so far
wrong after all.
The fact that the Prince of Altburg ?the
real prince this time ?was in the school was
quickly noised abroad. It was known that
Doctor Atterbury had received him in audience,
had personally conducted him through the
place, and had left him again in the charge of
Mr, Campion. A score of tongues were set
babbling, the popular acceptation being that
His Royal Highness had come to fetch away
Karl, and that a guard of honour from an
Altburg warship (assuming the State possessed
one) would presently come marching up to the
school.
In the interval, the Prince was holding an
informal levee in Mr. Campion?s room, where
Karl?s friends?Lorrimer, Wenham, Mont-
gomery, Cop wick and Parkyn?were intro-
duced to him. A delightful young fellow this
Prince proved to be. A year older than Karl,
perhaps, but with the same open, smiling face
and the same charm of manner. It was only
when you saw the two close together that you


noted the real point of difference. The Prince
had lighter eyes than Karl?s; they were more
grey than blue; his hair, too, was lighter. And
when he spoke there was a deeper tone in his
voice. His English, moreover, was more
limited in its vocabulary than his cousin?s; his
attempts to express himself in colloquial phrases
were amusing.
The introductions having been made, Karl
carried off the Prince to his own study, to-
gether with his chums. Herr Hoffman, the
possessor of the Homburg hat, and an official
of the Prince?s household, remained with the
master to discuss further matters. There was
just time before dinner for a ? yap,? and the
Prince was boyishly curious to see something
of the inside of English school life.
But Compton Prior was not to be delighted
with the sight of a royal personage dining in
its big hall. The Prince obtained leave from
the Head to carry Karl, Lorrimer, Wenham,
Monty and Copwick away with him to Bourne-
wich, where he had telephoned for a lunch to
be prepared. Parkyn, included in the invita-
tion, had reluctantly to decline, as he was


down that afternoon for swimming instruction
to a party of juniors.
The Prince?s launch was waiting at the
bridge, and in due time the five seniors were
speeding down the river to the little town.
And what a lunch it was in the Pavilion Hotel!
? The sumptuous repast,? said Toby in his best
journalese, ? must have taxed the resources of
mine host to the utmost. The table literally
groaned under the generous spread of viands.?
Before the end of the meal, the Prince, in his
imperfect English, and helped out by Karl,
made a little speech of thanks for their recep-
tion of him at the school. But the real speech,
the one that mattered, was that in which he told
them again the story of his cousin?s pluck and
self-sacrifice.
? I did not know,? he said (and we need
not try to reproduce the halting way in which
he expressed himself), ? I did not know what
my mother, the Princess, and Mr. Campion
and Karl had so arranged. As you have
heard, I went off on a cruise in the Mediter-
ranean. I was all ? in the dark ? as you say;
had I known what Karl here proposed to do,
believe me, I should not have consented. For


it was dangerous work. The Archduke Otto
was a man who would not have stopped at
assassination if it meant the success of his
plans. He was a terrible man, a relentless
enemy, and my life was not safe while he was
free to plot against me. Karl took a great
risk, a very great risk, and Mr. Campion has
told me what peril he has been through for my
sake. You may well be proud of him. you who
know him here, as I am proud to call him kins-
man. But all is well that ends well. Otto is
dead, and Altburg is freed from his plotting.
We can go forward now without fear, Karl
and T. For Karl is needed in Altburg, gentle-
men. I have work for him to do.? He smiled
down upon the boy by his side, and as Karl
looked up at him, smiling, in return, the others
were again struck by the remarkable resem-
blance between the two. It was no wonder
that Baumer had been misled into believing
Karl to be the Prince. It was onlv the sharp
eve of the Archduke that had immediately de-
tected the points of difference on being con-
fronted with his captive on board the
Christina.
The Prince went on to tell how he had


become acquainted with the news of the at-
tempt on Karl?s life. A telegram from Strabig
had apprised him of the Archduke Otto?s
death. He had at once turned his yacht to-
wards England, for the Chief of Police had
intimated that Karl was at Bournewick, and
he wanted to learn what had happened. On
the way, he had put in at Havre, and there had
met Strabig, who was interesting himself in
the whereabouts of the crew of the Archduke?s
wrecked yacht. From Strabig he learned the
details of the disaster, and gathered enough of
Karl?s story to send him post-haste to Bourne-
wick and Compton Prior.
Karl now cut the story short by declaring
that they had sat long enough, and wanted no
more backslapping. He wanted his friends to
see the Prince?s steam yacht, the Brunhild ,
and accordingly they set off in the launch to
visit the ship. When, an hour or two later the
boys returned to the school, leaving the Prince
with a promise that they should see him again
before he sailed, it was with the satisfaction
that they had spent a most enjoyable after-
noon .
?My hat! Your cousin didn?t half lay it


on about you, Karl!? remarked Toby, after
they had stepped out of the launch and were
walking up the road from the bridge. �� I
don?t wonder you blushed like a peony.?
? That is just like the Prince,? returned
Karl simply. �C He is the best of fellows. I,
who am his cousin, know. But I only blushed
once, Toby. That was when he called me a
c bravo.? I wanted to laugh really, but it
would have hurt his feelings !? ?
Toby Wenham grinned. �� I know he did!?
he said. �� But we all knew what he meant.
And I suppose a bravo was a jolly plucky chap
too, Karl, so he wasn?t much out.?
That evening there was another � � brew : ? in
Wenham?s study this time. They talked of the
coming holidays, of their plans, of the probable
results of the examinations just concluded.
�� Bet you you?ve collared the Elphinstone,
Lorry,? said Tobv. �� Only hope you?ve left
me the Maxwell. Though, what I want with a
scholarship goodness knows! I?d far rather
win a place in the 'Record? office ! That reminds
me,? he added, "the guv?nor?s done a topping
notice of my article in the ?Prior.? Hello, what?s
this? The Microbe? Post just come in??


Wenham took the three letters which the fag
had brought and glanced at them quickly.
? That?s from home,? he said, placing one
on the table; ?that?s a bill from Wainwright?s
for my last racquet; and this??? He looked
at the postmark curiously. ? Portsmouth *
Who on earth is this from??
He ripped open the envelope and scanned
the letter. Then he gave a laugh.
? I say, you fellows ! Here?s a joke ! That
screed of mine on the school ghost has caught
a fish. I?ve got a bite! This is from a chap
named Ponsonby?writes from Portsmouth to
say that his local branch of the Psychical
Research Society is greatly interested in the
article appearing in the ? Prior,? a copy of
which has been forwarded to him by a friend.
He would be honoured if the editor
would allow him to send a communication for
publication in the next issue of the magazine.
His Society regard the recent manifestation at
Compton Prior School as having special in-
terest for them, and the members have already
had a most illuminating discussion on the sub-
ject. He remains, mine very truly, J. Mickle-
white Ponsonby.?


Toby laid the envelope down and joined in
the merriment which the letter had caused.
He danced round the room,waving the missive
in his hand.
?I?ve clicked!? he cried. ?I?ve clicked I
The ? Prior ? has become famous in the great
world! Oh, what a priceless joke! I say,
what shall we do? Invite the jolly old Psychi-
cal Researchers to come along and hold their
seance, or whatever they call it, here ? We
might rig up a show for them, eh ? If only the
dear old Head had a sense of humour I'd
suggest it to him! It seems too good an oppor-
tunity to be lost.?
The Microbe, standing by the door, with
his little eyes twinkling, took in his master s
words with due regard for their importance.
This was a titbit of news for the Den.
? What are you grinning at, you young
scamp?? demanded Toby, turning upon him.
? Cut off and tell the world that the ? Prior
has fluttered the dovecotes of the great! Tell
the world
But the Microbe had fled, and they heard the
patter of his feet as he took the stairs two at
a time on his way to the lower floor.


? It?s a great joke, certainly,? said Lorri-
mer. ?Congrats., Toby, on the quality of
your style- By the way, it was Pottlewell, you
know, who worked the trick in the cellars.
You might shove his portrait in the next
number of the mag. Perhaps the Portsmouth-
ians will elect him an honorary member! ? ?
The receipt of this tribute to the school
magazine?s editor made a fitting climax to
what was voted unanimously as a great day.
They broke up in high spirits, but they would
have been still more elated could they have fore-
seen what was to be the result of the Microbe?s
mission to tell the world?his world ?of the
remarkable communication which the even-
ing?s post had brought.


CHAPTER XX.
The Ghost Rag.
? I tell you what, you chaps,? said the
Badger, addressing an eager audience in the
Junior Common Room. ?We can have the
best rag that the school has known! Wen-
ham won?t do anything about those spook-
hunters from Portsmouth the Microbe told us
of. He?ll be too scared of the Head to let him-
self go. We'll do it! We?ll lay the ghost!
What do you say??
The inmates of the Den said, and said it em-
phatically, that they were one and all with the
Badger in this new stunt. When the Microbe
reported the extraordinary intelligence he had
gleaned in his fag-master?s room, his intimates
were duly impressed. Something, without
doubt, ought to be done in the circumstances.
What was the use of possessing a school ghost


if you didn?t make some capital out of it ? The
jolly old spirit of Prior Anselin, or Brother
Martin, as the case may be, had been exploited
on one memorable occasion, but here was the
famous ghost achieving fame, thanks to the
?Prior? editor?s efforts.
The Badger held conference, and the result
of the conclave in the Den was that a unani-
mous resolution was passed to the effect that at
the earliest opportunity the juniors should hold
a great ?Ghost Rag.?
?Leave it to me and Belton and the
Microbe,? said the chairman. ?By next Wed-
nesday we?ll have everything ready. You chaps
stand by till we give the word, and then we?ll
make things hum! Potty, you can be First
Mourner; he?s your ghost, you know, in a sort
of way. Round up a dozen more mourners; as
many top hats as you can get.?
Pottlewell grinned and promised to carry out
instructions. The rest of the Den possessed
themselves with patience, having full confidence
in their leader s ability to provide them with a
half day?s amusement.
So Wednesday arrived. During the mid-day
meal the Badger passed the word round:


?Stand by to meet outside Gideon?s ?2.45
sharp ! ? At the time named over thirty juniors,
variously attired, had congregated near the en-
trance of the house. Conspicuous among them
were Pottlewell and a dozen other boys, garbed
in great-coats and top hats.
A buzz of talk went round the throng.
?Hello, Badger! Come on; hurry up!?
With Belton in attendance the Karlist chief
came round the corner at a run.
?All ready?? he shouted. ?Right! To the
Cellars ! To the cellars ! The Ghost Hunt
begins! ? ?
As the rabble of the French Revolution re-
sponded to the cry ?a la lanterne!? so did the
Badger?s followers haste to his call.
The cellars! The cellars! Yoicks! For-
ward!? The juniors raised their war-cries and
dashed after their chief and his lieutenant who
had set the pace. In a wild mob they scram-
bled down the steps and flung themselves into
the dark recesses of the vaults.
One of the investigators, who hailed from a
hunting district, gave tongue in the approved
fashion. Gone away! Tally ho!? he cried.
?Tallv ho!?
V


The cellars resounded with the shouting and
laughter. Then there came a yell from the
innermost chamber. ?Run to earth, boys!
Here! Here!?
With a wild rush to the spot whence the call
had proceeded the ghost-hunters fought their
way in, to behold the Badger standing in front
of a weird-looking object which the Microbe,
somewhat dishevelled and dusty, was main-
taining in an upright position. It was the
?kill.? The ghost had been run to earth !
Hot him. you chaps!? exclaimed the Bad-
ger. exultantly. ?And he?s a beauty! Wait
till we get him into the light of day.?
His followers made a path through their
ranks as the ?monk ghost? was borne through
their midst. It was an extraordinary contraption
being composed of an old sack stuffed with shav-
ings, rag and other odds and ends, and fash-
ioned with the semblance of a head and arms,
but minus legs. Over the head itself was drawn
a white hood, with two holes cut therein to
serve as eye-holes. The construction of this fig-
ure had occupied its inventors several hours,
but the shrieks of delight with which it was
greeted amply repaid them for the labour.


With due solemnity the <c monk-ghost? was
carried shoulder-high up the steps and deposited
on the ground in the centre of an admiring
circle.
?Now then, Potty/? commanded the Badger,
?form up your gang. And you other chaps fall
in behind. No breaking away, mind, till we?re
through the playing-fields. Then it?s a rush for
the river. We?re going to jolly well bury the
ghost?drown him ! Come on; keep together !
All ready??
In a few moments the procession was formed
and the school ?at least, those members of it
who were not in the secret ?were astonished to
see a crowd of boys marching slowly through the
grounds on their way to the field, bearing at
their head the strange effigy. The Badger and
Belton held the figure of the ?monk-ghost?
well in view, and a fearsome spectacle it afforded
as it swayed from side to side with their move-
ments.
A wag started ?John Brown?s Body,? and
the processionists took up the chorus with gus-
to. One or two bright spirits essayed a dance
on the outskirts of the ?cortbge.? Por the


most part, however, the followers of the ??monk-
ghost? preserved a suitable decorum.
From the houses they passed surprised faces
stared at them through the windows.
?Oh, my giddy aunt!? cried Francis of
Gideon?s. ?Did you ever see such a sight! Am
I dreaming ? Is it the Fifth of November?or
what??
Montgomery, who was about to pay a visit
to the Rev. Septimus, halted by his side and
gazed out on the scene.
?Potty!? he gasped. Look at him! Pot-
tlewell! And whose hat has he scrounged??
. The First Mourner, indeed, was more of a
figure for mirth than compassion. A top hat,
by no means new and two sizes too large for
him, almost eclipsed his face. He stalked
along, however, at the head of his great-coated,
hatted contingent, and looked to neither right
nor left.
Mr. Gilbert Kirke, beneath whose window
they passed soon after (?give the beaks a
show,? ordered the Badger), took in the situa-
tion and roared lustily at the spectacle.
?They?ve got it!? he observed to Parkyn,
who, in flannels, was ready to go down to a


scratch game. ? The old monk, just as Wenham
described it ?cowl and all. And that rope gir-
dle round its waist!? He paid a tribute to this
last inspiration of the Microbe with another
roar of laughter.
So, evoking surprise and merriment in the
course of their progress, the ?layers of the
ghost? held on their way to the field, where a
game of cricket was just ready to commence.
Straight across the ground they marched, to be
greeted with wild cheers and to add others to
their number; straight across the pitch, re-
gardless of players and umpires; straight on
and down the slope beyond to the river.
Here the tension broke. With a fierce yell
the members of the procession broke their ranks.
The Badger and Belton bounded ahead, and
after them, in full cry, came the pack.
?Yoicks! For?ard! Gone awa?a?y!?
shouted the hunting enthusiast, and the field
resounded with the response.
By now Pottlewell and his sombre-clad
fellow-mourners had cast dignity to the winds.
With their hats wagging on their heads, and
their long coats flapping as they ran, they sped
helter-skelter down to the river-side. On the


stream were a number of boats just starting
off, while many boys, mostly seniors, were
watching and assisting. Farther off, upon the
bridge that spanned the Dibbin. Wenham and
Karl, returning from a brief journey to the
village, regarded the uproar with amazement.
?What on earth?! Why ?its?s my ghost \?
cried Toby suddenly. ?I declare they?ve faked
up my old monk! Look. Karl! Hood and
all! Oh, my hat! And they?re going to drown
it!?
As he spoke the mass of boys surged down
to the bank. There was a sudden pause; then
the Badger and Belton took the ?ghost? by
the ends, swung it thrice and heaved the ?poor,
restless spirit? out on to the river. It fell with
a great splash, that was cheered again and
again, while the special mourners stood hat in
hand to see the last of their friend.
?Vex not his ghost! Oh, let him pass!?
chanted the Microbe, apt with quotation to the
last. ?Stretch him no longer on the rack of
this tough world.?
Back? echoed O?Donell, who caught at
the word. ?We?ll rack him! come on, boys I
At him!?


He stooped and pulled out a stone from the
bank. ?Plonk!? went the missile, hitting the
dejected-looking figure in the middle as it
floated slowly down the stream, turning this
way and that with the eddies.
His action was the signal for a storm of
stones, clods of earth and sticks. The ghost had
been ?laid;? its burial was now to be com-
pleted. But the ?restless spirit,? encased in
sack and linen, was not to be so easily got rid
of. On it floated, a grim and very human ob-
ject as it made its way along. A host of boys
from bank and bridge watched its movements
with eager interest.
The bobbing ?monk-ghost? was within a few
yards of the bridge when there shot from under
the latter a light skiff of the racing type, pro-
pelled by a broad-backed figure in flannels.
Mabberley, out early for a solus spin, was put-
ting in his best work. His stroke was clean
and even; he ?feathered? his oars with an
almost professional touch.
The intent spectators gave the rower a hail
as he came into sight. They foresaw with de-
light that a collision was imminent. And an
instant or two later the inevitable happened.


Mabberley?s right oar fouled the half-submerged
sack with its cowled head turned towards him.
His frail craft swayed with the impact. Then
the rower's eye fell upon the terrible-looking
object, with the two staring holes in its hood,
and he fell back heavily with a gasp of aston-
ishment. To the delight of everyone the skiff
toppled over sideways and Mabberley was flung
into the water.
There were yells of delight at this; yells
of derision, while a few voices cried ?Rescue !?
Some boats at the little landing-stage were
hastily manned, and parties of juniors plunged
out on the stream towards the floundering Mab-
berley, whose proficiency at swimming was high
enough to enable him to keep afloat and paddle
towards shore.
The Badger saw in this untoward event a
happy chance that was not to be disregarded.
Here was his enemy?the enemy, indeed, of all
the juniors? at their mercy. ?Attaboy!? he
whispered fiercely to Belton; and, with the
light of battle in his eye, he steered his boat
towards the swimmer.
Here you are, Bounder!? he cried, coming
alongside the gasping Mabberley before the


others could reach him. 'Hang on! Well
pull you out.?
The senior made a frantic grab at the gun-
wale, causing the boat to rock dangerously.
Then, while the rest trimmed the craft, the Bad-
ger and Belton endeavoured to assist Mabber-
ley into safety. But, alas! scarcely had he
gained a few inches before his grasp on the boat
was released. Back into the water he sank,
gulping a mouthful to his intense disgust.
?Clumsy young idiots!? he spluttered,
thrashing the water with his arms and strug-
gling for breath. ?Give me a hand! Quick!?
DO
The boat was pulled alongside again. And
once more the two sturdy juniors gripped his
arms and strove to pull him in board. This time
they were successful. But no sooner was the
panting Mabberley on the back thwart than wil-
ling hands seized his legs, while others aided
in levering up his bulky body. Over the stern
he went to fall again with a tremendous splash
into the water.
?You ?? he began in frenzied tones, but the
river Dibbin received the epithet he intended to
hurl at his tormentors.
Another wild yell of delight went up from the


bank. The juniors were enjoying to the full the
downfall of the notorious bully.
?Sink him, Badger!? Souse him!? came
the encouraging cries. And for some little time
Mabberley had the most humiliating experience
of his life. When at length the juniors permit-
ted him to reach shore, he crawled up the steps
a miserable, dejected youth. All the fire and
bluster had departed from him. His strength
was spent, and he could do no more than beg
to be let alone.
?That?s wan towards quits, Bounder!? ob-
served 0 Donell, as he eyed the senior?s prone
and dripping figure with contempt. ?May it
be a lesson to ye! Though, faith! ye?re scarce
worth the trouble!?
Wenham had followed the proceedings with
a full recognition of the circumstances that had
led up to this reprisal.
?See that, Karl?? he remarked. ?Comrade
Mabberley comes into his own. You remember
punching him, don?t you, for bullying young
Badgerley ? The Bounder put up many such a
score against himself. And, my hat! The
kids aren?t half paying him back ! They?re sore
enough about it to pretty well drown him!? ?


Karl shrugged his shoulders. Mabberley
no doubt deserved all he got. And he noted
that no other senior present moved a finger in
the victim?s interest. The Fifth Form bully had
lost his only real friend when Shotter had
shaken off the dust of the school from his shoes.
By this time, of course, the effigy of the
?monk-ghost? had disappeared under the arch
of the bridge and was some distance down the
stream. The juniors abandoned further inter-
est in its welfare, and, the ghost having been
?well and truly laid,? they set themselves to
other diversions.
Said Mr. Gilbert Kirke in the Masters?
Room the following day:
?Funny young cub that Badgerley. Boys
are queer when you come to know them. I
had my window a bit open in my room before I
came down, and heard the youngster talking
to Mabberley just below. Talking to him like
the proverbial Dutch uncle, you know. ?You
are a frowsy beast, Bounder,? he was saying,
?but you?ve left off calling Karl a Hun. You
really are quite civil to him now that your rot-
ten pal Shotter has gone. So you?ve got some
sense of decency in you, Bounder. We?re cal-


ling pax with you now, after yesterday. See ?
You behave yourself and the Den won?t worry
you.' As you men know, Badgerley and his
friends have had a good deal to put with from
Mabberley in the past. So it was really mag-
nanimous of him to hand out the olive branch.
<c Oh yes, and what do you think the young
beggar went on to say ? ?One thing I like about
you, Bounder,? he said, ?is your politics.
You?re ?agin the Government,? aren?t you?
Well, so are we, mostly, though we don?t fly
the Red Flag quite. You go on and do what
you can for us. I was reading a bit in the paper
the other day about schools in Russia being run
by the boys themselves. That?s what we want
here, Bounder. You get your Guv?nor in Par-
liament to push that scheme along. See?
Schools in England are a jolly sight too hard.
That?s all for the present, Bounder. You go
along and think it over.? ?
The Rev. Septimus Gideon blinked through
his spectacles .
The Red Flag among the juniors!? he
sighed. ?Heaven save us! Your ?Lambs? are
quite enough of a handful without any element


of Moscow, Gideon. Master Badgerley?s
schemes must be nipped in the bud.?
Quite unconscious that his aspirations to-
wards Communistic ideals were being thus
freely discussed, the Badger was even then hold-
ing forth to a select circle in the Den.
?Jolly good rag it was,? he declared; ?and
I only wish the old ghost-hunters from Ports-
mouth could have seen it. I don?t wonder the
Bounder got scared and upset when the blessed
thing came spinning round his boat. Beastly
sight it looked, didn?t it? I say, you chaps,
I?ve cried pax with the Bounder. We?re to let
him alone now. See? And now we?ve had the
last rag of the term. There?s just one more
thing to be done, but I?m saving that for the
last night. Keep your hair on! You won?t
miss it. Though after some things that have
happened I don?t know that you chaps deserve
it. Just hang on and I?ll let you into it ?Hang
it, there?s Parkyn yelling for me!?
And the Badger disappeared, leaving his fol-
lowers to speculate upon this latest idea of their
chief.


CHAPTER XXI.
The Last Night.
Lorrimer was speaking.
? Are your glasses charged? All standing,
please. Gentlemen, I give you the toast?His
Serene Highness ! 5 ?
?The Prince!??? Prince Karl!??? Our
Karl, and cheerio!?
The response was spontaneous and pro-
longed. Karl, looking up at the friendly,
smiling faces around him, felt overwhelmed.
It was a merry party that was assembled in
the School Captain?s study that evening, on
the last day of the term. Lorrimer was giving
a brew in honour of his chum, and to wish
him good-bye on his return to Altburg. It


was now settled that Karl would not come back
to Compton Prior.
?Speech! Speech!? came the cries from
Montgomery, Parkyn, Wenham and Cop wick
?his tried, true friends ?and the two or three
others invited.
Karl rose to his feet and bowed with that
old-fashioned courtesy which distinguished
him.
? Lorrimer ?and you fellows,? he began,
? I?m not a Prince, you know that ?
?Yes, you are, old man. Our Prince! Our
Prince Karl!?
Karl waved the interruption aside. ? I
can?t tell you,? he went on, ? how much I feel
this ?this jolly good will which you show me.
I could never have dreamed when I first came
to the school, that I should meet with such
splendid men as you. It?s been the happiest
time of my life?happiest, that is, except for
the trouble that came to me. But we needn?t
talk about that, need we? You can?t have it
a bed of roses ??
?Otto of roses,? interjected Toby, and there
was a general laugh at the sally.


a bed of roses,? continued Karl. ? I
want to think only of Compton Prior and you
fellows, and the masters, and the jolly times
we?ve had together. I know now what an
English school is like. It?s? it?s?it?s just??
he hesitated awkwardly, and Wenham again
sprang to the rescue.
? Say it in roses!? he cried, to the accom-
paniment of another burst of merriment.
Karl seized the interrupter by the neck and
shook him playfully. ? What I was going to
say, he said, ?is this: an English school is
the finest institution in the world for teaching
you to play the game, as you call it ?
So you do, old man!? from Parkyn; and a
? Well played, sir!? from Monty.
And when I go back home to Altburg,
to Cheritza ?
I 11 jolly well come and write your speeches
for you, Karl,? broke in Toby. ? You?re a
rotten spouter, old sportsman, and the night is
getting short. Lorry?s got bottles and bottles
of ginger-pop unopened, and tons of sand-
wiches and cakes. ? Cut the gag and come to
the osses!? Gentlemen, once more?three
cheers for His Serene Highness! ? ?


Wenham?s outburst was the signal for a
general relaxation of formalities. The party
resolved itself into a cheery, free-and-easy
gathering, and joke and reminiscence went
round the table as they talked over the doings
of the past term. There were to be no laments,
however much they regretted the coming de-
parture of one of their number. To-night they
were care-free and happy. ?On with the
dance, let joy be unconfined,? quoted Toby,
and they let themselves go as only healthy
schoolboys can.
Mr. Campion looked in later, before he left,
and sang a song, to the great delight of every-
one ?a rollicking hunting song with a chorus,
This inspired Monty to a cricketing lay, and
afterwards Karl gave them a plaintive Magyar
folk-song that held them very quiet till the last
note died away.
A still later arrival was the Badger, with a
message for Parkyn from his house-master.
The junior was greeted with a shout of wel-
come, Karl further embarrassing him by an
embrace.
? � Why can?t these foreigners drop that


mother-kiss-me silliness ?? grumbled the Badger
to his intimates, on his return to the Den.
?I?m going to send that youngster some-
thing,? ? remarked Karl, after the junior had
departed. ? Just a little souvenir of his de-
votion, you know. And that reminds me, you
fellows, 5 ' he added; ? I want you ?as many of
you as can come ?to spend a holiday with me
some time at Cheritza. Will you??
What ho! Will we not!? came the shout
in unison. ? Send the old Palace charabanc,
Karl, and we?re yours for the day!?
Karl was in the middle of a glowing account
of the festivities he intended preparing for them
on the occasion, when there came the sound of
several loud explosions. Lorrimer ran to the
below.
The Den?s broken loose!? he exclaimed.
All the juniors are having a grand firework
celebration. I hope they won?t scare old Atter-
bury out of his wits ! ? 5
The others crowded to his side and beheld a
number of figures which danced madly about
with squibs, crackers and other fireworks. A
rocket shot up into the air and burst amid a
shower of sparks.


Mr. Kirke, who thrust his head into the study
at this moment, supplied an explanation of this
phenomenon.
? I?ve given the youngsters leave for a little
show this evening,? he said. ?It seems that
some Secret Society?they call themselves the
Karlists, don?t they?is being disbanded. Bad-
gerley came to me with a special request to be
allowed a firework performance, so I got the
Head to consent. The young rascal had had a
whip round and laid in a stock. There they
go!?
As he spoke, the quadrangle echoed again to
the bursting of rockets and the sharp detonation
of squibs.
? I looked into the Den before I came up,?
continued the master, ? and I heard the Badger
holding forth to the others about the Society.
He said they had succeeded in their task; they
had placed you safely on the throne ?or what-
ever it was in Altburg that you were going back
to ?and that they jolly well ought to be proud
of themselves. You?re getting quite an ovation,
Karl.?
The Badger?s voice was heard at this moment
loudlv calling for ? Three cheers for every-


body!? And the hip-hip-hoorays that followed
gave evidence that the bright spirits of the
Junior School were determined to make this last
night a memorable one.
So, with excitement without, and fun and
feasting within, the evening passed. Never had
the Captain?s study in the School house con-
tained a merrier party. In addition to the
celebration in honour of the chief guest, there
the Captain?s study in the Schoolhouse con-
gratulation. Wenham had pulled off the Max-
well, and after another term would proceed to
Oxford. The ?Eecord? would thus have to wait
a little longer for his able assistance. Lorrimer
had captured the Elphinstone and the Gold
Medal for Classics. Both Parkyn and Copwick
had secured prizes. To Monty had fallen the
honour of the best batting score of the season.
They chipped each other about successes and
non-successes, and were very content with
life in general when the time came to break up.
? Only one fly in the ointment,? Toby had
remarked as he was congratulated on his ac-
complishment, ?My poor little fag hasn?t
collared the English Verse trophy. It?ll pretty
well break the Microbe?s heart, I know,? he


laughed, ? but I?ve promised to give him a
show in the ? Prior ? next term if he improves
his spelling.?
Then Lorrimer?s guests took themselves off to
their respective houses, where, to judge from
the sounds, ? last night ? celebrations were
still in full swing.
Karl was the last to leave, and the Captain
had a final handshake with his chum.
? You know what Toby would say,? he re-
marked, holding the other?s hand in his. ?No
sentiment, old man. So it?s just good-bye to
you, Karl?good-bye and good luck to you. We
shall miss you? all of us. But you won?t forget
Compton Prior and your pals here, I think. So
long! ? *
Karl returned the grip of Lorrimer?s hand.
? Good-bye, Paul,? he said simply.
And then, as from below there came an out-
burst of merriment and the strains of ?For
he?s a jolly good fellow!? he gave a laugh.
? That?s the right note to end on, Paul,? he
said. cc They?ve got it: c jolly good fellows !? ?
