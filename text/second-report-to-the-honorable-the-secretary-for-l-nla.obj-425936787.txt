INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS OF NEW SOUTH WALES.
(REPORT FROM CHIEF COMMISSIONER FOR RAILWAYS, &c. t &o.)
Second Report to The Honorable the Secretary for Lands and Public Works,
by Captain Martindalb, Royal Engineers.
Railway Department,
Sydney, 17 April, 1858.
I have the honor to submit, for the consideration of the Government, my
Second Report on the Railways, and other Public Works connected with the Internal
Communications, of the Colony.
Railways.
It must be considered as a matter of the first consequence, that the Railways of New.
South Wales should become, as early as possible, self-supporting,* not only on account of ne
relief that would thus be afforded to the Consolidated Revenue of the country, but also from
the impetus that would thus be given to further Extensions. ...
I have, therefore, carefully studied the past and present working of the existing lines,
in order to ascertain whether any causes hinder their prosperity, and, if such exist, to
surest measures for removing them. . ... , - ,
In the Tables contained in the Appendix to this Report will be found as complete
details of the present Railways as the records of the Department will afford, and these
furnish data for reasoning upon every point of importance connected with their present
conditioning future f wag experienced> in the very commencement of the inquiry, m
arriving at the exact cost of each line, owing to the charges for permanent way, rolling stock,
and other materials procured from England, not having been kept separate for eac ,
but a careful and very laborious comparison of the accounts with original vouchers and
Papers and the aum/gweo in Table 1 may be relied upon as bemg as close
«Mr Locke M P President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, in a most interesting paper
read at S SL * January last, speaks to the following

an approximation to the expense of each length of Railway that has been made, as the
records of the Department will afford.
The entire expenditure upon the Government Railways to the 31st December, 1857,
was, therefore, £1,866,395 3s. Id., of which sum there was spent—upon the Southern
Line, £942,634 175.; upon the Northern Line, £366,514 3s. 3d.; and for stores in stock,
on voyage, or by remittances to England, £57,246 2s. lOd.
Of the sum expended upon the Southern Line, £795,875 4s. sd. is charged against
the line from Sydney to Parramatta, £124,888 19s. 6d. against the line from Parramatta
to Liverpool, and £21,870 13s. Id. to the Campbelltown line; but of the first sum
£58,649 Is. lid. was spent for rolling stock, £35,332 19s. Id. upon the Darling Harbour
Branch, (76 chains in length), £15,142 13s. 7d. for permanent way materials in store at
the end of the year, and £19,057 Os. Id. for stores for the general working of the lines,
the value of which is gradually repaid to capital by revenue as the stores are used. If these
sums be deducted from the gross amount of £795,875 4s. 5d., the cost of the line from
Sydney to Parramatta, miles in length, is £667,693 9s. 9d., or £49,458-7 per mile, for
a double line throughout. In this amount is included the entire cost of the workshops,
machinery, and store-houses at Sydney, the use of which is common to the whole of the
lines, although the cost cannot be separated from that of the construction of the main
line to Parramatta.
The cost per mile of the line from Parramatta to Liverpool, 8-1 miles long, is
£14,692-8, the line being single, with double-way works.
The average cost per mile of the whole line, including the Darling Harbour Branch,
is £35,996-3. This amount is exclusive of any outstanding claims for land.
The gross receipts of the line between Sydney and Parramatta, from the 26th
September, 1855, the date of opening, to the Ist September, 1856, when the extension to
Liverpool was opened, were £28,589 12s. 4d., and the gross expenditure £17,817 2s. 4d.,
the proportion per cent, of expenditure to receipts being therefore 62-3, and the net receipts
£10,772 10s., giving interest at the rate of 1-35 per cent, per annum on £851,612 195.,
the capital invested up to the 31st December, 1856, in the construction of the Great
Southern Line.*
From the opening of the Extension to Liverpool to the 31st December, 1856, the
gross receipts were £12,928 14s. lOd.; the gross expenditure £9,930 Is.; the net receipts
£2,998 13s. 10d.; the proportion of expenditure to receipts 76-8 per cent.; and the interest
on £851,612 19s. was -35 per cent, on the four months, or at the rate of 1-05 per cent,
per annum.
During the year 1857 the gross receipts were £38,935 2s. 2d.; the gross expenditure
£28,386 12s. sd, the net receipts £10,548 9s. 9d.; the proportion of expenditure to
receipts 72-9 per cent., and the interest on £905,621 10s. 4d., the capital invested up to
the 31st December, 1857, on the line to Liverpool, to I*l6 per cent per annum.f
The details from which these results have been obtained will be found in Tables 1 and 4.
If the above statements represented the probable permanent condition of the Great
Southern Railway, it would have to be considered as a failure in a financial point of view;
such, however, is not the case.
The first quarter of the present year shews a marked improvement: the gross
receipts for the three months ending the 31st ultimo have amounted to £12,379 os. 7d.;
the gross expenditure has been £7,626 6s. 7d.; the proportion of expenditure to receipts,
61-6 per cent.; the net receipts £4,752 145., giving interest at the rate of -524 on the
quarter, or 2-096 per cent, per annum on £905,621 10s. 4d.| as above.
Of the gross receipts in the last quarter, however, about £940 arose from traffic
connected with the present extensions; and if, in order not to over-rate any improvement,
the proportionate per centage amount be deducted from the net receipts, the balance will
*Of this sum about £lOO,OOO was expended upon the Liverpool Line; if this he deducted the
interest will be at the rate of 1-5 per cent, per annum.
tlf to this sum he added £21,870 13s. Id., expended upon the Campbelltown Line, and
£15,142 13s. 7d. for permanent way materials in store, making £942,634 175., and also £57,246 2s. lOd.
for materials ordered from England, the rate of interest would be reduced to I'os per cent, per annum.
Including the Great Northern Railway, the net receipts from all sources, for the nine months
ending 31st December, 1857, were £9,868 16s. 7d., giving interest at the rate of -902 per cent, per
annum on £1,366,395 3s. Id-, the total capital invested up to that date on Government Railways. 0
1 If to this sum be added the same amounts as before, the total will be £999,880 19s. 10d., and
the rate of interest will be reduced to 1-9.


be £4,451 14s. 10d., and the interest will amount to 196 per cent, per annum on the
same sum, or, in round numbers, 2 per cent.*
It is, as a rule, hazardous to reason on the results of a short period of time; yet, as it
appears that the increase in receipts arises mainly from a growing appreciation, on the part
of the public, of the convenience of communication by Eailway, and from the increased
recent arrangements have afforded for using the Railway ; and that the diminution
in expenditure is caused by the retrenchments that experience enables the department to
effect; it may be anticipated the improvement will be permanent.
Considerable as this improvement is, it is not sufficient, by any means, to render the
Railway self-supporting, and the question arises whether any causes exist that hinder the
prosperity of the Railway, and of the measures that should be adopted for their removal.
Three principal causes may be named :
Ist. The Situation of the Terminal Station at Sydney.
2nd. The Present Fares.
3rd. The Short Length of the Line.
The Station at Redpern.
In my first Report I alluded to the inconvenience to the public of the distance to the
present terminus at Redfern, an inconvenience which unquestionably operates prejudicially
upon the success of the Railway, and I drew attention to the construction of a tramway from
Redfern to Sydney Cove as a simple and inexpensive remedy.
I have since laid before the Government! a plan, section, and estimate for this work,
and I submit it as one of the measures that should be adopted to promote the prosperity of
the Railway in adding to the public convenience.
A project has also been brought under my consideration to extend the Darling
Harbour Branch to the Pyrmont Bridge, and to erect a Station at the Bridge. lam unable
to recommend that this should be carried out at the public expense ; but, should the
Directors consider that the advantages to their Company would prove sufficient to warrant the
project being carried out by the Company, I am of opinion that every facility should be
afforded them necessary for the extension of the line, and liberal terms made with them as
regards the working of the line when completed.
The present Fares.
For a Railway to succeed financially its charges must be just on the one hand to the'
public who use the line, and on the other to those by whose funds the line has been con-
structed, and is worked and maintained. In New South Wales both these classes consist of
the general public, the benefit enjoyed by each portion of the community being in direct
proportion to its vicinity to the Railway, a circumstance which materially adds to the
importance of each line of Railway being self-supporting, and strengthens the necessity for a
just scale of charges.
The question of the fares to be charged is one always attended with some difficulties,
and especially in a new country. It has received my earnest consideration, and is of such
importance as to induce me to request especial attention to it.
In Table 8 will be found the alterations that have been made in the fares and rates of
the Great Southern Railway at various times; in Table 7 the changes in the running of
trains; Table 6 contains the number of passengers carried and the receipts from passenger
traffic, arranged in periods in accordance with the alterations in fares; and Tables 13 to 21
shew in detail the passenger traffic between each station, arranged in similar periods.
It will be seen from these Tables that between the 26th September, 1855, and the
30th April, 1857, the fares were altered six times, the first class fare varying from 6d. to 3d.
* The net Receipts for the quarter, including the Great Northern Eailway, were £6,435 4s. 5d.,
giving interest at the rate of FBB per cent, per annum on £1,366,395 3s. Id.; deducting, however,
£3OO 9s. 2d. from the Great Southern Eailway, as above, and £643, as being derived from temporary
sources on the Great Northern Eailway, the interest on the above sum would be at the rate of 1-6 per
cent, per annum. ,
t Among others may be named the arrangements for the collection and delivery of goods, pub-
lished 28 December, 1857, and the simplification effected by the revised scale of classes and rates for
the conveyance of goods, published on the 13th February, 1858.
t A copy of my letter, dated 8 March, 1858, will be found in the Appendix, marked A.


• It is worthy of remark, that the number appears to have obtained its maximum for a time, and
that a decrease rather than increase may be expected. Such an event as the cessation of the influx
of Chinese would sensibly affect the numbers and the Railway receipts,
t In 1856 the passenger traffic was as follows, from Sydney
1st Class. 2nd Class. 3rd Class,
April 1,460 1,387 11.819
May 1,902 2,288 13,278
June 1,607 1,834 11,661
per mile, and the mean from 4d. to 8-85 d. ; the second class varying from 4-sd. to 2d.; and
the mean from 3-2 d. to 2-69 d.; and the third class from 3d to D3d. and the mean from
219 d. to 172 d.
On the 30th April, 1857, the first class fares varied from 5-6 d. to 3-sd. per mile, the
mean being 4 - 34 d.; the second class fares from 42d. to 3d., the mean being 32d.; the third
from 2-82 d. to D77d,, the mean being 219 d.; and the mean of the whole being 3-24 d.
These rates had then been in existence for seven months.
On the Ist May, 1857, the fares were altered to rates varying from 3-3 d. to 2-6 d. for
the first class, the mean being 2-98 d. per mile; from 2'4Bd. to 2d. for the second class, the
mean being 2-29 d.; from DB4d. to L4ld. for the third class, the mean being D56d., and the
mean of the whole 2-28 d.; and these rates continued unaltered to the end of the year, a
period of eight months.
The reduction thus effected was about 3L4 per cent, on first class fares; about 28‘5
per cent, on second class fares; and about 28‘8 per cent, on third class fares; and 29 5 per
cent, on the mean of the whole, or, in round numbers, 30 per cent.
The average number of passengers per month during the first seven months was
20,085, and during the next eight months 28,036; the average receipts, (including special
trains and season tickets), £2,462 in the first case, and £2,403 in the second case, per month.
The increase in passengers carried therefore was 39-5 per cent., and the decrease in actual
receipts, 24 per cent. _ ... _ .
It is necessary now to examine how much of this increase in passenger traffic must be
considered as due to the lowering of the rates, and how much to an increased appreciation
on the part of the public of the advantages of railway travelling and other causes.
Table 22 contains a summary of the passengers from the three principal stations —
Sydney, Parramatta, and Liverpool —for each month from October, 1856, to April, 1857, and
from April to December, 1857.* ,
If we except from consideration the month of May, in which the Homebush Races
are held, and in which a larger number of persons are usually conveyed by rail,| the incon
siderable increase in the passenger traffic for the first four months after the fares were reduced
is very ln the month of September, during which the Liverpool Races are held,
there is a large increase; and this is maintained to the encLof the year.
About the middle of September the Traffic Department was, after examination,
reorganized by the Commissioners.
It must be considered that had the rates existing in April exercised a paramount
influence in deterring travellers from using the Railway, the increase in passenger traffic
would have shewn itself more decidedly in the first four months, and therefore that a large
amount of the increase is due to a greater appreciation by the public of the convenience of
travelling by Railway, increasing communication between Sydney and the interior, and
additional attention to the wants and convenience of the public.
Some allowance should, perhaps, be made for June, July, and August, being winter
months * but it will probably be giving full value to the effect of the reduction in fares if it
be allowed that it induced 4,000 additional persons per month to travel by Railway.
It follows therefore, that the remaining 4,000 would, in any case, have travelled at
the rates fixed in April.
From Tables 13 to 21 it may be found that the number of each class of passengers
travelling during the eight months ending 31st December, 1857, was 1,324 first class, 2,874

second class, and 18,323 third class, and the average mileage travelled by each class 11*773,
11-828, and 10-364 miles,* the mean fare being 2*98, 2-31, and 1-56 pence per mile.
Assuming that the additional 4,000 passengers per month would have contained the
same proportion of each class, and travelled the same average mileage, the increase to Railway
receipts, had the April rates been maintained, would have been at the rate of £477 Os. 3d.f
in place of the loss of £59 per month, which has followed the reduction.
This, however, does not represent the entire question.
Horses, carriages, and dogs, are conveyed by passenger trains; and it will be seen on
reference to Table 11, that there has been a considerable increase in this description of traffic,
the average number conveyed for the first seven months being 74 carriages, 254 horses, and
144 dogs per month, at a cost of £125 Is. 10d., and for the latter eight months 88 carriages,
323 horses, and 151 dogs per month, at a cost of £163 4s. 10d., the increase per cent, in
receipts being 30-5, the rates having remained unaltered.
It is fair to presume that one-half of this increased traffic arose from the additional
passenger traffic caused by the reduction in rates, and the sum of £l9 Is. 6d. per month
must therefore be deducted from the loss occasioned by that reduction.
On the other hand, the conveyance of so many additional passengers necessarily
occasioned an increase in the working expenses of the Railway, during the latter eight
months; and on reference to Table 6it will be seen that the expenditure per train mile
run was, in the first period, 7s. 103 d., and in the second, 95.; that the proportion of
expenditure to receipts, upon passengers only, was 76 per cent, in the first period, and 89 9
in the second; and including horses, carriages, and dogs, 72-5 per cent, in the first, as com-
pared with 84-2 per cent, in the second; the expenditure upon all services being 74-5 per
cent, in the first, as compared with 75-5 per cent, in the second period.
* These numbers are the average numbers per month, exclusive of return tickets and season
tickets. The accompanying Table is interesting also as shewing the comparative working of each
station.

t The general proportion of each class of passengers being in the ratio of 6*2, 10"6, and 83"2, the
numbers conveyed would be about 248 first class, 424 2nd class, and 3,328 3rd class, of whom about
one-fifth would be return and season tickets. The figures are therefore as follows:

It would not, however, be just, to charge the entire of this increased expenditure per
train mile run to the increase in passenger traffic. It will probably be sufficient to place it
at something less than one-half, or 6d. per train mile run, or £l5B 16s. per month.
It results, therefore, that the entire loss of revenue to the Railway caused by the
reduction in fares may be estimated at £596 6s. 9d. per month.*
It is financially wrong that a Railway should carry 8,000 passengers more per month
and lose by it ; and in the case of Government Railways it is socially wrong, unless it can
be shewn that the conveyance by Railway of these additional passengers confers such benefits
upon the country generally that the community at large should pay for it.
I must not be understood as blaming the experiment; it was a fair one to make, and
was understood, I believe, at the time to be an experiment; and may yet, by having
stimulated the taste for travelling by Railway, contribute ultimately to their financial pros-
perity. At the same time, I have no doubt the rates require adjustment, and it remains to
consider what they ought to be.
In the Mother Country, the lowest rate at which companies are compelled by Act of
Parliament to carry passengers is Id. per mile, while the price of laborj" is not more than
one-third of the price in this Colony,
The trains by which passengers are conveyed at this rate, (and which are usually
called Parliamentary Trains,) are run by the companies at such hours as are found most
convenient in reference to the more profitable traffic ) and to a large proportion of the
passenger trains no third class carriages are attached at all. Here the public have the option
of travelling by third class with every train.
Even under the disadvantages of the English system, and of the cold and wet of the
English climate, a considerable majority of the passengers travel third class ; and to many
this is a matter of absolute necessity, from the miserable wages they receive. Here, where
the genial character of the climate greatly diminishes any inconveniences arising from
travelling third class, and where every facility is afforded for so doing, it is no matter of
surprise that a still larger majority are induced by the very low charge to do so. In
England, the per-centage proportion of passengers conveyed in 1856 was 13-30 first class,
32-75 second class, 53 92 third class, and -03 miscellaneous; and the per-centage proportion
of receipts was, 30-10 for first class, 35-00 for second and 32-79 for third class pas-
sengers ; the average fares being respectively 2-07 d., 1*44d., and *B3d. per mile, the ordinary
third class fare being reduced by the large amount of excursion traffic. J
In this Colony, the per-centage proportion of passengers conveyed during the eight
months ending 31st December, 1857, was only 6-2 first class, only 10-6 second class, and the
astonishing proportion of 83-2 third class; and the per-centage proportion of receipts, 10-9
for first class, 15"3 for second class, and <3-8 for third class. _ _
When the difference in the per-centage proportion of each class travelling in the two
countries is taken into consideration, it will be found that the mean Railway fare per mile
paid by this country at present does not exceed that paid in England by more than 52 per cent.

I am of opinion, after considering the rate of wages and the cost of the necessaries of
life in the two countries, and also the cost of labor and materials necessary for the working
of the Railway, that the minimum charge in this Colony should not he less than double that
fixed by the Parliament in England, or 2d. per mile.
Although the point is one of less importance, I have felt, perhaps, more difficulty in
arriving at a conclusion upon the higher rates. It is evident that a moderate increase upon
the minimum rate is sufficient to cover any expense incurred in affording the superior accom-
modation enjoyed, and that any considerable increase tends only to drive travellers into the
third class. I consider per mile for the first, and 3d. for the second class should be the
rate adopted.
The revised scale would, therefore, stand between that of April, 1357, and the reduced
scale of May, 1857, as follows:
Ist Class. 2nd Class. 3rd Class. Mean.
Upon this scale I have framed the rates to come into force on the opening of the
extension to Campbell town, which I shall have the honor to submit immediately for the
consideration of the Government.
It must be observed that the public enjoy one advantage in the Railways of this
Colony being public property, which they would not possess were the Railways in the hands
of a company, viz., that as soon as they become self-supporting the rates can be lowered.
It may possibly be supposed by some that the proposed increase in rates, however
moderate, will prove burdensome to that portion of the public using the Railway; this is a
point very necessary to be considered.
By an examination of Tables 13 to 21, it has been found that the average mileage
travelled by each first class passenger from the Ist May, 1857, to the 31st December, 1857,
was 11773 miles; by each second class passenger was 11-828 miles, and by each third class
passenger was 10 364 miles; and if we assume that each passenger, not being a season ticket
holder, travels upon the line ten times in each year, the entire annual amount each passenger
would pay under the revised, as compared with the present rates, would be, of the first class
412 05 pence in place of 350-83, or an increase of 61-22 pence per annum; of the second
class 354-84 pence in place of 270-86, or an increase of 84 pence per annum; of the third
class 207-28 pence in place of 161-67 pence, or an increase of 45-6 per annum, an increase in
each case that could not be sensibly felt by any person in this Colony, but that would make
a considerable difference in the revenue gained for the public by the Railways *
It is necessary, before closing this subject, to draw attention to the system of season
tickets established in this Colony,
Season tickets are issued upon any day for a quarter of a year at a time, and for first,
second, and third class passengers.
• The figures stand as follows :

£1,013,621 0 0
In England third class season tickets are unknown; but by reference to Table 12 it
will be seen that here, out of 1,119 season tickets taken between the opening of the line and
the 81st December last, 1,035 were third class, only 39 first, and 45 second, having been
issued.
This is not surprising when it is considered that by means of a third class season
ticket a passenger using the line once a day each way now travels at the rate of per
mile. # .
It might inconvenience a considerable number of persons to decline to issue third
class season tickets in future at the same time it is just that those who derive such great
advantages from the Railway should contribute their fair share towards its working expenses.
I am of opinion that only two classes of season tickets should be issued, viz., first and
third, the first being calculated at the rate of per mile, and the third at the rate of Id.
per mile.
Thus for 4d. a day the holder of a third class season ticket, and for 6d. a day of a
first class season ticket, would travel between Newtown and Sydney. _
Under the system of issuing season tickets from day to day, it is difficult to establish
a plan by which the collectors of tickets may know precisely the date when each season
ticket expires. I propose, therefore, after the 30th instant, to issue season tickets only on
the Ist day of each month, and for one month only at a time, as I have reason to believe
that monthly in place of quarterly season tickets would prove a convenience to many
persons.
The question has been submitted whether a season ticket entitles the holder to travel
free between intermediate stations. lam of opinion that he is only entitled to travel free
between the two stations named upon the ticket, and that on this condition only season
tickets should be issued. #
The great importance of the question will, I trust, be sufficient apology for the length
at which I have discussed the prejudicial influence of the present rates on the prosperity of
the Railway, and recommended as a remedy their revision.
Effect of the Short Length op Line.
The last cause to which I have to direct attention as hindering the financial success
of the Railway between Sydney and Liverpool, is its short length.
As a general rule, the shorter the line the heavier will be the working expenses,
including direction and management; but the ill effect in the present instance is chiefly felt in
the goods traffic. For it must be expected that a large majority of the men who bring their
drays hundreds of miles from the west or south will not care to unload them when within
ten or twenty miles of Sydney, in order to send their goods by rail, especially in summer
time, when the roads are good.
It is, therefore, a matter of congratulation that there is a steady, though not rapid,
increase in the transport of goods by rail, and I anticipate that the facilities recently afforded*
to the public will assist in promoting it. The great hope, however, of a large and remune-
rative goods traffic consists in judicious extensions.
Effect of the Extension to Campbelltown.
The line between Liverpool and Campbelltown, 12 miles in length, will be opened in
a few days j its probable effect upon the revenue of the Southern Railway may first be
considered.
The cost of this extension will, owing to the care and skill of the Engineer-in-Chief,j"
not exceed £7,000 per mile, exclusive of land and rolling stock, and the entire cost will,
I anticipate, not be more than £9,000 per mile. _
I estimate the gross receipts of the Southern Line for the year 1809, at £75,000 ]
the gross expenditure at £40,800, the proportion of expenditure to receipts at 54-4 per cent. ;
the net receipts at £34,200, and the rate of interest at 3-37 on £1,013,621,1 or nearly
per cent, on the total capital invested on the Great Southern Line.


The passenger receipts 'are calculated on the revised rates, and it is assumed the
present goods traffic will double within the year. The detailed statement of the estima
will be Extension may, therefore, be considered as likely to prove finan-
cially llQweverj in order to facilitate the transit of goods by the line to
improve the condition of the direct road from the Cowpasture Road to Lampbelltown, and
to this I shall have the honor to request your attention later.
A large increase in passenger traffic can scarcely be expected; but must be dependent
on the growth of population and the further settlement of the country. Indeed some time
must always be allowed for the development of the traffic of any newly opened line, whether
passenger or goods.
Comparison between Railways in the Mother Country and in New South Wales.
It may be useful, before entering into the question of further Railway
compare the original cost and present receipts and expenditure of the Great Southern Rail-
wav with those of Railways in the Mother Country.
The cost of Railways in England has averaged £40,288 per mile, in Scotland £27,750,
and in Ireland £14,808; but the average cost of the lines for which Acts have been obtained
since 1848, has only been £12,273 per mile in England, £5,408 per mile in Scotland,
and P® gt of the Une f 0 p arrama tta has already been stated at £49,458-7 per mile,
from Parramatta to Liverpool at £14,692-8 per mile, and to C a
mile, exclusive of outstanding charges for land; the average cost of the whole per mile being
' When the price of labor in this Colony is considered, the extra charges for freight
upon materials from England, and the difficulties and consequently increased expense
attendant upon the construction of large works in a new country, it will be admitted t a
the cost at which Railway works in this Colony are now being constructed will bear a very
favorable comparison with the cost of those lately made in the Mother Country, and is such
as to present no serious obstacle to further Railway extensions. £f) r .
1 The receipts in England in the year 1849 for 4365*5 miles of Railway were £2,345 ,
and in 1856 for 6,332 miles opened were £3 120 per mile per annum. ; Scotland in the
year 1849, the receipts were £1,498 on 790*6 miles open, m 18Mon
miles- in Ireland, £975 per mile on 428-5 miles in 1849; and £1,092 on 102 d miles in
1856 • the average for Great Britain and Ireland being £2,115 per mile on 55/9-5 miles
onen in 1849 ; and £2,724 per mile on 8502 miles in 1856. _ .
The average working expenses per mile of Railway open in 1806 were in Eng a d
and Wales £1,531, in Scotland £970, and in Ireland £427.
The proportion per cent, of expenditure to receipts in the year 1856 varied from 9-
to 26 ner cent *the mean being 49 per cent, in England; from 68 to 42, the mean being 7

Kailway, the proportion per cent, of expenditure to receipts should here be only * GI G as
compared with 49 in England, must be considered as highly satisfactory ; and these facts,
coupled with that of the reduction in the cost of Railway construction, are perhaps the best
refutation that can be given to the inconsiderate statements that are sometimes made relative
to Government management of Railways.
If the comparison be further pursued, by taking the effect of the Campbelltown
extension into consideration, the result will be still more favorable to the Colony ; and it will
be conceded that in these comparisons there is nothing to discourage further Railway
extensions in this country.
The permanent-way materials in store on the 31st December, 1857, amounting in value
to £15,142 13s. 7d, at Sydney, and £17,065 10s. 6d. at Newcastle, are not included in the
sum upon which the lines opened should pay interest, as they are not required for these lines,
but they furnish a reason for further extension, as the capital invested in them is now
lying dead.
Effect op Extensions to Penrith and Picton.
In the Estimates now before Parliament, it is proposed to extend to Penrith to the
westward, and Picton to the south.
The estimate for the line to Penrith, including land and rolling stock, is £233,000,
or £10,0712 per mile, the distance being 21-75 miles j and the estimate for the line to
Picton, including land and rolling stock, and allowing £15,000 for a bridge across the
Nepean, at Menangle, is £274,000, or £13,200 per mile, the distance being 20 miles.
It is not possible to state with certainty what the financial result of these extensions
will be, but from Table 24 it will be seen that I estimate the gross receipts of the Southern
Line, including the extension to Penrith, but exclusive of that to Picton, at £130,000 a year,
the gross expenditure at £66,900 a year, the proportion of expenditure to receipts at 5M
per cent., the net receipts at £63,100, and the interest at the rate of 5 05 on £1,246,621.|
I estimate the gross receipts of the Southern Line, including the extension to Picton,
but exclusive of that to Penrith, at £llO,OOO, the gross expenditure at £64,800, the propor-
tion of expenditure to receipts at 58-9 per cent., the net receipts at £46,200, and the interest
at the rate of 3 - 58 on £1,287,621. J
If both of these extensions be supposed constructed and opened, their joint effect on
the Great Southern Railway would be to reduce the mean cost of construction to £20,074-2 §
per mile, the proportion of expenditure to receipts to 54-7 per cent., and the rate of interest
upon the total capital to 4-66 per cent, per annum.
If, therefore, the data upon which the above estimates are made be considered as
sufficiently reliable, the extensions proposed for the Great Southern Railway would render it
self-supporting. Its present condition admits of favorable comparison with the Railways of
the Mother Country; and neither in its past cost, present working, nor future prospects, is
there anything sufficient to prevent such hinderances to its prosperity, as arise from the short
length of line at present open, being removed by the construction of judicious extensions.

In my first Report, dated'2lst August, 1857, I ventured to give as strong a recom-
mendation as I felt my short residence in the Colony justified, that the extensions towards
Penrith and Picton should be proceeded with ; and I have now only to repeat that recom-
mendation. , ~ , ,
In so doing, however, I must advert to the fact, to which I shall have the honor later
more particularly to request attention, that the best line of country to connect Bathurst with
Sydney by rail is not yet determined.
It is necessary, also, that I should draw attention to the high price* asked for land
taken and for severance. This forms so serious an item in Railway expenditure in this
Colony as to render it advisable for the Government, in all future sales of land, to provide
for securing so much as may be necessary for the construction of Railways, or other means
of internal communication, upon more reasonable terms as compared with the price originally
paid for the land; nor will this entail hardship upon individual owners, since it will be
admitted that the advantages arising from the passage of a Railway through the land in any
country, and especially in a new country, are in themselves a great compensation for the
small portion taken for its construction.
The Great Northern Railway.
I have now the honor to request consideration to the Great Northern Railway, of
which I have hitherto avoided almost all mention, for the sake of greater simplicity in
reasoning upon the facts I have thus far submitted.
The cost of the line from Honeysuckle Point to East Maitland, up to the 31st Decem-
ber, 1857, has been £305,200 13s. 9d., or £18,497 per mile, the distance being 16 5 miles.-f
In this amount is included the entire cost of the workshops, machinery, and store-
houses at Honeysuckle Point, the advantages of which will be shared equally with the
present line by all future extensions. It is exclusive, however, of outstanding claims for
land, and surplus stores procured from England, and now in stock.
This line was only opened on the 30th March, 1857 j the gross receipts for the
nine months ending the 31st Decemher last were £4,451 9s. 5d. ) the gross expenditure
£2,963 11s. 7d.; the proportion per cent, of expenditure to receipts being, therefore, 66-5
per cent ; and the net receipts £1,487 17s. 10d., giving interest at the rate of 64 per cent,
per annum on the capital invested.
The returns for the first quarter of the present year appear somewhat more favorable;
the gross receipts for the three months ending 31st ultimo having amounted to £2,682 11s. Bd.,
and the proportion of expenditure to receipts to 37 - 2 per cent.
It must be observed, however, that of these gross receipts £643 ss. were derived from
sources which cannot be regarded as permanent j the way and works also were maintained
by the contractor under his contract until the middle of March, and this additional expense
is now a charge upon the Railway receipts.
If the amount necessary for maintenance of way be added to the gross expenditure
of the last quarter, and the amount derived from temporary sources be deducted from'the
gross receipts, the working expenses would absorb the entire revenue.
This Railway has labored not only under the disadvantages the Southern Railway
has suffered from, but under two others of, at least, equal importance j it has no extensive
population at either terminus, and it has to contend with steamers in direct communication
with Sydney at one end, and with Morpeth at the other, —a town situated on a river always
navigable, and within three or four miles of the terminus at Maitland.
There are, however, extensive coal fields in the neighborhood of Newcastle, and from
these, I am informed, it has always been anticipated a very large share of the traffic upon
this line would arise; but until proper wharves and appliances for shipping the coal have
been constructed at Newcastle, it cannot be expected that these anticipations will be realized.
An extension, 67 chains in length, from Honeysuckle Point into Newcastle was
opened on the 19th ultimo. A very inconvenient curve and dip have necessarily been made
* A value at the rate of £28,000 per acre has in one case been suggested. It is just, however,
to add that many claims are reasonable.
t Of the sum of £366,514 3s. 3d. expended upon the Northern Line to the 31st Decemher, 1857,
£3,998 Is. sd. is to he charged against the extension to West Maitland, £39,288 4s. Id. to rolling stock,
£17,065 10s. 6d. for permanent way materials in store, and £961 13s. 6d. for stores for the working of the line.
The Northern Line between Honeysuckle Point and East Maitland is a single line with double
way works.

in this line, in order to enable the trains to pass under the bridge upon which the tramway
of the Australian Agricultural Company crosses the Maitland Road ; but, I understand the
Company contemplate the removal of this bridge as early as possible, after which the direct
course of the line will be restored.
The attention of the Government has already been drawn to the fact of the Coal and
Copper Company crossing this line with a locomotive on the level.
This extension has afforded that advantage to Newcastle which I propose to provide
for Sydney by the construction of the tramway from Redfern to Sydney Cove,
Upon the subject of fares I need here only remark they should be equal upon both
Railways.
However great the disadvantage of the short length of its line may be to the Southern
Railway, the prejudicial effect of the same cause upon the prosperity of the Northern has
been even greater. It is not to be expected that carriers will travel from West to East
Maitland, for the sake of sending their goods 17 miles by Railway to Newcastle, to be there
shipped on board the steamer, when they can ship them direct at Morpeth.
Great progress has been made in the extension from East to West Maitland, a distance
of 2 miles 67 chains, and I anticipate this length will be opened about the middle of the year.
There are some facts in the history of this short line too instructive to be passed over
in silence.
Tenders were called for, as usual, by public competition, and three were received.
The lowest was from a party who was considered incompetent, and who, subsequent events
have shewn, would have proved incompetent. The second was from the present contractor;
and it being known that he had executed large Railway works in England, and his security
for the execution of the work being good, it was, as a matter of course, given to him. The
result will be a delay of some months in the opening of the line; and, had the work in the
middle been taken from the contractor and given to another, supposing even that another
willing and competent could have been found to take up a broken contract, the delay would
have been as great, or greater, and the expense at the same time increased.
These facts merely strengthen an opinion formed after considerable experience,—that
open competition by tender for large public works is not advantageous to the public service,
especially in a new country, and should not be resorted to. In following the customs of
other countries the chief thing to be regarded is not -the customs themselves, but the
principles upon which they are founded.
The dam across Wallis’ Creek, and the diversion of its waters into the Hunter by
another channel, and a deep cutting at East Maitland render the works upon the Maitland
extension heavier than usual in this country.
I do not propose to trouble the Government with calculations of the effect these short
extensions may be expected to produce upon the Great Northern Railway, similar to those
I have submitted in the case of the extension to Campbelltown. It may be expected that
the greater facilities the inhabitants of West Maitland will possess for travelling will lead to
an increase in the number of passengers; but lam apprehensive no very marked difference
will be found in the goods traffic; for the man who has travelled his hundreds of miles will
think little of the extra three or four to Morpeth.
The paramount importance of considerable extension for the success of the Northern
Railway is apparent; the only question is, how far will such extension pay ?
In the Estimates now before Parliament, provision is made to extend as far as
Singleton, a distance of 27-g miles, the estimated cost being £312,000, or £11,192 per mile.
Referring to Table 24, it will be seen that I estimate the gross receipts of the Great
Northern Line, including the extension to Singleton at £BO,OOO, the gross expenditure at
£57,600, the proportion of expenditure to receipts at 72 per cent., the net receipts at
£22,400, and the interest at the rate of 3-06 per cent, per annum, or £731,448 12s. 9d,*
(a) Exclusive of £17,065 10s. 6d. for permanent way materia's in store on the 31st December last.


These calculations are founded upon the working of the present Southern Railway,
and the data made use of in my first Report, upon which too much reliance must no be
idaced Rut as the entire traffic of the rich Northern District passes through Singleton, it is
reasonable to suppose that when the Railway reaches that point it will m time become
ecmallv with the Western and Southern Lines self-supporting^
1 It is worthy of notice, that the “general experience of Belgian Railways shows that
« whatever may be the amount of traffic on any line in the first year of its compete opening,
“ that amount is doubled in about five years.”*
In mv previous Report I recommended the construction of the Northern extension
then proposed, viz., a length of 18* miles towards Singleton; and Iconsider it necessary that
the entire length of 27| miles from Maitland to Singleton should be constructed, if this
Railway is to become in time financially successful. \ ,
It will be seen that I have discussed the subject of further extensions quite inde-
pendently of the vast social advantages that may be anticipated from their construction.
Means by which other Countries have constructed Railways,
I propose next to consider by what means the country can most advantageously carry
out these extensions, It will be useful to see what has been done in other countries.
In England, Railways have been entirely constructed by Companies, the Govern-
ment exercising a certain limited control. For this purpose, every Railway Bill is m the
first instance submitted to the Board of Trade, who furnish a Report to the Select Committee
of the House appointed to report upon it. When Parliament has sanctioned the line, and
when it has been constructed, the works are inspected by an officer of the Board of Trade,f
and should the Board consider from his Report that the condition of the line is not satis-
factory, they have the power of deferring the opening for public traffic from time to time at
pleasure, until a satisfactory report is received. They retain also a power of inspection
of the English system of construction by companies have been
immense convenience and advantage to the public who use, and inadequate profit to those
who have constructed the Railways, a result arising principally from competing lines, the
onerous charges of the Parliamentary proceedings, the heavy cost of the viaducts, tunnels,
and other expensive works, and the exactions of land owners, and other interested parties.
In the United States,§ Railways have been constructed under four different
arrangements.
Ist. By the State. , , , c . . ,
2nd. By a company, to whose shares, capital, or mortgage debt the State has
contributed, retaining an interest in the line, and some power of interference.
3rd. By a company, to whom lauds have been granted, but which otherwise has
not been interfered with. ,
4th. By a company, unassisted, and therefore not interfered with.
Ist The Railways made by the State have not been successful, the officers appointed
to manage‘them having been chosen by universal suffrage, sometimes triennially, sometimes
annually, and rather for political reasons than as being specially qualified for the duty.
2nd. The State and Municipal Corporations have, in several instances, given assistance
to Railway Companies, the State or Corporation appointing directors in proportion to the
amount contributed; but as these directors are generally elected by universal suffrage for
short periods, they often desire to regulate the management of the Railway more with
reference to local political objects than to its interests as a commercial speculation.
3rd. The system of granting lands to induce a company to construct a is
resorted to in the Western States with remarkable success; the Railway Company being
allowed to take in addition to the actual land required for the line a specified quantity in
alternate lots of one square mile each on each side within a certain distance from the line.
The State in granting the land generally reserves a per centage on the gross receipts
of the company. Intone case in which this plan has proved highly successful, this amount

is 7 per cent., the line running however for the greater part of its course through prairie
land without trees, land, which with a small expenditure of labor, produces most luxuriant
crops.
4th. A large number of Railways have been constructed by unassisted companies;
and, in considering this fact in connexion with the rapid growth of Railways in the United
States, the recent financial panic should not be lost sight of.
In a majority of States, general Railway laws have been passed, enabling corpora-
tions to be formed for making Railways, the course of which is to be approved by Railway
Commissioners, or some executive authority.
Almost all Railway Companies are required to furnish annually detailed statements
shewing the financial condition and working of the line; but this information is not usually
made public.
A power of inspection of existing Railways by Government Officers is reserved in
some States, as in Connecticut and New York, the expenses of the department being defrayed
by the companies.
The New York Act is founded upon the same principles as the English Railway law,
viz., that a Railway shall not be opened until in the opinion of a Government department
it is ready to receive traffic safely, but that after the line has once been opened the State
retains no power over it, except that of inspection. But the New York Legislature has
made this power of inspection a reality, instead of its being nearly nominal, as in England. The
Railroad Commissioners of New York have full power to inquire into the financial position of
Railway Companies, and to publish such inquiries; they have also full power to inquire
into the cause of accidents, and to make suggestions, and if these suggestions are not attended
to, it is their duty to report the fact to the Legislature.
The profits in the Western States are higher than in the Eastern, where they do not
bear a very different ratio to the ordinary rate of interest than is the case in England.
The arrangements for the construction of Railways in India* by Joint Stock Com-
panies are stated to be as follows: —
Ist. A uniform gauge of 5 feet 6 inches is established.
2nd. Companies are protected against their own suicidal acts, and against their
injurious bearing upon the carrying trade, by giving a close control and supervision to the
Government over all their proceedings.
3rd. Companies are exempted from vexatious and costly legal and Parliamentary
proceedings and from the frauds attending voluntary arrangements with land-owners; and they
are assisted by receiving the land itself as an equivalent for certain advantages secured to
the Government.
4th. Government guarantees a limited rate (5 per cent.) of interest to the shareholders,
without which no companies would have undertaken the speculation, and consequently no
Railways would have been made,
sth. The Government supervision extends to a close scrutiny of companies’ accounts
and disbursements, thus placing a wholesome check upon any tendency to irregularities or
extravagance.
6th. In place of a Parliamentary investigation of the fitness of projects, this investi-
gation is retained as a function of the Government itself, aided by one or more consulting
engineers at each of the Presidencies; the supreme Government in India having a similar
officer attached to it. The consulting engineers are usually officers of the 11. E. I. Com-
pany’s Engineers, specially selected for this duty.
One peculiar feature in the construction of some of the Madras Railway Works has
been their execution by the company themselves direct; and under this system the earth-
works upon this Railway were constructed at a cost of per cubic yard,f in place of
the Surat Bazaar price for earthwork, and this system Colonel Kennedy recommends for
adoption upon the Bombay works.

a mile of lead.
The average cost of the Bombay line is estimated at £6,000 per mile; the Campbelltown line is

It possesses obvious advantages in a new country when the best official assistance is
secured for superintendence that can be obtained, irrespective of the increased amount paid
in salaries, which will always be found to be a very small per centage upon the saving
effected by employing only the best men that can be had.
In Belgium 353 miles of Railway have been most successfully constructed and
managed by the State alone. The average gross receipt upon the whole of the lines exceeded
in 1856 £2,100 per mile per annum, and was rapidly increasing, experience shewing, as has
already been stated, that upon these lines the traffic of the first year is doubled within 5
years. . ,
The small state of Belgium had but just established its independence when the
statesmen to whom its Government was confided, seeing the contemptuous regards cast upon
it by the Powers of the North and East, resolved, by an effort of enterprise and art, to confer
upon it that influence which was denied to it by its insignificant territory, its small popula-
tion, and limited Commerce. •
They entered, therefore, upon the construction of the Belgian State Railways.
These consist of two great trunk lines, forming a cross, the intersection being at
Malines. One line extends from Ostend to Liege, and Verviers, near the Prussian frontier;
the other from Antwerp through Brussels by Monstothe French territory near Valenciennes.
There are several secondary lines.
The date of the law sanctioning the project was May, 1834 ; its execution was com-
menced in June of the same year. The system was constructed at the national expense, and
is worked under national management.
The statesmen to whom the country is indebted for this great work were MM. Lebeau
and Rogier.
The progress of the work was as follows: —
c ° Length in operation.
Miles.
The cost per mile was £18,016. The gross receipts in 1841, £249,250; in 1847,
£593,444; in 1856, £741,300.
“ The extraordinary expedition with which the Belgian Railroads were completed, has
“ been mainly caused by the circumstance of their having been executed by the and
“ their execution being conducted under the superintendence of a special Railway Committee,
“ invested with adequate powers. By this expedient innumerable official formalities were
« avoided. The two Engineers, M.M. Simon and Beridder, who had proposed the project,
“ were invested with the general direction of the works; and full powers were given them
“ to form contracts, purchase land, and make other definitive arrangements necessary for
“ carrying on the works, without reference to higher official powers. *
The last system under which Railways have been constructed to which I shall draw
attention is the French, the leading characteristics of which are enumerated by Mr. Locke in
the paper to which I have already drawn attention, to be as follows: —
Ist. The State determines the locality and direction of the main arterial lines of
Railway, and forbids competition within special districts. All Railways must originate with,
or be sanctioned by, the State.
2nd. When the Minister of Public Works has decided that any project is of “ public
(t utility,” he selects the most eligible competitor, if there be more than one, and enters into
a preliminary treaty, which, when approved by the Government and the Chamber or Senate
and signed by the Emperor, becomes law. The “ Cahier des charges,” fixing the conditions
of the concession, and the powers of the Company are settled at the same time.
The Government furnish any plans or other information in their possession; and the
line is then laid out. The Cahier des charges allows considerable latitude in the selec-
tion of the line. The preliminary survey is presented by the Company to the Minister of
Public Works, who, after consulting with the Conseil des Ponts et Chaussees, signifies his
approval through the PrefSt to the Company. Meanwhile, plans and references are prepared
* Railway Economy, by Dionysius lardner, D.C.L., &c.


for each commune, or parish, which, being sent to the Prefet, are by him communicated to
the Mayors of the communes. Their receipt is notified on the doors of the Church and of
the Maine, and by the beat of drum, and they remain during eight days for inspection of all
who are interested. A proces-vcrbal is then drawn up, of all objections, for submission to
the Prefet, by whom a commission is named, composed of Members of the Conseil-General of
the Department, the Mayors of the communes interested, and the Engineer of the Company.
The report from this commission is sent by the Prefet to the Government Engineers appointed
to report on the nature and fitness of the works and to superintend the fulfilment of the
clauses of the concession. The report of these Engineers being then sent, with all plans, &c.,
to the Minister of Public Works, his final decision is obtained. The Prefet then makes his
arrete de cessbilite, declaring transferable for public utility the parcels of land marked for
expropriation; the Procureur Imperial of the Civil Court of each district then requires
from the Tribunal orders of expropriation; the Civil Tribunal examines whether all the
formalities have been regularly fulfiled, decrees the expropriation, and from that moment all
the houses, land, &c., become the property of the company, by whom the amount of
indemnity, settled by agreeeraent or by jury, must be paid All these preliminaries occupy
from six to twelve months.
3rd. Between 1823 and 1842 concessions were made to companies for various lines,
but the whole were either constructed entirely at the expense of the promoters or lapsed. In
1842 a law was passed authorising the State to construct the Railways up to “ formation
“ level,” and to let, for a term of years, the working of the lines to companies who would
provide the permanent-way, engines, and rolling stock. This had the effect of giving con-
siderable impulse to the Railway system, and induced the importation of foreign
capital. The law was subsequently modified by the State granting “ subventions ’of
money instead of constructing the earthworks, &c. Up to 1842 the concessions granted
were under 600 miles; but in that year alone upwards of 1,400 miles were sanctioned.
Nearly all the concessions since 1842 have been based on the law of that year, or
have been in the modified form of giving a “ subvention ” in lieu of works with a minimum
guaranteed interest of 4 per cent., and an extension of term to 99 years. To this combina-
tion of pecuniary aid with a guarantee of interest m"ij he ascribed the rapid increase
in the development of the French Railway system since 1842. It is remarkable that this
timely aid granted by the State has been throughly successful, and in no case has the
guarantee for interest ever been claimed. Thus the object has been completely fulfilled
without any loss to the State.
4th. The most remarkable feature in the finance of the French Railways is the
proportion which the share-capital bears to the amount raised on obligations, or bonds. In
the whole capital engaged to be provided by the French Companies, amounting, in 1856, to
£137,960,000, there was then £50,000,000, in shares, while the remaining 63 per cent, bad
to be raised on obligations, or bonds; the result being, that as the rate of profit earned on
the entire costs is in excess of the current rate of interest, the dividend on the shares is
increased in proportion to the excess of the rate of profit over the rate of interest; and it
is estimated that the profit realised by the French Companies from this system of borrowing
amounts to upwards of 3 per cent, on their share capital.
sth. The accommodation for the public on the French lines is less than on the
English, permitting of greater economy, and influencing the profits.
6th. The cost of Railways in France is less than in England ; but they have gradually
risen from £18,600 per mile in 1841, to £26,664 per mile in 1854.
7th. The general result is, that the French system has reconciled the interests both
of the promoters and the State; the average annual dividends between 1854 and 1857, for
some of the Railways, having been as follows :—The Nord, 14 per cent., L’Est, 14 per cent ;
L'Ouest, 10 per cent.; Lyons to the Mediterranean, in 1855, 17 per cent., and in 1857, 28
per cent. ; the State at the same time having received, in return for its aid and protection from
rivalry, the gratuitous conveyance of the Mails, and a tax of 10 per cent, on passengers, and on
first-class goods; which two items yielded 5 per cent, on the sum of £36,000,000 of subven-
tions. Low tariffs were also fixed for soldiers, sailors, prisoners, paupers, ka ; participation,
in some cases, after certain division of profits; and the possession, at the end of the con-
cessions, of all the Railways in France.
Bth. The prosperity of the French Railways must be attributed principally to the
Government having sanctioned only main arterial lines, and to the assistance given in raising
the money by subvention and guarantee.


In reviewing these different systems, under which other countries have carried out
Railways, it may be observed that:— _ . . . ~,
Ist. The English system may he dismissed from consideration, as it is improbable
unassisted companies will, for many years to come, undertake the construction of main lines
in thL 7 consfcruct j on 0 f Railways in America by the Government failed from politi-
cal interference in the executive details. . -
The construction of Railways by companies, assisted by the Government, or Municipal
Corporations, failed from those having the management being mixed up with political matters.
Upon this Captain Gallon remarks —“ This arrangement is false in principle, and
“ combines two conflicting elements. If the Railway is a commercial speculation, the man-
« agement should be left to the Company; if, on the contrary, it is to be worked with a
“ political object, the commercial element should be left out of view, and the line be wholly
“ managed by the State.” • . . ... ,
In the Western States, where the soil is, for the most part, eminently fertile, the
construction of lines by companies, assisted by grants of land, has been very successful. _
3rd. The Indian system of the construction of the lines by Joint Stock Companies,
assisted by a Government guarantee of 5 per cent, on the capital raised, appears to work
successful IV.
4th. In Belgium the construction of Railways and their management by the State
has proved eminently successful ; the Government employed the most able men they could
find, and placed entire confidence in them. .
sth. In France the Railways have been constructed by companies having concessions
of 99 years, and who have been aided by the Government, both by subvention and guarantee;
and the result is most satisfactory. -
6th, In every country the Government exercises a more or less stringent control ever
the lines, and the principle now appears to be admitted that such a control, judiciously con-
ducted, is a safeguard both to the public who use the line, and the public whose funds have
made the line.
Means by which the Colony may carry out the proposed Eatensioes.
I do not apprehend that any serious hindrances need arise to prevent the short exten-
sions at present proposed for this Colony being proceeded with early. Their entire cost amounts
to only £820,000, including £107,000 for rails from England, and if necessary, the expendi-
ture of this sum may be spread over two, or even three years. At the same time, it should
be observed that the more rapidly the lines are completed, the quicker will be the returns on
the capital invested. , . », *
The Government might construct these works under the present system of loans, tor
it is not unusual after a financial crisis for the money market to become much easier than
befor6 ’ Or some eminent English contractor or contractors* might be found willing to under-
take the work for the Government at fair prices, and either to receive Debentures in payment
on reasonable terms, or the guarantee of the Colony for the interest on the capital mvested,
together with a mortgage on the extensions constructed. . . , . ,
Or such a firm might desire to undertake the works on the data now furnished, eit or
on their own account alone, or in company with others as a speculation, especially if they
received a concession of all future lines to be constructed in New South Wales, and assistance
similar to that given in France; the Government retaining similar privileges and sufficient
Modifications of these systems will easily present themselves, fair to all parties ; but
I should deprecate any arrangement with capitalists or companies that involved the transfer
to them of the existing lines, including rolling stock and stores, except upon such terms as
entirely to free in time the Colony from any burden on.account of them, because i believe
that the existing lines will become, as I have shewn, self-supporting. Should the lines ever
be transferred to companies, the public would at once lose the advantage of the reduction in
* I am the more disposed to think this from having observed in the daily papers that Sir Samuel
Morton Peto and Co., had tendered to construct the whole of the Victorian Hallways on terms to be
agreed upon between that Government and themselves; and that their offer m n 0 " .
being informal. The difficulty that it may be anticipated would arise as regards this Colony, in the
small amount of work proposed to be done at present.


rates, as soon as the lines became self-supporting, that would certainly take place were they
in the hands of Government, and it would be hard, in addition to this, to be burdened with
a perpetual tax for interests on any part of the first cost of their construction. In preference
to this, I think the Government should proceed with the extensions themselves, and retain
the management in their own hands, at any rate until the re-productive character of the lines
becomes so evident as to render capitalists glad to take them.
It is not, however, for me, but for the higher authorities, to decide by what means the
country can most advantageously carry out the extensions at present proposed to Penrith,
Singleton, and Picton.
Observations upon the future Management of Government Railways.
Before concluding my Report on the Railway branch of the Department under my
direction, I have to submit some observations on the future management of the Railways,
should the Government Railways Bill, now under the consideration of the House, be passed.
Some apprehensions have at times crossed my mind as to how far it would be possible
to work the Railways efficiently as a purely Government Department; and those apprehensions
would have been much stronger but for the confidence and cordial support the Commissioners
have enjoyed from both the Governments under whom they have had the honor to serve
since my arrival in the Colony.
Whatever phase the department may assume, certain things appear to be essentially
necessary, in order to ensure the safety of the public and the prosperity of the Railways.
Ist. The direct and undivided responsibility of the Executive Officers entrusted with
its direction to the Government.
2nd. Freedom from political bias, and from political interference in details.
3rd. To work the Railways precisely as if in the hands of a company ; and, therefore, —
4th. The sanction of the Government to the Executive Officer to expend the sums
voted by Parliament for the working expenses, without reference to higher
authorities in matters of detail.
sth. Entire control over the working staff of the Railway.
6th. A speedy and simple system of Auditing the Accounts, at intervals never longer
than one month.
To the last point I have already* had the honor- of requesting the attention of the
Government, and the others, together with this, appear to contain everything necessary to
ensure the public safety and the prosperity of the Railways.
Captain Gallon, in his Report on the United States Railways, speaks as follows of the
New York and Erie Railway :
“ The whole system is based upon a principle which seems to be one well adapted to
“ secure economy and efficiency : viz., the maintenance of rigid discipline and such a distri-
“ bution of duties as will secure personal accountability through every grade of the service.
“ The idea upon which the system is founded is, that to work a line efficiently, the
“ responsible head must possess a complete daily history of the details of working in all their
“ minutiae, and the following general principles are laid down to carry it into effect:—
“ 1. A proper division of responsibilities.
“ 2. Sufficient power to enable the same to be fully carried out, that such respon-
“ sibilities may be real in their character.
u 3. The means of knowing whether such responsibilities are faithfully executed.
“4. Great promptness in the report of all derelictions of duty, that evils may be at
“ once corrected.
“ Such information to be obtained through a system of daily reports, and checks
“ that will not embarrass principal officers, nor lesson their influence with their
“ subordinates.
“ 6. The adoption of a system, as a whole, which will not only enable the General
“ Superintendent to detect errors immediately, but will also point out the
• “ delinquent.
“ The General Superintendent is solely responsible to the President of the line.”
The President of the line in this Colony would be the Government,
Lieutenant Colonel Kennedy, in his “Principles of Railway Construction Annalyzed”
writes as follows:
* Letter dated 7th April, 1858, —copy will be found in the Appendix marked 13.


“ The Gold Mining Company may be ruined whilst the rag dealer derives profit from
“ his calling, because the elements most essential to success may be deficient in the former,
“ whilst they are concentrated in the latter.
“ These elements may be defined as follows: —
“ 1. An intimate knowledge of the subject undertaken in those who project it and
“ direct its progress.
“ 2. Forethought, perseverance, and caution in its pursuit.
u 3. Economy and fidelity in the execution.
“4. Concentrated responsibility and undivided attention in the executive direction of
“ the means employed.
“ 5. Combination of interests of the agency employed with the success of the enterprise.
<< A Board of six able and irresponsible men, by attending an hour each week, would
“ ruin a sound speculation, where a single individual, of very ordinary capacity, having a
“ knowledge of the subject, giving his whole attention to it, and working consistently to
“ accomplish the object in view under rationally laid down principles, would make the result
“ remunerative.”
Both these gentlemen are high authorities on Railway principles. I have quoted
them chiefly with the object of shewing the views they entertain of the direct and individual
responsibility necessary for the efficient carrying on of Railways, and of the confidence and
authority necessary to be given to those held responsible.
Recapitulation.
The various subjects I have had the honor of thus far bringing under consideration
may be briefly recapitulated.
1. It is a matter of the first consequence that the Railways of the Colony should
become, as early as possible, self-supporting.
2. The existing Railways are not so.
3. There, is, however, a marked improvement in the present year, which may be
looked upon as permanent
4. Considerable as the improvement is, it is not sufficient to render the Railways
self-supporting.
5. It becomes necessary, therefore, to inquire whether any causes exist that hinder
the prosperity of the Railway, and the measures that should be adopted for their
removal.
6. There are three principal causes as regards the Great Southern Railway,—
The situation of the terminal station at Sydney.
The present fares.
The short length of the line.
7. The remedies proposed are —
The construction of a tramway from Redfern to Sydney Cove.
A revised scale of rates, as submitted.
Judicious extensions, including those proposed in the Estimate for 1858 to
Picton and Penrith.
8. The Great Northern Railway labors not only under the same disadvantages as the
Southern, but also under those of having no extensive population at either
terminus, and of having a navigable river running parallel with its course.
9. Further extension is absolutely necessary for the financial prosperity of the Great
Northern Railway, and the extension to Singleton, as provided for in the
Estimates for 1858, is recommended,
10. The systems under which Railways have been constructed in different countries
are discussed, with the view of ascertaining what measures it would be most
advantageous for the Colony to adopt to carry out the extensions proposed.
11. Various systems are suggested for the decision of the higher authorities.
12. Some observations are submitted upon the future management of Government
Railways. < .
I have thought it my duty, under the peculiar circumstances in which Railways now
stand in this Colony, to discuss each of these subjects in detail, and I trust the Government
will consider their great importance as a sufficient warrant for the length at which I have
done so.


RAILWAY EXTENSION AND TRIAL SURVEYS.
With the sanction of the Government; I have entirely remodelled this branch of my
The Licensed Survevors who were attached to the Railway Department in 1855 have
returned to their duties in the Survey Department, and a saving in the Railway Survey Staff
of £7.200 a year has thus been effected.
Trial surveys have been made by these Surveyors of the country as far north as
Armidale, and as far south as Yass, which, I trust, may be found of some value hereafter.
Trial surveys have also been made by the men of the Royal Engineers of the country
between Parramatta, Penrith, Windsor, and Bathurst. . . T t.
Upon these surveys the preliminary plans and sections for the extensions 1 nave
proposed have been prepared, and, when the general lines shewn in these have been approved
of the working surveys, plans, and sections can immediately be made.
The system I have adopted consolidates for the time the survey stall upon one point;
it permits of their effective superintendence, and provides for their labor being used in the
most advantageous manner, and, together with other causes, has enabled me to reduce the
Estimate for this branch of my department from £27,000 to £12,000 for the present year
Under this system the country is now being explored and surveyed between the
Hawkesbury and Bathurst.
I shall have the honor of submitting, as soon as these surveys have been completed,
a Special Report upon this portion of the country, which I hope previously to be able to
visit in I P e^.°“- be gufficient; at present, to say that no labor is being spared by the Engineer
employed upon this duty, and those under his orders* to ascertain the best line. Ravines
and gullies, never, it is believed, before entered, have been explored, and days passed in the
necessary examination of valleys where it is dangerous for man, and impossible for a horse,
t 0 lam not in a position, at present, to point out the best line for a Railway to Bathurst;
but I have reason to believe that a practicable line will be found, although it may possibly
be necessary to cut or tunnel occasionally through soft sandstone rock, a matter of no great
regret, if in so doing coal fields are opened up, which I anticipate they would be.
° jf there be any truth in a rumour which has reached me—that the best line to connect
Sydney with Melbourne on the one side, and with the Northern Districts on the other, would
be found by way of Bathurst, great importance attaches to the present survey, in addition
to that arising from a better means of communication being provided between Sydney and
the int can however be determined, equally careful surveys must be made
of the country, both to the south and north,— a matter involving considerable time and labor.
In the meantime the survey to Bathurst is being vigorously pushed.
I do not consider the present uncertainty of the best line to Bathurst beyond the
Hawkesbury a sufficient reason for deferring the line to Penrith. A considerable period must
in any case elapse before a Railway will be completed to Bathurst, during which time the
traffic must pass by the present main road, and via Penrith to Sydney; and I have already
discussed the propriety of a Railway being constructed under these circumstances.
Should the valley of the Grose ultimately be found to present the best line, the Rail-
way would cross the Hawkesbury between Penrith and Richmond, and join the Parramatta
and Penrith line a few miles beyond the river. From the point of junction to 1 ennth would
then be a short branch ; and hereafter two others, for which the country is favorable, might
connect Windsor and Richmond with the main line. . , .. . ,•.
Whater direction, however, the main line may ultimately take, it may be anticipated
that before its action could interfere with that of a line to Penrith, the development of that
part of the country will have been such, from its position as the temporary western terminal
station, as to render a branch connecting it with the main line self-supporting.
Reliable trial surveys, such as that now in progress towards Bathurst, convey infor-
mation absolutely requisite for the consideration of the question of further extensions, m
whatever manner such extensions may be ultimately carried out.
* Mr. Barton and the detachment of Koyal Engineers.


THE ROADS.
It is not necessary for me to trouble the Government at any great length with
remarks upon those portions of the main roads at present under my general direction the
question of the future management of the main roads of the Colony being already under their
consideration in another form. A first step has, however, been taken towards their ultimate
improvement, in accordance with the suggestions contained in my former 1 epor .
Having been requested by the Government to undertake the repair of the Denison
Bridge, at Bathurst, endangered by the floods of last .winter, I selected for this duty an
Engineer acquainted with the principles of the construction of roads as well as bridges, and
when the duty he was more immediately sent upon was completed, directed him, with the
sanction of the Government, to examine in detail the road between Parramatta and Bathurst.
My object in this was to lay before the Government a reliable statement of the cost
of placing the present road between these two points in good condition, and of afterwards
maintaining it; and also of what deviation, if any, were advisable, and their cost; in order
that the relative expense of Railways and Roads for this district might be fairly compare ,
and in order to facilitate the formation of the road where necessary, and to provide tor its
repair and maintenance on a defined system, instead of making desultory repairs, scanti y
done at first with insufficient funds, and too frequently destroyed when scarcely completed.
I shall have the honor of shortly laying a Report upon this road before the Govern-
ment, and I have already recommended that similar steps should be taken in reference to the
other main roads of the Colony. .
There is an expenditure required upon a particular road not under my charge, viz.,
the direct road from Camden to Campbelltown, which I have already alluded to, and to
which I have again to request consideration, as it bears immediately upon the future pros-
perity of the Southern Railway. . -
This road is at present undvained, and all but unformed, and there is also a part ot
it (Kenny’s Hill) which forms a most serious obstacle to traffic along it.
A Mance at the ground will shew that the road never should have passed, as at present,
over the highest summit of the hill; it should be diverted into its natural course, and at the
same time formed and drained throughout. ,
I am of opinion this work will tend so directly to increase the goods traffic ot the
Railway as to entitle it to be at once considered a reproductive work, and I recommend its
immediate execution. „ . ,
The construction of Plank Roads in districts where metal is scarce and difficult to be
obtained, and wood abundant, to which I alluded in my former_ Report, has received my
further attention. The short lengths made at different times in this Colony, chiefly by way
of experiment or as the readiest means of effecting a temporary repair, have, from the absence
of machinery and the high price of labor, been rudely put together, and at considerable cost.
The reports I have received as to their duration and convenience, compared with other parts
of the roads, have been favorable; but lam informed that in Victoria, Plank Roads have
been tried on a large scale, and found unsuccessful. Authentic information has been sought
on this subject from the Government of that Colony, which, if supplied, will furnish very
interesting data for a further consideration of the value of this description of road.
Whatever may be the description of roadway ultimately found best suited to t ic
resources and wants of each district, the importance of improved means of communication
cannot be over-rated, whether the financial prosperity of the Colony be considered, or its
unity as a State.
THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.
In reporting, for the first time, upon this branch of my Department, it will be inter-
esting briefly to trace the rise and progress of the Electric Telegraph, not only in New South
Wales but in Australia generally, so far as I possess information upon it at present.
The Victoria Telegraph.
The Colony of Victoria took the lead in this great inter-colonial work, the construc-
tion of a line of Electric Telegraph to connect Melbourne with Williamstown having been
* I omitted in my former Report to state the source from which I drew much of the information
afforded upon these and other roads, viz., “ Gillespie on Roads and Railroads.


directed as far back as the 10th November, 1853, completed in February, 1854, and publicly
opened on the 3rd March, 1854, although, pending the introduction of the Electric Telegraph
Act, 17 Victoria, No. 22, no charge was made for the transmission of messages by the public
until the Ist May following *
In September, 1854, an extension of the line was commenced, and on the sth December
following, communication with Geelong was established, and the line from Geelong to the
Heads having been in progress simultaneously, communication with Queenscliff was opened
on the 30th of January, 1855. A branch line from Melbourne to Sandridge was also com-
pleted and placed in operation on the Ist July, 1855, so that at this period there were in
operation 72 miles of line as follows: —
Melbourne to Geelong via Williamstown 50 miles
Geelong to Queenscliff 20 „
Melbourne to Sandridge 2 „
Total 72f
In the month of November, 1855, it was decided to extend lines respectively from
Geelong to Ballaarat, and from Melbourne to Sandhurst via Castlemaine. The work was
commenced early in May, and the line Geelong and Ballaarat, a distance of 58
miles, was permanently opened on the 14th December, 1856, and communication over the
line from Melbourne to Sandhurst tested on the 20th of the same month, the distance being
125 miles.
In the year 1856, also, the Governments of Victoria and Tasmania, entered into a
correspondence relative to the establishment of a submarine telegraph between the two
Colonies at their joint expense, the cost of the portion from Tasmania to Cape Otway to be
divided equally, and a branch line from Queenscliff or Warrnambool to Cape Otway to be
made at the expense of Victoria.
The submarine portion of the line was carefully surveyed by Mr. McGowan in the
months of October and November, 1857, and it has been decided the line should leave Vic-
toria at Parker Cove, Cape Otway, and be laid down to a sandy cove in King’s Island, named
Victoria Cove. From thence it is to be carried across the island to Sea Elephant Bay, and
from this point to the north-western bight of Hunter or Barren Island, passing about three
quarters of a mile north of Albatross Island; from the north the line passes to a cove on the
south side of Hunter Island, nearly opposite the lower end of Stack Island, and thence to a
high sand patch about a mile to the westward, and two miles from Cape Grim, in
The cable suggested by Mr. McGowan is a single copper wire cable, the wire of num-
ber 16 gauge, the cable to weigh not less than one ton to the mile ) the extreme cost of the
entire line was estimated at £33,000 in 1856.§
* Report of Mr. S. W. McGowan, Superintendent of the Electric Telegraph in Victoria, dated
31 December, 1856.
t The cost of constructing these lines and stations, the latter being on a permanent scale, was
£17,600. In May, 1856, the monthly charges were £360, and monthly receipts about £450.

The effect of this line, when carried out, will he to place Hobart Town in instan-
taneous communication with Adelaide and Sydney, via Melbourne, as soon as the inter-colonial
lines in progress are completed.
A contract for the portion from Cape Otway to Cape Grim was made on the
7th instant; the date fixed for completion being the Ist May, 1859, and the cost
£25,000.
In the course of the year 1857, the telegraphic lines to the western and north-eastern
boundaries of Victoria have also been completed; the line via Ballaarat, Fiery Creek,
Hexham, Warrnambool, and Portland, to the South. Australian boundary, having been
completed on the 29th December, 1857 ; and that to the River Murray opposite Albury,
via Sandhurst, Kilmore, Bongwood, Benalla, Wangaratta, Beechworth and Bel voir, on
the sth of the same month. The distance from Ballaarat to Portland being 280 miles;
and from Melbourne to Portland, 338 miles; and from Melbourne to the River Murray,
260 miles.
The lines contemplated for construction during the year 1858 are an extension from
Raglan (Fiery Creek) to Ararat; Castlemaine to Ballaarat, embracing, en route, Maryborough,
Dunolly, Creswick, &c.; Sandhurst to Echuca, on the River Murray; and the line, already
alluded to, now fixed from Geelong to Cape Otway to meet the submarine line to
Tasmania.
Such have been, up to the present time, the exertions of Victoria to establish inter-
colonial telegraphic communications; and one cannot but admire the ability and energy with
which they have been carried on.
The system of construction is extremely simple, and in accordance with that pursued
in America.
The posts used are saplings of blue gum, red gum, white gum, stringy-bark, and iron-
bark, except between Melbourne and Sandridge, the posts there being of Baltic deal.
The measurement of each sapling is usually twenty-five feet in length by nine inches
square at the base, tapered to five inches at the top; the base of the post is thoroughly
charred and tarred for five feet six inches in height, and is buried five feet in the ground,
the holes being bored by earth augers. There are thirty posts to each mile.
The insulators are “ bell pattern,” of the best quality, of hard baked and highly
glazed earthenware.
A single conducting wire of number 6 galvanized iron is found sufficient to meet all
the ordinary requirements of traffic.
The cost of the lines has varied considerably,—the first, between Melbourne and
Williamstown having been contracted for at £193 15s. per mile; the second, between
Williamstown and Queenscliffe, at £ll5 15s. From Geelong to Ballaarat the line cost £B2,
and from Melbourne to Sandhurst £73 per mile; the extensions from Ballaarat to the South
Australian frontier, and from Melbourne to the Murray, on the New South Wales boundary,
having cost respectively £65 10s. and £59 15s. per mile.
The system adopted in working is the Morse, the instrument used being Morse’s
Recording Telegraph, usually in the single acting form; the double acting Morse instru-
ments, manufactured by Siemens and Halske, of Berlin, being used at important terminal
stations.* The battery employed is a Groves Battery, or Chester’s patent.
The offices are kept open for the transmission of messages by the public generally
from 8-30 am. until 8 p.m. The regulations for the transmission of telegrams are of the
usual nature. ,
I understand that the Head Office at Melbourne is kept open all night.
In Table 28 will be found a record of the working of the lines, interesting especially
as shewing the rapid increase in the number of messages sent, and consequently in the
revenue.
The net receipts for the year 1857, including £1,671 Bs. Bd. as the value of
despatches on the public service, were £3,531 18s. 2d., affording interest at the rate of nine
per cent, per annum on £40,000, the round cost of establishing the line, —but Mr. McGowan
anticipates, that if office accommodation easy of access were provided at Melbourne, the
revenue of that station would receive a marked addition.
* The chief novelty of this instrument consists in its double action, by means of which a message
can he transmitted and received by the same instrument at the same moment. ,


The construction of the Adelaide City, Port, and sea-coast line was commenced m
December, 1855, opened to the Port on the 18 th February, 1856,.and1 to Le Fevres
Peninsula early in the following month. Between Adelaide and the Port the line is over
ground; there are thirty-two posts to the mile, and four wires; the insulators are inverted
cones of white porcelain In the streets of Adelaide a six wire cable is laid under ground
in divided iron pipes, and the same has been done at the Port, and across Le levi
Peninsula; seven hundred yards of a six wire submarine cable being laid under the creek
The cost of the line, including the erection of stations, was about £3,0-4, or £

the 18th February, 1856, to the 80th Juno, 1857, as compared with 29,284 the number
sent during thirty-three months, ending December, 1856, on the Victorian lines.
In April, 1856, the Governments of South Australia and Victoria entered into com
munication relative to the establisnment of an inter-eolonial line of te-egraphi * nd *
of the same year, Mr. Charles Todd, Superintendent of
proceeded to Melbourne for the purpose of procuring information to facilitate the execution
of the desired object; by whom and Mr. McGowan a joint Report was presented to their
respective Governments, dated 25th August, 1856.
This Keport, after alluding to the importance of connecting New South ales with
the general system, recommended, among other things, that:
Each Government should erect the line of telegraph within its own territory, and
carry it to a common point on the boundary. , n , , . i
The same description of instrument should be used throughout the Colo ,
code, regulations, and arrangements be as nearly as possible identical.
There should be an equal division of receipts, derived from all intercolonial messages,
between what stations soever they may pass.
These suggestions received the general assent of the two Governments.
Mr. Todd, in returning to Adelaide overland, made a careful survey of the country
from Portland, and recommended the following as the route for the line to to ow .
“ From Adelaide, by the south road, over Tapleys Hill, through N oarlu,aga and
“ Willunga to Middleton ; thence along the tramway to 1 ort Elliot, and ba I
“ tramway to Goolwa; from Goolwa across to Hmdmarsh and Mundoo Islands to Pe

« Bay, when it should turn in the direction of Mount Gambier, and from Mount Gam bier by
« Soad to the punt near the mouth of the Glenelg,-the distance being about 325 miles.
The Legislature approved of the route recommended, and voted in February, 1 7,
the sum of £20,500 to erect the line; and a contract was entered into for its construe m
for £4O a mile, the Government finding wire and fittings and tfa e . e*tuna g

The system of construction, the instruments and materials used, and the general
arrangements for working, are closely assimilated to those of Victoria. The posts are,
however, only 22 feet long in place of 25 j a large extent of the country traversed being
destitute of serviceable timber.
This line is intended to be opened on the Ist proximo j and it must be very satisfactory
to those who by their efforts and cordial co-operation have contributed so materially to its
success, to see inter-colonial communication so rapidly advancing.
The Tasmanian Lines.
I have not received any official report upon the lines that are being constructed in
Tasmania, and am therefore indebted to the reports of Messrs. McGowan and Todd, and to
the statements of the daily press, for the scanty information I can at present submit. _
I learn, however, that in July, 1856, Mr. Champ, then the Honorable the Colonial
Secretary in Tasmania, visited Melbourne for the purpose of inspecting the Electric
Telegraph, prior to its introduction into Tasmania, and that, on his return, a line from
Georgetown to Mount Lewis was commenced.
In September of the same year a correspondence was opened between the Govern-
ment of Tasmania and that of Victoria, relative to the establishment of telegraphic inter-
communication, the result of which has been the undertaking of the submarine line from
Cape Otway to Cape Grim, which I have already detailed in my sketch of the Victoria lines.
This line will be iu connexion with that to Hobart Town via Circular Head, George-
town, and Launceston. . . .. . n
I am under the impression that the line, or a portion of the line, between George-
town, Launceston, and Hobart Town, is now in operation. . , ,
The distance betweep Melbourne and Hobart Town is 682 miles by telegraph, the
estimated cost of the line being £45,000.*
Western Australia,
I have no information respection the construction of telegraphic lines in this portion
of Australia.
New South Wales Lines.
While the construction of lines was commenced in Victoria as far back as the end. of
1858, and in South Australia at the end of 1855, no contract was made for their construction
in this Colony till the middle of May, 1857 j it is not, therefore, surprising, that telegraphic
communication should be less advanced here than in the sister Colonies.
As far back, however, as the end of March, 1854, an Estimate of the cost of con-
structing a line ten miles in length was ordered and sent in to the Government. The estima e
amounted to £2OO a mile.f . „ , _ , ■
Towards the end of 1855 (November), the attention of the Government appears to
have been again turned to this subject,—a Report from Mr. McGowan, of the probable cost
of constructing a line between Melbourne and Sydney having been laid before it.|
In August, 1856, a further communication was made to the Government on tins
In September of the same year, the Chief Secretary, Melbourne, addressed the
Colonial Secretary, Sydney, requesting to be informed whether, in the event of the Electric
Telegraph being extended to the Victoria side of the river Murray, the Government of New
South Wales would undertake to construct a line from Sydney to connect with it.
A Select Committee of the Legislative Assembly]) was appointed on the dlSt October,
* Reports of Messrs. McGowan and Todd, and “ Correspondence relative to the Establishment of
“ Electro-Telegraphic Communication between the Australian Colonies.” Victoria, 1806,

to consider and report upon the subject of the introduction into New South Wales of the
Electric Telegraph. The Committee recommended, on the 18th December, —
“ That immediate steps be taken, in concert with the Government of Victoria, to
« connect the Cities of Sydney and Melbourne by Electric Telegraph.
(( That a sum not exceeding £38 ; 000 be placed on the Estimates for 1857 for that
“ purpose.”
The Committee recommend also the connexion, at an early period, of the town of
Bathurst with the metropolis by Electric Telegraph.
The sum of £38,000 was accordingly placed upon the Estimates for 1857.
A contract was entered into for the construction of the line from Liverpool to Albury,
on the 11th of May last, tenders having been called for by public competition.
The result appears to afford another proof of the inadequacy of the system of tender
by public competition to provide efficiently for the execution of large public works, especially
in a new country. .
I was not in the Colony at the time, but I am aware that every pains were taken to
ascertain the competency of the contractor and his sureties, to whom as being the lowest
tender, the work was given. . ..
At the same time the Government undertook the construction themselves ot the line
along the Railway to Liverpool.
It soon became apparent that the contractor was incompetent to perform the work he
had undertaken, and, after allowing full time to give him a fair trial, the Government
terminated the contract on the 12th October, on the only clause giving the power—that of
unnecessary delay. , , . „ ~. , , ~
Negotiations were at once entered into, with the view of avoiding delay, with parties
competent to execute the work; the Government considered the terms asked too high, and
tenders were again called for by public competition. _
The usual delays inevitably attendant upon this system of carrying on public works
occurred, and, although the tender of the present contractor was provisionally accepted on
the 12th November, it was not until the 18th January last the bond was signed. _
The line between Berrima and Picton was completed on the Ist instant, a distance of
thirty-three miles; since then the progress of the work has been more satisfactory; and the
line will be ready to be opened to Goulburn about the Ist proximo; but I cannot anticipate
that the line will now be completed in the time specified without the most strenuous exertions
on the part of the contractor. . , ....
The price of the present contract is £57 per mile, without instruments or buildings;
that of the original contract having been £49 14s. 6d. _
In the meantime considerable difficulty had been experienced relative to the line
between Liverpool and Picton, a distance of thirty-three miles.
When the first contract was terminated, the works were very incomplete upon this
portion, and immediately upon its termination several parties waited upon me to state that
they had not been paid, either for materials or labor; some of these were apparently laboring
men It was evident that these parties had no legal claim upon the State, but the Govern-
ment were very desirous that they should, if practicable, be paid.
I am happy to state that, after a delay of many months, this has been effected, and
the claims sent in, up to the time of the signing of a new bond, have been paid.
The arrangement, under which this was effected, was the making of a second contract
with the original contractor, for the completion of the line from Picton to Liverpool, on con-
dition that the sub-contractors, under the original contract, should be paid their several
claims. contract was ma( j e on t h e 25th February, 1858, and the work completed on the
18th Marbh last, the price paid being £1 per mile less than that first agreed upon, the
Government taking the maintenance of the line at once into their own hands.
It. is due to the sureties of this second contract to state that it was efficiently carried
The line between Sydney and Liverpool, 22 miles, was completed in the early part
of October last, but was not then opened.
On the 27th of the same month a line to connect Sydney with the South Head was,


by order of the Government, commenced, and was completed early in the following January,
at a cost of £657 6s. Bd., or about £9l per mile, including instruments and station fittings.
The cost of this line was increased by most of the holes having to be put down in
rock for the posts, and by additional labor in coming through the City.
Detailed statements of the Telegraph Accounts to the 31st December, 1857, will be
found in the Appendix, Table 27.
Arrangements having been made with the Directors of the Exchange Company for
the use of two excellent rooms in the Exchange as a head office for the present, at a nominal
rent, an instrument was placed there, and the Liverpool and South Head lines connected
with it, instruments being at the same time set up at those stations.
These instrements were Siemen and Halske’s recording instruments, there being no
single acting Morse instruments to be obtained. They will be found very useful, especially
hereafter as the lines extend.
On the 26th January last, the Liverpool and South Head lines were formally opened
by His Excellency the Governor General, and on the following day for general use, and they
have worked satisfactorily to the present lime.*
As soon as the line to Goulburn is opened, the Colony will possess the power of
instantaneous communication over 130 miles.
The inhabitants of Albury having, at their own cost, continued the Victoria line to
Albury, applied to the Government to have a station opened; and the necessary arrangements
having been made, the Albury Station was connected with Belvoir on the 9th instant, and
opened for public business. The temporary station in use has been erected and fitted at the
expense of one of the inhabitants."f
I shall have the honor of immediately submitting, for the consideration of the
Government, the terras upon which Mr. McGowan, (with whom I have been in communication
upon the subject), proposes the accounts for inter-colonial messages should be arranged.
On the 15th March last the Government directed lines to be constructed, to connect
the Signal Station at Fort Phillip, the Port Office, and Post Office, and the Railway Office,
with the South Head and the Albury lines, at a cost not exceeding £2OO, including
instruments and batteries.
These extensions were completed on the 31st of the same month,J and they will
ultimately effect a saving of labor, as messengers will no longer be required for the
purpose of delivering shipping intelligence between the Harbour Office, Post Office, and
Signal Station. The advantage to the Railway Department in meeting the wants, and
ensuring the safety of the public using the rail, will be very great; and the more so as
single lines extend. Indeed, it is barely safe to work a long single line of Railway without
the security afforded by the telegraph.
Arrangements have been made by which messages can be transmitted between the
Exchange and the South Head at any hour of the day or night, and the office will immedi-
ately be opened for night duty.
In order to form an economical staff of operators, who may at the same time be
depended upon, young lads are being paid the nominal wages of 2s. 6d. per week, and
trained up to a knowledge of telegraphy. Three are, already, fairly expert operators. lam
informed this has given rise to some misconceptions as to the number of persons employed
at the Exchange, but the system will be found advantageous to the public in whatever light
it is viewed. *
It will be necessary to take early measures to construct, or obtain, suitable buildings
for stations up the country.
The construction of the New South Wales lines is similar to that of Victoria and
South Australia; the instruments and batteries used are the same; and it is proposed to
assimilate all the arrangements, as far as possible, to those of the sister Colonies.
* These lines were constructed, and the instruments set up, under the immediate superintendence
of Mr. Lay, now operating Clerk at Albury.
t Mr. Nichols. f
1 The assistance the Government have afforded me, by the appointment of Mr.' Cracknell as
Assistant Superintendent of Electric Telegraphs, permitted this service to he thus rapidly and efficiently
performed.


The posts are sound saplings, twenty-three feet in length, nine inches at the base, and
seven or eight inches at the top. They are of box, iron-bark, or stringy-bark, tarred and
charred for five feet up from the b«tt, and the top bound with hoop-iron. They carry a single
wire (No. 6, galvanized.) which is insulated from the posts by a brown earthenware insulator,
of the umbrella shape, fixed on the top of the posts by a wooden, or, in some cases, iron pm,
and secured by a mixture of resin, shellac, and Venice turpentine, the wire being bound to
the insulator at each point by a binding-wire (No. 10), and very perfect insulation appears to
be maintained. The instruments used are Morse’s Recording Instruments, and the batteries
are Chester’s Patent; and a sulphate of copper local battery is also being tried. The Offices
are open from 9 A. M. to 0 P M., daily, Sundays excepted, and messages can be sent at any
hour of the day or night between the Exchange and the South Head.
When the line is opened through to Melbourne it may be anticipated the Electric
Telegraph will be a reproductive work. Mr. McGowan, as I have already stated, is of opinion
the Victoria lines will pay more than nine per cent.
I submit for the consideration of the Government, the importance of early extensions,
at least, to Bathurst and Newcastle j the latter would, among more important matters, greatly
facilitate the effective supervision of the Northern Railway.
The Government are aware of the immense importance of telegraphic communication
with England via India.
The prosperity of the Colony, and its unity as a State, are inseparable from improve-
ment in the existing condition of Internal Communication, whether Railways, Roads, or the
Electric Telegraph be considered.
I have, &c.,
