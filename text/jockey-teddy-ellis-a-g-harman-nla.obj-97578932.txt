: JOCKEY TEDDY ELLIS :
Don’t you take any notice of him Mum,
The Old Man’s a bit cranky to-night;
i i Words spoken in jest, then tragedy come,
With the death of a jockey so bright.
Young Teddy Ellis—so cheerful and free,
His name was known far and wide;
He rode Mlllermetre to victory,
That was his last winning ride'.
In front of the steps of his Kensington home,
His life’s blood ebbed away;
In the arms of his mother his spirit had flown,
He’s at peace with his maleer to-day.
The jockeys of Sydney all morn for their pal
Who death so suddenly claimed ;
They pafd their respects at his funeral,
And wept at his grave unashamed.
A sincere tribute —what wo'rds fail to tell,
These jockeys their names you all know T ;
Davidson —McCarten—Pa'rr—Cracknel!—
Jack Toohey—and Jimmie Munro.
An aeroplane dropped a wreath overhead,
A few yards from the grave did land ;
Gliding gently in 'respect for the dead,
As if guarded by an unseen hand.
Tis sad to think how it all came to pass,
The boy by the father was slain ;
Drink —a quarrel!—throwing a glass,
And cutting the jugular vein,
j The father in tears told his story in court,
The mother sc bitte'r told her’s ;
My boy he was my sole support,
Tin n told of slanders and slurs.
Acquitted of all blame for the death of hi« son
Rebuked,, by the wife he had wed ;
A father will ponder when races are run,
Now Jockey Teddy Ellis is dead.
