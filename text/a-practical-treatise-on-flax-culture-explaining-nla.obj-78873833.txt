SUBPAGE.
In presenting this little brochure to the public, I may state
that I have been induced to ?rush into print? by inquiries
from all parts of the colonies as to where a reliable and 'practical
guide to the Max Industry in all its stages and aspects can be
procured. Max-growing is now probably the best and most
remunerative industry for the farmers of Australia, inasmuch as
our soils and climatic conditions are, in most instances, pecu-
liarly adapted to it. My own experience in the principal flax
districts of Ulster convinces me that what has been so success-
fully done there can be equalled, if not pxceeded, here. The
development of the flax industry by the farmers will, besides,
bring in its train a number of other industries, such as the manu-
facture of canvas, twine, cordage, linseed oil, oil cake, and, let
us hope, linen and other delicate textiles, which have done
so much for Ulster. Such industries as these would give
employment to large numbers, and add greatly to the prosperity
of the colonies.
This pamphlet will be found to contain all the information
needed by the beginner to enable him to become a skilled flax-
grower ; but I desire to impress on the minds of my readers
that ? Slap-dash ? in flax culture will not eventuate in success.
Method and skill must be applied ; and in proportion thereto will
be the reward to the Australian grower.

FLAX GROWING.
INTRODUCTORY.
Australians, unlike tlieir American cousins, are slow to
embark in novel industries; and the cause is not far to seek
agriculture forms no part of the curriculum of the bov who
attends either the State-school or the college where he ? crams ?
for his matriculation ? exam.? The aim may be to qualify him
for a clerkshijA in a banking house or merchant?s office, or to
, t him for one of the ?learned? professions, but of scientific
instiuction in matters pertaining to the soil he remains utterly
barren. In this light the town boy buds and blossoms. The
country lad may become a decent ? empiric ? by following the
methods taught him by his parents. In a glorious y & oun<>-
country like this it is of the greatest importance a boy should
acquire an extensive knowledge of what must ultimately prove
to be its greatest industry; and until more boys are trained for
the plough and fewer for the pen a proper impetus will not be
given to a sound system of agriculture in all its manifold
branches. Our agricultural schools will in time do much to
remedy these defects, but so far they have not taken the
initiative in promoting any novel industry that I am aware of.
Once a new industry is mooted in this country the grower and
the manufacturer are advised to try every experiment from the
manufacture of a Damascus blade to the open air cultivation of
sub-tropical products. AYhether there is a local market or a
foieign one for the sale of these commodities when produced is
a matter of minor importance. The conditions which regulate
successful and profitable labour never enter into the calculation.
It suffices that an article has been produced elsewhere to ensure
its better production under perhaps totally different and less
favourable circumstances here. Persons earnestly desirous of
acquiring a practical knowledge of various products are thereby
discouraged, because they are in doubt whether the teacher is a
kindly faddist,? who has collected his information from
antiquated volumes, or is imparting his own practical experience
for the guidance of others. In order to put myself right with
my readers, it is necessary to remark that my knowledge of flax


cultivation has been acquired in the flax fields of Ulster, in the
north of Ireland, a locality where more excellent fibre is
produced than in any other part of the world of proportionate
area. The Journal de Commerce de Constantinople says for in-
stance; ??Ireland still heads the list per acre for quality and
quantity.?
Flax cultivation has made much headway during the last
couple of years in a number of places in these colonies. In those
parishes close to the town of Yarram, on the Victorian Great
?Southern line of railway, a great many acres have been devoted
to the growing of this crop. Mr. D. T. M?Kenzie, an enterpris-
ing settler, has gone into the business there with zest. He has
a complete scutching and breaking plant, worked by water
power, and he prepares the fibre for the majority of the farmers
residing within a reasonable distance of this flax mill. It is a
co-operative system to some extent. The farmers grow the flax,
and he prepares it as a marketable commodity. The same
division of labour prevailed in Ireland where circumstances ren-
dered it more advantageous than for each grower to break and
scutch his own crop. There is great economy in machinery in
this way, because more is not purchased and brought into requi-
sition than may be absolutely necessary to serve the requirements
of the district where flax is extensively grown. A grower can,
however, at a small expenditure, equip a plant of his own,
capable of breaking and scutching up to five or even ten acres.
The horse can be utilised as a motive power in the same way
that a chaffcutter is worked.
I may, perhaps, be permitted to slightly digress from the
main subject by drawing a contrast between the flax and the
sugar beet industries. Flax comes to maturity quickly?from
two and a half to three and a half months. It will often succeed
well on soil ?crop sick ? or worked out, and it cleans foul and
dirty wheat fields. Properly cultivated crops give a very hand-
some return to the grower, and the product is in good demand
in the local and home markets. Beet root takes a long time to
mature; requires a deep, strong, highly fertilised, and deeply
ploughed soil; necessitates very costly machinery, on which
there is a heavy duty, for the extraction of the beet juice and
manufacture of the sugar therefrom, and the product cannot
compete with Queensland sugar made from cane, unless the
latter be excluded by an almost prohibitory duty of 100 per cent,
or so. ? Flax gives the maximum of profit, with a minimum
expenditure in labour and machinery. The sugar beet industry
seems to me better calculated to, in these colonies, supply the
requirements of an ?artificial labour market,? propped up by
bonuses and prohibitory duties, than to cheapen the price of an
already cheap table requisite. The flax industry, if conducted
in a methodical manner, would create in a natural order of
things employment for the farmer and labourer, business for the


seeds merchant, oil-cake maker, oil manufacturer, shipper, and
home manufacturer of linen, lace, damask, cambric, duck, etc.
There is an excellent home market for carefully grown and well
prepared fibre. The United Kingdom imports annually 100,000
tons of foreign grown flax fibre, besides a very large quantity of
henm and ?tow.? The latter is, strictly speaking, the refuse of
the flax, and is used for innumerable purposes of rough manu-
facture, stuffing for chairs, etc. Flax growing is an industry suit-
able to our climate and many of our soils; but sugar extraction
from beet into the domain of the ?faddist,? who would
cultivate everything, from a banana grove to a rice field, simply
because he ?fancies? it or they would succeed here, owing to
their having progressed where the minimum rate of wages and
legal eight hours are unknown.
ANTIQUITY OF THE INDUSTRY.
The flax plant was originally a native of Egypt, where it
was cultivated from time immemorial. In the oldest records of
history, sacred and profane, mention is made of linen. The
Bible frequently refers to it as an article of commerce or a super-
ior material of dress. Kings, in olden times, are said to have
been clothed in scarlet and fine linen; ? and King Solomon, we
are told in the book of I. Kings, had horses and linen yarn
brought out of Egypt. This would indicate a high state of
civilisation, so far as the mechanical arts are concerned, at a
very remote period in the history of that country. To spin fine
yarn people would require delicately manufactured machinery,
and to make the machinery would necessitate an advanced know-
ledge of the mechanical arts. Herodotus makes mention of linen.
In addition to these evidences of the antiquity of the flax iudus-
try, it has been shown on scientific grounds that the cloth in
which mummies were shrouded was composed of linen. Professor
Balfour in his ?Manual of Botany? states ??Binen (lint) is formed
from woody tissue. Cotton, on the other hand, consists of
elongated cells or hairs, the membrane of which becomes con-
tracted in the process of drying, so as to appear twisted when
viewed under the microscope.? ?By this character,? says he,
u mummy cloth was shown to be composed of linen. The texture
of some of this cloth is extremely delicate.?
Flax may be termed in these colonies a ? novel
industry ; ? but it was a well-recognised one in a sub-tropical
country long antecedent to the disappearance of the Southern
Cross from the gaze of the ancient mariner who braved the
waves of tlm Baltic Sea. In the vegetable kingdom the flax
plant exemplifies the Darwinian theory of the survival of the
fittest ; it has thriven and proved useful to mankind in sub-tropi-
cal and temperate countries alike ; and to this day it preserves its
characteristics, for it grows luxuriantly in South Gippsland and


the Goulburn Valley in Victoria, and in Fassifernein Queensland.
A variety of it indigenous to Victoria hears a pale blue flower,
not unlike Riga, and attains a height of 2ft. 6in. to 3ft. It
is found in a wild state all over the Wimmera plains. Wherever
it grows in this way it will do better under a proper system, of
cultivation. If no other evidence were forthcoming of the suit-
ability of our soils and climate for flax growing, that itself would
be almost sufficient. But the mere growing of a useful plant is
not everything, viewed from the producer?s standpoint. There
are other things which must be carefully taken into consideration
to render the enterprise profitable, and these will be dealt with
further on in their proper order.
THE FLAX PLANT.
Botanists state there are about ninety species of the flax
family. Many of them have showy flowers, the colours being
blue, yellow, crimson, and white. I shall confine the attention
of my readers in these articles to one species, Linum mitatissimum ,
the flax of commerce, from which linen, cambric, lace, damask,
diaper, duck, check, drabbit, tick, huckaback, towelling, and
union (a mixture of the staple with cotton) are made. The plant
is an annual of slender growth, and in European countries rarely
attains a height exceeding 2ft. Gin. to 3ft. The plant consists of
three distinct portions?the central or hard pithy portion, techni-
cally called ?shove ? or ?boon,? over which are laid the fibres;
the bast or hurl; and, connecting these, the cuticle or outer
skin. To separate these parts from each other two distinct
operations have to be performed. Steeping, generally called
? retting,? for one, breaking and scutching for the other. Flax
when sown thin is a prolific seed producer ; but when cultivated
for fibre, the more valuable product, the great aim of the grower
should be to produce a plant with a single seed boll on top.
Those who desire to have a heavy crop of seed cannot at the
same time secure a large yield of fibre or even a small one of
good marketable fibre. The cotyledons of the seed are oleo-
aginous, and by expression yield linseed oil, which, owing to its
quickly drying and hardening into an elastic varnish on
exposure to the air, is largely used by painters and others.
After expressing the oil, an oil cake remains, which is used for
fattening cattle. Linseed meal, made out of the powdered cake,
is used for a variety of purposes. If our export of live cattle
ever attains to great dimensions, a demand will be created for
oil cake, owing to the fact that a supply sufficient for the
voyage would occupy comparatively small space, and that the
cake possesses highly fattening qualities; but to the fibre the
farmer must mainly look for his profit.


THE SOIL AND ITS PREPARATION.
v P 1 eparation of the soil for the flax crop requires to
be well done. A slovenly farmer will never make a successful
flax grower. Before entering into details of how and when
this work should be performed, it may be advisable to give a
brief outline of the chemical composition of soils. They are
distinguished according to the proportion of clay, sand, and
lime which they possess, thus
(1) Argillaceous soils, possessing little or no calcareous
matter, and above 50 per cent, of clay.
(2) Loamy soils, containing from 20 to 50 per cent of
clay.
(3) Sandy soils, not more than 10 per cent of day.
(4) Marly soils, 5 to 20 per cent of calcareous matter.
(5) Calcareous soils, more than 20 per cent of carbonate of
lime.
(6) Humus soils, in which vegetable mould abounds.
The subsoil varies in composition, and often differs
from that on the surface, but a superficial soil of triable loam
on a retentive clay subsoil, in gently undulating country, is
the paradise of the flax grower. Flax is a lover of well drained
land, but in ? sour ? soils an uneven crop is produced, and the
fibre is of less value in comsequence. In the parish of
and surrounding districts of Victoria, soils similar to & No. 2
predominate. Sandy soils (No. 3) are not plentiful, except in
the vicinity of granite ranges, but of all sandy soils those in
part composed of granite grit are the most worthless. If
resting on a clay subsoil, they, however, suit the requirements
of certain cl.isses of vignerons fairly well. Humus soils (No.
6) are not so well adapted for the production of fibre, but
they give larger yields of seed. Russian flax growers in the
?black earth? provinces of the Don devote rich vegetable
moulds purely to seed production for home consumption and
export. Heavy land, such as No. 1, if naturally well drained,
and properly pulverised and ploughed, gives a good yield of
coarse fibre. Land of the latter character is not, therefore, to
be despised in the absence of any better, but the grower will'be
unwise to cultivate it if he has soil more easily worked and
better calculated to produce the exact thing he aims at growing.
Generally speaking, any soils capable of yielding good crops of
wheat and oats will produce excellent crops of flax, but, as a
matter of choice, deep loams are the best; sandy loams next?
if cultivated in a suitable manner; and well worked clays
follow. In all these instances a clay subsoil is an advantage.
Experiments made by me on a small scale in various parts
of Victoria enable me to give that as my experience. In
mest respects the system of flax growing followed in the
Province of Ulster will suit here, but there are a few things


peculiar to our soils and climate which require to be properly
understood before we can formulate our methods to suit local
circumstances. For instance, soil impregnated with certain
mineral substances will not suit to excavate a dam in, and
certain of our trees, whose bark possess tanning properties,
would damage the colour of the flax fibre if brought into
contact with it. Lime, or water containing lime particles,
would in the ?retting? process extract from the fibre too-
much of that oily matter which is essential to the successful
bleaching of newly manufactured linen goods. A dam made
in soil showing a large percentage of oxide of iron would,
likewise, prove unsuitable for a ?steep.? It would render the
fibre as reel as a fox. In the absence of other water more
suitable for retting,? it might do fairly well, but the flax
steeped in it would not command the top price in the market.
This raattef will be more fully dealt with under the heading of
? retting.? So much of general matter in reference to soils.
In Ulster flax is not sown on lea or on freshly ploughed soil.
It usually follows a crop of wheat or oats in fallowed ground?
deeply ploughed. In the recognised rotation of Ulster crops
it comes third ; but here, where the lea is often as friable
as a loam, this system need not be exactly followed; care,
however, must be exercised to prevent the crop growing as if
? drilled.? One home rotation is this :
(1) Land in lea, or fertilised for root crops.
(2) Wheat or oats.
(3) Flax.
(4) Oats.
(5) Loot crops, for which land is fertilised.
(6) Wheat crop, with which grass seed and clover are sown.
The land is then rested for a number of years. By resting
land the fertility of the soil is in a measure restored, so the-
home system of rotations is quoted more to explain how it
acts than tosuggest that it should be followed here. Except
in the Ballarat and the Lancefield districts of Victoria, I have,
I regret to say, seen no high-class farming carried on here.
The general system is purely one of exhaust, and this cannot
continue for ever. Soil intended for flax growing must be
pulverised as fine as an onion plot. If the land has been
in fallow for some months, a second light ploughing should
be given it, but in sandy loams excessive ploughings do
more harm than good. The great thing is to prepare a clean,
fine seed-bed, pulverise the soil well, and roll it with a heavy
roller. Flax likes a well cultivated, but firm soil. In my native
country wet and spuey soils predominate, hence they require to
be well drained and to be ploughed as often as four times to
prepare them for the flax crop. There the soil bakes as hard as
sun-dried bricks, and before it can be freed of noxious weed s
great labour is necessary. Our soils do not present onedhir^


the difficulty to the cultivator that the ? home? soils do. Viewed
from this point, the colonial farmer has the advantage on his
side. When the soil is rendered quite fine, it is rolled, and is
then ready for the seeding. The seed is sown broadcast on the
roiled land, is lightly harrowed in with a seed or brush harrow,
and must be rolled immediately after harrowing is finished.
Carernust be taken not to sow in moist weather, or when the
soil is in the slightest degree damp. In Victoria, the Wan*
garatta, Benalla, and Goulburn Valley districts, and many
parts of Gippsland, are eminently suitable for flax growing *
but the difficulty is to sufficiently impress on growers the
necessity?absolute necessity?to follow sure and recognised
methods of cultivation and preparation of the crop Once the
proper system is mastered, there is nOt much more difficulty
in growing good flax than m producing first-class cereals. It
is with a desire to assist beginners 1 offer this advice; Grow
small areas at first, and do all the necessary work well.
THE TIME TO SOW.
Experience must be the sole guide as to the proper time
'to sow. The season for sowing is by no means uniform
throughout the colonies, and consequently we must form our
own theories on this important branch of flax culture. In
Victoria, the Wimmera, Richardson, and Boort districts, for
instance, are very early, the Rodney and Goulburn Valley a
little later, while the Oxley and Ovens follow next in order.
Malmsbury, Kyneton, Wandin, and similarly elevated districts,
and a considerable area of the coastal country subject to
late rains, come last in order. When the Goulburn Valley
wheat harvest is ended, the oat crops in and around Malmsbury
will only be coming into ear. Hence to lay down any hard
and fast rule applicable to all districts would be impossible.
Generally speaking, all the plains north of the Dividing Ranges,
not more than 400 ft. above sea level, might be sown in
August or even earlier. They are rarely subject to frosts, and
such slight ones as they occasionally have will in no way affect
the young flax plant. It is hardier than the young potato.
Light medium soils and sandy loams in northern areas should
be sown as early as circumstances will admit, jf the land be
in a fit state ?not saturated with moisture. The March frosts
in England do not, but in Scotland they do sometimes, injure,
fhe early sown crops of flax. Flax is considered a very healthy
crop in ever} 7 country where grown, and is capable of resisting
such moderate frosts as would blacken a potato crop. 1 have
experimented with small plots in a great, many parts of
Victoria, and I invariably found I had the heaviest, fibre
-from the early sown, that is, sown from July- to middle of
August. I should advise that seeding be done sufficiently early


to admit of the seed bolls forming on the stalk before the hot
winds commence. They frequently wither the young leaves,
and give the crop an appearance of 'premature ripeness.
THICK AND THIN SOWING.
Sow thick for fibre; thin for seed. About bushels wilt
suffice in the one case, and in the other. The quantity
contained in a bushel is not arrived at by weight, but by dry
measure, t.e., 2gal. 1 peck, 4 pecks 1 bushel, and 8 bushels 1
quarter. The object to be attained in thick sowing is to cause
the stalks to spindle up long and thin, and, if possible, with
only one or two seed capsules on top Thin sowing enables
the grower to procure a heavy crop of seed, but a coarse and
inferior class of fibre. When sown thin, the plant throws out
numerous branches, and produces from each of them a prolific
crop of seed. Considerable skill is required in sowing flax
broadcast. Persons who have practised lucerne cultivation will
easily manage it; but the seed must be very evenly distributed,
so that the crop when grown from it may be uniform in fineness.
Good sound seed is of a bright colour, plump, shining, and
heavy. Riga and Belgian are the two varieties best suited to
our requirements. The Belgian does best in heavy loams, but
Riga suits all soils ; it grows vigorously and tall, and produces
a good strong fibre. Broken and inferior seeds should not be
purchased; and in order to make certain that the seed is good,
a simple test will suffice. Get, say, fifty seeds, and place them
between two damped pieces, of flannel. If kept moderately
moist they will germinate in a few days, when the grower can
form an idea as to the character of his sample Flax is a new
industry in the colony, and only a limited number of seedsmen
possess any idea as yet respecting the seed. A good seedsman
should be an expert ?able to advise as to the varieties best
suited to certain soils, and so on. The utmost care must be
exercised in selecting the seed. Bad seed is dear at any price ;
and the variety sown should be suitable to the class of soil in
which it is intended to be grown.
WEEDING.
If the soil intending for the flax crop has been well pulverised,
and cleaned of weeds before the seed is sown, weeding may not
be necessary. Our soils do not produce noxious weeds to the
same extent as the home soils do. Before the flax crop attains a
height of six inches it is found a good plan to employ a number
of boys to go over it and remove any such growths. This should
be done in damp weather and in a very careful manner, so as
not to injure the young plant If pressed down by the foot of a
heavy man it takes time to recover its upright position. Tho
utmost I can recommend is great care in weeding.


PULLING.
To determine the exact time when flax should he pulled is a
matter of great nicety Those who leave the plant until the
seed is thoroughly ripened will have a harsh and inferior class of
fibre. The best time to pull is just a little before the seed is
fully ripe. The ripe state is indicated by the stalk becoming a
yellow colour. The colour of the seed boll is, however, the
best indication when pulling should be commenced. I advise
growers to do this work before the seed boll has actually
attained its brownish tinge. Flax pulled at this stage, and
immediately afterwards steeped with the seed adhering to it,
gives a nice lustrous fibre, and commands a higher price than
if allowed to more fully mature. Flax intended for fibre must
not be reaped by the scythe or mowed; it should be pulled
Thresher.
by hand. An experienced puller would harvest from one
quarter to half an acre per day. The butts must be even.
Short stalks, if in any quantity, should be left to ripen for seed.
Home growers usually tie the pulled flax in small bundles?
about one-third the size of wheat sheaves. Rushes or straw
will do well for binding the sheaves; but flax itself must not
be used for that purpose. Neatness in binding will result
in less difficulty in handling the crop after retting. Moreover
a fibre of uniform length will make a better sample, and
command a ready sale in the market.
RIPPLING.
Flax intended for seed must be permitted to become
thoroughly ripe. The seed bolls will assume a greenish brown
tinge when ir. is in that condition. The crop is pulled in the


ordinary way, but must be ?stocked? for a few days, like
wheat. It is then in a fit state for rippling. This is performed
with a rippling comb by some growers, others lightly thresh
the sheaves, and a more primitive plan still is to hit the heads
against a large stone. A rippling comb is made in this way?
a number of long spikes are driven through a thick board.
The spikes are thicker next the block, into which they are
fastened, than at the point. To a slight extent the apparatus
resembles an inverted garden rake. A small handful of flax,
expanded fan shape, is drawn through these spikes, and by
that means the seed bolls are removed. If this work is care-
fully done the fibre will not be injured. The sheaves are
re-tied and retted in the ordinary way.
Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of Elizabeth street, North
Melbourne, have manufactured a cheap machine for removing
the seed bolls from the sheaves. It does this part of the
harvesting operation well, and reduces the cost of rippling to
4s. 9d. per acre. All flax growers should possess one of these
cheap appliances.
RETTING.
Retting and rotting mean precisely the same thing in the
language of the flax grower. They each refer to that peculiar
fermentative process which . the flax plant undergoes in water,
and which is needed to release the glutinous matter from the
fibrous and wood} f . The latter two, in their turn, are separated
from one another by two mechanical operations, known as
? breaking? and ?scutching.? Scientists and experimenters in
various Continental countries have suggested other means by
which this work might be accomplished; but without the fer-
mentative process of steeping and ?grassing,? all mechanical
means of separating the fibre have proved nnsuccessful. In
France and one part of Belgium, a new plan of maceration has
been tried with partial success; but, as it is not an improvement
on the method of retting which obtains in Ulster, and is unsuited
to our requirements, no good purpose will be served by referring
to it more than in a passing way for the present. It is necessary
to explain the retting method very fully, it being the most par-
ticular work in connection with the flax crop.
Flax must be retted in still , not in running water , and the
softer it is the better. The fibre is considerably affected by the
colour of the vegetable or mineral qualities which impregnate
the water in which it is immersed, hence care shotild be exercised
in selecting a dam in a proper situation, so that objectionable
qualities in the water, imparted by the soil, may bo avoided.
Soil containing a large percentage of lime or iron matter ; will
not suit. Lime extracts too much of the oily matter from the
fibre, thereby rendering if harsh. Iron discolours it. In the


"Wangaratta districts of Victoria these drawbacks in the way of
impurities will not present themselves to the grower, but in the
Wimmeraandthe�oortcountrylimemakesitspresencefelt. Adam
capable of holding an acre (Irish) of flax is usually constructed
on this scale ?length, 50ft. ; width, 1 Oft.; and depth, 4�ft. to
sLft. Heavier yields might render it necessary to not bmit the
dimensions of the dam to the exact Irish proportions. The soil
most liked for dam making is a stiff blue clay. For some reason
which I am unable to explain, flax retted in a dam of this
description produces a soft, lustrous ? blay ? fibre, much
admired by flax buyers.
The sheaves are put into the dam in a position nearly
vertical, and are pressed as close against each other as is
practicable to press them ?without going to any excessive
trouble to do the work in that way, A number of small dams
are to be preferred to one large one, for the grower must not
continue adding fresh flax to the ?ret-pit ? day by day. Were
he to do so, an irregular system of fermentation would set in,
and one part of the crop would be fully retted while the other
was only undergoing that process. When the dam is filled with
sheaves, a light covering of rushes or straw is given it; logs,
stones, or other heav} r substances are placed on top, so as to
keep the sheaves completely under the water. In our warm
climate fermentation commences quickly. It is known by the
sheaves rising, and the water showing a great number of small
bubbles caused by escaping gases. Fresh logs or stones must
be added. The time the retting occupies varies from five to
twelve days, according to the ripeness of the plant, the state of
the atmosphere, and the softness of the water. The dam should
be examined hourly during the fermenting stage. A good plan
is to withdraw a few stalks from the sheaves in several parts of
the dam, and when the fibre for the full length of those stalks
separates freely from the inner or ivoolly portion, out the crop
must come at once. A few hours more would over-rot, and
possibly spoil, the whole crop. The sheaves are then withdrawn
from the dam and carted on to some green, well grassed pas-
tured land, to be spread and dried. Though to ret in still water
is the proper and recognised system, there are two remarkable
exceptions. The flax growers of Courtrai, in Belgium, steep
their crops in crates in the Lys, a very slow-running river ; and
owing to some peculiar properties the waters of the ? golden
Lys,? as it is called, possess, the most beautiful specimen of
fibre in the world is produced from flax retted in it. It is of a
lovely cream colour, fine and lustrous. From it exquisite lace
is made; but quite apart from the peculiar ? art ? of retting the
Flemish growers employ, their whole system of flax culture
from the seed to the fibre ?is a study in itself. Their fibre
frequently realises prices ranging from �l2O to �IBO per ton.
The other instance where flax is successfully retted in slowly


flowing water is in Courtnay, in the province of Ulster. Stakes
are driven into the side of a river not so much affected by the
current, the sheaves are piled in, fermentation takes place, and
magnificent fibre is the result. Certainly the water has much
to do with the good character of the fibre in the last mentioned
case. Specimens of it realised very large prices?equal to the
Belgian, I have been told. The water in which flax has been
steeped should not be permitted, immediately after the flax is
withdrawn, to escape into any watercourse frequented by fish.
It would kill them; and Ulster flax growers are often fined
heavily for transgressing in that way. If it can be so arranged,
it is a good plan to construct the dam in such a position that the
water remaining in it after retting can be allowed to flow* over
the adjoining land. It is a capital fertiliser ; but in a few weeks?
time it will do no harm to let the water flow where it likes. It
is advisable, however, to carefully study these little matters
before constructing a retting dam for flax.
SPREADING- AND DRYING: The Ulster System?D�Y-
lNG IN SHEAF: The Scottish Method.
Immediately the flax sheaves are taken out of the ? steep,?
Ulster growers remove them to some recently mowed meadow
land or well grassed field, to be spread and dried. This system
of drying the recently retted flax is termed ?bleaching,? in
contradistinction to drying the sheaves on end, the Scottish
I shall explain both systems separately. The Ulster
system is to be preferred, where it can be conveniently prac-
tised, �.<?., where the pasture land is well grassed and free of
weeds or any substances likely to discolour or impurify the
stalks. In the northern areas, owing to the soil being sometimes
exposed and the grass in seed, the Scottish method is the better;
but either plan will answer well enough if proper care be
exercised in doing the work pertaining to it well.
THE ULSTER SYSTEM.
Recently mowed meadow land, being free of weeds, makes
a good ?spread.? If other grassed lands are used, it is necessary
to run over the field with a scythe and cut down and remove all
tall weeds, long grasses, and rushes. The sheaves are then
dropped from a farm waggon at short distances apart. The
spreader takes one in both hands, places it against his knees,
and permits the stalks to fall in a neat thin swath after him.
The stalks, being slippery, part from each other very easily. In
this way row follows row until the whole sheaves are spread ;
but the heads of the succeeding must be about seven inches
apart from the butts of the preceding swath, so as to prevent
the stalks tangling. A few days of our warm climate will


suffice to thoroughly dry the whole lot. The proper time to lift
and re-bundle it is when the stalks begin to ?bow.? The fibre
contracts and slightly separates from the ?boon,? the woody
inside, and in so doing forms a slight ?bow.? The sheaves may
be tied in smaller bundles than oats or wheat, and bands of
rushes or string will suit for the work. They should then be
carted into a barn or shed, or put into a stack; but in the latter
case the stack must be so constructed and thatched as to preclude
any damage from moisture. Flax mellows and scutches better
after it is stacked, than if scutched immediately after it is lifted
from the ? spread.?
THE SCOTTISH METHOD.
The Scottish method is to take the sheaf, when withdrawn
from the steep, and place it on end to dry. The operation is
performed in this way : The spreader draws the band up close
to the seed bolls, where it is quite loose, yet sufficiently tight to
keep the bundle together. He then draws the sheaf round his
leg, and, withdrawing his leg quickly, permits the bundle to
remain in the shape of the olden kind of bee?s cap ?hollow in
the centre, erect, and held together at the top by the band. In
a few days the sheaves are examined and turned inside out. In
this manner flax van be dried fully as well as by bleaching on
the ground. The Scottish system has much to recommend it so
far as flax drying in the northern areas is concerned, and generally
where clean, well-grassed pasture land is not available. The
other operations of lifting and stacking are precisely similar to
those referred to in the Ulster system. Properly dried flax, if
carefully stacked, can be allowed to remain for years without
being scutched. It will not deteriorate in any way.
BREAKING AND SCUTCHING BY HAND.
Strictly speaking, these two important operations come with-
in the province of the scutch mill proprietor, and are rough pro-
cesses of manufacture, but frequently the grower does the work
himself. In the latter case the flax cultivator can, at a compara-
tively trifling outlay, equip himself with a few primitive imple-
ments capable of preparing a crop of 2 or 3 acres for the market.
I desire to make a few remarks regarding machinery, which
I hope will not be taken in bad part. In young colonies
there is a strong tendency to procure expensive machinery
at the initiation of a new industry, when, as a matter of
fact, less costly appliances would answer the purpose equally
well for a time. Want of experience causes some to act im-
prudently in this way, while in other instances machinery
vendors rush their goods on the market without due regard to the
capacity of the district to profitably utilise them. The less of


?dead stock ? one has in these day of high interest, the better
it is for him.
Where flax cultivation is carried on in a particular district
on an extensive scale, it is of primary importance that it should
possess a good flax mill under the control of competent flax
workers. One person who erects a place of this kind can do the
necessary work of fibre preparation for a large community of
growers, and that, too in a more efficient and economical manner
than any individual member of it could do the work for himself.
A proper division of labour in this direction leads to cheapness
and economy . It is cheaper for a person, for instance, to purchase
his boots ready made than to make them himself. A flax mill
can be erected at comparatively small outlay, or much money
may be needed for the purpose, according to the intention to-
IxxEiiiO� of Flax Mill.
have finely-made and elaborate appliances, or otherwise. I
shall first refer to the cheap appliances?good enough in their
way for a grower of a few acres of crop.
THE HAND BREAKER.
This implement is made to be worked by hand like a small
chaffcutter or mangle. It resembles the last mentioned article,
with this difference, however, chat the mangle has two smooth
wooden rollers, whereas the breaker has two or more ?fluted
ones. Others have three fluted rollers, the middle one largest
and stationary, the upper and under ones moveable, and so
weighted and regulated as to suit their distance apart to the
quantity of flax passing between them. The flax is fed into
these machines from a table in precisely the same method a


laundress employes to deal with lier linen. I frequently use my
own mangle for small samples of properly retted fibre; but
absence of ?fluting? gives additional labour to break the fibre.
There are simpler ways still of breaking the fibre, but it is not
necessary to refer to them.
HAND SCUTCHER.
Hand scutching is a simple method of reducing the
? breaked ? flax to fibre. The work is performed by two
implements?one known as a scutching ?handle,? the other
as a scutching ?board.? The ?board? is composed of any
heavy block of wood resting on the ground, and to which is
firmly nailed, in an upright position, a piece of plank about 4ft.
to sft. in height, Ift. in width, and 1 in. to l�in. in thickness.
A notch is cut in this board near the top, into which a handful
of flax is placed and firmly held by the left hand, while it is
hit in a downward, sloping direction b} r the ?handle? before
referred to, and this operation is continued until all the ?boon ?
or ?shoves? are removed from the stalks, and only the soft,
lustrous fibre remains. The ?handle? resembles a butcher?s
meat chopper, is very thin in the blade, about 14in. in length,
-and is usually made of very hard wood. Jarrah makes a good
implement of this description. These two articles should not
?cost more than 15s. During weather not suitable for outdoor
work, a number of hands with these appliances can prepare
a considerable quantity of fibre, and thereby save ? broken
time.? Fibre prepared in this way does not realise as good
a price as when scutched by the improved machinery which I
shall describe further on; but there is less waste in ?tow,? and
taking increased quantity as against higher value, matters
about balance, and therefore one method has not much
advantage over the other. Hand scutching is superior to
machine in producing fibre nearly the full length of the stalk ;
but it is only to small growers , or to those who experiment
mostly in order to find out the suitability of the industry,
that this slow method is really useful.
THE POWER BREAKER AND SCUTCHER.
These machines can be driven by horse, steam, or water
power.
The latest improvement in flax breakers is one constructed
with only four iron rollers. This machine has a kind of double
action, which enables those four rollers to break the stalk as
fine as a large number would do it. Another breaker, manu-
factured by Messrs. Cliff and Bunting, of Elizabeth street,
Melbourne, has fourteen fluted iron rollers in all. Some of
these rollers are closer in the fluting than the others, and


lionco one set of them breaks the fibre roughly, while the
remaining ones reduce it still finer, and ?buff? the flax, i.e.,
remove from it so much of the ?boon? as a good breaker is
capable of removing. It is more easily scutched then.
The power scutcher consists of a revolving shaft, which
must be set very true, and to it are affixed a number of arms or
blades, each of which terminates in a wooden knife made of
beech wood. The shaft is similar in some respects to the on�
. used in the old style of flour mill to work the mill stones and
other parts of the machinery. There may be onlv one scutcher
on the shaft, or there may be several, regulated according to
Flax Beeakee.
driving power employed. The shaft passes through a frame, of
iron or wood, as the case may be, and the arms revolve parallel
with an iron partition, where the workman places a handful of
flax, and holds it until the knives beat all the shoves out of it.
dins is quickly done, as the revolutions are at the rate of 300 to
400 per minute. When a ? hank ?is scutched, it is put on one
side until a bale of 14lb. accumulates. It is then tightly tied,
and is ready for the market. None but skilled hands should be
employed at this work. A machine of this class, well adapted
to the requirements of Australian flax growers is also made by
Uift and Bunting. A beginner would waste more fibre in.


tl tow ? than what he would probably clean. Ulster scutchers
are wonderfully expert at this business.
This completes the information on flax culture. I shall
on refer to the state of the industry in Russia, Ulster,
Belgium, and America; the products made from flax fibre ; the
best markets for sale, and the general prospects of flax growing
in these colonies. It has been truly stated by a distinguished
writer that flax ministers to almost every human use, save food.
I am well aware that many people consider it impolitic to impart
too much information regarding the industry in all its features.
I differ from them in my views. The farmers in these colonies
should have the fullest possible information supplied to them,
and the interests of a few monopolists, who might probably
desire to ? farm ? the farmer, must not prevail. The man who
Scutcher.
wants to run a city oil mill will probably advise them to grow
for seed, not because it would benefit a rural district, but
because it might give him the opportunity to extract the ? oil,?
while the poor devil of a farmer must remain satisfied with the
? powdered cake.? Recollect, the tobacco industry in Victoria
under a ?knock out ? price brought the growers to the bed-rock
of impecuniosity, while it enabled at least one manufacturer of
King River tobacco to bequeath �BO,OOO for his survivin (r
relatives to fight over. Think of that when humbug is in the
air! I know that no business is, or could be, conducted on
purely philanthropic or benevolent principles, and I would hail
with great satisfaction any enterprising capitalist, in the city or
elsewhere, who embarked his money in profitably promoting
those rural industries capable of adding to the prosperity of


these great colonies; but we must carefully examine men?s
motives, so as to ascertain whether the interests of the indi-
vidual or the general body of toilers are to remain paramount
in regard to a particular industry.
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES ARE DOING.
1 shall now refer to the condition of the industry in other
countries, and the first of these I shall select will be Russia.
Russian growers stand at the bottom of the list for fibre
production. Their fibre realises the lowest price in the home
markets, but a great deal of it is used, notwithstanding, for
the manufacture of the rougher class of textile fabrics.
Russian growers harvest excellent seed. Belfast seed merchants
do a large trade with the Baltic ports in connection with the
importation of that variety known as ?Riga.? It might be
called the ?poor man?s? seed, for it suits all classes of soils.
The Riga seed is ripened to perfection, and it is well to recollect
that where the grower permits the seed to thoroughly ripen
he cannot expect a good, soft , and lustrous class of fibre. This
accounts, to some extent, for the low value placed on Russian
fibro compared with Dutch and Belgian. In Belgium the
production of seed is only a secondary consideration. lam

Journal,? volume XIY., January to June, 1893.
Russian Flax Industries.
? Considerable attention, ? says the Belgian Consul-
General at Moscow, ?appears to be devoted to this industry,
and the cultivation is of great importance to the rural
population, who are engaged in the preparation of these
textiles at a period of the year when other agricultural occupa-
tions are impracticable. The cultivation of flax and hemp is
now substituted for that of wheat, which by reason of the
na tire of the soil is not so profitable. The fields devoted to
flax growing occupy an extent of between 1,200,000 and
1,500,000 dessiatine (dessiatine equals 2-7 acres), according to
the agricultural returns of the last decennial period 1882-91,
and the annual yield of fibre about 18,000,0001b., or nearly
6,000,000cwt., of which 4,000,000cwt. are exported, and the
balance is devoted to the requirements of the rural population.
? In the black earth provinces flax is principally grown with
a view to the seed harvest. In other than black earth provinces,
the cultivation is confined to two districts, where the production
of the textile attains about 60 per cent, of the total quantity
produced in Russia. The first of these regions is situated in
the west, and embraces the provinces of Yitabsk, Kovno,
Livonia, Pskov, and Smolensk. The second, which is of much


greater extent, embraces at tlie east the provinces of Vladimir,
Vologda, Viatka, Kostroma, Nijni-Novgorod, Perm, Tver,
Jarslow.
? The yield in 1891 was not a very satisfactory one in the
provinces of the extreme north, in the east, and in part of
the west, in that particular district of the flax cultivation
known as stanetz. The quantity of flax harvested amounted
to 3,134,000cwt., and of hemp to 1,936,000cwt., and these
amounts show as regards hemp a decided falling off when
compared with the corresponding figures of 1890.
? Flax and hemp are sold by sample, and the goods are sent
abroad from the place of production by the cheapest route, the
prices quoted being f.o.b. at Eevel. Libau and Eevel are not
flax markets, but serve only as ports of shipment. At Pernau
the flax trade has maintained its old character, and is in the
hands of a few merchants, who by carefully inspecting and
sorting obtain a high price for their consignments abroad. Eiga
does not appear to enjoy a very high reputation. The shipments
from Archangel come from the provinces of Viatka and Vologda.
Flax and hemp forwarded by rail are principally sent to Ger-
many by the frontier station at Vierzbolow, and the flax sent in
this way comes almost exclusively from Pskov, Eiga, Ostrow,
and Dunaborg. Ostrow and Pskov are the most important
markets of the province of Pskov.
? The Ostrow market sends abroad from 10 to 15 percent, of
the total Eussian exports, and the region which supplies this
market comprises the district of Ostrow, Opotchetz, Norovtcheff,
and part of Pskov and Porschow, where the harvests of the last
two years have yielded 500,000cwt. The Pskov market receives
flax from the districts of Pskov, Ostrow, Porschow, Opotchetz,
and Norovtcheff; from Vens, Dorpat, and Valk, in the province
of Livonia, and, finally, from Gdow and Longa, in the province
of St. Petersburg.
? The merchants of Eiga, Pskov, and St. Petersburg, as a
rule, have no direct relations with the producers, but purchase
their supply of flax from experts, who bring it to the various
fairs. The flax from Pskov market is principally exported to
Austria-Hungary. The other important markets of the western
region of flax production are those of Viazma, Ejew, and Sit-
chefka, where purchases are made, for the greater part, for the
interior and the local spinning factories. In the eastern flax
producing district, the principal fairs are held at Melinki and
Eibinsk.
? The unsatisfactory quality of Eussian flax is due to the
almost primitive methods of preparation.
? During the two years 1890 and 1891, the amount of flax
exported to foreign countries was respectively 4,000,000cwt. and
3, )00,000cwt., and of flax tow 378.000cwt. and 442,000� wt. Of
the flax exported 37 percent, went to Germany, 35 per cent, to


the United Kingdom, 18 per cent, to Fiance, and 10 percent,
to Belgium.
?Hemp was exported to the extent of 1,220,000cwt. in
1890, and 1,280, OOOcwt. in 1891 ; in the latter year the greatest
share of the quantity exported was on account of Germany, the
exact proportion being 07 per cent, of the total; the United
Kingdom took 19 per cent.; France, 2 per cent. and Belgium,
1 per cent.?
It will be noticed from the foregoing report r�f the Belgian
Consul-General that Russia exports a very large quantity of
badly prepared fibre_ to the United Kingdom, Germany, and
other countries ; and if we Australians, with our magnificent soil
and climate, cannot beat those rye-bread eaters in excellent flax
production, I shall consider myself unworthy the name of a
Britisher, which I highly esteem.
The Flax Industry in Ulster.
Though flax culture can claim a great antiquity, its intro-
duction into Ulster may be said to date from the arrival of that
revered Frenchman, Crommelin, and his little band of
countrymen, in 1678. The industry was not, however, unknown
prior to that time, for ?Campion?s Annals? states linen was
much worn by the ancient Irish, and in the Brehon Laws the
brughaids, or farmers, were obliged to learn and practise the
cultivation of flax. Louis Crommelin, on his expulsion from
France, settled in Lisburn, in the province of Ulster, introduced
the art of linen weaving, and by every means in his power strove
to improve the condition of the people amongst whom he came
to permanently reside. A splendid monument attests his fame?
i.e., the flourishing industries from Larne to Lurgan he was the
means of creating. At the present time flax growing is almost
ex* lusivejy confined to this one province ot Ireland. "Various-
reasons have been assigned for the reluctance of the sister pro-
vinces?Munster, Leinster, and Connaught?to embark in flax
growing. The land is superior in those provinces to that of
Ulster, and the southern people have a great object lesson in
what the northern folk have accomplished in the manufacture of
textile fabrics. My own opinion is that the south of Ireland
people were, until recently, unjustly treated in connection with
their system of land tenure ; for they are not wanting in dash
and enterprise, and. moreover, they are warm-hearted, generous,
and high-spirited.
Tbe season of 1893 was an unusually good one for flax
growers in Ulster. The annual report of the Flax Supply Asso-
ciation for that year states : ?? Trie yields are exceptionally good,
and the fact that we must go back thirty years to find a parallel
gives rise to a host of reflections, but* one may he enough at
and it is in reference to the cry that the country is


� flaxed out. This idea must be abandoned, when it is seen
that, without any special intervention, the crops of thirty years
ago can be repeated.?
In the city of Belfast alone, out of a total of 265,000 inhabi-
30,000 persons are actively employed in the linen and
spinning in addition to another large army of workers in
the ship-building yards near by. The linen industry may be
said to have indirectly assisted in promoting the ship-building.
For 1892 the average yield was 22-27 stones, and that for
1893 34-43 stones per acre, therefore the one season?s increase
on the other was no less than 54-60 per cent, per acre.
The report gives the yield for each province : ?Ulster,
32 30 ; Munster, 38 39 ; Leinster, 56-33 ; and Connaught, 64-42
stones per acre. The average price per stone was Bs. 84d.
Taking the average yield at 53 stones per acre, the average
price would be �23 Is. 6d. per acre, which must be looked upon
as a highly satisfactory return to the grower, Messrs. Wilson
and Son, of Ballymena, wrote me that they purchased one crop
which realised �34 4s. per acre, and as the total cost of seeding
to scutching was only �7 per acre, the net sum realised in this
instance would be �27 4s. per acre. With proper care and
attention, Victorian growers should find no difficulty in attaining
a like result.
The quantity of flax locally grown was only equal to two-
fifths of the requirements of the linen mills, and as a consequence
three-fifths of the fibre utilised by the manufacturers of textile
fabrics had to be imported from foreign countries, principally
from the Russian ports on the Baltic Sea. Germany and Bel-
gium procure their imports from the same country.
The number of spindles in active work in all Ireland during
1893 was 884,642, and in England and Scotland under 294,000.
The English and Scottish industries seem to be more confined to
spinning yarn than to weaving linen ; and to meet the demand
of all classes of manufacturers, close on 16,000,000 stones of flax
fibre are imported annually from other countries. The report of
the Flax Supply Association states that regret is felt at the
manufacturers not being able to procure a quantity sufficient to
suit their purpose of Irish fibre, which means, of course, fibre
equal in character to the Irish product. This is encouraging
news to Victorians, who should be able to produce as good fibre
as their Ulster friends, were they to devote the necessary skill
and attention to the business. Experiments recently made near
Bridgewater-on-Loddon by Mr, Hugh M?Dougall convince me
most satisfactory results can be attained in the production of
first-class fibre. Mr. M?Dougall devoted great attention to Ids
crop, from seeding to retting, and he and Mr. G. W. Leslie, of
Laen, near Donald, certainly stand in the front rank as flax
growers, as far as Victoria is concerned. Samples of their
fibre were favourably commended by London experts.


~ The !? U �n iri ? article ? written b y Mr. Steele, in ? Cassell?s
iagazine, will give my readers a proper conception of what the
nax and textile industries have attained to in Ulster
The White Fields of Ulster.
. , h , ere are ma ?y P ar t3 of the United Kingdom where special
industries not only predominate, but where their presence is
perceptible over wide areas. Coal-fields make huge tracts of
country ; chemical works hang over parts of the Tyne and Clyde ?
the iron ore of the hurniss district makes ruddy many a field
and stream near Barrow and Ulverston ; and in "Ireland (in the
north) the ?white fields? of Ulster give special character to
andscapes near Lisburn and Lugan. The story of the manufac-
me or nax goes back many generations.
It is a story that has its romance. There have been Vice-

Ulster lias from Larne to Lurgan so much of the linen manufac-
ture located within its bounds ; and nothing strikes the traveller
more frequently than the sight of the fields whitened with its
linen spread out to bleach. Here and there are long broad
lines of white spread out on the grass that is of the greenest, and
the interlacing lines of emerald and white suggest huge ribbons
straggling in parti-coloured beauty on the earth.! And the
predominant industry in Ulster has put its mark on country and
on people.
In the great towns huge mills gather in their workers in
the same manner that the cotton mills in the Oldham districts do,
though the number for each is less, and there is more of Irish
vivacity in the workpeople.
Of the many processes in the mills, from ? roughing ? the
flax and ? heckling ? to the ? calendering? of the webs, it is not
needful to enter into detail; machines ?varied, costly, and
complicated ?do very much of the work ?machines for combing,
cleaning, preparing, spinning, washing, beetling, and many
other processes, are at work ; and by them the brown-hued flax
is pulled, sorted, straightened, wound, conducted, woven as warp
or weft, and so improved that it finally emerges as pure white
linen or damask. But away from the towns, in little valleys and
on rugged hill-sides, there is still the working of the hand loom.
Here is such an example of Irish industry: ?In-a little
hamlet not far from Armagh a main road runs unevenly over
the hills, by comfortable farmsteads, owned by descendants of
Scotsmen, who long ago settled in one part of Cromwell?s
?plantation,? and past one-storeyed thatched cottages, whose
whitewashed fronts are partially covered with climbing plants.
Just off from this ?not a stone?s throw?are two little
dwellings, one occupied by a weaver and his family, the chief
room of the adjoining dwelling being given up to the loom.
And here the weaver meets you, and with frank Irish courtesy
shows you his method of work, and the shuttle flies from his
busy hands as the web is woven.
It is a form of the linen industry that is being decreased
from year to year, for the mills are made more perfect in
machinery and larger in production, and in Ireland, as in the
other countries, the extent of the work of the hands is being
reduced by the application of steel and steam.
In some of its aspects this alteration is not an improvement ?
it is the removal of the small industries that give work to the
hamlets into the towns; but in Ulster, apart from Belfast, there
is not the aggregation of population in towns that there is in,
say, the cotton-districts of England; and the necessities of the
linen trade enforce the possession of green areas near the mills,
so that the white fields of Ulster minister alike to the purity of
the linen and the air of the towns near.
The predominant industry is not a highly paid one ; but the


workers in Lisburn and Lurgan exercise thrift as well as
industry, and in the villages where hand-weaving still survives
it is part of the occupation of the household; and the care of the
patch of land, of the cow, and the pig give employment that is
at least as much conducive to health as to economy of ex-
penditure.
In the same way that hand loom weaving has generally
ost ground, so also has the special work of handkerchief weaving
and of home stitching by hand, but they cannot be considered
extinct, though decaying.
In towns like Lisburn, in model establishments like Bess-
brook, and in the villages down into the County of Armagh the
men manufacture has its great seat. There are not only the
large warehouses and offices of the makers and merchants, but
the retail establishments are some of the finest of the buildings
that the great capital of the North of Ireland boasts.
It is an industry that employs its thousands of hands, as in
the case of the shipbuilding yards near; it is one of the most
distinct and ancient of the trades that centre there, and the
vastness of the capital it employs, the large employment it gives
o la >our, and the picturesqueness of its surroundings make one
ot the special, features of the North of Ireland those bleaching
lields which w'e have called the ? white fields of Lister.?
The Chemical Composition of the Flax Plant.
Professor Hodges, of Belfast, gives this as follows
Water - .... 50 . 64
Organic matter - - . 41-97
Ash ? 1-39
Ash per cent., dried ac 212deg. Fnhr., 3-20. One hundred
parts of Irish flax straw gave 0*53 of nitrogen. The ash con-
tains :
Potash .... 20 . 32
Soda ? _ _ _ 2?07
Chloride of sodium - . . 9-27
Lime - - . - 19-88
Magnesia - 4.95
Oxide of iron - 2-83
Sulphuric acid - . . 7.J3
Phosphoric acid - 10-24
Carbonic acid - - . - 10-79
Silica .... 12 . 80
It is to bo noted that the foregoing analysis shows a com-
paratively high percentage of lime in the composition of the flax
plant. Some few of our Victorian soils give evidence of a fairly
large percentage of iron matter, and I previously remarked that
iron matter and lime are undesirable in the clay banks of the


retting dam , though they are no harm at all in the soil in which
the grower intends to produce the flax plant. Avoid such soils
for a danv but rejoice at having such substances in moderate
proportions in your cultivation paddocks. It seems to me a
great pity that the Agricultural Department of each colony does
not make a systematic analysis of the various soils of the colony.
That of every district should be labelled for reference, and re-
tained in the Technological Museum. If one knows what the
chemical composition of the plant is, he will probably also know
that soil to produce that plant should contain somewhat similar
elements.
Sir Richard Kane gives an analysis of three kinds of soil
that were found by some members of the Royal Flax Improve-
ment Society of Ireland to be highly suited for flax culture :

Persons desirous of ascertaining the chemical composition
of their soils should forward average samples of them to Mr. Pear-
son, of the Victorian Department of Agriculture, for analysis. I
am quite certain many costly blunders would be avoided were this
idea more frequently acted upon. It has often struck me how
advantageous it would be were Mechanics? Institutes in up-country
towns more liberally with standard woiks in agriculture
and kindred subjects of the ? blue flowering ? flax plant.
Some writers assert that flax is an exhaustive ciop.
They are utterly wrong'. Irish flax growers maintain it is
the reverse ( vide the article on the Flax Industiy in Ulster).
My own experience is the same as that of the latter. I
have seen crop-sick land in my native county in Ulster give
a magnificent yield of good fibre. Our system of agricul-
ture, as carried on in this colony, is purely one of exhaustion ;
but when a home farmer speaks of ? exhausted soil he has in
his mind?s eye a country whose fields have for generations
yielded their kindly fruits to the husbandman under the coaxing
influences of all sorts of fertilisers and improved systems of agri-
culture, The richest soils on the globe will not stand perpetual


?cropping, though it has to be borne in mind some of our soils
have, after the lapse of countless ages, become so highly fer-
tilised through decaying ferns and other rich and dense vegeta-
tion, that they actually require to be ?toned down ? by heavy
and exhaustive cropping to fit them for flax production. We
see on a smaller scale an example of this in the case of an old
sheep fold. When first cultivated it gives a wonderful growth
of straw, but no grain. After several such crops have removed
the superabundance of rich elements, the soil becomes properly
-adapted to the growth of good cereals. On the other hand, we
must be generous to nature, which has endowed our virgin soils
with many properties that all the artifice of the home scientific
farmer can never more than temporarily supply to his worn out
lands. The Almighty has showered blessings on this land?a
most beautiful climate and the richest of soils ; yet His gifts are
abused, for the absence of frosts and the mildness of our seasons
have to some extent produced the tramp and the vagrant, whose
canopy is the sky o?erhead.
The Flax Industry in Belgium.
The best quality of fibre is that produced in Western Bel-
gium, but as Belgian growers devote the greatest possible care to
the industry?from the preparation of the soil to the manipula-
tion of the fibre for the finer classes of manufacture, such as
cambric and lace ?I should be setting up too high an ideal for
Australians to aim at were I to suggest that their system
might be followed in its entirety. For many reasons it is not
practicable, but at the same time no harm will ensue if we take
.an ? excursion ? amongst our Flemish friends. Belgium is re-
nowned for its beautiful, fine, cream-colored flax fibre, and Ulster
for its much admired ? blay.? Each country considers its colour
the better. I have seen both clases of these fibres, and I must
candidly admit that, from a purely artistic point of view,
I prefer the Belgian cream to the Ulster ? blay.? Ulster people
will admit no inferiority on the part of their fibre as regards
colour or anything eise, and, of course, where each party is
abundantly satisfied as to the superior merits of his product, I
may be permitted to express myself in the language of the in-
dividual in the ?Beggar?s Opera??
? Row happy would I be with either,
Were t?other dear charmer away.?
The Belgian cream-coloured fibre is produced in only one
part of Belgium, namely, in the district of which Courtrai is
the central town. This locality is traversed by the celebrated
? Golden ? Lys. It is a sluggish stream, but its waters are un-
equalled f"r steeping flax in. They possess some peculiar pro-
perties, which give to the flax its exquisite colour and lustre.
Becent boring operations show the bed of the river consists of


blue day several hundred feet in depth. At the same time I
have been shown samples from the Courtrai district not by any
means what I expected them to be. The sheaves .are retted in
crates,' anchored in the river ( rouisage au ballon), but the retting
is performed three times, as distinguished from the single
operation in pool or tank steeping, as it is variously
teimed. Telgian fibre frequently realises as high prices
as �2OO per ton, and a good crop in that country is
often of more value than the freehold on which it is
grown. The Flemish growers are amongst the best agri-
culturists in Europe. They have a regular system of rotation
of crops, and display wonderful skill in dealing with this pro-
duct. The soil is thoroughly prepared, only the best seed is
utilised, no weeds are permitted to interfere with the growth of
the young plant, and method and skill are applied to the general
work of flax culture. The appearance of the seed, its richness in
oil, the absence of all foreign odours indicating mustiness or bad
condition, purity, and germinating power, are duly considered.
Belgian growers pay no attention to the preservation of the seed.
Their aim is prime fibre, and they, in consequence, leave to those
districts better suited for seed production the cultivation of that
particular article of commerce. Some writers assert that to
steep in running streams is the correct way to ret flax. To
perform the work in that manner is purely exceptional. Persons
suggest that method display considerable ignorance of
the industry.
The following particulars furnished by Henry Wallace, of
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, respecting flax culture in
Belgium, a country where fibre of excellent quality is produced,
will be of special interest to flax growers. Mr. Wallace says :
Pursuant to instructions from the Department, I visited the main flax
growing districts in Belgium, of which the city of Courtrai is the geo-
graphical and commercial centre. The district does not vary greatly in
elevation nor in rainfall from the flax growing districts in Ireland. It has,
however, certain very decided advantages, some of which are peculiar to the
immediate location. The land is gently undulated, the soil in general a
friable loam of easy culture, resting on a porous subsoil. The price of
labour is lower than in Ireland, the higher temperature rendering the
destruction of weeds more easy ; while its proximity to the river Lys gives
an opportunity for retting unequalled in the world. The soil and the general
principles of this district bear a striking resemblance to the \ rairie States
of America. The whole region is under the most complete and thorough
system of cultivation, fences being used to enclose permanent pastures, and
the tillable land being under a most complete system of rotation. Belgian
soil gives an opportunity for a more varied rotation than in Ireland,growing,
as it does, wheat, rye, oats, barley, sugar beets, cloves, chicory, turnips, rape,
and small crops. The principles followed in adopting a rotation for any
particular farm are the same as those adopted by the Irish farmer. No
pains are spared in the preparation of the soil. The Belgian farmer is
practically a gardener, who wastes nothing, and leaves no spot with its
sources undeveloped, and to this end he uses whatever implement an&


whatever kind and amount of labour are necessary to attain the desired end.
When the flax is about two inches high, it is gone over by weeders, who
remove with the greatest care every weed, however small. At the end of the
weeding the fields are absolutely clean. The flax is grown for both seed and
fibie, and hence the plant is allowed to attain greater maturity than in
Ireland (where the pulling commences when the leaves begin to fall from
the lower part of the stem), but it is not allowed to attain' that degree of
maturity that fits the seed for sowing. Belgian seed is always a synonym
for poor seed. The pulling is done with extreme care, the root ends being
kept even ; and the straw is cured by stocking the handfuls. After this it
is tied up in ??beets,? or small bundles, and then placed in what are called
hedges, or ricks of bundles with plenty of air space between, and finally
stacked preparatory to retting in the liiver Lys, the sacred river of the
Belgian flax grower. The practical method of retting is the same as is
usually followed in other countries, and need not be repeated. It may be
well, however, to state that, from some cause or causes as yet not fully
understood, the water of the Lys, for a distance of seventeen miles, has the
peculiar effect of imparting to flax retted in it that extreme softness and fine-
ness of texture which can be produced nowhere else. Investigations made
(lining the past year show that it rests at this point on a bed of blue clay
found by boring at different points to be about 130 ft. thick. The investiga-
tions have not yet proceeded far enough to determine whether the peculiar
value of the water for retting purposes is due to this cause, or some other as
yet unknown. On this point it may be well to remark that in Ireland, where
the retting is done in stagnant water, a pit with blue clay in the bottom
produces fibre of greatly superior value when compared with that produced
by other pits in the same neighbourhood. The yield of fibre in Belgium
seldom exceeds 7001b. per statute acre. This is not greatly-different from
the yield in Ireland, when allowance is made for the wasting of fibre by the
retting in running water. In Holland, where both systems are followed, we
found that retting in water with the slightest possible current led to a
decrease of fibre of 15 per cent., while increasing the quality in about the
same ratio. The Belgian flax is mostly bought after thrashing (which is
< one by pounding the heads off with a block of wood without disarranging
the straw) by the fibre merchant, who supervises the rettim* process ? this
step being necessary to secure the application of the highest skill and the
greatest uniformity of product. The work of the farmer, therefore, ends
when he has separated the seed from the straw.
The foregoing article by Mr. Henry Wallace purports to be
a report on tlax culture in Belgium, made for the benefit of
United States flax growers. Except in a few details, the views
on flax culture expressed by Mr. Wallace do not materially differ
from my own. It is well to recollect that flax growing lias
scarcely yet become an acclimatised industry in the States* Mr.
Dodge, one of the best American experts, states in one of his
pamphlets that flax growing in America is but little practised or
understood by the generality of farmers. He tells us it is merely
in its experimental stage there. Now, the industry has con-
tinued for 250 years in Ulster, and the Huguenots, who intro-
duced flax growing and linen weaving into Ireland, were
recognised in their day as the most proficient manufacturers of
textile fabrics in the world. Through their friendly aid Lisburn
attained a degree of excellence in the manufacture of damask
which has not been equalled by any other community. Ulster
people have the transmitted experience of generations to o?uide


them, splendid flax associations to discuss and deni with, new
methods of flax culture, and a population devoted to the industry.
It is therefore safe to work on their lines In preference to those
of young countries gleaning information on the subject. Were
I sent to report on tea growing in China, I should form
some erroneous impressions, owing to my having no practical
knowledge of the subject to guide me. Many people are more
influenced by exceptional circumstances than by general and
well proved methods. On these grounds I infer Mr. Wallace
saw some things in connection with the flax industry which he did
not thoroughly understand. Mr. Wallace states :?? The flax is
grown (in Belgium) for both seed and fibre, and hence the plant
is allowed to attain greater maturity than in Irelandand a
little further on he says, ?but it is not allowed to attain that
degree of maturity that fits the seed for sowing. Belgian seed is
always a synonjun for poor seed.? The one extract in this
instance supplies the answer to the other. The Belgian
grower does not allow the seed to fully ripen, that is
to say, he takes it off for what it may be worth, for
purposes other than seeding. Ulster people ignore the
seed, because to secure ripe seed you must have a harsh,
coarse fibre. A few Belgian growers may ripple the seed in a
semi-green state to convert into oil cake. They take good care,
however, the stalk is not permitted to become over-ripe; so tbo
principles that both Ulster and Belgian growers act *pon, though
appearing to differ, are much the same, after all. But Mr.
Wallace is greatly in error in some features of flax culture. It
is the exception, and not the general rule, amongst Flemish
people to preserve the seed. All reputable Ulster writers on tho
flax industry express themselves to the contrary of Mr. Wallace.
No sensible Flemish grower would dream of damaging his care-
fully cultivated flax for the sake of an article not suitable for
seed. A few persons may follow the wrong system referred to
by Mr. Wallace, just in the same way as a few farmers in this
country, now and again, prefer self-sown wheat to that procured
from fallowed land. To ret in flowing streams is also a most
most exceptional circumstance. There are only two places
where growers do so, namely, in Courtrai in Belgium, and
in Courtany in Ulster. The reason is, those localities possess
streams whose waters are, for some unknown reason, admirably
suited to the retting process. The flax is not retted, however,
in the stream itself, but close to the bank, where the current is
almost imperceptible. The Belgians term this method of retting
rouisage au ballon , as distinguished from dam or still water
maceration. Belgians in the Courtrai district ret their flax in tho
? golden ? Lys, and certainly that river is well termed golden ;
a few shillings worth of this flax might be converted into �lO
worth of lace. Mr. Wallace is correct regarding the blue clay in
which to excavate a dam. Just as the wash dirt is to tho


Australian miner, so is the blue clay to the Ulster flax grower -
Both in a sense are golden to the respective parties who use them.
Beyond the few observations I have made, I see nothing ! other-
wise object to in Mr. Wallace?s report. There is one Grippsland
stream which seems to me capable of producing cream coloured
fibre like that of Courtrai,
In illustration of my contention that the flax industry is only
in its experimental stage in the United States, I give the follow-
ing extract from the Annual Report upon Fibre Investigations
for 1893, by Mr. Richards Dodge, Special Agent of the United
States Department of Agriculture. It bears the imprint of the-
Government Printing Office, Washington, 1894. Mr. Dodge-
remarks on Flax Culture for Fibre :
The beautiful display of American-grown flax and manufactured linen
shown by the Department at the World?s Columbian Exposition gave proof
that the soil and climate of many portions of the United states are
especially adapted to this culture. That the industry has not yet been
established on a self-supporting basis is due to the fact that the conditions
on which it must be established are not thoroughly understood, and that the
obstacles to success have not yet been removed. To reduce it to a propo-
sition, the special needs of the industry are a full knowledge on the part of
our farmers of the practice required to produce good fibre and labour
and machinery to place this practice , agriculturally, on a footing with
other staple crops, in the production of which American farmers use the
best agricultural machinery in the world. There is a third condition ?the
need of scutching mills to take the farmers' straw (flax in the rough)
when grown, and turn it into the hind of fibre that the manufacturers will
purchase ; but this is a question of capital, and when the other conditions
are realised this matter will settle itself.
So much has been written in previous ?Bulletins? of the Office of
Fibre Investigations regarding the proper practice for successful culture
that it is hardly necessary to go over the ground in this report, although
the suggestions will need to be repeated again and again before the necessity
for following the practice outlined is fully appreciated. Seed culture and
fibre culture are so distinctly different that the farmer who essays to grow
fibre by the same methods he employs in growing seed can only make an
ignominious failure, and he will do well to avoia the experiment.
Further on Mr. Dodge states :
The very cheapness of lands in this country and the fertility of the
soil give us a positive advantage over many foreign flax growers at the
very outset; and with the practice of what we have termed an ?American
practice,? the varied operations of which are cheapened by the use of im-
proved labour-saving machinery, there can be no question regarding the
ability of the farmer to produce a crop of straw economically. For the
preparation of the soil, the ordinary implements found on every well-regu-
lated American farm will suffice, and there are none better in the world.
. . . . The fine samples of linen manufactured in the United States
from home-grown flax, and exhibited in the Department?s fibre collection
at the World?s Fair in Chicago, prove that we can manufacture flax. The
largest display was of bleached and unbleached crash in bolts and draped
fabric, manufactured at the Stevens Linen Mills, Webster, Mass., from flax
grown and prepared in Minnesota by Mr. Eugene Bosse. A second display
of fine crash and towels with borders was received from the Sioux Falls


Xiinen Mills, South Dakota, made from flax grown and prepared in that
State.
Mr. Dodge dilates on the possibility of developing an ex-
port trade in flax with foreign countries, and alludes to the
steadily declining home supply in foreign flax growing countries.
He instances Germany, which imported in the year 1892 60,000
tons of ?raw? flax fibre, which was utilised by thirteen large
spinneries. Over 55,000 tons came from Russia, which country
also, he adds, exports largely to England and Belgium.
Germany admits this product free of duty ; ? and owing to the
difference on the question of the tariff between Germany and
Russia, the American Consul-General suggests the possibility
of the flax-seed growers of the United States, who now throw
away immense quantities of the straw, utilising it by taking the
trouble necessary to save and prepare it for export. It is urged
as more than probable that in certain sections of that country,
and at the expense of a little time and trouble, the flax straw
now wasted may be so saved as to compete with the Russian
flax straw in the markets of Germany, England, and Belgium.
It is a mistake to consider that utilisation of the now wasted
straw from fields where flax is grown for seed will supply this
demand. The straw from a field of flax grown for seed is coarse
and woody , and , as a rule, is deficient in fibre.? Mr. Dodge?s
pamphlet bears out very clearly my opinions as to the proper
system of flax culture, and the experimental state of the in-
dustry in the United States. His views on cultivating an
export trade I thoroughly agree with. Mr. Dodges?s articles
on flax and kindred subjects are at all times well worthy of
j)erusal, treating his subject, as he does, from all standpoints.
VICTORIA?S IMPORTS OF ARTICLES PRODUCED
FROM FLAX.
To enumerate the various imported articles produced from
flax is extremely difficult. The colonies do hot clearly enough
distinguish between the respective commodities known as textile
fabrics to render their tables any use to those who consult
them. It may be taken for granted, however, that as the
warmer latitudes are approached the consumption of linen
material will be found to be proportionately higher per head
of population than in Victoria. 1 observed, during a visit to
Queensland in the summer of 1889, that persons of both sexes
in Brisbane and more northern towns used linen dress material
more generally than those in Melbourne do. Queensland
imported nearly five times a greater quantity of manufactured
linen goods than Victoria in 1888;: but possibly in piece goods
Victoria may have exceeded it. The following are Victoria?s

importations for 1892 of commodities derived from flax fibre or
flax seed: ?
It is difficult to state what proportion of cotton goods, or
material manufactured partly from cotton and partly from flax,
may be included in one or two items of the foregoing list; but
it is sufficient to show some of the numerous commodities im-
ported of which the colonies are capable of producing the raw
material. If we followed a rational system of production, got
rid of some of our fiscal burdens, and enjoyed the advantage of
intercolonial freetrade, I see no reason why we should not
attain to considerable dimensions as producers of linseed oil for
local consumption and for export. What we must seek to do is,
to foster those national industries which will not only repay the
workman?s wages, but leave a fair margin of profit for the
capital and ability utilised in conducting them.
THE SEASONS.
Some people, I understand, fear flax will not suit our
climate. The fault is theirs, not the climate?s. By sowing at
the proper time, you can accommodate your crop in warm dis-
tricts to a mild temperature until it ripens. The thing is to sow
early there. I have explained that flax was originally a native
of a warm climate, one much warmer than our own. The common-
sense way to look at it is this?a district has a mild season for
three or four months, utilise that season for its growth. If
growers put their heart into the work, adopt the methods
I have explained, and faithfully carry out details, I entertain
no doubt respecting the success of the flax industry. A flax
breaker and scutcher can be procured for about �7O, and can bo
worked by steam or horse power.


HINTS TO FLAX GROWERS.
1. Study climate, situation, and soil.
2. Sow pure sound seed : bad seed dear at any price.
3. Do not sow in wet weather, or when the soil is in the
slightest degree damp.
4. Light, sandy loams for early sowing, heavier soils for
late. Sow in all cases as early as circumstances will admit.
5. Sow thick for fibre; thin for seed.
6. Plough, harrow, and roll, until a fine seed-bed is obtained.
7. Pull flax in preference to mowing it; but if water for
retting be not obtainable , the seed crop alone will repay the
cultivator, and in that case mowing may be tolerated, as the
fibre afterwards obtainable from the cut crop will suit for
purposes of local manufacture into cordage, twine, etc. Only
in these exceptional circumstances is cutting the crop advised.
8. For fibre commence harvesting when the stalk is in the
mid stage, between the green and the yellow ; or, in other words,
before the seed boll has assumed its slightly brown tinge, indicat-
ing ripeness.
9. Co-operate with surrounding growers, so that with the
minimum expenditure in machinery you may accomplish the
maximum of work in fibre producing. Put in another form : It
is cheaper for a community of growers to support one or more
flax mills in their midst than for each grower to break and scutch
his own crop. This is a proper and economical division of labour.
Do not envy the mill owner. What brings him prosperity brings
you wealth.
10. If the crop be intended for seed, do not harvest it until
the seed bolls are thoroughly ripe.
11. Flax intended for fibre should be steeped with the seed
adhering to it. What is pulled during the day must be in the
dam (ret) before night . #
12. Flax pulled before it is thoroughly ripe, steeped with
the seed adhering to it, and taken out of the dam at a certain
stage, will produce lustrous and fine fibre. There will be little
waste in tow.
13. Beginners advised to not exceed five acres for a first
experiment. .
14. Keep a diary; carefully note therein time of sowing,
steeping, pulling, retting, and drying, state of the weathet during
retting, etc. Practical information of this nature will prove
most valtlable hereafter.
15. Recollect Ulster and Belgian growers pay more attention
to quality than quantity. # . ,
16. Peaty soils good for seed] inferior for fibre. Read
the article on ? Russian Flax.? ,
17. When the sheaves are put in the dam give them a light
covering of straw or rushes. Produces uniformity of colour.

]B. Keep tjie seed pure, and varieties separate. Mixed
samples mean contracted prices.
19. Change 3 T our seed each alternate year; you may not
think there is any good reason for adopting this method, but
do it all the same ! r
20. Bear in mind flax is not a swamp plant, but a lover of
well drained soil. Do not confound it with rice.
21. Watch the steep during the retting process !
22. Stick to primitive methods of breaking and scutching
until circumstances justify you procuring more advanced) ap-
pliances to do that work.
23. Home manufacturers of linen pronounce the old methods
of fibre extraction as not yet superseded by any better ones.
24. Where clean grass land is not available, adopt the
?Scottish plan of drying in the sheaf.
25. Do all work well; leave nothing to chance ; evince a
?desire to be at the ??top of the tree? as a successful grower.
By so doing you, will reap an adequate reward for your labour,
and assist in sustaining the good name of the colony for its pro-
ducts.
26. If you know more about flax culture than your neigh-
bour, give him the benefit of your ideas freely ; if less, accept
his advice if he proffers it. .
27. The key to flax culture?method and skill.
28. Both method and skill are taught in the Australian
Farm and Home.

DAD mmilAA A POWERFUL INSECTICIDE
I Ar"UIUIUIYIj and fungicide.
Guaranteed to destroy Antracnose, Oidium Mildew, Vine Parasites,
Chlorosis, Aphis (larvae), and all Parasitical Insects of
Plants, Vegetable Gardens, Sec.
The marvellous results obtained by its application in France, as well as in
Foreign Countries, have more than accentuated its rapid success, and its
superiority over sulphur and other well-known insecticides has been
acknowledged. It cures Oidium radically, even when sulphur has failed.
Our Par-Oidium should prove a veritable boon to owners of Vineyards
suffering from Parasitical Diseases.
HUNDREDS OF TESTIMONIALS RECEIVED, SOME OF WHICH
WE APPEND?
Messrs. Geo. Burk, Franc art & Co., Melbourne.
Dear Sirs, ?1 have much pleasure in informing you that the experi-
ment made with your Par-Oidium at the Vineyard of the School of
Viticulture, Rutherglen, gave me entire satisfaction.
Alternate rows of vines were dressed with Par-Oidium and sulphur, and
1 may state that at the end of the season there was a marked difference in
favor of the former. 1 consider that its beneficial effect is principally due
to its being so much finer and impalpable as compared with other fine
dressings in use, which is the chief point of any powder to be effective in
combating fungoid disease on plants.
I should like to see the experiment continued for two or three
successive seasons, to ascertain if its use will eventually prevent the re-
appearance of the disease.
Yours faithfully,
ROMEO BRAGATO,
Viticultural Expert to the Government.
sth June, 1895.
Dear Sirs, ?In reply to your letter of the 24th ult., we have used Par-
Oidium largely in the treatment of trees and vines in Mildura orchards and
vineyards with very satisfactory results, and we consider it to be a valuable
and effective fungicide.
Yours faithfully,
CHAFFEY BROS. LIM.,
W. B. Chaffey, Director.
11th May, 1895.
Dear Sirs, ?I have delayed answering your repeated enquiries re the
action of the Par-Oidium until I had thoroughly satisfied myself as to its
efficacy. 1 have now, however, after using it for two years, come to the
conclusion that it is superior to the ordinary sublimated sulphur against
Oidium. It acts more quickly, being greatly composed of sulphur in a much
finer form. It covers and sticks to the vines in a capital manner.
A great inducement in these times of depression is that it goes twice as
far as sulphur, whilst giving better results.
I have recommended your Par-Oidium to many of ray friends, and will
do so to any vigneron whose vines suffer from Oidium.
I certainly will continue using it.
Y?ours faithfully
(Signed) _ A. De BAVAY.

Yering,
February 20th, 1393.
Dear Sirs, ?I have much pleasure in recommending the Par-Oidium,
which has fully answered my expectation. I think it should be applied
early and sparingly, as from my experience with it this season it is more
powerful than sulphur.
Yours truly,
(Signed) PAUL De CASTELLA.
Saint Hilaire Vineyard,
Albury, sth June, 1894.
Dear Sirs, ? Your Par-Oidium gave me great satisfaction last season,
and I intend to use it for all my vineyard in the Spring. Several of my
neighbours will also use it next season.
I remain, dear sirs,
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) L. FRERE.
Tongala Vineyard,
Tongala, Ist March, 1894.
Ddar Sirs, ?I am highly pleased with the results of the Par-Oidium
wherever I have tried it. There are two great advantages gained in using
the same?
Ist. ?The person using it is not liable to contract eye disease ; the
Par-Oidium does not affect the eyesight.
2nd. ?The Par-Oidium being a much finer powder than sulphur
goes a great deal further, as it takes 100 kilos ( = 2211b.) of
sulphur against 60 kilos ( = 1321b.) of Par-Oidium to disinfect
the same quantity of vines.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) FRANCOIS De CASTELLA.
Pine Tree Vineyard,
Rutherglen, 9th October, 1894.
Dear Sirs, ?Kindly forward me three cwt. Par-Oidium and two pairs
of bellows. 1 used it on about one acre of vines last year, and they_ were
the only grapes in the vineyard that did not get eaten with the caterpillars.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) THOMAS W. JBRIERLY.
Aldora Vineyard,
Magill, South Australia, 19th February, 1895.
Dear Sirs,? l have found your Par-Oidium very effective for vines
affected with Oidium, and I intend in the future to do away with sulphur,
and use Par-Oidium instead.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) E. MAZURE,
Manager Auldana Vineyard
