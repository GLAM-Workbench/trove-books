It is a science, the study of a lifetime, in which you may
exhaust yourself', hut never your subject. It is a contest,
a duel, or a melee, calling for courage, skill, strategy and
self-control. It is a test of temper, a trial of honour, a
revealer of character. It affords a chance to play the man
and act the gentleman. It means going into God's out-of-
doors, getting close to nature, fresh air exercise, and sweeping
away of the mental cobwebs, a genuine recreation of the
tired tissues. It is a cure for care, an antidote to worry.
It includes companionship with friends, social intercourse,
opportunities for courtesy, kindliness and generosity to an
opponent. It promotes not only physical health, but moral
force.

Pretace.
The Committee of the Manly Golf Club have long
cherished the idea of the production of a history of the Club,
which would serve as a memorial to its pioneers and as a
reminder to the present generation that the heritage they
now enjoy is the result of much unselfish labour on the
part of those pioneers.
With this objective in view, the Committee were fortunate
in securing the services of Mr. C. H. Bertie, Fellow of
Royal Australian Historical Society, in writing the history,
and we feel sure its production will be appreciated by all
readers. We are indebted to some of the pioneers for much
valuable data among whom we mention Messrs. G. J.
Wilkinson, J. Z. Huie and C. F. W. Lloyd. As members
are aware the first named, our late Patron, has now passed
away, and we feel that we honour ourselves by committing
to this page the minute recorded shortly after the happening
of this sad event.
“ The Committee have placed on record the regrettable
passing of the Club’s Patron, Mr. G. J. Wilkinson, on
the 3rd September, 1945. It universally agreed that
he was an outstanding and picturesque figure in the world
of Golf in this country, and was one of the pioneers in
1903 of the Royal and Ancient Game in the Manly District.
cc At the formation of the Manly Golf Club in 1907, he
was the first Hon. Treasurer, which position he held
until 1910, when he became a Vice-President, an office
he occupied with dignity and skill until 1920, when he
accepted the Presidential Chair, which he held until 1927,
retiring in favour of his life-long friend, Mr. C. F. W.
Lloyd.
cc When Dr. David Thomas died, Mr. Wilkinson was
elected Patron in 1931, which office he held with marked
honour and ability until his death as above. The Club’s


late Patron rendered outstanding service, not only to the
Club, but in the interests of the game as a whole.
His passing leaves us poorer by the loss of a great and
loyal friend and administrator.”
As the manuscript was completed before the passing of
our friend no alterations to the past tense have been deemed
necessary.

President.


CHAPTER ONE.
D. H. Deniehy, in one of his essays, said that Australian
trees are “ a little too much like bronze castings at a dis-
tance.” When we look, too, at our native grasses we find
that the prevailing hue is a nondescript green. As a contrast,
when one lands in England, at Dover, and travels through
Kent, for the first time, one cannot repress the exclamation
“ How green is the country!” There is a lushness unknown
to Australians.
These thoughts arose in my mind, one day, as I sat on
the balcony of the Manly Golf Club, and looked down on
an expanse of grass, almost equal in its lushness to an English
countryside.
Unlike the English scene, however, the greenness I looked
upon was not an effect achieved solely by nature, but resulted
from the work of man and nature.
It was patent that, in its virgin state, the low-lying lands
below me must have been of a marshy character, the abode
of snakes and other slimy things.
Who were the men, and how did they accomplish the
marvel of transforming bogs and marshes into meadow
lands, were the questions that naturally came into my mind.
This book is an attempt to supply answers to these
questions.
It is well that men, taking their ease in a well ordered
club house, with a pleasant prospect of green lawns, trees
and gardens before them, should pause, occasionally, and
remember the pioneers who made these things possible.
As a background to our history a little excursion into
ancient history will not be out of place. If you ask a Scot
where the game of golf originated he will reply, without
hesitation, “ Scotland, of course!” and, probably, will refer
you to the numerous references to the game in the Acts and
Ordinances of the Kings of Scotland, in the sixteenth century.
He may go further and quote such an example as :—“ Item.
It is statute and ordained that in na place of the Realme
there be used fute-ball, golfe, or uther sik unprofitable
sportes, for the common gude of the Realme and defence
thereof.” This quotation comes from an Act of James IV,
King of Scotland, A.D. 1473-1513.


A History of the Manly Golf Club.
King James thought his subjects would be more profitably
employed in learning to shoot with bows and arrows than
in indulging in such “ unprofitable sportes ” as football
and golf.
Despite the firm belief of Scotsmen, however, from the
scanty records available, it appears that golf came to Scotland
from Holland. The earliest known picture of the game is a
Dutch painting, dating from the beginning of the fifteenth
century. The word “ Golf” is probably derived from the
Dutch “ Kolf ” —a club, pronounced like the English
rendering.
While there might be argument as to the origin of the
game there is no doubt it was Scotland which took the game,
fostered and developed it and gave it to the world.
For some four hundred years Scotsmen played the game
before England discovered its charm —and depths of despair.
It was not until the ’eighties of last century that Golf secured
a place in the sporting circles of England. Mr. Bernard
Darwin in his book “ Rubs of the Green ” relates that
golfers in England, in the early ’eighties, stole about their
business almost in a furtive manner, and were subject to
rude or jocular remarks from the onlookers. In the ’nineties
a wave of enthusiasm for the game developed. This grew
in volume, reached America and finally swept around the
world. Today one can say that Golf is the great international
sport.
Golf reached Australia at the period when it was invading
England. Needless to say there are stories of stray en-
thusiasts, earning a reputation for eccentricity by hitting
golf balls in lonely paddocks, before there were any clubs
established. It is related that Mr. John Dunsmore, a
solicitor in Sydney, returned to Scotland on a visit in 1852,
and while at St. Andrews he obtained some of the first
gutty balls made and brought them to Sydney. Mr.
Dunsmore played his game between Homebush and Concord,
in the vicinity of the present Concord links.
The following account of the introduction of organised
golf in Australia is derived from a letter, written by the late
J. W. Fletcher, a member of the first club. About the
winter of 1882 Mr. C. E. Riddell, the Secretary of the Union
Club, Sydney, contemplated the formation of a golf club.
He succeeded in interesting some members of the Club,
and others not connected with it, and a golf club was duly
formed. Links were secured in Moore Park where the


roadway now runs from the Randwick Road into Centennial
Park. Mr. Fletcher writes “ I think that it may fairly be
claimed that Mr. C. E. Riddell was the originator of golf
in Australia. Nothing had been done in Melbourne at
that time, as I remember Mr. Donald Campbell made us
a present of his clubs and told me that there was no chance
of using them in Melbourne.”
In 1883 or’B4 Mr. Cadogan, a visitor from England, pre-
sented the club with a cup, to be played for under certain
conditions. In June, 1884, Mr. Riddell convened a well
attended meeting at the Exchange Hotel and the club was
put on a more regular foundation. About the year 1888
the Centennial Park was laid out, and, in the construction,
the club lost its links. Then Mr. Riddell left for England
and the club, shall we say, went to sleep. In 1895 Mr.
Fletcher undertook the task of resuscitating the club. He
found there was a sum of £4O to the credit of the Australian
Golf Club in the bank, that the Cadogan cup and the clubs,
etc., were in safe hands and that Mr. Yuill had control of
everything. He saw that gentleman and as a result, in
September, 1895, a meeting was held in Mr. Yuill’s office
and the club was brought to life again.
In 1893, during the period of slumber of the Australian
Club, a new club, now the Royal Sydney, was formed.
Mr. Fletcher contended that the Australian Club of 1895
was not a new club but the club of 1882 revived. In support
of his contention he pointed out that the balance of the
funds of the original club was used as the nucleus of the
funds of the revived club, and the Cadogan Cup is still
played for under the original conditions.
Mr. Leonard Dobbin contributed a chapter to D. Soutar’s
book “ Australian Golf,” published in 1906, in which he
relates the formation of the Sydney, now the Royal Sydney
Golf Club. On August 2, 1893, a meeting was held in
the chambers of Mr. Gerald Campbell, at which it was
decided to form the Sydney Golf Club. Twenty members
were elected at the meeting. Mr. Dobbin was elected
honorary secretary. At first the Club played, by the
courtesy of Miss Eadith Walker, in the grounds of her house
“ Yaralla,” at Concord. About June, 1894, a nine-hole
course was started at Bondi North, which, says Mr. Dobbin,
was “ short, but sporting.” He dismisses the claim of the
Australian Golf Club to be the oldest golf club in Australia
with the words “ The Australian Golf Club did not survive


the loss of their links at Centennial Park ” and refers to the
Cadogan Cup as being subsequently “ discovered.”
As to the question of seniority, lacking the wisdom of
Solomon, I refuse to pronounce who was the mother of the
child.
CHAPTER TWO.
Golf in New South Wales was well established before the
name of Manly appears in its annals. The reason is not
hard to find. In the ’nineties of last century Manly was
like a youth emerging into manhood. Its pioneers were
aware of its potentialities. On the plan of the first sub-
division sale of Manly, dated January, 1855, is printed
“ In laying out Ellensville and Montpellier the object has
been to give such a character to these Marine Retreats
that they may become the favourite resorts of the Colonists.
The Promenades and Squares indicated on the plan will
be the means of ensuring health and amusement to residents
and visitors.” Manly however had to wait many years
before it became the “ favourite resort of the Colonists.”
In the ’eighties of last century the voice of the land
auctioneer was heard throughout both New South Wales
and Victoria. A positive mania for land speculation seized
the populace and the auctioneers provided ample oppor-
tunities for the people to indulge in that speculation. Manly
presented an almost virgin field, with the result that many
estates were subdivided and sold in that decade.
I have in my library two brochures, one advertising the
sale of the “ Fairview ” estate, and the other the sale of the
“ Eastbourne ” or “ Cavendish ” estate, of which Addison
Road formed the southern boundary. Both sales were
held in 1885. The auctioneers of the period possessed a
vocabulary, far richer in superlatives than their descendants,
and the charms of Manly were extolled, in these booklets,
in no uncertain tones.
The land boom burst with a loud report early in die
’nineties, bringing down a number of banks in the resulting
financial crisis. As far as Manly was concerned the boom
had one beneficial effect. The breaking up of the large
estates opened the way for settlement, with the result that
numbers of people were encouraged to make their homes

in the village. Amongst this influx was Mr. John Woods,
a prominent Sydney contractor. Mr. Woods bought Fair-
light House, a prominent feature in the landscape of the
’nineties. The house was demolished, some years ago,
to make way for flats, but the house and its owner, are kept
in remembrance in the names of Woods Parade and Fair-
light Street.
We have introduced Mr. Woods so that we can use his
broad back to leapfrog into a most important event in the
sporting history of Manly. Nothing more or less than the
introduction of golf into the community.
While many “ golf widows ” may question whether this
was to be regarded as a blessing or a curse, all good golfers
will agree with me that the event should be starred in the
history of Manly.
Golf did not come to the district with any flourish of
trumpets or parade. On the contrary it can be said that it
crept in, and its promoters would have been astonished had
some prophet told them that, one day, they would be hailed
as pioneers.
Amongst the sons of Mr. John Woods were H. D. L.
and C. E. Woods. One of these young men acquired a
golf club in the year 1901, when, as we have seen, golf was
in its infancy in Australia. The club was a cleek, which
does not appear in the armory of a modern golfer, but was
a powerful weapon in the hands of the old professionals
in Scotland. The two brothers decided that they too would
play golf and to provide variety and good fellowship they
invited two friends, Mr. George J. Wilkinson and
Mr. A. V. Hilliard to join the band.
Happily Mr. Wilkinson is still with us, and, to him, I am
indebted for an account of the doings of Manly’s first golf
club.
A course was not hard to find. In 1901 Fairlight House
was almost surrounded by paddocks, in which cows grazed.
No attempt was made to construct greens. On a modern
golf course variety is introduced on the green by altering
the position of the hole. “We did better,” said Mr. Wilkinson,
“ because we altered the position of the greens every
week. We walked round the paddocks and when we found
a likely looking spot for a green we placed a stick in the
ground and drew a ring round it. Not a miserable little
ring like that possessed by a modern hole, but a generous
one that rewarded one’s effort to putt into it.”


The golfers at first were satisfied with three holes, but
later a few more were added at the back of Fairlight House.
The round wax-match box, universally in use in those days,
with the ends pushed out, made an admirable tee. The
first tee was in front of the house and the hole in what is
now Clifford Avenue. The second hole was at the corner
of Woods Parade and the third fairway led them back to
Fairlight House.
Their only club was the cleek before mentioned but each
player had his ball.
When one plays in a four-ball match today one may see,
occasionally, die players distributed to the four points of the
compass. Nothing like that happened to the happy pioneer
golfers of Manly. The balls might wander north, south,
east and west, but where the one club went the four players
followed. “ You can understand,” added Mr. Wilkinson,
“ that the extensive tour of the course we made during our
usual nine holes was not conducted in silence. Apart
from ribald criticism of each other’s efforts and the occasional
—very occasional —applause of a good shot, we had innumer-
able arguments. Our lack of knowledge of golf, as it should
be played, was more than compensated for by our extensive
knowledge of the rules of the game. Like Sarah Battle,
at Whist, we were all for ‘ the rigours of the game.’ Looking
back over the gap of forty-five years it seems to me that we
got as much fun from our debates as from our attempts to
hit the ball.”
It can be understood that the sight of four men tramping
over the paddocks round Fairlight House, in pursuit of
little while balls, soon tickled the interest of the inhabitants
of Manly.
The question, for which there is no reasonable answer,
“What do they see in the game ? ” was asked on many
occasions. On the other hand an interest in the game was
awakened in the minds of several residents. Within two
years of their debut the pioneers began to look for larger
fields to conquer. Their play had improved and they
agreed that some fresh fields and blood would add variety
to the game. A new site for the course was found in what
was known as Farrell’s Paddock (of its location you shall
read later) and here six holes were installed. Evidently
the original four players were augmented by the addition
of three or four new men. Here the little band carried

on for some months, then it was decided that the time had
arrived to form a proper golf club in Manly.
CHAPTER THREE.
I have before me as I write a little note book, complete
with black varnished cover. It cost one penny when new.
Yet, in the eyes of the members of the Manly Golf Club
this penny book is to be counted as one of its treasures,
for in it is recorded the genesis of their club.
As the result of the conditions set out in the preceding
chapter a meeting was held on Wednesday, May 6,1903.
It is only fit and proper that the little black book should be
allowed to tell its own story of this fateful meeting, so here
it is :
“ GOLF.”
“ A meeting was held in the rooms of W. Hunter Smith
on Wednesday, 6th May, 1903, to form a Golf Club in Manly.
Present: W. Hunter Smith, Keith Smith, S. S. Smith,
H. F. Morris, A. V. Hilliard, R. C. Plomley, G. J. Wilkinson,
H. B. Brewer and H. D. L. Woods.
W. Hunter Smith was elected to the chair.

That each member be entitled to invite a stranger to play
over the links on notifying the Secretary of his intention
so to do.
Carried.

Wilkinson —That the fees for caddies be sixpence (6d.)
for the morning and sixpence (6d.) for the afternoon.
Carried.

—That W. H. Smith, G. J. Wilkinson and H. D. L. Woods
be appointed a handicapping committee for the Club.
Carried.
Course :
Proposed by H. B. Brewer and seconded by K. Smith
That the six holes as at present being used be the links,
the first tee to be that in front of Mrs. Farrell s cottage near
the pound.
Rules :
Proposed by H. B. Brewer and seconded by S. S. Smith—
That every hole be played out (Rule 10). A ball may be
lifted from any place under a penalty of two strokes. A bail
if lifted shall be teed if possible behind the place where it
lay. If it be impossible to tee the ball behind the place
where it lay it shall be teed as near as possible thereto but
not nearer the hole. The penalty for a breach of this rule
shall be disqualification.
Carried.


Out of Bounds:
The following places were declared out of bounds:
Mrs. Farrell’s property —Cottage and yard on right of
No. i teeing ground.
Scrub on left of road of Cemetery tee.
Water :
In case of casual water in a hazard or permanent water
through the greens, a ball may be lifted and dropped behind
the lie under a penalty of one stroke.
Rule 32 :
If a ball be played out of bounds a ball shall be dropped
at the spot from which the stroke was played under penalty
of loss of distance. A ball played out of bounds need not be
found.
Rule 15 :
When a ball has to be dropped the player himself shall
drop it. He shall face the hole and shall stand erect behind
the spot from which the ball was lifted, or, in case of water
at the spot at which it entered, keep that spot in a line between
himself and the hole and drop the ball behind him from his
hand, standing as far behind the hazard as he may please.”
We learn from these minutes that the club was to consist
of twelve members. There were nine present at the first
meeting. At the next meeting held on June 3, Dr. Thomas
and T. Holt were elected members. This makes a total
of eleven members but a study of the minute book fails to
disclose the name of the twelfth. There is no record of any
further elections for several meetings, but on October 15,
1902, three new members, in the persons of L. A. B. Wade,
Dr. Pope and G. C. Hole, are amongst those present. At
a meeting on May 2, 1904, the name of N. Pope appears
as a member.
Evidently the club recognised that the position required
clarifying, for, at the last mentioned meeting the following
resolutions were passed :—“ That the members of the club
consist of 12 Manly residents with the addition of six associate
members and that the latter pay 6d. for every Sunday on
which they play.” “ That the following form the 12 and
associates.
The Twelve. H. Brewer, G. C. Hole, Dr. R. J. Pope,
N. Pope, H. F. Morris, G. J. Wilkinson, L. A. B. Wade,

It was inevitable that this band, devoting themselves
to unorthodox pursuits on Sunday mornings, should be
labelled “ The Twelve Apostles.”
The new club lost no time in organizing club competitions.
On May io, 1903, i.e., four days after the club’s foundation,
a 36 holes stroke competition was held. It is evident from
a resolution, at a meeting held on June 28, 1904, “ that
bogee be reduced to 77 by reducing holes 6 and 12 to 3 and
5, 11 and 17 to 4” that, from the six greens available, a
course of 18 holes had been evolved.
As the first organized golf competition in Manly the
competition of May 10 is worthy of record. Here is the
entry in the minute book.
First handicap played by members of club.
Prizes two clubs presented by G. J. Wilkinson.
May 10, 1903. Thirty-six holes.
The winner was H. D. L. Woods with W. Hunter Smith
second and A. V. Hilliard third.
As is recorded in the minutes of the first meeting the
club’s first links were the six holes, already in use, with
the first tee in front of Mrs. Farrell’s cottage near the pound.
This area was known as Farrell’s paddock; later an adjoin-
ing paddock was added to the course. The area is now
covered with villas and it is difficult to visualise it as open
country. Mr. Wilkinson states that, today, Pacific Parade
and Alexander Street run over the site of the links. There
is a reference in the minutes to the “ Cemetery hole,”


Above-Farrell's Paddock—the first course of the Manly Golfers.
Below—Ross's Cottage, used as a club house.


and to the north the course reached a point opposite the
fifth green of the existing course.
The paddock was unfenced, and, on Saturdays, during
the winter, was in use by the Manly Football Club. Grazing
cows and horses and unauthorised golfers added to the
tribulations of the club members. The latter were dealt
with in an original manner. The offending resident would
receive a very polite letter from the honorary secretary of
the Club, intimating that if he desired to join the club his
name would be added to the waiting list. In April, 1905,
an arrangement was made with the Football club whereby
football was restricted to two Saturdays a month.
For the use of the paddock Mrs. Farrell was paid 5/-
per week.
The first holes in use on Farrell’s paddock were simply
holes dug in the ground ; then jam tins were introduced, and,
finally, in December, 1904, the honorary secretary was
authorised to purchase tins for the six holes.
In the beginning all necessary labour in the construction
and upkeep of greens was performed by the club members,
but a change comes over the scene when Mr. and Mrs. Ross
make their appearance. This couple lived in a cottage
standing near the paddock. The first reference to Ross
appears in the minutes of a meeting held on May 30, 1904,
when the Secretary reported that an arrangement had been
made with Mr. Ross to cut and roll the greens for the sum
of 2/6 per Sunday. In the succeeding years the family
became indispensable to the club and received small wages
and gifts for various services. Even the daughter was not
forgotten, for she was in receipt of 6d. a week for providing
wet sand at the tees. In the end the Ross cottage became
the club house. Mrs. Ross dispensed afternoon tea and a
wall of the cottage became the notice board of the club.
At the end of 1906 Mr. Ross was receiving 10/- a week for
his services. When the first club house was built on the
present course the faithful Ross family acted as caretakers.
In August, 1905, the Honorary Secretary reported that he
had made arrangements with Mr. Fishbourne, the lessee,
for the use of a paddock adjoining Farrell’s, at a rental of
£l/5/- per month, the golfers to have the right of sub-
letting the ground to other sports and collecting the fees.
It would appear from the terms of a resolution passed
at a meeting, held on September 26, 1905, that the club
was contemplating vacating Farrell’s paddock. The resolu-


tion read “ Resolved that the arrangements for the final
meeting of the Manly Golfers on Farrell’s Paddock be
postponed for a month.” The exodus, however, was averted.
On May 4, 1906, it was decided that Mr. A. V. Hilliard
interview Mr. Crammond, the owner of the paddock,
“ to try and get possession of the ground and permission
to put up fences round the greens.” The interview was
successful as Mr. Crammond agreed to give the club a lease
of the paddock for a period of two years, at a nominal rent
not exceeding 5/- a week, with permission to fence the
paddock and greens.
CHAPTER FOUR.
Until the Manly golfers moved from Farrell’s paddock
to their permanent home, they were subjugated to various
tribulations, not ordinarily included in the long list of
inflictions endured by golfers. Manly was growing and
the tide of progress was lapping on the shores of their little
kingdom.
At a committee meeting, held on March io, 1905, it was
decided that the Greens Committee make a new hole in
lieu of the existing No. 1 “ in consequence of latter being
built upon,” which strikes one as being a very adequate
reason for the change. Then we find Mrs. Farrell becoming
annoyed with the players and demanding the removal of the
green near her cottage. Occasionally one reads in the
minutes a declaration such as “ Resolved that the enclosure
of new cottage at corner of Pacific Street be out of bounds ”
marking the rising tide of encroachment on the course.
It must not be assumed, however, that these trials and
tribulations, in the early days, were allowed to dampen the
spirits of the “ Twelve Apostles ” and their associates.
On the contrary even the sedate minute books disclose an
atmosphere of good fellowship, and occasionally a whiff
of conviviality. For instances, at a meeting of the club,
held on October 15, 1903, it was decided that, on every
second Sunday the men’s names be placed in a hat and
opponents drawn for. The meetings of the club were held
in many places—on one occasion on the Manly boat as it
ploughed its way to the city. On special occasions Aarons
Exchange Hotel was the venue, preceded by a dinner.


One may be sure that the announcement, by the honorary
secretary at one of these dinner-meetings, that the club had
a credit balance of n/-, was greeted with adequate applause.
The Steyne Hotel, Manly, in time became the usual meeting
place, varied by committee meetings at the homes of several
of the members.
From a social point of view the great event in the history
of the club, when it was The Manly Golfers, was a golf
match against a team of—footballers ! In 1904, Mr.
Bedell-Sivright brought out from England a team of Rugby
footballers. An invitation was extended to the captain
to send a team of eight golfers to meet a Manly eight. The
invitation was accepted and the day fixed for July 3. It
was decided to entertain the visitors with a lunch on the
course. Drinks were to be provided by members “ likewise
golf balls for the visitors.” Mr. Wilkinson has a clear
recollection of the great day. “ Recognizing the impor-
tance,” he said “of the liquid side of the day’s entertainment
we purchased the largest garbage tin on the market. Mr.
Wall, of the Maitland Brewery, kindly donated an adequate
supply of beer. We dug a large hole in the ground, poured
into the tin the beer, and a sufficiency of ginger beer to make
a nice shandy, and lowered the tin into the hole. A cartload
of ice was then tipped into the hole and the surface soil
replaced.
“ After the game the receptacle was resurrected and how
our guests —and incidentally ourselves—did enjoy its con-
tents. At night Mr. and Mrs. Norman Pope entertained
the teams at dinner.”
The Manly team consisted of Dr. R. J. Pope, N. H. Pope,
E. V. Hoben, H. F. Morris, A. V. Hilliard, W. Hunter Smith,
S. S. Smith, G. J. Wilkinson, with L. A. B. Wade as reserve.
At a committee meeting, held on July 27, the honorary
secretary reported that the match against the footballers
“ ended in a complete triumph for the Manly Golfers.”
It is evident that the English team also enjoyed the day
for there is a record of a second visit. At a committee
meeting, held on August 29, it was unanimously decided
“ in the temporary absence of the Chairman ” (Dr. R. Pope)
that “ letters be sent to Mr. Norman Pope and Dr. Pope
for their many acts of kindness towards the Manly Golfers,
especially on the occasion of the visit of the English foot-
ballers.”


Emboldened by the success of this effort the Manly
Golfers decided to try their hands at larger game, this time
against a team of real golfers. (There is a reference in one
of the minute books to an earlier game against Parramatta
Club, but the reference is very brief “ Manly was beaten.”)
A match was arranged with a team of eight players from the
Royal Sydney Golf Club, led by Mr. Hunter Smith. Manly
won by 38 to 11, an indication that the standard of play at
Manly had appreciably risen, although some allowance must
be made for “ local knowledge,” considering the state of
the links.
Inspired no doubt by this and a subsequent victory over
the Royal Sydney Club the Manly Golfers decided to seek
affiliation with the Australian Golf Union. In this they
were successful and at a meeting held on November 8,1905,
Dr. R. Pope reported that he had received notice from the
Royal Sydney Golf Club that the Manly Golfers had become
a duly recognised golf club under the constitution of the
Australian Golf Union. It was thereupon decided to make
application to become registered under the constitution of
the Suburban and Country Golf Association of New South
Wales and in due time the club became a member of the
Association.
While the golfer of today, looking over the well-kept
greens and fairways of his course, from the vantage point of
a comfortable club house, can contrast his luxurious sur-
roundings with the primitiveness of Farrell’s paddock, there
is one aspect of golf, forty years ago, that fills him with envy.
Imagine golf at two shillings a month, which was in 1905,
increased to two shillings and sixpence, and caddies at
sixpence a round !
The Manly Golfers as has been stated, was limited to
twelve members. This number was subsequently increased
to fourteen, but in addition there was, in the year 1906,
associates and honorary and day members which ensured
a good roll up of players. Competitions were held weekly,
the prizes being donated as a rule by members. Despite
the limitation oif members to fourteen, others were elected,
and, at a meeting held on May 4, 1906, it was declared
“ That all members be elected full members except the
Honorary Members.”
The Manly Golfers were not unmindful of the Ladies.
At a meeting held on April 10, 1905, it was resolved that
ladies be allowed to play on the course on week days, except


on Saturdays, but on that day members were entitled to
invite ladies to play. Apparently no subscription or fee
was asked for this privilege. The ladies who took advantage
of the invitation expressed their gratitude to the club, m
December, 1905, by presenting a club to be played for by
the members. r
In the year 1905 we read in the minute book a reference,
for the first time, to new links for the club. This important
event in the club’s history is dealt with later in a separate
As we now approach, in this history, that eventful days
when the “ twelve apostles,” as a body, departed this life,
to be followed in the twinkling of an eye, by its resurrection
as the Manly Golf Club, it is fit and proper that we record
the men on whom fell the burden of the work as officers
of the first club, known as the Manly Golfers. The first
captain was Mr. W. Hunter Smith, to be followed on May 2,
1904, by Dr. R. J. Pope who held the office for a number of
years. The first and only Honorary Secretary and Treasurer
was Mr. H. D. L. Woods and the first President Dr. David
Thomas The record would be incomplete without a
reference to Mr. G. J. Wilkinson. During the three years
life of the first club Mr. Wilkinson never missed a meeting
of the members, a distinction achieved by none of the others.
The records found in the little minute book testify to his
enthusiasm and activity on behalf of the club. In the new
and existing club Mr. Wilkinson has held the offices of
honorary treasurer, vice-president and president, and, from
the year 1931 to date he has been continuously elected the
patron of the club.
During my search through the annals of the club I came
upon only one mistake in Mr. Wilkinson’s career as a golfer.
The record is in print so that it should be authentic. I
quote from a press cutting of date September 6, 1931.
“ A game of considerable importance, at least to those
engaged in it, was staged at Manly on Sunday, when Mr.
C. F. W. Lloyd, president of the club, and the captain,
Mr. Tom Fitzsimmons, played the patron Mr. George
Wilkinson, and the secretary, Mr. Ben Ferrier, in a four
ball best ball match. After thirteen strenuously fought
holes the game was all square. At this critical stage the
patron produced something contained in a bottle, from his
hip pocket. It proved to be the golf mistake of his life.
The president promptly put his tee shot within two feet


of the pin and, holing in two, established a lead which his
opponents vainly tried to reduce.”
When Mr. Wilkinson retired from the presidency of the
club the members subscribed to provide a handsome shield,
named the G. J. Wilkinson Shield, to be competed for
annually by mixed foursomes. The first names to be
inscribed on it were those of Mrs. Harry Hughes and A. M.
Thorn.
In writing this history the records kept by Mr. Wilkinson
have been invaluable. The writer is greatly indebted to
him, not alone for placing these records at his disposal,
but for dredging many interesting items from his memory.
CHAPTER FIVE.
The last entry in the little minute book is a report of a
meeting held on May 8, 1906. A new, and larger, minute
book opens with the proceedings of the third annual meeting
of the Manly Golfers held at the Steyne Hotel on Friday,
May 11, 1906.
In the preceding chapter a reference is made to the decease
of the “ Twelve Apostles ”as a club. This act of hara-kiri
was performed when the following motion was carried at
the third annual meeting. “It was proposed by H. D. L.
Woods, seconded by E. D. Hoben, that, owing to the large
number of members, and in anticipation of our soon having
new links, that the name of the club be changed from the
Manly Golfers to that of the Manly Golf Club.”
Usually a departure from this life is a melancholy event,
but in this case it was otherwise. The members realised
that they were losing the close companionship, which is only
possible in a small number, but looked forward with pleasure
to exchanging their makeshift course for one where golf
could be played in comfort. Mr. Woods, the honorary
secretary, on the first page of the new minute book, wrote
a short account of the career of the Manly Golfers. It is
not necessary to recapitulate the history here, as it is con-
tained in the previous chapters. We must, however, quote
the secretary’s final words as a fitting valedictory to the Manly
Golfers —“ and owing to the number of men in Manly,”
Mr. Woods wrote, “ wanting to play the game and likewise
owing to the fact that a more suitable name was required,

there died at Manly, after three years existence, on nth May,
1906, that happy band known as the Manly Golfers. R.1.P.”
As a record of the members constituting the Manly Golf
Club at its inception, hereunder is a list of names of those
present and those who sent apologies at the meeting of
May 11.
Present. W. J. German (in the chair). Messrs. H. B.
Brewer; F. Carroll; E. Duret; C. G. Freeman; A. V.
Hilliard; E. G. Hoben; R. McCoy; J. A. Tonks; P. S.
Nott; H. N. Pope ; G. J. Wilkinson ; H. D. L. Woods ;
R. Laidley (a visiting member) and Dr. P. D. Jones.
Apologies from. Dr. D. Thomas (President); Dr. R. J.
Pope (Captain) and Messrs. W. Franks; O. Crossman;
H. F. Morris; J. P. Rae; S. S. Smith and R. Pritchett.
There may have been other members, but this is the only
record available.
The following were elected officers of the new club :
President. Dr. David Thomas.
Captain. Dr. R. J. Pope.
Hon. Secretary. H. D. L. Woods.
Hon. Treasurer. G. J. Wilkinson.
Committee. H. N. Pope; W. H. German; H. B.
Brewer; A. V. Hilliard; S. S. Smith.
At a meeting held on June 27, 1906, it was decided to
prepare A and B honorary members lists, the former to
be permanent residents of Manly, to pay a subscription of
10/6 a quarter and to be eligible to play at any time except
Sunday mornings. The B members paid 5/- per month
or 2/ a week and were not entitled to play on Saturday
afternoons or on Sundays.
At a subsequent meeting the B list was rescinded and a
“Visitor’s List” substituted with a subscription of 2/6
a week, or 7/6 a month, or 15/- a quarter, with the right
to play at any time except Sunday morning
The first resident honorary members elected were
E. Williams; R. J. Collins and A. H. Uther, elected on
August 7, 1906.
At this meeting an account was passed for fencing the
greens and putting wire round Farrell’s paddock. It was
resolved also that owing to buildings being erected on the
first paddock the present first hole in the Pound be aban-
doned.
A vote of £7/7/- to J. E. Tonks, with which to improve
the tees and greens, recalls earlier mention of this gentleman


and an expression of the members’ thanks to him for his
labours in improving the links.
In August, 1906, ladies enter the scene as members of the
club. Their subscription was fixed at £l/1/- per annum
with the right to play on any day, except Saturday, Sunday
and holidays. The ladies lost no time in organizing their
section of the club. In September a letter was received
by the honorary secretary from Mrs. A. V. Hilliard enclosing
the names of sixteen ladies desirous of joining the club.
The ladies had held a meeting and appointed officers con-
sisting of captain—Miss L. Cowley; honorary secretary,
Mrs. A. V. Hilliard; committee, Mesdames E. Duret;
J. Tonks; and H. B. Brewer.
In addition to the above the following ladies were included
in the list: Mesdames G. J. Wilkinson and W. Allerton
and the Misses A. Moore ; D. Moore ; C. Moore ; E. Mait-
land ; B. Smith; —. Duret; N. Ranken; L. Brentnall
and —. Bowden. The ladies were duly elected members
of the club at a meeting held on September 17.
At this period a Visitor’s Book was instituted. The
visitor’s name was to be entered and a fee of 1/- each paid.
Any member offending this rule was liable to a penalty of 2/6.
An echo of the Victorian age is encountered in the minutes
of October, 1906. The honorary secretary read a letter
from the Manly Vigilance Association, in which the Associa-
tion requested the members not to play golf on Sundays,
pointing out the beneficial effect on the players and especially
the caddies. The secretary was instructed to acknowledge
receipt of the letter, and to inform the Association that the
letter had been accepted by the committee of the club in
the spirit in which it was written, and that it would receive
the consideration of the committee. A reply which could
not be improved on in the highest diplomatic circles.
Evidence of the forward march of the club is found in
a resolution to pay Ross 10/- per week for cutting and rolling
the greens twice a week and the purchase of new lawn mower
at a cost of £B. An echo of the good old days comes to us
with the intelligence that the honorary treasurer had pur-
chased 6 dozen “ Captain ” golf balls at a pound a dozen.
These were retailed to the member at i/9d. each.
So far as one can gather the links remained a six hole
course —played three times to make the eighteen. On the
first of December, 1906, however the course was extended
by the addition of two new holes.


Veterans whom the club delighted to honour—Mr. G. J. Wilkinson
(right) and Mr. C. F. W. Lloyd in their pavilion of honour.


The use of the links as a football ground, in winter, came
to an end, in the winter of 1907, when the club gave the
Football Club notice that the links would not be available
to them owing to the large increase in members of the golf
club.
In May, 1907, the privilege of playing on Saturday morn-
ings was extended to the lady members of the club.
A word that has dropped out of a golfer’s vocabulary
is recorded in the minutes, when it was decided to hold a
tournament. The Secretary’s first effort to describe it is
“ Swatzfurst tournament ” but, on reflection, he changed
the name to “ Swatfest.” I have been unable to discover
the principle of the competition.
The first annual meeting of the Manly Golf Club was
held at the Steyne Hotel on Tuesday, June 4, 1907. The
honorary secretary in his annual report stated that the club
membership had increased; the club had come fourth in
the B competition of the Suburban and Country Golf
Association and the club hoped to be on the new links by
November. The honorary treasurer announced that the
balance showed a credit of £66/13/10. The revenue
amounted to £l5O/5/9 and the expenditure to £B3/11/11.
An entry in the minutes reveals that three of the holes
on the links rejoiced in the names of Kosciusko, Spion Kop
and Parramatta.
On June 18, 1907, sanction was given to the lady members
to join the Ladies Golf Union of New South Wales. At the
same meeting amongst the new members admitted to the
club appears the name of C. F. W. Lloyd. Visitors to the
Manly Golf Links occasionally remark on the presence of
a little rotunda, occupying a commanding position of the
course, wherein two elderly gentlemen are to be seen seated.
In reply to the inevitable question the visitor is informed
that these are the club’s octogenarian patriarchs, Mr. G. J.
Wilkinson and Mr. C. F. W. Lloyd. These two men have
served the club faithfully over many years, Mr. Wilkinson
since its inception, and to ensure their comfort, as spectators,
the club has erected this seat of honour.
The finances of the club had improved, by August, 1907,
to such an extent that the honorary treasurer was able to an-
nounce that he had placed the sum of £BO at fixed deposit
in the Savings Bank. In this month Mrs. Hilliard resigned
as honorary secretary of the ladies’ club and Mrs. Duret
was elected to the office.


A letter from one of the members of the club, Mr. Huie,
informs us of a hazard not usually associated with the game.
Mr. Huie’s complaint was that the police had taken his
name for playing across a public road. Evidently the matter
was diplomatically arranged for Mr. Huie was informed
that the police would take no further action. It was decided,
however, to remove the tees (more than one) causing the
offence, to new positions.
The cottage of Mr. and Mrs. Ross served the members of
the club in its early years as a welcome club house, but, like
the chrysalis, there came a time for the club to change its
pupa state and emerge like a butterfly. We hear the first
stirrings of this impulse in the proceedings of a meeting
held on October 31, 1907, when “ a long discussion took
place as to the advisability of erecting a new Pavilion near
Ross’s cottage up to the expense of about £l2O or £130.”
The club, however, found itself in the position of having the
money to erect a club-house, but no land on which to build
it. How this formidable difficulty was overcome you shall
read in a subsequent chapter. On December 2, Dr. Pope
informed the meeting that the new links would be available
for play from Saturday, 7th December, 1907, from which
date he and Mr. Norman Pope cordially invited all members
to play thereon.
CHAPTER SIX.
Having reached the point in our history, when a temporary
nine holes course on the present links was opened for play,
it is appropriate that the story of the acquisition of the links
should be told.
At the outset one is confronted with the delicate task
of praising men still happily amongst the living. Without
such a tribute, however, the story would be incomplete
and lacking an adequate expression of gratitude from both
past and present members of the Manly Golf Club.
The reasons for this gratitude are many, but they can
be summed up in the statement, that, but for the generosity
and unselfish labours of Dr. Roland Pope and his brother
Mr. H. N. Pope, the Manly golf links, as they are today,
would not be in existence.
One does not write that a Manly Golf Club would not be

in existence, for one feels that the enthusiasm displayed by
the Manly Golfers would not have evaporated with the loss
of Farrell’s paddock. A golf course of sorts would have
been found but not the course, which, today, is ranked
amongst the finest in the State.
To arrive at the genesis of the club’s property we must
go back to the early days of New South Wales. Amongst
the pioneers of the State was Dr. D’Arcy Wentworth, who
became one of the leading physicians of his day. Fortun-
ately for his descendants the doctor was possessed by a land
hunger, and with it foresight and a patience that was content
to wait on profit. He was one of the first men to recognise
that some day Manly would become an important part of
the city, and he backed his opinion by acquiring large tracts
of what was then remote and undeveloped lands. In 1810
areas of land, totalling 130 acres, had been granted to two
men named Baker and Cheers. The land stretched from
The Corso to St. Patrick’s College. These grants were
purchased by Wentworth, doubtless for a small considera-
tion. In 1818 Wentworth received a grant himself in the
district. This comprised an area of 380 acres and the main
part of the Manly Golf links are part of this grant. The
Manly properties were bequeathed to his daughter Katherine.
She married, first a Captain Darley and later William T.
Bassett. Doubt having arisen as to the titles, an Act of
Parliament was passed, in 1877, to validate them. In this
way the well known Bassett-Darley estates, which figure
in so many Manly titles, came into existence. In the
’eighties the estates were cut up and sold and amongst the
earliest brought to the hammer was the “ Wentworth ”
Estate, sold by Mills, Pile and Gilchrist on Saturday, May 27,
1882. The sales plan of this estate is reproduced on another
page. This plan is interesting to us for blocks 23 to 30
thereon are now part of the club’s course, and the Club
House is standing on what was block 27. It will be noted
that Addiscombe Road passes through the course, but this
part of the street was not opened. The name of Stuart Road,
bounding the club property on the west, was changed to
Quirk Road in honour of Mr. E. W. Quirk who was Mayor
of Manly from 1901 to 1906 and member for the district
during 1902-4.
The blocks 23-30 were each of five acres. Pencilled on
the plan on various blocks is £l4, which one presumes is the
price per acre it realised. I doubt if it will be any consolation


to those golfers who do not regard the Burnt Bridge Creek,
passing through the links, as a blessing, to learn that there
was a burnt bridge. This bridge spanned the creek in what
is now Condamine Street. On the back of the sales plan
is the intimation “ The bridge is now repaired.”
During the ’eighties and ’nineties other portions of the
land, now forming the links, were cut up and sold. Fortun-
ately settlement on these blocks was negligible. The
financial depression of the ’nineties, previously referred to,
accounted, in part, for this lag, but other factors, such as
inaccessibility and the marshy character of the land, con-
tributed to the result.
The late Sir Joynton Smith, in his reminiscences, relates
that one morning he sat on one of the sandhills of Botany,
and, in place of the sea of sand before him, he saw the Ascot
racing track. Sometime about the year 1905 Dr. Pope
and Mr. Norman Pope must have had a similar vision, but
in the place of a racecourse they saw a golf course. Looking
from Farrell’s paddock to the north and west was a large
expanse of vacant land. To the left, a well-wooded hill
ran down to the Burnt Bridge creek and to the right were
areas of slightly elevated ground. When, however, the eyes
of the beholders travelled along the centre, to the north of the
expanse, their eyes must have been filled with dismay.
This area was low-lying, a few feet above sea level, a land
of marshes and bogs, covered with rank vegetation and occa-
sional patches of evil-looking water. In times of heavy
rainfall the area was flooded and became an extension of the
Manly lagoon. Mr. Wilkinson in one of his anecdotes of
the early days, gives us an admirable description of this
area in its primeval state. “ When the Manly Golfers,”
said Mr. Wilkinson, “ first thought of acquiring the land,
Mr. Walter German and myself tried to walk from what is
now the fairway of the 13th hole to Norman Street. We
found it an impossible task. We hadn’t gone more than
six yards when we gave up the attempt and what a sight we
were when we emerged from the morass. I had lost a leg
of my trousers and was covered with mud, but Walter fared
even worse. He had tripped on a snag, lost his walking
stick, and pitched in a mud pit that covered him to his
armpits. Worse, still, we encountered snakes on the edge
of the mud, which wriggled away through the rushes and
high grass. We learned afterwards that the place was
infested with snakes.”


To Mr. Wilkinson’s testimony we are fortunately able
to add the recollections of Mr. H. Griffiths and Mr. George
Ruckley. During the preparation of this book it was dis-
covered that these two men, who knew, from practical experi-
ence, more than any living men the labour involved in con-
verting a land of bogs into golf links, were still alive. These
two men were employed, in the early days, as groundsmen
and on them fell the burden of actually carrying out the
work. Their recollections therefore have a peculiar value.
What follows comes from their combined reminiscences,
although, to avoid repetition, we will use only Mr. Griffiths’
name.
“ The present fourth fairway,” said Mr. Griffiths, “ was
a big swamp, with rushes between ten and twenty feet high.
There were tree stumps everywhere and many dead and
stinking cattle. On the present second hole, when the
fairway was drained, the level of the land fell about two feet,
leaving stumps of trees that distance above the surface.
We used a ‘ Forest Devil ’ in getting out the stumps, and
found the 4 Devil ’ also very useful in getting our horses
out when they were bogged in the swamp. The stumps
from this fairway, and adjoining parts of the links, were
piled up in two big heaps, more than twenty feet high, about
sixty feet in front of the third tee. The hole was called
the 4 Crown of Thorns,’ for the piles had a fatal fascination
for the players, and many balls were lost there. However
when the stumps were dry we burnt the piles. The tee
for the present sixteenth hole was placed in front of the
present second green, but it had to be moved. The presence
of that green seemed to invite slicing much to the annoyance
of the occupants of the green.”
“ In the early days,” continued Mr. Griffiths, “ the links
were alive with wild life. Flocks of Jack Snipe used to
appear on the links regularly, and about September, plover,
curlews, bronzewing pigeons and quail were abundant.
Wild duck and water-hens also were visitors, while rabbits,
hares and bandicoots found sanctuary there. Snakes, it
goes without saying, were numerous and did not find
sanctuary. The lads of the village were always eager to
get a shot at our visitors but seldom got the opportunity.”
The Pope brothers recognised that the draining and
raising of the level of the low-lying areas, and clothing the
salty ground with suitable grass would require a large
expenditure, both of time and money. Then, if both time


and money were expended on making a golf course there
was no certainty that they would ever be repaid. It speaks
much for the faith of Dr. Pope and his brother in their
fellow members of the Manly Golf Club, and in the future
of Manly, that they decided to try and make their vision
pass from dream to fact.
The first problem that presented itself was that of owner-
ship. Through the cutting up of the estates the desired
lands were now divided amongst a large number of people.
In the end eighty-seven different owners had to be located
and induced to sell their holdings. In one case the owner
had to be traced to a city in America, and, for a time, the
club was in possession of blocks for which no owner could be
found. In the end these were located and the club now
has a clear title to all its lands. Having secured the ground
the new owners found themselves in the unwanted and
unprofitable position of acting as rate collectors for the
Municipal Council of Manly. It was discovered that the
Council, not being able to find the owners of a number of
blocks, had simply allowed the rates to accumulate, to the
tune of several hundreds of pounds, and before a title could
be secured these rates had to be paid.
At a meeting of the old or first club, held on May 4, 1906,
the intention of Dr. and Mr. Norman Pope as to the future
ownership of the course was revealed to the members.
Under the heading of “ New Links ” the minutes of the
meeting read “ In reply to a question as to the intention of
the Proprietors, (Dr. and Mr. Norman Pope), regarding
the conditions under which they proposed that the land
purchased by them should in the future be available for
play by the members of the Manly Golf Club, Dr. R. Pope
stated that the purpose in view was to lease the land to the
club on a basis of 5 % annual rental on the total cost, when
laid out, and that the club should have the right of purchase
within some stipulated term of years, it being hoped that
during such a term the club might become strong enough
to form a company to acquire all rights.”
At the third and last annual meeting of the old club held
on May n, 1906, Mr. Norman Pope, on behalf of his brother
and himself gave a progress report on the new links. Up to
the date of the meeting they had expended a sum of
£45433/8/6 on the purchase of land and labour in building
the course. A few small blocks of land had yet to be ac-
quired to provide for a full 18 hole course.


On the conclusion of the report the Chairman called upon
those present to rise, and, with acclamation, show that the
members appreciated the work, time, money and trouble
that the Doctor and Mr. Norman Pope had given to the
new links, “ and on behalf of the club tendered them our
best thanks.” . „ ,
At the first annual meeting of the new club, the Manly
Golf Club, held on June 4,1907, Mr. Norman Pope informed
the meeting that when the links were completed they would
be 5,615 yards long, a little short of the links at Kensington
and Rose Bay.
It has been considered desirable, at this stage, to complete
the story of the acquisition of the links, instead of dividing
it into the subsequent chapters. In this way the history
of the protracted business can be presented as a whole,
rather than as a serial. . , r .
It is a story of a gallant struggle. With a capital of less
than /100 a small body of men cheerfully faced the task or
finding thousands of pounds to provide Manly with an
adequate golf course. It is a chronicle, too, of men s gener-
°Sßrst of the two brothers Pope, without whom it is probable
there would be no story to write, then of the hundreds of
others who gave in a smaller degree.
As related, Mr. Norman Pope stated, at a meeting ot the
club held on May 11, 1906, that up to that date a sum of
£4433/8/6 had been expended on the new links. Expendi-
ture had commenced in 1905 and for four years, that is
until 1909 when the construction of the course was com-
pleted, Mr. Pope and his brother continued to bear the cost
of acquiring land and working costs. In all they expended
a sum of about £16,500. There are references, in the e irly
years, to a 5 % interest on the outlay, to be paid by the club,
but few references to it having been paid. Later some
attempt was evidentiy made to pay the amount (which was
reduced to 4%), but, in the difficult financial years which
followed on the club assuming responsibility for the upkeep
of the course, from January 1, 1909, payment of the interest
fell into arrears. In the final settlement it is revealed that
the sum of £3,500 was owing for arrears. This sum was
wiped off by the Pope brothers.
The members were invited to play on the new links, on a
temporary nine hole course, beginning on Saturday, Decem-
ber 7,1907. In February, 1908, Mr. Norman Pope informed


the members that in the ordinary course of events a full
18 hole course would be available for play by the following
May. It is a significant indication of the state of the links
that he added “ there would be most probably a wet and
a dry course.” The information was greeted with applause.
On Wednesday, January 27, 1909, a special general
meeting of the club was held at the Steyne Hotel to consider
proposals for the acquisition of the links by the club. After
discussion the following resolution was carried: “ That
the club obtain a legal option for two years, in such
terms as the Messrs. Pope and the Committee may determine,
of purchasing, or otherwise acquiring, the links from the
Messrs. Pope at a price to be the amount expended by them
in the purchase and development of the links, with interest
thereon at 5%, calculated to the day of purchase.” A
Special Finance Committee was elected to formulate and
submit to the members a scheme or schemes for implement-
ing this resolution. At the Annual Meeting, held on
April 2, 1909, the chairman of this special committee,
Mr. W. J. Douglass, gave a resume of the work done by the
committee since its formation. He stated that, as a pre-
liminary to the committee submitting some definite scheme
for acquiring the links, it was essential that the membership
should be increased. On calling for suggestions to attain
this end Mr. G. H. Bosch proposed that every member
should sign an undertaking to introduce one additional
member before the 31st of December, 1909, or forfeit the
sum of £l/1/-. The undertaking was promptiy signed
by all the members present at the meeting.
The minute books of the club for the next seven years
contain a story of forbearance on the part of Dr. Pope and
Mr. H. N. Pope and of a sorely troubled finance committee.
The first option expired and was renewed with a lowering
of the rental to 4% on the capitalised outlay. Then, in
1912, the club faced a deficit and the owners came to the
rescue by purchasing the club’s interest in the Club House
for £590. Again, in 1914, a rebate of £IOO on the rent,
allowed a deficit on the year’s operations to be wiped off.
During this period Dr. and Mr. Norman Pope were asked
to place the club lands under offer, for £20,000, to a syndicate
winch proposed to sell the residential frontages and utilise
the flat as a racecourse. The invitation was declined.
In 1916, however, an outside force came into operation
and precipitated a decision. In July of that year Mr. H. N.


Pope informed the committee that an offer of £IB,OOO had
been received from a land syndicate for the property and
it was advisable that he and Dr. Pope should be relieved of
the ownership. It would be necessary therefore for the
club to exercise its option by the 3 IS * °f the month. A
deposit of 5% of the purchase price then became necessary.
An informal meeting of some of the members was held and
steps taken to form a company to acquire the course on
behalf of the club. Debentures were issued and taken up
by the members to provide the cash deposit. In February,
1919, it is recorded in the minute book “ that the Manly
Golf Club adopts and confirms the purchase of the links
from the vendors Dr. R. J. and H. N. Pope.”
The total capital outlay made by these gentlemen was
£16,500, to which is to be added unpaid interest of £3js°°3
making a total of £20,000. They sold the links to the club
for £15,000. It will be seen from these figures that the
effort to establish golf links in Manly cost Dr. Pope and
Mr. Norman Pope about £5,000, apart from many years
of hard work and personal attention.
These figures will enable club members to appreciate
the reason for, and the significance of, the Founders’ Cups,
which are played for annually. Originally the cups were
named the “ Pope ” cups but on the suggestion of the
brothers this was changed to “ Founders.”
I have written that, at this period, the finance committee
was sorely troubled, but soon after the contract for the sale
of the links was signed the committee received what it
hailed as a “ windfall.” On the south side of the links,
separated by a road from the main area, was a block of land,
containing about six and a quarter acres, which had been
purchased by Dr. and Mr. Pope for £625. It was found
that by an alteration in the lay-out of the course it would be
possible to eliminate this block from the links. This
alteration was carried out and the block was then sub-
divided and sold, with the consent of the mortgagees, realising
over £6,000. Deducting this amount from the purchase
price we find that the club acquired the whole of the property
for a sum, in round figures, of £IO,OOO.
Despite this windfall it can be understood that the task
of the finance committee was still full of difficulties. In
addition to the expense involved in the upkeep of the course,
and the improvement of the club house, money had to be
found for payment of interest on the mortgage.


To an appeal for funds the members responded gallantly.
Nearly all the debenture holders returned their interest
and many of the members went further and presented their
debentures to the club. In addition one reads in the
minutes of generous donations to the cost and furnishing
of the club house and its subsequent enlargement.
When the mortgage on the club lands had been reduced
to the vicinity of £5,000 the club experienced its second
attack of growing pains. A new and commodious club
house was in the air, or rather, on the ground in the shape
of plans, and all that was required was money.
It has been whispered to me (not by Mr. Wilkinson) that
a friendly game of golf was played at Manly one afternoon,
between Sir Denison Miller, the Governor of the Common-
wealth Bank and Mr. G. J. Wilkinson. Now it may be
only a coincidence and Mr. Wilkinson may not have lost
a ball to Sir Denison, but the fact is on record that within
a short time of this match the club found itself in possession
of a loan of £20,000 from the Commonwealth Bank. With
this sum the mortgage was cleared off, the debenture holders
repaid and a new club house erected.
CHAPTER SEVEN.
The last chapter has carried us too far along the chrono-
logical road, so we must retrace our steps and pick up the
story where we left it in chapter five. In October, 1907, the
club, having accumulated a few hundred pounds, decided
to have a club house, but was faced with the problem of
having no land on which to erect it. This difficulty was
overcome by Dr. and Mr. Norman Pope agreeing to the
house being erected on their land, but the building was to
be regarded as the property of the club.
Mr. R. J. Collins acted as honorary architect. The
initial estimate was to expend £2OO on the building, but,
in the end, over twice this amount was spent in building
and furnishing, and the treasurer had to arrange an over-
draft of £IOO. It is perhaps superfluous to add that such
an important event was the occasion for much discussion
and many meetings. When the furnishing of the house
was discussed the committee decided to expend £4O on
“ only the necessary furnishings.” A call to the members

however resulted in £53 being promptly subscribed, and the
club house opened with more comforts than “ only the
necessary fittings.”
To complete the picture, Mr. G. H. Bosch presented a
clock to the club house. The mention of this gentleman’s
name offers an opportunity to introduce a man who is to
be ranked as one of the club’s benefactors. He was a
wealthy man, who, in his lifetime endowed the University
of Sydney with £250,000. His gifts to the Manly Golf
Club were not on this scale, but they were timely and numer-
ous. The club’s appreciation of Mr. Bosch is summed up
in the following resolution which was passed at a meeting
held on September 14, 1909 : “ It was resolved to record
in the minutes the appreciation of the Committee for the
very generous donation by Mr. G. H. Bosch of £6O, con-
tributed towards the cost of additions and alterations to
present club premises, and also for the active interest he
had taken in the matter as a member of the House Committee
and the Building Committee. The Committee recognised
that it is greatly due to his energy, perseverance, persuasive-
ness and liberality that the matter has now reached a practical
form and they are desirous that this fact should be duly
recorded, and tender Mr. Bosch their thanks for very
practical services.” A complete appreciation that gives us
a measure of the man. Mr. C. F. W. Lloyd told me that
Mr. Bosch’s generosity was wide, and extended to little
acts of courtesy. Mr. Lloyd often played in a four-ball
with him and many times, before they started, Mr. Bosch
would remark “ I do like clean balls in a match ” and to
ensure this happy state, he would present his three partners
with a new ball. A box of 100 cigarettes also was in Mr.
Bosch’s bag for the refreshment of the players.
In the subsequent years the club house was altered and
extended until it grew, as may be confirmed by a glance at
the illustration, into quite a presentable house.
When the club house was erected that portion of Balgowlah
Road, fronting the eastern boundary of the club’s property,
was known as the Old Pittwater Road. It was decided
to erect the club house on this frontage and it stood nearly
opposite to the present intersection of Rolfe Street and
Balgowlah Road. The fifth green of the present course
is in the vicinity of the site of the club house.
The second annual meeting of the club was held on April 8,
1908, with the President, Dr. David Thomas, in the chair.


The reports read at the meeting indicate that the club was
quite pleased with itself. In the first place the honorary
treasurer, Mr. G. Wilkinson, reported that the club com-
pleted the year with a credit balance of £27/12/5 and was
warmly congratulated “ for the way he had looked after
the finances of the club.” Then the honorary secretaries
reported that, with the permission of Dr. and Mr. Norman
Pope, the members were now playing over nine holes of
the new course ; a club house had been erected and furnished
throughout by the members ; the club had met with success
in the B Grade competition of the Suburban and Country
Golf Association and that the club hoped to be playing the
full eighteen holes course by May next. The subscription
was fixed at £2/2/- per annum for residents of Manly who
had resided there for the last six months, and varying rates
for other classes. Ladies* subscriptions were fixed at half
the rates for men. Membership figures were seventy men
and twenty women. The anticipation of opening the full
course was realised and on May 10, 1908, the first eighteen
holes course on the present site was opened.
The success of the club in the B grade competition tempted
the club to aspire to higher flights. It was decided to
make application to the Golf Association to be allowed to
enter a team in the A grade. In reply the Association
regretted that the application had been received too late.
A further indication of the club’s advance is recorded
in the minutes of September 24, 1908. At this meeting
it was decided to appoint J. Donald as the club’s profes-
sional, at a salary of £1 per week. Miss Donald was ap-
pointed as caretaker of the club house but resigned a few
months later. Donald was one of the best players amongst
the professionals, in the early days, and the Manly Club is
to be commended for the assistance it gave both to Donald
and to his brother professionals. The club subscribed to
Donald’s expenses during a championship meeting, and,
in May, 1909, the club members gave £25 for a 72 holes
match between Donald and Dan Soutar. The match,
which was won by Soutar, excited great interest in golf
circles. In December of the same year the first of a series
of three four-ball matches, of 36 holes, between Donald and
Clark against East and Popplewell, took place at Manly.
Donald and Clark won, by 8 up and 6, over the 108 holes.
When the Manly club had a course and a club house it
still lacked one item, essential, in the eyes of a majority of


its members, to make the position complete. Apart from
its social aspect, a bar licence means revenue, and the young
club was sorely in need of any addition to its income. In
Manly, however, at this stage, there were very few club
licences and none for sale. The club did, in the end,
acquire a licence, from an unexpected source. It was a
very costly licence, not to the club, but to the original
possessor. Early in the century a young man named Brock
fell heir to a wealthy estate. He was a man of large ideas
and selected Mona Vale as the site of a scheme on a grand
scale. Brock purchased a large area of land at the Vale,
erected a huge mansion and other buildings on it, obtained
a club licence, laid out polo grounds, a golf course, tennis
courts and a bowling green. The wine vaults were stocked
with vintage wines and never lacked appreciative drinkers
while Brock dispensed hospitality. When the British fleet
was in Sydney Harbour, four-in-hands, loaded with officers,
were to be seen leaving the Steyne Hotel, on their way to
enjoy Mr. Brock’s hospitality. The only thing missing
from this pleasant picture was paying guests, and the in-
evitable crash came. Mr. R. H. Wyley, one of the active
members of the Manly Golf Club committee, discovered
that it was possible to get Brock’s club licence transferred
to the Manly club. Application was duly made and on
April 29, 1909, the transfer was made. Mr. Brock may be
remembered in Mona Vale only for “ Brock’s Folly,” but
in Manly Golf Club there is liquid evidence that even folly
has its uses.
In February, 1909, the committee recommended that the
club colours should be royal purple and old gold. These
were subsequently altered to Oxford blue and old gold.
The club professional Donald, having refused to undertake
the control of caddies, it was decided to appoint George
Marshall as Caddy Master, with a fee of 5/- per week for
Saturday afternoons and on Sunday, with 3/- for each public
holiday.
The club had a care for its caddies. In 1909-10 one finds
a number of Caddies’ matches recorded, and in that, of
September 18, 1909, there is the name J. Kirkwood as
filling second place and third in a later match. When
Dan Soutar was the professional at Manly he took young
Kirkwood in as an assistant, and taught him both club
making and golf. One feels sure that Walter Hagen was
regaled with some reminiscences, when the two stars in the


golfing firmament, Kirkwood and Hagen, played an exhibi-
tion match, at Manly, in 1935.
In the Suburban Golf Competitions for 1909-10 the club
entered an A and B and later a C team. Judging from a
printed list of the club’s record for the season, the Manly
Club met with but moderate success. One item in the list,
however, gave them an excuse for self-congratulation. The
Champion of Champions 36 hole stroke competition, played
at Rose Bay, in November, 1909, was won by one of the
club members, Mr. L. R. Oswald-Sealy.
Mr. Sealy was three times champion of Manly and won
the N.S.W. Champion of Champions competition on three
occasions. On Wednesday, June 27, 19455 as this book
was being written, Mr. Sealy collapsed while playing on
the Roseville links and died soon afterwards.
In an old newspaper cutting I found a description of
Mr. Sealy as a golfer, when he was in his prime, which
reveals that he had, as the writer says, “ a style peculiarly
his own.”
“L. R. Oswald-Sealy (Larry) is a weird golfer,” the
extract reads, “ who, however, gets there. The grips on his
clubs are thick as bat handles. He would brain the caddy
who tried to clean his irons. For a putter he has a bit of
gas-pipe flattened on one side. He has an extraordinary
stance.”
In March Charles Bacon was appointed to the position of
caretaker and house steward at a wage of £l/1/- per week,
less a rental of 1/- per week for the “ old stone house.”
Bacon faithfully served the club for a number of years.
The “ old stone house,” referred to above, for some time
was an eyesore to the club members. It was built on a block
of private land jutting on to the course near the present
nth green. The club made overtures to buy the property
but could not find the necessary funds to complete the deal.
Naturally the committee was perturbed when the house
and grounds were offered for sale. A rescuer, however,
appeared, in the person of Mr. Thomas Wall. He bought
the house and transferred it to the club ,under mortgage
for the amount of his outlay, without interest. There
was a street leading to the property and as there now existed
no necessity for its continuance the club approached the
Municipal Council of Manly to have the street closed. This
was agreed to, and, at a formal sale, Mr. Wall bought it
for £26 and presented the land to the club.


Although the club house was only a year old, in 1909,
we find the members thinking of a new club house, which at
least demonstrates, in view of the financial position of the
club at that time, that the members were not lacking in
optimism. At a meeting held on July 6 “ considerable
discussion took place on the matter of a new Club House or
additions to present Club House.” It was decided to
inspect sites on the following Sunday. A week later the
committee decided that “ it would be premature to build
at No. 1 Tee at present.” Attention was then directed to
extending the existing house.
At a meeting held on September 7,1909, the tender of Mr.
Jamieson, in the sum of £159/12/6, was accepted for the
erection of additions to the Club House. It was laid down
by the committee that the capital required for the extensions
should not come from the club’s revenue, but must be
raised by subscriptions or loan. Mr. G. H. Bosch thereupon
intimated that he would subscribe £6O towards the cost.
His example was followed by other members and in the
end nearly the whole cost of the extension was contributed
by the members.
An event, in the year 1909, fortunately gave occasion
for a description of the course, as it was in the beginning.
In May, 1909, the Manly Club promoted an open meeting,
the first golf week promoted by any club in N.S.W. The
meeting was “ a remarkable success, no fewer than 367
entries being received.” In a report of the meeting a writer
in the “ Sydney Morning Herald ” described the course
as follows :
“ The first hole is a short 150 yards, but there are difficulties which
require a very accurate first stroke to avoid trouble. The drive for the
second hole must carry the road and the intervening rough, a distance
of 140 yards from the tee, and there is golf trouble on either side, and
a fairly steep bank guarding the green. To get to the third there is level
country for 390 yards, with a drain in front of the green nestling in
between two stone outcrops. A slight climb of the rocks brings the
player to the fourth tee, a hole of 150 yards. This offers no difficulty
to a clean stroke, but inaccuracy brings trouble, from which it is hard
to escape. The golfers’ pass leads down from the rock. It is a natural
cleft about 2 feet wide. The fifth hole, one of the long ones of the course
(53° yards) carries with it perhaps more trouble than any. It is guarded
by a long sand and water bunker, the avoidance of which leads to a fine
undulating green. There are no difficulties on the way to the sixth,
except the rough adjacent to the tee, but the seventh requires an accurate
drive, heavy trouble arising from a shot off the fairway. The eighth,
known as the peninsula—for it is surrounded by water on three sides —


is a short 90 yards hole. This is considered by those who have played
on the leading courses in the Commonwealth as being the best short
hole in Australia. The ninth requires a good carry for the drive, and
a straight run up the green, and holing out, the journey for home begins.
“ Here players are at the tram terminus, and in the course, as it has
been laid out, they have the option, at present, of starting either at the
tenth or the first hole. There are plenty of difficulties from the tee
shot and the green is heavily bunkered. The course to the eleventh
is over flat country, the green being situated between two creeks. The
twelfth is a short hole of 135 yards, which does not present any difficulties
to a perfect shot. The obstacles on the way to the thirteenth hole are
two creeks, which may catch the first and second shot if badly played.
The fourteenth (610 yards) is the longest hole south of the line. The
tee shot takes the accurate player between the plantations, giving room
for a full second shot, after which a carry of about 160 yards is wanted
to avoid trouble. The way to the fifteenth leads slightly uphill. When
the proper bunker has been made at this hole nothing but a very good
shot will be of advantage. From the sixteenth tee a drop shot of about
135 yards is required to a sloping green, upon which it is not easy to
stay, except with a high ball. This green stands next to the peninsula
in the necessity of exercising the keenest judgment of stroke. The
seventeenth hole is guarded by three bunkers, and it requires an accurate
drive and approach to stay on the green. At the eighteenth a short cut
over the rough is offered to those who are game enough to try it, but the
majority favour making an elbow hole of it. This is the green near the
flame trees, which is met on the road to the first tee.”
After reading this description one can echo the concluding
remark of the reporter. “ Speaking generally the course
may be said to be one for good golfers, where good shots
meet with their reward. Heavy trouble awaits the man
who makes a mistake.”
The bogey for the course was 78 and Mr. O. H. O’Brien,
who won the open scratch competition, established an
amateur record with a round of 78. Dr. R. J. Pope was
fourth with a score of 82.
It will assist members to visualize, at least part of the
original course, to know that several of the original greens
are still in use. Here is a list with original and present
numbers of the greens :

as the “ best short hole in Australia ” was known as the

best short hole in Australia.

“ Peninsula.” It was 99 yards long. The tee was in the
rough to the left of the present 7th tee and the green was
on the high ground on the right hand side of the 7th tee.
A picture of the “ Peninsula ” will be found amongst the
illustrations.
In the annual report for the year ended March, 1910,
the honorary treasurer gave some figures, which, the report
said, were “ startling and show the marvellous advancement
made by the club.” These were the figures :
The turnover to March 31, 1908 was £358.
33 33 33 33 33 * 33 *
33 33 33 33 33 33 jC*3s^2.
The report refers also to the inauguration by the Manly
Club of a very pleasant event which has become an annual
fixture. On the suggestion of Mr. E. Duret, then the
honorary secretary, it was decided to invite the secretaries
of the metropolitan and suburban golf clubs, and the secre-
taries of the golf associations, to be the guests of the club
and to compete for a gold pen, presented by the Manly Club.
Mr. J. Z. Huie joined the club in 1906, now, at the age
of 84, he is to be numbered amongst the survivors of the
Farrell’s paddock players. At Mr. Wilkinson’s request
Mr. Huie has kindly jotted down some reminiscences of
the early days of the club. I have included his story of
“ Brock’s Folly,” in relating the history of the club’s licence,
and it seems an appropriate time to introduce the remainder
of Mr. Huie’s recollections.
Playing in the Critchley Parker Shield on one occasion
Mr. Huie had Mr. Roscoe Collins as an opponent. The
contest was keen and when they reached the 14th, Collins
missed a nine inch putt, which so enraged him that he
walked to the fence and threw his clubs into a ditch in the
adjoining Chinaman’s gardens. When Collins sobered down
he rescued his clubs and the game proceeded. Mr. Huie
won the competition and still has the cup replica he won.
Another happening, reminiscent of Wodehouse’s story
“ Heart of a Goof ” when the club conversation was inter-
rupted by the “ crackling sound made by the local parson
breaking the whole of his bag of tricks over his knee,” is
recalled by Mr. Huie when he relates that Tommy Tomble-
son, an amusing but highly strung gentleman, broke his
putter on his knee after missing a short putt.
I have referred in another chapter to the troubles of
the committee for the beautification of the course. Mr.


Huie adds another vexation encountered by this committee.
“ Vandalism,” he writes, “ was rampant in Manly in those
days. Mark Mitchell and I saw that the honeysuckles in
the plantation at the back of the present 18th tee were dying.
We arranged with the curator of the Botanic Gardens to
provide us with some ornamental trees and shrubs. Mark’s
idea was to plant a towering poplar in the centre of the plot
and surround it with nice flowering shrubs, such as flowering
gums, jacarandas and japonicas. The poplar was to be
a beacon which could be seen from any part of the course.
We spent a Sunday afternoon planting and within a fort-
night the whole of the trees and shrubs had been pulled up
and destroyed by the caddies.”
In the Club House hangs a photograph, presented by
Mr. Huie, of a picnic party of Manly golfers. It was taken
about the year 1909, at the old 9th hole, under the clump
of flame trees. Speaking of flame trees Mr. Huie states that
he and “ Tiny ” Potter were on the committee one year and
were deputed to carry out some arbor improvements.
They planted many of the flame trees seen on the course
today, especially the row on the western boundary of the
course, but not the parent clump at the ninth hole.
Before leaving the year 1909 I am reminded by a cutting,
from a Sydney newspaper, of date May 8,1909, of some lines
entitled “ The Earnest Golfer’s Prayer ” which Dr. and
Mr. H. N. Pope had printed on the back of the original
scoring cards of the club.
As the prayer might well be breathed occasionally by
modern golfers it is worth reprinting :
From the many lies upon the links,
St. Andrew guard me still,
From the lie in sand and the cuppy lie,
And the lie on the steep side hill.
From the lie in grass and the stymied lie,
And the lie of the golfing lore;
But of all bad lies I pray thee grace
From the lie about the score.
CHAPTER EIGHT.
In the year 1910 there is little to chronicle beyond a
steady growth in the membership of the club and an all-

round improvement in the standard of golf. At the begin-
ning of the year there was a total of 283 members, and, at
the end, this total had risen to 366. Evidence that the
standard of play had improved is furnished by the fact that
during the year new records for the course were established
in the amateur, professionals and ladies’ divisions. Mr.
L. R. Oswald-Sealy, with a round of 77, made a new amateur
record; Donald, the club’s professional, in a two days’
professional competition for a purse of £2O, established
a record of 72 and the ladies’ record was improved by Miss
Duret with a round of 84.
During the year the handicapping of the members was
entrusted to a single handicapper, in the person of Mr. A. H.
Uther, and the committee takes occasion to comment that
the change “ has proved a very great success,” and conveys
the thanks of the members to Mr. Uther “ for the very able
manner in which he has dealt with this always difficult
matter.”
An unique event took place in June of this year. A
“ Wedding Bells ” mixed foursome was played, with 70
entries, for a trophy presented by Mr. R. F. Wyly. The
foursome was held in honour of the first wedding in the
club and the entrance fees, in the form of a cheque, were
handed to the bride, for the purpose of purchasing a wedding
gift. The bride was Miss Cecil Moore and the bridegroom
Mr. G. M. Lloyd.
In 1911 the Manly Summer Cup and Manly Summer
Handicap were inaugurated. These open events drew a
large and representative entry of 128 players. Mr. C. A.
Jaques donated the first cup, a handsome specimen of the
silversmith’s art.
In the report for the 1911 season the name of a member
is mentioned who has done more than any other man to
raise the standard of golf in the Manly Club. This was
raised to such a degree that on two occasions the club in the
inter-club competitions has won triple premiership honours
in the State. “ The Club,” the report reads “ may be
justly proud of numbering amongst its members a golfer like
Mr. E. L. Apperly.” Then follows Mr. Apperly’s record
for the year which includes two amateur record rounds,
a 77 at Concord and a 75 at Manly. During his many years
connection with Australian golf Mr. Apperly has estab-
lished, in addition to his record as a fine golfer, a reputation
as a sportsman, in the full meaning of the word.


During the year several changes took place in the staff
of the club. Mr. Duret, who had acted for three years as
honorary secretary, was appointed a salaried officer, as
secretary and treasurer. Bacon, the house steward, and
caretaker resigned and was succeeded by John Wood.
Donald, the professional, resigned also and D. G. Soutar
was appointed in his place.
The club was fortunate in securing the services of Soutar,
one of the leading players of his day and one of the finest
teachers of golf.
While the men had occasion to pay tribute to Apperly,
the ladies’ club also had a champion to honour, in the person
of Miss Duret. Her record included runner-up for the
Australian championship, and winner, with O. H. O’Brien,
of the championship mixed foursomes of N.S.W.
In the following year, 1912, the Manly Club had the rare
distinction of possessing two State champions. Apperly
won the amateur championship of the State and Miss Duret
secured the Ladies’ championship.
The Club’s prestige was added to also by D. Soutar, who
was runner up in the Australian Open championship held
in Melbourne.
During 1912 the annual subscription to the club was
raised to £5/5/- for ordinary male members. An entrance
fee of £5/5/-, to operate from July 1, 1913, was imposed
on new members. Lady members’ fees were fixed at
£2/12/6 per annum and an entrance fee of not less than
£l/1/- for new members.
Up to the year 1913 the Manly Club’s performances in
the inter-club competitions, organised by the Suburban and
Country Golf Association, can be classed only as fair but,
the year 1913 was a year of triumph, for the club won all
three of the grade competitions. For historical purposes
here is the club’s record up to that year :
1906. B. team occupied 4th place.
1907. B team —6th place.
1908. B team tied for 2nd position.
1909. Teams entered for A and B grades —each won 2
and lost 4 matches.
1910. A, B and C teams entered. The A’s lost 3 and
won 3 ; the B’s lost 2 and won 4; the C’s lost
2 and won 3.


1911. A and B teams entered. The A’s lost 4 and won
2 matches, the B’s lost 1 and won 5, tieing with
Killara and Bonnie Doon, but lost in play off.
1912. A, B and C teams entered. The Metropolitan
clubs entered these matches for the first time,
competing in the A grade. Manly lost 2 and won
3 matches, being beaten by the two Metropolitan
teams. The B team lost 1 and won 4, tieing with
Dobroyde. Manly again lost in the play off.
The C team won all their matches and the premier-
ship. This was Manly’s first success.
1913. A, B, C teams entered and won all grades. The
Metropolitan clubs did not compete.
Each grade played 6 matches and Manly lost only one
match out of the 18.
It is fitting that the names of the players in these historic
matches of 1913 should be recorded. The A grade team
comprised the following: E. L. Apperly, J. B. Ferrier,
L. R. Oswald-Sealy, P. F. S. Spence, T. Tombleson,
D. G. Ferrier, O. H. Wines, C. C. Ross, G. S. Freeman,
W. R. Opie, H. G. V. Adler and L. A. Dimant.
The B team consisted of: L. J. Osborne, J. R. D. Scott,
A. Deery, J. V. Strong, L. M. Triggs, E. Scott Scott, F. W. A.
Eagar, J. E. Tonks, H. S. Targett, Keith Smith, S. F. Bonamy
and P. Cureton.
The C team players were: Keith Smith, S. F. Bonamy,
F. L. Carroll, J. P. Hill, A. G. Symington, Dr. C. N. Smith,
L. Henderson, R. C. King, R. Sayers, C. H. Kloster, A.
Moore, R. Upward, W. D. Yonge, A. Robey and H. Hepner.
To fittingly celebrate the performance of the teams a
dinner was held at the Hotel Pacific, at which eighty members
of the club were present. Dr. Thomas was in the chair
and the toast of “ The Teams ” was proposed by the Vice-
Presidents, Messrs. G. J. Wilkinson and W. J. Douglass.
On behalf of the teams Messrs. Oswald-Sealy, J. Tonks
and A. G. Symington responded.
In the year 1913 the name of J. B. Ferrier appears for
the first time in the printed annals of the club. It is quite
an impressive entry. In addition to playing No. 2 with
the A team, Mr. Ferrier won the club championship and
the Critchley Parker Shield. In the A team fist will be
found also another Ferrier. Mr. D. G. Ferrier joined the
club in 1909 and his name appears frequently as a competition


winner. In 1914 the final for the club championship was
played between the two namesakes, J. B. being the winner.
During the year 1913 the course was severely tested by
the weather. Four months of rain and four months of
drought in one year placed a heavy burden on the ground
staff, but it was a testimony, both to the staff and the im-
proved condition of the links, that the course was maintained
in a high state of efficiency.
The club lost one of its keenest workers, in the person
of Mr. R. G. Wyley, in this year. He was treasurer of the
club for a number of years and as a member of the house
committee was vigilant in the management of this department
of the club’s activities. Mr. Wyley resigned these offices
on being appointed secretary of the Sydney Cricket Ground.
In November, 1913, the ladies of the club presented a
silver jewel casket to Miss Jenkins, in recognition of her
many years of useful and unselfish work in the interests of
the Manly Club.
With 1914 came the first World War. Naturally the
club felt the impact. Membership fell from a total of 520
in 1913 to 465 at the end of 1914. The attendances of
visitors, however, increased, the Visitor’s Book containing
over 1,100 entries during the year.
On the Autumn Medal Day a pleasant ceremony took
place. It will be remembered that, in 1913, the club’s
three teams won premiership honours. The members of
the teams decided to amalgamate their trophies and pur-
chased a clock for presentation to the club. On April 18,
in the presence of a large number of visitors and members,
the President unveiled the clock.
In the Inter-club matches the B and C grade teams won
all their matches and therefore the competitions.
At the end of the financial year the club faced a deficit,
but again Dr. R. and Mr. H. N. Pope came to the rescue and
rebated the sum of one hundred pounds on rent due. The
accounts then showed a credit balance of £ls/16/3.
Apart from the possession of eighteen bogeys on the
course the club possessed, for a number of years, another
bogey, not included in the ordinary hazards of a golf course.
This bogey took the shape of flood waters. The low-lying
areas of the course had for neighbour a lagoon. A scheme
for the control of drainage of these areas had been put into
operation, to the cost of which the club was expected to
contribute, but the scheme had failed in its purpose. The

result is summed up in the following extract from the report
on the year 1914. “ During the past year and more than
any previous year, the staff have had to contend against
flood waters, owing to the inefficiency of the Curl Curl
Drainage Scheme. It is on record that on eleven occasions
the whole or portion of the staff have had to devote hours
of the hardest toil in clearing out the pipes that control the
oudet, that had become choked with sand to a distance of
20 or 30 feet.”
The flood waters remained a problem for some years and in
1916 involved the club in a law suit. The drainage scheme,
mentioned above, had been instituted by the Public Works
Department. It provided for drainage, by means of pipes,
from the Curl Curl lagoon to the sea. The cost was to be
met by rates on the betterment principle, i.e. payment in
proportion to the benefits received. The Golf Club was
assessed at £B4 per annum, but, in view of the fact that no
benefit had been derived, the club for four years refused
to pay the rate. Other ratepayers had adopted the same
course. In order to bring the matter to a head an appeal
court was held, with a magistrate presiding. The onus of
proof of “ no benefit ” fell principally on the club and expert
assistance was engaged. The magistrate upheld the appeal
of the ratepayers, and accumulated arrears of about £340
were extinguished, as well as the annual levy for the next
twenty-three years.
In later years the flood menace was overcome by other
means.
During the war years the entrance fees for the principal
competitions were donated to the various war funds.
The lady members of the club also supported the competi-
tions, organised by the L.G.U., in aid of war funds. The
ladies championship of the club was won in 1915 by Miss
Duret for the seventh year in succession.
In 1916, as recorded in Chapter Six, the purchase of the
links by the club from Dr. R. Pope and Mr. H. N. Pope
was carried to a conclusion, thanks to the generous terms of
the vendors and a prompt response from the members for
financial assistance.
The year 1917, as the annual report comments, “ marked
an epoch in the annals of the club.” On June 21, 1917, the
Manly Golf Club, founded in 1906, was merged into a
registered company (under guarantee) licensed to hold lands.
This act necessitated various changes in the organisation


of the club. The office bearers and committee, elected in
the beginning of the year, went out of office with the demise
of the old club, and on August 27 an election for these
offices was held under the new constitution. On October 2
the transfer of the assets and liabilities was formally made.
A tribute of gratitude is paid in the annual report to Sir
Allen Taylor and Messrs. Mark Mitchell, W. J. Douglass
and C. W. Schrader “ whose efforts and work have resulted
S °On P J P ime 5, 1917, Mr. H. D. L. Woods died. One of the
four pioneers of golf in Manly, Mr. Woods became the first
Secretary of the Manly Golfers, which in 1906, became the
Manly Golf Club. A
During the year 1918 the membership of the club increased
by thirty-seven. Seventy-four of the members were listed
as serving in active military or other war service abroad.
A number of the members had made the supreme sacrifice.
Early in the year a fund was established to defray the
cost of improvement to the finks. The response to an
appeal for donations was so generous that a sum of £360
was collected. This permitted the committee to employ
extra labour, resulting in a greatly improved course. No
championships or open events were played during me year.
With the war finished, in 1918, inter-club matches were
resumed the next year. At the request of the Golf Associa-
tion the club was asked to enter two teams in the A grade.
The B and C teams won the competitions in their grades.
To meet the increased cost of operating the club the
annual subscription was raised to £6/6/- in 1919.
The question of a new club house was again debated but
it was decided that “ the time was not yet ripe to proceed
with a new club house.” The retirement from office of
Mr. A. H. Uther was announced in the annual report tor
the year. The committee recorded that Mr. Uther had
been on the committee of the Manly Golf Club since 19°7-
He was sole handicapper from 1909 to 1918 and a Vice-
President of the club since its formation into a company.
“ His legal training,” the record concludes, “ sound common
sense and absolute impartiality have at all times been of the
greatest assistance to the committee in their deliberations,
and the loss of his services will be greatly felt and hard to
replace.” Another retirement, also greatly regretted, was
that of Mr. W. J. Douglass. In summing up his services
to the club the committee wrote. “ Few of the old com


mittee remain, but those few know and realise how much
of the success was due to his efforts, how greatly the club
is indebted to him and how regrettable the incidence of his
withdrawal.”
A third departure was that of Mr. J. B. Ferrier, who
returned to Shanghai. “He had done,” said the committee
“ yeoman work as honorary treasurer and as a golfer.”
The members of the A team dined Mr. Ferrier and made him
a small presentation as a souvenir.
On February 26, 1921, Mr. Norman Pope, unveiled the
club’s honour roll. The names of seventy-five members
were inscribed on the roll. Amongst these was that of
Lieutenant H. Hepner, who fell at Salonica. In memory
of the many happy days the Lieutenant spent on the Manly
golf finks Mrs. Hepner expressed a wish to endow the club
with a trophy, in the shape of a handsome cup, to be played
for annually, and known as the Salonica Cup.
In presenting its report for the year 1920 the committee
said it felt justified “ in claiming that at no period of the
club’s history had the prospects been so bright, or the
position more secure.” The year ended with 506 members,
an increase of 69 on the previous year. In the inter-club
matches Manly won the B grade, for the fourth successive
year, and the C grade became premiers of their class for
the fifth successive time.
In 1919 Mr. Thomas Hughes had donated a cup to be
known as the “ Founder’s Cup,” in order to perpetuate the
names of the founders of the finks. The cup bears the
inscription:—
The Founders’ Cup
Donated by Thomas Hughes,
in appreciation of
the great work accomplished
for the game of Golf in Manly
by
Roland Pope and Norman Pope
the
Founders of the Manly Golf Links.
The captain of the club, Dr. David Thomas, announced
his intention to present the lady members of the club with
a cup, with the same object.
In 1920 the first matches for these trophies were held.
The competitions are open to past and present members of
the club, the winners receiving replicas of the cup. Mr.


H. R. Waring and Miss Gregson had the pleasure of seeing
their names inscribed on the plinths of the cups as the
first winners.
The championship of the club was won, in 1920, by Mr.
W. C. Sturrock, who also brought back to the Manly club
house the prized trophy from the Champion of Champions
competition.
At the conclusion of the open championship meeting the
professional golfers were entertained by the club with a
36 hole stroke handicap. J. H. Kirkwood won the event
with rounds of 73 and 68. The afternoon round of 68
established a professional record for the course.
Mr. Bosch was honorary treasurer of the club during the
year under review, and at the conclusion of the first half-
year he warned the members that a heavy deficit in the ac-
counts was looming. A subscription list was opened but
the total result of £277 was not up to the committee’s
expectation, and it was decided to increase the subscription.
An unexpected source of income also presented itself in
the shape of an offer by an aircraft company to pay a rental
of £350 per annum for a lease of portion of the course, not
in use. This offer was accepted and the club finished the
year with a credit of £7/13/2.
By drawing upon various funds the club contrived .to
pay a sum of £1,500 off the mortgage of £IO,OOO. With
a view to further reduction of the mortgage the members
authorised the sale of the block of land, on which the 10th
hole stood, alluded to in a previous chapter.
The Ladies Club championship match of 1920 deserves
mention in these annals. Mrs. Triglone, who as Miss Duret
had secured and held the title on nine successive occasions,
met Mrs. Barton (the State champion) in the final. At the
13th Mrs. Barton was 4up and sto play. Mrs. Triglone
then took the next four holes, halved the 18th and 19th
and won on the 20th green.
Up to the year 1939 when the last match was played
Mrs. Triglone had won the championship on twenty-two
occasions.
From a player’s point of view the most important event
in 1921 was another triple win in the inter-club matches.
It will be remembered that in 1913 Manly won in all three
grades. In 1921, as in 1913, the teams lost only one match
in the series.

During 1921 D. G. Soutar resigned his position of pro-
fessional and he was succeeded by A. B. Chitty who proved
himself a lovable man and a good teacher of the game.
He died on July 29, 1940. Frank Powell, a nephew of
Chitty’s, acted as professional until R. (Dick) Carr was
appointed to the position on September 29, 194 0,
CHAPTER NINE.
In perusing the records of the club one comes to the
conclusion, that, amongst the various committees operating
the club, none was called upon to work harder than the
Greens Committee. Owing to the low-lying character
of the major part of the course, with its constant threat of
floods, the full area available for play could only be brought
gradually into play. The main problem was drainage, and,
when this was achieved, the problem of inducing suitable
grasses to grow on the reclaimed areas had to be faced.
During the years when Dr. R. and Mr. H. N. Pope owned
the lands, and expended thousands of pounds on its improve-
ment, Dr. Pope, as the result of considerable research,
eradicated the coarse natural grass from large areas and
introduced grasses more suitable for golf. When the club
took over the course the various green committees continued
the work, and, we are told that, during Dr. D. Thomas’
active years on this committee, he visited the links almost
daily, to watch the progress of the work.
In commenting on this aspect of the year’s operations
in 1921 the committee reported that a member had gener-
ously made a gift of 150 feet of 12 inch drain pipes. It was
proposed to make alterations in the course which would
enable the play to cover the ground not in use and do away
with driving over roads. Through the kindness of Mr.
A. T. Keirle sand filling had been supplied at a certain
point which decreased some thirty feet of the lagoon, on
the approach to a short hole, to something like four foot,
and at the same time make an excellent sand bunker.
Mr. Keirle again came to the rescue of the club in 1923.
It is stated in the report for that year that “ To Mr. A. T.
Keirle the club is greatly indebted for his most generous
action in supplying, free of cost, vast quantities of sand by
his pumping plant on the Lagoon, a gift that cannot be too


highly appreciated.” This timely gift enabled the com-
mittee to raise the level of the course* adjoining the lagoon,
by several feet, thereby minimising the flood menace.
The success of this experiment was so apparent that the
committee decided to continue the work as funds were
available. For the purpose Mr. Keirle very generously
lent his dredge. In the next few years the course was
transformed. The present 7th and 9th fairways and the
sth green were raised and three acres, known as the island,
were reclaimed, by pumping in 15,000 yards of sand. These
areas had previously been cut off from the course proper by
a waterway or a swamp, and, by filling these in, the present
Bth hole was brought into existence.
The mention of Mr. Keirle’s name recalls that, it is
probable, if Dr. and Mr. Norman Pope had not intervened,
the Manly Golf Club would be playing today on what is
now Keirles’ Park. In the year 1905, when the infant
club made its first gesture towards acquiring lands of its
own, it is recorded, in the little minute book, that at a
meeting held on September 26, 1905, it was resolved “ That
Mr. Nott, Surveyor, be authorised by the Hon. Sec. to
ascertain the owners of lands contiguous to Keirle’s paddock
over the lagoon, to get a rough plan of same, and get same
under firm offer for a period of one to three months, at a
fee of £5/5/-, and also that Keirle’s offer of his 10 acre
paddock, at £6O per acre, be legally bound.”
At least three golf clubs in Sydney have had fires. The
club houses at the Royal Sydney, Australian and Killara
courses in various years, have all been destroyed by fire.
In one fell stroke all argument as to the necessity or desira-
bility of erecting new club houses was resolved and the
clubs set about erecting up-to-date and handsome premises.
Without the assistance of a fire, at Manly, we find “ much
argument and about ” a new club house. The question
was discussed at intervals for several years. Naturally
the main obstacle to be overcome was lack of money. In
1923 however this obstacle was removed. As has been
related a loan of £20,000 was obtained from the Common-
wealth Bank and with this all outstanding liabilities were
cleared off and money provided for a new club house.
Then arose the question of a site—a question very fiercely
debated. There were two rival sites; one in the vicinity
of the old house and the other where the club house now
stands. The first had the disadvantage of being on the


low-lying portion of the course, but was much closer to the
tram service than the second site. Mr. J. A. Wilson,
Manly’s oldest playing member, at the age of 78, tells me
that a gum tree played a decisive part in the selection.
On an inspection of the rival sites, one day, he noticed a
tree growing where the balcony of the club house now stands.
He climbed the tree and when he saw the view from this
vantage point, like John Batman looking for a site of a
village on the banks of the Yarra, he said “ This is the spot.”
“ Opinion was very evenly divided on the merits of the two
sites,” said Mr. Wilson, “ but one by one I got a number of
the members to climb the tree and whatever their opinion
when they went up, they came down as converts.” So the
site was selected and no one, today, doubts the wisdom of
the selection.
The architect members of the club were invited to submit
designs and that of Messrs. Wright and Apperly was chosen.
Tenders were then called for the erection of the club house
and a contract was let to Messrs. E. & W. Tofield, in the
sum of £11,207. Work was commenced in 1923.
As the club house approached completion the committee
decided to invite the members to take up £5 debentures,
to defray the cost of furnishings and fittings. A sum of
£1,545 was realised. In the report for the year 1924 the
committee took the opportunity to thank Messrs. Wright
and Apperly who had designed and called for tenders, for
the new house, and negotiated with the firms who had
supplied the furnishings. “ This service,” the report adds,
“ was rendered gratuitously and voluntarily.”
The new club house was opened on November 1, 19 2 4-
One would imagine that such an important event in the
club’s history would be chronicled in detail in the year’s
report, but the event is dismissed in a few lines. “ The
opening ” the report reads u of the new Club House was
celebrated by a Supper Dance on November 8, and was
a very great success; there were some 350 present. The
rooms were beautifully decorated and illuminated and the
dancing floor was perfect.” For a report of the day’s
happenings therefore we have had to depend on other
sources.
Mr. G. J. Wilkinson, the President of the club, performed
the opening ceremony. The speakers included Dr. David
Thomas, Alderman Samuels (Mayor of Manly), Mr. W.
Scott Fell, M.L.A., and representatives of the metropolitan


golf clubs. Although the weather was unfavourable there
was a large attendance of golfers and well-wishers of the
club. As a token of the occasion a gold key was presented
to Mr. Wilkinson and a framed portrait of himself to Dr.
Thomas.
During the day an open mixed foursome was played.
There were 412 entries. The winners were Miss Hutton
and A. Leone with a fine card of 7 up.
In writing the history of a golf club, one finds difficulty
in relieving the somewhat prosaic material with which one
has to deal. When an opportunity therefore presents itself,
of introducing a little colour into the narrative, it is promptly
seized. Here then are the impressions of a vivacious young
lady of that watery Saturday when the Manly Club House
was opened.
The article appeared in the Evening News of November 3,
1924.
“ Manly’s new golf mansion opened its eyes on Saturday. A fine
infant, after the Italian villa style. Architecturally perfect, spacious,
sumptuous, and a symphony in tones of white and green, with roseate
tiles. Time will mellow and adjust it to its verdant setting.
“ Manly’s old watchdog, the grey north-easter, woke from his lair
in the Pacific. Leaping through the pine trees, he rushed valiantly
into the teeth of the south. He did his best to beat back the damp
invader, but in vain. By noon the rain was falling steadily; nasty,
inquisitive rain that poked clammy fingers down one’s neck and fingered
one’s spine; that soaked and slobbered and sobbed upon us. If the
sun had shone, never would there have been such a bourgeoning of
wonderful sports clothes. I speak the truth, for I had surreptitious
looks and whispers concerning parcels that came like homing doves
from the houses of temptation. While the rain held off, looking down
from the balcony, the finks resembled a rainbow of prismatic hues,
flowing like a colorful river up and down dale. The Temple of Baal
had been ransacked for clamorous effects. The little hats, so debonnaire
before the rain quenched their ardor somewhat, and the shingle curl,
that lies like a scimitar on the cheek; they were all there. And the
apache handkerchief; also the little nose wipe to match your legs.
“ Hear ye the litany of the stocking. There were rose ones and gold
ones, and orange and sunburnt, and purple and green, that made the
clover envious—luscious flesh-coloured ones, and checked and striped.
They adorned fat and thin legs, perfect and bandy ones, beefty, spindle,
clumsy, and divine. They all twinkled and pranced and bravely strode
forth to do or die in wet grass and mud. Petticoats being relegated to
the ark, the wind and rain played havoc with the feminine silhouette.
The men blossomed also, their plus fours floated sturdily, and their
cardigans blazoned forth in a pageantry all their own. Their socks —
O la! la ! Tulips at their best would droop in shame at their yearning
and abandonment.

“ Like mushrooms in the night the umbrellas sprang up, and like
champagne corks afloat they bobbed over the fast soddening greens.
“ j felt sorry for the old club house, silent on the flat, with its clock
hands pointing to a vanished hour. Poor old Cinderella, the echoes
of laughter and memories of halcyon days haunt her verandahs. She
seems to listen for the footsteps that will never return, and wonder at
the fickleness of man. In the new club house, the beauty of the
architecture, the graciousness of its fittings, its harmony and tone, were
embellished by a vision of pretty women and gallant men. A surfeit
of charming girls filled the eye. If the rain had damped their finery,
it had also whipped colour to their cheeks and sparkle to their eyes.
Perhaps never again will such a gathering grace the links.
“ Truly they resembled a living garden, burgeoning.
Caro.
“ Caro ” was so taken with the stocking display that she
forgot to mention that there was also some golf.
In 1924 the Manly Golfers A.I.F. Cup was presented to
the club by the A.I.F. and B.E.F. members. It was to be
played for annually by war service men, the winner to receive
a replica. The first winner was Mr. Norman Smith. In
addition to this cup the older members of the club, who first
played golf on Farrell’s paddock, subscribed for and pre-
sented to the club the Manly Golfer’s Cup. The first
competition for this was held in 1925 and won by Mr.
S. T. Jones.
In the Ladies Club Mrs. Triglone and Mrs. Barton won
the women’s N.S.W. Championship Foursome.
The sixth competition for the N.S.W. A.I.F. Cup took
place at Manly in 1925. There were 278 competitors and
it was fit and proper that Dr. Mervyn Thomas, a Manly
golfer, should be the winner.
In commenting on the finances of the club the committee
records that “ The Balance Sheet, showing the affairs of
the club, which is placed before you, exhibits a very sound
financial position. The repayment during the year of the
whole of the original Debentures marks an era of prosperity,
but it should not be forgotten that while the liability has
been discharged, there must always exist a debt of gratitude
to those eighty-five members of the club who came forward
in the time of need, and by their generous help placed the
club in the happy position of being able to complete negotia-
tions for the purchase of the links.”
With the possession of a club house, of which they could
be proud, the house committee promoted various social
functions during the year, including a ball in honour of the
officers of the American Fleet.


In the year 1927 Dr. A. Mackenzie, one of England’s
leading golf course architects, visited Australia and the
opportunity was taken by the Manly Club to obtain a report
from him on their links. As the result of the doctor’s
recommendations a considerable amount of improvements
were made on the course. The Ist, 4th and 15th holes
were made more interesting by rebunkering, the 6th green
was raised, and the fairway given a slight dog-leg direction.
The Bth green was extended.
Dr. Mackenzie in an interview said that golfers should
realize that bunkers were not designed to annoy players but
to make the game more interesting. The large army of
middle-aged middle-markers agreed with the doctor in
theory, but, in practice, were quite prepared to dispense
with any additional aids to the improvement of their game.
On the question of the extension of greens, however, with
one voice, they chorused approval.
In May, 1927, floods again proved a nuisance, as they
deposited large quantities of paspalum seed on the fairways
as well as quantities of sand.
An appreciation of the work of the Greens Committee,
under the acting-chairmanship of Dr. Moncrieff Barron
is contained in the report for the year 1927. The whole of
the work of reconstructing the course and repairing the
flood damage was carried out by the permanent staff, without
any extra cost.
In 1926 Mr. J. B. Ferrier was appointed Secretary of the
club on the resignation of Mr. Duret. He still holds this
position with a record of faithful service and a genial per-
sonality, a combination which has done much to advance
the welfare of the club.
CHAPTER TEN.
One of the most difficult problems facing a Greens
Committee is that of the beautification of the course. There
is a conflict of interests in so far as the player, as a golfer,
resents any undue interference, in the shape of trees and
shrubs, with his play, while in his moments of ease, from
the club balcony, he wishes to look on a fair prospect. In
1924 the club tackled the problem, by the appointment of
a Tree Planting and Beautification Committee. The com


mittee obtained expert advice and commenced their labours
by planting trees on the course. In 1925 Mr. H. J. Solomon
presented some 1,800 trees and shrubs to the club and per-
sonally supervised the planting. Twenty years later mem-
bers have reason to express their gratitude to Mr. Solomon
and the members of the Beautification Committee.
The main work carried out in 1928 was in the improvement
of the drainage of the course. The fairways of the sth, 6th,
7th and 10th holes were raised and a new drain was laid in
Addiscombe Road, to carry off water from the links. Exist-
ing drains also were widened and deepened. The cost of
the new drain was largely borne by the Manly Municipal
Council and the Warringah Shire Council.
One of the club’s prizes was a trophy presented by Dr.
David Thomas, to be awarded to the most improved player
during the year. In the year 1929 this trophy was won by a
young man named Jim Ferrier (son of Secretary J. B.
Ferrier) whose handicap during the year was reduced from
Bto scratch. He won also the Manly Summer Cup, and,
with Mrs. Geraghty, the Gr. J. Wilkinson trophy for mixed
foursomes. It would require several pages of this book to
detail the trophies and events won by Jim Ferrier since
1929. Many of them were won in competition with the
world’s champions. In 1936 Ferrier won the Gleneagles
Silver Tassie, the Golf Illustrated Gold Vase and he was
runner up in the British Amateur Championship at St.
Andrews.
As we all have cause to remember, the year 1930 ushered
in the world depression. Naturally golf clubs, coming
under the heading of luxuries, felt the effect of the depres-
sion keenly. In Manly there was a decrease in subscriptions
and entrance fees, but by strict economy the club finished
the year with a surplus of £684 ; a result, the report remarks
“ particularly satisfactory in view of the abnormal conditions
and difficulties of the year just passed.”
******
In more or less chronological order the history of the
club has now been recorded up to the year 1930* The club
had now reached maturity. The pioneering stage had
passed ; the course in its main features was nearly complete ;
a handsome club house gave scope for comfort and enjoy-
ment of the social life of the club. As winner on two


occasions of the triple premiership in inter-club golf and the
premiership in the A grade in other years, the club had
achieved a distinctive place in Australian golf, and, finan-
cially, the club was in a sound position.
Taking into consideration that all this was achieved in
twenty-five years, starting with a capital of less than one
hundred pounds, there is reason for writing that it was a
fine achievement.
The fifteen years that have elapsed since 1930 have
been a period of consolidation. Tree planting has been
continued. Most of the fairways are now tree fined, re-
placing the original bare aspect with pleasant vistas. During
the years 1936 and 1937 additional drainage of the course
was carried out by placing agricultural pipes in the fairways
and cutting additional drains to carry off the waters. After
a flood the course is now drained more efficiently than in
the past. A number of the greens have been reconstructed
including the 2nd, nth and 15th and a great improvement
in the course was devised by reconstructing the 12th and
16th greens, making a double green of the area. The
introduction of Bent grass into the greens has proved a great
success and most of the greens are now planted in this grass.
Additional bunkers were introduced into various parts of
the course adding more interest to the game. In 1935 it
was decided that an extension of the club house was desirable
and a contract was let for extending the house on the west
side. Provision was made for a large lounge room and a locker
room for the Associates and accommodation for the pro-
fessional. The estimated cost was £2,500. The extension
was opened on June 6, 1936.
In 1935 Mr. C. F. W. Lloyd announced that he did not
intend to offer himself for re-election as president, in the
coming year. Mr. Lloyd had held the office since 1926
and the committee placed on record that the “ service
rendered by him during his ten years of office has been of
the greatest value to the club. Your Committee feel sure
that their regret will be shared by every member.”
Mr. Lloyd was succeeded as president by Mr. W. C.
Sturrock who held the office until 1941. Like Mr. Lloyd
it could be written of Mr. Sturrock that his services had
been “of the greatest value to the club.” As a member
of the A grade team and as a committeeman Mr. Sturrock
for many years was a stalwart of the club.

Below —Entrance to Club House.


Mr. R. S. Harris has occupied the presidential chair
since 1942, after serving on the committee for a number of
years and filling the office of Vice-president.
To the long list of his successes in the golfing world
Mr. Jim Ferrier added another in the year 1936. He won
the N.S.W. Close Championship, which was held at Manly
in that year. In the final round Ferrier established the
amazing record score of 62. To commemorate the event
a replica of his scoring card has been added to the exhibits
in the lounge room of the club.
In 1938 Mr. F. W. Marks retired from the position of
honorary treasurer, an office he had held for thirteen years.
His knowledge of finance materially assisted the club, par-
ticularly during the trying years of the depression. When
Fred Marks died, in 1942, he was sincerely mourned by a
large circle of friends.
With 1939 came war again with its attendant troubles
for a golf club; decreased revenue and shortage of man-
power and supplies. Despite these handicaps the club
has managed to balance its budget each year. Only neces-
sary works have been carried out in the maintenance of the
links, and financial losses have been largely counterbalanced
by economy.
A good proportion of the members, staff and caddies,
eligible for war service, enlisted in the A.I.F. Unfortun-
ately a number will not return. The various war funds
have received contributions or articles from the club. The
Associates have been particularly active in this direction.
In 1940 they raised over £BOO for various funds and con-
tributed 2,658 articles, made by lady members, for the
comfort of the troops. This work has been continued
during all the war years.
In 1941 the club commenced the manufacture of camou-
flage nets and during the period, when these were required
by the forces, 3,007 nets were despatched to the depot.
In 1940 the club, as a whole, presented a motor ambulance
to the Army Medical Corps. A total of £1,500 has been
subscribed by the club to the Liberty Loans.
There were eighty-one members of the club in the Navy,
Army and Air Forces. The staff and caddies also are well
represented. During the year 1944 the playing membership
limit of 350 was reached and a provisional list was opened.
The history of the Associate section of the club, and
any events of importance have been incorporated in the


history as it developed. In Appendix E is a list of the
Ladies’ Office-bearers but it is fit and proper that those
hard-working officials, the honorary secretaries, on whom
the burden of the work fell, should be accorded more recog-
nition than an appendix confers, so here they are listed:
Mrs. A. V. Hilliard
Mrs. E. Duret
Mrs. A. Moore
Mrs. H. B. Brewer
Mrs. N. Foggitt
Mrs. H. S. Target!
Mrs. E. B. Backhouse
Miss B. Forssberg
Mrs. C. Campbell
Mrs. S. E. Travill.
Mrs. H. B. Brewer was elected the first captain of the
Associates in 1928. In 1940 Mrs. H. N. Barlex was elected
to the position and has been re-elected each year to date.
Mrs. E. B. Backhouse, was elected the first President,
in 1936, and has continued in office to the present year.
This record would be incomplete without a final word
of appreciation of the services rendered to the club by the
occupants of the office of Captain. During its forty years
of existence as a club only nine men have been called upon
to occupy this responsible position. Their names are:
Dr. R. J. Pope (1905-16); J. B. Ferrier (1917) ; A. L. Potter
(1918); Dr. David Thomas (1919-1925); L. M. Triggs
(1926-1929) ; Dr. G. M. Barron (1930); T. M. Fitzsimons
(1931-1935); Dr. M. Thomas (1936-1939) ; J. V. Strong
(1940-1945). The internal harmony of the club is largely
dependent on the tact and leadership of the Captain, and,
as chairman of the Greens Committee, he exercises a potent
influence in the improvement of the course. One can apply
to this worthy group of captains the words engraved on the
tomb of Sir Christopher Wren, the great architect of St.
Paul’s Cathedral, London, “ If you would see his monument,
look round you.”
To celebrate the conclusion of World War No. II the
members of the club subscribed a sum of £250, to promote
a competition for the golf professionals of Australia. It
was felt that a reunion of these players would do something
towards restoring pre-war conditions in the golf world.
The competition was held on Saturday, October 20, 1945.


There was an entry of forty-four players and an attendance
of some two thousand spectators. The winner was Norman
von Nida with rounds of 66 and 73. Eric Cremin filled
second place with scores of 69 and 72 and Martin Smith,
from Victoria was third with a 71 and 74.
Von Nida’s first round, of 66, established a professional
record for the course.
In the appendixes which follow (a list is printed below)
a record will be found of those club matters which lend
themselves to tabulation, including an income and expendi-
ture account for the year 1907, to provide an interesting
contrast with that for 1945.
******
Thackeray, in one of his poems, hailed the age of forty
as the “ age of wisdom ” and counselled youth to “ wait
till you come to forty year ” when a true focus is possible.
The club, whose history is recorded in the foregoing
pages, has now reached the “ age of wisdom ” ; it is forty
years old and we can view it as having reached manhood.
If I have done my work properly this record should
arouse, in the minds of the members of the Manly Golf
Club, a lively sense of gratitude to the men and women who
unselfishly laboured to create and perpetuate this pleasant
home of good fellowship.
