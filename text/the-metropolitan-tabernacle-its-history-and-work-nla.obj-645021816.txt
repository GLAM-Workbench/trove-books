PREFACE.
When modest ministers submit their sermons to the press they usually
place upon the title page the words “Printed by Request." We might
with emphatic truthfulness have pleaded this apology for the present
narrative, for times without number friends from all parts of the world
have said, “ Have you no book which will tell us all about your work ?
Could you not give us some printed summary of the Tabernacle
history ? ” Here it is, dear friends, and we hope it will satisfy your
curiosity and deepen your kindly interest.
The best excuse for writing a history is that there is something to tell,
and unless we are greatly mistaken the facts here placed ou record are well
worthy of being known. In us they have aroused fervent emotions of
gratitude, and in putting them together our faith in God has been
greatly established: we hope, therefore, that in some measure our
readers will derive the same benefit. Strangers cannot be expected to
feel an equal interest with ourselves, but our fellow members, our
co-workers, our hundreds of generous helpers, and the large circle of
our hearty sympathizers cannot read our summary of the Lord’s
dealings with us without stimulus and encouragement.
Our young people ought to be told by their fathers the wondrous
things which God did in their day “ and in the old time before them.”
Such things are forgotten if they are not every now and then rehearsed
anew in the ears of fresh generations. “ Why should the wonders he
hath wrought be lost in silence and forgot ? ” We feel that we only
discharge a duty to the present and coming generations when we use
our pen for such a purpose.
Very graciously has the Lord dealt with us, and our own part of the
long story is by no means the least bright with tokens of his goodness.
Charged with egotism we may be, but if this be the penalty for
declaring that “ the Lord hath done great things for us whereof we
are glad,” we will bear it with easy patience. The Baptist character
of the book may trouble some thin-skinned readers of other denomi-
nations, but we appeal to their candour and ask them, if they were
writing the story of a Methodist or Presbyterian church, would they
think it needful, fitting, or truthful to suppress the peculiarities of the
case ? In all probability they would not have been less denominational
than we have been, or if they had succeeded in being so they would
have robbed their record of half its value and all its interest. We do
not expect in reading a life of Wesley to find his Arminianism and his
Methodism left out, nor ought any one to expect us to weed out
Believers’ Baptism and Calvinistic doctrine from the annals of a


Particular Baptist church. We are Calvinistic Baptists, and have no
desire to sail under false colours, neither are we ashamed of our
principles : if we were, we would renounce them to-morrow.
All controversial questions laid aside, dear reader, you will here see
how our fathers struggled and suffered for liberty of conscience in
former times, how their sons held fast the truths handed down to them,
and in a measure how a church “ upon whom the ends of the earth are
come ” still lives and flourishes by faith in the unseen God. How
often prayer has been answered in our experience, and what great
things faith has done for us, the latter part of this little book will show,
and yet not all nor a hundredth part has been told or could be told.
We have taken passages verbatim from other works whenever they
suited our purpose, and we have not mentioned the sources of our
information, for such details are not needed in a mere popular manual.
We end the matter in a word by saying that nothing here is original,
but everything borrowed. How could it be otherwise in a history?
Ours only is the setting; we could not make facts any more than
jewellers can make diamonds.
May the reader’s belief in prayer be increased, and his reliance upon
God strengthened, as he reads our testimony, and should he unhappily
be as yet unconverted, may he be led to believe in God, to rest in the
sacrifice of Jesus, and cast in his lot with the people of God.
Brethren, who have helped us so long, support our enterprises still
by your prayers, your efforts, and your gifts, and so shall our Zion
become increasingly a praise in the earth. To the Triune God be
praise that for two centuries his mercy has surrounded this portion of
his church, and that “ his hand is stretched out still.”

HISTORY OP THE CHURCH
MEETING IN THE
METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE.
CHAPTER I.—EARLIEST TIMES.
w?®focir HEN Knickerbocker commenced hia famous history of
New York, he felt it to be essential to begin with the
Creation of the world. We labour under no such
ti i m P ress i° n J an( l shall not therefore judge it needful to
') yWij&fV rfL give a complete history of the Christian Church in the
rst a £ es * n or^er t 0 introduce our brief sketch of the
i Church in the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Still, a few
historical memoranda as to the Christians commonly called Baptists,
will not be out of place. Our own belief is that these people are the
purest part of that sect which of old was everywhere spoken against, and
we are convinced that they have, bejond their brethren, preserved the
ordinances of the Lord Jesns as they were delivered unto the saints.
We care very little for the “ historical church ” argument, but if there
be anything in it at all, the plea ought not to be filched by the clients of
Rome, but should be left to that community which all along has held
by “ One Lord, one faith, and one baptism.” This body of believers
has not been exalted into temporal power, or decorated with worldly
rank, but it has dwelt for the most part in dens and caves of the
earth, “ destitute, afflicted, tormented,” and so has proved itself of the
house and lineage of the Crucified. The Church which most loudly claims
the apostolical succession wears upon her brow more of the marks of
Anti-Christ than of Christ; but the afflicted Anabaptists, in their past
history, have had such fellowship with their suffering Lord, and have
borne so pure a testimony, both to truth and freedom, that they need in
nothing to be ashamed. Their very existence under the calumnies and
persecutions which they have endured is a standing marvel, while their
unflinching fidelity to the Scriptures as their sole rule of faith, and their
adherence to the simplicity of gospel ordinances is a sure index of their
Lord’s presence among them.
2


It would not be impossible to show that the first Christians who dwelt
in this land were of the same faith and order as the churches now called
Baptists. The errors of the churches are all more or less modem and
those which have clustered around the ordinance of Baptism are by no
means so venerable for age as some would have us suppose The evidence
supplied by ancient monuments and baptisteries, which still remain, would
be conclusive in our favour were it not that upon this point the minds
of men are not very open to argument. Foregone conclusions and
established ecclesiastical arrangements are not easily shaken, hew
men care to follow truth when she leads them without the camp, and
calls them to take up their cross, and endure to be thought singular even
by their fellow Christians. However, we are not now writing upon the
question of believers’ baptism, and are content to leave its discussion for
another opportunity. We care more to be conformed to Scripture
itself than to the oldest of usages. The moss of antiquity cannot
command our veneration if it only garnishes error. The witness of
churches is well enough, but “ we have a more sure word of testimony
in the Bible itself. , ... ... „
We are content for present purposes to begin with a quotation trom
an adversary. That the (so-called) Anabaptists are no novelty in
England is admitted by those least likely to manufacture ancient
history for them. That rampant Ritualist, W. J. E. Bennett, of Frome,
in his book upon “the Unity of the Church Broken says:— The
historian Lingard tells us that there was a sect of fanatics who infested
the north of Germany, called Puritans. Usher calls them Waldenses;
Spelman, Paulicians, (the same as Waldenses). They gained ground
and spread all over England; they rejected all Romish ceremonies,
denied the authority of the Pope, and more particularly refused to
baptise infants. Thirty of them were put to death for their heretical
doctrines near Oxford ; but the remainder still held on to their opinions
in private, until the time of Henry 11. (1158); and the historian filler
tells us that wherever this heresy prevailed,—the churches were either
scandalously neglected or pulled down, and infants left unbaptisea.
We are obliged to Mr. Bennett for this history which is in all respects
authentic; and we take liberty to remark upon it, that the reign of
Henry 11. is a period far more worthy of being called remote, than the
reign of Plenry VIII., and if the Baptists could trace their pedigree no
further, the church of Thomas Oranmer could not afford to sneer at
them as a modern sect. Concerning the poor persecuted people who
are referred to in this extract, it seems that under Henry 11. they were
treated with those tender mercies of the wicked which are so notoriously
cruel “ They were apprehended and brought before a council of the
clergy at Oxford. Being interrogated about their religion, their teacher,
named Gerard, a man of learning, answered in their name, that they
were Christians, and believed the doctrines of the apostles. Upon a
more particular inquiry it was found that they denied several of the
received doctrines of the Church, such as purgatory, prayers for the dead,
and the invocation of saints ; and refusing to abandon these damnable
heresies, as they were called, they were condemned as incorrigible
heretics, and delivered to the secular arm to be punished, lhe Ring
(Henry II.) at the instigation of the clergy, commanded them to be


branded with a red-hot iron on the forehead, to be whipped through the
streets of Oxford, and, having their clothes cut short by their girdles,
to be turned into the open fields, all persons being forbidden to afford
them any shelter or relief, under the severest penalties. This cruel
sentence was executed with its utmost rigour; and it being the depth
of winter, all these unhappy persons perished with cold and hunger.”
Induced, no doubt, to flee to this country from the Continent by the
rumoured favour of Henry 11. to the Lollards, they found nothing of
the hospitality which they expected ; but for Jesus’ sake were accounted
the offscouring of all things. Lit tie did their enemies dream that, instead
of being stamped out, the (so-called) heresy of the Baptists would survive
and increase till it should command a company of faithful adherents to
be numbered by millions.
All along our history from Henry 11. to Henry VIII. there are traces
of the Anabaptists, who are usually mentioned either in connection with
the Lollards, or as coming from Holland. Especial mention is made
of their being more conspicuous when Anne of Cloves came to this
country as the unhappy spouse of that choice defender of the faith, the
eighth Harry. All along there must have been a great hive on the
Continent of these “ Reformers before the Reformation,” for despite their
being doomed to die almost as soon as they landed, they continued to
invade this country to the annoyance of the priesthood and hierarchy,
who knew by instinct the people who are their direst enemies, and
whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their sway.
It may not be known to our readers that the Baptists have their own
martyrology, and are in nothing behind the very first of the churches
of Christ in sufferings endured for the truth’s sake. A fine old volume
in the Dutch language, illuminated with the most marvellous en-
gravings, is in our possession. It is full of interesting details of brutal
cruelty and heroic endurance. From it we have taken the story of
Simon the Pedlar, as a specimen of the firmness and endurance of the
baptized believers in Flanders: one instance out of thousands :— *
“ About the year 1553, at Bergen-op-Zoon, in Brabant, there was a
pedlar named Simon, standing in the market selling his wares. The
priests with their idol—the host—passing by, the said Simon dared not
show the counterfeit god any divine honour; but following the testi-
mony of God in the Holy Scriptures, he worshipped the Lord his God
only, and him alone served. He was therefore seized by the advocates
of the Romish Antichrist, and examined as to his faith.- This he
boldly confessed. He rejected infant baptism as a mere human inven-
tion, with all the commandments of men, holding fast the testimony of
the word of God; he was therefore condemned to death by the enemies
of the truth. They led him outside the town, and for the testimony
of Jesus committed him to the flames. The astonishment of the
bystanders was greatly excited when they saw the remarkable boldness
and stedfastness of this pious witness of God, who, through grace, thus
obtained the crown of everlasting life.
“ The bailiff, who procured his condemnation, on his return home
* A partial reprint of this volume was issued by the Hanserd-Knolly’s Society in
two volumes, entitled, “A Martyrology of the Churches of Christ, commonly called
Baptists, during the era of the Reformation.”


SIMON REFUSING TO WORSHIP THE HOST.


from the execution, fell mortally sick, and was confined to his bed. In
his suffering and sorrow he continually exclaimed, ‘ Oh, Simon, Simon!'
The priegts and monks sought to absolve him ; but he would not be
comforted. He speedily expired in despair, an instructive and memo-
rable example to all tyrants and persecutors.”
During the Reformation and after it, the poor Anabaptists continued
to be victims. Excesses had been committed by certain fifth-monarchy
men who happened also to be Baptists, and under cover of putting
down these wild fanatics, Motley tells us that “ thousands and tens of
thousands of virtuous, well-disposed men and women, who had as little
sympathy with anabaptistical as with Roman depravity, were butchered
in cold blood, under the sanguinary rule of Charles, in the Netherlands.”
The only stint allowed to persecution in the low countries was contained
in a letter of Queen Dowager Mary of Hungary: “ care being only taken
that the provinces were not entirely depopulated.” Luther and Zwingle,
though themselves held to be heretics, were scarcely a whit behind the
Papists in their rage against the Anabaptists, Zwingle especially utter-
ing that pithy formula, —“ Qut ilerum mergit mergatur” thereby
counselling the drowning of all those who dared to immerse believers on
profession of their faith. The time will probably arrive when history
will be rewritten, and the maligned Baptists of Holland and Germany
will be acquitted of all complicity with the ravings of the insane
fanatics, and it will be proved that they were the advance-guard of the
army of religious liberty, men who'lived before their times, bnt whose
influence might have saved the world centuries of floundering in the bog
of semi-popery if they had but been allowed fair play. As it was, their
views, like those of modern Baptists, so completely laid the axe at the
root of all priestcraft and sacramentarianism, that violent opposition
was aroused, and the two-edged sword of defamation and extirpation
was set to its cruel work, and kept to it with a relentless perseve-
rance never excelled, perhaps never equalled. All other sects
may be in some degree borne with, but Baptists are utterly intolerable
to priests and Popes ; neither can despots and tyrants endure them.
We will leave the continental hive, to return to our brethren in
England. Latimer, who could not speak too badly of the Baptists,
nevertheless bears witness to their numbers and intrepidity. “ Here I
have to tell you what I heard of late, by the relation of a credible person
and a worshipful man, of a town in this realm of England, that hath about
five hundred of heretics of this erroneous opinion in it. The Ana-
baptists that were burnt here, in divers towns of England (as I have heard
of credible men, I saw them not myself), met their death even intrepid,
as you will sav, without any fear in the world. Well, let them go.
There was, in the old times, another kind of poisoned heretics, that were
called Donatists, and those heretics went to their execution as they
should have gone to some jolly recreation and banquet.” Latimer had
ere long to learn for himself where the power lay which enabled men to
die so cheerfully. We do not wonder that he discovered a likeness between
the Baptists and the Donatists, for quaint old Thomas Fuller draws at
full length a parallel between the two, and concludes that the Baptists
are only “ the old Donatists new dipped.” We can survive even such a
comparison as that.


Bishop Burnet says that in the time of Edward VI. Baptists became
very numerous, and openly preached this doctrine, that “ children aie
Christ's without water" (Luke xviii. 16). Protestantism nominally
flourished in the reign of Edward VI., but there were many unpro-
testant doings. The use of the reformed liturgy was enforced by the
pains and penalties of law. Ridley, himself a martyr in the next reign,
was joined in a commission with Gardiner, afterwards notorious as a
persecutor of Protestants, to root out Baptists. Among the ‘ Articles of
Visitation,” issued by Ridley in his own diocese, in 1550, was the follow-
ing : “ Whether any of the Anabaptists’ sect, and others, use notoriously
any unlawful or private conventicles, wherein they do use doctrines or
administration of sacraments, separating themselves from the rest of the
parish ? ” It may be fairly gathered from this “ article of visitation ”
that there were many Baptist churches in the kingdom at that time.
This truth is also clear from the fact that the Duke of Northumberland
advised that Mr. John Knox should be invited to England, and made a
bishop, that he might aid in putting down the Baptists in Kent.
Marsden tells us that in the days of Elizabeth “ the Anabaptists were
the most numerous and for some time by far the most formidable
opponents of the church. They are said to have existed in England
since the early days of the Lollards.”
In the year 1575 a most severe persecution was raised against the
Anabaptists in London, ten of whom were condemned,—eight ordered
to be banished, and two to be executed. Mr. Foxe, the eminent martyr-
ologist, wrote an excellent Latin letter to the Queen, in which he
observes “ That to punish with the flames the bodies of those who err
rather from ignorance than obstinacy is cruel, and more like the Church
of Rome than the mildness of the gospel. I do not write thus,” says
he, “ from any bias to the indulgence ot error; but to save the lives of
men, being myself a man ; and in hope that the offending parties may
have an opportunity to repent and retract their mistakes. . He then
earnestly entreats that the fires of Smithfield may not be rekindled, but
that some milder punishment might be inflicted upon them, to prevent,
if possible, the destruction of their souls as well as their bodies. . But
his remonstrances were ineffectual. The Queen remained inflexible;
and, though she constantly called him Father Foxe, she gave him a flat
denial as to saving their lives, unless they would recant their dangerous
errors. They both refusing to recant were burnt in Smithfield, July 22,
1575, to the great and lasting disgrace of the reign and character of
Queen Elizabeth.
Neither from Elizabeth, James, or Charles I. had our brethren any
measure of favour. No treatment was thought too severe for them: even
good men execrated them as heretics for whom the harshest measures were
too gentle. Had it been possible to destroy this branch of the true vine,
assuredly the readiest means were used without hindrance or scruple, and
yet it not only lives on, but continues to bear fruit a hundredfold.
When Charles I. was unable any longer to uphold Episcopacy, liberty
of thought and freedom of speech were somewhat more common than
before, and the Baptists increased very rapidly. Many of them were
in Cromwell’s army, and were the founders of not a few of our village
churches. When these men were to the front doing such acceptable


work for the Parliament, it was not likely that their brethren could be
hunted down quite so freely as before. Accordingly we find that con-
tentious divine, Daniel Featley, groaning heavily, because they wereper-
mitted to breathe, and between his pious groans recording for our in-
formation certain facts which are, at this juncture, peculiarly useful
° Dr. Featley says : —“ This fire which in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth
and King James, and our gracious sovereign [Charles I.] till now was
covered in England under the ashes; or if it brake out at any time,
by the care of the ecclesiastical and civil magistrates, it was soon put
out. But of late, since the unhappy distractions which our sins have
brought upon us, the temporal sword being otherways employed, and
the spiritual locked up fast in the scabbard, this sect among others has
so far presumed upon the patience of the State, that it hath held
weekly conventicles, re-baptized hundreds of men and women together
in the twilight, in rivulets, and some arms of the Thames, and else-
where, dipping them over head and ears. It hath printed divers
pamphlets in defence of their heresy, yea, and challenged some of our
preachers to disputation. Now although my bent has always been
hitherto against the most dangerous enemy of our Church and State,
the Jesuit, to extinguish such balls of wildfire as they have east into
the bosom of our Church; yet seeing this strange fire kindled in the
neighbouring parishes, and many Nadabs and Abihus offering it on
God’s altar, I thought it my duty to cast the water of Siloam upon it
to extinguish it.” The waters of Siloam must have been strangely foul
in Featley’s days if his “ Dippers Dipped ” is to be regarded as a
bucketful of the liquid.
The neighbouring region which was so sorely vexed with “ strange
fire ” was- the borough of Southwark, which is the region in which the
church now meeting in the Metropolitan Tabernacle was born. W e
are not aware that any of its pastors, or indeed any Baptist pastor in
the universe, ever set up for a priest, and therefore the Nadabs and
Abihus must be looked for elsewhere, but Dr. Featley no doubt intended
the compliment for some of our immediate ancestors.
The fortunes of war brought a Presbyterian parliament into power, but
this was very little more favourable to religious liberty than the
dominancy of the Episcopalians; at least the Baptists did not find
it so. Mr. Edwards, a precious brother of the stern “ true blue ” school,
told the magistrates that “ they should execute some exemplary punish-
ment upon some of the most notorious sectaries, and he charges the
wicked Baptists with “ dipping of persons in the cold water in winter,
whereby persons fall sick.” He kindly recommends the magistrates to
follow the example of the Zurichers who drowned the dippers, and if
this should not be feasible he urges that they should at least be pro-
ceeded against as rogues and vagabonds. No party at that time under-
stood religious liberty to mean anything more than liberty for them-
selves. The despised Anabaptists and Quakers and Independents alone
perceived that consciences are under no human rule, but owe allegiance
to the Lord alone. Even the Puritans considered universal toleration
to be extremely dangerous. All the powerful churches thought it right
to repress heresy (so called) by the secular power. Things have


gloriously altered now. No Presbyterian would now endorse a word of
Edwards’s bitterness. Thank God, the light has come, and Christian
men heartily accord liberty to each other. The day we trust is not far
distant when even the Episcopal body will allow us to bury our dead
in the National graveyards, and will wish to escape from that con-
nection with the State which is as injurious to itself as it is obnoxious to
other churches.
Moved by the feeling that it was the duty of the state to keep men s
consciences in nroper order, the Parliament set to work to curb the
wicked sectaries, and Dr. Stoughton tells us: By the Parliamentary
ordinance of April, 1645, forbidding any person to preach who was not
an ordained minister, in the Presbyterian, or some other reformed
church—all Baptist ministers became exposed to molestation, they being
accounted a sect, and not a church. A few months after the date of
this law, the Baptists being pledged to a public controversy in London
with Edmund Calamv, the Lord Mayor interfered to prevent the dis-
putation —a circumstance which seems to show that, on the one hand,
the Baptists were becoming a formidable body in London, and, on the
other hand, that their fellow-citizens were highly exasperated against
them.” Or, say rather, that the Lord Mayor’s views not being those
of the Baptists, he feared the sturdy arguments which would be brought
to bear upon his friends, and concluded that the wisest course he could
take was to prevent the truth being heard. No Lord Mayor, or even
king, has any right to forbid free public speech, and when in past ages
an official has done so, it is no evidence that his fellow-citizens were of
the same mind: Jack-in-office is often peculiarly anxious that the con-
sciences of others should not be injured by hearing views different from
his own. . .
We have now come to the margin of the actual personal history ot
our own church, without, we trust, having quite exhausted our reader’s
patience.


CHAPTER II.—THE FIRST TWO PASTORS.
some one of the mapy Baptist assemblies which
7 * n k° rol:i gh of Southwark our church took
r * Be * Crosby says: “ This people had formerly
J belonged to one of the most ancient* congregations of
the Baptists in London, but separated from them in
the year 1652, for some practices which they judged
and kept together from that time as a
distinct body.” They appear to have met in private houses, or in
such other buildings as were open to them. Their first pastor was
WILLIAM RIDER,
whom Crosby mentions as a sufferer for conscience sake, but he
is altogether unable to give any further particulars of his life, except
that he published a small tract in vindication of the practice of laying
on of hands on the baptised believers. The people were few in
number, but had the reputation of being men of solid judgment, deep
knowledge, and religious stability, and many of them were also in easy
circumstances as to worldly goods. Oliver Cromwell was just at
that time in the ascendant, and Blake’s cannon were sweeping the
Dutch from the seas, but the Presbyterian establishment ruled with a
heavy hand, and Baptists were under a cloud. In the following year
Cromwell was made Protector, the old parliament was sent about
its business, and England enjoyed a large measure of liberty of con-
science. Mr. Henry Jessey was at that time miuister of St. George’s
Church, Southwark, and being a man of great weight, both as to
character and learning, and also a Baptist, there is no doubt that Baptist
views had a marvellous sway throughout the borough of Southwark and
adjacent places. If it be asked how a parish minister became
a Baptist, we reply, Jessey first preached against immersion, and
by his own arguments converted himself to the views which he
had opposed, practising for some time the dipping of children. Finding
that many of his people repaired to Baptist conventicles, he studied the
subject still further in order to be prepared to face these robbers of
churches, and the result was that he was convinced of the Scriptural
nature of their opinions and was immersed by Mr. Hanserd Knollys.
This circumstance tended greatly to strengthen the hands of the many
Baptist churches on the south side of the river, and, no doubt, Mr. Rider’s
people were partakers of the benefit. This would seem to have been a


period of much religious heartsearching in which the ordinances of
churches were tried by the word of God, and men were determined to
retain nothing which was not sanctioned by divine authority; hence
there were many public disputes upon Baptism, and, in consequence,
many became adherents of believers’ immersion, and Baptist churches
sprung up on all sides. Truth suffers nothing from free discussion, it
is indeed the element in which it most freely exerts its power. We
have personally known several instances in which sermons in defence of
Infant Baptism have driven numbers to more Scriptural views, and we
have felt that if Psedo-baptists will only preach upon the subject we
shall have little to do but to remain quiet and reap the sure results.
It is a dangerous subject for any to handle who wish their people to
abide by the popular opinion on this matter.
How long William Rider exercised the ministerial office we are
unable to tell, but our next record bears date 1668, when we are
informed that, “ the pastor having been dead for some time, they
unanimously chose
MR. BENJAMIN REACH
to be their elder or pastor.” Accordingly he was solemnly ordained
with prayer and the laying on of hands in the year 1668, being in the
28th year of his age. As Reach was one of the most notable of the
pastors of our church, we must diverge awhile from the beaten track
to describe his sufferings for the truth’s sake previous to his coming to
London. He was continually engaged in preaching in the towns of
Buckinghamshire, making Winslow his head quarters; and so well did
the good cause flourish under his zealous labours, and those of others,
that the government quartered dragoons in the district in order to put
down unlawful meetings, and stamp out dissent. The amount of
suffering which this involved the readers of the story of the Covenanting
times in Scotland can readily imagine. A rough soldiery handle with
little tenderness those whom they consider to be miserable fanatics.
When the favourite court poet was lampooning these poor people, and
ridiculing their claims to be guided by the Spirit of God, common
soldiers of the cavalier order were not likely to be much under restraint
in their behaviour to them. Thus sang Butler concerning the divine
light, in lines which the court gallants loved to repeat, but which we
cannot quote entire, for they verge on blasphemy—
“ For as of vagabonds we say,
That they are ne’er beside the way ;
Whate’er men speak by this new light,
Still they are sure to be i’ th’ right.
A light that falls down from on high,
For spiritual trades to cozen by.
An ignis fatuus that bewitches
And leads men into pools and ditches,
To make them dip themselves, and sound
For Christendom in dirty pond;
• To dive, like wildfowl, for salvation ;
And fish to catch regeneration.’’


Keach was often in prison, and his meetings were frequently disturbed.

WINSLOW MEETING-HOUSE.
In 1664, Mr. Reach published a little book for the use of children,
entitled, “ The Child's Instructor; or , a New and Easy Primmer.” This
one would think must have been a harmless work enough, but his
enemies did not think so. A weak cause is afraid of even the feeblest
adversary. His little books were seized, and he himself was summoned
to appear at the assizes at Aylesbury, October 8,1664. The indictment
against him will not, we trust, distress the reader : he need not dread the
pollution of his mind or the depraving of his morals. Police reports
are not nowadays quite 60 theological. Serious as the charges are,
there are few men of our times who would think it any dishonour to be
found guilty of them.
“ Mr. Reach being brought to the bar, the clerk said, Benjamin Reach,
hear your charge. Thou art here indicted by the name of Benjamin
Reach, of Winslow, in the county of Bucks, for that thou being a
seditious, schismatic person, evilly and maliciously disposed and dis-
affected to his Majesty’s government, and the government of the Church
of England, didst maliciously and wickedly on the fifth of May, in the
sixteenth year of the reign of our sovereign lord the Ring, write, print,
and publish, or cause to be written, printed, and published, one sedi-
tious and venomous book entitled, ‘ The Child's Instructor; or, a New
and Easy Primmer wherein are contained, by way of question and
answer, these damnable positions, contrary to the Book of Common
Prayer and the liturgy of the Church of England; that is to say, in
one place you have thus written :
* Q. Who are the right subjects for baptism?
* A. Believers, or godly men and women, who make profession of
their faith and repentance.


« In another place you have maliciously and wickedly written these
words : ' 1 Q. How shall it go with the saints when Christ cometh ?
A. Very well; it is the day they have longed for. Then shall they hear
the sentence, “ Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you and so shall they reign with Christ on the earth a
thousand years, even on Mount Sion in the New Jerusalem.
“ In another place you have wickedly and maliciously written these
plain English words ‘Q. Why may not infants be received into the
Church now as they were under the law ? A. Because the fleshly seed
is cast out. Though God under that dispensation did receive infants
in a lineal way by generation ; yet he that hath the key of David, that
openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth, hath
shut up this way into the Church, and opened the door of regeneration,
receiving in none now but true believers. Q. What is the case of
infants? A. Infants that die are members of the kingdom of glory,
though they be not members of the visible church. Q. Do they, then,
that bring in infants in a lineal way by generation, err from the way of
truth ? A. Yea, they do; for they make not God's holy word their
rule, but do presume to open a door that Christ hath shut, and none
ought to open.’ ” .
The indictment appears to have contained an amusing clerical error,
which charged Keach with writing, that the rest of the devils, would
be raised when the thousand years were ended. Many an indictment
has been quashed for a far less serious mistake, but the judge would
not listen to the objections of the jury, whom he bullied somewhat
after the manner of Jeffries. He bade them bring him in guilty with
that exception , and when this was done he pronounced the following
sentence :
Judge. “ Benjamin Keach, you are here convicted for writing,
printing, and publishing a seditious and schismatical book, for which
the court's judgment is this, arid the court doth award: That you shall
go to gaol for a fortnight without bail or mainprize; and the next
Saturday to stand upon the pillory at Aylesbury in the open market,
from eleven o’clock till one, with a paper upon your head with this
inscription: For writing, printing, and publishing a schismatical book,
entitled, The Childs Instructor; or, a New and Easy Primmer. And the
next Thursday to stand, in the same manner and for the same time,
in the market at Winslow ; and then your book shall be openly burnt
before your face by the common hangman, in disgrace of you and your
doctrine. And you shall forfeit to the King’s majesty the sum of
twenty pounds, and shall remain in gaol until you find sureties for
vour good behaviour, and for your appearance at the next assizes ; then
to renounce your doctrines, and make such public submission as shall be
enjoined you. Take him away, keeper ! ”
Keach simply replied, “ I hope I shall never renounce the truths
which I have written in that book.”
The attempts made to obtain a pardon or a relaxation of this severe
sentence were ineffectual; and the sheriff took care that everything
should be punctually performed.
When he was brought to the pillory at Aylesbury, several of his
religious friends and acquaintances accompanied him : and when they


bemoaned his hard case and the injustice of his sufferings, he said with
a cheerful countenance, “ The cross is the way to the crown.” His
head and hands were no sooner placed in the pillory, but he began to
address himself to the spectators, to this effect:— ‘ Good people, lam
not ashamed to stand here this day, with this paper on my head ! my
Lord Jesus was not ashamed to suffer on the cross for me ; and it is
for his cause that I am made a gazing-stock. Take notice, it is not for
any wickedness that I stand here ; but for writing and publishing those
truths which the Spirit of the Lord hath revealed in the Holy
Scriptures.”
A clergyman that stood by could not forbear interrupting him, and
said, “It is for writing and publishing errors; and you may now see
what your errors have brought you to.”
Mr. Keach replied, “ Sir, can you prove them errors ?” but before the
clergyman could return an answer he was attacked by some from among
the people. One told him of his being pulled drunk out of a ditch :
another upbraided him with being lately found drunk under a haycock.
At this all the people fell to laughing, and turned their derision from
the sufferer in the pillory to the drunken priest! insomuch that he
hastened away with the utmost disgrace and shame. After the noise
BENJAMIN REACH IN THE PILLORY.
of this was oyer, the prisoner began to speak again, saying, “ It is no
new thing for servants of the Lord to suffer, and be made a gazing-
stock ; and you that are acquainted with the. Scriptures know, that the
way to the crown is by the cross. The apostle saith, that ‘ through
much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of heaven’; and


Christ saith, ‘He that is ashamed of me and my words, of him shall
the Son of Man be ashamed, before my Father, and before his holy
angels.’ ” He was frequently interrupted by the jailor, who told him
that he must not speak, and that if he would not be silent, he must
force him to it. After he had stood some time silent, getting one of
his hands at liberty, he pulled his Bible out of his pocket, and held it
up to the people ; saying, “ Take notice, the things which 1 have written
and published, and for which I stand here this day, a spectacle to men
and angels, are all contained in this book, as I could prove out of the
same, if I had an opportunity.”
At this the jailor interrupted him again, and with great anger
enquired, who gave him the book ; some said, his wife, who was near
unto him, and frequently spake in vindication of her husband and the
principles for which he suffered: but Mr. Keach replied, and said that
he took it out of his pocket. Upon this the jailor took it away from
him, and fastened up his hand again. But it was almost impossible to
keep him from speaking; for he soon began again, saying to this effect:
“ It seems I cannot be suffered to speak to the cause for which I stand
here ; neither could I be suffered the other day (on his trial, I suppose
he meant), but it will plead its own innocency, when the strongest of
its opposers shall be ashamed. Ido not speak this out of prejudice to
any person, but do sincerely desire that the Lord would convert them,
and convince them of their errors, that their souls may be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus. Good people, the concernment of souls is very
great! so great that Christ died for them : and truly a concernment
for souls was that which moved me to write and publish those things
for which I now suffer, and for which I could suffer far greater things
than these. It concerns you, therefore, to be very careful; otherwise it
will be very sad with you at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from
heaven ; for we must all appear before his tribunal.” Here he was
interrupted again, and forced to be silent for some time. But at length
he ventured to speak again : saying, “ I hope the Lord’s people will not
be discouraged at my suffering. Oh ! did you but experience,” says he,
“ the great love of God, and the excellencies that are in Him, it would
make you willing to go through any sufferings for his sake. And Ido
account this the greatest honour that ever the Lord was pleased to
confer upon me.”
After this, he was not suffered to speak much more ; for the sheriff
came in a great rage, and said, if he would not be silent he should be
gagged; and the officers were ordered to keep the people at a greater
distance from him, though they declared they could not do it. At the
end of a long silence he ventured again : “ This,” says he, “ is one
yoke of Christ, which I find by experience is easy to me, and a burthen
which he doth make light.” But finding that he could not be suffered
to speak, he kept silence till the whole two hours were expired ; only
uttering this sentence, “ Blessed are they that are persecuted for right-
eousness’ sake : for their’s is the kingdom of heaven.” When the full
time acgording to his sentence was expired, the under-keeper lifted up
the board, and as soon as his head and hands were at liberty he blessed
God with a loud voice for his great goodness unto him.

with Mr. Cook,


a constable, came in and seized six persons, and had them before
Justice Reading, who bound them over to appear at the quarter ses-
sions. At another time they met together at the widow Colfe’s house
at Kennington, to celebrate the Lord’s Supper. At the conclusion
they sang a hymn, which soon brought the officers of the parish to
them; but from the conyeniency of a back door they all escaped except
one, who, turning back again for something he had left behind, was
apprehended and taken. He was carried before a justice of the peace,
who committed him to prison, where he continued till some of his
friends obtained bail for him. At the next quarter sessions he was
fined, and the fine paid. The widow Colfe, at whose house they met,
had a king’s messenger sent to apprehend her ; but being informed that
she was nurse to one who lay sick of the small-pox, he departed with an
oath, and sought no more after her. Mr. Keach after this was sought
for, by one of the king’s messengers of the press, for printing a little
book called The Child's Instructor. This book, as near as he could
make it, was the same for which he was imprisoned and put into the
pillory; the other being then not to be obtained, though he sought
greatly after it. He was at this time tenant to that noted informer
Cook, but not known to him by his name. The which, when he came
to know, he told him that one of the king’s messengers was in quest
of him, and for his sake, as a tenant, he screened him. But at length
he was taken up by a warrant, left by the said messenger with another
man in their neighbourhood, and was carried before Justice Glover.
The Justice being informed of an ancient gentleman of worth and
credit (who was one of the members of Mr. Reach’s church, viz., John
Roberts, doctor of physic), sent for him ; and when he came, asked him
if he knew that man, pointing to Mr. Keach. The doctor answered,
Yes, very well. Then said the Justice, Will you be bound for him?
Yes, replied the doctor, body for body. The doctor’s bail was taken,
Mr. Keach was discharged; but in the issue, he was fined twenty
pounds ; the which he was obliged to pay, when others, under the like
circumstances, escaped through the insufficiency of the bail that was
generally taken in those times.” The pastor evidently had a warm
place in the hearts of his people, and they were willing to back him up
when called before the great ones of the earth for Christ’s sake. He
must have endured much labour in those perilous times, for the church
met in several sections at different houses, and the pastor hastened
from one house to another, having thus to preach several times on
each Sabbath, evading the watchful eyes of churchwardens, constables,
and informers as best he could.
Benjamin Keach was one of the most useful preachers of his time,
and built up the church of God with sound doctrine for thirty-six
years. Having been in his very earliest days an Arminian, and having
soon advanced to Calvinistic views, he preserved the balance in his
preaching, and was never a member of that exclusive school which
deems it to be unsound to persuade men to repent and believe. He was
by no means so highly Calvinistic as his great successor, I)r. Gill; but
evidently held much the same views as are now advocated from the
pulpit of the Tabernacle. Nor must it be supposed that he was in-
cessantly preaching upon believers’ Baptism, and other points of


fundamental truths of our holy gospel, Benjamin

and yet more by the conversion and baptism of some of his flock. To
put an end to this business he went down to the Baptist meeting with
a company of his parishioners, and actually held the pulpit for two hour
and discoursed upon infant baptism. This unwarrantable intrusior
produced a degree of warmth on both sides, but to Mr. Burkitt must b
conceded the pre-eminence in abuse. In a book which he afterwards issuec
the rector used the following choice language: “ Since the late genera
liberty, the Anabaptists, thinking themselves thereby let loose upon us
have dispersed themselves into several counties, endeavouring to drai r
away our people from us, by persuading them to renounce their firsi;
dedication to God in baptism, and to enter into their communion by wa r
of dipping. One of their teaching disciples has set up in our neigh
bourhood for making proselytes, by baptising them in a nasty horse
pond, into which the filth of the adjacent stable occasionally flows, anc
out of which his deluded converts come forth with so much mud anc
filthiness upon them, that they rather resemble creatures arising out o ‘
the bottomless pit, than candidates of holy baptism ; and all this before
a promiscuous multitude, in the face of the sun.” When so respectable
a person as Mr. Burkitt could condescend to give currency to such
ridiculous falsehoods, it was time that he should be withstood by some
one who could teach him better manners. His calumnies were
answered by the testimonies of those present at the baptism, and his
reasonings were confuted by Mr. Keach in his book entitled “ The
Rector Rectified Christian courtesy would seem to have been at a
discount when the titles of controversial pamphlets were of the kind
indicated by the following—“ The Anabaptists washt and washt, and
shrunk m the washing; ” and when texts were explained in violation of
all reason, as for instance Lev. xi. 17, “The owl, the cormorant, and the
great owl”—“the little owl resembles the unbaptized child, the great
owl the Anabaptist parent, and the cormorant betwixt them the wide-
throated preacher that divides child from parent, dives into them and
swallows their souls.” Mr. Keach had his hands full of disputes with
Havel and men of less note, but he deplored rather than delighted in
them, and often lamented the unchristian spirit of those who denied
that the Baptist churches were churches at all, and otherwise oppro-
briously assailed brethren with whom they were agreed in all other
matters. He had no cause to shrink from combat on his own account,
for he was so able a polemic that sometimes the mere outline of his
argument sufficed to let his opponents see that they had no very
desirable task before them. An amusing instance of this is recorded
by Crosby in the following paragraph :
“ He was challenged by some ministers of the Church of England,
not far from London, to dispute on baptism ; and the place appointed
was at Gravesend. As he was going thither in a Gravesend boat, ill
company with others, there happened to be a clergyman in the same
boat with him. The conversation Mr. Keach had in the boat, with
some ot his friends, caused this clergyman to suspect he was the person
going to dispute with his brethren, and accordingly he attacked him
in the boat, and from hence saw the defence he was able to make, and
what little credit would be obtained on their side of the question. As
soon as the boat arrived at Gravesend this clergyman hastened to his


friends, and let them know the conversation he had had with Mr. Keach
in the boat, and what arguments he intended to urge ; which put an
entire stop to the disputation, and Mr. Keach returned to London again
without seeing any one of them. Though they had rendered the
Baptists as contemptible as they could by stating that they had nothing
to say for their practice in baptising adult persons, yet when all came
to all, not one of them dared to appear and defend what they had spoken.”
Another method of usefulness very largely used by Mr. Keach was
the publication of books. He is the author of two well-known folios,
“Key to open Scripture Metaphors ,” and an “Exposition of the
Parables .” These works have long enjoyed a high repute, and though
they are now regarded as out of date, the time was when they were so


universally used by ministers, the “ Key to the Metaphors” especially,
that Dr. Adam Clarke complains of the too great dependence of preachers
upon them. Reach wrote in all forty-three works—eighteen practical,
sixteen polemical, and nine poetical. These books were mostly em-
bellished with curious wood-engravings and were sold as chap-books
by hawkers from town to town. Some of these, such as “ War with the
Devil ” and “ Travels of True Godliness ” must have been very popular,
for we have seen the 22nd editions, and there were probably more.
Those issued by Reach himself have most reputable engravings, in the
best style of art of those days, of which we have given two specimens
from one of his own editions, on this and the preceding page, but editions
subsequent to his death are produced in the very worst manner, and like


Hodge’s razors, were evidently only meant “to sell.” Our copy of the
wood block, of “ London in flames,” is rather a favorable specimen of
these wretched productions.
As for the poetry of Reach’s works, the less said the better. It is a
rigmarole almost equal to John Bunyan’s rhyming, but hardly up even
to the mark of honest John. We will inflict none of it upon our
readers, except a few lines from his “ War with the Devil ” :
“ I never read of Peter's triple crown,
Nor that he ever wore a Popish gown ;
I never learn’d that he did Pope become,
Or rul’d o’er kings, like to the beasts of Rome ,
I never learn’d he granted dispensations,
To poison kings or rulers of those nations
Who were profane, or turned hereticks,
Or did refuse the faith of Catholicks.
I read not that he’s called His Holiness,
Yet he’d as much as any Pope, I guess;
I never learn’d Peter did magnify
Himself above all gods, or God on high !
Or that upon the necks of kings he trod,
Or ever he in cloth of gold was clad ;
I never read that he made laws to burn
Such as were hereticks, and would not turn
To Jesus Christ, much less to murder those
Who did, in truth, idolatry oppose.
I never learn’d, nor could do, to this day,
That Pope and Peter walk’d both in one way;
Yea, or that they in anything accord,
Save only in denying of the Lord:
Peter deny’d him, yet did love him dear;
The Pope denies him, and doth hatred bear
To him, and to all those that do him love,
Who bear his image, and are from above.
Peter deny’d him, and did weep amain,
The Pope denies him but with great disdain.
Peter deny’d him, yet for him did die,
The Pope in malice doth him crucify.
Peter deny’d him thrice, and then repented,
The Pope a thousand times, but ne’er relented.”


Very sweetly did Mr. Reach preach the great fundamental truths of
the gospel, and glorify the name and work of Jesus. His “ Gospel
Mine Opened,” and other works, rich in savour, show that he was no
mere stickler for a point of ceremony, but one who loved the whole
truth as it is in Jesus, and felt its power. The doctrine of the Second
Advent evidently had great charms for him, but not so as to crowd
out Christ crucified. He was very solid in his preaching, and his
whole conduct and behaviour betokened a man deeply in earnest for
the cause of God. In addressing the ungodly he was intensely direct,
solemn, and impressive, not flinching to declare the terrors of the Lord,
nor veiling the freeness of divine grace. We quote a few sentences
from one of his sermons, only remarking that such clear evangelical
statements are found throughout all his works. “We preach to you,
sinners, that Jesus Christ will entertain you, if you come to him,
bid you welcome, and not cast you off, because of the greatness of your
sins, though you have no qualifications to recommend you to him.
Would you wash yourselves from your sins, and then come to the foun-
tain of his blood to be washed ? We hold forth Christ to be your whole
Saviour, and that he is ‘ set forth as the propitiation through faith in
his blood ,* * whom if you close with, and believe in, you shall be justi-
fied : we tell you God justifies the ungodly, i.e., they that are so before
being justified Therefore, sinners, though ’tis your duty to
reform your lives, and leave your abominable sins, which often bring
heavy judgments upon you in this world, and expose you to eternal
wrath in the world to come; yet know that all that you can do will
fail in point of your acceptation and justification in God’s sight, or to
save your souls : your present work and business is to believe in Jesus
Christ, to look to him, who only can renew his sacred image in your
souls, and make you new creatures, which must be done, or you perish.
0 cry that he would help your unbelief. Come, venture your souls on
Christ’s righteousness,- Christ is able to save you though you are ever
so great sinners. Come to him, throw yourselves at the feet of Jesus.
Loo/c to Jesus, who came to seek and save them that were lost. ‘ If any
man thirst, let him come unto me and drink,’ John vii. 37-38. You may
have the water of life freely. Do not say, ‘ I want qualifications or a
meetness to come to Christ.’ Sinner, dost thou thirst ? Dost thou see
a want of righteousness ? ’Tis not a righteousness ; but ’tis a sense of
the want of righteousness, which is rather the qualification thou
shouldst look at. Christ hath righteousness sufficient to clothe you,
bread of life to feed you, grace to adorn you. Whatever you want, it
is to be had in him. We tell you there- is help in him, salvationin him.
‘ Through the propitiation in his blood ’ you must be justified, and
that by faith alone.”
For the interests of his denomination Reach was a zealous and
judicious worker: he was one of the most earnest in inducing the
baptized churches to give a suitable maintenance to their ministers,
which partly from poverty and persecution, and partly also from
mistaken notions, they had very generally neglected to do. At an
assembly of a hundred churches which met in London, his little
book, “ The Ministers Maintenance vindicated,” was ordered to be dis-
persed among the congregations. Mr. Reach was also very greatly the


means of leading back the Baptists to the habit of congregational
singing. Because from fear of discovery by the magistrates the as-
semblies of believers had been unable to sing, the habit of songless
worship had been acquired in many congregations, and when happier
days gave opportunity for praising the Lord with the voice, the older
folks looked upon it as an innovation, and would have none of it.
“ When he was convinced that singing the praises of God was a holy
ordinance of Jesus Christ, he laboured earnestly and with a great deal
of prudence to convince his people thereof; and first obtained their
consent to the practice of it at the conclusion of the Lord’s Supper, and
had but two of the brethren in the church who opposed him therein.
(These two seem to have made great complaint of the fact ‘ that many
of the honest hearers, who stayed to see the supper, sung with them.’
A terrible calamity certainly.) After the church had continued in this
practice about six years, they further consented to practise the same on
public thanksgiving days, and continued therein about fourteen years.
Even this, however, does not seem to have been continuously carried out,
and the grumbling few complained that on one occasion, ‘ when the
minister had ended his exercise, a hymn was given up to him, by whom
we know not (except it were by Mr Keach’s means), which he read and
sung and the people with him ; but this was not in the least by the
appointment of the church, but an imposition on them.’ In due time
by a regular act of the church, it was agreed to sing the praises of God
on every Lord’s Day. There were only about five or six persons that
dissented therefrom, but so far was Mr. Keach, or the church, from im-
posing on the consciences of those few that dissented (though
the church then consisted of some hundreds) that they agreed
to sing when prayer was concluded after the sermon, and if those
few who were not satisfied could not stay the time of singing, they
might freely go out, and the church would not be offended at them.
Notwithstanding the care and consideration, however, the malcontents
would not yield. They withdrew, and founded another church upon the
same principles, singing only excepted, so difficult was it to remove long-
standing prejudices.” The secession formed that right worthy and
well-beloved church which has for many years continued to meet in
the chapel in Maze Pond, until now it seeks another local habitation in
the Old Kent Road. It was some time before the Maze Pond friends
learned to sing, but it is needless to say that all in due time they became
as fond of making melody unto the Lord as the brethren from whom
they parted. There can be no doubt that the separation strengthened
the denomination by giving it two earnest churches instead of one, and
therefore we conclude that, however strange the immediate cause, it
was of the Lord. The two churches have lived on the happiest terms,
and have again and again accommodated each other, when either meet-
ing-house has been under repair. Happily this was the only division
which vexed the fellowship under Mr. Keach, though the Quakers at
one time, and the seventh-day Baptists at another, caused some trouble
and discussion. The pastor was a power in the church, and by the
weight of his mind and character directed it aright, so that troublers
found it expedient to carry out their mission in some less consolidated
community. He could also wax warm, and deliver his mind with


vehemence, and then it was somewhat dangerous to be his opponent.
Mr. Keach was not, however, apt to spend his time in contention, he
was a practical man, and trained his church to labour in the service of
the Lord. Several were by his means called into the Christian ministry,
his own son, Elias Keach, among them. He was mighty at home and
useful abroad. By his means other churches were founded and meeting-
houses erected ; he was in fact as a pillar and a brazen wall among the
Baptist churches of his day, and was in consequence deservedly had in
honour. We find his name among others convening the first assembly
of Particular Baptists, and as agreeing to the confession of faith which
was issued by that body. His name also appears at the foot of calls to
public fasts and thanksgivings, which were held by the denomination.
He was a leading spirit in the Baptist body.
“ Mr. Keach was of a very weak constitution, being often afflicted
with illness, and once to such a degree that he was given over by the
physicians ; and several of the ministers, and his relations, had taken
their leave of him as a dying man and past all hope of recovery ; but
the reverend Mr. Hanserd Knollys, seeing his friend and brother in
the gospel so near expiring, betook himself to prayer, and in a very
extraordinary manner begged that God would spare him, and add
unto his days the time he granted to his servant Hezekiah. As soon as
he had ended his prayer, he said, ‘ Brother Keach, I shall be in heaven
before you,’ and quickly after left him. So remarkable was the answer
of God to this good man’s prayer, that we cannot omit it; though it
may be discredited by some, there were many who could bear incon-
testible testimony to the fact. Mr. Keach recovered of that illness,
and lived just fifteen years afterwards ; and then it pleased God to
visit him with that short sickness which put an end to his days.” He
“fell on sleep ” July 16th, 1704, in the sixty-fourth year of his age,
and was buried at the Baptists’ burying ground in the Park, Southwark.
It was not a little singular that in after years the church over which
he so ably presided should pitch its tent so near the place where his
bones were laid, and New Park-street should appear in her annals as a
well-beloved name.
Here perhaps is the fittest place to insert “ The Solemn Covenant,”
to which all the members of the church subscribed in the days of Mr.
Keach. It must commend itself to the judgment of all candid Chris-
tians. Would to God that all our churches were mindful of the sacred
relationship which exists among Christians, and attended to the duties
arising out of it.
The Solemn Covenant of the Chuhch at its Constitution. We
■who desire to walk together in the fear of the Lord, do, through the assist-
ance of his Holy Spirit, profess our deep and serious humiliation for all our
transgressions. And we do solemnly, in the presence of God, of each other, in
the sense of our own unworthiness, give up ourselves to the Lord, in a church
state according to the apostolical constitution, that he may be our God, and we
may be his people, through the everlasting covenant of his free grace, in which
alone we hope to be accepted by him, through his blessed Son Jesus Christ,
whom we take to be our High Priest, to justify and sanctify us, and our Prophet
to teach us; and to be subject to him as our Law-giver, and the King of Saints ;
and to conform to all his holy laws and ordinances, for our growth, establish-
ment, and consolation ; that we may be as a holy spouse unto him, and serve


Lira in our generation, and wait for his second appearance, as our glorious
Bridegroom.
Being fully satisfied in the way of church-communion, and the truth of grace
in some good measure upon one another’s spirits, we do solemnly join ourselves
together in a holy union and fellowship, humbly submitting to the discipline of
the gospel, and all holy duties required of a people in such a spiritual relation.
1. We do promise and engage to walk in all holiness, godliness, humility, and
brotherly love, as much as in us lieth lo render our communion delightful to
God, comfortable to ourselves, and lovely to the rest of the Lord’s people.
2. We do promise to watch over each other’s conversations, and not to suffer
sin upon one another, so far as God shall discover it to us, or any of us ; and to
stir up one another to love and good works; to warn, rebuke, and admonish
one another with meekness, according to the rules left to us of Christ in that
behalf.
3. We do promise in an especial manner to pray for one another, and for the
glory and increase of this church, and for the presence of God in it, and the
pouring forth of his Spirit on it, and his protection over it to his glory.
4. We do promise to bear one another’s burdens, to cleave to one another,
and to have a fellow-feeling with one another, in all conditions both outward and’
inward, as God in his providence shall cast any of us into.
5. We do promise to bear with one another’s weaknesses, failings, and
infirmities, with much tenderness, not discovering them to any without the
Church, nor any within, unless according to Christ’s rule, and the order of
the gospel provided in that case.
6. We do promise to strive together for the truth of the gospel and purity
of God’s ways and ordinances, to avoid causes, and causers of division,
endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. Eph. iv. 3.
7. We do promise to meet together on Lord’s-days, and at other times, as
the Lord shall give us opportunities, to serve and glorify God in the way of his
worship, to edify one another, and to contrive the good of his church.
8. We do promise according to our ability (or as God shall bless us with the
good things of this world) to communicate to our pastor or minister, God
having ordained that they that preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
(And now can anything lay a greater obligation upon the conscience than this
covenant, what then is the sin of such who violate it ?)
These and all other gospel duties we humbly submit unto, promising and
purposing to perform, not in our own strength, being conscious of our own
weakness, but in the power and strength of the blessed God, whose we are, and
whom we desire to serve. To whom be glory now and for evermore. Amen.


CHAPTER III.—BENJAMIN STINTON.
HEN Mr. Reach was upon his death-bed he sent for
/SgafeSS) , <S§ his son-in-law, Benjamin Stinton, and solemnly
charged him to care for the church which he was
about, to leave, and especially urged him to accept
i the pastoral office should it be offered to him by the
brethren. Mr. Stinton had already for some years
helped his father-in-law in many ways, and therefore
he was no new and untried man. It is no small blessing when a
church can find her pastors in her own midst; the rule is to look
abroad, but perhaps if our home gifts were more encouraged the Holy
Spirit would cause our teachers to come forth more frequently from
among our own brethren. Still we cannot forget the proverb about a
prophet in his own country. When the church gave Mr. Stinton a
pressing invitation, he delayed a while, and gave himself space for
serious consideration ; but at length remembering the dying words of
his father-in-law, and feeling himself directed by the Spirit of God, he
gave himself up to the ministry, which he faithfully discharged for
14 years—namely, from 1704 to 1718.
Mr. Stinton had great natural gifts, but felt in need of more educa-
tion, and set himself to work to obtain it as soon as he was settled'
over the church. Thoroughly to be furnished for the great work before
him was his first endeavour. Crosby says of him : “He was a very
painful and laborious minister of the gospel, and though he had not
the advantage of an academical education, yet by his own industry,
under the assistance of the famous Mr. Ainsworth (author of the Latin
dictionary), after he had taken upon him the ministerial office, he
acquired a good degree of knowledge in the languages, and other useful
parts of literature, which added lustre to those natural endowments
which were very conspicuous in him.”
He will be best remembered for the zealous part which he took in
movements for the general good. He was the originator with others
of the Protestant Dissenters’ Charity School in Horselydown, at which
conscientious dissenters were able to obtain an education for their
children without their being compelled to attend the Established Church
and learn the Catechism. To assist in the maintenance of this school,
an evening lecture was established on the Lord’s-day at Mr. Stinton s
meeting-house, at which six ministers officiated in turns.
We find that Mr. Stinton and his church were largely interested in
the repair and rebuilding of a Baptisterion in Horselydown, to which


the various churches were able to bring their candidates for baptism,
and administer the ordinance comfortably and decorously. Very few
meeting-houses at that time possessed baptisteries of their own, and
as these places were usually small it was not easy to provide proper
vestries and robing-rooms. At the Common Baptistery every con-
venience could be provided for all the churches which chose to use it.
But the grand achievement of this pastorate was the establishment
of the Baptist Fund. Mr. Stinton was one of the chief originators
if not the first mover in the establishment of this fund, which has been
the means of untold benefit to the Baptist denomination. Its first
object is to make due provision for the honourable maintenance of poor
ministers, and to assist in training up others to succeed them in their
office. How great a need there was in the matter of ministerial poverty
is too clear from a resolution of the managers of the fund that none
were eligible to receive assistance who received more than £25 per
annum from their congregations. What true devotion must have fired
the breasts of men who could bear such penury for Christ’s sake!
It was time that such extreme poverty should not be allowed to exist
needlessly, and that sufferers should be generously assisted. To this end
certain churches subscribed a capital sum to form the basis of the fund :
Mr. Stinton’s church giving £l5O, and being therefore entitled to
send the pastor and three delegates to vote upon the distribution of
the moneys. The fund has now a large sum to expend annually, and
thereby helps struggling pastors, gives grants of books to students, and
spends an amount annually upon the education of young men for the
ministry. The fund is called The Particular Baptist Fund, as
being intended to aid Calvinistic rather than Arminian Baptists. This
was not at all to the mind of Stinton, who desired to have the fund
established for the benefit of all Baptists who held the great funda-
mentals of the gospel. Although himself a Calvinistic Baptist, he
thought it unlovely to divide the body with a hard and fast line, and
•unwise to open doors for constant dispute and disunion. Finding that
his views were not endorsed by the other brethren, he entered his protest,
and then proceeded to aid them to the utmost of his power in their
more limited design. He was not impracticable, and in this he far
surpassed certain pretentious Liberals of the present day, who will do
nothing if they may not attempt everything.
In the later days of Mr. Stinton, as the lease of the meeting-house in
Goat’s Yard was nearly run out, preparation was made for erecting a new
place of worship in Unicorn Yard.
Spending himself in various works of usefulness, Mr. Stinton worked
on till the 11th of February, 1718, when a sudden close was put to his
labours and his life. He was taken suddenly ill, and saying to his wife,
lam going , he laid himself down upon the bed, and expired in the
forty-third year of his life. He smiled on death, for the Lord smiled
on him. He was buried near his predecessor, in the Park, Southwark.


CHAPTER IV.—JOHN GILL.
tf||glg-|||||r£>HE loss of its pastor is always a serious matter to a
Baptist church, not only because it is deprived of the
services of a well-tried and faithful guide, but because
in the process of selecting a successor some of the
worst points of human nature are too apt to come to
the front. All may unite in the former pastor, but
where will they find another rallying point? So
many men, so many minds. All are not prepared to forego their
own predilections, some are ready to be litigious, and a few seize
the opportunity to thrust themselves into undue prominence. If they
would all wait upon the Lord for his guidance, and consent to follow it
when they have obtained it, the matter would move smoothly; but, alas, it
is not always so. In the present instance there came before the church
an excellent young man, whose after life proved that he was well quali-
fied for the pastorate, but either he was too young, being only twenty
or one-and-twenty years of age, or there were certain points in his
manner which were not pleasing to the older friends, and therefore he
was earnestly opposed. The deacons, with the exception of Mr. Thomas
Crosby, schoolmaster, and son-in-law of Keach, were resolved that
this young man, who was no other than John Gill from Kettering,
should not become the pastor. He found, however, warm and
numerous supporters, and when the question came to a vote, his
admirers claimed the majority, and in all probability their claim
was correct, for the other party declined a scrutiny of the votes,
and also raised the question of the women’s voting, declaring, what was
no doubt true, that apart from the female vote John Gill was in the
minority. The end of the difference was that about half the church
withdrew from the chapel in Goat Yard, and met in Mr. Crosby’s school-
room, claiming to be the old church, wdiile another portion remained in
the chapel, and also maintained that they were the original church.
The question is now of small consequence, if it ever had any
importance, for the company who rejected Gill, after selecting an
excellent preacher, and prospering for many years, met with a
chequered experience, and at length ceased to exist. In all proba-
bility the division promoted the growth of the cause of Christ, and
whatever unhappy circumstances marred it for awhile, both parties
acted conscientiously, and in a very short time were perfectly reconciled
to each other. Mr. Gill’s people did not long worship in Crosby’s
school-room, but as the other friends were moving out and erecting


another meeting-house in Unicorn Yard, they came back to the old
building in Goat Yard, and found themselves very much at home.
Crosby, however, quarrelled with the pastor and left him, and with
some others of his own family went to the other community in Unicorn
Yard. We suspect that Mr. Gill had preached a little too dogmatically
JOHN GILL.
for the schoolmaster, and proved himself to be a more thorough-
going Calvinist, and a more rigid doctrinalist than the brother-in-
law of Stinton quite approved. It was not very wonderful that he
should turn against the man of his choice, for it has happened times


without number, that men who are warm partisans are apt to become
fierce opponents when their man does not prove to be subservient, and
will not be moulded at their will. The friend is apt to assume the airs
of a patron, and talk about ingratitude, but with men like John Gill
this would never succeed.
As Dr. Gill’s ministry extended over no less a period than fifty-one
years, reaching from 1720 to 1771, and as he proved himself to be a
true master in Israel, we shall need more than the usual space in which
to describe him. His entire ministry was crowned with more than
ordinary success, and he was by far the greatest scholar the church
had yet chosen, but he cannot be regarded as so great a soul-winner
as Keach had been, neither was the church at any time so
numerous under his ministry as under that of Keach. His method of
address to sinners, in which for many years a large class of preachers
followed him, was not likely to be largely useful. He cramped
himself, and was therefore straitened where, there was no scriptural
reason for being so. He does not appear to have had the public spirit
of Stinton, though he had a far larger share of influence in the
churches, and was indeed a sort of archbishop over a certain section.
The ordination discourses and funeral sermons which he preached must
have amounted to a very large number : it seemed as if no Particular
Baptist minister could be properly inducted or interred without Dr.
Gill’s officiating. We shall, however, be more likely to give our readers
an idea of this truly great man if we set forth such details of his life as
we can gather.
John Gill was born at Kettering, in Northamptonshire, November
23, 1697. His father, Edward Gill, first became a member of the
Dissenting congregation in that place, consisting then of Presbyterians,
Independents, and Baptists. Besides their pastor, they had a teaching
elder of the Baptist denomination, Mr. William Wallis, who was the
administrator of baptism, by immersion, to such persons among them
as desired it; but at length the baptized believers having been rendered
uncomfortable in their communion, by some particular persons, they
were obliged to separate, with Mr. William Wallis, their teacher, and
formed themselves into a distinct church of the Particular Baptist de-
nomination. Among the number was Mr. Edward Gill, who in due
time was chosen to the office of deacon among them.
Young John Gill, with the dawn of reason, discovered a fine capacity
for learning; and, being soon out of the reach of common teachers,
he was very early sent to the grammar-school in the town, which he
attended with uncommon diligence and unwearied application, quickly
surpassing those of his own age, and others who were considerably his
seniors. Here he continued till he was eleven years old. During this
time, notwithstanding the tedious manner in which grammatical know-
ledge was then conveyed, besides going through the common school
books, he mastered the principal Latin classics, and made such a pro-
ficiency in the Greek as obtained for him marks of distinction from
several of the neighbouring clergy, who were good enough occasionally
to examine and encourage his progress, when they met him at a book-
seller’s shop in the town, which he constantly attended on market days,
when only it was opened. Here he so regularly attended, for the sake


of consulting different authors, that it became the usual asseveration,
with the people of the neighbourhood, when speaking of anything they
considered certain —“it is as sure,” said they, “as that John Gill is in
the bookseller’s shop.” And as the same studious disposition attended
him through life, so did nearly the same remark : those who knew him
usually employing this mode of affirmation, “as surely as Dr. Gill is in
his study.”
As the precocious talents of young Gill were also attended with early
piety, he was baptized and received into the church in Kettering in his
nineteenth year, and, at the request of the church, very soon began to
preach among them. This led to his removing to Higham Ferrers, a
small borough town in Northamptonshire, where he lived near a minister
of learning who helped him in his studies. His name appears at this
time upon the books of the Baptist Fund as receiving £l6 during
his twentieth and twenty-first years. Little did the church in Goat’s
Yard know when it subscribed to the fund, that one of its future eminent
pastors would be an early recipient of its bounty. At Higham Ferrers
Gill married, but did not long continue in the place, returning to reside
in Kettering.
A person who was present when John Gill preached his very first
sermon at Kettering, also heard him deliver his last in London, more
than fifty years after. After his death she joined the church over
which he had presided, relating, at some length, a truly interesting
experience, which gave universal pleasure to all who heard it. Her
name was Mary Bailey, and it is to be hoped that none will imitate
her by postponing the confession of their faith in Jesus for so long a
time. She lived half a century in disobedience to her Lord, and even
when she avowed his name it must have caused her deep regret that
she had lingered so long in neglect of the Redeemer’s ordinance.
In the beginning of the year 1719, the church at Horsleydown
invited him to preach with a view to the pastorate. As we have
already seen, there was a determined opposition to him in about one
half of the church. The matter was referred to the club of ministers
meeting at the Hanover Coffee-house, and they gave the absurd
advice that the two parties should each hear their own man turn
about till they could agree. Common sense came to the rescue, and
this sort of religious duel never came off. The friends with far greater
wisdom divided. John Gill’s friends secured the old meeting-house
for the term of forty years, and he was ordained March 22, 1720.
Little did the friends dream what sort of man they had thus chosen
to be their teacher ; but had they known it they would have rejoiced
that a man of such vast erudition, such indefatigable industry, such
sound judgment, and such sterling honesty, had come among them.
He was to be more mighty with his pen than Keach, and to make a
deeper impression upon his age, though perhaps with the tongue he
was less powerful than his eminent predecessor. Early in his ministry
he had to take up the cudgels for Baptist views against a Paedobaptist
preacher of Rowel, near Kettering, and he did so in a manner worthy
of that eulogium which Toplady passed upon him in reference to other
controversies, when he compared him to Marlborough, and declared
that he never fought a battle without winning it.


Mr. Gill, being settled in London, became more intimately acquainted
with that worthy minister of the gospel, Mr. John Skepp, pastor of the
Baptist church at Cripplegate. This gentleman, though he had not a
liberal education, yet, after he came into the ministry, through great
diligence acquired a large acquaintance with the Hebrew tongue. As
Mr. Gill had previously taken great delight in the Hebrew, his conver-
sation with this worthy minister rekindled a flame of fervent desire to
obtain a more extensive knowledge of it, and especially of Rabbinical
learning. Mr. Skepp dying a year or two after, Mr. Gill purchased
most ot his Hebrew works, the Baptist Fund making him a grant of
£l7 10s. for this purpose. Having obtained the books, he went to
work with great eagerness, reading the Targums and ancient commen-
taries, and in a course of between twenty and thirty years’ acquaint-
ance with these writings he collected a large number of learned
observations. Having also, in this time, gone through certain books
or the Old Testament and almost the whole of the New Testament, by
way. of Exposition, in the course of his ministry, he put all the exposi-
tory, critical, and illustrative parts together, and in the year 1745
issued proposals for publishing his “ Exposition of the whole New Testa-
ment, ’in three volumes folio. The work meeting due encouragement,
it was put to press the same year, and was finished, the first volume ,
in 1746, the second in 1747, and the third in 1748. Towards the close
of the publication of this w r ork, in 1748, Mr. Gill received a diploma
from Marischal College, Aberdeen, creating him Doctor in Divinity
on account of his knowledge of the Scriptures, of the Oriental lan-
. guages and of Jewish antiquities. When his deacons in London
congratulated him on the respect which had been shown him, he thanked
them, pleasantly adding, I neither thought it, nor bought it, nor sought it.
The ministry of Mr. Gill being acceptable not only to his own people
but to many persons of different denominations, several gentle-
men proposed among themselves to set up a week-day lecture, that
they might have an opportunity of hearing him. Accordingly they
formed themselves into a society, and agreed to have a lecture on
>\ ednesday evenings, in Great Eastcheap, and set on foot a subscription
to support it. Upon their invitation Mr. Gill undertook the lectureship.
He opened it in the year 1729, with a discourse or two on Psalm Ixxi. 16,
I will go in the strength of the Lord God : I will make mention of
thy righteousness, even of thine only.” Through divine grace
he was enabled to abide by this resolution to the edification of
many, preaching in Great Eastcheap for more than twenty-six years,
and only relinquished the lecture when the infirmities of years were
telling upon him, and he felt a great desire to give all his time to the
completion of his great expository w r orks.
If it be enquired how he distributed his time, and whether he
indulged himself in any relaxation, we are able to reply. When the
doctor was asked by Mr. Ryland how it was that he had performed
such vast labours, he answered, it was not done by very early rising
nor by sitting up late—the latter he was confident must be injurious to
any student, and not helpful. The truth is, he rose as soon as it was
hght m the winter, and usually before six in the summer, in the last
pait ot his life not quite so early. He breakfasted constantly in his
4


study and always on chocolate, but came down with his family to
dinner and carved for them. Through the latter years of his life he
seldom went into his study after tea, unless about an hour in summer,
but sat below reading some book, or correcting his sheets as they weie
issuing from the press, and with some, of these he had care enough,
partlv'caused by his own indistinct autography, for at last he wrote a
very small and 7 illegible hand, and partly by the inattention or m-
competency of the compositors, from whom we are certain he has been
under the necessity of getting six or seven revises sheet < especis y
of such sheets as contained learned quotations. (Alas . in all ages
compositors and authors have been a mutual plague ! We have no doubt
that in Gill’s case the workmen were more sinned against than sinning .
if his writing was small and illegible, who wonders that compositors
W “fwaViever distinguished for the length or frequency of his
pastoral visits, and in this he is not an example. Yet probably his time
wag more profitable to the church of God m the study than it could
have been had he spent it in going from door to door. .

In the course of his ministry he had some weak, some unmrthy and
some very wicked persons to deal with. To the feeble of the nock
he was an affectionate friend and father. He readily bore with then
weaknesses failings, and infirmities, and particularly when he saw
thev were sincerely on the Lord’s side. A godly woman'visited him
one day in great trouble, about the singing ; for the clerk, in about
three years, S had introduced two new tunes. Eot that he was a
famous 7 singer, or able to conduct a great variety of song, but he
did his best. The young people were pleased with tunes ; but
the good woman could not bear the innovation. The Doctor, alter
natientJy listening, asked her whether she understood singing?
No she 7 said. “ What ! can’t you sing ? ” No, she was no singer
nor her aeed father before her. And though they had had about
<) hundred’ years between them to learn the Old Hundredth tune,
they could not sing it, nor any other turn. The doctor did not hurt her
feelings by telling her that people who did not unders and singing
werXL who g should eoml,lain ; but he meekly said •< Sister wha
tunes should you like us to sing? “Why, Sir she tophed 1
should very much like David s tunes. Well, said he, if jou wi
?3 tunes for us, we can then try to sing them ” Such weak
good people may be found among all denominations of Christians.
k Dr Gill was sometimes accosted by rude people, even in Ins own
congregation. A cynical old man, who we would charitably hope was


a little touched in the head, had taken an antipathy against
some of his minister’s tenets, oftener than once had grinned contempt
at him from the gallery. Then he tried another method of annoy-
ance, and would meet him at the foot of the pulpit-stairs, and ask,
“ Is this preaching ? ” repeating his question, “ Is this preaching ? ”
The insolence at first met with no answer from the preacher, but, it
seems, he determined not to be often treated in this manner. Not long
after, the said churl, planting himself again in the same position,
expressed his contempt somewhat louder. “Is this the great Doctor
Gill? ” The Doctor, immediately, addressed him with the full strength of
his voice, and looking him in the face, and pointing him to the pulpit,
said, “Go up and do better—go up and do better .” This was answering
a fool according to his folly ; and the reply afforded gratification to all
who heard it.
All the stories told of Dr. Gill are somewhat grim. He could not come
down to the level of men and women in the common order so far as to

be jocose, and when he attempted to do so, he looked like Hercules
with the distaff, or Goliath threading a needle. When he verged upon
the humorous the jokes were ponderous and overwhelming, burying
his adversary as well as crushing him. It is said that a garrulous
dame once called upon him to find fault with the excessive length
of his white bands. “ Well, well,” said the doctor, “ what do you
think is the right length ? Take them and make them as long or as
short as you like.” The lady expressed her delight; she was sure that
her dear pastor would grant her request, and therefore she had brought her
scissors with her and would do the trimming at once. Accordingly snip,
snip, and the thing was done and the bibs returned. “ Now,” said the
Doctor, “my good sister, you must do me a good turn also.” “Yes,
that I will, Doctor. What can it be ? ” “ Well—you have something
about you which is a deal too long, and causes me no end of trouble,
and I should like to see it shorter.” “ Indeed, dear sir, I will not


hesitate,” said the dame, “ what is it, here are the scissors, use them as
you please.” “ Come then,” said the pastor, “ good sister, put out your
tongue .” We have often pictured him sitting in the old chair which is
preserved in our vestry, and thus quietly rebuking the gossip.
•The comparative asperity of his manner was probably the result of
his secluded habits and also of that sturdy firmness of mind which in
other directions revealed itself so admirably. When he was once
warned that the publication of a certain book would lose him manv
supporters and reduce his income, he did not hesitate for a moment, but
replied, “Do not tell me of losing. I value nothing in comparison with
Gospel truth. lam not afraid to he poor.”
He had, however, a warm heart beneath his stern exterior, and was
full of tenderness, especially in the domestic circle. We read that he
went down to Kettering every year to spend a few days with his mother,
so long as she lived, and when the news of her death reached him he
laid down his pipe and never smoked again. His old country friends were
always welcome at his house, and in their society he would seem to have
unbent far more than one would have expected. With Mr. Clayton, of
Steventon, and other plain men, he would be much at home, and they
made very free with him. When this friend once came to London the
doctor said, “ Brother Clayton, what have you been, about ? They tell
me that you have been expounding the Revelations. A man who enters
upon that work should first have some acquaintance with history, the
prophecies in general, and many other things ! ” “Why, doctor,” said
Mr. Clayton, “I did as well as I could, and you can’t do any better.”
Such simplicity tickled the doctor amazingly, and it was commonly said
that he laughed more heartily that part of the year when Mr. Clayton
was in town than he did all the year besides.
In the year 1752 I)r. Gill had a very memorable escape from
being killed in his study. On March the 15th, in the morning, there
was a violent hurricane, which much damaged many houses both in
London and Westminster. Soon after he had left his study, to go to
preach, a stack of chimneys fell through the roof into his study,
breaking his writing table to pieces, and must have killed him had the
fall happened a little sooner. Seriously noticing this remarkable pre-
servation to a friend who had some time before repeated a saving of
I)r. Halley, the great astronomer, “ That great study prolonged a man’s
life, by keeping him out of harm’s way ”; he said, “ What becomes of
Dr. Halley s words now, since a man may come to danger and harm in
his own closet, as well as on the highway, if not protected by the special
care of God's providence ? ”
In 1757, the church under his care erected a new meeting-house for
him in Carter Lane, St. Olave’s Street, near London Bridge, Southwark ;
which he opened October 9, preaching two sermons on Exodus xx. 24.
I hese he afterwards printed, entitling them “ Attendance in places of
religious worship, where the Divine name is recorded, encouraged.” In
one of these discourses is this paragraph :—“ As we have now opened a
new piace ol worship, we enter upon it, recording the name ofthe Lord, by
preaching the doctrines of the grace of God, and of free and full salva-
tion ay Jesus Christ; and by the administration of gospel ordinances,
as triey have been delivered to us. AVhat doctrines may be taught in


this place, after I am gone, is not for me to know ; but, as for my own
part, lamat a point; lam determined, and have been long ago, what
to make the subject of my ministry. It is now upwards of forty years
since I entered into the arduous work, and the first sermon I ever
preached was from those words of the apostle : ‘ For lam determined
not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ', and him crucified .’
Through the grace of God, I have been enabled, in some good measure,
to abide by the same resolution hitherto, as many of you here are my
witnesses ; and I hope, through Divine assistance, I ever shall, as long
as lam in this tabernacle, and engaged in such a work. lam not afraid
of the reproaches of men; I have been inured to these, from my
youth upwards ; none of these things move me."
Our view of Carter Lane Chapel will not fascinate the reader ; we
have had to take it from a model in the possession of a former member
of the church. We trust the building was not so ugly as our drawing.
CARTER LANE CHAPEL
In the - Doctor’s later years the congregations were sparse and the
membership seriously declined. He was himself only able to preach
once on the Sabbath, and living in a rural retreat in Camberwell, he
could do but little in the way of overseeing the church. It was thought
desirable that some younger minister should be found to act as co-pastor.
To this the Doctor gave a very decided answer in the negative, asserting
“ that Christ gives pastors is certain, but that he gives co-pastors is not
so certain.” He even went the length of comparing a church with a co-
pastor to a woman who should marry another man while her first
husband lived, and call him a co-husband. In view of the many dis-
agreements and unhappinesses resulting from co-pastorships, we feel
half inclined to admire the Doctor’s refusal; and remembering what sort
of man he was, we question if a co-pastor would have worked happily
with him, but his arguments against the proposition were preposterous,


and in our own instance, in the selfsame church, two brothers have
worked together for years with the utmost harmony, and nothing has
occurred to make us fear that the position of aifairs is displeasing to
the great Head of the church. Great men are not always wise. How-
ever, by his stern repudiation of any division of his authority the old
gentleman held the reins of power till the age of seventy-four, although
the young people gradually dropped off and the church barely numbered
150 members.
The intense admiration and love of his flock is evinced by the letter
sent to him in reply to his refusal to have an assistant. They defer at
once to this judgment, and declare that they never wished to do more
than consult him with the utmost deference, and then they conclude by
saying, “We greatly fear that you apprehend an abatement in our
aifection toward you. That we are not conscious of, we think it
impossible that our love should be easily removed from him who has
instrumentally been made so useful to our souls; but we trust our
•hearts are knit as the heart of one man toward you, as the servant of
Christ, and as our father in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. Another
grieving circumstance is, that if the church is willing, you seem
inclined to resign your office as pastor. This expression is extremely
alarming to us, and is what can by no means find a place in our
thoughts, it being our fixed desire and continual prayer, that you may
live and die in that endeared relation. We say with united voice,
How can a father give up his children, or affectionate children their
father ? Dear Sir, we beseech you not to cast us off, but bear us upon
your heart and spiritual affections all your days, and let us be remem-
bered to God through your prayers, and who knows but the Lord
may visit us again and make us to break forth on the right hand and
on the left ?” This was signed by all the brethren.
In a few weeks the venerable divine became too feeble for pulpit
service and confined himself to his study and the writing-desk,
and by-and-by found that he must lie down to rest, for his day’s work
was done. He died as he had lived, in a calm, quiet manner, resting
on that rich sovereign grace which it had been his joy to preach.
To his dear relative, the Rev. John Gill, of St. Albans, he thus
expressed himself: “ I depend wholly and alone upon the free,
sovereign, eternal, unchangeable, love of God, the firm and everlasting
covenant of grace, and my interest in the persons of the Trinity, for
my whole salvation ; and not upon any righteousness of my own;
nor upon anything done in me, or done by me, under the influences of
the Holy Spirit.”
Nearly in the same words he expressed himself to others. To
one he said, “ I have nothing to make me uneasy,” and then repeated
the following lines from Dr. Watts, in honour of the adored Redeemer:—
“ He raised me from the deeps of sin,
The gates of gaping hell,
And fix’d my standing more secure,
Than ’tv?as before I fell.”
The last words he was heard to speak were, “0 my Father, my
Father”! He died at Camberwell, October 14, 1771, and was


buried in Bunhill Fields. His eyesight had been preserved to him
so that he could read small print by candle-light even to the
last, and he never used glasses. His was a mind and frame of singular
vigour, and he died before failing sight, either mental or physical,
rendered him unfit for service: in this as highly favoured as he had
been in most other respects. He was one of the most learned men that
the Baptist denomination has ever produced. His great work, “ The
Exposition of the Old and New Testament ,’’ is still held in the highest
esteem even by those whose sentiments widely differ from the author’s.
His “Body of Divinity ” is also a masterly condensation of doctrinal and
practical theologv, and his “ Cause of God and Truth ” is highly esteemed
by many. The system of theology with which many identify his name has
chilled many churches to their very soul, for it has led them to omit the
free invitations of the gospel, and to deny that it is the duty of sinners
to believe in Jesus : but for this Dr. Gill must not be altogether held
responsible, for a candid reader of his commentary will soon perceive
in it expressions altogether out of accord with such a narrow system;
and it is well known that when he was dealing with practical godli-
ness he was so bold in his utterances that the devotees of Hyper-
Calvinism could not endure him. “ Well, Sir,” said one of these, “if
I had not been told that it was the great Dr. Gill who preached, I
should have said I had heard an Arminian.”
DR. GILL’S PULPIT.
The reader may perhaps like to look at Gill’s pulpit. It has for
years been used by the young men of the Pastors’ College when
preaching before their fellow-students. Ought they not to be sound ?


CHAPTER V.—JOHN RIPPON, D.D.
mighty commentator having been followed to his
sg grave by his attached church and a great company of
gj ministers and Christian people, among whom he had
SIHISKP? b ? en re g arded as a great man and a prince in Israel,
bis . church began to look around for a successor.
This time as in the case of Dr. Gill there was trouble
in store, for there was division of opinion. Some,
no doubt, as true Gillites, looked only for a solid divine, sound in
doctrine, who would supply the older saints with spiritual food, while
another party had an eye to the growth of the church, and to the securing
to the flock the younger members of their families. They were agreed
that they would write to Bristol for a probationer, and Mr. John
Rippon was sent to them. He was a youth ot some twenty summers,
of a vivacious temperament, quick and bold. The older members
judged him to be too young, and too flighty ; they even accused him
of having gone up the pulpit stairs two steps at a time on some
occasion when he was hurried, —a grave offence for which the con-
demnation could hardly be too severe. He was only a young man, and
came from an academy, and this alone was enough to make the sounder
and older members afraid of him. He preached for a lengthened time
on probation, and finally some forty persons withdrew because
they could not agree with the enthusiastic vote by which the
majority of the people elected him.
John Rippon modestly expressed his wonder that even more had not
been dissatisfied, and his surprise that so large a number were agreed
to call him to the pastorate. In the spirit of forbearance and
brotherly love he proposed that, as these friends were seceding for
conscience sake, and intended to form themselves into another church
they should be lovingly dismissed with prayer and God-speed, and that’
as a token of fraternal love, they should be assisted to build a meeting-
house for their own convenience, and the sum of £3OO should be
voted to them when their church was formed and their meeting-house
erected. The promise was redeemed, and Mr. Rippon took part in the
ordination service of the first minister. This was well done. Such a
course was sure to secure the blessing of God. The church in Dean
Stieet thus became another offshoot from the parent stem, and with vary-
ing conditions it remains to this day as the church in Trinity Street,
Borough. It is somewhat remarkable as illustrating the perversity of
human judgment that the seceding friends who objected to Rippon’s


youth elected for their pastor Mr. William Button who was \
still, being only nineteen years of age. His father, however ' 7n^er
deacon under l)r. Gill, and therefore no doubt the worthy voutlf a
regarded with all the more tenderness ; nor did he disappoint
hopes of his friends, for he laboured on for more than forty years w'
JOHN RIPPON IN HIS YOUTH.
the utmost acceptance. The friends who remained with young John
tippon had no reason to regret their choice : the tide of prosperity
set in and continued for half a century, and the church again came to
the trout m denominational affairs. The chapel in Carter Lane was
enlarged, and various agencies and societies set in motion ; there was,


in fact a real revival of religion in the church, though it was of that
quiet style which became a Baptist church of the straiter sort.
Kip >on was rather clever than profound ; his talents were far inferior
tc ‘rose of Gill, but he had more tact, and so turned his gifts to the
- ' dtest possible account. He said many smart and witty things, and
xiis preaching was always lively, affectionate, and impressive. He was
popular in the best sense of the term, —beloved at home, respected
abroad, and useful everywhere. Many souls were won to Jesus by his
teaching, and out of these a remarkable number became themselves
ministers of the gospel. The church-book abounds with records of
brethren preaching before the church, as the . custom was in those
days.
In order to provide the denomination with information as to its own
affairs, he projected the “ Baptist Register ,” and edited it for several years.
Its general tone and spirit have been well brought out in a sketch by
Mr. Goadby in his “Bye-paths of Baptist History.” “At first sight the
contents of the Register do not promise modem readers very dainty fare ;
but on a further and more careful examination, especially in the long
foot-notes given in some of the volumes, one discovers many toothsome
morsels. A few of these we now give. It will be seen, that while Dr.
Rippon and his friends were animated by the very laudable desire of
presenting an accurate account of the Baptist denomination during the
latter half of the last century, they often indulged in the freest and
quaintest criticisms on ministers who were then living.
“ Of Willingham, Cambs, we are told, ‘ The good man (John Rootham,
the minister) has been much tried with an asthmatical complaint and
other disorders, so that he seldom enjoys a day’s health. But he has a
considerable congregation, and about forty members.’ Nicholas Gillard,
the pastor of Collimpton, Devon, ‘is eighty. His people say that his
path is like that of the just, shining more and more unto the perfect
day.’ Daniel Sprague, the minister of Tiverton, enjoys a singularly
robust constitution. ‘He says that preaching fourteen or fifteen sermons
a week strengthens his body, and invigorates his soul.’ It is reported of
John Rippon, sen., of Upottery, ‘that he is a man of the sweetest
temper; and that good judges say he preaches better and better.’ The
minister of Coventry, John Butterworth, we learn, ‘went to London to
collect money in payment of the debt on the meeting-house, and bore
the fatigue as well as could be expected.’
“There are two or three curious morsels from Yorkshire. The first
relates to the minister at Bradford. ‘ The aged father Crabtree is now
getting feeble, and sometimes sits down once or twice in the course of
his sermon ; but great savour attends his prayers and all his discourses,
and he preaches with as much zeal and animation as ever.’ The second
refers to Mr. James Shuttleworth, of Coerling Hill. We are told, with,
the most charming frankness, that this minister ‘is a man of weak
constitution, with a little wife and ten children, many of them very
small!' A friend also writes of Mr. William Hague, the minister of
Scarborough : ‘ Our beloved pastor is advancing in years, and almost
-blind. He is a zealous, faithful labourer in this corner of Christ’s vine-
yard. He has a wife and three children at home. His last year’s
salary amounted to £3O, which is the most we ever raised him,’


“ Of the other ministers who are singled out for special remark, two
instances must suffice. The Rev. W. Clarke, of Exeter, is spoken of as
a man remarkable for prudence and sweetness of temper. Surely Mr.
Clarke’s modesty must have suffered some shock when his virtues were
thus paraded before the whole denomination. But the most singular
comment is on the Rev. Thomas Mabbott, of Bigglesivade, Beds. ‘As
a preacher he ivas much too loud and too long, a habit rarely attended
with such desirable effects as ministers are ready to expect; but it is
ruinous to themselves, and often creates a disgust in the minds of even
a serious audience, and mars the whole service.’ Poor Mr. Mabbott!
he had gone to his rest before this public lecturing on his defects could
produce either pain or profit.
“ There are two items about deacons that are sufficiently quaint to merit
quoting. One refers to Mr. John Hall, a deacon of the church at
Hamsterly, Devon. ‘He was a man never taken by surprise. How-
ever adverse any dispensation, he never said more than, “It might
have been worse” It was long remembered of him that when he had a
crop of wheat so shaken by the wind that there was scarcely a grain of
it left in the ear, upon taking hold of some, he said to the reapers,
“ Well, it might have been worse. Here is good straw left for which wo
ought to be thankful ! ” ’ Verily, Mr. Hall was an exceptional farmer,
to say the very least. The other is recorded of Mr. Davey, a deacon
of Chard. ‘He had,’ so we are told, with imperturbable gravity,
‘ nine children ; and at, or near the birth of each child he was
favoured with an additional cow to his worldly substance ; so that he had
as many cows as children, and no more !’
“ The man who could pen these quaint and curious details was not
destitute of humour; and one cannot but regret that only four volumes
of the Register appeared. We have thereby lost many side glimpses,
and some sad ones also, of the Baptist ministers and people of the close
of the Eighteenth Century.”
Dr. Rippon also occupied himself with preparing a history of the
worthies who lie buried in Bunhill Fields, and a number of subscribers’
names were received, but the work never reached the press. Rippon
was a busy man, and though neither a scholar nor an original thinker,
his pen was seldom idle and himself never.
He will be best known as having prepared the first really good selec-
tion of hymns for dissenting congregations. Although a Baptist
collection it was extensively used with Dr. Watts’ among both classes
of Congregationalists. This work was an estate to its author,
and he is said to have been more than sufficiently eager to push its
sale. One thing we know, his presents of nicely bound copies must
have been pretty frequent, for we have seen several greatly prized
by their aged owners, who have showed them to us, with the remark, “ the
dear old doctor gave me that himself.”
The happy eccentricity of the doctor’s character may be illustrated
by a little incident in connection with royalty. He was deputed to
read an address from the dissenters to George 111., congratulating him
upon recovery from sickness. The doctor read on with his usual clear
utterance, till coming to a passage in which there was special reference
to the goodness of God, he paused and said, “Please, your majesty, we


will read that again,” and then proceeded with his usual cool dignity to
repeat the sentence with emphasis. No other man in the deputation
would have thought of doing such a thing, but from Rippon it came so
naturally that no one censured him, or if they did it would have had no
effect upon him. He was asked why he did not attend more denomi-
national meetings and take the lead, “ Why,” said he, “ I see the Dover
coach go by my house every morning, and I notice that the leaders get
most lashed.” A somewhat inglorious argument for keeping in the
rear.
In his later days Rippon was evidently in very comfortable circum-
stances, for we have often heard mention of his carriage and pair, or
rather “glass coach and two horses.” His congregation was one of
the wealthiest wjthin the pale of nonconformity, and always ready to aid
the various societies which sprang up, especially the Baptist Foreign
Mission, and a certain Baptist Itinerant Society, which we suppose to
have represented the Baptist Home Mission. The Pastor occupied no
mean position in the church, but ruled with dignity and discretion—
perhaps ruled a little too much. “ How is it, Doctor, that your church
is always so peaceful ? ” said a much-tried brother minister. “ Well,
friend,” said Rippon, “you see, we don’t call a church-meeting to consult
about buying a new broom every time we want one, and we don’t entreat
every noisy member to make a speech about the price of the soap the
floors are scrubbed with.” In many of our smaller churches a want of
common sense is very manifest in the management, and trouble is
invited by the foolish methods of procedure.
Dr. Rippon once said he had some of the best people in His Majesty’s
dominions in his church, and he used to add with a nod—“ and some of the
worst." Some of the latter class seem to have got into office at one time,
for they were evidently a hindrance rather than a help to the good man,
though from his independent mode of doing things the hindrance did
not much affect him. As well as we can remember the story of his
founding the almshouses and schools in 1803, it runs as follows : The
Doctor urges upon the deacons the necessity of such institutions ; they
do not see the urgency thereof; he pleads again, but like the deaf adder
they are not to be charmed, charm he never so wisely. “ The expense
will be enormous, and the money cannot be raised,” this was the un-
ceasing croak of the prudent officers. At length the Pastor says, “ The
money can be raised, and shall be. Why, if I don’t go out next Monday
and collect £SOO before the evening meeting, I’ll drop the proposal; but
while I am sure the people will take up the matter heartily I will not
be held back by you.” Disputes in this case were urged in very plain
language, but with no degree of bitterness, for the parties knew each
other, and had too much mutual respect to make their relationships in
the church depend upon a.point of difference. All were agreed to put
the Doctor to the test, and challenged him to produce the £SOO next
Monday, or cease to importune about almshouses. The worthy slow-
coaches were up to time on the appointed evening, and the Doctor soon
arrived. “ Well, brethren,” said he, “ I have succeeded in collecting
£3O0 —that is most encouraging, is it not ? ” “ But,” said two or three
of them at once in a hurry, “you said you would get £SOO or drop the
matter, and we mean to keep you to your word.” “By all means,” said


he, “ and I mean to keep my word, too, for there is £BOO which the
friends gave me almost without asking, and the rest is nearly all
promised.” The prudent officials were taken aback, but recovering
themselves, they expressed their great pleasure, and would be ready to
meet the pastor at any time and arrange for the expending of the funds.
“No, no, my brethren,” said the Doctor, “ I shall not need your services.
You have opposed me all along, and now I have doue the work without
you, you want to have your say in it to hinder me still ; but neither
you nor any other deacons shall plague a minister about this business.
So, brethren, you can attend to something else.” Accordingly, the old
trust deed of the almshouses had a clause to the eifect, that the pastor
shall elect the pensioners, “no deacon interfering .” The present minister
had great pleasure in inducing the Charity Commissioners to expunge
this clause, and give the pastor and deacons unitedly the power to
select the objects of the charity.
Dr. Rippon continued in the pastorate from 1773 to 1836, a period
of 63 years. He outlived his usefulness, and it was a wonderful
instance of divine care over the church that the old gentleman did not
do it serious injury. He retained the will to govern after the capacity
was gone, and he held his power over the pulpit though unable to
occupy it to profit. Supplies who came to preach for him were not
always allowed to officiate, and when they did, the old minister’s
remarks from his pew were frequently more quaint than agreeable. It
is not an unqualified blessing to live to be 85. During the last few
months Mr. Charles Room, with the Doctor’s full approbation, acted
as his assistant, but he resigned upon the decease of Dr. Rippon. He
left with the esteem and good wishes of the church, and afterwards
exercised a useful ministry at Portsea.
In 1830, six years before Dr. Rippon’s death, the old sanctuary in
Carter Lane was closed to be pulled down for making the approaches to
the present London Bridge. Due compensation was given, but a
chapel could not be built in a day, and, therefore, for three years the
church was without a home and had to be indebted to the hospitality of
other congregations. After so long a time for choice, the good deacons
ought to have pitched upon a better site for the new edifice; but it is not
hardly judging them when we say that they could not have discovered
a worse position. If they had taken thirty years to look about them
with the design of burying the church alive they could not have suc-
ceeded better. New Park Street is a lowlying sort of lane close to the
bank of the river Thames, near the enormous breweries of Messrs.
Barclay and Perkins, th.e vinegar factories of Mr. Potts, and several
large boiler works. The nearest way to it from the City was over
Southwark bridge, with a toll to pay. No cabs could be had within
about half-a-mile of the place, and the region was dim, dirty, and
destitute, and frequently flooded by the river at high tides. Here,
liowever, the new chapel must be built because the ground was a cheap
freehold, and the authorities were destitute of enterprise, and would
not spend a penny more than the amount in hand. That God in infinite
mercy forbade the extinction of the church is no mitigation of the
shortsightedness which thrust a respectable community of Christians
into an out-of-the-way position, far more suitable for a tallow-melter s


than a meeting-house. The chapel, however, was a neat, handsome,
commodious, well-built edifice, and was regarded as one of the best
Baptist chapels in London.
NEW PARK STREET CHAPEL.
Dr. Itippon was present at the opening of the new house in 1833,
but it was very evident that, having now found a place to meet in, the
next step must be to find a minister to preside over the. congregation.
This was no easy task, for the old gentleman, though still revered and
loved, was difficult to manage in such matters. Happily, however,
the deacons were supremely judicious, and having kept the interest
out of all rash expenditure they also preserved it from all hasty
action, and tided over affairs till the worn-out pastor passed away to
his rest, and with due funereal honours was laid in that Campo Santa
of Nonconformists—the cemetery of Bunhill Fields, of which it had
been his ambition to become the historian and chronicler.
There are still some in the church who cherish his memory with
affectionate and well-deserved reverence, and there are thousands in
heaven who were led first to love the Saviour by his earnest exhorta-
tions. He quarried fresh stones, and built up the church. He moulded
its thought and directed its energies. Without being great he was
exceedingly useful, and the period in which he was one of the judges of
our Israel was one of great prosperity in spiritual things. It was a
good sixty-three years, and with the previous pastorate of Dr. Gill,
enabled the church to say that during one hundred and seventeen years
they had been presided over by two ministers only. Those who are
given to change were not numerous in the community. Short pastorates
are good when ministers are feeble, but it is a great blessing when the
saints are so edified that all are content, and the ministry is so
owned of God that vacancies are filled up even before they are felt: in
such a case change would wantonly imperil the hope of continued
prosperity, and would therefore be criminal.


CHAPTER VI.—DEACON WILLIAM LEPARD.
our church recognises no distinction of clergy and
laity, it is not meet that its history should consist
entirely of the lives and labours of its pastors. It
owes, under God, very much to those faithful men
midst. Most of these accomplish the labours of
their sacred office with quiet unobtrusiveness, and
pass away without any record of their lives being given to the world,
nor are they, on this account, any the less ■ honoured and accepted
of the great Head of the Church. Occasionally, however, from remark-
able circumstances or singular gifts a deacon becomes almost as pro-
minent as the pastor, and his life is quite a landmark in the history of
the church. Such was the case with William Lepard, who was a
member of the church for 84 years, and died in our fellowship at the
age of 99. His membership ran through the pastorates of Stinton and
Gill, and into the first 27 years of that of Mr. Rippon. As the
descendants of this eminent old disciple are still honourably connected
with the Baptist body, and as the memoir written by Dr. Rippon will
aid our readers in forming some idea of the doctor himself, and of the
manners of the church in those times, we print it almost entire, only
intimating that the memoir is the closing portion of a funeral sermon
preached before the Carter Lane congregation from 2 Cor. xii. 9, and
that this fact accounts for some allusions which are not of general
interest, but which it would have been difficult to omit. We are glad
to give on the next page a likeness of the reverend old man from a
finely executed engraving in our possession : our copy falls short of
the original, but hits off the likeness well.
SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF MR. WILLIAM LEPARD,
BY DR. RIPPON.
Mr. William Lepard was descended of ancestors whose history had
neither been emblazoned by arms, nor crested with coronets ; but,
though unknown to heraldry and in the courts of princes, individuals
of his family were well known in the courts of the Lord’s house—in
thy courts, 0 Jerusalem !—from which a voice is heard this day, saying
to all his honoured descendants, “ Praise ye the Lord ! ”
His mother had the honour of being a member of the church


when it was under the pastorate of Mr. Benjamin Reach. Dr. Gill
has been heard to say, that she was an eminently pious woman.
Mr. Lepard’s grandmother also was a member of the same church :
and as, at her dissolution, she had to review a life of ninety years, it
is conceivable that she might have been one of the first members of this
church, when it was formed in 1G52.
WILLIAM LEPARD.
Our deceased friend was born September 18, 1700, and perfectly
remembered the great storm, in November, 1703, which was so pro-
verbially desolating. And he had reason to do so. His father, who
was in the building line, could not but know that the decayed house in
which he lived must be in danger by that tremendous wind j and in


the evening he said to his wife, “ Let us take the child out of bed, and
carry him over to Ezekiel Seward’s (a quaker who lived almost opposite),
for the house will be down before the morning.” And according to his
apprehensions so it was. In the night the chimney fell, and bore down
part of the roof, which brought away the flooring, and so threw out the
front; and the first sight they had, when daylight came, was the inside
of their house, and the bricks and mortar lying in the street. This dis-
tinguishing providence he used to mention very circumstantially, and
when he was not long since repeating it, he added, with much signifi-
cance, in the words of Job’s messengers, “ And I only am escaped to
tell thee.”
Before he could well read, he was taught a number of hymns and
psalms suited to the capacities of children. These were interesting
to him all his days, even in latest life. For them he was indebted,
not to his mother only, but to his grandmother, who Was no doubt of
the same opinion as her pastor, Mr. Keach, who, in the preface to
his book of sacred hymns, says, “ Since singing psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs is God’s ordinance, ’tis [evidently] the duty of parents
and heads of families to instruct their children therein, as well as to
teach them to read ; for, by learning sacred hymns, they may be taken
up before their parents are aware with the matter therein contained.”
Besides the advantages he received at home, his mother availed
herself of other opportunities for his knowing the ways of the Lord
more perfectly. She sent him to be instructed with other children at
the old meeting-house, on the spot where the Rev. John Townsend’s, at
Rotherhithe, now stands. So great .was the number of young persons
who attended there every Saturday afternoon, that two ministers at the
same time met them, and taught them the Assembly’s Catechism.’
At about fourteen years of age, one day coming from school, he went
to play with the other lads under the scaffold on which his father was
at work. He had but just come from under it when it fell, and his
father with it, who was killed on the spot, or at least did not speak
afterwards. His mother, now left a widow, felt her loss. He has
informed us with pleasure that she was “a widow indeed.” She kept a
shop, and so did Mrs. Stinton, the pastor’s wife ; but, notwithstanding
she was a widow, she had a widow’s mite for the poor, especially for
poor Christians. This circumstance our deceased friend has sometimes
mentioned with a grateful exultation.
But though the father was removed, the son was left, and much was
he the solace of his mother. Three or four days after his father’s death
a respectable bricklayer applied to the bereaved woman, and offered to
teach her son his trade if she thought he wmuld like it, and make him
free of the city. The offer was accepted. “ But,” said the mother, who
was not indifferent where her son went to hear the word, nor whether
he was a churchman or dissenter, “ you must, sir, let my son go to
meeting with me ” He agreed to it, and was as good as his word.
She experimentally knew the value of the means of grace, and longed
that they might be gracious and saving means to her son. Though he
had felt some serious concern at about ten years of age, religion had yet
made no lasting impression on his mind. But when somewhat more
than two years of his apprenticeship had expired, as he was grinding a


broad chisel which they call a brick-axe, with his back against a wall,
and his feet’on the frame in which the stone turned, the stone caugi
his apron, entangled the axe, drew him after it and cut his clothes and
the flesh of his thigh in an awful manner, to the very bone, so that his
life was in great danger. In this condition he was taken home to his
mother’s and confined to his bed, which he and others feared would be
his death-bed. While his body was in this imminent danger it pleased
the God of all grace to lead him into a serious consideration of the
dangerous condition of his soul. His mother and the pious women
who came to comfort her embraced this opportunity to convenefaith-
fully and affectionately with him, respecting his malady as a sinner, and
the remedy so gloriously exhibited in the gospel. His concern was
increased he felt more on account of his soul than of his body
And after many tears had been shed over him and
for him he was helped to begin fervently to pray for himself. He
wrestled with God “for the life of his soul,” and praying breath
spent in Tain. The Lord sent him relief frnm a pae^of
Scripture exactly suited to his case, which I lave 3, nerfect
text—“ My grace is sufficient -for thee : for my strength is made pei feet
in weakness. He did not now more sensibly feel the weakness o
his body than he did the depravity of his soul, l^ t / e h cl^ 1 c 8 r h ff om
hope that the Lord would save the one from death, and the other fro
sffiand everlasting misery. As this text “dwelt on his mind and
u sometimes filled him with joy,” he mentioned to his mother and
to several of the godly people who came to se f aa f he fth
innronsine* satisfaction,” I use his own words, in thinking ot tne
work of Christ, the influence of the Holy Spirit, and salvation from
SU So^e P Hme h after his recovery, his mother said to him, “ S°n, I would
have you go to our minister, and talk with him : ed, it
seems 5 in \he simplicity of his heart, not intending what followed.
When he had told liis case, Mr. Stinton encouraged him to go before
the church and relate the same to them. This he did—was soon after
baptised with three other persons, and then received into full commu-
nion by laying on of the hands of the pastor, according to the practice
of the church at that time. He joined this church in the year 7 7,
perhaps in the spring of that year. Mr. Stinton died February
having first been a teacher in the church, and then pastor for thirteen
° r apprenticeship had expired, and he was arriving
at an age when one should wish young persons to make their arrange-
ments for life, his master, who had formed a respect for him,
contemplating a retirement from business, came ana asked him if he
knew of any person that would stand in his place. But when he found
that the benevolent man intended the situation for himself, tears of joy
and thankfulness (for he was always affectionate and giateful) rolled
down his cheeks ; and in mentioning this circumstance to me, he said,
“Well they might, for it was a trade, as business then was, worth
hundreds a year.” This auspicious providence became the happy
means of bringing up his family in comfort and credit.
Mr. William Anderson, one of our deacons, having been sent into the


work of the ministry by this church, Mr. Lepard was appointed in his
room. Our church minutes of May 2, 1743, say that he was unani-
mously chosen at that meeting. Twenty-four days after the choice, viz.
“ Thursday, May 26,” Dr. Gill writes, “ was appointed for the ordi-
nation of him ; on which day the church met, and he was ordained
into his office.” Of that choice which was made by the church, and of
this ordination which was the act of the pastor, I have never heard
that they repented. For though in earlier days, the cares of a family
and the multiplicity of business “in city, town, or country,” as he
sometimes expressed it, precluded him from serving the church accord-
ing to the affectionate desires of his heart, —he entered on his office by
instituting, in a respectful manner, an inquiry into the circumstances
of his pastor and of the church, which terminated in the advantage of
the whole, and he was assisted afterwards, under his involuntary omis-
sions, by the wise efforts of his wife, a member of the church, and one
of the best of women. It was his honour and the happiness of the
whole church, that Mrs. Lepard had talent, and made time to assist her
husband in his office. Not by name, but in her conduct, she was, until
her death, a deaconess, as Phoebe is called.
Not many years after the death of Mrs. Lepard, the sight of the widowed
husband began to fail, and he relinquished business in favour of his
second son, in whose family he lived many years at Rotherhithe, a little
below Globe Stairs. This was his residence when I came to town in
1772. And here it was that I freely conversed with him respecting
the affairs of this church, and received his counsels. He had now
passed the first stage of Christianity, which they call comfort; and the
second, which has been denominated conflict; and was at this time
arrived at the third, the stage of contemplation. In this situation of
leisure, as he could not see to read, when the weather would permit, he
spent seven or eight hours a day in his garden, about a quarter of a
mile from his dwelling: he was there sometimes at five o’clock in the
morning, and frequently enjoyed on this spot days of unspeakable bliss.
In this peaceful retreat also, I have met and happily conversed with
him.
His vacant hours at home were well employed in the duties of
seriousness and cheerfulness. Religion always appeared in a pleasing
garb as dressed by him. Here the daughter-in-law found the care of
bringing up a family alleviated by his counsels, by his countenance, and
his conduct. When children were childish, he used to say to his
daughter, “ Let us remember we were children once—they will make
brave men and women by-and-by.” His grandchildren surrounding his
feet would listen and learn from him the hymns and little poems which
he had been taught when a child.
But while he was thus pleasingly communicative and naturally dis-
posed to make all around him happy, he did not think himself too old
to learn, and therefore engaged his daughter-in-law and her children to
read to him the word of God, and the writings of the late Dr. Gill, to
whose works he was partial in a very high degree. The younger
branches of the family recollect how fond he was of the epistles of John,
which they read over to him “many and many a time.” With a
heart so much assimilated to that of the aged and holy apostle, it is no


wonder that these epistles were dear to him. He breathed love and
gratitude.
It is worthy, I think, of peculiar observation, that neither the dis-
tance of his habitation, nor the dimness of his sight, hindered him from
being with us in the house of God. With his staff in one hand, and the
other behind his back, he walked from below Rotherhithe church to
London Bridge of a Lord’s-day, erect as in his youth, with a counte-
nance always in his favour; multitudes saying as he passed, What a fine
old man !” This practice he continued till he was in the ninetieth year
of his age, when it will not seem strange that he felt increasing
weakness, and perceived that the walk to meeting was rather more
than he could take with pleasure. This opened the way to change of
residence, nearer this place of worship, by the tender care of his eldest
son, who placed him under the wing of a respectable aged matron in
Blackman Street, in the Borough.
It was about this time, I think, that his children and grand-children,
in looking at the term of ninety years, naturally concluded that the
time drew near, when the aged saint must die ; and believing that the
first class of duties we owe belongs to God, and the second to our
parents, they determined to have a family meeting for the purpose of
expressing their most dutiful affection to him before his death. The
day was fixed, and the Grove-house at Camberwell was the place
appointed for the meeting. The day arrived. His children and
descendants were all in health, and they were all present, those who
used the distant seas not excepted—they were thirty-nine in I
was the only person present, not a relative, and made the fortieth. The
sight I shall never forget. What an assemblage ! I saw the great-
grand-children, beauteous vernal buds. The grand-children were full
blown roses. The children had passed into summer, not having
entirely lost the beauties of spring ; but the countenance and conduct,
the cheerfulness and piety of their aged father, on that day, exhibited
a man —a holy man—
“ Crowned with perpetual harvest.”
Sitting by his side, when the table was covered, I said to him, Sir, it
falls on you to ask a blessing. He rose like a patriarch, at the head of
his family, and in these words taken as they flowed from his lips, he
addressed the Supreme Majesty :
“ Ever-living and ever-loving God ! thou hast been pleased to bless
thine unworthy dust with this family : —0 Lord, bless them !He would
give them all into thine hands. Bless them in their bodies, and bless
them in their souls ; and may great grace be upon them all! We now
beg thy blessing upon what is before us, that it may be refreshing
to us, and that we may glorify thee, the Father of all our mercies,
for Jesus’ sake.” Every voice said, Amen.
Dinner and the services of the table being over, one present waved
his hand, at which the whole company were on their feet, and humbly
representing the rest, he said, “We look at our venerable father and
thank him for his care of us in youth, his advice to us in riper years,
and his affectionate concern for us to this hour. May his last days be
his best days ! ”


Many years antecedent to this, there is sufficient reason to believe
that this honoured man had been advancing in purity and in bliss, nor
was his career less holy and happy afterwards. He classed not with the
chilling and disheartening circle of aged professors, compared by Mr. Top-
lady to decayed mile stones, which have lost their inscription, and answer
no end in the world but that of mortifying the traveller, who looks to read
how far he has to go to reach his journey’s end, but looks in vain.
No man more cheerfully said than Mr. Lepard, from time to time, “ By
the grace of God, lam what I am.” But we ourselves subjoin, that the
grace of God which was bestowed upon him was not in vain. A decayed
mile stone ! No ; though almost ninety years of age when he came to
reside in this neighbourhood, he appeared in general as lively in his
soul as any young Christian in the church. Our Lord’s-day morning
prayer-meetings, at half-past nine o’clock, will witness this. How
constant was his attendance! He was often present one .of the first. At
these beneficial services, his very countenance did good to younger
Christians, and to persons more advanced. At one time, as he entered, I
heard him say, “ Peace be to you, my brethren, in the name of the
Lord.” At another time he breathed this language, “My feet shall
stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem !” He mostly came among us
with cheerfulness, and always with solemnity. How animating has it
been to the church and the congregation, to see the son lead the
father, whose eyes were dim by reason of age, through the aisle to the
pew, and to see the venerable man take his seat! How have our
hearts moved and melted while witnessing his devotion in the house
of the Lord, and especially at the Lord’s table !
But his piety, conspicuous abroad, was also eminent at home. There
he uttered not the language of murmuring and suspicion. The voice of
fretfulness, peevishness, and the other attendant frailties and crimes of
old age, were far from his tents. He was condescending to the young,
affectionate to his children, attentive to his friends, courteous to all, and
a most rigid observer of the truth in all his intercourse with the world
and the church. Though, I think, he was somewhat too backward
in the performance of public prayer, he was a pattern in private prayer.
Morning, noon, and night, he constantly attempted to draw near to God,
and when, through age, he could not retire for the performance of this
holy duty, those who were around him withdrew and left him alone. Of
late years, it was pretty much his custom to use his voice distinctly in
this service ; and it is well known that he was mighty in prayer through
the power of the Holy Ghost. He finished his day with prayer, and
entered on the next with praise. To all this I must yet add, that
during the last eight or nine years of his life, from ninety years of age
and upwards, his days were happier than they were long, being
eminently unclouded and blissful. The intervals of prayer he con-
tinually filled up with praise. Two, three, or four hymns a day, unless
he was ill, which was seldom the case, were cheerfully sung by him ;
and sometimes he was singing almost all the day. Three of his
favourite hymns and psalms, which he sung much oftener than the rest,
were these : —the twenty-third psalm by Dr. Watts, beginning with,
“ The Lord my shepherd is,
I shall be well supplied."


And that hymn in which is this remarkable verse—
“ Hail, great Immanuel, all divine:
In thee thy Father’s glories shine!
Thou brightest, sweetest, fairest one,
That eyes have seen, or angels known!”
And this also—
“ Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly dove,
With all thy quickening powers &c.
What has been hitherto related concerning our deceased friend, is
pretty generally known in most of our little circles, and has been
sometimes repeated in our parlours ; it cannot therefore possibly be
considered in the light of posthumous commendation, lavished with a
prodigal hand over the ashes of the dead, to which the public voice
would have denied its sanction while he was living ; but all my friends,
and every member of the church, will estimate this report, made in
honour of the grace of God, as an eulogy of sober praise to which our
deceased friend and father had a legitimate claim ; for his life had
indeed been a living testimony. He has also left a dying testimony,
which I shall now state if you will indulge me with your patience.
You will be glad to hear that his powers of memory were good till
the last day but one of his life. About a fortnight before he died, I
called, and saw him happy. He had just finished singing one of his
hymns as I came to the door. A few days after, as lam informed, he
felt a pain in his back for about five minutes, which it seems was all
the pain he endured. Debility came on ; his case was perfectly under-
stood ; medical assistance was administered with equal kindness and
skill by a respectable member of his family, who prudently gave an
intimation to the other affectionate relatives that nine or ten days would
terminate the complaint, which was a dissolution of the blood. The
eighth day of the ten arrived ; and then Saturday, the ninth of the ten.
In the morning of it, his eldest son and daughter, attending his bed
side, witnessed the happiness of the good man, whose language, now
often repeated, was, “ Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his
benefits.” “ Thou hast dealt bountifully with me.” He then distinctly
and at length recounted the Lord’s dealings w'ith him in providence,
and his kindness as the God of grace. He afterwards spake with much
energy of the love of God, who passed by fallen angels, and before all
worlds elected a certain number of men to salvation out of every nation,
and kindred, and tongue, and people; “Yea,” said he, “and chose
them to himself, and for himself, gave them to his Son to redeem, and
by his Holy Spirit makes them meet for the inheritance of the saints
in light,” adding, “ I hope you are no strangers to these things, on
which your dear minister is so often speaking to you.” He expatiated
on the love of Christ, as enduring the cross and despising the shame,
before he sat down at his Father’s right hand. After remaining a few
minutes composed and still, he broke out in one of the most sublime
and beautiful prayers. He prayed for himself, that the enemy might
be as still as a stone, while he passed over Jordan ; he prayed for his
sons ; for his daughter, then by his bedside ; for each of his grand-
children, and their children, that they might be a generation to serve
the Lord. In the afternoon he spoke in adoring strains of the


covenant of grace, and expressed his joy in prospect of the latter-
day glory, and of Christ as presenting the church to his Father without
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. At intervals he sung Hallelujah ;
and indeed his room seemed to be the antechamber of glory.
This Saturday evening I had the pleasure to visit him again. I
found him somewhat exhausted by much exertion in conversing with
his children one after another, in the different parts of. the day ; but
his recollection was perfect, and with detail he continued to relate,
for about half-an-hour, some of the kind providences of God towards
him in early life, which he had several times mentioned to me when
he was in full health, and now, as circumstantially as ever. “ I have
been talking to my son William,” said he, “ who has known my life
from the fifteenth year of his age till now.” But I dismiss the
whole of his conversation, except one thing.
Who could have borne to hear the love and gratitude of this ancient
and apostolic man, when with his dying lips he thanked his son
for all his kindness to him, saying, “Son, you have been a Joseph
to me.”
I turn from the subject a moment, and request that I may become
an angel of entreaty to ail the young people in this assembly, especially
to those who have praying and godly parents. I beseech you, in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that as opportunity may offer, you will
each of you, with duty, affection, and gratitude, aspire to be a Joseph
to your aged parents.
It was about seven o’clock in the evening, when- I proposed the
following questions to him : his answers were pencilled by a person at
his bedside, as they came from his lips :
Q. Are you in pain, sir ?
A. I am not, sir, blessed be God. This is a comfort, sir, a very
great one.
Q. Do you know, sir, what day it will be to-morrow ?
A. Yes, Lord’s-day ; the Lord crown the day with his blessing !
What, sir, are there any people then to join you to-morrow, to join the
church ?
Q. No, sir, not to-morrow j but you joined it once, sir ?
A. Yes, and a charming day it was, blessed be God. He has given
me a name and a place in his house, better than that of sons and
daughters : and that was a charming day, sir, when he said to me,
“My grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made perfect in
weakness.” And it was so. It was so.
Q. Do any of the truths and promises which comforted you formerly,
support you now, sir ? _
A. Yes, the first words are good now ; he does strengthen me, he
does support me. I cannot wait upon him now as I could then : I
cannot do as I would. I wish for more light, and more life, and moie
love : though I have lost my sight, I can look back and see the way by
which he has brought me, and I can look forward too, sir. Oh, that’s
comfortable!
Q. I am afraid, sir, I tire you ?
A. Oh no, sir, lam not tired, if you are not; lam willing to speak,
if you are willing to hear.


Q- If you should, within a few hours, sir, meet Dr. Gill in glory ?
A . Ay, and my mother, and grandmother, and multitudes of precious
souls besides, and the precious Jesus.
After giving him a little time I proposed one question more.
Q. Have you, sir, any fear of death ?
A. No fear of death ; lam not afraid at all; I know the Lord to be
my strength, my portion, and my God. “ The Lord is my portion, saith
my soul ; therefore will I hope in him.” This text he repeated, and
then said, He will not forsake me now, he has given me his word he will
not; I have his gospel for it.
So far was he from being exercised with the fear of death, that in the
forenoon of this very day, the last day of his reason, and the last but
one of his life, he had been most pleasantly singing several verses, of
which these are some of the lines—
“ The grave is a refining pot,” &e.
And when he came to this part of them,
“The flesh shall lose its dross,
And like the sun shall rise,”
he lifted up his hands with every expression of joy ; and finding that
he could not sing all the verses through as distinctly as he had done
before, speaking of the aged servant in the house, he said, “ she can
help me out.” Here was vigour at ninety-nine years of age ! Here
was bliss on the very shores of death. How gracious was God to this
his servant ! Was not this departing in peace, having seen God’s
salvation ? My heart and voice said, “ let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like his.” With this desire, assured
that God would safely convey him over the river, I pressed his dying
hand to my lips, and he as affectionately kissed mine in return. “ The
Lord be with you,” said he ; I replied, " and with your spirit !” and
so we parted on Saturday evening about nine of the clock. And this I
believe was the last regular conversation that he held with any person,
and a wish being expressed that he might be kept still all the night’
nothing particular transpired after that time.
I called to see him between the morning and afternoon services of
the Lord’s-day, and perceived that he was fast going the way of all
the earth. His eldest son, a deacon of this church, spent the afternoon
of the day with him waiting to see his last ; and he frequently heard
him say,—Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah ; and as far as he could
interpret, he thought his dying father was saying or singing in death,
“Glory, honour, praise, and power,
Be unto the Lamb for ever,
Jesus Christ is our Redeemer !
Hallelujah !"
Which was the last word he attempted to articulate ; and thus he
sweetly fell asleep in Jesus, just as we were going out of meeting in the
afternoon, Lord’s-day, January 20, 1799, in the 99th year of his age
having been a member of this church about eighty-two years.


CHAPTER VII.— I THREE SHORT PASTORATES.
next pastor of our Church was Mr., now Doctor,
JOSEPH ANGUS, .
a gentleman whose career since he left us to become
secretary of the Baptist Missionary Society, and after-
war(js the tutor of Stepney Academy, now Regent’s
Park College, has rendered his name most honourable among living
Baptists. He is one of the foremost classical scholars, and is a member
of the committee for producing a revised version of the Holy Scriptures.
He is the author of those standard books, 44 The Bible Handbook , 4
Handbook of the English Tongue ,” and “Handbook of English Literature .”
We cannot better describe his coming to New Park Street than by
quoting a part of the paper in the church-book, which was read by Mr.
Gale, one of the deacons, at the ordination service, held December 27th,
1837. . .
“ With so aged a minister as Dr. Rippon, declining m mental energy
and bodily strength, it was not to be wondered ac that, during his
latter years, the church should be reduced in numbers, as well of
members as of general hearers—but when there is added the circum-
stances of our having been turned out of the place in which we had
worshipped for upwards of seventy years, and that for about three years
we had to seek accommodation from the kindness of other churches,
assembling at different times in Unicorn Yard, in Miles s Lane, and
in Dean Street —such of the friends present as are acquainted with our
historv, will readily believe that those who have taken a management
in the* affairs of the church have often felt their hearts sinking within
them at the fear of its entire dissolution.
“ For several years we laid various plans, but they were frustrated.
We had set our minds on various ministers, but we were not allowed the
opportunity of inviting them. We felt for our section of the chuich as
though that were the most important; but by our disappointments and
by the placing of those ministers over other sections of the church
which required to be provided for, we were taught that the great Head
of the Church watched over the whole flock, and under this consideration
we were encouraged to hope that the time would come when we also
should be cared for, and we were led to believe that his care would be
manifested to us in the most suitable time.
44 As the most effectual way of obtaining our wishes a special Prayer


Meeting was appointed to be holden every alternate week. 4 Prayer
made the darkened cloud withdraw.’ The name of onr dear brother,
Joseph Angus, was in a short time mentioned to us as that of a zealous
and studious young minister ; and what was of most importance, as of
a young man of ardent piety. He was at that time pursuing his studies
at Edinburgh, where he was expected to continue till the end of April.
He was written to with a request that he would supply for us during
the month of May. His reply to this request did not arrive for several
days, but when we received it we were encouraged by the words in which
it commences. They were these : ‘My unwillingness to make even the
most trifling movement until some effort had been made to ascertain
the Divine will has prevented my answering your letter earlier.’
“ The church had sought by prayer—the answer was given after prayer;
and the letter concluded by leading us to expect him on the second
or third Sabbath in May.
“A severe illness arising from a winter session at the University of
more than usual labour, and the subsequent illness and death of a dear
sister, compelled him to postpone his visit, and he did not arrive
amongst us until the first of October. We, however, continued our
special Prayer Meetings for Divine direction, under our peculiar circum-
stances. Mr. Angus was not known to any of us ; we had, therefore,
no personal predilections in his favour. We had sought a pastor from
the great Shepherd of the church, and we trusted to him to supply us
with one.
“On the Ist of October Mr. Angus came among us as a stranger, but
he was no stranger at the close of the next week. We had heard good
reports of him, and we had the gratification of finding all our expecta-
tions more than realized. Having been favoured with his labours on
two Sabbath-days and also at our weekly and special prayer meetings,
we hesitated not to request that (after he should have been at Oxford,
where he had promised to supply for a month) he would renew his visit
to us for three months. His discourses to us, however, on the third
and fourth Sabbaths in October, and his visits among the people so
convinced us that our prayers had been heard, and that God had sent
us a ‘ Pastor according to his own heart, who should feed us with
knowledge and understanding,’ that we could no longer content our-
selves with our previous invitation, but determined before he went to
Oxford to call a special meeting of the church. It was numerously
attended, and after solemn prayer and serious deliberation, it was
resolved without a dissentient voice, and we believe with an entirely
unanimous feeling, to invite him to become the pastor of this church.”
The union thus formed was confirmed by the divine blessing, and
cemented .by mutual esteem. During Mr. Angus’ pastorate the
privilege of communing at the Lord’s table was extended to members
of other churches, whether baptized or not, and this was done quietly
and without division, though a considerable minority did not agree
with it. The church remains a community of baptized believers, and
its constitution will not admit any persons into its membership but
those immersed upon personal profession of faith in the Lord Jesus ;
but it does not attempt to judge the order and discipline of other
churches, and has fellowship in the breaking of bread with all churches


which form parts of the mystical body of Christ: thus it endeavours
to fulfil at the same time the duties of purity and love.
In December, 1839, the Baptist Missionary Society invited Mr. Angus
to become its Home Secretary. The members were deeply grieved, and
passed a resolution expressive of their indignation, mentioning among
other reasons why they should not be robbed of their pastor that
“when this meeting contemplates that within twelve months nearly
fifty members have been added through their pastor’s instrumentality,
and that from the number of enquirers there is a prospect of still
larger additions, they cannot but appeal to the Christian feelings of
their brethren on the Committee of the Baptist Missionary Society,
requesting them to consider whether they are not inflicting a wound on
the church which no circumstances can justify.” Corporations, how-
ever, have few bowels of compassion, and so after various interim
arrangements the beloved minister was removed from his people. A
sense of the importance of the Missionary Society, and the fact that
after much deliberation the committee could not discover any one else
about whom they could be at all unanimous, were the motives which
led him to leave the church, to the deep regret of all the members.
After the removal of Dr. Angus the church was happily directed to hear
MR. JAMES SMITH,
whose useful ministry in Cheltenham was an abundant guarantee
that he was likely to prove the right man to collect a congregation
in New Park Street. He was pastor for about eight years and a
half, from 1841 to 1850, and then returned to Cheltenham, from
which many of his best friends are of opinion that he ought never
to have removed. He was a man of slender education, but of great
natural ability, sound in the faith, intensely earnest, and a ready speaker.
He is the author of a very large number of little books, which are pub-
lished at a cheap rate by Milner and Sowerby, of Halifax, and have been
the means of numberless conversions, as well as of the comfort and edi-
fication of believers. Few men have ever been more useful than he.
Happily for us he kept a diary of his own inward experience, and we can-
not better illustrate the course of his ministry than by quoting from it
those passages which have a direct reference to his labours in London.
“ 1841. Nov. 9th. —Having received an invitation from the church
at New Park Street, London, after much prayer and searching of heart,
I have this night resigned my office as pastor of the Church in Salem.
This is a painful crisis in my history. I feel it deeply, but I trust I
am acting in accordance with the will of God.”
“ 1842. April 10th.—When I left Cheltenham and came to reside in
London, I found the church in a very low state, and the congregation
very small. I trust the Lord brought me here. Many more attend the
word, and the people profess to profit; some are impressed, but the

“1844. Nov. 19. —The church now increases faster than it has done
since I have been its pastor, but not so fast as I wish to see it. I try
a variety of means, and feel determined to leave no stone unturned for
its welfare and advantage. I am surrounded by a great many young
people, very hopeful characters. This encourages me, and I continue to
plead with God for many of them by name, and I preach to them
monthly. oto have many of them given unto me as my joy and
crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord ! ”
“1846. Nov. 19 —We have had many converted to God under the
preaching of the word, and the church now numbers 450. To God
alone be all the praise ! ”
“ 1847. Nov. 19. —The church increases, the congregation is larger
than it has been since I have been in London, and my ministry is
blessed to the conversion of sinners, especially my monthly sermons to
the young. I bless God that I ever began this practice, and that I
have persevered in it until now.”
“ 1848. July. —We have had many removals of late and not so many
additions, so that I begin to feel sad and somewhat unsettled, for I feel
as if I could not live, much less be happy, if souls are not constantly
brought to God. I have spoken to the church on the subject from Psalm
Ixxiv. 9. ‘We see not our signs.’ After noticing God’s condescension
in granting signs and tokens under the former dispensation, and the
design of them, I endeavoured to set forth the signs we desire to
witness. Signs of life imparted to those who are dead in sin, liveliness
in the saints, and a revival of religion in the church and congregation.
Observing, ‘we see notour signs,’ for few are added to the church, few
are found deciding for God, few are enquiring the way to Zion, few are
found properly affected with the state of the world and the church.
Our prayer-meetings are not thronged. The spirit of wrestling prayer
does not appear ; the Lord's arm is not laid bare. The language of my
soul must now be, ‘ I will wait for the Lord, who hideth himself from
the house of Israel, and I will look for him.’ 0 that he would soon

“1850. February. —I have written my resignation of office, and
laid it before the deacons. It is a serious and important step which I
have taken. I trust I have taken it in a proper spirit, and from a
right motive. My mind is now calm and peaceful, the agitation from
which I have long been suffering is at an end, and I feel as if I could
now leave the matter with the Lord.”
“ When my resignation was accepted, the church passed a very kind
and affectionate resolution, regretting that I felt it necessary to take


such a step but as I had rested it pretty much on the state of
my health, they did not feel that they could refuse to accede to
my wishes. I cannot say that I have laboured in vain here for

closing a ministry of two years. These changes sadly diminished the

CHAPTER VIII.—C. H. SPURGEON.
JT is not to be expected that we should write the story of
our own personal ministry : this must be left to other
P enß ’ thought worth while to write it at all. We
jtt-'. could not turn these pages into an autobiography, nor
Y' we Ter y well ask any one else to write about us,
an( * therefore we shall simply give bare facts, and ex-
tracts from the remarks of others.
On one of the last Sabbaths of the month of December, 1853, C. EL
Spurgeon, being then nineteen years of age, preached in New Park
Street Chapel, in response to an invitation which, very much to his
surprise, called him away from a loving people in Waterbeach, near
Cambridge, to supply a London pulpit. The congregation was a mere
handful. The chapel seemed very large to the preacher, and very
gloomy, but he stayed himself on the Lord, and delivered his message
from James i. 17. There was an improvement even on the first
evening, and the place looked more cheerful; the text was, “They are
without fault before the throne of God.” •
In answer to earnest requests, C. H. Spurgeon agreed to preach in
London on the first, third, and fifth Sundays in January, 1854. but
before the last of these Sabbaths he had received an invitation, dated
Jan. 25, inviting him to occupy the pulpit for six months upon proba-
tion. The reply to this invitation will be found entire in Mr. Pike’s
“ Sketches of Nonconformity in Southwark .”
The six months’ probation was never fulfilled, for there was no need.
The place was filling, the prayer-meetings were full of power, and con-
version was going on. A requisition for a special meeting, signed by
fifty of the male members 'was sent in to the deacons on April 12, and
according to the church book it was, on April 1 9, resolved unanimously,
“ that we tender our brother, the Rev. C. H. Spurgeon, a most cordial
and affectionate invitation forthwith to become pastor of this church,
and we pray that the result of his services may be owned of God with
an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a revival of religion in our
midst; that it may be fruitful in the conversion of sinners and in the
edification of those that believe.”
To this there was but one reply, and it was therefore answered in the
affirmative in a letter dated, 75, Dover Road, April 28, 1854, also in-
serted in Mr. Pike’s book, which can be had of our publishers.
In a very short time the congregation so multiplied as to make the


chapel in the evening, when the gas was burning, like the black-hole
of Calcutta. One evening in 1854 the preacher exclaimed, “ By faith the
C. H. SPURGEON.
walls of Jericho fell down, and by faith this wall at the back shall come
down, too.” An aged and prudent deacon in somewhat domineering
terms observed to him, at the close of the sermon. “ Let us never hear


of that again.” “ What do you mean ?” said the preacher, “ you will hear
no more about it when it is done, and therefore the sooner you set about
doing it the better.” A meeting was held, and a fund was commenced,
and in due course the vestries and schools were laid into the chapel
and a new school-room was erected along the side of the chapel, with
windows which could be let down, to allow those who were seated in the
school to hear the preacher. While this was being done, worship
was carried on at Exeter Hall, from Feb. 11, 1855, to May 27 of the
same year. At this time paragraphs began to appear in the papers
announcing that the Strand was blocked up by crowds who gathered
to hear a young man in Exeter Hall. Remarks of no very flattering
character appeared in various journals, and the multitude was thereby
increased. Caricatures, such as “Brimstone and Treacle” adorned
BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE.
the printsellers’ windows, the most ridiculous stories were circulated,
and the most cruel falsehoods invented, but all these things worked
together for good. The great Lord blessed the word more and more
to the conversion of the hearers, and Exeter Hall was thronged through-
out the whole time of our sojourn.
To return to New Park-street, enlarged though it was, resembled
the attempt to put the sea into a teapot. We were more inconvenienced
than ever. To turn many hundreds away was the general if not the
universal necessity, and those who gained admission were but little
better off, for the packing was dense in the extreme, and the heat
something terrible even to remember. Our enemies continued to make
our name more and more known by penny pamphlets and letters
in the papers, which all tended to swell the crowd. More caricatures
appeared, and among the rest “ Catch-’em-alive-O !”

In June 1856 we were again at Exeter Hall, preaching there in the
evening and at the chapel in the morning ; but this was ielt to be
inconvenient, and therefore in August a fund was commenced to
provide for the erection of a larger house of prayer. Meanwhile the
CATCH-'EM-ALIVE-O!
Exeter Hall proprietors intimated that they were, unable to. let their
hall continuously to one congregation, and therefore we looked about
us for another place. Most opportunely a large hall, in the y
Surrey Gardens! was just completed for the monster concerts of
M. Jullien, and, with some trembling at the magnitude ot the c 1 ,
this hall was secured for Sabbath evenings. T . d . g . dav
We find the following entry in the Church-book h
rw IQ On the evening of this day, in accordance
resolution passed at the Church meeting, Oct. «<*, the dlmreh
gregation assembled to hear our pastor, in the Mu 70001 were
Surrey Gardens. A very large number of persons (about 7000) were
assembled on that occasion, and the service was commenced 1 the übu
way, by singing, reading the Scriptures, and prayer how
ever, after our Pastor had commenced his prayer a disturbance w
caused (as it is supposed, by some evil-disposed perso | ic>
concert), and the whole congregation were seized with a suddei 1


This caused a fearful rush to the doors, particularly from the galleries.
Several persons, either in consequence of their heedless haste, or from
the extreme pressure of the crowd behind, were thrown down on the
stone steps of the north-west staircase, and were trampled on by the
SURREY MUSIC HALL.
crowd pressing upon them. The lamentable result was that seven
persons lost their lives, and twenty-eight were removed to the hospitals
seriously bruised and injured. Our pastor not being aware that any
loss of life had occurred, continued in the pulpit, endeavouring by every


means in his power to alleviate the fear of the people, and was suc-
cessful to a very considerable extent. In attempting to renew the
service, it was found that the people were too excited to listen to him,
and the service was closed, and the people who remained dispersed
quietly. This lamentable circumstance produced very serious effects on
the nervous system of our pastor. He was entirely prostrated for some
days, and compelled to relinquish his preaching engagements. Through
the great mercy of our heavenly Father, he was, however, restored so as
to be able to occupy the pulpit in our own chapel on Sunday, Oct. 31st,
and gradually recovered his wonted health and vigour. ‘The Lords
name be praised !’
“ The church desire to note this event in their minutes, and to record
their devout thankfulness to God that in this sad calamity the lives of
their beloved pastor, the deacons, and members were all preserved ; and
also with the hope that our heavenly Father from this seeming evil
may produce the greatest amount of real lasting good.”
This was the way in which this great affliction was viewed by our
church ; but we had, in addition to the unutterable pain of the whole
catastrophe, to bear the wicked accusations of the public press. We
will give only one specimen; it is taken from a popular newspaper which
has long been most friendly to us, and therefore we will not mention
names. In the days of its ignorance it said—“ Mr. Spurgeon is a
preacher who hurls damnation at the heads of his sinful hearers. Some
men there are who, taking their precepts from Holy Writ, would
beckon erring souls to a rightful path with fair words and gentle admo-
nition ; Mr. Spurgeon would take them by the nose and bully them into
religion. Let us set up a barrier to the encroachments and blasphemies
of men like Spurgeon, saying to them, ‘ Thus far shalt thou come and
no further let us devise some powerful means which shall tell to the
thousands who now stand in need of enlightenment—This man, in his
own opinion, is a righteous Christian, but in ours nothing more than
a ranting charlatan. We are neither straightlaced nor Sabbatarian
in our sentiments : but we would keep apart, widely apart, the
theatre and the church—above all, would we place in the hand of
every right-thinking man, a whip to scourge from society the authors
of such vile blasphemies as on Sunday night, above the cries of the
dead and the dying, and louder than the wails of misery from the
maimed and suffering, resounded from the mouth of Mr. Spurgeon in
the Music Hall of the Surrey Gardens.”
A fund was raised to help the poor sufferers, and to avoid all fear of
further panic the preacher resolved to hold the service in the morning,
though that part of the day is least favourable to large congregations.
The multitude came, however, and continued still to come for three
good years. All classes came, both high and low. We have before us
a list of the nobility who attended the Music Hall, but as we never
felt any great elation at their attendance, or cared to have their
presence blazoned abroad, we will not insert the names. It was a far
greater joy to us that hundreds came who were led to seek the Lord,
and to find eternal life in him.
A famous letter, signed Habitans in Sicco, and dated from Broad
Phylactery, Westminster, appeared at this period in the “ Times,” and


as it was known to be written by an eminent scholar it produced a
very favourable impression. Part of the letter ran as follows :
“ I want to hear Spurgeon ; let us go.” Now, lam supposed to be a high
churchman, so I answered, “ What! go and hear a Calvinist—a Baptist!—a
man who ought to be ashamed of himself for being so near the Church, and
yet not within its pale?” “Nevermind ; come and hear him.” Well, we went
yesterday morning to the Music Hall, in the Surrey Gardens Fancy a
congregation consisting of 10,000 souls, streaming into the Hall, mounting the
galleries, humming, buzzing, and swarming—a mighty hive of bees—eager to
secure at first the best places, and, at last, any place at all. After waiting more
than half an hour—for if you wish to have a seat you must be there at least
that space of time in advance—Mr. Spurgeon ascended his tribune. To the
hum, and rush, and trampling of men, succeeded a low, concentrated thrill and
murmur of devotion, which seemed to run at once, like an electric current,
through the breast of every one present; and by this iflagnetic chain, the
preacher held us fast bound for about two hours. It is not my purpose to give
a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say ot his voice, that its power
and volume are sufficient to reach every one in that vast assembly; ot his
language, that it is neither high-flown nor homely ; of h>s style, that it is at
times familiar, at times declamatory, but always happy, and often eloquent; of
his doctrine, that neither the Calvinist nor the Baptist appears in the forefront
of the battle which is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless animosity, and
with gospel weapons, against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret
bosom sins which so easily beset a man in daily life ; and to sum up all in a
word, it is enough to say of the man himself, that he impresses you with a
perfect conviction of his sincerity.
But I have not written so much about my children’s want of spiritual
food when they listened to the mumbling of the Archbishop of , and my
own banquet at the Surrey Gardens, without a desire to draw a practical con-
clusion from these two stories, and to point them by a moral. Here is a man
not more Calvinistic than many an incumbent of the Established Church, who
“ humbles and mumbles,” as old Latimer says, over his liturgy and text —here is
a man who says the complete immersion, or something of the kind, of adults
is necessary to baptism. These are his faults of doctrine; but if I were the
examining chaplain of the Archbishop of , I would say, “May it please
your grace, here is a man able to preach eloquently, able to fill the largest
church in England with his voice, and what is more to the purpose, with
people. And may it please your grace, here are two churches in the metropolis,
St. Paul’s and Westminster Abbey. What does your grace think of inviting
Mr. Spurgeon, this heretical Calvinist and Baptist, who is able to draw 10,000
souls after him, just to try his voice, some Sunday morning, in the nave of
either of those churches ? ”
On October 7th, 1857, the day of National Humiliation for the In-
dian Mutiny, Mr. Spurgeon preached in the centre transept of the
Crystal Palace to more than 23,000 people, and the sum of £686 was
paid over to the National Fund.
Meanwhile the collection of funds for a new building went on, and
in January, 1858, the money in hand was £6lOO ; by January, 1859,
it was £9,639, and £5,000 of it was set aside to pay for the ground
near the Elephant and Castle. We went plodding on, the pastor col-
lecting personally, or by his sermons, very much of the money, travelling
far and wide to do so; Scotch friends especially helping; till in
January, 1860, after the first stone had been laid, £16,868 was in hand,
or more than half of the sum required, so that the land had been paid
for, and instalments paid to the builder as required. The first stone


of the Metropolitan Tabernacle was laid with great rejoicings,
August 16th, 1859, by Sir Morton Peto; but as a report of the whole
proceedings can be procured of our publishers we will say but little
here. We feel constrained, however, to mention the singular providence
which placed Mr. Spicer and other friends upon the Court ot the Fish-
mongers’ Company, so as to secure the land; next, the fact that the
company was able to sell the freehold; and, next, that the late Mr. W illiam
Joynson, of Mary Cray, deposited the amount to pay for an Act of
Parliament to enable the company to sell in case it had turned out that
they had not the legal power to do so. Singularly happy also was the
circumstance that a gentleman in Bristol, who had never heard the
pastor, nevertheless gave no less a sum than £5,000 towards the build-
ing. Eternity alone can reveal all the generous feeling and self-denying
liberality evinced by Christian people in connection with this enter-
prise,—to us at any rate so gigantic at the time that apart from
divine aid we could never have carried it through. One of the chief
of our mercies was the fact that our beloved brother, W illiam Higgs,
was our builder, and treated us with unbounded liberality throughout
the whole affair. He is now a worthy deacon of our church.
In December, 1859, we left the Surrey Music Hall. We paid the
company a large sum for our morning service, and this was the only
amount out of which a dividend was paid. They proposed to open the
gardens for amusement on the Lord's-day evening, and we threatened
to give up our tenancy if they did so. This prevented the evil for some
time, but at length the baser sort prevailed, and under the notion
that Sunday “pleasure” would prove remunerative, they advertised that
the gardens would be opened on the Sabbath : we, therefore, felt
bound in honour to leave the place, and we did so. After a while a
fire almost destroyed the building, and the relics were for years turned
into a hospital. We commenced on December 18th, 1859, our third
and longest sojourn at Exeter Hall, which ended on March Ist, 1861.
A few of our remarks upon leaving that place may fitly be quoted
] lore#
“ in the providence of God we, as a church and people, have had to
wander often. This is our third sojourn within these walls. It is now
about to close. We have had at all times and seasons a compulsion for
moving : sometimes a compulsion of conscience, at other times a
compulsion of pleasure, as on this occasion. lam sure that when we
first went to the Surrey Music Hall, God went with us. Satan went
too, but he fled before us. That frightful calamity, the impression of
which can never be erased from my mind, turned out in the providence
of God to be one of the most wonderful means of turning public atten-
tion to special services, and I do not doubt that fearlul catastrophe
though it was —it has been the mother of multitudes of blessings. Ihe
Christian world noted the example ; and saw its after-success ; they
followed it; and to this day, in the theatre and in the cathedral, the
word of Christ is preached where it was never preached before. In each
of our movings we have had reason to see the hand of God, and here par-
ticularly ; for many residents in the West End have in this place come
to listen to the word, who probably might not have taken a journey
beyond the river. Here God’s grace has broken hard hearts ; here have


souls been renewed, and wanderers reclaimed. Give unto the Lord,
0 ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength ; give unto the
Lord the glory due unto his name.’ And now we journey to the house
which God has in so special a manner given to us, and this day would
1 pray as Moses did, ‘liise up, Lord, and let, thine enemies be scattered,
and let them that hate thee flee before thee. .
In 1859, the church for the first time appointed Elders to aid the
Pastor in the spiritual concerns of the church. Tins arrangement has
been of vital importance and has met a manifest necessity. Of honoured
men who have filled this office we could mention many names, but it
would extend this history beyond our limits, .
In Feb. 1860, the Pastor visited Pans, preaching in the Eglise de
l’Oratoire, and in the American Chapel, to crowded houses. At this
time M. Provost Paradol wrote an enthusiastic critique, which from a
Catholic was the more remarkable. We have, however, no space for it,
nor for more than an allusion to sermons preached m June of this year
in Geneva, in the Cathedral from the pulpit of John Calvin, and m the
church of M. D’Aubigue. . ■, ~
Under date January 6th, 1861, there stands in our records the
following solemn declaration, signed by the pastor and leading friends.
“This church needs rather more than £4,000 to enable it to open tht
New Tabernacle free of all debt. It humbly asks this temporal mercy
of God, and believes that for Jesus’ sake the prayer will be heard and
the boon bestowed. As witness our hands.”
Now let the reader mark that, on May 6th of the same year, the pastor
and many friends also signed their names to another testimony, which
is worded as follows : “We, the undersigned members of the church lately
worshipping in New Park Street Chapel, but now assembling in the
Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington, desire with overflowing hearts to
make known and record the lovingkmdness of our faithful God. We
asked in faith, but our Lord has exceeded our desires for not only was
the whole sum given us, but far sooner than _we had looked for it
Truly the Lord is good and worthy to be praised. We are ashamed o
ourselves that we have ever doubted him, and we Fay that as a church
and as individuals we may be enabled to'trust in the Lord at all tiroes
with confidence, so that in quietness we may possess our souls. lo
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost we offer praise and thanksgiving, and we
set to our seal that God is true.” ~ , f ,, *
After about a month of Opening Services of which a full account,
can be had of our publishers, we began regular work at the Tabernacle
in May 1861, the whole building being free of debt, and the accounts
showing that £31,332 4s. lOd. had been received, and the same
amount expended. Truly we serve a gracious God.
The Tabernacle is 146 feet long, 81 feet broad, and 62 feet high.
There are some 5,500 sittings of all kinds. There is room for 6,000
persons without excessive crowding; and we have also a lecture-hal
holding about 900, schoolroom for 1000 children, six class-rooms, kit-
chen, lavatory, and retiring rooms below stairs. We a lad
room for working meetings, young men’s class-room, and Secretary s
room on the ground floor; three vestries, for pastor deacons and elders
on first floor, and three store-rooms on the second floor, ihe accom-


modation is all too little for the work to be carried on, and we are
glad to use the rooms at the almshouses and the college.
During the month of January, 1863, the Pastor preached in most of
the large towns of Holland, and had a lengthened interview with the
Queen of the Netherlands. The sermons are largely circulated in the
Dutch language.
In the month of June, 1864, a sermon was preached by C. H. S.
in the Metropolitan Tabernacle which raised a wide-spread controversy,
upon the important subject of Baptismal Regeneration. Rectors, and
curates, and deans, and canons, rose in the fulness of their indignation,
and fulminated pamphlets, which were met with replies of equal
warmth. The sermon itself has reached a circulation of 200,000, and
remains as our earnest protest against the unnatural use of language by
the clergy, and as a proof positive that the Book of Common Prayer
contains words which are calculated to teach the most deadly error.
The vituperation which followed upon this discourse, has been cheer-
fully endured for the truth’s sake, until at this moment some of
of our fiercest opponents are our friends, and hundreds who were led to
look into the matter for the first time are now among our firmest
adherents. When the time comes some curious incidents connected
with this conflict may be narrated, but not now.
Many interesting events have occurred since then, but we have not
space to record them. In May, 1867, while the Tabernacle was re-
paired, we occupied the Agricultural Hall for five Sabbaths, and had it
crowded every morning with not less than 20,000 persons, and what is
better, the Holy Spirit put life and power into the word.
In Oct. 1867, the Pastor having for several years been laid aside at
intervals by painful illness, and it having been stated by eminent
physicians that this was due to the over-straining of his mental powers,
the deacons and elders, after consulting together, recommended the
church to request
MR. J. A. SPURGEON
to become co-pastor with his brother, to relieve him of much of the
pastoral work. This happy arrangement was carried out Jan. 9, 1868,
and has been a great comfort to the senior pastor, both in church and
college work. Mr. James Spurgeon is now also the pastor of a large
and growing church in Croydon, for which he has erected a noble
chapel, where he is able to exercise his ministry on the Lord’s-day;
his help being mainly required at the Tabernacle upon week days, and
in the general oversight of the church. No more efficient or sympa-
thetic helper oould possibly have been found.
Here we may claim space to notice how much the church of late
years has been indebted to some of her departed workers ; for instance,
Deacon Thomas Cook, who superintended the work of collecting funds
for the New Tabernacle j to Elder Dransfield, one of the happiest and
most useful Christians in the world; and to Mrs. Bartlett, whose loss
we cannot cease to deplore, for she not only led hundreds of young
women to Jesus, but was also a pastor and mother to them. Among
those who are yet living there are some of the best and most gracious


of men and women, but it would be invidious to name some where so
many are doing their best. Yet, even at the risk of this evil, we must!
JAMES A. SPURGEON.
mention our Deacon William Olney, whose illness is a calamity to U 3
all, our Deacon W. C. Murrell, who for many years has borne all the


buffetings of the crowd at the doors and by the sacrifice of his own
personal comfort has enabled us to worship in peace and quietness.
To us the most noteworthy fact has been the increase of our member-
ship. Of this we subjoin a table.

From this it will be seen how steadily the process of addition to the
church has gone on even in those years in which the clear increase has
been small. Had we lost none we should now number 8,500. Emi-
grations and removals to other churches take from us so large a number
that it has in some years needed three persons to be added in the gross
to secure a permanent increase of one. Nor does this at all distress us;
it is well that it should be so. If the converts all remained in our
church the Tabernacle would not hold them, and there would certainly
be no room for the unconverted to come and hear; but now we pass
them on to other churches with pleasure, believing that they will be a
salt in the earth, and rejoicing that others are being drawn by the
Spirit to fill their places. We can hardly expect to increase beyond
5,000 as we have not sufficient seat room lor more than that number.
’ Out of these converts a very large number have become ministers,
colporteurs, and City missionaries, and of late the missionary spirit has
also been developed, so that quite a number of our friends have gone
forth among the heathen, to our great joy and rejoicing.
At this date (March, 1876) all is proceeding with regularity and life
under the divine smile. Our Deacons number nine, and our Elders
thirty-one. Mr. J. T. Dunn aids us in visitation and discipline, and
Mr. Charlesworth, the Head Master of the Orphanage, is also a great
assistance to us in conducting Bible Classes and public services.
The Sermons, published weekly, have now reached No. 1,284, and
the “Sword and Trowel” is in the 12th volume; the circulation of
both being well sustained.
We have almost completed the 22nd year of our pastorate, and
though we long to see greater things, yet we magnify the name of the
Lord as we hear the watchman cry “ All is well.”


CHAPTER IX. —“FATHER” OLNEY.
were several worthy men in the deacon’s office
when we first came to London ; but out of them all,
our friend, our counsellor, our right hand, was Thomas
rfMp Olney. Never minister had better deacon, never
church a better servant. He died in 1869, and at
Ss?this moment we miss him still, and so do hundreds of
tlie j ior( p s poor, to whom he was an incarnate
providence. In his house we first enjoyed hospitality when we came
to New Park Street, he sat in the pulpit with us at the Surrey Gardens
in order to communicate our wishes to those who kept order, and he so
frequently travelled with us that some jocose friend called him our
“ dry-nurse.” He was our model deacon, aud take him for all in all
we ne’er shall look upon his like again.
We know something about deacons, and all we know is to their
honour. Those of our first village ministry were the excellent of the
earth, in whom we took great delight. Since our sojourn in London we
have seen the last of a former race of deacons ; fine, gentlemanly men,
rather stiff and unmanageable, not quite to our mind, but respectable,
prudent grandees of Dissent, in semi-clerical dress, with white cravats.
Our present staff of deacons consists of peculiarly lovable, active,
energetic, warm-hearted, generous men ; but as we may hope to live
with them for another quarter of a century, we will only say of them
that we love them heartily and find them true yoke-fellows.
Thomas Olney, senior, has left us another Thomas Olney, Treasurer,
in the person of his son, and a William Olney, Deacon, who is greatly
beloved by us all, and is the daily subject of our earnest prayers that he
may be restored to health and spared to us for many years to come.
There is also another generation of Olneys springing up, one of whom
has already distinguished himself as a leading worker among us.
Thomas Olney was born at Tring, Nov. 10th, 1790. His father, Mr.
Daniel Olney, was for many years a deacon of the Baptist church in
that town. Thomas was sent to London, and apprenticed in the City to
a wholesale mercer. From his first entrance into London he attended
the ministry of Dr. Rippon, at Carter Lane. Here the Lord graciously
met with him and saved his soul. He was proposed as a candidate for
church fellowship, December, 1809, and remained for sixty years a
member of the church. He was accustomed, even in their earliest years,
to take his children to Carter Lane Chapel, having a little chair fixed
on the pew-seat for the youngest.


In 1817, an early Sabbath-morning lecture was commenced in
Carter Lane Chapel. To be at the service by half-past six o’clock, to
THOMAS OLNEY.
collect the necessary funds, and to welcome the various ministers, was
Mr. Olney’s great delight. ~ . , . , „ . . .
His closest friendships were formed within the circle ot the churcfi.


Not only did he say of the church, “Thy God shall be my God,” but
also, “ Thy people shall be my people.”
In 1829 Carter Lane Chapel became the property of the City, and
•was pulled down ; Dr. Rippon became old and feeble; the love of
many waxed cold, and they left the church in its hour of peril.
Not so Thomas Olney : he remained manfully with the church. He
was appointed a trustee for the chapel in New Park Street, opened in
1833. His much-loved pastor, Dr. Rippon, expired in his presence, it
might as properly be said in his arms. It was his privilege for some
months, by his care and kindness, to cheer the last days of his highly-
esteemed friend, towards whose memory he cherished till his last days
a most tender affection.
During all the time of erecting the new chapel in New Park Street,
Mr. Olney may be said to have “favoured the very dust of Zion.”
From foundation to top-stone he watched its progress with interest
and prayer. Prosperity was given under the ministry of Mr. James
Smith, and it was Mr. Olney’s happiness to see all his four sons
baptized and united to the church. In 1838, he was, together with his
friend Mr. Winsor, chosen deacon of the church. He faithfully served
in that office thirty-one years. He teas ever remarkable for his early and
constant attendance at the prayer-meeting, and other tveek-day services.
He loved the habitation of God’s house.
God had other mercies in store for him. His beloved Zion was
to rise and shine. By the providence of God, Deacon Olney had his
attention directed by his old friend, the late Mr. G. Gould, of Loughton,
to the present Pastor, under whom, through the divine blessing, the
church has grown and multiplied.
A new and far larger building was needed; a meeting in Mr. Olney’s
house commenced the undertaking, and the work after much pains and
prayer was accomplished. In 1855, “ Father Olney,” as he was play-
fully styled by Pastor and Deacons, was chosen treasurer of the church,
and by the help of his sons fulfilled the office, together with those of
Deacon and Elder, until his death.
He was treasurer fourteen years. “Of his love and devotion to
both the pastor and the church we all are witnesses.” His greatest
pride, we might almost use that word, was the work of God at the
Tabernacle. He gloried and rejoiced in all that concerned the church.
He loved college, orphanage, aiid almshouses, and helped them all to
the extent of his ability. His fellow officers in the deaconship shared
his esteem and love. And now that he has changed earthly for
heavenly service and joy, may his memory and example stir us all to
copy and follow him as far as he followed Christ.
Our departed friend had a childlike faith and a manly constancy. To
believe in Jesus and to work for him were the very life of his new and
better nature. He was eminently a Baptist, but he was also a lover of all
good men. The poor, and especially the poor of the church, always
found in him sincere sympathy and help. His name will be had in
lasting remembrance.


CHAPTER X.—INTERNAL CONDITION IN 1869.
HE Sword and the Trowel for February, 1869, contains
| a paper which conveys a better idea of the condition
wol *k our c^ that period than anything
fresh which we are able to write. In almost all
respects it accurately describes the present (1876),
tbut as that part which relates to the ivork of the
church is much changed we have omitted it.
DISCIPLINE OF THE CHURCH AT THE METROPOLITAN
TABERNACLE.
BY J. A. SPURGEON.
The subject of the paper is the discipline of the church at the Metro-
politan Tabernacle. This particular example has been selected because
with it the writer is more familiar than with any other. It is, moreover,
the discipline of one of our oldest churches, and not the least success-
ful of them, and it has been thought that there are elements of peculiar
interest connected with it which it would be useful to enumerate.
We are anxious to disclaim, at the outset, any pretensions to perfection
in our methods of action —we have found them work best for ourselves
hitherto, but we are always anxious to find out a more excellent way.
Our plans have been the outgrowth of necessity, not of theory ; they
were not sketched on paper and then carried out as an experiment, but
the circumstances of the church drove us to our present methods, and
we hope we have seen a line of scriptural precedent justifying our obe-
dience to providential indications. We should regret exceedingly if for
a moment it were supposed that we would recommend absolute uni-
formity in the methods of discipline adopted by churches : but to our
minds thus much is clear, that the congregational churches, both Baptist
and Pmdobaptist, have gone as far in the direction of diversity as pos-
sible, and weakness rather than strength has been the result. That no
room should be left for the different peculiarities of pastor and people,
but all be bound to one undeviating standard of action, would be to
cramp, and not to benefit; but, on the other hand, that so few points
of agreement should be accepted as a common basis of action, sustaining
a sense of confidence in each other’s discipline, is little short of a
calamity. Mutual confidence arising from known adequate, though it
may be at times dissimilar, courses of action, leading up to one result,
must be a source of blessing to any denomination ; and at present wc
frankly admit, as the result of a somewhat wide observation of the


methods of receiving, and the all but uniform want of method in remov-
ing, names from our church rolls, we have but small faith in eccle-
siastical statistics, and what is worse, a limited confidence in letters
of commendation from our churches. That we may all find room for
improvement is undoubted, and that we may at once make the dis-
covery and act upon it, is the object and prayer of the writer of this
paper.
We remark at once that at the Tabernacle ive have no written code of
laivs but the Book of Inspiration, and we unhesitatingly assert that all
such printed rules as some have desired, and others adopted, are only
fetters at the best of times, and snares and traps in periods of dispute
and difficulty. We have faith in sanctified common sense, resulting
from an application to the source of all wisdom by prayer and reading
the Scriptures. If churches would only act with the prudence of
assemblies of mercantile men, much evil would be averted, and more good
secured Acting in things temporal after a truly business principle,
and in things spiritual as God’s word and Spirit dictate, no formal sys-
tem of lules, in our opinion, will ever be required. Certain recognised
courses of procedure, from which, without cause assigned, no deviation
shall be made, are certainly necessary for mutual co-operation and peace
in any church ; but for emergencies, special action should be adopted to
suit the exigencies of the case, and no rales or traditions must forbid the
course which wisdom suggests, even though it should be contrary to all
the precedents of the previous history of the church. A general under-
standing of leading principles, and an elastic interpretation of them
as cases may require, will be all the rule outside of the Scripture required
in churches where confidence abounds between pastors, officers, and
members ; if this be wanting, no rules, human or divine, can make them
work harmoniously together. We must have faith in each other’s inten-
tioiis and integrity, or we shall loosen the pins of church action, and
all will lapse into confusion and conflict.
I. Church Officers.
Principles of action however clear, and methods of procedure how-
ever established by custom, will be of little avail if they be not sustained
by a vigorous executive. Amongst the officers of the church, foremost
stands the Pastor, who, though its servant, is so to rule, guide and dis-
cipline it as God shall help and direct by his Holy Spirit In connec-
tion with the church at the Tabernacle, two such officers are now
labouring. It is a trite remark that if two men ride a horse one must
sit behind, and he who is in the front must hold the reins and drive.
Co-pastorship3 have been sources of discomfort or blessing as this
principle has been understood. Wherever it may have been disre
garded, it is not (by the grace of God) likely to be so in the case in
hand. W here one of the two brothers has been so instrumental in
creating the necessity for additional help, from the very fulness of
blessing resulting from his labours; and is, moreover, so superior in
talent, influence, and power,* it is a privilege to follow in the order of

nature and birth which God. from the first, had evidently designed
The discipline of the church thus emanates from a common centie, acting
through recognised division of labour. All meetings and institutions
are subject to the influence, and when required to the action of the
Pastorate. It would be, at least, unseemly to have a
band of Christians. Sunday-school, college, orphanage, almshouses,
psalmody, are all under the supervision of a common headship, so as to
prevent inevitable confusion, if not conflict, as the result of
divided action. The leader of the church should surely lari- the
church’s work. Strife without measure has arisen from rival author-
ities disputing about the boundaries of their little empires. 1 e
spirit of peace has kept us from this evil, but a judicious arrangeme
has been in producing the result. There are 8t ' otr ®P^ eB
the present age—men loving to have the pre-eminence but it s
of the minister to magnify his office, and rule evenAhese whi
is best done, not by assertions of power or complaints of wa
influence, but by possessing such personal weight of piety and pru
dence, zeal, godliness, gentleness, and forbearance as wdl 'nevitalfly
place him in the front in course of time. In the long run, the
measure of any man’s power and influence is the measure m which
he deserves to possess them ; and no man is entitled to expect any
more. It is quite certain that no efforts to assert official dignity, when
sound judgment and weight of character are wanting, will ever result
in anything short of failure and contempt. We have known some
whose claims for deference and respect were in the inverse ratio to their
deserts; and the only outgrowth of their pnestlyism was to rum and
break up every church they attempted to guide and control How much
we need the wisdom of the serpent with the harmlessness of the dove *
How gently as a nurse among her children, should the pastor behave
himseff! With what unassuming brotherly love, and paternal, wisdom,
should he hold intercourse with his people! True pastors must be both
made and born; and day by day must they be sustained or then
will be a shame to themselves and a burden to their flocks. I rom tti s
inav the Lord keep his servants evermore. ... . 1 v •
Deacons and Elders.- After the Pastor, and labouring by his side,
we need brethren qualified of God to be helpers ot our joy. In this
church two offices distinct in main points, though often coincident in
others, are recognised, and, as we think, with both Smptnre and Common
sense upon our side. It may and does often happen that the man or
judgment, prudent in counsel, and skilled in money matters, is not
gifted with speech so as to lead devotional exercises | n e
nraver- meeting or beside the bed of sickness, or mthe house ot mourn
ing A good man for things temporal, in dealing with worldly matters,
may not be an elder apt to teach and to exhor . lacking in
a man may have all the qualifications of an of
such abilities as are required for the serving of tables, the disposi g
finances, and the securing of needed funds lor the chuic .
Our Deacons, nine in number, are elected by the church at the sug-
gestion of the Pastor, after consultation with the previously elected
deacons. It is open to any member to nominate p
such an election, but in no case has the recommendation of the lastor


and Deacons been dissented from, for the brethren nominated were in
every way called and qualified of the Lord. They are chosen for life :
t us having been the usual custom in such cases ; and there beino - no
strong reason for a change in the rule. Their duties are to care for the
ministry, and help the poor of the church, to regulate the finances and
take charge of the church’s property, seeing to the order and comfort
ot all worshipping in the place. The work is divided so as to secure
the services of all, and prevent the neglect of anything through un-
certainty as to the person responsible for its performance. One
honoured brother is generally treasurer, and has been so for many years—
long may he be spared to us ; another takes all out-door work, repairs
keeping the gates, appointing door-keepers, etc.; a third attends to the
relier of the poor, and a fourth as a good steward sees to the arrange
ment and provision of the Lord’s table ; thus with a common council
we have separate duties. At every remembrance of these brethren we
thank bod. Some ministers have found their trials in their deacons •
it is but right to say that we find in them our greatest comfort, and w
earnestiy desire that every church should share in an equal blessino-
aiders Our eldership, now sustained by twenty-six brethren is
source of much blessing to our church. Without the efficient and self
denying labours of the Elders we should never be able to supervise ou
huge church, containing at the close of the year 1868, 3,860 members
and from which, under the present pastor, about an equal number have
gone to the church triumphant, or to other parts of the churcl
militant.
The Elders are re-elected annually, but usually continue for life in their
office ; fresh Elders are proposed by the Pastor to the already elected
blders, c.nd after some time has been given for thought, the subject o:‘
the propriety of their election is discussed at an Elders’ meeting and if
recommended with general unanimity, the names are then laid before
the church by the Pastor, and, after opportunity given for the ex-
pression of opinion, the vote of the church is taken. We offer no
° l) !, 5”! aS fc< ? ofcher methods of electing church officers, but we
will add that no other plan commends itself so much to our judgment •
no other plan is so safe for our church, or so likely to procure good
officers; no other plan is so helpful to the Pastor, who is most con-
cerned in the choice, having to work with those selected ; and no other
plan as we can see will enable him so faithfully to discharge his office
of guide and shepherd, in one of the most critical periods of the
church s history. Timidity here is a crime, and the affectation of
modesty in not wishing to influence the church is to our mind
dereliction of duty. A church possessed of unlimited liberty of action
needs, for the sake of its junior and less instructed members to be'
directed m its choice of officers—the best men to do it are the pastor and
officers already tried and proved, and the fear of giving offence seems
to us but the fear of man which bringeth a snare.
To the Elders is committed the spiritual oversight of the church, and
such ol its concerns as are not assigned to the Deacons nor belong to
TnET*'; Biemg 8 i emg ° f en( l uirers ’ the visiting of candidates for
chuich membership, the seeking out of absentees, the caring for the
sic and troubled, the conducting of prayer-meetings, catechumen and

Bible-classes for the young men—these and other needed offices onr
brethren the Elders discharge for the church. One Elder is maintained
by the church for the especial purpose of visiting our sick poor, and
looking after the church-roll, that this may be done regularly and effi-
ciently! As a whole we cheerfully bear our testimony to the beneficial
working of the system of deaconate and eldership as distinct offices.
Both works are in a few cases performed by the same person, but the
existence of the two bodies of men is in a thousand ways a great
assistance to good government.
Church Membership.
All persons anxious to join our church are requested to apply
personally upon any Wednesday evening, between six and nine
o’clock, to the elders, two or more of whom attend m rotation every
week for the purpose of seeing enquirers. When satisfied, the case is
entered by the elder in one of a set of books provided lor the purpose,
and a card is given bearing a corresponding number to the page ot
the book in which particulars of the candidate’s experience are re-
corded. Once a month, or oftener when required the junior pastor
appoints a day to see the persons thus approved of by the elders. It
the pastor is satisfied, he nominates an elder or church member as
visitor, and at the next church meeting asks the church to send him to
enquire as to the moral character and repute of the candidate, it the
visitor be satisfied he requests the candidate to attend with him at the
following or next convenient church meeting-, to come before the church
and reply to such questions as may be put from the chair, mainly with
a view to elicit expressions of his trust in the Lord Jesus, and hope of
salvation through his blood, and any such facts of his spiritual history
as may convince the church of the genuineness of the case. We have
found this a means of grace and a rich blessing. iSi one need apprehend
that modesty is outraged, or timidity appalled by the test thus applied.
We have never yet found it tend to keep members out of our inidst,
while we have known it of service in detecting a mistake or satisfying
a doubt previously entertained. We deny that it keeps away any worth
having Surely if their Christianity cannot stand before a body ot
believers, and speak amongst loving, sympathising hearts, it is as well
to ask if it be the cross-bearing public confessing faith ot the Bible .
This is no matter of flesh and blood, but of faith and grace, and we
should be sorry to give place to the weakness and shrinking of the flesh,
so as to insult the omnipotence of grace, by deeming it unable to endure
so much as the telling in the gates of Zion what great things God has
done for the soul. Of course, the system may be, and has been, abused
but we decline to recognise any argument drawn from the abuse ot
what we use lawfully. After the statement before the church the
candidate withdraws, the visitor gives in his report, and the vote of
the church is taken ; when the candidate has professed his faith by
immersion, which is administered by the junior pastor, after a week-day
service, he is received by the pastor at the first monthly communion,
when the right-hand of fellowship is given to him in the name of the
church and his name is entered on the roll of members. A communion
card is furnished, divided by perforation into twelve numbered parts,


one of which is to he delivered every month at the communion, which
is held every Lord’s-day ; the tickets are checked upon the register, and
thus show the attendance of each member at the communion. If a
member is absent more than three months without any known cause,
the elder in whose district he resides is requested to visit him, and send
in a report on a printed form which is given him ; or if the residence
be distant, a letter is written, a record of such visit or letter being
retained. When a case for discipline presents itself, it is brought before
the elders, who appoint one of their number to visit and report ; if the
matter demands action beyond caution and advice, we lay it before the
church, and recommend the course of procedure to be adopted, whether
censure or excommunication.
In dealing with such as are members of other churches, we have
been by sad experience compelled to exercise more caution than at
first seemed needful. The plan we adopt is to have the person seen by
an elder, who enters particulars in the transfer book. If there appears
to be any difficulty, an interview is arranged with one of the pastors
who investigates the case on its own merits, as, alas ! he has discovered
that membership with some churches is not always a guarantee even of
morality. Some churches retain a name upon their books for years after
the pei’son has ceased to commune ; and frequently when he has passed
away from all knowledge of, or connection with the church, it will
nevertheless grant a transfer as if all were satisfactory. We record
this with mingled shame and sorrow. When the individual has thus
given evidence of fitness, so far as we can judge, a dismissal is applied
for in the usual way, and the reply is laid before the church, any infor-
mation necessary is added, and the vote of the church taken.
When, in the order of God’s providence, any of our number are re-
moved from us, and are not able to attend, a certificate is given for three,
six, or twelve months, which must then be renewed, and a report of the
reason for renewal given, or the membership will lapse, unless in special
cases. We much prefer commending our brethren to the fellowship of
other churches, where they may be of service, than to have them linger
out a merely nominal connection with us. We have thus sent from us
166 in the course of last year, we hope to the strengthening of the
churches and the spread of the truth.
On receipt of application from any church for the transfer of a mem-
ber, a letter is read to the church, with the detailed account from our
books, giving a brief but complete history of the case, when and how
received, the attendance of the person while a member with us, and
reasons for seeking removal. The church is then advised to authorize
the usual letter of dismission to be sent.
In all our business the aim is to have everything done openly and
above-board, so that no one may complain of the existence of a clique,
or the suppression of the true state of affairs. We occasionally ask
the unquestioning confidence of the church in its officers in cases
delicate and undesirable to be published, but otherwise we consult the
church in everything, and report progress as often as possible in all
matters still pending and unsettled. Nothing, we are persuaded, is so
sure to create suspicion and destroy confidence as attempts at secret
diplomacy, or mere official action.


When details of cases under discipline are kept from the church, the
fact is openly stated, and leave asked for the maintenance of such
public reticence ; while any member is informed that, if dissatisfied,
the pastor will give him the reasons why the elders have advised the
removal of the offender, and their motive in not giving details of the
sin. When it would be for the injury of good morals, or expose the
pastor to a suit-at-law, the officers ask the confidence of the church,
and request it to adopt their verdict in the case without hearing
detailed information ; this is cheerfully accorded in every case, and
much evil is thus averted.
All money matters are audited by unofficial brethren selected by the
church, and the accounts read and books produced at the annual
church meeting, when all the members endeavour to be present.
All minutes of church meetings, deacons’ and elders’ courts, are
entered, and confirmed at the following meeting, Unless notice is pre-
viously given, no business, as a rule, is entertained in the church meet-
ing, except it emanates from the chair, or is sent up from an elders’
session ; though this custom is departed from if any manifest benefit
is to be derived from so doing, and no one challenges the motion as
irregular.
In conclusion, we feel bound to acknowledge that our dependence
for prosperity and peace is solely upon the God who commands the
dew of his grace to descend upon his church. All our springs are in
him ; no under-shepherd’s care, not the best built and guarded fold,
can ever keep out the wolf in sheep’s clothing, nor the enemy so watch-
ful and relentless, who goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he
may devour. Our help cometh from the Lord who made heaven and
earth. The discipline of the closet and the prayer meeting, of close
fellowship with God in secret, will bring the reward openly. Nothing
in the shape of rules or customs, no, not even the devoted services of
apostles themselves, can compensate for low-toned piety on the part of
the members. Whence come wars and fightings—is it not because many
professors are still carnal, and walk not after the Spirit? Drawing
nearer and nearer to the centre and source of all grace and blessing
will inevitably result in our being “ one ” to the glory of God the
Father. We must raise our standard of individual and personal piety,
and to that extent we shall destroy elements of evil. If thorns can
spring up and choke the good seed, the same law may, if rightly turned
upon the foe, destroy roots of bitterness which, springing up, would
trouble us, by occupying the ground with the “fruits of the Spirit,
which are love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
meekness, temperance —against such there is no law.”
“ Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present
you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the
only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power,
both now and for ever. Amen.”


CHAPTER XI.—THE ALMSHOUSES.
HEN we built the Tabernacle we looked upon New Park
Street Chapel as a property which we would endeavour
to re toin f° r toe Baptist denomination, and we desired if
MW|r\rl possible to make it the abode of another church. For
Hni some years preaching was carried on, a brother sup-
ported, and considerable expenses incurred, but it was
c i ear that a self-sustaining interest was not to be
gathered in the.neighbourhood. Mr. J. Collins, now of Penge, worked
very hard, and enjoyed much of the divine blessing, but those who were
converted under him had a pardonable tendency to gravitate towards the
mother church at the Tabernacle, and it became evident beyond all
question that it was useless for us to retain so large a building in such a
situation and so near our own. The property consisted of the chapel,
schools, and almsrooms, and it was agreed, and arranged with the
Charity Commissioners, that it should be sold, and the proceeds used
for new schools and almsrooms. The inmates of the rooms greatly
rejoiced at the prospect of coming nearer the Tabernacle and dwelling
in a place where fresh air would be obtainable.
A site was purchased near the Elephant and Castle Railway Station, —
the buildings can be seen when the train stops at the station. The
first stone was laid by Deacon Thomas Olney, May 6th, 1867, and the
friends were requested to contribute about £I,OOO, which would be
needed over and above the moneys in hand. This they did very
promptly, but when the buildings were finished it was found that some
£750 more would be needed to cover the extras which had been found
necessary during the progress of the works. The pastor announced
this fact one Sabbath morning, and also his determination that the
institution should remain unoccupied till all was paid for; he also
mentioned donations which would be given by himself, Deacons Olney
and Higgs, and a friend, whereupon the congregation by collections that
day made up the rest, so that no debt came upon the new establish-
ment. This cardinal rule of avoiding all debt has been the means of
great strength to us. People do not pay for things after they have them
with half the readiness with which they subscribe to purchase them.
Besides, the scriptural rule is “ Owe no man anything.”
There are seventeen almsrooms, two schoolrooms, and a classroom,
which are occupied by 380 children on week-days, and there is also a
house for the schoolmaster. At the present time a Sabbath school,
special children’s service, and an evangelistic meeting, with many other


good works are in earnest operation at the place, including most of the
usual machinery connected with places of worship.
Members of the church, being women above the age of sixty, and
needing support, are eligible to become occupants of the rooms. They
are generally chosen according to their number on the church-book and
the urgency of the case. One of the inmates, Miss Fanny Gay, is in
her 87th year, and has been a member of the church 69 years. She is
an eminently devout, prudent, godly woman, and in past years rendered
eminent service by her conversations with young women who needed
instruction or comfort. It is a joy to provide a resting place for her
and the other aged sisters.
The original endowments, after the payment of repairs, do not
suffice wholly to provide for six inmates, and there are now seventeen ;
the support of the remaining eleven involves a heavy draught upon the
communion fund of our church, which is already fully weighted with
poor members. We greatly need at least £SOOO to endow
THE ALMHOUSES, AND PLACE THE INSTITUTION UPON A PROPER FOOT-
ING. Already C. H. Spurgeon, Thomas Olney, and Thomas Greenwood
have contributed £2OO each towards the fund, and we earnestly
trust that either by donations or legacies the rest of the £SOOO will be
forthcoming. This would only provide five shillings per week for
each poor woman, which is little enough. If more could be raised it
would be so much the better for the pensioners. The Pastors are
anxious to see this matter put into proper order; they confess that the
responsibility of having increased the number of rooms and almswomen rests
mainly with them , and , therefore , they feel that their ivork is not done till at
least five shillings per week shall have been provided for their poor sisters:
if it could be double that amount they would be glad. We wish to leave
the Tabernacle in good working order when our work is done ; but the
present burden might prove far too heavy for our successors, indeed,
they ought not to be saddled with it. In future years the church
may find itself barely able to support its own expenses, and we do
not think that we are justified in leaving it the legacy of so heavy a
charge. Our present anxiety is to get the ship tight and trim, and
this is one of the matters which is not in a satisfactory condition.
Brethren, let us set it straight.
Our aged sisters are worthy of all that we can do for them, and their
grateful faces often make our heart glad. We should like to see more
almsrooms, and we hope someone will build and endow a row for aged
men. We have had a hint that this project is taking shape in the
mind of a generous friend: we hope he will carry it out in his own life-
time, rather than wait to have it done by a legacy.
Over the door of the girls’ school is the following inscription :
“These Buildings are connected with the ancient church

In our engraving the schoolrooms are on the right, and the master’s
house is on the left ; the almsrooms are in the houses between. The
day schools are self-supporting, but there are no funds to pay the
expenses of the other operations here carried on. The pastor generally
has to pay for the gas, firing, &c. from his own pocket, as the endow-
ments are so scanty.

The investments now belonging to the almshouse trustees are,
£•2950 reduced Consols, standing in different names ; £4OO Great
Western Guaranteed 5 per cent. Stock, presented by Mr. T. Olney
and Mr. C. H. Spurgeon ; and £2OO Buenos Ayres Stock given by
Mr. Greenwood: they receive also £2O per annum as the rent of a
small piece of ground and a hoarding for advertisements. Part of the
principal endowment was left for repairs. We hope that in later
editions of this history we shall be able to cancel this page, and
announce that the almshouses are amply provided for.


CHAPTER XII.—THE PASTORS’ COLLEGE.
College was the first important institution com-
by the Pastor, and it still remains his firstborn
ar) d best beloved. To t ra i n ministers of the gospel is
a exce^en t work, and when the Holy Spirit
bosses the effort the result is of the utmost importance
both to the church and to the world.
In the year 1870 we printed an account of the
College, which we present to the reader as the best history we can
furnish up to that date.
“The Pastors’ College (commenced in 1856) has now entered on its
fourteenth year, and during this long period has unceasingly been re-
membered of the God of heaven, to whom all engaged in it offer
reverent thanksgiving. When it was commenced I had not even a
remote idea of whereunto it would grow. There were springing up
around me, as my own spiritual children, many earnest young men who
felt an irresistible impulse to preach the gospel, and yet with half an
eye it could be their want of education would be a sad hin-
drance to them. It was not in my heart to bid them cease their preach-
ing, and, had I done so, they would, in all probability, have ignored my
recommendation. As it seemed that preach they would, though their
attainments were very slender, no other course was open but to give
them an opportunity to educate themselves for the work.
“The Holy Spirit very evidently had set his seal upon the work
of one of.them (Mr. T. W. Medhurst, now of Landport) by con-
versions wrought under his open-air addresses: it seemed therefore to
be a plain matter of duty to instruct this youthful Apollos still fur-
ther, that he might be fitted for wider usefulness. No college at that
time appeared to me to be suitable for the class of men that the provi-
dence and grace of God drew around me. They were mostly poor, and
most of the colleges involved necessarily a considerable outlay to the
student; for even where the education was free, books, clothes, and
other incidental expenses required a considerable sum per annum.
Moreover, it must be frankly admitted that my views of the gospel
and of the mode of training preachers were and are somewhat peculiar.
I may have been uncharitable in my judgment, but I thought the
Calvinism of the theology usually taught to be very doubtful, and
the fervour of the generality of the students to be far behind their
literary attainments. It seemed to me that preachers of the grand old
truths of the gospel, ministers suitable for the masses, were more likely


to be found in an institution where preaching and divinity would be
the main objects, and not degrees and other insignia of human
learning. I felt that without interfering with the laudable objects of
other colleges, I could do good in my own way. These and other con-
siderations led me to take a few tried young men, and to put them
under some able minister that he might train them in the Scriptures,
and in other knowledge helpful to the understanding and proclamation
of the truth. This step appeared plain, but how the work was to be
conducted and supported was the question —a question, be it added,
solved almost before it occurred.
“Two friends, Mr. Winsor and Mr. W. Olney, both deacons of the
church, promised aid, which, with what I could give myself, enabled
me to take one student, and I set about to find a tutor. In Mr.
George Rogers, then the pastor of the Independent Church, Albany
Road, Camberwell, God sent us the very best man. He had been pre-
paring for such work, and was anxiously waiting for it. This gentleman,
who has remained during all this period our principal tutor, is a man of
Puritanic stamp, deeply learned, orthodox in doctrine, judicious, witty,
devout, earnest, liberal in spirit, and withal juvenile in heart to an
extent most remarkable in one of his years. My connection with him
has been one of uninterrupted comfort and delight. The most sincere
affection exists between us, we are of one mind and of one heart, and
what is equally important, he has in every case secured not merely the
respect but the filial love of every student. Into this beloved minister’s
house the first students were introduced, and for a considerable period
they were domiciled as members of his family.
“ Encouraged by the readiness with which the young men found
spheres of labour, and by their singular success in soul-winning, I
enlarged the number, but the whole means of sustaining them came
from my own purse. The large sale of my sermons in America, to-
gether with my dear wife’s economy, enabled me to spend from £6OO
to £BOO in a year in my own favourite work ; but on a sudden, owing
to my denunciations of the then existing slavery in the States, my
entire resources from that “brook Cherith” were dried up. I paid as
large sums as I could from my own income, and resolved to spend all
I had, and then take the cessation of my means as a voice from the
Lord to stay the effort, as I am firmly persuaded that we Ought under no
pretence to go into debt. On one occasion I proposed the sale of my
horse and carriage, although these were almost absolute necessaries to
me on account of my continual journeys in preaching the A\ ord. I his
my friend Mr. Rogers would not hear of, and actually offered to be the
loser rather than this should be done. Then it was that I told my
difficulties to my people, and the Weekly Offering commenced, but the
incomings from that source w T ere so meagre as to be hardly worth
calculating upon. I was brought to the last pound, when a letter
came from a banker in the City, informing me that a lady, whose name
I have never been able to discover, had deposited a sum ot £2OO,
to be used for the education of young men for the ministry. How
did my heart leap for joy ! I threw myself then and henceforth upon
the bounteous care of the Lord, whom I desired with my whole heait
to glorify by this effort. Some weeks after, another £IOO came in


from the same bank, as I was informed, from another hand. Soon
after, Mr. Phillips, a beloved deacon of the church at the Tabernacle,
GEORGE ROGERS.
began to provide an annual supper for the friends of the College, at
which considerable sums have from year to year been given. A dinner


was also given by my liberal publishers, Messrs. Passmore and
Alabaster, to celebrate the publishing of my five hundredth weekly
sermon, at which £SOO were raised and presented to the funds. The
College grew every month, and the number of students rapidly ad-
vanced from one to forty. Friends known and unknown, from far and
near, were moved to give little or much to my work, and so the funds
increased as the need enlarged. Then another earnest deacon of the
church, Mr. Murrell, espoused as his special work the weekly offering,
and by the unanimous voice of the church under my care the College
was adopted as its own child. Since that hour the weekly offering has
been a steady source of income, till in the year 1869 the amount
reached exactly £1869. .
“ There have been during this period times of great trial of my faith;
but after a season of straitness, never amounting to absolute want, the
Lord has always interposed and sent me large sums (on one occasion
£1000) from unknown donors. When the Orphanage was thrust upon
me, it did appear likely that this second work would drain the resources
of the first, and it is very apparent that it does attract to itself some
of the visible sources of supply, but my faith is firm that the Lord
can as readily keep both works in action as one. My own present
inability to do so much, by way of preaching abroad, occasions naturally
the failure of another great source of income; and as my increasing
labours at home will in all probability diminish that stream in per-
petuity, there is another trial of faith. Yet, if the Lord wills the
work to be continued, he will send his servant a due portion of the
o-old and silver, which are all his own; and therefore as I wait upon
him in prayer, the all-sufficient Provider will supply all my needs.
About £5,000 is annually required for the College, and the same sum
is needed for the Orphanage, but God will move his people to liberality,
and we shall see greater things than these.
“ While speaking of pecuniary matters, it may be well to add, that as
many of the young men trained in the college have raised new con-
gregations, and gathered fresh churches, another need. has arisen
namely, money for building chapels. It is ever so in Christ s work, one
link draws on another, one effort makes another needed. For chapel-
building, the College funds could do but little, though they have freely
been used to support men while they are collecting congregations ; but
the Lord found for me one of his stewards, who on the condition that
his name remains unknown, has hitherto, as the Lord has prospered
him supplied very princely amounts for the erection of places of wor-
ship, of which more than forty have been built, or so greatly renovated
and enlarged, as to be virtually new structures. Tiuly may it be said,
‘ What hath God wrought! ’ .
“ Pecuniary needs, however, have made up but a small part of our
cares. Many have been my personal exercises in selecting the men.
Candidates have always been plentiful, and the choice has been wide,
but it is a serious responsibility to reject any, and yet more to accept
them for training. When mistakes have been made, a second buiden
has been laid upon me in the dismissal of those who appeared to be
unfit. Even with the most careful management, and all the assist-
ance of tutors and friends, no human foresight can secure that in


every case a man shall be what we believed and hoped. A brother
may be exceedingly useful as an occasional preacher, he may distinguish
himself as a diligent student, he may succeed at first in the ministry,
and yet, when trials of temper and character occur in the pastorate,
he may be found wanting. We have had comparatively few causes for
regret of this sort, but there have been some such, and these pierce us
with many sorrows. I devoutly bless God that he has sent to the
College some of the holiest, soundest, and most self-denying preachers
I know, and I pray that he may continue to do so; but it would be
more than a miracle if all should excel. While thus speaking of
trials connected with the men themselves, it is due to our gra-
cious God to bear testimony that these have been comparatively
light, and are not worthy to be compared with the great joy
which we experience in seeing no less than two hundred and seven
brethren still serving the Lord according to their measure of gift, and
all it is believed earnestly contending for the faith once delivered unto
the saints ; nor is the joy less in remembering that eleven have sweetly
fallen asleep after having fought a good fight. At this hour some of
our most flourishing Baptist churches are presided over by pastors
trained in our College, and as years shall add ripeness of experience
and stability of character, others will be found to stand in the front
rank of the Lord’s host.
“ The young brethren are boarded generally in twos and threes, in the
houses of our friends around the Tabernacle, for which the College pays
a moderate weekly amount. The plan of separate lodging we believe
to be far preferable to having all under one roof; for, by the latter mode,
men are isolated from general family habits, and are too apt to fall
into superabundant levity. The circumstances of the families who
entertain our young friends are generally such that they are not
elevated above the social position which in all probability they will
have to occupy in future years, but are kept in connection with the
struggles and conditions of every-day life.
“ Devotional habits are cultivated to the utmost, and the students
are urged to do as much evangelistic work as they can. The severe
pressure put upon them to make the short term as useful as possible,
leaves small leisure for such efforts, but this is in most instances faith-
fully economised. Although our usual period is two years, whenever it
is thought right the term of study is lengthened to three or four years ;
indeed, there is no fixed rule, all arrangements being ordered by the
circumstances and attainments of each individual.
“As before hinted, our numbers have greatly grown, and now range
from eighty to one hundred. Very promising men, who are suddenly
thrown in our way, are received at any time, and others who are selected
from the main body of applicants come in at the commencement of
terms. The church at the Tabernacle continues to furnish a
large quota of men, and as these have usually been educated
for two or more years in our Evening Classes, they are more ad-
vanced and better able to profit by our two years of study. We
have no difficulty in finding spheres for men who are ready and
fitted for them. There is no reason to believe that the supply
of trained ministers is in advance of the demand. Even on the


lowest ground of consideration, there is yet very much land to be
possessed ; and when men break up fresh soil, as ours are encouraged to
do, the field is the world, and the prayer for more labourers is daily more
urgent. If the Lord would but send us funds commensurate, there are
hundreds of neighbourhoods needing the pure gospel, which we could
by his grace change from deserts into gardens. How far this is a call
upon the reader let him judge as in the sight of God. Shall there be
the gifts and graces of the Spirit given to the church, and shall there
not also be sufficient bestowed of the earthly treasure ? How much
owest thou unto my Lord ?
“ The College was for some little time aided by the zealous services of
Mr. W. Cubitt, of Thrapstone, who died among us, enjoying our highest
esteem. Mr. Gracey, the classical tutor, a most able brother, is one of
ourselves, and was in former years a student, though from possessing a
solid education, he needed little instruction from us except in theology.
In him we have one of the most efficient tutors living, a man fitted for
any post requiring thorough scholarship, and aptness in communicating
knowledge. Mr. Fergusson, in the English elementary classes, does the
first work upon the rough stones of the quarry, and we have heard from
the men whom he has taught in the evening classes speeches and addresses
which would have adorned any assembly, proving to demonstration his
ability to cope with the difficulties of uncultured and ignorant minds.
Mr. Johnson, who zealously aids in the evening, is also a brother
precisely suited to the post which he occupies. These evening classes
afford an opportunity to Christian men engaged during the day to
obtain an education for nothing during their leisure time, and very
many avail themselves of the privilege. Nor must I forget to mention
Mr. Selway, who takes the department of physical science, and by his
interesting experiments and lucid descriptions, gives to his listeners an
introduction to those departments of knowledge which most abound
with illustrations. Last, but far from least, I adore the goodness of
God which sent me so dear and efficient a fellow-helper as my brother
in the flesh and in the Lord, J. A. Spurgeon. His work has greatly
relieved me of anxiety, and his superior educational qualifications have
tended to raise the tone of the instruction given.
“ As to the quality of the preachers whom we have been enabled to
send forth, w r e need no more impartial witness than the good Earl of
Shaftesbury, who was kind enough to express himself publicly in
Finsbury Chapel, April 4, 1870, in the following generous terms
“ ‘ It was an utter fallacy to suppose that the people of England would
ever be brought to a sense of order and discipline by the repetition of
miserable services, by bits of wax candle, by rags of Popery, and by
gymnastics in the chancel: nothing was adapted to meet the wants of
the people but the Gospel message brought home to their hearts, and
he knew of none who had done better service in this evangelistic work
than the pupils trained in Mr. Spurgeon’s College. They had a singular
faculty for addressing the population, and going to the very heart of the
people.’
“ Those who measure effort by result, will be gratified to learn that
during the last five years our statistics show that the churches under
the care of our young pastors have received a clear increase of ten


thousand members. How much of divine power and grace 'this fact
reveals eternity alone can disclose. Had we reckoned in earlier years
we should have seen equal proportionate success; and it is no small
matter for congratulation that the stricter examination of results which
we have carried out of late manifests such a satisfactory total.
THE PASTORS’ COLLEGE.
“ Each year the brethren educated at the Pastors’ College are invited
to meet in conference at the Tabernacle, and they are generously enter-
tained by our friends. The week is spent in holy fellowship, prayer,
and intercourse. By this means men in remote villages, labouring
under discouraging circumstances, and ready to sink from loneliness ot
spirit, are encouraged and strengthened : indeed, all the men confess
that a stimulus is thus given which no other means could confer. The
Conference of 1870 was regarded by all as a visitation of the Holy
Spirit, and the brethren returned to their labour full of zeal and hope.
“All things considered, gratitude and hope are supreme in connection
with the Pastors’ College, and with praise to God and thanks to a
thousand friends, the president and his helpers gird up the loins ol
their minds for yet more abundant labours in the future. To every land
we hope yet to send forth the gospel in its fulness and purity. We
pray the Lord to raise up missionaries among our students and make
every one a winner of souls. Brethren, remember this work in your
prayers, and in your allotment of the Lord's portion of your substance .”
Since the above article was written the College has removed from the
dark, subterranean rooms under the Tabernacle, into the most convenient.


suitable, and commodious new buildings, which have been erected and
furnished at the cost of about £15,000, all of which is paid. Here
we have a fine hall, excellent class-rooms, a handsome library, and in
fact all that a College can require. The way in which the money was
raised was another instance of divine goodness. £3,000 was given as a
memorial to a dear and lamented husband. £2,000 was a legacy to the
College from a reader of the sermons. The ministers who had been
formerly students came to our help in a princely fashion. Large
amounts were made up by the unanimous offerings of Tabernacle
friends, on days when the Pastor invited the members and adherents
to be his guests at the College. In answer to prayer, the gold and
the silver have been ready when needed. How our heart exults and
blesses the name of the Lord.
At the present moment (1876) the Evening Classes are in a high con-
dition of prosperity, there being about 200 men in regular attendance,
and a considerable number among them of hopeful ability. Out of this
class City-missionaries, lay preachers, writers for the press, and colpor-
teurs, are continually coming. It is an eminently useful part of the
College work. These classes have a Loan Library, and contributions
of really good, useful books will be gratefully acknowledged.
There are now 330 men proclaiming the gospel in connection with
the Baptist denomination who have been trained in the College, of
whom two are in India, one in China, two in Spain, one in Rio Janeiro,
one in St. Helena, one in Turk’s Island, one in South Africa, six in
Australia, twenty-three in the United States, and ten in the Canadian
Dominion. We are daily expecting more missionaries to be raised up
among us; one brother is studying with the Edinburgh Medical Mission,
and others who are still in the College have dedicated themselves to
Mission work.
Our statistics, jvhich are far from being complete, show that these
brethren baptised 20,676 persons in ten years (1865 —1874), that the
gross increase to their churches was 30,677, and the net increase 19,498.

One hundred and twenty pounds will be needed every week to carry

the Treasurer.


CHAPTER XIII.—THE STOCKWELL ORPHANAGE.
would never have occurred to us to commence an
Orphanage, but it was a part of the design of Pro-
vidence that such an institution should form part of
gl our programme, and, therefore, so it is.
pjfcgsltt) Iu the October number of the “ Sivord and Trowel ”
for 1866, there occurs the first allusion to an Orphan-
age — f ac t b e i n g that Mrs. Hillyard, a devoted
sister in the Lord, had put aside £20,000 for this purpose, and invited
us to take charge of it. This beloved friend was quite unknown to us
till we received a letter intimating her purpose. Our deacons at once
agreed to become our co-trustees, and we had a trust deed and scheme
prepared. In January, 1867, two-and-a-half acres of ground in Stock-
well, abutting upon the Clapham Road, were purchased, and we should
have proceeded to build, but a monetary panic occurred, and we were
unable to realize the securities which had been handed over to us,
which were mainly railway debentures. We could not even pay for
the ground without raising a loan on the securities, and this we felt
would be a very bad omen at the commencement of the undertaking.
The esteemed sister who had so freely given of her substance had
invested it very prudently, and it was impossible to foresee the peculiar
state of the money market which locked up all our funds ; but it was
wisely ordered, for the circumstance has been fraught with great
results to the Orphanage, since it has compelled us to retain a larger
endowment fund than we might otherwise have possessed, if, indeed,
we had thought of having any at all.
The scheme of the Orphanage proposed to do away with all voting
and canvassing, with the wasteful expenditure necessitated thereby, and
also to form the orphans into large families instead of massing them
together upon the workhouse system. This last idea was convenient
for the raising of money, for it enabled us to propose that individual
donors should each give the amount to build a house, and at the same
time we appealed to the Christian public for the means to pay for the
land, and the buildings which would be needed for the common use of
all the orphans, such as dining hall, schoolrooms, &c. We carried this
matter before God in prayer and looked up, and we beg the reader to
follow the entries in the “ Sword and Trowel ,” and mark the goodness
of God.
June, 1867. —The Lord is beginning to appear for us in the matter of the
Orphanage; but, as yet, he has not opened the windows of heaven as we desire


and expect. We wait in prayer and faith. We need no less than £lO,OOO to
erect the buildings, and it trill come; for the Lord will answer the prayer of
faith. One esteemed friend, Mr. George Moore, of Bow Churchyard, has, with
TESTIMONIAL HOUSES.
spontaneous generosity, sent £250. Three friends have offered £5O each, in
the hope that seventeen others will give the same.
8


July, 1867. —We have been waiting upon the Lord in faith and prayer con-
cerning our Orphanage ; but he is pleased at present to try us. As we have no
objectln view but the glory of God, by the instruction of fatherless boys in the
ways of the Lord, having a special view to their souls’ salvation, we had hoped
that many of the Lord’s people would at once have seen the usefulness and
practical character of the enterprise, and have sent us substantial aid immedi-
ately. The Lord’s way, however, is the best, and we rejoice in it, let it be what
it may : if the work is to be one of _time and long effort, so let it be, if theieby
God’s name is magnified. .
We have engaged a sister to receive the first four orphans into her own hired
house until the Orphanages are ready. One beloved friend, the original donor,
has given her plate to be sold for this object, and in so doing has set an example
to all believers who have surplus silver, which ought to be put to better use
than by lying wrapped up in a box.
August, 1867.—Let the facts, which with deep gratitude we record this
month, strengthen the faith of believers. In answer to many fervent prayers,
the Lord has moved his people to send in during the last month, in different
amounts, towards the general funds of the Orphanage, the sum of £1,075, for
which we give thanks unto the name of the Lord. More especially do we see
the gracious hand of God in the following incidents. A lady who has often
aided us in the work of the College, having been spared to see the twenty-fifth
anniversary of her marriage-day, her beloved husband presented her with £SOO
as a token of his ever-growing love to her. Our sister has called upon us, and
dedicated the £SOO to the building of one of the houses, to be called The Silver
Wedding House. The Lord bad, however, another substantial gift in store, to
encourage us in our work ; for a day or two ago a brother beloved in the Lord
called upon us on certain business, and when he had retired, he left in a sealed
envelope, the sum of £6OO, which is to be expended in erecting another house.
This donation was as little expected as the first, except that our faith expects
that all our needs will be supplied in the Lord’s own way. lhe next day, when
preaching in the open air, an unknown sister put an envelope into my hand,
enclosing £2O for the College, and another £2O for the Orphanage. “What
hath God wrought!”
Later on, Mr. William Higgs, of the Crown Works, South Lambeth,
and his workmen, promised to build a house, and Mr. Thomas Olney
and sons also agreed to erect another in memory of Mrs. Unity Olney,
deceased. So things moved on as the Lord would have them do.
The magazine for September, 1867, records the great doings at the
laying of the first stones of four houses: the Silver-wedding House , by
C. H. S.; the Merchant's House, by Mrs. Hillyard; Workman's House,
by Mr. William Higgs; and Unitij House, by Mr. Thomas Olney,
senior. At the close of the day £2,200 had been brought in: so that
the land had been purchased and four houses were provided for with-
out touching Mrs. Hillyard s gift. Thus far was the faithfulness ot
God in answering prayer tried and proved. After the meeting a storm
came on and carried away the wooden hall in which the meeting had
been held, but the mercy was that this had not happened when we
were all assembled in it. The damage w r as done when no one was
injured, and, through the sympathy which it evoked, it was a gain to
the funds.
Jan. 1868.—About three weeks ago, the noble sum of £I,OOO was brought
us by an unknown gentleman, towards the erection of two other houses.
March, 1868.—Just at the last moment, as we were going to press, we
received £2,000 from A. If., an unknown friend. We call upon all our friends


to magnify the Lord for this amazing instance of his care. How base a thing
is unbelief, and how largely does the Lord honour his servants’ failh! The
note which attended this munificent gift, proves it to be from the same donor
who gave £I,OOO a few weeks ago. We have feared that the Orphanage might
impoverish the College ; see, dear readers, how graciously the Lord rebukes
this unbelieving fear!
“ My dear Sir, —You will remember my intention to send a donation to your
College, I have this day dropped into your letter-box an envelope containing
two bank notes (£2,000), one of which is for the College and the remaining £I,OOO
to help complete the Orphanage. The latter led me to contribute to the former.
lam a stranger to you but not to your sermons (printed). May the Lord give
you health and strength many years to preach his word, and carry on his
work. A. B.”
April, 1868.—We are proceeding at the Stock well Orphanage with the
school-room, dining-hall, master’s house, four dwelling Houses, and the shell of
three other houses, which for the present will be used as a hall, in lieu of the
erection which was blown down. For all this we look up for means, and means

June Ist, 1868. —This day the Baptist churches presented £1,200
as a testimonial to C. H. Spurgeon.
To Messrs. Wigner & Goodall we cannot fully express our sense of
obligation, as secretary and treasurer of this fund, which enabled us
to build the two houses shown in the engraving, neither can we tell
forth the joy which the brotherly love of the churches created in our
heart. The amount was afterward made up to £1,765. Upon the
splendidly illuminated memorial presented to us were the following
kind sentences :
“ To the I!ev. C. 11. Spurgeon.
“ Dear Friend and Brother,
“We have much pleasure in presenting to you herewith a purse contain-
ing £1,200, the free-will offerings of a considerable number of individuals and
churches of our denomination in the United Kingdom.
“We have a two-fold object in this presentation. First, as a small token of
the high esteem in which we hold you ; secondly, to aid you in your noble effort
to find a home for orphan boys. We have watched your past career with praise
and prayer; praise to our covenant-keeping God who has so richly endowed
you with gifts for his service, inspired you with zeal in his cause, and blest you
with Pentecostal success; prayer, that he would keep you blameless to the end,
give you increasing love to and ever-growing success in his kingdom, and, finally,
the crown of eternal life. We honour you for your work’s sake, nor less for
your generous love to all your brethren in the ministry, and to the churches over
which they preside. To the blessed God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be all
the glory.
“We feel a deep interest in the Orphanage scheme which you have been
privileged to commence, and pray that you may have all needful grace to carry
it on. We desire that the two houses to be built with the money now cheer-
fully given, may prove an abundant blessing to many sons cf good and devoted
ministers of Jesus gone to their rest; in them may their children find a precious
home, be trained, blest, sanctified, and made blessings—a joy to you and an
honour to our Lord.
“ We rejoice to be able to say that all the responses to our circular have been
most affectionate and hearty, proving the deep interest which the churches feel
to the object, how you live in their hearts and are remembered in their prayers.
“Accept, then, dear brother, this testimonial on behalf of all the subscribers,
with the assurance of our high esteem, our fervent love, our earnest prayers.


“Grace, mercy and peace be multiplied unto you, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.
“ We are, dear brother, affectionately yours in Jesus,
“Alex. B. Goodall, Treasurer.
“Ist June, 1868. “John Thomas Wigner, Hon. Sec."
On the 19th of June, 1868, on our birthday, we received the
tenderest tokens of the love of our dear flock. Mr. Thomas Olnev,
junior, and our huge Sabbath-school, gathered around the first stone
of the house which they are to build, and the songs and shouts made
us all cheerfully remember our youth. It is no small thing for our
esteemed superintendent to undertake to supply a house, but with a
little help it will be done. As a token of love from past and present
students, they had also resolved to build a house. The Lord bless
them for it. Our beloved wife, so long an invalid, and even then
far from well, was most lovingly requested by the ministers and
students of the College to lay the first stone of the College House.
She was graciously upheld, although the surpassing kindness displayed
was enough to overcome a far stronger frame. After the stone-laying
was over, twenty-six sweet little girls in white advanced, one by one,
and presented Mrs. Spurgeon with purses, which their parents had
subscribed as a token of their affectionate rejoicing at her restoration
to our midst. It was a most beautiful and unexpected spectacle one
which none will ever forget.
By the end of 1869 all the buildings were finished, at a cost of
£10,200, and were enlirely free of debt. Since then an Infirmary,
Bath, and Laundry have been added, and two of the houses have been
elevated another story, and the money has been found for all, by
the gracious hand of the Lord.
With 240 children we now need £5,000 per annum ; we have
constantly received it, and we always shall. The endowments of the insti-
tution are now valued at £30,000, and will, we hope, increase till all the
expenses will be supplied, and we shall be free to go on to a Girls’
Orphanage which we have long contemplated. This story flows on
swimmingly, but there have been many trials of faith in the matter,
and these continue, so far as the daily expenditure is concerned. A few
of our memoranda will show how the Lord delivered us.
Dec., 1869—As our friends are aware, we have been suddenly laid aside by
an attack of small-pox. When we thus found ourselves put out of the way just
when we were wanted in a thousand places, we cried to the Lord to let none of
our work suffer, and especially we begged him to care for the Orphanage and
College. Within a few hours a beloved friend, knowing nothing of our afflic-
tion, called and left £5OO for the Orphanage, flow condescendingly did the
Lord thus ease his poor servant’s mind ! We felt a sweet peace and holy j y
in leaving all the rest of our work in the same hands. A day or two after,
Wednesday, November 17, a letter was received, enclosing £l,OOO. Hire again
we bless the name of the Lord, and set to our seal that God is true.
Oct. 1870.—Our best thanks are due to Mr. Hugh Stowell Brown, and his
friends, for a second time inviting us to Liverpool and giving such noble help
to the Orphanage. This makes £450 raised for the Orphans in Myrtle Street.
Feb. 1871.—Some little time ago, our friend, Mr. Bath, who often aids the
Orphanage,gave us six dozen bunches of turnips,and merrily added, ‘I hope


someone will send you llie mutton.’ About an hour after, a farmer sent a whole
sheep; so the mutton and turnips were both on the spot.
One esteemed lady friend, and the ladies of her school, have now made us,
we think in all, 700 shirts for the boys. May their labour of love be richly
rewarded. (Since then they have sent us in all 2,590 shirts.)
duly, 1872.—We have again to sing of mercy. No sooner was the empty
state of our Orphanage exchequer made known to our faithful friends, than the
Lord inclined their hearts to send the necessary aid. This is a distinct answer
to prayer, for other charities have been in the same condition and have made
many urgent appeals without evoking the reply which they desired. So prompt
and generous have been the responses of our loving helpers, that, after paying
£3OO for the demands of the month, we have still £1,200 in hand—a marvellous
change, indeed, from an actual deficit of £9O, and all within a few days.
Dec. 1873.—We were not well enough "to be at the meeting of Trustees, but
quite able to understand the report of the monthly settlement. During the
week, a friend gave us £5O. Mr. Chown, of Bradford, kindly sent £125, the
result of a collection, and, with other sums, we had more than £7OO in hand. The
time had, however, come for new suits for the orphans and certain expenses
incident to the season, and to our surprise the report of the secretary was “ all
bills paid , but only £3 left." Prayer went to work at once, and results followed.
Will the reader, however, picture himself with more than 220 boys to feed and
£3 in hand ! He may say, ‘The Lord will provide,’ but would he feel the force
of this truth if he were in our straits ? From the date above mentioned, we have
lived on, but it has been very much from hand to mouth, —and it is very sweet
to see how the Lord provides. A friend in Sweden sent us help, and another
from Belgium. A young man sends 6s. 6d., being threepence per week of his
first wages, adding, ‘ May it please the Lord to put it into the hearts of many
to support you in your great undertaking.’ A brother, with a large family, offers
some potatoes and turnips, and remarks that since he has given to the
Orphanage, he has been much the gainer by improved crops. A donor, who
is accustomed to store weekly for the Lord, speaks of the plan as greatly bene-
ficial. One who sends a considerable donation, says, “ I never write a cheque
for you without feeling very sorry that I cannot make it ten times as much.”
Our expenses, exclusive of our income from property, amount to £lO a day,
and two or three gentlemen have each sent us a day’s supply; and while the
ink is yet in our pen, we are pleasantly interrupted by the postman with two
cheques of £lO each from Cardiff. Having soon to start for the south of
France, we should be grateful to our heavenly Father if he would enable us to
go away with some little store left on hand for the trustees to pay their way
with in our absence.
June, 1874.—The funds of the Orphanage ran completely dry on May Bth,
and drove us to plead with God for replenishment. The answer was imme-
diate and sufficient. On the very day in which supplication was made nearly
£4OO was sent into the treasury, and our heart was gladdened.
March, 1875. —The funds of the Orphanage are very low. When the tide
has quite ebbed out the flood will return. Our 230 boys persist in eating, and
wearing out their clothes, or we would not even mention the matter of failing
funds, but appetites are stubborn things, and our boys have double-barrelled
ones.
Sept. 1875.—We have this month received the largest amount, save one,
ever entrusted to us at one time, namely £10,000; half of it is for the
Orphanage, and will be invested according to our general rule with legacies,
unless our daily needs should compel us to draw upon it.
Nov. 1875.—This month we have had many generous helps, but one of them
lias charmed us beyond measure. The good friends at Reading have held a
bazaar for our Orphanage, and the net result is £1,158 !! We never dreamed
of such a thing, and can hardly realise it now. 'This is royal munificence, sur-
passing anything done fur ua by any town in England. We bless the name of


the Lord, and take courage. We can now go away to our short rest without
the slightest anxiety on the score of the orphans.
After this manner onr experience varies, but never ceases to bear
testimony to a faithful God and the power of believing prayer.
The Orphanage is approached from the Clapham Road by a broad
avenue. Our woodcut was taken some time ago, and since it was
executed, plane trees have been planted on either side, and have attained
a good growth, very greatly adding to the beauty of the entrance.
Before you is the entrance arch, to the right is the master’s house,
and to left are the dining hall and kitchen. Observe on the pillar on
the right the S'word and the Trowel, the pastor’s motto, and on the
left the testimony to the great truth that faith will be honoured and
“ The Lord will provide On the inner sides of the two first piers are
the text “ My God shall supply all your need according to his riches
in gloi'y by Christ Jesus.” When standing under the noble archway
note again the text which strengthens our hearts in Orphanage work,


STOCKWELL ORPHANAGE.


“ A Father of the fatherless, and a judge of the ividow is God in Jus holy
habitation ' On the piers fronting the Orphanage grounds are the two
following inscriptions, " Solomon in all his glory teas not arrayed like one
of these," and “ Your heavenly Father feedeth them," which again pro-
claim our hope and the ground of our confidence.
On looking from under the arch the
visitor is struck with the size and beauty
of the buildings, and the delightfully airy
and open character of the whole institu-
tion. It is a place of sweetness and light,
where merry voices ring out and happy
children play. The stranger will be
pleased with the dining hall , hung round
with engravings given by Mr. Graves, of
Pall Mall; he will be shown into the hoard
room where the trustees transact the bus-
iness: and he will be specially pleased
with the great play hall in which our
public meetings are held and the boys’
sports are carried on. There is the
swimming bath, which enables us to say
that nearly every boy can swim. Up
at the very top of the buildings, after
ascending two flights of stairs, the visitor
will find the school-rooms, which from
their very position are airy and whole-
some. The floors, scrubbed by the boys
themselves, the beds made, and the do-
mestic arrangements all kept in order by their own labour are usually
spoken of with approbation. The matrons are glad to show fi lends
over their houses; Mr. Charlesworth, the excellent master, is always
pleased to arrange for friends to look over the schools and the build-
ings and when there is no contagious disease abroad, he will conduct
them to the infirmary, where the best of nurses will be glad to show
them their domains. , „ ~ ,
The Infirmary itself stands at the further end of the Orphanage
grounds, and is spacious enough to accommodate a, large number or
children should an epidemic break out in the institution. It was built
after the other portions had been finished, and has pioyed a great
blessing, for ever since its erection the speedy isolation of ailing bojs
has checked the spread of contagious disease, and by God s blessing h«s
preserved our average of health at a very high point indeed. VV e give
a view of it upon the opposite page. .
Our esteemed friend, Mr. Charlesworth, formerly assistant minister
at Surrey Chapel, enters most heartily into his work, and as head mas-
ter saves us a world of anxiety. Me are also singularly happy m all
the helpers. Long may they be spared to us. M e are under deep
obligations to Messrs. Bartlett, Daniel, Evans, Macgregor, Andrew
Dunn, and others, who labour for the spiritual good of the boys on the
Sabbath, and to voluntary teachers who kindly take such branches of
education as French, Music, &c., and give us their services without fee


or reward. Inasmuch as these, and our donors, and various helpers
have done it unto these little ones, they have done it unto their Lord
himself, and they shall not lack their reward.
We have already seen many children converted, and these are formed
into a Christian band. Several of the lads who have left have subscribed
handsomely to the funds ; almost without exception all the boys in
situations are doing well, and one is in the College, giving every token
of becoming a good minister of Jesus Christ.
THE INFIRMARY.
The whole work is carried on in dependence upon God, and his
blessin" is manifestly resting upon it. Having no list of subscribers,
no payments for votes, and a continual need for nearly £4,000 above
the income from property, we are, nevertheless, well supplied. At the
same time, as the Lord works by means, the reader will, we trust, con-
sider how much of the needed provision he is himself bound to send
in About £BO a week is needed. Gifts of food, clothing, firing, &c.,
will be acceptable. Direct cash to C. H. Spurgeon, Nightingale Lane,
Clapham, Surrey, and parcels to Mr. Charlesworth, the Orphanage,
Stockwell. The Orphanage is for destitute fatherless boys. Applicants
must be between the ages of six and ten.


CHAPTER XIV.—THE COLPORTAGE ASSOCIATION.
in order of time the Colportage was our
third work, we are very far from considering it to be
of third-rate importance ; on the contrary, we believe
it to be one of the most efficient and economical
agencies in existence, and, as education increases, it
will be more and more so. The sale of vicious
literature can only be met by the distribution of good
books: these can only be scattered in rural districts by carrying the
books to the doors, and even in towns the book-hawkers work
greatly stimulates their sale. Scotland has long had a grand stafil of
colporteurs, it was time to make a beginning for England.
The work was forced upon us by the of a generous friend
at the Tabernacle to whom we are under great obligations. Ihe com-
mittee was formed in September, 1866 : certain earnest young brethren
undertaking the management of the enterprise. During the next two
years six men were employed, and it was not easy to find the means for
their support; this enterprise seemed to be one plant too many in our
garden, and had it not been for the persevering entreaties of the
principal promoter of this work, we should have allowed it to die out.
In 1872 the work began to grow, and God’s good hand was with it, so
that thirteen men were in the field. This growth rendered it needful to
supplement the energetic labours of the honorary staff, to whom gieat
honour is due, by appointing a paid secretary, Mr. W. Corden Jones,
who has proved to be well adapted to his place. In 1874 the sales had
nearly reached £3,000, with thirty-five men at work, and at this
moment (1876) forty-five men are employed. The Society now
possesses a trade stock of £BOO, and is in need of an annual income
of £2,500. These dimensions are respectable, but to meet the
demands of England they ought to be multiplied by ten.
The depot of this society is in the College buildings. The
society is unsectarian in principle, after the same manner as the
London City Mission; although most of its colporteurs are Baptists at
present, this arises from the fact that they have been applied for by
Baptists and supported by them. Each man costs about £BO per
annum, but on the receipt of £4O a-year from any lovers of a full and
free salvation, a colporteur will be appointed to the district which the
donors may select, and the colporteur will work in connection with those
who provide this measure of support. Many churches find such a man
to be the best and cheapest worker imaginable.


The colporteur not only endeavours to sell books, but he visits from
door to door, and in so doing converses with the people about their
souls prays with the sick, and leaves a tract at each cottage. He is
frequently able to hold prayer meetings, open air services, and Bible-
readings. He gets a room, if possible, and preaches, founds Bands ot
Hope, and makes himself generally useful in the cause ot religion and
THE COLPORTEUR.
temperance. He is in fact at first a missionary, then a preacher, and by-
and-by in the truest sense a pastor. We have some noble men in this
work. All are not equally good, some have even proved slothful; but
the system is one which soon discovers a man’s negligence, since his
sales fall off, and the monthly report tells the tale.
The book-hawker stands upon a vantage ground as a house to house


missionary. His pack is a passport to every door, the attempt to sell is
an opportunity for declaring the Gospel, and the book iiself is a ready text.
When we think of 300,000 visits paid in one year among a priest-ridden
peasantry, we are encouraged, and give God the glory. But we cannot
restrain the sigh “ O that some rich stewards of the Lord would look
on this work and help us to increase it.” London has only one of
our colporteurs and yet needs them badly ; how is this ? Will no one
employ a man ? No money can be more wisely expended, nor used more
directly for the benefit of those who most require it. Send on your cheques
to C. H. Spurgeon, Nightingale Lane, Clapham, Surrey. Reports and
every information will be cheerfully sent on application to the Secretary
of the Colportage Society, Pastors’ College, Temple Street, Southwark.
BIBLE CARRIAGE.
Mr. Charlesworth’s two Bible-classes have generously agreed to
support a brother with a Bible carriage in the streets of London.
Would not some other communities of young people do well to have
their own man at work in the regions where they dwell ? Think of it.


CHAPTER XV.-OTHER INSTITUTIONS CONNECTED
WITH THE TABERNACLE.
Tabernacle Building Fund. —Up to Jan. 1876, this fund stood at £4.>00,
but by the generous offer of an anonymous donor it has just now been
raised to £SOOO. The capital is lent out without interest to chapels
in debt, to encourage them to clear themselves of their liabilities, thus
this capital remains and continues to benefit one church after another.
The fund was originally raised in order that the Pastor might feel that
in case of his death there would be money available to pay for the com-
pletion of the studies of the men in College : to do this, however,
would now require a large amount.
Mrs. Spurgeon's Book Fund— The Pastor’s beloved wife, touched
with the poverty of many ministers, commenced this fund to supply the
most needy with books. She makes this the pleasant business of her
life, when she has respite from pain, and sufficient strength. Already
(March, 1876) she has received and expended £3OO, having by prudent
purchasing been able to give at least £SOO worth of books to brethren
whose libraries are scantily furnished.
Mr. Chicken's German Mission.— The church supports two missionaries
in (xermany—at Templin and Hamburg. .
Mission to the Jews.— There is a small auxiliary to this mission, of
which Miss Higgs is the secretary.
Mr. Orsman's Mission in Golden Lane, City, one of the most useful
in all London, is an entirely independent enterprise, but Mr. Orsman, as
still a member at the Tabernacle, would be unhappy if we did not
mention him. All the arrangements of an active church, and all the
necessary adjuncts of a vigorous mission, are to be found under the
supervision of this honoured brother, who deserves all the encouiagement
and assistance that can be rendered him.
Richmond Street Mission and Schools, Walworth. President J. I.
Dunn. —i n 1875 new premises were erected for this mission at a cost
of over £9OO which is all paid. Sunday and Ragged Schools, and adult
classes. Children in schools 650. Preaching, tract distribution, Band
of Hope, Evangelistic work, &c., —all in active operation.
Green Walk Mission, Bermondsey . —President, W. Olney, Junr. A
mighty warfare against sin has been carried on here, and very many
brought to Jesus and added to the Tabernacle church. Hall thronged
to hear the gospel. About 350 children in the schools. Mothers meet-
ings, Band of Hope, Tract Society, Open air mission, Bible and singing
classes, and Children’s special service. All at work and all alive, neie


a good hall must be built. If some generous friend would build a place
for this mission, the money would be well laid out.
James Grove, Peckham. —Here a chapel has been built and a congre-
gation gathered, with schools. Our Elder, John Field, has just left it for
a pastorate, and matters are in a transition state. It is a fine property,
and much good has been done in it. Many members have been added
to the Tabernacle church, and we hope ere long to form them into a
separate community, and let them run alone.
Mr. Hampton's Blind Mission. —Established four years, for the evan-
gelization of the poor blind. For this ive need a hall, for at present we
are cramped for numbers, and the overcrowding of very poor people is
most unhealthy, and indeed unbearable. There is a Sunday-school for
blind children. Tea is given on Sunday afternoon to the blind and
their guides, and then service is held, two hundred blind and guides
attend. £l4B expended in 1875, and much more is needed : but a
hall near the Tabernacle is our greatest necessity. Remittances can be sent
to C. H. Spurgeon, president. Mr. Hampton, a working painter, is the
right worthy conductor of this work of mercy.
Mrs. Thomas's Mothers' Mission.— Our afflicted friend carries on this
work with the help of some of our members, and it is a great success.
Seventy women are on the books. £7O expended per annum. Clothes,
loan-boxes, &c., provided for poor women.
Other mothers’ meetings are held by various ladies of the church.
Tabernacle Sunday School. —Superintendent, Mr. Davis. Held in
the Tabernacle school-room and in the College. Children, 1,000 in
regular attendance ; 150 in senior classes, which each one deserve
separate mention if we had space; 37 joined the church in 1875.
Young Christians’ Association, 216 members. Children’s and teachers’
Library. The school raises from £SO to £6O per annum for the Baptist
Missionary Society. There is a Band of Hope, and a working class.
Almshouses. —The day schools are as full as they can hold, and under
Mr. Johnson’s care provide a superior education. llere there are Sunday-
schools, and an adult class of 120 members under Mr. Daniel. Mr.
Bartlett’s children’s service is held in the evening, and he also con-
ducts a young Christians’ meeting.
Orphanage: here, too, Sunday-school work goes on vigorously.
Several schools in our neighbourhood are wholly conducted and many
more very nearly so by our members, but as they nominally belong
to other churches, or are quite independent, we do not mention them here,
though we furnish teachers for schools all around us.
Mrs. Bartlett's Class.— This famous class, since the decease of its
invaluable leader, is now presided over by her son Edward, who is an
indefatigable labourer in many ways. The class is well attended,
numbering from 500 to 700 ; it carries on many meetings and works of
usefulness, and manifests a right royal liberality to the College, lor
which it raises a large amount annually. Very many have come into
the church from this class.
Mr. Perkins' Bible Class. —An earnest, united band of young men,
who meet on Sabbath afternoons in the Vestry of the Tabernacle.
They carry on different works of usefulness and aid the College.
Mr. Bowker's Bible Class is of the same character, and meets in the


Octagonal Room of the College. It is an earnest class, helps its own
poor, works for Jesus, and aids in supporting the College.
Mr. Charlesivorth has a Ladies' Bible Class, on Thursdays before the
service, and a Young Men's Bible Class on Sabbath afternoons —both
prospering. The two classes support a Bible-carriage.
Baptist Country Mission. —President, Mr. Bowker. A small society,
but full of life. It seeks to evangelize the villages by open air
preaching and opening rooms for services. With small funds, it has
during the lust year carried on three promising interests—in Putney,
Walthamstow, and Carshalton. Others in past years have become self-
supporting churches, and so will these. It is making attempts in
villages further afield, and Christ is preached faithfully. It is an
evangelistic elfort for the suburbs and country. Its expenditure was
only £6O last year. It could economically use ten times as much.
Evangelists' Association. —Secretary, Elder Elvin. Is fully at work
in halls, lodging-houses, street corners, the Tabernacle steps, &c.
Services have been successfully carried on at Dunn’s Institute, and
Tabernacle Almshouses, and in various chapels where the ministers
have allowed evangelistic meetings to be held. This society sends
brethren to any church needing such assistance. Expenses in 1875,
£4O.
Loan Tract Society for Tabernacle District. —Secretary, Mr. Wood.
Tracts and the pastor’s sermons are lent out and 2,000 families visited
every week. Several conversions have resulted.
General Loan Tract Society. —Secretary, Mr. Cornell. Supplies the
pastor's sermons in free grants to poor districts, where friends arrange
for their loan. With the very best results this work has been carried
on in seventeen counties of England, and had we more money and
more applicants this agency would become a great power. Income £45.
Another society, called The Rock Loan Tract Society, lends sermons
chiefly in country villages. Secretary, Mr. Hawkins.
The Ordinance Poor Fund distributes among the poor members of the
church about £BOO annually.
Ladies’ Benevolent Society. —Secretary, Mrs. Potier. For making cloth-
ing, and relieving the poor. A very useful society. Income £lO5.
Ladies' Maternal Society. —Secretary, Mrs. Jenkins. For the aid of
poor women in their confinements. 162 boxes of linen lent during the
year. Income £56. A society which ought to be seven times as large.
Mrs. Evans' Home and Foreign Missionary Working Society makes up
boxes of garments for missionaries, and also for poor ministers and their
families at home. This is a blessed work, and has made glad many a
poor servant of Jesus. Friends who wish to aid poor Baptist ministers
cannot do better than give their money to this society, which, by the
willing work of its young members, turns the money into useful articles.
Two Benefit Societies hold their meetings in the rooms of the Taber-
nacle—“ The United Christian Brothers,” and “The United Christian
Sisters.” For the payment of 6d. per w r eek, 10s. a-week is provided
in sickness, and £lO at death of member or member’s wfife. These
societies are not a part of the church work, but we believe that they do
much good.

NEW WORK BY C. H. SPUFIGEON.
PRICE 2s. 6d.
COMMENTING AND COMMENTARIES:
Two Lectures addressed to the Students of the Pastors’
College, Metropolitan Tabernacle, •
TOGETHER WITH A
Catalogue of biblical Commentaries^ a«tr expositions.
The success of Mr. Spurgeon’s first series of Lectures to his Students has fully answered the
sanguine expectations which we ventured to express on the first appearance of that most enter-
taining and instructive work. * * * The second volume has for its subject “Commenting and
Commentaries,’’ and consists of two lectures, to which is appended a Catalogue of Biblical Com-
mentaries and Expositions, which is intended to guide smdents as to the works which they ought to
purchase. * * * * In the opening lecture we find much good matter, of a suggestive and racy
sort. * * * * The Catalogue of Commentaries fills nearly 170 pages, and represents an enormous
amount of labour. Its compiler has passed under review some three or four thousand volumes, and
to each that he has included in his list he appends a brief review, often lighted up with pleasant
gleams of mirth. * * * It will be a new thing to many to have Mr. Spurgeon introduced to their
notice as a bookworm; but his intimate friends have long known that he is full of quaint out-of-the-
way literary knowledge, and that in certain directions he has a matchless acquaintance with books.
We are surprised at the general soundness of his conclusions, where he ventures an opinion, and
we hope that the volume will find its way into every minister’s library.— Christian World.
Taken as a whole, the Catalogue is a marvel of research and impartiality. We ought to add its
cheapness is not less remarkable. It ought to be prized by all preachers, and to have a large
circulation.— English Independent.
Every candid reader will admit that, in impartiality, in terse and telling brevity, in wisdom
sharpened into wit, in unaffected zeal for Christ's cause, and, above all, in robust common sense,
this volume has few equals, if any.— Literary World.
In his own racy fashion, Mr. Spurgeon here furnishes a large amount of information on com-
mentaries in general, thejsubject having been taken up and dealt with by him in two lectures
delivered to the students of his Pastors’ College. These lectures abound in good advice forcibly
set forth, and embody the results of much observation and study. Appended to them is a long
list of the principal works on the whole or portions of the Scriptures, with sundry fitting remarks
respecting each as to its general excellence, and its value to a student and possible preacher. This
little volume is issued at a low price, and should command a large circulation on account of its
practical value.— The Rock.
Besides a couple of prefaces we have two lectures, one on “ Commenting,” the other “ A Chat about
Commentaries’’; while the main body of the book is occupied with “A Catalogue of Biblical Com-
mentaries and Expositions.’’ This part of our author’s task has entailed enormous toil, and no
inconsiderable outlay of cash; and the book is withal so cheap that he does not expect to receive,
either now or hereqfter, any pecuniary consideration. * * * * In the article “A Chat about
Commentaries,” w» encounter an abundance of those piquant passages for which the author is
famous. * * * * * Such a catalogue, coming from such a source, will doubtless be hailed as a
welcome reference-book by th ousands of hard-working men, and will for many years to come prove
correspondingly useful. — The Baptist.
This volume extends to 200 pp., neatly bound and well printed. * » • * Some book makers
could not have produced such a book under half-a-sovereign. Considering that Mr. Spurgeon
enumerates 1,435 authors of commentaries, and kindly appends his own trustworthy comments upon
them as to their service for Bible Students, they cannot but see their indebtedness to him for placing
his integrity, judgment, and zeal at their service for thirty pence.— Christian Aye.
Under the title of “ Commenting and Commentaries,” Mr. Spurgeon has published a small volume,
which will be found most useful to all clergymen, dissenting ministers, and in fact all students of
the Bible. * * * * Booksellers will do well to bring it before the notice of their customers.—
The Bookseller.
