Compiler's Note
THE second edition of this little catalogue, revised and corrected up to the termination
of the first complete year of the War, contains nearly three times the number of
stamps included in the edition published in March, 19x5.
The catalogue shows that 361 stamps issued during the past twelve months owe
their origin to the War of Wars. These may be classified as follows :
These, with their formidable array of minor varieties, already present a wide
field of interest for the collector; some of the occupation stamps commenced their
career as rarities, and have realised high prices in the chief stamp markets of the
world, but the great majority of the stamps in this list are still easily accessible.
The information embodied in the catalogue is as full as it has been possible to
give it in concise form. We have endeavoured to give in addition to the general and
philatelic description, and actual illustrations of the stamps, the date of issue and
where of significance, the quantities printed. The dates are not necessarily more
than approximate, and we shall be glad to hear from collectors who are in a position
to correct or amplify the particulars given. The quantities given in some instances
in the earlier edition have been deleted where the later information has shewn them
to be inaccurate or doubtful.
The chief contractions used in the catalogue are " Perf." = perforated ; "Wmk."
= watermark, watermarked.
The ruled columns provided should prove of convenience to the collector for
noting the stamps as acquired, or for recording the prices quoted for the stamps on
the market. The compiler, not being a stamp dealer, has not inserted any prices,
but would refer his readers to the regular stamp dealers for quotations on such stamps
as they can supply from this list.
New editions of the list will be published at intervals as occasion requires.
News of additions or corrections will be welcomed by the compiler, Mr. Fred. J.
Melville, 14 Sudbourne Road, Brixton, S.W. (Telephone Brixton 2022).
