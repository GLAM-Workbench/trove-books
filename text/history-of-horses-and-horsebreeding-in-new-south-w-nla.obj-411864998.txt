NEW SOUTH WALES,
Paper read by Mr., now Sir JOHN LACKEY, before the Agricultural
Society of New South Wales, August, 1873, Sir HERCULES
ROBINSON, President, in the chair.




HORSES AND HORSE-BREEDING.
The following is the full paper “On the best mode of encourag-
ing the most valuable breed of horses most useful in the colony
and for export,” read by Mr. Lackey, M.L.A., at the monthly
meeting of the Agricultural Society, held on Wednesday after-
noon, Sir Hercules Robinson in the chair.
It having been decided by the Agricultural Society of New
South Wales that the time had arrived when it should make
some serious attempt to gather agricultural experience of the
colony, with a view to the gratuitous dissemination of it amongst
those who are in possession of the land, and the Society havi.ig
done me the honor to ask me to read the first paper on “ the best
mode of encouraging the more valuable breed of horses most use-
ful in the colony and for export,” I have undertaken that duty
in the hope that the opinions and experience that I put forward
may be the means of eliciting discussion and criticism, which
shall have the effect of drawing the attention of those interested
in the breeding of horses to a practical consideration of the sub-
ject, and which, I trust, will lead to more care and attention in
the breeding and rearing of the classes of horses which shall be
found most suitable for the general requirements of the colony,
for export, and at the same time most profitable for the breeder.
I shall' commence with the thoroughbred or blood horse,
regarding him, as 1 do, as being capable of use in almost any capa-
city, as far as his actual strength will go, and if due care were
regarded in breeding, he might be produced suitable to every
description of work short of heavy draught, and even for ordinary
draught I venture to state that a dash of blood would be found
to dive more activity and endurance.
The breeding of blood horses in New South Wales has already
been so great a success that 1 feel it scarcely necessary to dwell
on this subject at any great length ; but I must express a regret
that the breeding of blood horses has been so regarded as to pro-
duce them fit for racing purposes only—the style of modern
racing being only for pace both in England and the colonies, the
short race being most favoured, has had the effect of diverting
the attention of breeders from the large, well-developed, and mus-
cular class of horse which used to be regarded so highly as a welter
horse or weight carrier. In fact we have had one class of breeders
producing race-horses in which they have been eminently successful,


as our victories over the other colonies will testify, not excepting our
neighbors of Victoria, who have so largely, and with very com-
mendable spirit, imported to their colony from England a great
number of the most expensive and fashionable stallions and mares.
And we have had another class of breeders producing heavy
draught horses which they have produced of a very useful and
valuable kind. But the roadster, the carriage horse, and the
cavalry horse have been entirely and sadly neglected. lam not
aware of any breeder who has devoted his attention exclusively
to the production of either of these useful descriptions of horses.
Let us hope, however, now that the requirements of the colony
have largely increased, the Indian market promises a large demand,
and the pastoral prospects of the colony are in'such a prosperous,
condition, that breeders will give their attention to the production
ot these useful and valuable animals. In this our Victorian
friends are far before us, and have succeeded in the production of
the roadster or hackney, the carriage horse and the hunter ; so
much indeed that the large amount which used to find their way
to the coffers of this colony for horses suitable to the Indian
market are now reaped by the Victorian breeder.
Whilst on the subject of blood horses I would take the oppor-
tunity of remarking that we have amongst the blood stock of the
colony stallions capable of producing almost any of the more
useful description of horses ; to do this, however, due and careful
regard must be had in the first place to the description of horse it
is desired to produce. And the first axiom laid down by the
authorities on the horse is that “like will produce like.” It
should be a careful consideration of the breeder that the qualities
of the sire and dam be so adjusted that any failing on the part of
either be compensated by a special quality on the part of the
other.
On a reflection of the number of first-class horses amongst our
racing studs at the present, as well as in times past, it is somewhat
remarkable that as compared with imported stallions, those of
colonial breed —though from the best ancestors —have been so un-
successful in the stock they have produced. I can call to mind
hardly one colonial bred stallion that has signalised himself as the
progenitor of a successful line of winners on the turf, until we
come to the name of thr renowned Sir Hercules, and his son
Yattendon. Let us hope that The Barb will be another exception.
When we consider the distinct mark left in each case by the im-
ported stallions, since the first days of breeding in the colony, we
fail to find any corresponding mark in the progeny of their best
sons. Camerton, Hector, Whisker, Skeleton, Gratis, Iros, Cap-a-
pie, Emigrant, St. John, New Warrior, with many others I now
cannot recollect, all distinguished themselves in the stud, and


stand out pre-eminently in the stock they produced, both as racers
and roadsters.
Old Oamerton was imported by Mr. Lethbridge about the year
1825. Got by Oamerton out of Waltouia, Oamerton served in the
colony many years, chiefly on the Hunter. His stock were no-
torious for their performances both on the turf and on the road.
His sire, Oamerton, was one of the horses who ran at Stockbridge,
the gamest race recorded in the annals of the English turf. Four
started—Oamerton, Shoestrings, Offa's Dyte, and another. Of
these, one broke down, a second went blind shortly after, the third
fell dead at the winning post, and the fourth newer started again.
Won by Oamerton.
Hector was imported in the early days of the colony ; his stock
greatly distinguished themselves on the colonial turf of his day,
and he produced a class of roadsters both remarkable for endu-
rance and hardihood.
Whisker was imported when a yearling by the late Mr. Henry
Bayley ; unfortunately this noble animal died very early in his
career, or he would doubtless have left his stamp indelibly on
Australian horses ; as the sire of the renowned horse Jorrocks,
however, he can never be forgotten, especially by those who re-
collect the many gallant struggles of this rare old animal over
Homebush, Maitland, Parramatta or Windsor.
Skeleton was imported about the year 1830, I believe by the
late Mr. Riley, of Raby, and was bred in Ireland by Mr. Kelly.
His performances were very good. He won on the Curragh of
Kildare live races out of six in the first year of his running. He
was bought at Tattersalls by Mr. Riley for £7OO, his previous
owner, Prince Esterhasy, having paid 2400 guineas for him to the
Marquis of Sligo. He served many years at Camden, and besides
having produced a large number of valuable horses as racers and
roadsters, was the sire of Messrs. Macarthur’s Alice Greg.
Besides these I may enumerate Tros, Gratis, Cap-a-pie, Emi-
grant, St. John, New Warrior, and others, all having specially
distinguished themselves in the stock they produced, but I fail to
find an equal amount of success attending the of their
best sons, these, too, having come from pure-bred and distinguished
mares, and having all the advantage which our climate is said to
possess for horse-breeding. I may instance one of our finest
colonial-bred horses, Sir Charles, by Gratis, from imported Lorina.
lam not aware of his having produced anything at all equal to
himself. Lottery, also a very fine horse, Whalebone by specula-
tion ; Cossack, the best horse of his day, Old Plover, Volunteer,
and, 1 am afraid, Tarragon, must be added to the list, though one
of the best performers on the colonial turf, as well as an almost
perfect horse to the eye. It must be very gratifying to Mr. H.


H. Kater that his foresight and enterprise many years ago have
been so successful. Mr. Kater was, perhaps, our largest importer,
having introduced into the colony, besides Cap-a-pie and Paraguay,
the sire and dam of Sir Hercules ; Tros, the sire of Cassandra,
and dam of Mr. E. H. Cox’s magnificent horse Yattendon ; Gig-
gler, the dam of Vanguard, Cantab, Smuggler, and some others.
Mr. Kater is now living near Sydney, having retired from his
country pursuits, and in a communication I had with him a short
time since, shows the lively interest he takes in the success of the
progeny of his early importations.
I shall now refer to the roadster or hackney, one of the most
useful of all our horses, and in a previous paragraph I have
alluded to the success achieved by the Victorians in the raising of
this description of horse; still by giving the care and attention
necessary I have no doubt that we shall be equally successful here.
The hackney or roadster may be produced from a well-selected
sire, of a light draught breed, and, as has been laid clown by a
well-known writer, with as much goodness and strength as possible
in a little space. Next to compactness, the inclination of the
shoulder will be regarded, as a stallion with upright shoulders never
got a capital hackney. From a horse with this failing nothing can
be got except it be a cart horse. He should be well up in the
wither, short in the back, well ribbed up round the barrel, and
short in the cannon and flat below the knee, with a sound set of
legs, free from splint, spavin or curb, and with a good set of feet.
If he have any of these defects, they may be hereditary, in
which case they are sure to crop out in the offspring. It is
necessary he should have a good rein, arched neck, and head well
put on, with a kind expression of the eye. He should bo active
also, lifting his legs well in his paces, with not too much knee
action. His tail should be well set on, as nothing gives a better
or gamer appearance to a horse than a tail well carried. A horse
of this description is capable, with suitable mares, of producing a
class of horse very suitable for general purposes and with sufficient
bone and substance to undergo a large amount of work—these
latter qualities being most essential to counteract the weediuess
which neglect in breeding has permitted so many of the colonial
horses to fall into. It is scarcely necessary for me to add that
the offspring is likely to be stronger and stouter from a vigorous
young horse than from one very old or which has been worn out
at work.
It has been frequently stated by breeders that it is more
difficult to select a good mare to breed from than a good horse,
because she possesses somewhat opposite qualities. To a horse as
above described might be put a half-bred or three quarters bred
mare, the younger the better, provided she bo fully matured. It


is a great mistake to imagine that a hard-worked, worn out old
mare, untit for work, will do for breeding. This is a great but
very popular error. The mare should be sound, young, and with
a good constitution ; she should be long and roomy, to give space
for the growth of the foetus, and with these should be compact-
ness of form and shortness of leg—as the whole of the colonial
horses have a tendency to grow to leg. Peculiarity of form and
constitution will also be inherited. This is a most important but
neglected consideration, for however desirable or even perfect may
have been the conformation of the sire, every good point may be
neutralised or lost by the defective form, or want of blood, of the
mare. It is necessary that the essential points should be good for
both parents, and that some minor detect in either should be met
and got rid of by excellence, in that particular point, ot the other.
The unskilful or careless breeder will often so badly pair the
animals that the good points of each will be in a manner lost, the
defects of both will be increased, and the produce will be far
inferior to both sire and dam. A well-known authority has written
that the roadster may, and should, like the hunter, possess
different degrees of blood, according to the nature of the country
and the work required of him. W hen approaching to thorough-
bred, he may be a splendid animal, but he will be hardly fitted for
hiswork j his legs will be too slender, his feet too small, his stride
too long, and he will rarely be able to trot. Three parts, or half,
and for the horse of all work even less than that, will make a
good and useful animal. The hackney should be a hunter in
miniature, with these exceptions: —His height should rarely exceed
15h. lin. He will be sufficiently strong and more pleasant for
general work below that standard. He should be of more compact
form than the hunter, and have more bulk according to his height,
for he has not merely to stand an occasional although severe
burst, but a great deal of everyday work.
It is of essential consequence that the bones beneath the knee
should be deep and flat, and the tendon not tied in. The pastern
should be short, and although oblique or slanting, yet far less so
than that of the racehorse, and considerably less than that of the
hunter. There should be obliquity enough to give pleasant action,
but not enough to render the horse incapable of the wear and tear
of constant, sometimes hard work. Of the intelligence of the
hackney many instances are recorded. In Cunnyngham’s “ History
of N.SiW.,” vol. 1, p. 298, he says : —“ A friend of mine in the
habit of riding a good deal found that whenever he approached a
gully his horse always opposed his wish to cross at the particular
spot he had been accustomed to, always endeavouring to bear off
to another part of the gully, where no passage was known to exist
by his rider. Resolving to see whither the horse would go, he
gave him the rein, and soon found himself taken over the gully


by a route he had never before followed. Still, however, thinking
that the former way was the nearest, he was curious enough to
have both measured, when he found the horse’s judgment correct,
that way being the nearest by several hundred yards.” The
carriage horse is a profitable description to breed, and is to be
produced from the class of mare once known in the colony as the
Cleveland mare, put to a horse of sufficient height and quality to
produce the animal desired. A good upstanding three-fourths
bred mare with such a horse as Denmark (exhibited at our last
show by Mr. Woodhouse, of Appin) would produce admirable
carriage horses, or the imported horse Shakespeare (lately owned
by Mr. Cleave, of Bungurrabbee) with a roomy, well-actioned
mare, would give the desired kind. The carriage horse should be
tall, deep-chested, well up in the withers, with good slanting
shoulders, flat in the legs, and with sufficient strength for his work.
The knee action and high lifting of the feet in the carriage horse
is deemed an excellence because it adds to the grandeur of his
appearance, but it is necessarily accompanied by much wear and
tear of the legs and feet, and this becomes very soon apparent.
The cavalry horse is likely to be much sought for in the Australian
colonies for the requirements of the Indian service, and contains a
different proportion of blood, according to the nature of the service
required or the caprice of the commanding officer. Those of the
Household Troops are from half to three-fourths bred. Some of
the lighter regiments have more blood in them. The English
cavalry horses were formerly large and heavy \ to his imposing
size was added action as imposing. The horse was trained to a
beautiful and grand method of going, but he was often found
deficient in real service, for this very action diminished his speed
and added to his Ilabour and fatigue.
A great change has taken place in the character of the English
war-horses. Eightness and activity have succeeded to bulk and
strength, and for skirmishing and sudden attack the change is an
improvement. It is particularly found to be so in the long run
and rapid marches, which the lighter troops scarcely regard, while
the heavy horses, with their more comparative weight to carry,
are knocked up.
The following anecdote of the' memory and discipline of the
troop horse is related on good authority —“ The Tyrolese in one
of the insurrections took 15 Bavarian horses and mounted them
with so many of their own men, but in a skirmish with the
squadron of the same regiment, no sooner did these horses hear
the trumpet and recognise the uniform of their old masters than
they set off at full gallop and carried their riders, in spite of all
their efforts, into the Bavarian ranks, where they were made
prisoners.”


A. sacred writer, more than 3000 years ago, gives us a sublime
account of the manner in which the horse at that time, as at the
present, entered into the spirit of the battle (Job, 39): “ Hast
thou given the horse strength 1 Hast thou clothed his neck with
thunder ? Gainst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper 1 The
glory of his nostrils is terrible ; he paweth in the valley and
rejoiceth in his strength ; he goeth on to meet the armed men ;
he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted, neither turneth he back
from the sword. The quiver rattleth against him the glittering
spear and the shield. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness
and rage, neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
He saith among the trumpets, ‘ Ha! ha !’ he smelleth the battle
afar off, the thunder of the captains and the shouting.”
As the cavalry horse is likely to be a saleable article, being
useful for nearly every purpose, lie vyill, no doubt, be a profitable
description of a horse to breed, and would be produced from a
sound, roomy mare with plenty of bone and three-parts bred, or,
what would be more suitable, a thoroughbred stallion, if the proper
class of horse could be got. The tendency of our horses from
thoroughbred stock to weediness and lightness of bone is so great
that the utmost care is necessary in selecting a stallion whose
compactness, constitution, and symmetry generally would warrant
the breeder in putting mares to him, for it is indisputable that a
very great proportion of the country breeders, and more particu-
larly where blood alone has been so prominently regarded, have
produced a lot of useless weeds, which have been sold in the
various markets of the colony where their prices have been
measured by shillings instead of pounds. Many year's ago the
Australian horses, or Walers as they were termed, were considered
by far tire best that reached the Indian market; their good qualities
and the suitability for cavalry purposes were very generally
admitted, and no doubt if we could send the same sort of horses
now they would be eagerly bought up, but unfortunately we have
not got them. lam in the hope, however, that if the profit to be
derived from producing good weight-carrying and cavalry horses
be considered by our farmers, and graziers that more attention
would be given to the pursuit, and we may hope to witness the
result in a few years.
I believe in Victoria they have been successful in their studs in
producing cavalry horses and weight carriers and hunters, where
they have had recourse to the active and well-built draught stallion
with the half or three-fourths bred mare; and I think, on the
whole, to the general breeder it would be found to be more
successful to try these strains. Though an earnest believer in the
blood horse for nearly every purpose, I cannot help thinking that
they require more care and far greater attention in the selection
and adaptation of the sexes. More than this, from the number of


weakly and weedy animals all through the country, it were better
to get back to bone and substance ; and this, I feel, is more likely
to be surmounted by the means already mentioned. Our position
on comparison with Victoria is sometimes unfavourably referred
to, on the deficiency of that class of weight-carrying horses which
we may call hunters ; still I can recollect, and it must be in the
recollection of old colonists, that we had at one time as good
horses of this class here as could be found, I venture to say, out
of England ; and I think in the early days of Melbourne and
Adelaide some of them reached these markets, where they did not
fail to distinguish themselves. I have only to name Highflyer,
British Yeoman, Wallaby, Black Prince, and Slasher to awaken
the memory of many residents of Sydney to the quality and
wonderful performances in the hunting field and across country of
these horses and many others of a similar description. Of late
years this description of horse has not been so numerous in the
colony, and this may be traced to several causes; the discontinuance
of what were known as welter races, to the abandonment of
steeplechases, and the old English sport of hunting having died
out.
I shall say very little on the subject oLthe draught horse.
Fortunately we have a valuable class of this description in the
colony. We have had frequent importations from Europe, which
have kept up their character, and although the Victorian and
New Zealand breeders some years back bought up the choice of
our breeding mares, I think it will be found that we have
sufficient for local uses, and for export if the demand were for
these horses in any number.
Some years ago a very fine class of roadster was produced in the
colony, the progeny of some valuable Arab sires, which the
enterprise of some of the early colonists supplied. These, so
far as I am aware, were not put to any special description of
mare; simply the ordinary breeding or hackney mare, and the
activity, spirit, and powers of endurance of these horses were very
remarkable. They were perfect hackneys, well built, and though
not generally not very high, were capable of getting through any
reasonable amount of work in the day, and seemingly never tired.
The colony seems to have been fortunate in those times in the
enter prise of its horse breeding, and through the spirit of those
gentlemen the colony secured a most valuable class of horse, such
indeed as we might well wish to have at the present time.
Amongst the most valuable of those Arab stallions was the horse
Satellite, whose stock most old colonists will remember as having
been very superior roadsters.
This valuable animal was imported, I believe, in 1824, by Sir
Thomas Brisbane. He was a beautiful bay, and stood little more


than 14 hands, with perfect symmetry, combined with length,
breadth, depth, and muscle, sufficient to furnish the mounted
police corps of the colony with troop horses which could scarcely
be overweighted or over-ridden. Satellite served at first for the
Government in the Wellington district, afterwards in the stud of
the late Colonel Dumaresq, at St. Helier’s, on the Hunter, and
finally at Camden Park, where he died.
Model, also, was a very successful sire. He was imported by
Mr. Brown, of Abbotsbury, and showed very high cast.
Legislator was a grey Arab, showing extremely high cast, and
was imported by Mr. Richard Jones, of Bay ley Park. Abdallah
was well known in the Bathurst district, where he served in the
stud of Captain Piper,
In addition to these were Rainbow, imported by the Hon,
Captain Rous, in the Rainbow frigate; SalaJin, Derweut Arab,
imported, I think, by the Messrs. Macarthur; Needjei, imported
by Captain Apperley ; Phantom, Crab, Akbar, and others. I
believe there are some studs in the colony where the Arab strain
is still to be found, though rarely showing out so prominently as
in the earlier days. Let us hope that the enterprise of Messrs.
White and D mgar, who have gone to the trouble and expense of
importing some very fine Arab stallions, will be crowned with
success, and that the Hunter District shall again have the merit
of supplying us with some of these very valuable horses which
the colony has so long missed. Many opinions exist as to the
relative merits of the English horse as compared to the Arab ;
and though the best judges regard the English blood horse as by
far the most perfect of its kind, it must he admitted that in this
colony the Arabs have produced some of the most useful horses
we have had on the turf. However, both here and elsewhere, the
English blood has always occupied the premier position. The
beautiful tales of Eastern countries and remote times may lead
us to imagine that the Arabian horses possess marvellous powers,
but it cannot admit of a doubt that the English trained horse is
more beautiful and far swifter and stouter than the justly-famed
courser of the Desert. On the burning plains of the East and
the frozen climate of Russia he has invariably beaten every
antagonist on his native ground. Some years ago Recruit, an
English horse of moderate reputation, easily beat Pyramis, the
best Arabian on the Bengal side of India. It will be admitted,
I think, also, that the Walers have held a very successful place on
the turf in India and China; most of the horses sent from here
have held the first places on the turf at Madras, Calcutta, and
Hongkong.
The Arab horse is as celebrated for its docility and good temper
as for its speed and courage. In Bishop Heber’s narrative of a


journey through the upper provinces of India, the following
character is given of him :—“ My morning rides are very pleasant.
My horse is a nice, quiet, good-tempered, little Arab, who is so
fearless that he eats bread out of my hand, and has almost as
much attachment and coaxing ways as a dog. This seems the
general character of the Arab horses, to judge from what I have
seen in this country. It is not the fiery, dashing animal I had
supposed, but with more rationality about him and more apparent
confidence in his rider than the majority of English horses.”
The following anecdote of the attachment of an Arab to his
mare has often been told, but it comes home to the breast of every
One possessed of common feeling ;—“The whole stock of an Aiab
of the desert consisted of a mare. The French Consul offered to
purchase her to send to his sovereign. The Arab would have
rejected the proposal at once with indignation and scorn, but he
was miserably poor; he had no means of supplying his most
urgent wants, or procuring the barest necessaries of life. Still
he hesitated ; he had scarcely a rag to cover him, and his wife
and children were starving. The sum offered was great, it would
provide him and his family with food for life. At length, and
reluctantly, he consented. He brought the mare to the dwelling
of the Consul; he dismounted ; he stood leaning upon her ; he
looked now at the gold, and then at his favourite ; he sighed ; he
wept. ‘To whom is it,’ said he, ‘I am going to yield thee up ?
To Europeans, who will tie thee close ; who will beat thee; who
will render thee miserable ; return with me, my beauty, my jewel,
and rejoice the hearts of my children.’ As he pronounced the
last words, he sprung upon her back, and was out of sight in a
moment.”
Sir John Malcolm gives two anecdotes of the same purpose, but
of a more amusing nature.
“When the envoy, returning from his former mission, was
encamped near Bagdad, an Arab rode a bright bay mare of
extraordinary shape and beauty before his tent, until he attracted
his attention. On being asked if he would sell her, ‘ What will
you give me,’ was the reply. ‘ That depends upofi her age; I
suppose she is over five?’ ‘Guess again,’ said he. 4 Four.’
4 Look at her mouth,’ said the Arab, with a smile. On examina-
tion she was found to be rising three. This, from her size and
symmetry, greatly enhanced her value. The envoy said, 4 1 will
give you fifty tomans ’ (a coin nearly the value of a pound
sterling). 4 A little more, if you please,’ said the fellow,
apparently entertained. 4 Eighty ! a hundred !’ He shook his
head and smiled. The offer at last reached two hundred tomans !
4 Well,’ said the Arab, 4 you need not tempt me further—it is of
no use. You are a rich elachee (nobleman). You have fine


horses, camels, and mules, and I am told you have loads of silver
and gold. Now, you want my mare ; but you shall not have her
for all you have got.’ ” —Malcolm’s “ Sketches of Persia.”
An Arab sheik or chief, who lived within fifty miles of
Bussorah, had a favourite breed of horses. He lost one of his
best mares. He could not for a long time discover whether she
was stolen or had strayed. Some time after, a young man of a
different tribe, who had long wished to marry his daughter, but
had always been rejected by the sheik, obtained the lady’s con-
sent, and eloped with her. The sheik and his followers pursued,
but the lover and his mistress, mounted on one horse, made a
powerful march and escaped. The old chief swore that the fellow
was either mounted on the devil or the favourite mare he had
lost. After his return he found the latter was the case ; that the
lover was the thief of his mare as,well as his daughter, and that
he stole one to carry off the other. The chief was quite gratified
to think he had not been beaten by a mare of another breed ;
and was easily reconciled to the young man, in order that he
might recover the mare, which appeared an object about which he
was more solicitous than about his daughter.
Major Denham affords us a pleasing instance of the attachment
with which the docility and sagacity of the horse may inspire its
owner. He thus relates the death of his favourite Arab in one
of the most desert spots in Central Africa: —There are a few
situations in a man’s life in which losses of this nature are felt
most keenly, and this was one of them. It was not grief, but it
was something very nearly approaching to it ; and though I felt
ashamed of the degree of derangement I suffered from it, yet it
was several days before I could get over the loss. Let it be
remembered, however, that the poor animal had been my support
and comfort—nay, I may say companion, through many a dreary
day and night ; had endured boch hunger and thirst in ray
service, and was so docile that he would stand still for hours in
the desert while I slept between his legs, Ids body affording me
the only shelter that could be obtained from the powerful influence
of a noonday sun. He was yet the fleetest of the fleet, and ever
foremost in the chase.”
I shall now refer to the important subject of breeding, which
becomes particularly important when there can be no doubt the
breed of useful horses has of late years most materially de-
generated. Our race-horses are the most successful in the
colonies, our draught meet all the requirements of the
country, but our hackneys, weight-carriers, and harness horses
are not by any means what they used to be. This may be
attributed, perhaps, in a large measure, in the first instance, to
the general panic which overtook the pastoral and grazing


interests of the colony many years ago, when horses, in common
with cattle and sheep, became very nearly valueless. At this stage,
breeding mares and stallions were permitted to run wild until
they increased in herds through the different districts of the
colony. In the pastoral districts, particularly, has this been the
case. Until within the last few years, these necessarily ill-bred
and useless weeds were found to become so numerous, that their
destruction became a necessity, to preserve the grass consumed
by them for cattle and sheep; and it is not uncommon to hear of
the destruction of these animals by the hundred. In many cases,
where practicable, they are driven to pound, where they are
bought at prices from Is. upwards, and in some cases they have
had to be destroyed, being found absolutely valueless. Of course,
it would hardly be expected that horses reared in this way could
be of any value, though, in some instances perhaps, five or ten out
of a hundred maybe secured and sent to the Sydney or Melbourne
market. In the more central districts, through the low price of
horse stock, farmers and graziers have given little or no attention
to horse-breeding, and, between one cause and the other, the
valuable breed of useful roadsters, hackneys, and dog-cart or
carriage horses which the colony was once so noted for, has com-
pletely died out. Once, the farmer and grazier took pains in
the rearing and producing of this class of horses, which was a
profitable item in his yearly product, and he could readily find
purchasers at from thirty to eighty and a hundred guineas; now,
however, this class of animal is rarely to be met with. We may
hope, however, that the stimulus offered to horse-breeders, by the
increased price in the Sydney market, and by the inducements
held out by the Indian Government, will have the effect of arrest-
ing their attention to this industry, and that it will result in our
restoring the reputation we have lost, not only in the local
markets, but in the extensive markets of Calcutta, Madras and
Bombay.
With the object of breeding the more useful class of upstanding
weight-carrier or harness horse, the first consideration will be the
selection of the required number of mares—and it is by far more
profitable to have a less number, properly and carefully selected
and cared for, than a large number carelessly selected, and not
sufficiently attended to afterwards—and I am afraid that this
will be found the greatest obstacle to the intending breeder. It
is essential, however, that this important consideration be strictly
regarded, and though it is possible that their selection will be a
work of some time it is better to wait.until the required number
of suitable descriptions be gradually procured, for out of a weedy
or ill-constituted mare, let the horse be as perfect as he may, a
good foal will rarely be produced. It is preferable that the mat es
be young and vigorous, and especially devoid of constitutional


deformities, these being peculiarly hereditary in horses. These
may be put to the horse described at a previous part of this
paper ; and the important consideration, then, will be to provide
suitable pasture, for during the tirst and second years of a horse’s
age, it is essential that he be not stinted in food. We are
fortunate in having a climate where horses may be successfully
reared with little or no housing, though it cannot be doubted that
all stock would be better if protected from the stormy and
inclement winter rains. The foal should be weaned at about six or
seven months, and this is a critical time in its life; and if left at
grass, it should be the object of the owner to see that there is
sufficient nutritive grass in the paddock into which it is put, but
it would be far better if the young stock at this age were provided
with lucerne or barley, as the more valuable description of stock
at this age will, no doubt, be stable-fed; and, while on this
subject, I would strongly urge the - use of oats —indeed, for all
kinds of young stock—in preference to maize ; it is more easily
masticated, but more than this, its analysis has shown that it
contains the muscle-producing property of which maize is deficient.
If, then, the foal be well-fed, particularly during the cold and frosty
months of winter, and during the time of his losing his nippers
or front teeth, he will be found to thrive and grow quickly after-
wards, and will well remunerate its owner for the care and trouble
bestowed upon him. When the breaking process arrives, which
will be most likely at three years old, great care should be had by
the owner that the thorough breaking and training to quiet use
should be the first and important consideration witli the breaker,
and not the testing of his own skill and prowess in sitting his
horse while buck-jumping. Many of our hcrses have been taught
this habit from the breaker backing him with unnecessary haste
before it has been trained to carry the saddle. How many
instances are known of country breakers yarding the colt one day,
and buckling a saddle on and mounting him the next. This may
be well as a test of the skill of the rider, but it is teaching the
horse a habit which it rarely or never forgets, and numerous
instances are known of horses that have been ridden for years
recurring to this pernicious habit after a tew weeks turn-out at
grass.
Respecting the encouragement to be given to the breeding of
the more useful class of horse, it seems to me that the Society has
already given and offered liberal prizes for competition, and I
think the main encouragement to be given will be found in the
prices that the breeders will get in the local and Indian markets
when the proper sort of horse shall have been produced.
A gentleman in the south country interested in the breeding of
horses has proposed a horse-tax, the proceeds of which he would
devote to a large prize at Rand wick ; also, one at the Society s


Annual Exhibition. To do this, legislation would be necessary,
and it is probable that great obstacles would be thrown in the
way of a measure of this character.
That horse-breeding is a useful industry in connection with
farming and grazing cannot be doubted, if properly carried out
and in a national point of view it has yielded a large annual
return to the colony.
His Excellency the Nawab Mooktan 001-Moolk, Sir Salar Jung,
K.C.5.1., Ruler of the Deccan, India, has been pleased to signify
his desire to endow a company formed in Australia for specia y
breeding and selecting weight carrying horses for the supply of
his troops and dominions, and has for that purpose grantee ->y
that deed : _Twenty years’ lease of a rumnah or station, containing
6000 acres of grazing and 3000 agricultural land, at a nominal
rent. The privilege of landing all goods required for the rumnah
free of duty. The privilege of the special warrant of his Highness,
which commands the labour and assistance required by the
company. To subsidise the company with a sum equivalent to
£9300 viz £IOOO on landing 100 mares, £IOOO towards expenses
of enclosing the rumnah, and £3OO for erecting superintendents
dwelling.
Colonel Thornhill, in a letter on the subject, writes “My
experience in Osoor has forced upon me the belief that it the
Australian dealers were more properly managed, the Indian.army
could be mounted from that country in a manner that no army in
the world has ever yet been horsed. If the Government will allow
only ten horses to be purchased for their service, why should the
dealers bring another class of animal ?
Mr. Lackey also read the following despatch from the Secretary
of the Government of India :
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sydney, 7th May, 1873.
The following notice, transmitted by the Secretary to the
Government of India, regarding the purchase of remounts required
for the Bengal Army, is published for general information.—Henry
Parkes.— “Notice.—It having been decided by the Government
of India to establish a reserve of 1000 horses for army use, and
for the next few years to purchase a considerable number ot
remounts for the Bengal army in the open market, notice is hereby
aiven that remount committees at the several stations of Calcutta,
Allahabad, Cawnpore, Lucknow, Agra, Meerut, Umballa, Lahore,
Sealkote, Rawul, Pindee, and Peshawur, are prepared to purchase
horses suitable for army purposes to the number of about 1-00,
during the current year and up to the Ist April, 18/4.


“ In 1874-75, 1000 horses, and in 1875-76, 650 tiorses more or
less, will be bought. The requirements of subsequent years will
be made known hereafter. t , T >
“ Horses of all breeds- -Cape, Australian, Arab, Persian,
Country-bred, and Northern will be accepted if up to the

“ Mares, as well as horses, will be taken, and if the former are
of good stamp, the preference will be given to them
“ They must be within the prescribed ages— four to seven
“ The maximum pi ice for cavalry and field artillery remounts
to 500 rupees, for horse artillery 600 rupees.
“ The following, prizes will also be given for English and Colonial
stock exhibited at Calcutta in the early part of January, 1874.

“ It is also notified that the following prizes will be awarded at
two stations, one in the North-west Provinces, and one in the
Puniaub, the time and place of exhibition to be fixed shortly, and
similar prizes are offered for country-bred horses. The rupee is
equal, in India, to two shillings sterling
“Some prizes will also be given in 1875 and following years,
the details of which will be published in due course.
“ The Government of India will retain a right of pre-emption

Mr. Lackey
was warmly applauded upon resuming
his seat.
Sir William Macarthur moved that the thanks ot the Council
be presented to Mr. Lackey for his valuable paper. He wished to
guard himself from being
supposed to indorse all that Mr. .Lackey
had advanced.
He thought that the discussion ot
the subject
would
come more conveniently after the paper had appeared in
print.
Captain Mann seconded the motion. With regard to cavalry
horses he said that temper
was one
of the most essential requisites
flrmv S
ervice ; and in his early days he

for horses in the Indian army service ; and in his early days he
had seen many first-class horses rejected for cavalry purposes solely
on that ground. When he was in the service the whole of the
Bombay army horses were entires, and the presence of a gelding
caused greater disturbance amongst them, than even that of a
mare. The consequence was that many valuable horses, adapted
in all other respects for cavalry use, were not purchased by
the Government. Had horses of that description been sent m
sufficient number to horse one troop or one regiment, they would
have been bought at a high price. He believed that N.B. Wales
horses, if produced with a good temper and in sufficient number,
would invariably command the Indian market, as military
horses.
Mr. J. J. Calvert called the attention of the meeting to a new
book, entitled “ Newmarket and Arabiaa few copies only had,
as yet, reached the colony. The author entered into the whole
question of breeding horses in England, and for the supply ot
the Indian mnrket, and his work was one of the best extant.
Mr. A. A. Hangar endorsed Mr. Calvert’s opinion of Captain
Upton’s book. With respect to the breeding ot hacks, he thought


that good horses of that description would never be bred in the
colony until a tax was put upon horses so as to lead to the exter-
mination of the swarms of useless animals which now infested
the country.
The Chairman apprehended that there would be no difference
of opinion as to the propriety of offering our most cordial thanks
to Mr. Lackey for his very able and interesting paper. After all,
he imagined that the improvements in the breeding of horses must,
like improvements in all industries and enterprises, be brought to
the practical test of what would pay. That was a question which
could, no doubt, be best dealt with by those who had been
practically engaged in the breeding of horses in this country ; but
he should just like to observe that, coming to this country as a
stranger, but as one having some acquaintance with the breeding
of horses, the very unfavourable impression which he formed of
the Australian horses on his first arrival, some 15 months ago,
had been very much modified by subsequent observations. He
thought that it might be said of Australian horses generally that
they were a great deal better than they looked, lake the race-
horse first of all. The racehorses of the colony struck him, when
he came here, as being very deficient both in size and power; but
on looking into the question he found that as regarded speed,
steadiness, and capacity for running distances and carrying
weight they would compare favourably with the best class of
English racehorses. The mean average speed of the English
Derby up to 1862 was, he found, 2 minutes 53£ seconds, while
that of the Sydney Derby was 2 minutes 48 seconds, and heie the
horses carried 51bs. more than they did in England. Since 1862,
the weights had been revised, and, like the distances, were the same
in each case. The mean speed was exactly the same, namely,
2 minutes 48 seconds. But there was this difference, that the
Sydney horses, though legally three years old, were, in fact, not
more than two years and nine or ten months when they ran for
the Derby, whereas the English horses were generally three years
and four months old. The comparison was thus greatly to the
advantage of the colonial thoroughbred ; and if it were necessary
to add criterion, he might take the last race between Reprieve
and Dagworth, when the distance of three miles was run in 5
minutes 57£ seconds, the race resulting in a dead heat. The
deciding heat was then run in 5 minutes 56 seconds, or
seconds less—an example of strength, speed and enduiance
of which he scarcely remembered to have known a parallel.
The fine prizes offered here had created a demand for first-
class thoroughbreds; the supply had followed as a natural
consequence, and the racehorses bred in New Boulh Wales
would compare very favourably with the best class of thorough-
breds. With regard to cart horses, he thought that the


heavy draught cart horses which he had seen in Sydney, in the
provincial towns, and in those parts of the colony which he had
visited, were quite equal to anything he had seen in the world.
They had plenty of weight and quite sufficient action. What
remained was just the great bulk of the light draught and saddle
horses scattered over the country, and he thought, as a general
rule, that these were also better than they looked. They did not
compare favourably in either appearance and condition with the
same class of horses in England, but then they were brought up
in a totally different way. In England, almost all brood mares
and foals had a certain amount of feed, and they were always
housed in winter and bad weather. Here, however, it might be
said that horses ran wild until they were five years old; they
received no housing, grooming, or feed, and it would therefore be
unreasonable to expect that animals produced almost like game
should compete in appearance with animals brought up in England
under very different conditions. He thought they were superior
to horses of the same class in England. They were hardier, more
active, more healthy; there was less unsoundness and fewer broken
knees among them, although they received less feeding, grooming,
and stabling. When they were taken up from the grass they
would do any amount of work, both in' saddle and harness,
greater, he believed, than the ordinary class of English horses
would perform when in the very best condition. It was a mistake
to suppose that the horses of the colony were very greatly
deteriorated. He thought they were animals of a very useful
description, and that they suited the purposes required. No
doubt, with an expenditure of money, they could be improved.
If they were kept in paddocks, if sheds were provided for shelter,
if when grass was scarce they received a certain amount of other
food, if the young colts were castrated at a proper time, and the
fillies were not allowed to be got in foal until they attained a
proper age and development, a corresponding improvement would
be effected. It was a mere matter of money, and the question was
whether the increased value would be commensurate with the
additional outlay The only animals of which we were deficient
were those which we might style fancy animals— horses which
were produced under exceptional conditions, and at a very consider-
able cost, and for which the demand, at all events at remunerative
prices, was, he believed, extremely limited. The animals to which
he referred were what Mr. Lackey had described as well-bred,
fast-going, weight-carrying hunters—horses which could carry
four teen °stone at a great pace, and over difficult country with
perfect success. An animal of that description would fetch £2OO
at home. They had not got it here, because there was no demand
for it; and, if they were produced, they would not sell at a price
that would pay. So, also, with regard to hacks, which could


canter at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles an hour. At home
they would command £IOO, but he doubted whether they would
bring more than £SO here. The London carriage horse, 16 hands
2 inches, well-bred, sinewy, with high knee action, was an animal
that was not seen here. He could only be produced at very con-
siderable cost, and there would be no considerable demand for
him, either here or in India. Fifteen or twenty years ago horses
of that class used to be produced in New South Wales, for he had
seen them in Ceylon and India, and he concluded they were
not produced now because it would not pay. If there were a
demand for these fancy articles they would be forthcoming. All
essential requisites were in the colony—good mares, good horses,
a fine climate, plenty of grass, and men who were fully alive to
their own interests. If there were a demand it would be supplied,
and, if there were no demand, the Agricultural Society would do
no good by stimulating people to produce an article which they
would be able only to dispose of at a loss, as was the case in former
times. The only way in which good could be done, was to
stimulate the demand, and the supply would take care of
itself. He saw that it was proposed to give £25 for the
best stallion suitable for all purposes. He should be sorry
to be a judge in that class. A horse that was suitable for one
purpose was not for another, and he was unable to understand
how a stallion could be suitable for all. If the Society were to
reduce that prize to £5, and if they felt any inclination to dispose
of the other £2O, he thought they would be doing a good deal
more good by giving it to the Sydney fox-hounds—(laughter)—
and thus lead to a demand for a class of horses which did not at
present exist. Or, if they did not care about doing that, he would
suggest that they should give it for the best four-in-hand team,
and thus create a demand for horses of that description among the
young men of the country. He merely mentioned this to illustrate
his idea that any action which the Society might take should be
in the direction of stimulating demand.
The motion was unanimously agreed to, and Mr. Lackey
appropriately acknowledged the compliment.
THE HERALD'S REMARKS.
Mr. Lackey on Horses and Horse-breeding.
One of the most instructive and interesting papers it has ever
been our fortune to see in print was read before the Royal Society
of New South Wales on Wednesday last by Mr. Lackey, M.P. for


Central Cumberland. The subject was, “ The best means of
improving the breed, and encouraging the breeding of the more
valuable kinds of horses.” Mr. Lackey, having given a brief
review of the history of the breeding of thoroughbred horses for
racing purposes, showed that notwithstanding the successes
achieved on the turf by New South Wales horses, the results, as a
whole, on the breed of horses were very far from satisfactory, too
much attention having been paid to the acquisition of such qualities
in the horse as will enable it to get over the greatest amount of
ground in the least possible time. The consequence was that
thousands of horses now infested the country, of no value beyond
what could be realised from the sale of their hides. The great
desideratum in the studs of New South Wales is, Mr. Lackey
says, “ the roadster, the charger, and the carriage horse, the
breeding of these having been neglected for the sake of the racer.
Mr. Lackey said :
“X am not aware of any breeder who has devoted his atten-
tion exclusively to the production of either of these three useful
descriptions of horses. Let us hope, however, now that the
requirements of the colony have largely increased, the Indian
market promises a large demand, and the pastoral prospects of
the colony are now in so prosperous a condition, that breeders
will give their attention to the production of these useful and
valuable animals. In this our Victorian friends are far before us,
and have succeeded in the production of the roadster or hackney,
the carriage horse, and the hunter ; so much so indeed, that the
large amounts which used to find their way to the coffers of this
colony for horses suitable to the Indian market, are now reaped
by the Victorian breeder.
“ Whilst on the subject of blood horses, I would take the
opportunity of remarking that we have amongst the blood stock
of the colony stallions capable of producing almost any of the
more useful description of horses. To do this, however, due and
careful regard must be had in the first place to the description of
horse it is desired to produce, and the first axiom laid down
by the best authorities on the horse is that ‘like will produce like.’
It should be a careful consideration with the breeder that the
qualities of the sire and dam be so adjusted that any failing on
the part of either be compensated by a special quality on the part
of the other.”
The Royal Society would, we think, act wisely in publishing
and distributing gratis Mr. Lackey’s very valuable paper.


REMINISCENCES OF HORSE RACING AND SPORTING
IN THE EARLY DAYS.
Published in Centennial Magazine , Aug., 1888.
BY JOHN LACKEY, M.L.C.
Thirty years ago I had the opportunity, through my official
connection with the Parramatta Races, as steward and treasurer,
of having placed in ray possession the official records of the races
which took place in that town as far back as the year 1841. I
often think of them and bring before my mind some of those, now
long passed away, who were, as racing men, the founders of
sport in Australia; and to those who maintain the beneficial
influence upon society of a sympathy with a thorough sporting
character, it will be gratifying to know that some of the best men
in the Colonies then fairly represented its intelligence, character,
and patriotism in their public identification with sporting events.
Let me take, for example, the first of these records upon which
1 then looked. It contains the names, amongst stewards, of
William Lawson, senior, Captain Weston, of Horsley—a man who
was a true sportsman, and who did much to promote good sport in
the early days of colonization, and who originally came from
India, and I believe introduced the first pack of hounds, of which
for many years he was master, in this country. The place where
the hounds were located was a spot well known to all travellers
on the old Western Road in times long gone by. It was known as
the “ Dog Kennels,” and amongst those who are old enough now to
remember its associations, it is still known by the same name. By
the way, I may mention in connection with this pack of hounds,
that in the person of a man of substantial fortune and good com-
mercial position in the city of Sydney at the present moment, I
recognise, after more than forty years, the handsome little boy
who in scarlet coat and top boots rode with those hounds, per-
forming the functions of whip to the pack.
Another of the stewards was Mr. G. Kemp, then the owner of
the estate which is now known as “ Fleurs,” situated on a tributary
of South Creek, called after Mr. Kemp; ancher was Mr. Nelson
Lawson, who built the homestead at “ Graystaines,” the present
estate of another sporting man, Mr. A. F. Smart, one of the modern
race of sportsmen ; and another was Mr. John Rose Holden,
one of the truest sportsmen we, perhaps, ever possessed in
Australia. He came here as a mere boy, a lieutenant in an
infantry regiment, settled down, and from the day of his landing
till his departure, which was the larger portion of his life, gave
his influence and assistance to the cultivation of honest, manly


sport in this country. He was a dashing rider, a constant atten-
dant at all public race meetings, and had at all times a great deal
to do with the management of the turf. The Judge of those races
was Mr. W. K. Kenny, more familiarly known as Dr. Kenny.
He was a true type of British gentleman, and resided on his estate
near Campbelltown, now known as Kenny s Hill, the proposed
alternate site of the Sydney Water supply. In that locality he
practised his profession, enjoying universal respect, and regarded
as one of the best judges of horses —one to be called in and give a
professional opinion at any time—and was always to be found at
turf gatherings, occupying a prominent and respected place. The
clerk of the course was Mr. James Watsford, junior, whose
brother, who without ever obtaining, as far as I know, a medical
degree, has been addressed as the “ Doctor for the past fifty
years, happily still exists, and of whom my early remembrances
extend long before the days of railways, when he drove a spank-
ing team between Sydney and Parramatta.
I find that in the very first race run on the first day of the
races to which I am referring, the names, amongst owners, ,of Mr.
P. Leslie, who was one of the pioneers of the Darling Downs ;
Mr. H. H. Kater, who was one of the largest importers of thorough-
bred stock from England, and who introduced besides Cap-a-pie and
Paraguay, the sire and dam of Sir Hercules, Tros, the sire of Cas-
sandra, who was the dam of the glorious Yattenden, and several other
splendid horses, and who, up to a recent period, lived in our midst
engaged in country pursuits, in which his descendants ate still
occupied, and I have as my neighbour, at Austermere, Ms eldest
son. Another of the owners was Mr. Joseph Onus, at present
residing at Richmond, and who was in that day the owner of a cele-
brated horse called Jerry Sneak —a son of one of the most famous
horses in the country, known as Whisker, of whom I shall have a
word to say presently. Another of the owners was Mr. Richard
Rouse, whose family have been identified with racing and the breed-
ing of stock for so long, and who was universally known. The last
name in the list of owners was that of Captain Hunter, better
known as Major Hunter, who was in all respects a thorough
sportsman. He was the owner at that time of a chestnut gelding,
amongst other horses, named Prince, whose sire was Camerton,
a sire that produced some of the most remarkable horses of the
colony for a mixture of [race and endurance.
Concerning this horse Prince, I may mention that he was once
backed by a Mr. Walker, a well-known sporting light-weight of
those days, to carry him 100 miles in a day, and as a boy I distinctly
remember the successful finish of that event. The course was from
Sydney to some point on the Liverpool Road, back to Sydney,
and then to Penrith and back.


Turf men will be familiar with the record of Old Camerton, who
was imported into this country about 1825, and who was said to
be the performer of one of the gamest races ever run in England,
in which four horses and himself started, and which Camerton
won. Of his competitors, one broke down, the second went blind
immediately afterwards, the third fell dead at the winning-post,
and the fourth never started again.
Among other owners of race-horses entered in other events in
this extremely interesting record from which I am quoting, I per-
ceive the names of Charles Roberts, whose name was a household
word in racing circles in those times; Captain O Connell, aftei-
wards Sir Maurice O'Connell, President of the Eegislative Council
of Queensland for so many years, and repeatedly Acting-Governor
of that colony ; Mr. Daniel Egan, better known in more modern
times as a genial, hospitable, large-hearted colonist, known also
for many years as a politician, and for a short time as a Minister
of the Crown. It is of him and of the brilliant George Robert
Nichols, who were great friends, that a story was told, which was
repeated, I believe, the other night in Parliament, by Sir Henry
Parkes, and received with much amusement and admiration. Both
Mr. Egan and Mr. Nichols had the misfortune to have their houses
simultaneously occupied by the obtrusive officers of the Sheriffs
department. Meeting, they offered to each other their condolences
an a visit so unpleasant, and Mr. Nichols having ascertained that
while he was not possessed of the means of getting rid of his visi-
tors, he had in his pocket a little more than the amount which
would enable his friend to enjoy perfect freedom in his own house,
pointed out to him at once the desirableness of taking the
money he (Mr. Nichols) possessed, and getting rid of his —a course
which Mr. Egan immediately and gratefully adopted.
Another of the owners of horses at this meeting—and I select
these men particularly because there are such a number of names,
so many of which are now forgotten, of men who at one time
played their part well in sporting events—was the brother of one
who, in more recent times, will hardly be associated with horse-
racing, and that was the late Mr. Michael Fitzpatrick, for half a
lifetime practically the head of one of the most important public
departments, and later in life one of the best informed and most
intelligent political leaders in New South Wales.
But, perhaps, of all the names appearing here, the most promi-
nent, and in his day, in connection with turf matters, the most
distinguished, was that of Mr. Charles Smith--a name still
remembered by all men who took the most superficial interest in
turf matters in those distant times. He had formed at his two
farms at Clifton, near Windsor, and Bungarribbee, on the Western
Road, very complete racing establishments. At the former place


all lovers of the turf will be interested to know that the most
famous horse in the turf annals of this country, the sire Sir Her-
cules, was foaled, and here were also bred the famous horses Bees-
wing, Little John, Bee-in-a-Bonnet, Blue Bonnet, and several
others. Mr. Smith was one of the most enterprising supporters
of the turf we have ever had, and imported some of the finest
stock. It is interesting also to notice that the name of one of our
best known families in modern times, that of Captain Lamb, also
appears. Captain Lamb, the father of Mr. Walter and Mr. John
de V. Lamb, was the importer of some very fine stock, and
amongst others of the famous Cutty Sark and Spaewife, who were
the dams, by the way, of the successful line of horses at Clifton,
bred by Mr. Charles Smith.
In one of the races I also find entered by Mr. Rouse the famed
Jorrocks, once known over the whole of New South Wales, per-
haps more affectionately and admiringly than any other of our
race-horses, and who for several years after his retirement from
the turf was kept before the eyes of the public of Sydney as the
well-known hack, ridden about rather as a reminder of his past
glories, and then always kept as if he were a race-horse, by the
well-known and popular citizen, Mr. Archie Thompson. It would
be interesting to know that at this event to which I am now allu-
ding, Jorrocks made his first appearance on the turf, and I see
before me the autograph—in the receipt of the prize—of his rider,
Mr. Roland Hassall. The event was the Members’ Purse, twice
round the course, gentlemen riders; and I had the pleasure, in
the street, a week or two back, of shaking the hand of this
gentleman rider of nearly half a century ago, and who, although
somewhat changed in appearance from that day, seems still equal,
if another Jorrocks could be found, to ride him with perhaps a
greater skill, derived from immense experience, and with happily
not very much diminished vigour.
The Parramatta records, from which I am making these refe-
rences, contain an immense mass of deeply interesting information
concerning events and men of whose names and services to the
turf the present generation is not very familiar. I have picked
out some of the more prominent active participators in the sport-
ing events of those days, and among those many whose names
were more immediately identified with the sporting life of the
country. But I might have selected the names of persons then
occupying high positions in the community, some of whom have
passed out of recollection, and some of whom are identified with
great enterprises, and some are among the most distinguished and
well-known names in its history. Of the last I need only refer to
that of William Charles Wentworth, who not only raced his own
horses, but at a time when the value of money would make his
gift one of a splendid character, in those days was the annual


giver of a prize at the Turf Club Races held at Parramatta ; of
the head of the Blaxland family; of Sir John Jamieson; of Mr.
William Cox ; of Mr. Alexander Berry ; of Colonel Dumeresqe;
of Mr. Thomas Icely, of Coombing, near Carcoar; of Colonel
Shadforth ; of Mr. Commissary-General Laidley, the father of our
well-known citizen, familiar to us all, Mr. William Laidley.
But I find the materials for an article, such as this, so crowding
in upon me, that I am beginning to entertain the apprehension
that, if it should be my good fortune to inspire any general curio-
sity in my remembrances, I shall be very laboriously, unless I am
careful, defeating it at the same time by writing at too great
length for a single number, and by estimating the interest of
others in these distant events with that which I myself feel. If
it should be my good fortune to givg.pleasure by indulging in these
reminiscences, I shall have repeated opportunities on future occa-
sions to give a number of particulars of a deeply interesting
character concerning the beginnings of sport in these great
colonies. Those beginnings will be found to have been not
unworthy of even the high places which is occupied in these
Australian communities by those who now cater for the public
entertainment on the turf.
But before I close this paper, I should like to have an oppor-
tunity of making a reference to two men, who perhaps as
much as any person who ever came to these colonies, in making
the turf worthy of public confidence and admiration, and of
Mvin" to it the character which it has ever enjoyed here.
It is not too much to say that there is not a man who now
looks upon our great racing events with pride, upon the manage-
ment of our turf* affairs with complacency, but feels how much
the happiness of those who owe a great deal of happiness to the
respectable conduct of our public entertainments and who can-
not be insensible to our obligations—is owing to the very distin-
guished men who in Australia almost laid the foundation stones
of all true sport. lam not aware that we have among our present
racing men, with the exception of His Excellency the Governor,
Sir Hercules Robinson, any of the high officers of Govern-
ment in New South Wales. We have had Colonial Secre-
taries, Judges of the Supreme Court, all the leading
military men who, from time to time, held high command s'*
here; but I think our attention should be particularly fixed
upon two great figures —one of those the greatest figure in all
modern English history in connection with turf matters, I mean
the celebrated Admiral Rous ; the other the late Sir Edward Deas
Thompson, who for the greater part of his lifetime gave his direct
patronage and assistance in the management and government of
turf affairs of the colony, and who was for a great number of
years, and up to his death, the President of the Australian Jockey


Club. I shall not speak of him at any very great length, because
there is scarcely an incident of his life which we do not know
in connection with the history of the country. No one took a
livelier and deeper interest than he did in the whole of our sport
ing life—an interest which he was privileged to preserve, by his
happy nature, almost up to the period of his death. I often used
to think, so fond was he of horses, that he thought he was under
an obligation never to be seen on one in the public streets without
the animal was one of striking character and beauty ; and there
are sporting men in our midst who, to this day, will give yon
from memory the beautiful points of the various horses ridden
by him in the streets of Sydney up to a short time of his death.
It may not be generally known, but it is a fact, that when it
was found necessary to remove the meetings of the Australian
Jockey Club from the old course at Homebush, it was he who
suggested and pointed out the suitability of the spot at present
being used at Randwick, and I well remember having the pleasure
of riding out with Sir Eciward, accompanied by the late Mr. George
Rowley, the late Mr. William McQuade, and the late Judge
Cheeke, to the site of the present racecourse, and it was on his
urgent recommendation that the works were undertaken that
resulted in the present complete racecourse.
But I feel some hesitation in speaking of one whose name
became a world-famous one on the turf—long after he had visited
Australia. It may be that there are some who have a very slight
knowledge of the fact that before he was in his own person the
great court from the judgment of which on all sporting questions
there was no appeal, he was doing his best to show us, in the
infancy of sporting life here, how to make our field sports the
pursuits of gentlemen and of men of honour, and the great enter-
tainments of the public. Henry John, second son of the Earl of
Stradbroke, known wherever the English language is spoken, and
in large parts of the world where men love sport and do not
speak the English language, came to this country as a very young
man. He had only obtained his command in the Navy a few
years before he anchored in Sydney Harbour, and in these seashe
remained for several years. Of his services as a geographer and
of his naval services, this is not the place to speak, nor am I
capable of speaking of them. He had had, as a “fighting” young-
ster, I believe, a very brilliant naval career before he obtained his
command. He came here commander of the frigate “ Rainbow,”
in 1825, when he must have been less than 30 years of age, and he
made use of His Majesty’s ship, even in those distant days, for
the purpose of introducing an accession to the then blood stock of
the country. From the time of his arrival, he took as active a
part in all the sporting events to which he could give assistance,
as if he had been sent out, not to command a man-of-war, but to


give the benefit of his peculiar knowledge to the formation of a
very important part of our national character. What, as a young
man full of energy and vigour and sympathy with the growth of
this continent, he was doing for us in our small sporting world
then, everyone now knows he did, we may say, certainly for
England and for all British dependencies which possess a race-
horse, and for those parts of Europe which includes horse-racing
among their popular sports.
But I shall again be perhaps extending this article to unreason-
able length if I pursue, which 1 hope to do early in another
number, the particulars concerning Admiral Rous, not in his own
person as the Appellate Court of the world, but as our teacher
in Australia between the time he brought out the high-class Arab
“ Rainbow,” and imported “ Emigrant.”
