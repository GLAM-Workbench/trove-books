1. The object of the Company is to make advances
on Freehold Land and Buildings, Machinery, and
other suitable property in the Fiji Islands, and to
transact Mercantile Agency business connected
with the Colony.
2. The progress of the Colony since Great Britain
assumed the sovereignty over it in October, 1874,
has been most remarkable, as is attested by the
following extracts from a paper read by Sir Arthur
Gordon, G.C.M.G., the Governor, before the Eoyal
Colonial Institute, London, in March, 1879 :
? Suffice it to say, generally, that the revenue
? of the Colony has swelled rapidly from �16,000
?in 1875 to �38,000 in 1876, �47,000 in 1877,
? and over �60,000 in 1878, while the expenditure
? has been reduced to a level with the income ;
? that the receipts from Customs, which were in
? 1875 but �B,OOO, amounted in 1878 under prac-
? tically the same tariff to �20,000 ; that the im-
? ports have nearly doubled in value, and the
? exports (which exceed the imports) have quite
? done so; that the Polynesian labourers whose
? terra of service had expired have been conveyed
? home and replaced by labour newly recruited;
? that more than 800 land titles have been settled
? after laborious and minute investigation; that
? measures have been passed by the Legislative
? Council which do honour to those who framed
? them, and compare favourably with those of many
? older Colonies ; that the Government service has


been organised, Courts of Law established, that
a dangerous disturbance has been put down
quickly, cheaply, and effectually ; that capital
is being invested; and that, after a care-
ful investigation, extending over more
than a year, it has been reported to me by
most competent and most cautious scientific
authority, that the annual value of the
agricultural exports of the Colony, when
its powers of production have been fully de-
veloped, will probably exceed �10,000,000
sterling.?
* * * * *
? Everywhere the increased areas of cultivation,
the enlarged towns, the good new houses, the
well-kept roads, the cheerful and healthy looking
population, present the strongest possible con-
trast to the aspect of the country in 1875.?
? I will only say one word on the future
spects of the Colony, ? namely, that I believe
Fiji to be an admirable field lor the invest-
ment of large capital, whether in sugar
or coffee estates. Sugar grows sponta-
neously, is of the first quality, and has a
practically boundless market in Australia.
As regards coffee culture, Fiji is now in
much the same position as Ceylon thirty
or forty years ago, and I have no doubt
that those who now found estates there,
will find them in no long time amply re-
munerative. I have never seen finer
tobacco than that raised in Fiji, and the
cotton produced there is admitted to be
of the best description.?


3. With regard to the products and capabilities
of the Colony, a Report has been made by John
Horne, Esq., F.L.S., Director of the Botanical
Gardens and Woods and Forests of Mauritius, by
desire of Sir Arthur Gordon, in which Mr. Horne
remarks upon the size, healthy appearance, and
rapid growth of the sugar cane in Fiji, and adds,
? the extent and richness of these lands in conjunc-
? tion with a climate extremely favourable for
? growing and maturing the sugar cane, ought
? to make all well-wishers of Fiji long the
? time when sugar will be made in it, and
? exported by the hundred thousand tons,
? and to the value of millions of pounds
? sterling.?
? These islands contain large areas of
? almost incomparably fine coffee land, and
? enjoy a climate which is at once healthy and
? well adapted for the growth of the Coffee tree,
? plant, or bush. Coffee will be second to none
? except sugar in value. Its export value
? will ultimately attain to about a million
" and a half or two millions sterling.?
As to Copra (the dried kernel of the cocoa-nut,
at present the leading item of Fiji produce, and
from which cocoa-nut oil is made), the Cocoa-nut
tree grows to perfection ; 80 trees to the acre,
yielding about 6,000 nuts, produce one ton of
Copra, worth in Levuka, the capital of Fiji, �l4 a
ton, besides fibre worth about �ls a ton, and in
London, �2l to �23 respectively. At present
nearly the whole of the valuable fibre is thrown
away. In Ceylon the copra is crushed on the spot
into oil, every bit of fibre turned to account, and
the oil is shipped to London and sold at �3B a
tun. If proper machinery were introduced the
present annual loss to the Colony of something


like �50,000 would be saved, as quite irrespective c�Pra-
of European demands the adjacent Colonies of
Australia and New Zealand are increasing con-
sumers of cocoa-nut oil.
The long staple ? Sea Island ? Cotton of Fiji was Cotton,
awarded Gold medals at Philadelphia, in 1876, and
Paris, in 1878.
About 100 square miles of the island of Viti
Levu are adapted to the cultivation of tea and
Cinchona.
Tobacco grows well in Fiji, and is an industry Tobacco,
that would repay attention and development.
4. The group consists of about 255 islands, �j a ion and
having a total area of 7,400 square miles the 081 lon ?'
area of the two principal islands being respectively
4,112 and 2,432 square miles, with good navigable
rivers, and the remainder ranging from 217 square
miles downwards. Levuka, the capital, is at
present 60 days from London, via B>an Francisco
and Sydney, but as trade developes, the detour
via Sydney is certain to be abandoned for a more
direct route reducing the passage to 40 days from
London. Sydney is 1,800, Melbourne 2,000, and
New Zealand 1,2(J0 miles from Levuka, or 5 to 7
days distant by steamer.
5. About eighty of the islands are inhabited by Population,
a total population estimated at 120,000 natives,
and 2,000 whites.
6. The climate is delightful, the health of the Climate,
whites uniformly good, the ordinary diseases
common to the tropics, being unknown.
7. The soil is exceedingly fertile; many most Fertility,
valuable food, dye, medical and other plants and
fruits grow wild.
8. The gross exports, from the chief port of Export,.
Levuka (without counting the minor ports),


amounted in 1877 to �122,581, against �85,680
in 1875, or �95,909 of colonial produce, after de-
ducting articles imported and reshipped at that
port. The item of sugar alone rose from �3,245
in 1875 to �14,500 in 1877. The bulk of the
future trade of Fiji will be with Australia, New
Zealand, and the Pacific slope of America, which
can take all her tropical products. No rivals can
compete with Fiji in Australia and New Zealand.
9. Land, with a Government title, can be pur-
chased at from �1 per acre upwards, often with
river or sea frontage. Large blocks are in the
hands of people who cannot develop them for want
of capital. Only 16,000 or 20,000 acres out
of 855,000 held by foreign residents are at
present under cultivation. The entire acreage
of the islands is 4,738,350.
10. The Company will advance money to Land-
owners, Planters, and Manufacturers, to enable them
to erect mills and machinery, acquire land, and
develop the industries above mentioned, such
advances being secured upon the land, buildings,
and machinery, and will also advance upon Govern-
ment, Corporation, and Companies? Bonds and
Securities.
11. The Company will be prepared to act as
Agents for landowners, and others, in receiving
rents, negotiating and effecting sales of property,
realising consignments of produce in this country,
or through its Agents in the Colonies and elsewhere,
and otherwise in transacting general Agency busi-
ness for the Colony.
12. The Company will also receive money on
deposit at interest.
13. The demand for money is urgent. Colonial
bankers pay high rates of interest for deposits,

and money is dear in Australia where Fijian
planters endeavour to obtain loans. The large
profits derivable from the land and manufacture
and sale of produce enable the borrowers to offer
very remunerative rates of interest for advances.
14, The Company will not speculate in land or
other property, but will confine its operations to
advances on real or valuable securities, with a
margin of about 50 per cent., and to the Agency
business referred to.
15. From the undoubted character of the security
and the freedom from risk or speculation in the
nature of the business proposed to be conducted,
the Shareholders may safely reckon on highly
remunerative dividends. The following table
