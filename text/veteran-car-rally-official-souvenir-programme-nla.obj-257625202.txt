What the Run Is.
The Commemoration Run for Veteran Cars is held annually in
England to celebrate the anniversary of Emancipation Day, 1896.
On 14th November of that year forty-one of the leading motorists
of the day set forth on a run from London to Brighton, to cele-
brate the emancipation of the motorist from the shackles of the
two miles per hour speed limit and the doubtful honour of being
preceded at all times by a man with a red flag (see page 23).
The Sporting Car Club of Adelaide commenced about four
years ago, celebrating this event by a run from Adelaide to
Glenelg. They felt that these historic motor cars should be pre-
served from the scrap heap and the members have spent valuable
time and money in unearthing these relics of the birth of a
wonderful invention.
This year the Apex Club conceived the idea of putting this
very interesting Rally to an even more useful purpose than before.
They felt that it would be a splendid thing for the Adelaide
Children’s Hospital and the Crippled Children’s Association to
benefit from collections on the day of the Trial and the sale of
20,000 programmes.

APEX.
Apex had its beginning in the minds of three young men of Geelong
who felt the need in their community for an organization that would be
composed of young business and professional men who could attend regular
meetings, discuss their problems and be of some value to the community.
Every man has a certain individual dynamic force. While speaking as
a single person, his voice is lost in the rush of modern existence; but
with other young men harnessed to a single purpose the subsequent potenti-
alities seem to be without limit. This was the thought of Ewen Campbell
Laird, Langham Proud and John Buchan who, seeing that the time was
opportune, approached 20 young men similar to themselves, in order that
the idea might be discussed and developed.
So Apex was born, and through the kindness of Geelong Rotary Qub
the first meeting to discuss the formation of the Club was held in the Geelong
Rotary Room on 19th November, 1930.
March 10th, 1931 saw the drawing up of the Constitution and the adop-
tion of the name Apex meaning the height of ambition. After con-
siderable search for a suitable emblem the present triangular badge was
chosen, the base representing friendship, and the two sides fellowship and
service.
Five objects were embodied in the Constitution :
1. To make the ideal of Service the basis for all worthy enterprise.
2. To promote and participate in genuine good fellowship.
3. To encourage high ethical standards in business.
4. To foster the active interest of every member in the civic, commercial,
social and moral welfare of the community.
5. To effect the interchange of ideas and business methods as a means
of increasing the efficiency and usefulness of members.
Membership consists of men who have attained the age of 18, but not
attained the age of 35, and are of good character and business reputation,
engaged in any worthy recognised profession or business.
From Geelong the movement spread through Victoria and fourty-four
Clubs have since been established throughout Australia.
National service schemes raised funds to buy a truck for servicing inland
pedal wireless sets; partly establishing the Broken Hill wireless base for
Flying Doctor Service; providing equipment for various State organizations
performing mobile maternal and infant welfare work and so on.
Each Club is doing fine local service work too, and outstanding examples
such as Hobart’s raising £l,OOO in ome day for Crippled Children, and
Melbourne s running of the Collingwood Boys’ centre, indicate what can be
done by groups of young men with the object of service to the communitv
at heart.
The Adelaide Club which was formed in 1936 has a membership of 50
and is constantly contributing to the service work of this city. The Free
Kindergartens and the Crippled Children’s Association have been assisted-
also Christmas hampers have been distributed each year to needy families
and recently there have been regular movie entertainments at the hospitals
and homes for children. The big project in hand at the moment is the
establishing of a Boys' Centre in Halifax Street.
So with the spread of Apex throughout Australia will go this spirit of
National Service.

Fed-up Motorist (as navvies pre-
pare to take road up for the
umpteenth time): “Bah! Why don’t
you put zip fasteners on it?”—“The
North Wales Times.”
* ♦ *
A policeman was puzzled by the
behaviour of the very small car that
was approaching him along the road.
As it passed him he signalled to the
driver to stop. “Are you aware,
sir,” he asked, “that your car keeps
jumping into the air?”
“Yes,” said the driver, apologeti-
cally, “I’ve got the hiccoughs.”—
“Tit Bits” (London).
“I thought It was a mirage.”
—Everybody’s Weekly (London).
A man had been knocked down
by a motor car, and the policeman
was taking particulars. Among
those who had witnessed the acci-
dent was a certain learned profes-
sor, and the constable, turning to
him, said: “You say you saw the
accident, sir. What was the num-
ber of the car that knocked the
man down ? ”
“I’m afraid I’ve forgotten it,” re-
plied the professor, “but I remem-
ber noticing that if it were multi-
plied by itself the cube root of the
product would be equal to the sum
of the digits reversed.’

Now, when we cross the road,
my dear,” said the old lady to her
friend, “don’t look round, because if
a motor hits us in the back it’s their
fault, not ours!” “Manchester

Young McDougall: “Look, Father, Spares!”
The motorist had
just pulled into the
filling station for the
inevitable petrol.
That being over, the
attendant was going
through h i s little
ritual.
“Check the oil, sir?”
“No, thank’s, it’s
O.K.”
“Got enough water
in the radiator?”
. “Yes, filled up ”
“Anything else,
sir?”
“Yes, would you
please stick out your
tongue so I can seal
this letter?” — “The

1902
Pope-Tribune
H. E. McArthur
Driver—
H. E. McArthur
You will notice the skids on the rear
wheels. These were added by the
original owner after the car left the
factory. It still has two original
tyres. It will sometimes climb
Tapley’s Hill in bottom gear but spec-
tators are warned not to stand behind
the car while it is doing this in case
it runs backwards.
2
1902
Oldsmobile
E. W. Holden
Driver—
R. G. Pank
A 7 h.p. car which is steered (?) by a
tiller. After long practice the driver
can negotiate even the most narrow
street without hitting the kerb more
than twice every hundred yards.
Pedestrians are requested not to jostle
this car.
3
1902
Oldsmobile
A. O’Donnell
Driver—
A. O’Donnell
Another job steered by a tiller. Lady
passengers always wore veils tied
under their chins while in this car as
each gear change was accompanied by
a tremendous jerk which dislodged
their head gear. This car is old
enough to take care of itself and
strongly resents any attempt to drive
it. It was modernised at one time but
was later restored to its original first
class condition.
4
1904
Panhard
R. F. Williams
Although this has a four stroke motoi,
it has 3 cylinders. The Panhard was
one of the very earliest of French
makes and was the first car to have
a steering wheel, and was also the first
four cylinder. This manufacturer was
responsible for the so-called crash
gearbox which is still used. You
change gears on Friday and sort them
out over the week-end.
5
1904
De Dion
Bouton
P. Wien-Smith
Driver—
P. Wien-Smith
A very famous make which was t»ne of
the pioneers of the motor industry. It
was unearthed at the old Exhibition
Building on Frome Road. Somebody
discarded it for some reason. The
car is in its original condition as re-
gards paint work, upholstery and
coachwork, and has 1904 tools, Step-
ney wheel, etc.
6
1904
Buick
W. F. Cooper
Driver—
W. B. C. Rutt
Has the same overhead valves as in
the modern Buick. Otherwise it is- not
quite the same as the 1940 model.
Note the adjustable steering column.
7
1905
I.H.C. Motor
Buggy
L. E. Vinall
Driver —
L. E. Vinall
Has free-wheeling and the same valve
springs as are used on modern ve-
hicles. This early model was found
at Port Pirie where it was doing duty
as a fowl-roost in a thatched barn. It
is now never taken out without a
convoy.

It is Difficult or Impossible
to think of any other product that has improved so
much in so short a time as the modern car body.
When you look at the Veterans in the Rally and contrast the drivers’ pre-
carious perches with the luxurious comfort to which you are accustomed
to-day, it is worth remembering that Holden’s have kept in the very forefront
of progress. The modern Holden Unisteel Turret Top Body acknowledges
no superior. It is the safest and strongest ever made entirely of steel,
welded solidly to steel, reinforced with steel. The box-section steel pillars
give great strength in narrow diameter and allow a remarkably free field of
vision. Extremely efficient insulating and sound-deadening linings keep the
body cool in summer, warm in winter, and very quiet. This, the most beauti-
ful body on the road, is at the same time the safest and most comfortable.

THE MOTOR CAR - - - - By Mr. P. Wien-Smith.
If you were asked who built the first steam railway engine, the first
aeroplane or who invented wireless you would have little difficulty m giving
the correct answer.
But if the question was “Who Built the First Motor Car. how many
could answer that? And yet the birth and growth of the automobile is
one of the most fascinating subjects in which to delve. To-day * is almost
impossible to imagine life without this invention, although the real life eye e
of the motor car has only been about 40 years.
Of course, the idea of self-propelled vehicles existed long before the
twentieth century, in fact, the prophet Nahum wrote of them in the Bible.
Then Homer in his Iliad (1500 B.C.) mentioned the manufacture of some
kind of self-propelled machine, but it was not until 1200. B.C. that they
actually appeared on the streets. As for so many of our modern inventions
we have to thank the Chinese for the germ of the idea for it was m Peking
that the first reference occurs of the fore-runner of the present day motor
car For 2 500 years there seems to be a dearth of information concerning
automobiles until about 1250 A.D. when Roger Bacon wrote — That car-
riages, which without the aid of any animal will run with remarkable velocity.
Then in 1650, Verbiest, a Belgian monk in Peking, built a model of a steam-
car 2 feet long, driven by an aeolipyle which actually ran on a table. Cugnot,
a Frenchman, next built a steam wagon in 1769. It was a cumbersome affair,
which could be kept going for only 15 minutes at a speed of 2i miles per hour.
It is of exceptional interest, however, as it was the first engined vehicle to run.
The first internal combustion engine, the actual precursor of the motor
car, was built by Lenoir, a Belgian, living in France, in 1862. He used it
daily between his house and his works and the date at which he patented this
primitive contraption was 1860. He used illuminating gas as fuel and, the
most surprising thing of all, the car was fitted with electric ignition.
Herr Markus, in Germany, painstakingly manufactured a car in 1875 and
about the same time Ravel, a Frenchman, did likewise. Richard Butler (a
familiar name) in England built a large three-wheeled petrol-engmed vehicle
which was exhibited in 1883. A certain amount of doubt exists about the
claims of some of the earlier inventors but it has been definitely proved that
Delamere Debouteville manufactured a petrol-engmed car in trance in
and this seems to be the first automobile of this kind to be built. Germany
merits the most credit for the development of cars as at this period Daimler
and Benz, separately, built cars in 1885, and continued to experiment
many years with remarkable results. It was as late as 1925 that these manu-
facturers amalgamated and their product is now known the world over as
the Mercedes-Benz.
From 1890 onwards progress was most rapid, chief among the pioneers
being the Frenchmen, Panhard, Levaseur, Roger, De Dion, Bouton, Peugeot
and others In England, Talomans and Ellis did yeoman service in popular-
ising the car 1 and Lanchester in 1896 designed and built the-first satisfactory
car and in many respects this design was well ahead of the times. From this
time on, the progress made is more or less familiar to everyone.
Although I am always careful to point out that the Veteran Car Rally
held every year in South Australia is not a race, some figures regarding
motor racing might be found interesting.
Two miles a minute was first recorded by Stanley in a steam car of his
own make at Daytona in 1906. Then Malcolm Campbell was the first man
to travel at 150 m.p.h. in a Sunbeam on the sand at Pendive in 1925. In the
official list Campbell’s name appears no less than nine times and he retired
from car racing after reaching the stupendous speed of 301.13 m.p.h.
Another famous speedster, Segrave reached 203.79 m.p.h. dnvmg a Sun-
beam in 1927 and two years later raised this to 231.44. For this and other
racing achievements he was knighted. The record now rests with John
Cobb originally an Australian, and his Railton at 376 miles per hour.
This means that he covered a mile in just under ten seconds or our Veteran
Car route in about a minute and a half! ■
And at this almost unbelievable speed, the speed kings and I will stop

' “Yes, dear,” he replied.
