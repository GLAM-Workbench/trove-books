The Clerk read a report from the School Committee
stating that everything in the establishment was in good
order, and recommending that the boys belonging to
Shoreditch on board the training ship “ Goliath,” b 6
allowed to visit the schools for two or three days.
The Chairman, in moving the adoption of the report,
said it gave him great pleasure to state that although
the superintendent of the schools, Mr. Dening, was now
absent taking his holidays, the establishment was not
suffering in any way, owing to the admirable manner in
which Mr. Dening’s brother was acting as his locum
tenens. He seemed to do the work as if he bad been
used to it all his lifetime.
The report was adopted.
COMMON POOR EUND.
A letter was received from the Local Government
Board stating that the amount of the expenses repayable
out of the Common Poor Fund in respect to the expendi-
ture for the half-year ending Michaelmas, 1872, was
£12,057 Is. lid.; but the contribution of the Guardians
towards the fund, at the rate of 3|d. in the pound on
the rateable value of the property in the parish, was
£6,960 15s. 7d.; consequently there was a sum left of
£5,096 6s. 4d. to be repaid to the parish, which sum
would be handed to the Guardians’ treasurer probably
during the first week in October next.
Mr. Hodges remarked that notwithstanding the
large sums repayable annually from the Common Fund,
the cost to the parish for maintaining the poor was very
heavy. If, however,' his proposition of the previous
week were carried out, and Hackney districted with
Shoreditch, the expense would be divided between the
two parishes according to the rateable value of property
in each. (No, no.)
Mr. Deacon thought an equalisation of the poor-rate
throughout the metropolis would bring about the results
aimed at by Mr. Hodges’s proposition, but in a more
efficacious and less objectionable manner. (Hear, hear.)
A further letter was received from the Local Govern-
ment Board, intimating that the amount repayable to
this parish on account of boys on board the “ Goliath ”
training ship, for the half-year ended Michaelmas last,
was £47 13s. Bd. >C/ V / f
ASYLUM BOARD PRECEPT./ 0 C/-
A letter was received from the Metropolitan Asylums
District Board, stating that the amounts which will be
required from this parish for the half-year ending Lady-
day, 1874, are—on the maintenance account, payable in
December next, £1,750; common charges account, pay-
able on the Ist of March next, £696 Is. 6d.
The Clerk remarked that the amount demanded was
£l2O more than for the corresponding period of last year,
but thcro was now a larger number of imbeciles be-
longing to Shoreditch at Levesden than formerly. It was
stated in the local paper (jf the previous week, that the
effect of transferring 28 imbeciles from Northumberland
to Leavesden would be a saving of £6OO per annum.
This was simply ridiculous, because the cost of mainte-
nance at Leavesden was 10s. per week, against 14s. in
the Northumberland asylum; hence the saving would be
only 28 times 4s. multiplied by 52 weeks, or £391 4s.
per annum.
Mr. Deacon said it was quite true that such a state-
ment appeared in the local paper, but it was simply a
correct report of what was stated to the Board by the
Medical Officer, Dr. Forbes. (Hear, hear.)

TESTIM ON IA L TO INSPECTOR DENNING,
Under the genial and generous presidency of Sir Charles
Foster, M.P., ther* leak place yesterday, at the offices of
Mr. Rees, Parliamentary agent, Great George-street, ■West-
minster, a ceremony which was at once Interesting and
well merited. For a number of years Inspector Dannieg
has had the control of the police arrangements at the
Palace of Westminster, the Houses of Parliament, and the
Courts of Law Immediately adjoining. At all times his
duties are arduous and responsible, but they became
infinitely more bo during the protracted period of the
Tichborne trial. Mr, Denning, however, no matter where
the scene of his anxious labours lay, exhibited the
suaviter in modo as well as the fortiter in re ; and if he had
a disagreeable task to perform on any exceptional occa-
sion he did it with urbanity and the utmost filendlftiees of
manner. In a word, It may be said that with all among
whom he moved in Westminster circles be bocamo
justly popnlar. At the suggestion of some members of
the Legislature a movement, effectively carried out by
Mr. Rees, was aet on foot to present him with some suitable
testimonial in recognition of the esteem la which be is
held, and of the zeal that characterises the discharge of
his official duties. Among the subscribers are members of
the judicial bench, peers and commoners, clergymen,
banisters, and other professional and private gentlemen.
The testimonial itself took the form of, a magnificent watch
and chain, bearing Dent’s guarantee of excellence, and a
cheque for a substantial amount.
Sir 0. Foster, in handing the presentation, alluded to
the urbanity and uniform courtesy, but at tne same time
the unflinching firmness with which. Inspector Denning
carried out what he knew to be his duty. For a very
long period, in his capacity as an old House of
Commons member, he had almost daily opportunity
of observing bis conduct, and ho had always found him
most intelligent and obliging. Happily, this was not the
occasion of a valedictory tribute, for the recipient of their
gift was young, active, and vigorous, and he hoped that
h T 9 Wru’cl live many jxsnera im oons© in the eojojinant of
that esteem which be had so thoroughly earned.
Inspector Denning la suitable terms exi-r-esed his deep
sense of obligation to Sir Charles Foster for presiding and
bia gratitude to those who had been good enough to con-
sider him deserving of any testimonial. The honour was
one he had no right to look for, and he frankly admitted
that he did not consider he was entitled to any such
munificent recognition. However, the position he occupied
that day was one of which any man might well feel
proud, and he had the coßsclousneea that he never
would have occupied it but for the unwavering consider ati-m
and kindness of his superior officers, and for the able
assistance he had received from thd men who served under
bim. To those men he owed a lasting debt of gratitude,
and he was glad to have that opportunity of, on this sub-
ject, giving expression to his feelings. Again thanking all
who took part in the presentation, Inspector Denning con-
cluded by saying that he greatly prized the costly testi-
monial, and that it should be handed down as a heirloom
to his family.
The watch, a seif-winding chronometer, bore this inscrip-
tion, “ Presented to Inspector Denning, In recognition of
the zealous and obliging manner in which he has for
years discharged his duties at the Palace of Westminster,
at a meeting of subscribers to the Denning Testimonial
Fund, Sir Charles Foster, Bart., M.P., in the chair, on the
3rd February, 1875.”

Sale of a vessel to Pay the Wages of the
Ceew, —At tbs Borough Police Court, Cardiff, yesterday,
before Mr. R. O. Jones, a formal order was issued against
the captain of the Maltese vessel Sourano, for the payment
of wages duo to eight men constituting the crew. The
amounts claimed range from 122. to 352. The vessel, with
a cargo of over 400 tons of coal, had sailed Lom Cardiff for
the Black Sea, but in consequence of rough weather was
obliged to return to port, and the cost of repairs necessary
would have been about 1,5002, The owe era refused to
repair her, and therefore the captain discharged the crow,
and they brought a formal action against him. He will
not pay, and the ship will be sold in order they
may be paid. His own wages are recoverable In the

An event, to which very considerable personal interest was
attached, took place yesterday afternoon, at 12. Great George-
street, Westminster. Inspector Denning, whofor a number of
years has fulfilled the duties of chief police officer of the
House of Commons, was presented with a substantial
testimonial in recognition of the esteem in which he is

monial, which consisted of a che que and an elegant gold

Sir Charles Forster, Bart., M.P,, in the presence of
upwards of 50 of the subscribers, amongst whom were —
Lord Arundell of Wardour; Henry Allsopp, Esq., M.P.;
Messrs. Ashurst, Morris, and-Co. ; James Allport, Esq.;

Sir Charles Forster presented the testimonial in a lengthy
and complimentary speech, in the course of which he
referred in highly eulogistic terms to the uniform courtesy
and urbanity, and at the same time the firmness, with
which Inspector Denning had always performed his onerous
duties. He assured the recipient, in the names of the sub-
scribers, that although he had only done his duty, he had
done it in a manner that was sensibly appreciated by all
who knew him. His courtesy from the highest to the
lowest was unvarying, and he (Sir Charles) trusted that
Inspector Denning would “live many years to come
in the enjoyment of that esteem which he had so tho-
roughly earned. The hon. gentleman finally presented
Mr. Denning with the watch and cheque, observ-
ing that more subscriptions -were coming in, and
would in due course be handed over to him.—lnspector
Denning acknowledged the compliment that had been paid
him in an appropriate speech. He assured those present
that it was an honour that he ha'd no right to lock for,
because he did not feel limit elf entitled to it, nor, indeed,
should he ever have been placed in such a position
but for the able assistance which he had received
from those who served under him. He therefore
owed those men, whose conduct he could not too highly
praise, a lasting debt of gratitude, as he did also those
gentlemen who had subscribed to the testimonial, especially
Mr. Rees, who had suggested and promoted the movement.
Mi', Denning concluded an excellent reply by reiterating
his deep sense of gratitude, and assuring the subscribers
that he should hand clown the watch as a heirloom in his
family. —The watch, which bore a suitable inscription, was
then formally handed to Mr. Denning, who was cordially
congratulated by all present.

Denning acknowledged the compliment that had been paid
him in an appropriate speech, lie assured those present

because he did not feel himself entitled to it, nor, indeed’
should he ever have been placed in such a position
but for the able assistance which he had received
from those who served under him. He therefore
owed those men, whose conduct he could not too highly
praise, a lasting debt of gratitude, as he did also those
gentlemen who had subscribed to the testimonial, especially
Mr. Bees, whe had suggested and promoted the movement.
Mr. Denning concluded an excellent reply by reiterating
his deep sense of gratitude, and assuring the subscribers
that he should hand down the watch as a heirloom in his

congratulated by all present.


TESTIMONIAL TO INSPECTOR DENNING.
An event, to which very considerable personal interest Was
attached, took place yesterday afternoon; at 12, Great Georgo-
street, Westminster, Inspector Denning, who for a number of
years has fulfilled the duties of chief police officer of the
House of Commons, was presented with a substantial
testimonial in recognition of the esteem in which he is
held by members of parliament and others with whom he
has had to do during the period of his office. The testi-
monial, which consisted of a cheque and an elegant gold
watch and chain, was presented to the recipient by
Sir Charles Forster, Bart., M.P., in the presence of
upwards of 50 of the subscribers, amongst whom were—
Lord Arundel! of Ward our; Henry Allsopp, Esq., M.P.;
Messrs. Ashurst, Morris, and Co. ; James Allport, Esq.;
A. W. W. ; Bight Hon. Lord E. A. Bruce, C. 8., M.P. ;
Lieut. Colonel Beresford, M.P.; M. Biddulph, Esq., M.P.;
H. W. F. Bolckovv, Esq., M.P.; Major Fairfax Cartwright,
M.P. ; Eugene Collins, Esq., M.P.; Charles Costin, Esq.;
George Dixon, Esq., M.P.; Lieut. Colonel Dickson, L,S. ;
Henry Edwards, Esq., M.P. ; Boger Eykyn, Esq. ; 0.
Frere, Esq. ; Sir John Gray, M.P. ; J. E. Gorst, Esq.;
J. Fortescue Harrison, Esq., M.P. ; Mitchell Henry, Esq.,
M.P. ; Mr. J. Snowdon Henry; John Holms, Esq., M.P.;
H. J. C.; J. Foulston Hunt, Esq. ; Messrs. Hales and
Burgess; George Hopkins, Esq.; John Irwin, Esq.; Sir
Henry James, Q.C., M.P. ; Mr. Jones; Hon. Mr. Justice
Lush; Bev. Dr. Alfred T. Lee ; George I.eeman, Esq.;
F. E. Nicbclls, Esq. ; G. Norton, Esq. ; B. Barry O’Brien,
Esq.; S. Plimsoll, Esq., M.P; W. Powell, Esq., M.P. ;
D. W. Patteson, Esq. ; H. F. Purcell, Esq. ; Wollaston F.
Fym, Esq.; W. Bathbone, Esq,, M.P.; Bev. J. B.
Busssell; Bev. A. C. D. Byder; Captain Stacpoole, M.P.;
W. B. Simonds, Esq., M.P.; Alfred Seymour, Esq. ;
P. B. Sharkey, Esq.; and the Hon, Mrs. Wickham.
Sir Charles Forster presented the testimonial in a lengthy
and complimentary speech, in the course of which he
referred in highly eulogistic terms to the unifomi courtesy
and urbanity, and at the same time the firmness, with
which Inspector Denning had always performed his onerous
duties. He assured the recipient, in the names of the sub-
scribers, that although he had only done his duty, he had
done it in a manner that was sensibly appreciated by all
who knew him. His coui’tesy from the highest to the
lowest was unvarying, and he (Sir Charles) trusted that
Inspector Denning would dive many years to come
in the enjoyment of that esteem which he had so tho-
roughly earned. The hon, gentleman finally presented
Mr. Denning with the watch and cheque, observ-
ing that more subscriptions were coming in, and
would in due course be handed over to him.—lnspector
Denning acknowledged the compliment that had been paid
him in an appropriate speech, lie assured those present
that it was an honour that he hfCd no right to lock for,
because he did not feel himself entitled to it, nor, indeed,
should he ever have been placed in such a position
but for the able assistance which he had received
from those who served under him. tie therefore
owed those men, whose conduct he could not too highly
praise, a lasting debt of gratitude, as be did also those
gentlemen who had subscribed to the testimonial, especially
Mr. Bees, whe had suggested and promoted the movement.
Mr, Denning concluded an excellent reply by reiterating
his deep sense of gratitude, and assuring the subscribers
that he should hand down the watch as a heirloom in his
family. —The watch, which bore a suitable inscription, was
then formally handed to Mr. Denning, who was" cordially
congratulated by all present.

MR. WHALLEY AND THE TIOHBORNE CASE.
Mrl WHALLEY, who had a question oa the paper with
reference to this case, rose amid ironical cheers and
said —Sir, before putting the question I will ask L ave to
make a personal explanation—{“ order, order ”) —in
reference to what occurred on the last occasion wnen I
brought this subject before the House. On that occasion,
Sir, I may’have appeared to disregard your order, re-
peated as you said three times, to confine my remarks to
making intelligible my question, and was then justly
required to resume my seat for having disregarded your
orders. For any appearance of having done so I beg
leave to express my regret, and to state that I had no
intention whatever to do so. —(Hear, hear ) My excuse
is that I was speaking under this impression, no doubt
entirely wrong, that, havingmtimatedmy intention to con-
clude with a motion, I was in possession of the right of au-
dience beyond that of merely putting the question on
the paper ; and again, Sir, I beg leave to express my
entire acquiescence in your ruling.—(Cheers.) The hon
member then proceeded to put the question of which he
had given notice. He asked the Secretary to the Trea-
sury, with reference to the Tichhorne prosecution, whe-
ther it was a fact that Charles Orton received from the
Treasury during the progress of the trial a weekly pay-
ment of 205., such payment being made by Police-
inspector Denning, and the said Charles Orton being
dealt with for this purpose under the name of Webb;
and, as the said Charles Orton was not called as a wit-
ness on the part of the prosecution, what was the object
for whicb payment to him, if any, was so made; and
whether the honourable gentleman would now inform the
House of the total cost of that prosecution, and the
items of the expenditure, as had been done in other
ca«es.
Mr. W. H. SMITH. —I must remind the hon. gentle-
man and the House that he asked me this question, in
almost the same terms, on the sth of August, 1875, and
I then replied that, seeing the House had but a few
days before determined on a division that the information
which he ' sought should not be given him, I did
not consider it consistent with my duty to the
House or to the honourable member to answer
the question as he requested me. I think the division
which the House then came to is still binding on me, and
that I should not be consulting either the convenience or
the time of the House if I answered the question which
the hon. gentleman has now put to me. —(Hear, hear.)


MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS
MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS.
The appointment of Mr. Henry Hawkins, Q.C., to be a
Judge in the Queen’s Bench Division, as it is now styled,
of the High Court of Justice, was announced three weeks
ago. Mr. Hawkins has long enjoyed a popular reputation
as one of the most successful leading counsel who have
practised in the Courts at Westminster. He is, we be-
lieve, a native of Hitchin, and was at first articled to a
solicitor, but afterwards studied for the Bar, to which he
was called in 1843. He practised on the Home Circuit,
and soon proved his shrewdness in the cross-examination
of witnesses, and in putting a case before a jury. In
1858 he was appointed a Queen’s Counsel, and has of late
years been employed in many important cases before the
Superior Courts of Common Law. In the second Tich-
borne trial, it will be remembered, Mr. Hawkins bore a
leading part, as counsel for the prosecution of the famous
“Claimant” for perjury. He has also been a candi-
date for Parliamentary honours, contesting the seat for
Barnstaple at the general election of 1865, but did not
get elected.
The portrait of Mr. Justice Hawkins is from a photo-
graph by Messrs. Maull and Co., of Regent-street and

Tipstaffs cannot, however, be where the judicature
Act operates, and yesterday, when Mr Hunt was
sentenced to two months at Holloway, it might have
been two months before he got there, if inspector
Denning had’nt been at hand. Mr Denning may do
wrong things sometimes, but he is the last man you
would suspect of doing them. Mr Hunt is only mortal
and in the innocence of bis heart let Mr Denning do
that which he had no more right to do than you or I
had. The Judicature Acts have, however, produced
sad confusion at Westminister, and yesterday’s in-
cident is an instance of another good judge having
gpne wrong.
George Odger’s death seems not only to have been
followed by a great amount of eulogy, but by the
saying of thilgs which might well have been satfTSe-
fore. The lat£ working man representative is now to
be remembered tw*, aa the demagogue which the
world thought him, but as atemperate and thought-
ful. advocate of conciliation among classes and in-
terests. If a testimonial is to be got up for him in
this character it ought to receive a wide response.
The committee appointed in September last to look
after the poo* fellows temporal concerns collected
nearly two pounds most of which sum has
been spent. What is left, and what is promised, will

hour before the trial commenced on Monday morning—
id est, ten o’clock, I could obtain an entry into this court
of justice. I therefore attended at the Sessions House
this morning at 9.30, deeming that to be sufficiently
early; when I was informed that I could not be admitted,
although the court was not then full, until the trial com-
menced. This I thought to be fair, and in the interim had
the satisfaction of seeing several people admitted by showing
a ticket, whilst the general public were excluded. This is an
open court. No sooner had the last person connected with
the trial entered the building than there was a rush to the
doors. Some dozen people managed to squeeze in, and then
the doors were < closed; shortly afterwards the inspector
appeared, and said that there was not one spot unoccupied in
the court; the police then commenced poshing the people
down the steps. Notwithstanding the assertion of the in-
spector, more persons were admitted by the inevitable ticket.
1 should like to know whether or not this is an open court. —
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

THE TICHBORNE CASE.—MR. SKIPWORTH AND THE
, “ CLAIMANT.”
The Court of Queen’s Bench having ordered Mr. G. D. Skip worth, ot
Caistor, near Lincoln, barrister-at-law, and Thomas Castro, otherwise Arthur
Orton, the Claimant, to attend at the sitting of the court this morning to
answer for contempt of court, there was a crowd in Westminster Hall. At
an early hour a body of the A division of police, under Superintendent
Denning, took charge of the different entrances, and by their admirable conduct
all confusion was prevented. The court itself was completely filled long before
ten o’clock, the usual hour for commencing business. The bar mustered in such
great force that the non-professional portion of the spectators, including many
ladies, could only find accommodation in the galleries or in the extreme rear of
the court.


PREPARATIONS TO SEND MR. SKIPWORTH TO PRISON.
Mr. Skipworth, at the conclusion, of the sentence, was
taken charge of by Mr. Frailing, jun., the officer of the
Court, and was conducted to the Exchequer Chamber,
where he disrobed, and was detained while the formality
of drawing up the committal was being gone through.
That done he left the chamber, and, accompanied by his
solicitor and by Inspector Denning and Mr. Frailing, pro-
ceeded to a cab which was drawn up in waiting for him at
the entrance to the hall, and was driven off on his way to
Holloway Prison. There were many persons present, but
there was no demonstration, and he departed to his
“prison house,” taking with him the sympathy of many
friends, groups of whom lingered in Palace-yard some time
after his departure, conversing on the subject,

tures who come like shadows, linger
but for a moment before the eye, and then
drop off towards the wings without the
possibility of a recall. In the dynamite
drama, men like O’Donovan Rossaand his
murdering tools seem to usurp the whole
stage, and no doubt they have a large,
shadowy appearance. They produce an
effect similar to that created by Satan in
the “ Vision of Judgment”
•‘And where he gazed, a gloom pervaded
, space.”
But, necessarily, like Satan, the dynamite
fiends have only their turn. Having made
their little explosion, they pass, and give
place to those whom their noises have dis-
turbed. These, also, are important
a enough. There is, for instance, the
Speaker, who, being the First Commoner
in England, casts a rather extended
t shadow upon the stage, though not of the
3 Satanic order. He makes new rules for
| the admission of strangers to the House
of Commons, adding one or two with re-

Gauls. Aubrey’s story of the wrens
in connection with the battle of Glinsaly
in Donegal is also well known. The Pro-
testauts would have been surprised and
cut to pieces, had not a flock of these
little birds warned the guards by making
a noise in hopping over and pecking
at the drums. For the time, in fact,
the wrens made themselves drummers
in the service of the Protestant cause.
The truth is you cannot be too careful of
or too kind to the birds. With few ex-
ceptions, they are of the utmost value to
man; and it is rather curious to find the
peaceful dove to some extent affected
by the political questions of the
day, or, as might be said, a figure
in the destinies of the British Empire.
