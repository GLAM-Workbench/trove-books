Ordered by the Legislative Assembly to be Printed, 7 April, 1859.
A. C. Gregory ; Esq. ; to The Secretary for Lands and Public Works.
Sydney, 13 December, 1858.
Sir,
I have the honor to transmit maps of the route of the late expedition in search
of traces of Dr. Leichhardt and party.
In the construction of these maps the latitudes of sixty-six stations at nearly equal
intervals on the line of route have been carefully observed, and thus the latitudes may be
confidently relied on. The longitudes have been deduced from compass bearings between the
parallels of latitude observed, —the variation of the needle being corrected by frequent
amplitudes.
The meteorological observations during the expedition are embodied in the accom-
panying register of the temperature, &c., omitting the barometric pressure, as the varying
heights of the stations of observation render them of no value, besides the determination of
elevations by comparison with the recorded readings of the barometer at stations, the eleva-
tions of which are known as at Adelaide, Melbourne, Parramatta, and Cape Moreton, and
having prepared a diagram of these observations for this purpose, I append it to this register.
Not having yet received the necessary barometrical data from Adelaide for the months
of May and June, the diagram section shewing the altitudes of the country on the route of
the expedition cannot yet be completed, but will be transmitted at the earliest possible date.
The botanical specimens collected by the expedition having been arranged, and a list
prepared by Dr. Mueller, the Government Botanist of Victoria, I transmit the same, —the
specimens having been labelled and transferred to the Director of the Botanic Gardens.
The few geological specimens collected have been deposited in the Sydney Museum.
I have, &c,,
The Honorable A. C. GREG OB Y.

The observed readings of the barometer are omitted, as the varying heights of the
stations of observation render them only useful for the determination of differences of eleva-
tion, and the results are embodied in the diagram section accompanying the maps.
The attached diagram of the comparative variations of the barometer at Adelaide,
Melbourne, Parramatta, and Cape Moreton, has been compiled from the official Meteorological
Registers kept at the respective places.
The observed temperature at sunrise is invariably the minimum temperature for

CRUOIFERAS.
/ Blennodia canescens. R. Br. in Sturt’s Central Australia, vol. 11. App. p. 07.
The specimens collected by Mr. Gregory constitute a variety with broaditoothed leaves.
j - Blennodia lasiocarpa. Ferd. Mueller in Transact. Phil. Soc. Viet., vol. I. p. 100.
Like the preceding species, an annual herb.
CAPPARIDEiE.
y Capparis sp.
A climbing, thorny, velvety species, with small oblong leaves; in absence of flowers
and fruit not specifically to be defined. Besides Capparis Mitchelli no other plant of this
order is hitherto found within the boundaries of the Colony of South Australia, whilst in
Australia Felix, Tasmania, New Zealand, and at least the southern portion of Western
Australia, Capparidece are entirely wanting. The species are extremely variable, and their
characteristics, as hitherto given, must in many instances be remodelled.
YIOLARINiE.
JONIDIUM SP.
UM SP.
The only Australian species with orange flowers; it occurs also throughout the greater
part of tropical and eastern sub-tropical Australia.
SAPINDACEiE.
J ' Apophyllum anomalum. Ferd. Mueller in Hooker’s Kew Miscell., 1857, p. 307.
Mr. Gregory’s specimens are destitute both of flowers and fruits, but seem identical
with those of the Brigalow Scrub of East Australia,
ZYGOPHYLLEiE.
£ Zygophyllum Billardierii. B. C. Prodr., I. 705.
A variety with oblongs linear leaves, and remarkably minute flowers,. Without a full
series of intermediate forms, which I accumulated in various parts of Southern Australia,
< ft would be impossible to identify the desert plant with the broad-leaved, large-flowering
typical state of Jliis species which ornaments occasionally our sandy and rocky shores. No
Zygophyllecz ha* hitherto been found in Australia within the tropic.
PHYTOLACCEiE.
y Gyrostemon PUNGENS. Lindl. in Mitch. Three Exped., 11. 121.
This rare plant has been found previously only, and very sparingly, towards the junction
of the Murray and Darling Rivers, and on the western base of Flinders’ Range. The male
flowers are unknown.
MALYAOEiE,
Sida tubulosa. All. Cunn. ex llooJc. in Mitch. Trop. Australia, 390.
This Sida extends, like the following, from Flinders’ Range to the eastern tropical
interior, and assumes many different forms, which might easily be taken for distinct species.
Sida diplotricha Ferd. Mueller in Linnaea, XXV. 380.
Malya

Throughout the whole of tropical and sub-tropical Australia, as far as 31° S. Possibly
to be combined with the American Malva spicata, L., since it forms many varieties in leaves
indument and number of carpels.
Hibiscus Trionum. L. sp.pl., 981.
The locality from whence Mr. Gregory obtained his specimens, —“ bed of dry lagoons on
Cooper’s Creek” —seem to be inland the southernmost of this species in Australia. Three
other Hibisci, including the West Australian Hibiscus (Fugosia ) hakecefolin, occur on
Spencer’s Gulf and Lake Torrens ; none however reaches apparently the latitudes of the
Colony of Victoria.

the smooth 5-cleft corolla. A shrub-Mr, Gregory found on stony placeman allied and perhaps
undescribed species, forming a tall tree, with curly bark, dark wood, and leaves sometimes
fully 10 ; but of this, and of another arborescent Acacia, no pods were obtainable, without
which the species of this large genus cannot be clearly distinguished.

Erect; branches terete, without furrows, as well as the flowerstalks thinly grey,-,
tomentose and slightly silky; leaves on long petiols, with one, rarely with three leaflets;
lateral leaflets extremely small; terminal one oblong, slightly silky tomentose, whitish
grey, without dots; small, or obliterated; racemes terminal, with many
somewhat remote yellow flowers; pedicels hardly as long as the calyx, but much longer than
the linear-lanceolate bracts; bracteols very small, lanceolate subulate; teeth of the
5-cleft, silky calyx deltoid,-lanceolate, almost equal; vexillunv three times longer than

the calyx, but slightly surpassing the length of the keel and wings, heartshaped, nearly
glabrous, with callous base; keel below as well as the unguis of the vexillum densely
ciliated; above the middle in front fringed,’germen sessile, oblong, silky.
On Cooper’s River.— A. C. Gregory.
Seemingly a shrubby species.
Leafstalks f-1 long;grey; terminal leaflets long; 2-4" broad, lateral ones
onlyf 1-1 long, often absent; calyx,Jiardly longer than 2"; long; wings,
ovate; carina*_gradually pointed; lt differs from C. Mitchdlii, in its
indument, longer leafstalks, narrower leaflets, smaller stipules, longer flowers, &c., from C.
Slurtii, in the form of the leaflets, three times smaller flowers, cordate vexillum ; from C.
reiusa, in its tomentum, hardly angular branches, neither dotted leaflets nor sessile leaves,
and from C. dissitiflora, to which it approaches nearest, in its imperfect silk, obliterated
lateral leaflets, larger flowers, and perhaps also in its fruit. The occasional development of
small lateral leaflets in this remarkable plant, together with the articulation of the petiole,
prove sufficiently that the simple leaves in Crotolaria are to be regarded as compound ones
reduced to a solitary leaflet. In all the Australian species, amounting to 14, and in those
from China, both Indies, and South Africa, which I examined, I observed dimorphous
anthers, which seem to offer an essential characteristic of the genus.

Indigofera lasiantha. Ferd. Mueller.
Shrubby, grey silky^tomentose; branches, terete without farrows; leaves, with
generally 4-5, rarer 2-3 pairs of
recurved; racemes spicate, densely many flowered, somewhat longer than the
leaves; bracts linear-lanceolate; teeth of the 5-cleft calyx lanceolate-subulate; vexillum
outward velvety, nearly three times longer than the calyx; germen cylindrical, densely
velutinous, with several ovules.
On Cooper’s River.-*-A. C. Gregory.
Leaflets mostly 2£-4" long; their raches thin, measuring about 1"; stipules 1-2"'
long; racemes on short peduncles; pedicels at least 1" long; calyx long, its superior teeth
shortest, lowermost the longest; Corolla probably pink, standard cordate, nearly 3'" long,
wings oblong,-spathulate, glabrous, of equal length with the standard and keel; carina
outside silky/pod not seen.
As regards the leaves, this species approaches nearly to the Indian
(found also in North Australia), but in other respects it differs widely ’JJfacanthocarpa found
in Sir T. Mitchell’s first Exped., is identical with Clidantherapsoralioides.
SwAINSONA CAMPYLANTHA. Ferd. Mueller.
Glabrous stems, long, flaccid; leaflets in 1-3 pairs; stipuls small, lanceolate subulate;
leaflets long, lanceolate^linear, acute, subsessile; flowered, on a long angular
peduncle; bracts cymbiform considerably shorter than the pedicel, as well the calyxes ciliate;
teeth of the calyx deltoid, long r acuminate; corolla purple; vexillum bicallous, wings twisted
near the auriculate kase, callous; style silky,
its stork longer than the calix.
On the Plains along Cooper’s River.— A. C. Gregory.
Leaflets distant, generally long, 1-2 7 broad; peduncles triangular, or rarer
quadrangular ; pedicKs about long ; calyx 2" long at the base, with 2 very small linear
bracteoles; vexillum B\broad ; round-kidney-shaped, longer than the wings, with a short

corolla blue or purple, 8-15" long; stamens deeply enclosed, filaments slightly downy,
anthers a little longer than V" with emarginate base; style somewhat hairy, upwards
glabrous; capsule 'long, imperfectly two-celled. To be distinguished from D. bracteatus
( Rucllia bi acteata, R. Br. Endl. iconogr. to 104) by smaller leaves and flowers, a corolla
neither glabrous nor forming a long slender tube above the calyx, persistent bracts, blunt
deeper-enclosed anthers, and not equal lobes of the stigma.
Dipteracanthus Pumilio, Nees in D. C. Prodrom., XI. p. 124, appears to me a mere
variety of Ruellia Australis, R. Br.
Since Acanthaceous plants are principally developed in tropical countries, their absence
from Australia Felix, New Zealand, Tasmania, and South-west Australia cannot be surprising.
But it remains a singular fact in the geography of plants, that in the northern, and particu-
larly in the north-eastern part of Australia, where a warm humid atmosphere prevails, so
very few plants of this order should have been discovered compared with the richdom of
species which ornament the tropical countries of Asia and America.
All the Australian Acanthaceae hitherto known amount to only 17 species, belonging
to the following genera :—Staurogyne, Adenosma, Ruellia, Dipteracanthus, Eranthemum,
Rostellaria, Adhatoda, Hygrrphila, Dicliptera, Brochosiphqn, Hypoestes, Nelsonia, and
Dilwaria. Both of Ruellia and Rostellaria it seems Australia possesses but a single
species. Ruellia acaulis is a remarkable variety with elongate peduncles bracteate at the

I should have hesitated to combine all the above plants under one specific name, had
I not for many seasons and in the most distant parts of the country, examined and watched
what I consider the only Australian species of this genus, to which in all probability also the
Indian Pappophorum elegans belongs. I failed entirely to discover any reliable specific
distinction between the numerous forms, and feel fully convinced that characters derived
from color and indument are of as little absolute value for the distinction of grasses, than of
other orders of plants. No class of plants requires more a careful renewed disquisition than
grasses, none of our best agrostographs having had the advantage of studying the extraordi-
nary varieties which many of the species produce, by travels through tropical countries.
