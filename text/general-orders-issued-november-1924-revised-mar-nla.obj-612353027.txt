PAST 2.
Correspondence Prior to Lodgment of an Application.
20 (1) Where correspondence is received from a prospective
applicant, or from a person who is apparently an eligible person
such will he recorded in the “ Gr ” register and a Form 2 and 1 orm 4
m O’s 21 and 24) opened, and the former completed with G number
and filed accordingly. The Form 4 will he placed in a special division
of the card cabinet. .
(2) When an application is received in a case recorded as m. (1)
a J number will be allotted to the Forms 2 and 4 the G register
noted as to the transfer, and the Form 4 placed in its alphabetical order
in the ordinary division of the card cabinet.
(3) The J number having been allotted from the Register of
Applications Received (Form 3) the entry will he completed as m G.O.
Applications—Method of Recording.
21. (1) On receipt of an application (Form 1) a jacket (Form 2)
will he opened and passed to the officer whose duty it is to keep the
Register of Applications Received.
(2) Upon receipt of the jacket the officer keeping the Register of
Applications Received (Form 3) will enter particulars of the applica-
tion in the Register against the next consecutive J number. lhe
registration number will then he placed on the jacket in the space pro-
vided, and the following additional particulars included m the jacket
in the appropriate spaces: —
(a) The applicant’s Christian names and surname.
(b) Address.
(c) Class of assistance (subsequent changes to he noted).
(3) The location of a jacket from time to time will he recorded m
a simple location register.
Register of Applications Received.
22. (1) Upon receipt of an application it will he entered in the
Register of Applications Received (Form 3) against the first J number.
Subsequent applications will be entered and allotted J numbers m
consecutive order. After allotment of the proper J numbei such wu
be endorsed on the jacket and the movement of the file recoided m the
location register.
(2) Where an application is renewed, either under the original or
any other class of assistance, such will he regarded as an additional
application whether the completion of a fresh application form is
necessary or not, the original J number will be retained and
the new proposal re-entered by inserting the J number as an
interlineation as provided on the line between the last J numbei
allotted and the next vacant one, the remaining particulars being entered
in the proper columns. Against the J number originally entered
will be noted the number of the page where any subsequent entries are
made. All such entries will be in red ink.
(3) The Register will be ruled off at the close of each month and
the number of applications received arrived at by totalling the column
under each class of assistance.


Register of Applications Dealt With.
23. (1) When a decision regarding an application is given the
fact will he entered in the appropriate column in the Register of Ap-
plications Dealt With (Form 15), and at the same time the consecutive
number will be set against the J number in the Register of Applications
Received.
(2) Where a decision is varied, such as the refusal or withdrawal
of an application after it has been approved, &c., no entry is required
in the Register of Applications Received, but a credit entry will be
made in the Register of Applications Dealt With by inserting the
J number of the case against the next unallotted consecutive
number, showing the original consecutive number in the variation
column and making an entry (which, with the preceding ones, will be
in red ink) in the proper column under “Approved,” “ Refused,” or
“ Withdrawn,” according to which credit is to be given because of the
change in the decision. At the same time an entry in black ink will
be made in the appropriate column to record the nature of the variation.
For instance, if an application was originally “To Buy ” and was
approved, and was later on withdrawn, a red ink entry would be made
in the “ To Buy ” column in the “ Approved ” section and a black
ink entry in the “ To Buy ” column in the “ Withdrawn ” section.
To complete the transaction, in the “Variation” column against the
original entry will be inserted, in red, the new consecutive number
allotted.
(3) To arrive at the number of pending applications at any time
all that is necessary is to rule off the Register of Applications Dealt
With, total the columns under each heading, and the sum of the totals
of each class of assistance in the three sections (“Approved,”
“Refused” and “Withdrawn”) deducted from the total applications
for a similar class of assistance in the Register of Applications Re-
ceived will give the number of applications pending in that class of
assistance. The.result arrived at must necessarily agree with the
number of J numbers against which a consecutive number has not
been placed.
Applicant’s Personal Card.
24. (1) An applicant’s personal card (Form 4) will be opened in
respect of each application received and the J number recorded in
the first column, but subsequent applications from the same person
will also be entered on the Form 4. Correspondence from, to or on
behalf of an applicant, will be placed on the J file in order of
receipt, and will not be registered unless in the case of important docu-
ments where registration is considered advisable.
(2) After the relative particulars of an application have been
entered in the Register of Applications Received and the applicant’s
personal card has been opened, the jacket will be passed to the Senior
Clerk for necessary action.
Priority of Applications.
25. (1) All applications will be dealt with strictly in order of date
of lodgment of the application. Order of priority shall be reckoned
from the date of the first application lodged, except in special circum-
stances such as the case of an applicant whose application was with-
drawn owing to non-reply to correspondence, and in respect of which


a satisfactory explanation cannot be furnished. In such cases the order
of priority shall be reckoned from the date of lodgment of the applica-
tion then under consideration.
(2) Where an application is held up owing to title difficulties, &c.,
the application next in priority is to be advanced until such time as
the first application is in order. The latter will then be proceeded
with.
Investigation of Eligibility.
26. (1) The Senior Clerk will be responsible for action
being taken in regard to the investigation of the eligibility of an appli-
cant.
(2) The action to be taken to establish the eligibility of an appli-
cant will cover —
(a) In the case of a person who was a member of the Naval or
Military Forces of Australia, the inspection ot
the Certificate of Discharge or Statement of Service, or
comparison with the records of the Defence Department
to prove that the applicant concerned is an Australian
soldier within the meaning of Section 4 of the War
Service Homes Act 1918-1927.
(b) In the case of a person who served in the Naval or Military
Forces of any part of the King’s Dominions, other than
the Commonwealth, such action as the Deputy Commis-
sioner may consider necessary to prove to his satisfaction
that the person applying for assistance served during the
war which commenced in 1914 in the Naval or Military
Forces of any part of the King’s Dominions, other than
the Commonwealth, and that he had resided in Australia
prior to his enlistment or appointment for service.
(c) In the case of —
i A Munition Worker;
ii A War Worker;
iii A member of the Y.M.C.A. who was accepted foi
service with and served abroad with the Naval
or Military Forces of Australia as a representa-
tive of that Association; or
iv A person who has been awarded in respect of his
employment during the war which commenced
in 1914 the Australian Mercantile Marine War
Zone Badge or the British Mercantile Marine
Medal; and who was during such employment
domiciled in Australia;
a search of the records of the Defence Department or
Navy Department, as the case may be, to ascertain whe-
ther or not the applicant is one of the persons mentioned
in Section 4 of the War Service Homes Act 1918-1927,
and such other inquiry as the case suggests should be in-
stituted to determine the eligibility of the person apply-
ing for assistance.


(d) In the case of a Female Dependant of an Australian Soldier,
Munition Worker, War Worker, member of the Y.M.C.A.,
recipient of the A.M.M.W.Z.B. or in-
vestigation to confirm the service of the person upon
whom the applicant was dependent, and in the case of the
widow the Marriage Certificate should be sighted or a
statutory declaration required as to the fact of the mar-
riage.
(e) In the case of a Widowed Mother, enquiry to confirm her
dependence upon the person specified in the application
prior to that person’s appointment, enlistment, accept-
ance, or employment, as the case may be, is not required
unless the particulars available render such a course
necessary.
(/) In the case of a Mother, whose husband is so incapacitated
as to be unable to contribute materially to her support,
enquiry to ascertain that the facts of the case are as
stated.
.(3) In all cases of interstate applicants, i.e., applicants who either
enlisted or were discharged in a State other than that in which applica-
tion is being made, Inquiry should be made of the Deputy Commissioner
or other representative of the Commission to ascertain if assistance has
previously been granted in the State of enlistment or discharge. If,
after inquiry, a reply in the negative is received from the State of
enlistment or discharge, as the case may be, and the application lodged
m the State from which the inquiry emanated is approved, the Deputy
Commissioner or other representative of the Commission, in the State
of enlistment or discharge, is to be immediately advised of such
approval.
(4) _ In any case where any doubt exists inquiry should be made to
ascertain if an applicant has been previously assisted by the Lands
Department under the Returned Soldiers’ Land Settlement Scheme, or
if assistance of a similar nature has been granted by any other Govern-
ment Department.
(5) Where an applicant has previously obtained assistance under
the Returned Soldiers Land Settlement Scheme, his eligibilitv for
assistance under the War Service Homes Act can only be approved
provided that—
(a) A certificate is produced from a Medical Officer of the
Repatriation Commission stating that the condition of
the applicant’s health is due to war service, and is such
that he is not able physically to carry on as a land
settler; and
(b) A certificate is furnished by the Lands Department of the
State in which assistance was granted stating that the
applicant has fully discharged his liability in respect to
the assistance granted him under the Returned Soldiers’
Land Settlement Scheme; and
(c) The applicant fully satisfies the provisions of Section 28 of
the Act.


(6) Where an applicant, who has received assistance under the
Act, is desirous of obtaining assistance from the proper body to engage
in agricultural pursuits, he should he informed that he must obtain
(b) A certificate of clearance from the Deputy Commissionei
Commission stating that the condition of his health is due
to war service and is such that he should secure out-door
occupation away from the city; and
(b) A certificate of clearance from the Deputy Commissioner
for the State in which assistance was granted that he has
fully discharged his liability to the Commission; and that
(c) Compliance with (a) and (&) does not in any way suggest
that his land application will be successful, the decision
regarding which being within the discretion of the respon-
sible body.
(7) Where an application is received from a person previously
assisted under the Returned Soldiers’ Land Settlement Scheme, who is
unable to comply with the provisions of (5) and (6), full particulars
of the case shall be referred to C.A. for presentation to the. Minister
for decision as to the admittance of the .application or otherwise.
(8) In submitting such cases the following information should be
furnished: —
(a) Where the ex-land settler was settled on the land, the amount
of loan and his present liability in respect of the land;
(b) The reasons for the land settler leaving his block, together
with information from the Lands Department;
(c) The date the applicant left his holding, the nature of his,
employment subsequently, and also the town of emp 03 -
ment;
(d) Was the holding successfully worked after being relin-
quished by the applicant;
(e) Class of eligible person, together with particulars regarding
applicant’s family, if any;
(/) The amount of deposit proposed to be lodged, applicant’s
employment, and rate of wage.
Definition of Ship of War.
27. (1) The definition of a Ship of War, referred to in para-
graph (a) of the definition of Australian Soldier in Section 4 of
the Act, is a Government vessel constructed and armed for the purpose
of attack, or a vessel which, if not originally so constructed, has been
adapted for or converted to that purpose.
(2) Those who served on troopships are therefore, ineligible for
assistance under the Act, unless such persons come within the scope of
paragraph (e) of the definition of eligible person m Section 4 of
the Act.
Eligibility of Stepmothers, Fostermothers, and De Facto Widows.
28. (1) Stepmothers, fostermothers, and de facto widows are
ineligible for assistance under the Act.


(2) De facto wives, fostermothers, and adopted and ex-nuptial
children may be dependants of eligible persons applying for assistance
under the Act, on whose behalf the claim is made that it is necessary
to provide a home.
Eligibility of Minors.
29. (1) The Act does not debar minors from obtaining assistance,
and providing, the applicant comes within Section 4 the minority will
not in itself influence the application, which should be dealt with as
provided in the G.O.’s.
(2) A minor may execute any document necessary to secure any
assistance which may be granted.
Eligibility of Nurses.
30. (1) A nurse who served in the Forces particularized in Section
4 of the Act is defined as an “ Australian Soldier ”, and, providing she
is married, is about to marry, or has dependants for whom it is necessary
to provide a home, she may submit an application. If she is a widow
the foregoing conditions will still apply.
(2) In addition a nurse as such is eligible to receive assistance in
respect of a hospital, &c. (Sections 19 and 20).
Widows of Eligible Persons.
31. (1) The remarriage of a widow of an eligible person imme-
diately renders her ineligible for assistance, as she cannot then be
brought within the category of “ Female Dependant ”, as defined in
Section 4 of the Act.
(2) If such a person marries an eligible person he may be granted
assistance, providing his application is satisfactory, as an eligible person
who is married, provided he or his wife does not own a dwelling-house.
If she marries a civilian she would be ineligible, as would be the case if
the civilian husband died.
Remarriage of a Widow.
32. (1) Upon the remarriage of a widow who has been actually
granted assistance, and whether or not the security documents have
been completed, her eligibility will not be affected by this act on her
part.
(2) Where the application has been received and assistance has not
been granted, the act of remarriage will render the applicant ineligible
for assistance.
(3) If, as in the case of clause (1) the security documents have not
been executed, then such are to be completed in the name of the appli-
cant prior to her remarriage, but if the remarriage is with an eligible
person then the security documents should be completed in the name
of the widow or her husband at the choice of the applicant. If, after
marriage to an eligible person, the applicant desires to transfer her
interest to her husband, then such may be effected by obtaining an
application from the husband, a release from the female applicant, and
the necessary security documents completed.


Eligibility of Deserters.
33. (1) Members of the Forces who have been found guilty of
desertion prior to the signing of the Armistice, those who have been
charged with other offences and sentenced to imprisonment for twelve
months or over, and those who have been dismissed from the service
are not to be granted assistance. Cases with special circumstances are
to be submitted to C.A. for consideration.
(2) A list of ex-members of the Australian Imperial Forces
referred to in this G.O. is retained at each branch of the Repatriation
Department.
Uncertificated Insolvents.
34. (1) An uncertificated insolvent cannot be determined a suitable
person under Section 28 to whom assistance may be made available,
and consequently applications from such persons should be declined if
it is known that the person applying is an uncertificated insolvent.
(2) The question then arises as to whether assistance should be
granted to an applicant who has received his certificate, and in regard
to this it should not be overlooked that a certificate may be absolute or
conditional upon the insolvent paying certain moneys to his assignee.
If a certificate is absolute the case would be dealt with in the ordinary
way, but where the certificate is conditional then the conditions should
be scrutinized, for if the applicant is obliged to pay moneys to the
assignee out of his earnings, such payments must be taken into account
in determining whether he has a reasonable prospect of meeting the
terms of the proposed contract as mentioned in Section 28 of the Act.
Ownership of a Dwelling-house. —(Sections 19A and 23).
35. (1) It should be noted that in connexion with Sections 19A and
23, ownership includes the applicant, his wife, or intended wife or
husband, who holds land and a dwelling-house in tenure, fee-simple
or otherwise.
(2) Where a person has acquired a part interest in the dwelling-
house in conjunction with his wife, fiancee and/or dependant or
dependants for whom such person claims it is necessary for him to
provide a home, and the ownership of the dwelling-house is vested in
those persons, then the applicant is ineligible for assistance under the
Act, and the definition of owner as regards such a dwelling-house,
together with the land on which it is erected, shall be read and con-
strued to include such a person.
(3) In the case of a person —-
(a) who has acquired a part interest in a dwelling-house in
conjunction with one or more persons other than those
mentioned in the previous paragraph; or
(b) who has been devised or whose wife, fiancee and/or
dependant or dependants have been devised a whole or
part interest in a dwelling-house;
the eligibility will be decided by C.A.
(4) An applicant who is the registered proprietor of a dwelling-
house and land and who has sold such on terms under a contract of
sale may be granted assistance. It is pointed out that, whilst the


applicant is the registered proprietor, his purchaser is the equitable
owner of the dwelling-house and land and is entitled to its use and
occupation.
(5) Where the dwelling-house owned is situated out of the Com-
monwealth, or remotely situated within the Commonwealth, or does not
represent a suitable home, the whole of the facts should he submitted
to C.A. for consideration.
Service in Forces Raised by Allies.
36. Persons who served in Forces raised by the Allies of Great
Britain are not eligible for assistance under the Act. The only persons
who did not serve with the A.I.F. and who may be eligible for assistance
are those coming within G.O. 26.
Living and Non-Living Areas.
37. (1) Prior to the inauguration of the Commission a conference
was held between the Minister for Repatriation and the Lands Ministers
of the several States, at which it was decided that any application for
assistance in respect of an area from which an eligible person could
get, or was getting, his living should he submitted to the Lands Depart-
ment for attention in connexion with the Returned Soldiers’ Land
Settlement Scheme, and that those applications from eligible persons
for assistance in respect of areas from which the applicant could not
get, or was not getting, his living, i.e., residential areas, should be dealt
with by the War Service Homes Commission. The foregoing clearly
establishes the line of demarcation, that is, that non-living areas shall
be dealt with by the War Service Homes Commission, and living areas
by the Lands Department in connexion with the Returned Soldiers’
Land Settlement Scheme.
(2) A case arose in one of the States, however, where an eligible
person submitted an application for assistance in respect of a non-
living area which he had created by fencing off home site from the main
holding. Such a case cannot be accepted, as the applicant is a land
settler, and the erection of the fence or even excision of the home site
from the main title cannot overcome the point that the application is in
respect of a living area.
(3) Where an applicant is in possession of an agricultural block,
and applies for assistance in respect of a non-living area within a
town, the proposal may be proceeded with provided the applicant is
not the owner of a dwelling situated on the agricultural block or
elsewhere and his financial circumstances, &c., are satisfactory.
Where, however, the applicant has had assistance under the Returned
Soldiers’ Land Settlement Scheme he must he regarded as a land settler
and the application declined. In no event can an applicant be granted
asssitance concurrently under the Land Settlement Scheme and by the
Commission.
(4) The granting of assistance to ex-land settlers is dealt with in
G.O. 26.
Persons About to Marry.
38. Where an application has been made by a person about to
marry, the Deputy Commissioner will, before eligibility has been
established, have the Statutory Declaration of persons about to


marry (Form 7) completed by the applicant and his fiancee and take
such other action as may he considered necessary in order to satisfy
himself that the applicant will marry within six months. Applications
of this nature must be kept under close review, and action taken to
ascertain whether the applicant marries within the period stated in the
Statutory Declaration.
Certification of Eligibility.
39. (1) On completion of the action laid down in G.O. 26, the
application will be submitted to the Chief Clerk, or other senior officer
deputed by the Deputy Commissioner, for decision as to the applicant’s
eligibility as a person coming within that definition of the Act and
also having regard to Section 28 thereof as to his financial stability and
suitability generally for assistance.
(2) Form 5 will be sent to each applicant whose application
has been refused as to eligibility, and a notation recording the despatch
of same made on the file.
(3) Applications refused as to eligibility will be recorded in the
relative column of the Register of Applications Dealt With, and
providing all other necessary action has been taken the application
will be marked “ File,” and initialed by the officer directing such
action.
(4) Prior to approval as to eligibility, and where an applicant as
shown by Form 1 is in employment, Form 6 will be forwarded to
his employer. When an applicant is not in employment, except in
special cases, it can hardly be assumed that his financial position is
satisfactory, and the application should be submitted to the Deputy
Commissioner for decision before any action is taken in regard thereto.
This action should also be taken where the applicant’s income appears
to be insufficient in connexion with the proposal submitted.
(5) Where it is considered that the eligibility of an applicant
should not be accepted the application is to be submitted to the Deputy
Commissioner for decision.
Purchase of Existing Dwelling Houses.
40. (1) Prior to determination of eligibility all applications for the
purchase of existing dwelling houses or for the discharge of mortgage
will be submitted to the Deputy Commissioner for consideration.
Where a Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that an application could
not reach the stage of approval same may be declined by him on any
of the following grounds:—
(a) No special circumstances coming within categories 1,2, 3
or 4 of clause (3) of this G.O.
( b ) The risk involved is not a reasonable one.
(c) Property undesirable asset because of small area or frontage
of allotment.
( d ) Undesirable asset because of class of construction.
(e) Age.
(2) Particulars of applications for the purchase of existing
dwelling houses or for the discharge of a mortgage will, immediately
after approval as to eligibility and if not declined by the Deputy Com-
missioner, be referred to C.A. for decision as to the admittance of the
1009.—2


application as one containing special circumstances. A recommenda-
tion must be made by the Deputy Commissioner in respect of all cases
submitted to C.A. for decision.
(3) Special circumstances would include the following:—
(1) A disabled soldier who, because of his particular disability
desires to live in close proximity to existing transit
facilities, and suitable land at a reasonable cost is not
available.
(2) Where the property is situated in a country town in which
unoccupied dwellings are already available.
(3) Localities where the facts show it would be a better financial
proposition to buy rather than to build an additional
home.
(4) Where the rate of interest paid is considered excessive
(Cir. memo. A26/4405 of 22nd November, 1926).
(4) Prior to purchase cases being submitted, the Deputy Com-
missioner should satisfy himself that the applicant’s requirements
could not have been met by the granting of assistance in respect of any
of the Commission’s vacated houses, or homes the purchaser of which
desire to transfer their interest. Every endeavour should be made to
dispose of unallotted homes and those available for transfer to appli-
cants who present properties for purchase on their behalf.
(5) In submitting cases under this G.O. the following information
should be furnished.
(a) Date of lodgment of application;
( b ) Amount*of advance applied for;
0) Amount, if any, the applicant has paid or proposes to pay
by way of deposit;
(d ) Particulars of applicant’s employment and financial
position, also number of dependants and sex and ages of
children;
(e) Valuation of dwelling house (if available);
(/) If dwelling house is situated in a country town, available
particulars as to number of population and number of
vacant houses, &c.;
( g ) Particulars as to number of unallotted, vacated, 11 transfer ”
houses in vicinity.
( h ) Special circumstances upon which application is based.
(6) Applications submitted to C.A. for decision as to special cir-
cumstances will be dealt with as provided in G.O. 45, and, if refused,
the applicant advised in accordance with G.O. 39 (2).
Combined Homes and Business Premises.
41. (1) Applications for a combined home and business premises
are outside the general scope of the Commission, and only in very
special circumstances will such be entertained. Such may be regarded
as where the applicant has been trained in some productive vocation
by the Repatriation Department, such as a bootmaker, and desires a
small shop in which to dispose of the articles produced by him.


(2) Where an application is received to build a home and the
applicant proposes also to construct a detached shop, or bakery, or other
building in which to carry on a trade, such should be referred to O.A.
with full particulars including remarks as to the risk involved.
(3) Consideration will also he given to the acquisition of a property
where a trade is carried on in a detached building provided the applica-
tion contains special circumstances, (G.O. 40).
(4) This G.O. does not apply to applications in respect of a hos-
pital, sanatorium, or nursing home, provision for which is contained
in Sections 19 and 20 of the Act.
Assistance for Dual Purpose.
42. Whilst applications for more than one purpose are not invited,
consideration will be given in special circumstances to the acquisition
of a dwelling house and at the same time the enlargement of the home.
Usually assistance is restricted to one purpose, hut in cases such
as the foregoing. the full particulars should be submitted to O.A.
together with advice in accordance with G.O. 40.
Semi-Detached Homes.
43. In no circumstances will assistance be granted in respect of the
acquisition or erection of semi-detached dwelling houses. So many
difficulties, both legal and otherwise, may arise during ownership, that
it has been decided not to include such properties within the provisions
of the Act.
Selection of Group Land.
44. (1) When the sale price of blocks has been approved and
authority has been given to throw an estate open for selection by
applicants, a list of the blocks and the prices at a given date is to be
made available to the General Section, together with a subdivision
plan.
(2) Applicants choosing blocks are to he informed of the price,
with interest added to date of selection, and also that interest will be
charged from the latter date onwards.
(3) Each quarter the list of available land is to be revised by the
Accounts Section and the interest and any other charges added to the
sale prices. The resultant amount should represent the sale price of
any unallotted block to the date of revision.
Valuation.
. 45. (1) After determination of eligibility and, in the case of exist-
ing houses or discharge of mortgage, the admittance of the application
as one containing special circumstances, arrangements will be made to
have the land or land and dwelling house submitted by the applicant
valued.
(2) Eorms AlO or Al 4 will be completed in respect of each valua-
tion made, and a copy of the Form, signed by the officer making the
valuation, placed on the file.
(3) Where the purchase price of any land and/or dwelling house
submitted for purchase by an applicant exceeds the Commission’s


valuation of the property, the case must be submitted to the Deputy
Commissioner for decision before any further action is taken in regard
thereto.
(4) Where the valuation is satisfactory the application will be
referred for survey if the applicant has not already had this service
carried out.
Purchase of Land.
46. The purchase of individual blocks of land for applicants
should not he encouraged, and, where an applicant applies for such
assistance, the Deputy Commissioner should arrange for any of the
Commission’s available land to he placed before the applicant for con-
sideration. If the applicant will not accept one of the Commission’s
building blocks, the Deputy Commissioner may purchase land provided
that: —
(a) the subject land has been inspected and valued, and repre-
sents an approved building site;
(&) a suitable tender has been received which would permit of
the purchase of land and erection of dwelling-house
within the maximum amount available under the Act,
plus any deposit by the applicant; and
(c) in the event of the land being acquired prior to the
acceptance of a tender as laid down in G.O. 83, sufficient
funds will remain available for the completion of the
dwelling-house.
Purchase of Land Where the Valuation is Less than
Purchase Price.
47. (1) Where an applicant requests land to be purchased on his
behalf, such may not be acceded to where the valuation is less than the
purchase price and the applicant has no interest in the land.
(2) Where an applicant has purchased land, the price of which
exceeds the Commission’s valuation, it may be accepted at the
valuation, assuming that it represents a suitable building site.
(3) Where an applicant has contracted to purchase such land, but
has not paid the whole price, he should he informed of the valuation
to enable him to retire from the contract should he so desire, and oil
such terms as he may arrange with the vendor. If, however, he desires
to proceed and the block is a suitable one, an advance not exceeding
the amount of the valuation after deducting the deposit required may
be made. For instance, assuming the purchase price of a block within
the category set out in this G.O. is £l2O, in respect of which the appli-
cant has deposited £lO to the vendor, the valuation being £IOO and the
deposit required being £ls, the Commission would advance £BS and the
applicant would be required to provide in all £35. The contribution
by the applicant in excess of the valuation cannot be taken into account
in fixing the deposit required under the Act.
(4) If a proposal is declined under clause (1), i.e., where an
applicant desires the Commission to advance the whole of the purchase
price and the vendor will not reduce the price within the valuation,


and the applicant (after having been advised of the undesirability of
paying more for the block than the sum at which it is valued) subse-
quently elects to purchase the land, the proposal would then fall either
under clause (2) or (3).
Purchase of Existing Dwelling-House Where the Valuation is Less
than the Purchase Price.
48. (1) Where an applicant has contracted to purchase a
dwelling-house and then applies for assistance, assuming the applica-
tion is admitted under G.O. 40, the proposal would then he dealt with
on the lines of G.O. 47.
(2) Where an applicant has not contracted to purchase a
dwelling-house the subject of his application, assuming that the appli-
cation is admitted under G.O. 40, the proposal would be declined,
as set out in G.O. 39 (2). If, later, the applicant contracts to purchase
the property, the procedure in G.O. 47 would he followed.
Purchase of Group Land.
(a) Plan of Subdivision.
49. (1) Where approval is given to purchase an estate arrange-
ments must he made for the survey to be completed as early as possible.
(2) The plan of subdivision will he prepared by the Lands and
Survey Branch and forwarded to C.A. for consideration and decision.
(b) Extension of Utility Services.
(3) Authority to throw open any estate for selection must be
obtained from C.A. and this will not be given in any case until
provision has been made for the extension of the utility services avail-
able. These services are:—
i Water
ii Gas
iii Electric light
iv Sewerage.
(4) In most cases it will he found that sewerage will not be
available, and in Queensland gas is not largely favoured either as
an illuminant or for cooking purposes.
(5) It may happen that the controlling authority will require the
interest on the expenditure caused by the extension guaranteed, and in
that event the following particulars are necessary:—
i Amount to be guaranteed.
ii Estimate of homes to be built within the period with
figures regarding applications on hand and the stage
they have reached.
iii Rate or other income estimated from use of service.
vi Deficiency and an estimate when such will be eliminated as
result of (iii).


(c) Construction of Roads, &c.
(6) The requirements of municipal councils in the different States
vary so much it is not possible to lay down a definite procedure, but
it can be stated that the construction of the necessary roads and drain-
age will be carried out either: —
i By contract let by the Commission.
ii By contract let by the council after payment of the agreed
upon sum.
(7) Until the services below ground have been extended and the
heavy traffic completed only the ballast is to be laid but it is prefer-
able to leave the road construction, if such can be done having regard
to the soil and configuration of the land, until each section is built
upon.
(8) The kerbing and guttering of streets will depend upon the
requirements of the council and the necessity therefor, and this ques-
tion will be decided in respect of each estate.
(9) It is not proposed to construct footpaths in the development of
an estate.
( d ) Site Inspections.
(10) A reserve will be raised as a developmental cost to cover the
work of site inspections, and as many as possible will be completed in
a continuous period.
(e) Development Costs.
(11) Reserves will be raised to cover all developmental costs,
which will enable the sale prices of the different blocks to be quoted
to applicants when the estate is thrown open and prior probably to the
works involved being carried out.
(/) Fixation of Sale Prices.
(12) It can be safely assumed that the value of any estate is in
excess of its capital cost, and consequently it is necessary to ensure that
each block after elimination of unsuitable land, &c., shall obtain an
equal proportion of the excess value. Assuming, therefore, the capital
cost placed on the building blocks is £lO,OOO and the valuation £12,000
then each block would be costed as under: —
10 valuation of block
- x £ sale price.
12
(13) Schedules showing the valuation of each block, proposed
reserves and sale prices, &c., are to be forwarded to C.A. for approval.
( g ) Waste Land.
(14) What is considered waste land in any proposed group, i.e.,
land not suitable for building, is not to carry any liability or boundary
fencing costs.
(15) Where an applicant selects land adjoining on waste land he is
to be informed that the whole cost of boundary fence shall be borne
by him and his concurrence obtained on the file.


(16) To ensure that waste land will not he overlooked, each block
will be debited with 10s., the credit entry being made in an account
styled “ Waste Land Suspense Account.” When the land is disposed
of the entries will be reversed.
Survey.
50. (1) After valuation, if such is satisfactory, arrangements will
be made to have the land surveyed.
(2) Form Al 2 (Identification Survey) will be completed in respect
of each survey made and a copy of the Form, signed by the Surveyor,
placed on the file.
(3) Where the survey is unsatisfactory then the application should
be declined.
Site Inspections.
51. (1) Where such is considered necessary by the Chief Architect
a site inspection will be carried out.
(2) In the case of single allotments the site inspection will be made
wherever possible by the Surveyor at the time the valuation and survey
are carried out.
(3) In country districts the applicant will be forwarded the proper
form and advised to arrange for the service locally.
Titles Office Search.
52. Applications (excepting those for the erection of a dwelling-
house on land owned by the Commission) after determination of
eligibility and the admittance of the application as one containing
special circumstances (G.O. 40), and after valuation and survey
have been made (G.O.’s 45 and 50), will be forwarded to the Legal
Section for Titles Office search. (G.O. 103.)
Defective Titles.
53. Cases which have been referred to the Deputy Commissioner
by the Legal Section as result of a defect in the Title which cannot
be overcome (G.O. 103 (2) ), will be formally refused by the Deputy
Commissioner and the jacket passed to the General Section for advice
to applicant (Form 5) and notation in the Register of Applications
Dealt With. The jacket will then be referred to the Accountant for
check of unexpended fees and refund of such, if necessary. When
action is complete the jacket will be passed to Records Section for
filing.
Fees and Charges.
54. (1) All fees must be paid in advance and should be lodged
with the application, and no service is to be authorized until the fee
therefor has been received, excepting the charge at the prescribed rate
to cover cost of preparing plans and supervision of construction in
major cases, which may be included in the cost of construction.
.(2) All fees should be requested not later than the time advice is
sent to an applicant that his eligibility has been approved.


Country Architects.
'55. (1) In Hew South Wales and Queensland agreements have been
entered into with practising Architects who have been appointed to act
in defined areas.
(2) In connexion with the construction of dwelling-houses and
additions, the country Architect will —
(a) Upon being supplied by the Commission with plans and
specifications of a dwelling-house call for public tenders
for the construction in accordance with these plans and
specifications;
( b ) With respect to tenders make recommendations to the
Commission as to their acceptance or otherwise;
(c) Upon receiving the Commission’s instructions procure the

dwelling-house, furnish a valuation thereof, and report to the Com-
mission as to the stability of the dwelling-house from the point of
view of construction and as to the advisability of advancing money
on the security of such land and dwelling-house.
(4) Transfer Cases. —The country Architect will, when requested
by the Commission, inspect any land and dwelling-house, furnish a
valuation of any permanent improvements carried out by and at the
expense of the applicant and report to the Commission.
(5) Periodical Inspections. —The country Architect will, when
requested by the Commission, inspect any dwelling-house which is the
subject of an application under the said Act at such periods as may
be determined by the Commission, and report with full details of any
repairs that may be necessary and whether such dwelling-house is
being kept in good order and repair.


(6) Repairs (General). —Where an applicant has been called
upon to execute repairs under Section 31 of the Act, the country
Architect will, when requested by the Commission, make arrangements
to have the repairs carried out, supervise the work, and inspect and
report as to whether such repairs have been executed satisfactorily.
(7) Repairs (Insurance) . —In connexion with the inspections and
reports for purposes of the War Service Homes Insurance Scheme the
country Architect will, at the request of the Commission—
1. (a) inspect any dwelling-house insured under the Act;
(b) report on the damage done to such dwelling-house by
fire, flood, lightning, or tempest;
(c) furnish an estimate of the cost of making good such

(d) obtain quotations for the execution of repairs necessary
to make good the damage where such repairs are
estimated to cost less than £5O, superintend execution

(e) where cost of repairs is estimated to exceed £5O, and
it is necessary to prepare plans and specifications for
I the purpose of obtaining tenders, the Architect will
be instructed to carry out this work in addition to

(b) report whether such repairs have been carried out
satisfactorily.
Applications Board.
56. (1) All applications must be submitted to the Board in their
respective jackets.
(2) The Board will consist of the Chief Clerk (or other senior
clerical officer) as Chairman, with the Senior Conveyancer and
Accountant as members. The Board will meet as required and make
a recommendation in each case to the Deputy Commissioner in space
provided for this purpose on the application form.
(3) After the Deputy Commissioner has given a decision in
respect of each application the file will be transferred for completion of
the entry in the Register of Applications Dealt With. Subsequent
action will be as set out in clause (4).
(4) Form 11 will be forwarded to an applicant whose application
has been approved, and the despatch thereof noted on the
file. The file will then be passed to the Legal Section for further


action in connexion with settlement and preparation of the security
document if the application is in respect of an existing property, or
to the Chief Architect if the application is in respect of the erec-
tion of a home. When a satisfactory tender has been received in a
building case a Form A 3 will he submitted to the Deputy Commis-
sioner by the Chief Architect, and after the Deputy Commissioner’s
approval is obtained for the acceptance of the tender the file will be
referred in accordance with the direction on Form A 3.
(5) Where an application has been refused by the Deputy Com-
missioner Form 5 will be forwarded to the applicant and the despatch

f Activities.
57. (1) All the monthly returns will be prepared as at the last
working day in each month, and, after being carefully checked, will be
submitted to C.A. immediately at the close of the month to which they
refer.
(2) Each month a return compiled in the manner set out in
Forms 12 and 17 is to be forwarded.
(3) Each month a return in the prescribed form is to be forwarded
to C.A. setting out the following:—
(a) Particulars of houses sold during month;
(b) A summary showing—
(i) Number unallotted at end of previous month.
(ii) Number reverted during month.
(iii) Number sold to (a) applicants, (b) civilians
during the month.
(iv) Number tenanted.
(v) Number vacant.
Maximum Loans.
58. (1) The maximum loan in ordinary cases is £BOO, and in special
cases £950.
(2) Some difficulty arises in this regard as the £BOO may not be
exceeded unless it is to provide essential accommodation for an
applicant’s family or dependants.
(3) As a basis for handling new applications the maximum of
£BOO shall be regarded as sufficient to provide land, fencing, and a
dwelling of four rooms, i.e., two bedrooms, living room, kitchen,
laundry, lavatory, and sewerage when available, but not the cost of
roads, footpaths, right-of-way, kerbing, or channelling. Supposing,
therefore, that an applicant has a family consisting of one child, or one
dependant only, the maximum of £BOO will apply.
(4) Where a verandah is necessary from a climatic point of view,
or a sleep-out because of the health of an applicant or any of his
dependants, such may be provided and a loan in excess of £BOO but
within £950 granted.
(5) Advances in excess of £BOO cannot be made to provide
accommodation for domestic help or nurses employed by applicants.

Rate of Interest.
59. (1) The rate of interest to be charged on all loans is 5 per
cent, per annum.
(2) The method of raising the interest charges in the loan
accounts is set out in G.O. 153.
Loans for Repairs.
60. The purposes for which loans may he made available are
set out in Section 20 and G.O. 107. The responsibility for keeping a
property in good order and repair rests upon each applicant, which is
covered by G.O. 70.
Deposits.
61. (1) Section 19, Sub-section (3) (a) and (b) of the Act
provides that the Commission may require a deposit of not more than
5 per centum to he lodged in any case.
(2) The minimum deposit is £lO, hut in any case a deposit shall
he required having regard to the risk involved in the proposal. (G.O.
62 (3) ).
(3) Where the deposit fixed is greater than £lO the applicant
should lodge this sum as a preliminary deposit and the balance when
called upon. After approval of a “ building ” case further action
should not be taken until the preliminary deposit at least is received.
(4) The amount of deposit where an additional advance is approved
shall he at least £lO, or such sum which, with the deposit lodged pre*-
viously, will equal £lO.
(5) Applicants should he made aware that the Commission cannot
allow interest on any deposit.
(6) The three important points to he borne in mind when consider-
ing any application for a loan are —
(a) Financial stability and suitability of the applicant for
assistance. (Section 28 of the Act.)
(b) Deposit.
(c) Risk as defined in Section 24 of the Act.
Fixation of Loan Term.
62. (1) The maximum periods for the repayment of loans are
set out in Section 29, and are as under:—
Class of Construction.
(2) In the case of homes constructed by the Commission the
maximum term applicable to the class of construction will be allowed.


(3) Where a dwelling-house is acquired by purchase or discharge
of mortgage the term is to be fixed, having regard to the inspection
report, the risk involved, and the ability of the Commission to dispose
of the home without loss should a forced sale become necessary owing
to the possible reversion of the home at any time in the future.
Approval to Second Mortgages.
63. (1) Although the Act does not specifically provide for second
mortgages, there is nothing in it to prevent approval to such. It has,
therefore, been decided to favorably consider applications to raise
money by second mortgage where the applicant requires a sum, in
addition to the amount advanced to him, for the purpose of erecting
a dwelling-house larger than that which could be provided with the
amount of the advance, and other special cases. All such applications
with the full facts and particulars of loan, instalment, liability, &c.,
should be forwarded, covered by a recommendation, to C.A. for deci-
sion.
(2) Any approval given will be without prejudice to the Com-
mission’s rights under the Act and Regulations, and, consequently, the
proposed second mortgage should be perused to ensure that the
Commission’s rights are not jeopardized.
(3) If the perusal is carried out by the Crown Solicitor or his
representative the applicant will be required to pay the cost of the
service. If the perusal is made by the Commission, then the appro-
priate charge to the applicant will be made to cover the service in
connexion with the second mortgage, which includes also the service
of producing the title for registration.
Removal of Dwelling-house.
64. (1) Applications to remove a dwelling-house from one town
to another, or from one block to another in the same town, should be
submitted to C.A. for consideration.
(2) Particulars required include: —
(a) Reason for application;
( b ) Whether the applicant will meet cost of removal, or
whether a loan is desired and, if so, the amount;
(c) Original loan, present liability, deposit, principal repay-
ment, and instalment;
( a nd) Present valuation;
(e) Valuation of proposed new site and if applicant is owner.
If not, amount of assistance required, &c.;
(/) Valuation of dwelling-house after erection on new site;
( g ) Applicant’s employment, wages, family, &c.
Insolvency of an Applicant.
65. (1) When information is received that an applicant’s estate has
been sequestrated and before advice is given either to the insolvent
or the assignee or trustee as to whether or not the Commission will
exercise its powers under Section 33 of the Act the assignee or trustee
should be lequested to submit the following:—
(a) A statement of the assets and liabilities;
(b) A report on the insolvent’s conduct and affairs.


(2) The reports by the trustee should he submitted to C.A. for
decision, together with the following particulars: —
(а) Nature of security and amount;
(б) Additional advances or amounts guaranteed for sewerage,
&c.;
(c) Date;
(and) Location of dwelling-house;
(e) Amount of deposit;-
(/) Principal repaid;
(#) Estimated value by applicant of improvements effected by
him;
( h ) Arrears covering instalments and rates;
( i ) General remarks.
Advances for Extra Accommodation.
66. (1) Applications for further assistance to provide additional
living accommodation for an applicant and his family are to he sub-
mitted to C.A. for decision, together with the following information
(a) Price of dwelling-house to applicant;
(i) advance;
(ii) deposit.
(b) Commission’s valuation (if any) at time of purchase;
(c) Amount of applicant’s equity in property;
( a nd) Amount of further assistance applied for;
(e) Purpose for which further assistance desired;
(/) Necessity therefor;
(g) The extent the valuation will he increased if the loan
requested is granted;
(h) Nature of applicant’s dealings with the Commission.
(2) Applications under this G.O. will not he considered from
applicants who are in arrears with their payments. The primary
object of granting additional assistance is to enable satisfactory
applicants who have not already received the maximum amount of
advance to obtain additional and necessary accommodation for the
housing of their family.
(3) Advances in this regard may he made up to the maximum of
£950. (G.O. 58.)
(4) Loans may he made up to the maximum of £BOO to provide
items necessary from a climatic point of view, such as shades over
windows, verandahs, enclosing verandahs, &c., hut where the £BOO
maximum will he exceeded the provisions of G.O. 58 must he complied
with.
Advances for Utility Services.
67. (1) Additional assistance may be made available to cover the
provision of all or any of the following services, provided the amount
of the advance in the aggregate does not exceed £800:
(a) Roadmaking (including kerbing and guttering);
(b) Water service;
(c) Electric light;
(and) Gas;
(e) Sewerage;
(/) Drainage;


The Deputy Commissioner may in any case require the applicant to
make arrangements direct with controlling bodies in regard to road-
making or sewerage, the applicant meeting the cost in accordance
with the deferred payment system available by the body concerned.
(2) With regard to items (c) and (and), it is to be noted that further
assistance cannot be made available for the provision of such service
where either gas or electric light has been installed. Applicants
whose properties have been provided with gas lighting cannot obtain
assistance for the installation of electric light, or vice versa.
(3) Where an applicant who has received the maximum amount
of advance, i.e., £BOO, requires additional assistance to provide for the
carrying out of any of the services referred to in clause (1) excluding
sewerage, the matter may be referred to C.A. with a recommenda-
tion for consideration in conjunction with Section 18a of the Act. Only
where exceptional circumstances exist will the case be so considered.
(4) The procedure to be followed in connexion with the pro-
vision of sewerage where the full advance of £BOO has been made
available, or where the balance is insufficient to cover the cost of the
work, is for the applicant to enter into arrangements with the con-
trolling body to pay the cost under a deferred payment system, the
Deputy Commissioner, if necessary, guaranteeing the instalments due
by the applicant from time to time. Care should be exercised to
ensure that the applicant, in a proper document, gives the Com-
mission the right to regard the amount due as money payable under
the contract of sale or mortgage, so that the Commission may exercise
its powers in respect of any such applicant who defaults in his pay-
ments to the controlling body and the Commission is compelled to
make good the deficiency.
(5) Where an advance is made there are two methods by which
the actual installation can be arranged. The first is to ask the
applicant to submit at least three quotes for the work, and, if the
lowest is satisfactory, to request him to have the work carried out,
obtain the necessary certificate from the Water Board or other
authority, and to pay the claim on the certificate issued by the Board.
Where the work is for the connexion of sewerage the applicant in the
case mentioned would be required to obtain from the Water Board
the sewerage plan and pay the cost to that body direct. The second
method would be for the Commission to obtain" the plan, the quotes
let the tender, and pay for the work on receipt of the certificate from
the Water Board.
Sale of Portion of Land Included in a Security.
. 6s - C l .) Application for permission to sell any portion of the land
included m a security may be approved by the Deputy Commissioner,
providing—
(a) such excision will not depreciate the property as a saleable
proposition, and the balance of land remaining has a
suitable frontage and depth conforming to the area of
blocks in the immediate vicinity;
(b) the approval of the municipal council and any other
authority is first obtained as to —
(i) the proposed excision;


(ii) the block to be retained to ensure that it will
comply with the necessary requirements as
to frontage or area, or otherwise;
(c) the ratio of the applicant’s liability to the value of the
property after the proposed sale will he at least equal
to what it was before;
( a nd) the net proceeds of the sale are paid to the Commission
to he credited to the applicant’s personal loan account in
reduction of principal owing.
(2) Should there be any special features, which in the opinion
of a Deputy Commissioner warrant consideration of a request by the
applicant for retention of any part of the proceeds, full particulars
are to he submitted to C.A. for decision.
(3) Applications to sell land with buildings erected thereon, or
buildings only, should be referred to C.A.
Repairs.
69. (1) A Deputy Commissioner may expend a sum not exceeding
£lO in effecting minor repairs to a property (not abandoned or
vacated) provided it is evident that such repairs are due to faulty
construction or lack of supervision at the time the property was
erected, and provided the facts are reported to C.A. together with the
report of the officer responsible.
(2) Where there is any doubt as to the Commission’s respon-
sibility after a full review of the circumstances, or where the estimated
cost of repairs exceeds £lO, then the case must be submitted to C.A.
together with full particulars.
(3) In the case of abandoned or vacated properties a Deputy
Commissioner may, where such will enhance the prospects of disposal
or are necessary to effectively maintain the property, carry out minor
repairs and renovations (including external painting).
(4) Cases where the repairs are extensive, including those due to
faulty construction (clause 1) should be submitted to C.A. with full
particulars for consideration as to a sale of the property in its then
state or after completion of certain repairs.
(5) In the case of properties transferred from one eligible person
to another, necessary repairs of a minor nature only may be effected,
provided the cost of such repairs is borne by either the transferror
or transferee applicant. The cost of repairs effected under this clause
should not exceed £25, and wdiere such cost is to be met by the trans-
feree applicant the Deputy Commissioner may, within his discretion,
arrange for the cost to be spread over a period not exceeding three years
with interest at the prescribed rate added thereto.
Execution of Repairs.
70. (1) When it is found that a purchaser or borrower has failed to
keep in good and tenantable repair all buildings, fences, fixtures, and
improvements upon the land comprised in the contract of sale, mort-
gage, or other security, a notice shall be served on such purchaser or
borrower by posting same in a prepaid letter addressed to such pur-
chaser or borrower at the dwelling-house purchased for, or in respect
of which an advance has been made by the Commission, or at the


last-known address of the person for whom such notice is intended.
In the case of a purchaser Form LI shall he used, and in the case of
a borrower Form L 2, and in the schedule thereto shall be inserted the
repairs required to be carried out.
(2) In the event of the purchaser or borrower not executing the
repairs specified in the notice within the period therein mentioned a
Deputy Commissioner may take the action particularly set out in
Section 31, sub-section (2) ( b ) of the Act.
(3) Should a Deputy Commissioner deem that action under Section
31, sub-section (2) ( b ) of the Act inadvisable, the action set out in
Section 31 sub-section (2) (a) of the Act will be taken. The latter
action should be taken only in special cases in view of the fact that a
primary condition of any contract or mortgage is that the purchaser or
borrower must maintain the property in good order and repair.
Transfers Between Applicants.
I n every case where an application to transfer is received
the suitability of the home as a security under the Act must be
considered, having regard to the locality, class of construction, &c.,
and, if sufficient particulars are not available in the office, an inspec-
tion and valuation are to be made at the cost of the applicant
desiring to transfer, as set out in Gr.O. 45. If the property is not
suitable the application to transfer is to be declined, and the applicant
advised to sell on the open market and discharge his liability to the
Commission.
(2) The basis of the transfer price will be—
(a) Original cost plus capital cost of sewerage, roadmaking.
and/or footpaths, or valuation, whichever is the lesser,
plus
(b) Definite and certified improvements as detailed in C.A.
memorandum D. 1773 of the 3rd February, 1923, at
the Commission’s valuation, plus
(c) Stamp. duty, registration fees, costs of compulsory
acquisition and survey fees, where evidence of payment
of these is produced by the applicant desiring to trans-
fer.
(3) Where the figure arrived at as in clause (2) is greater than the
present valuation then the transfer price must not exceed the latter.
(4) Where the original valuation is less than the cost price,
and the present valuation is greater, then the transfer price should
be arrived at as under:—
(a) Original cost plus capital cost of sewerage, roadmaking.
and/or footpaths, plus
(b) Definite and certified improvements as detailed in C.A
memorandum D. 1773 of the 3rd February, 1923, at
the Commission’s valuation, plus
(c) Stamp duty, registration fees, costs of compulsorv
acquisition and survey fees, where evidence of payment
of these is produced by the applicant desiring to transfer,
bnt in no case is the transfer price to exceed the present
valuation.
(D f


Purchase of Equities.
72. (1) Where the present valuation or valuation if repairs were
effected is greater by at least £2O than what would be the approved
transfer price in accordance with the foregoing, and the property
is a desirable security and is readily saleable at the valuation price,
then the applicant’s interest in the property should be purchased under
Section 29a, and the property resold at the present valuation under
that Section, but a Deputy Commissioner may, in his discretion, having
regard to all the circumstances, approve a transfer in accordance with
the terms of this G.O. Where it is decided to purchase an equity the
amount will be arrived at as under: —
(a) Deposit .. .. . . .. £
(b) Principal repaid .. . . £
(c) Improvements covering also sewerage, road-
making, ‘footpath, &c., not included in
the purchase price to the purchaser
or borrower .. . . . . £
£
Less (a) Interest due £
(&) Amounts owing for sew-
erage, roadmaking, or
footpath, etc £
(c ) Rates outstanding ... £ £
Equity £ less
(1) Interest accruing subsequent to date of prepara-
tion of statement.
(2) Additional interest in respect of item ( b ).
(3) Rates additional to the sum in item (c).
'U' r (4) Legal and other charges due at settlement.
4
($) Any applicant who desires to discharge his liability is to he
permitted to do so at any time.
(*8) In cases wherein the proposed transferror has a large equity
in a property which is otherwise not considered a reasonable risk or
security (such as a dwelling-house in a small country town) transfers
should only he approved on the basis of an assignment of the con-
tract or mortgage, the transferee paying to the transferror the amount
approved as the latter’s equity. In other words, the Commission will
not buy out the proposed transferror applicant’s equity and sell to
another eligible person on a small deposit.
'I
(-4) Where the property to be transferred is the subject of a mort-
gage to the Commission, the transfer price will be fixed as in G.O.
71 (2), but the mortgagor will be paid the difference between the sum
owing by him, including adjustment of rates, insurance, &c., and
moneys paid under (7), and the transfer price.
(fi) In the case of a contract of sale, no part of the principal
repaid must be refunded to the transferror applicant unless the amount
of deposit (if any) paid by him, plus the amount repaid on account


of principal, is equal to or greater than 10 per cent, of the pur-
chase price of the property. Where the sum of such amount equals
or exceeds 10 per cent, of the capital cost the applicant is to be
treated as mortgagor on the basis set out in (4).
(?) transferror has not a 10 per cent, equity as ex-
plained in (i) hut originally paid a deposit or any of the fees
as set out in this G. 0., he shall he refunded so much out of the
deposit or fees as is left after deducting the total assistance from
the transfer price fixed in accordance with this G.O. less sums owing
by him, including arrears and moneys paid under ('7). An example
of this procedure is as follows: 7 £
Transfer price .. . . • • 800
Original advance . . .. . . 760
Deposit .. .. •. • • 60
Principal repaid .. .. * .. 10
Pees .. .. • • . • 10
(Where the deposit was paid direct by the ap-
plicant to the vendor, proper proof must he
submitted).
In this case the applicant will receive £4O on account of deposit
and fees less any sums, including arrears, due to the Commission.,
Another example, where improvements are included in the trans-
fer price, is:—
Transfer price (including improvements £
approved at £2O) .. .. .. 800
Original advance . . .. . • 760
Deposit .. .. • • • • 60
Principal repaid .. .. .. 10
Pees . . .. • • • • 10
In this case the applicant will receive £2O ( less any sums, including
arrears, due to the Commission) on account of deposit and fees, and £2O
for approved improvements.
N.B. — (a) In these examples the principal repaid should be for-
feited.
(b) The fees referred to herein are not to be taken into
consideration when determining if the applicant has a
10 per cent, equity.
(7>) Whether the transfer price is fixed at cost or at valuation, such
transfer price will include moneys (if any) owing to the proper
authority for sewerage, road-making, and/or footpaths. It will, there-
fore, be necessary for a Deputy Commissioner to see that any such
amounts so owing are deducted from moneys payable to an outgoing
applicant under this G. 0., and that such moneys are paid to the
authority concerned. If, however, for good reasons it is decided by a
Deputy Commissioner that the incoming applicant should continue with
the payments of the outgoing applicant direct to the authority then the
consent of such authority will be obtained, and the transfer price corre-
spondingly reduced. Notation of all action taken under this clause
will be made on the file.


(8) In any case where the valuation is less than the cost price of
the property, the excess will not appear in the accounts, but details
should he plainly set out on the file for ready reference in the event of
a future transfer.
Improvements.
73. In dealing with transfer cases, the term “ improvements ” will
he taken to mean tangible things which add to the value of the property,
and which have been provided subsequent to the purchase of the
dwelling-house by the transferror applicant. Detailed instructions are
set out in C.A. memorandum D. 1773, dated 3rd February, 1923.
Resale of Abandoned Homes.
74. (1) Any property which reverts to the Commission, either by
way of ejectment proceedings, vacation by an applicant, or for any
other reason, shall be (unless the property represents an undesirable
security for retention under the Act) offered for selection by eligible
persons awaiting provision of a home.
(2) As soon as advice of abandoned property is received it should be
inspected and valued and the resale price fixed, having regard to
whether, where repairs are necessary, these are to be carried out or not.
(3) Where it is decided to effect repairs (see G.O. 69 (3) ), and an
applicant is available who is willing to purchase at the resale price,
then, subject to the actual work to be done, he could be sold the
property and given occupancy.
(4) Resale prices will be fixed by C.A., and to enable this to he
done the prescribed form is to be completed and forwarded immediately
the inspection report is received.
(5) As all resales will be at valuation under Section 28b, whereiu
any case this exceeds the outstanding liability plus balance of sewerage
and road-making cost, rates, charges, &c., a Deputy Commissioner may
offer the property to eligibles and effect a sale at this figure.
(6) Dwelling-houses which are not considered desirable securities
will not be available for applicants, but will be sold on the open
market.
(7) Where the Commissioner is mortgagee in possession, great care
must be exercised to ensure that the requirements of Section 36 of the
Act are complied with before any sale is made, and in c.ontract of sale
cases that the contract of sale has been regularly cancelled, and that a
notation is made on each file by the Deputy Commissioner at the time of
cancellation, and that all instalments and other moneys previously paid
by the applicant concerned have been forfeited under Section 36, sub-
section (1) (a) of the Act.
Sales to Civilians.
75. (1) Where an approved applicant is not immediately available,
or where a property is not considered a desirable security, efforts should
be made to dispose of the property on the open market with or without
the aid of agents, as decided by the Deputy Commissioner.
(2) Where it is decided to use agents, then all in the district, and
any others who would be likely to influence a sale, are to be given
particulars of the property (in writing), together with the net reserve,


where the keys are located, and advice that, should a person who declares
he is eligible, or who is found to be eligible prior to the completion of a
sale on terms, no fees will be payable as the Commission does not piopose
to pay agents to secure applicants. Agreement in this is a condition
precedent to the employment of an agent in respect of any home.
(3) The following terms may be offered under this G. 0.:
Deposit. —Minimum, £25.
Interest. —Qi per cent, on monthly balances.
Period of Loan.—Hot greater than fifteen years, at the end of
which period the balance owing shall become due and
payable upon demand.
Eate of Eepayment. —Hot less than £4 per month, to he increased
in the discretion of the Deputy Commissioner according
to the balance outstanding.
Security.—Contract of sale.
(4) Agents should be advised that the Commission is prepared to
consider near offers, and, where a Deputy Commissioner is of opinion
that an offer less than the reserve should be accepted, such should be
telegraphed to C.A. with suitable remarks.
(5) Where the valuation of a property exceeds the outstanding
liability, plus balance of sewerage and road-making cost, rates, chaiges,
fcc., and it comes within clause (1), then if the sale price has not
already been fixed by C.A., the property may he offered for sale at a
figure not less than the valuation.
(6) Where the Commissioner is mortgagee in possession, great care
must he exercised to ensure that the requirements of Section 36 of the
Act are complied with before any sale is made, and in contract of sale
cases that the contract of sale has been regularly cancelled, and that a
notation is made on each file by the Deputy Commissioner at the time of
cancellation, that all instalments and other moneys previously paid
by the applicant concerned have been forfeited under Section 36, sub-
section (1) (a) of the Act.
Sales to Deserted Wives.
76. In the case of a contract of sale where a property has reverted to
the Commission through the default of an applicant and proof has been
obtained that such applicant has deserted his wife, she shall, provided
there is a reasonable prospect of her being able to purchase the
property, he given first offer to purchase the property as an ineligible
person at a price equal to the total net liability, including rates, &c.,
owing in respect of the property, or valuation, whichever is the higher.
Deceased Applicants.
77. (1) Where an applicant dies leaving his interest in a war ser-
vice home as the only or principal asset in his estate, and the widow
is not in a position to incur the expense of obtaining Probate or
Letters of Administration, the following procedure is to be adopted:
( a ) In contract of sale cases where the applicant dies intestate
or where there is a will, and the interest is left to the
widow.


Should the instalments fall into arrears to the extent of three
calendar months, action as provided in Section 36 of the
Act is to he taken, and the property may then he sold to
the widow at a price equal to the total net liability owing
to the Commission on the property plus any rates, &c.
(&) In contract of sale cases where there is a will and the
interest is left to the widow and children.
No action is to be taken by the Commission, but the case will
be treated in accordance with the usual practice of con-
veyancing, Letters of Administration or Probate being
insisted upon. Unless the executor, administrator, or
beneficiary is able to arrange and also have the widow
registered as the proprietor by assignment a fresh
security cannot be taken nor can the widow be granted
extended terms.
(c) In all mortgage cases where there is a will and the interest is
left to the widow or widow and children.
No action is to be taken by the Commission, but the case will
be treated in accordance with the usual practice of con-
veyancing, Letters of Administration or Probate being
insisted upon. Unless the executor, administrator, or
beneficiary is able to arrange and also have the widow
registered as the proprietor in fee simple subject to the
mortgage a fresh security cannot be taken nor can the
widow be granted extended terms.
(2) In Queensland where in consequence of State law a home
may be transmitted to a civilian under a will or by the Public Curator
where the applicant dies intestate without contravening Section 35 of
the Act, the following will apply: —
(a) In contract of sale or mortgage cases where 'the applicant
dies intestate and the widow is the sole beneficiary or
where there is a will and the mterest is left to the widow.
In these cases the widow will become by transmission the
proprietor of the deceased’s interest under the contract of
sale or mortgage, and if she desires the extended terms for
widows then same may be approved in the ordinary way
by arrangement for the existing security to be cancelled
and anew one taken. Anew application by the widow
would be signed.
(b) In contract of sale or mortgage cases where the applicant
dies intestate and persons other than or in addition to the
widow are beneficiaries or where there is a will and the
interest is left to persons other than or in addition to the
widow.
No action will be taken by the Commission, but the case will
be treated according to the usual practice of conveyancing.
In these cases unless the executor or administrator or
beneficiary is able to so arrange and actually does have
the widow registered as the proprietor in the case of a
contract of sale by assignment, and in the case of a
mortgage in fee simple subject to the mortgage, it will not
be possible to take a fresh security and grant the widow
extended terms.


Payment of Rates by Commission.
78. (1) Municipal and other rates owing upon a property as at
the date of transfer from one applicant to another will be adjusted
between the parties as at the date of settlement.
(a) Contract of Sale Cases.
(2) On the resale of a home where the previous purchaser is not
available the Commission will pay not more than one year’s rates.
(3) Where the previous purchaser is available and the council or
other authority shows that it has exhausted all avenues to collect but
without success the Commission will pay not more than one year’s
rates.
(4) In no case will rates be recognized in respect of periods during
which properties are vacant.
( b ) Mortgage Cases.
(5) Where the Commission becomes mortgagee in possession rates
outstanding will be paid, and also those struck prior to the sale of the
dwelling-house, subject to usual adjustment with the purchaser.
(c) Tenancy Cases.
(6) Where a tenant is placed in a property by the Commission the
amount of rental will be fixed covering rates also, and all rates will be
paid by the Commission.
( a nd) General.
(7) When the Commission pays rates such is subject to the council
waiving any charge for interest.
(8) All rating authorities should advise the Commission of all rates
owing on war service homes within one month after the final date for
payment without implication of interest, and on lists being received the
applicants are to be communicated with and instructed to arrange for
payment with the rating authority and the matter followed up.
(9) All rating authorities should agree to satisfy telephonic and
other requests for statements of outstanding rates and other charges
without payment of any fee.
(10) The preceding clauses apply to rating authorities which have
accepted the general rating arrangements but clauses (5) and (6) apply
to all.
(e) Sewerage, Kerbing, Guttering, and Roach-making Charges.
(11) On the resale of abandoned homes, where the sale price fixed
covers the property with sewerage installed, road made and kerbing
and guttering, then the charges for these items (including interest),
are to be discharged, or, if the purchaser so desires and the particular
authority agrees, paid direct to the authority in instalments. In the
latter case the purchaser is to acknowledge the liability by an endorse-
ment on the file, and the resale price will be reduced by the amount
of the charge.
Payment of Rates where Applicant in Possession.
79. (1) The payment of rates by the Commission in respect of
abandoned properties is dealt with in G.O. 78.


(2) Where an applicant in occupation requires the Commission to
pay rates, such are not to be paid unless the applicant has a credit in
the Sinking Fund Account.
(3) Assuming such a credit exists, the procedure will he as
follows: —
(a) Use instalments (as paid), and operate on Sinking Fund
Account to pay instalments.
( b ) Where there is an insufficient Sinking Fund Account credit
pay the equivalent from instalments and operate the
Sinking Fund Account to meet the instalments so used.
(c) Where there is no Sinking Fund Account credit inform the
applicant that he must make arrangements direct with the
rating body.
(4) All Sinking Fund Account operations must be made on the first
of each month when the instalment is due and payable, and in accord-
ance with G.O. 156.
Assignment of Contract.
80. (1) Where a civilian desires to assign a contract of
sale entered into by him with the Commission for the purchase of land,
or land and dwelling-house, the Commission will not give approval
therto, although this will not affect the civilian’s right of
assignment at common law, and if the civilian proceeds and
assigns he should be informed in writing that the Commission does not
free him from the contract, and that it will look to him for its com-
pletion.
(2) Where a purchaser desires to be relieved of his obligation under
a contract the course to he suggested is that he should obtain finance
privately and discharge his liability to the Commission, and thereupon
obtain the title deeds to the property.
(3) Under no circumstances will the transfer to an eligible person
of a property being purchased from the Commission by a civilian he
approved.
(4) When an assignment has been effected by a purchaser, his card
will be noted as to such assignment with full particulars of the assignee’s
name, occupation, and address, and the date of such assignment. A
suitable notation will also be made on the assignee’s card in order that
the Commission’s rights against both parties will not be overlooked.
(5) Where the assignee defaults under the assigned contract of sale
care must be exercised to give the required notices under the contract of
sale to both the original purchaser and the assignee, as both are liable
for the moneys involved.
Second Assistance under the Act.
81. (1) Sections 19b and 20a of the Act provide in effect that,
except with the approval of the Minister no applicant can he assisted
in the provision of a dwelling-house on more than one occasion.
(2) All applications under this G.O. shall he forwarded to C.A. with
particulars as to the applicant’s prior dealing with the Commission,
the proposal in regard to which a loan is desired, and whether a
transfer or unallotted home is available in locality, and, if so, details
concerning it.


PART 3.—CONSTRUCTION SECTION.
Preparation of Plans.
82. (1) When all preliminary work is completed the applicant
should be requested to call and state his requirements in order that plans
and specifications may be prepared and tenders invited. The applicant
must endorse his approval on the qdans and specifications before tenders
are invited.
(2) An applicant may choose a type plan or arrange for a special
plan to be prepared, and such alteration as he requires will be carried
out providing the result will be a suitable security for the amount to be
expended or advanced by the Commission.
Construction.
83. (1) All major works will be carried out under contracts let
after public tender and in accordance with the plans, specifications and
General Conditions of Contract.
(2) Tenders will be invited by advertisement in the principal daily
newspapers, and where tenders are invited concurrently for different
works only one advertisement shall appear, the works being stated
separately. Close check will require to be kept so that when the time
for submitting tenders for one of the works mentioned expires reference
to that work will not appear in the next issue of the advertisement.
(3) (a) The Postmaster-General’s Department will assist the Com-
mission in the work of calling tenders for the erection of homes in coun-
try districts, hut the scope of such will be limited to the exhibition of
notices inviting tenders, supplying of tender forms, plans and specifica-
tions to contractors on application, and witnessing of signatures to con-
tracts entered into by the Commission.
( b ) The arrangement with the Postmaster-General’s Department
operates in those localities where there is no branch of the R.5.5.1.L.A.,
or where the local governing body of the League is not prepared to
assist the Commission in this work.
(c) A supply of tender forms, notices, plans and specifications, &c.,
will be made available to the various country post offices or branches of
the League as required. When forwarding matter to those offices a
stamped addressed envelope must be enclosed for the return of contract
documents, plans and specifications, &c. Neither the Postmaster-Gen-
eral’s Department nor the Returned Soldiers’ League will bear any
expense in connexion with the supply of stationery or other matter, and
all postage on correspondence to or from postmasters or branches of the
League is to he borne by the Commission.
(4) All tenders, which must he completed on Porm Al r
will be deposited in the tender box and will not be opened until after
the closing time and then only by the Chief Clerk (or senior clerical
officer) and Accountant, who will list the whole of the tenders received
in respect of each job on Porm A 2 and forward same immediately to
the Chief Architect for recommendation to Deputy-Commissioner on
Porm A3.
(5) Before giving his decision in regard to a tender the Deputy-
Commissioner will obtain, in writing, the applicant’s authority for ac-
ceptance of a satisfactory tender, and the applicant will also authorize
the Commission entering into the formal contract on his behalf.


(6) In all cases the lowest tender is to be accepted, provided—
(a) the tenderer is a suitable person financially, &c.;
(b) the price is sufficient to cover satisfactory completion of the
work.
(7) Where the lowest tender, after exclusion of any tender as pro-
vided in clause (6) of this G. 0., is submitted to and
declined by the applicant for any reason the Deputy Com-
missioner may, after consideration of the applicant’s repre-
sentations, call fresh tenders, hut where the applicant’s re-
fusal is not, in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner, justified the
latter may, after proper notice to the applicant, decline the tenders and
cancel the application. The Commission is opposed to an applicant
being his own contractor for any work, and where the tender submitted
by an applicant is accepted for the building of a home for which he has
been granted assistance progress payments are to be made only on the
value in excess of the difference between the tender and the estimate.
For instance, if the estimate equalled £I,OOO, applicant’s accepted tender
£BOO, and the value of the work carried out £250, for the purpose of
arriving at the value of the work carried out in connection with the ap-
plication for progress payments the £2OO would he totally disregarded
and £SO regarded as the actual value of the work performed to that date.
A similar procedure will be followed where any tender is considerably
less than the estimated amount for which the building can he erected.
(8) Form A 3, with the Deputy Commissioner’s decision, will then
be forwarded to the Accountant for action regarding any moneys re-
ceived and fencing notations. If a deposit has been lodged in respect
of an accepted tender the amount so received will be dealt with as laid
down in Accountancy Instructions, and an appropriate notation made
on the file and the Form A2. Where a deposit is lodged in respect of a
tender which has not been accepted the amount of deposit will be re-
turned to the tenderer and a suitable notation made on the file and
Form A2.
(9) After action has been completed by the Accountant the Form
A 3 will be forwarded to the Legal Section for the execution of the
proper security, as laid down in G.O.’s 109, 110 and 111, and then to
the Chief Architect for preparation of contract documents.
(10) Where a contractor whose tender has been accepted declines to
proceed any deposit lodged with the tender should be forfeited under
clause 26 (4) (b) of the General Conditions of Contract, and after
deduction has been made therefrom of the Commission’s expenses any
balance should be credited to the account of the particular applicant.
(See G.O. 95 (5).)
Minor Works.
84. (1) It is not necessary to advertise minor works, but in each
case at least three quotations must be obtained from persons experienced
in the work to be done.
(2) Cases falling under this G.O. will be minor additions, repairs,
sewerage, drainage and related matters.
(3) Minor works will be carried out under a minor contract, but it
may be desirable in some cases to prepare a contract similar to that used
for major works.


Contingency Sum.
85. (1) In all cases of major construction provision should be
made for a contingency sum, which shall not exceed £2O or be less than
£5.
(2) The unexpended balance of the contingency sum shall he de-
ducted in arriving at the final payment.
- Building Contracts.
86. Upon return of Form A 3 to the Chief Architect (after com-
pletion of security by the applicant) the Contracts Officer shall —
(i) Prepare (in duplicate) the contract documents which, after
being checked and initialed by the Chief Architect, will be
completed by the Deputy Commissioner.
(ii) Arrange for the successful tenderer to call and execute the
documents in the proper form, care being taken to ensure
that the agreement and all annexures thereto are signed,
and all alterations and pages of annexures initialed. The
Contracts Officer must also witness the signature of the
contractor at the time such is recorded.
(iii) Hand to contractor the duplicate copy of the contract docu-
ments, which must he returned on completion of the work.
(iv) Register the contract and drawings consecutively during the
period of each financial year. Drawings and specifications
forming part of a single contract will be each numbered with
the contract number.
(v) Note particulars of the contract in the Register provided.
(vi) Forward advice to the Accountant on Form A. 4, giving full
particulars of the contract. This form will be signed by the
Chief Architect.
(vii) Take charge of the signed contract and drawings, and return
them to the safe or strong-room (where provided) when not
in use.
(viii) Immediately a contract has been completed the specifications
and drawings should be filed in a suitable manner.
Erection of Dividing Fences.
87. (1) Where dividing fences require to he erected the Chief
Architect will, immediately action under G.O. 83 (9) has been
completed, endorse the file with the particulars of the necessary fencing
showing the boundaries to he fenced, the class, length and cost of
fencing provided in the building contract, in order that fencing notices
in accordance with the existing law may be served upon the adjoining
owners.
(2) The Contracts Officer will then take all necessary action in
connection with the preparation and service of fencing notices, after
which the file will be referred to the Accountant for action regarding
adjoining owners’ accounts (G.O. 148 (11) and (14)).
(3) At the time the notices are issued the Form A 9 will be endorsed
with full particulars. This will form the basis of action by the Con-
tracts Officer in obtaining the agreement of adjoining owners, and will


constitute a history in respect of each case should legal proceedings
become necessary. The cards will be filed in three sections, viz.:
(a) Cases where the original notices have been forwarded hut
agreement with adjoining owners is not complete;
(b) Cases where agreement with adjoining owners is complete
hut the erection of the fencing has not been finalized;
and
(c) Cases where all action has been completed.
(4) Immediately agreement is arrived at with an adjoining
owner the Chief Architect should authorize the contractor to proceed
with the erection of the fencing, advising the Supervising Officer and
the Accountant. This authority is to he noted on the card (Form
A 9) and the specification also noted.
(5) A review of the cards in the first group is to he made each
week to ensure that action is continuous, and no card will he advanced
to the second group until the contractor has been authorized to proceed
with the necessary fencing, as provided in clause (4).
(6) A review of the cards in the second group is to he made each
month, and where delay in completion appears to exist in any case
follow-up action is to be taken.
(7) The Chief Architect will be responsible for seeing that no
dividing fences are authorized until the requisite notices have been
served upon adjoining owners, and the liability for half cost definitely
accepted in proper form or paid by the adjoining owners so served.
A certificate from the Accountant will be sufficient for this latter
purpose, and is to he forwarded to the Chief Architect immediately
a cash payment is received.
(8) Provision should be made for the whole of the fencing to he
included in the building contract, but where a Deputy Commissioner
for good reason considers a departure justifiable. he may authorize
the inclusion in the building contract of only half the side and rear
fences (the applicant’s liability) providing the applicant first under-
takes in writing to lodge the contribution of the adjoining owner, on
the latter’s default, within two months of the date set down for pay-
ment together with interest at the prescribed rate. If this agreement
is not forthcoming, and the applicant requires the fence, the cost is
either to be included in the security (if a balance within the maximum
advance remains) or deposited in advance by the applicant.
(9) Where the applicant completes the undertaking referred to in
clause (8) of this G.O. before any expenditure on behalf of the adjoin-
ing owner is made the notice required by this G.O. must he despatched
and his agreement to the specification and price first obtained.
Contribution to Cost of Dividing Fences.
88. (1) Where the Commission is the owner of land and the adjoin-
ing block is proposed to he built upon by an owner (Commission or
otherwise) an amount not greater than half of the cost of the dividing
fence (providing the specification and price are first approved) will
he paid to the adjoining owner upon satisfactory completion of the
work.
(2) The amount so paid will he added to the liability of the
allotment receiving the benefit of the fence.


(3) In the case where the Commission is the owner of both blocks
no actual payment will take place, but the allotment not being built
upon will be debited with half cost by G.J.E.
Supervising Officers.
89. (1) For the purpose of carrying out the constructional pro-
gramme, each State is to be divided into districts and a Supervising
Officer appointed to control one or more such divisions.
(2) Each Supervising Officer will be responsible for the supervision
of all constructional work carried out within the particular district,
and will submit a weekly report to the Chief Architect in accordance
with Form A 5, setting out the stage of construction reached in respect
of each job under his control.
(3) Immediately following on the letting of a contract the Super-
vising Officer in whose district the dwelling-house is to he erected will
be advised on Form A 4, and copy of the plan and specification made
available for his use.
(4) When advice is received that a contractor is ready to com-
mence work under the contract the Supervising Officer should at once
arrange to meet the contractor on the site for the purpose of checking
boundaries and position of the dwelling-house and out-huildings in
accordance with the block plan, and to generally discuss with the con-
tractor the plan and specifications to ensure that the contractor is clear
on the requirements, particularly in regard to the following items:—
(a) Passing of plan and specifications by the council of the
municipality in which the dwelling-house is to be erected.
(b) Trenches and bottoms.
(c) Foundations.
( a nd) Height of floor from ground.
( e ) Ventilation under floors.
(/) Damp course.
( g ) Soakage and surface drainage of ground.
(Ji) Construction of chimneys.
(i) Generally in regard to construction in accordance with plan
and specifications.
(5) Immediately building materials have been placed on a site
the Supervising Officer will report in order that the Insurance Cover
Note may be issued.
(6) A Supervising Officer will be required to keep a close check
upon the work performed on each job within his district in order that
full particulars may be available to enable claims by contractors for
progress payments to be decided, as the amount of progress payment
to be made in any case will be based upon the information available
from the weekly reports furnished to the Chief Architect.
(7) The itinerary of inspection will be arranged by the Chief
Architect, and should be so set out that the Supervising Officer will he
enabled to inspect each timber job under his supervision at least once
every ten days, and each brick job at least once every seven days.
The interval between inspections may vary, however, according to the


stage of construction reached, and a Supervising Officer should, when
on a job, determine when he should next visit, and this information
should be given in his weekly report to the Chief Architect.
(8) (a) A Supervising Officer must arrange, in the case of brick
jobs in his district, to inspect the work whilst trenches are being dug,
and to test same as to depth, &c. The officer should also satisfy himself
as to the nature of the ground, and particularly in regard to the
foundations being of sufficient depth to carry the superstructure when
erected. Inspection should also be made whilst foundations are being
put in, and also during the construction of the walls, and prior to the
roofing stage being reached.
(b) In the case of timber houses it is desirable that the Supervising
Officer should be present when the foundation stumps or piers are being
put in to ensure that the depths, sole-plates and struts are in accordance
with the specification. If the Supervising Officer finds it impracticable
to be present at the period mentioned he must satisfy himself, by tests,
that the work has been completed satisfactorily.
(9) A Supervising Officer must closely check the progress of each
job under his control, and immediately it becomes evident that any job
cannot be completed within the time stipulated in the contract the
matter must at once be reported to the Chief Architect, together with
appropriate remarks as to the reasons which the Supervising Officer
considers are responsible for delaying the job.
(10) Immediately a Supervising Officer is satisfied that a job has
been completed in strict accordance with the plan and specification he
must report such job to the Chief Architect as being ready for final
inspection. The Supervising Officer should, if possible, also be present
at the final inspection.
(11) After the final inspection has been made and the contractor
has been paid (with exception of retention money referred to in
G.O. 93) no further inspection of the property need be made until the
expiration of the maintenance period (G.O. 93), or on complaints by
the applicant.
(12) Immediately prior to the expiration of the maintenance
period (G.O. 93), a further inspection by the Supervising Officer or
Chief Architect must be made, and any items requiring attention listed
and action taken to recall the contractor to the job for the purpose
of completing the necessary work.
(13) When the contractor reports that the work referred to in
clause (12) has been completed a further inspection is to be made
and a report- as to whether the job has been satisfactorily completed
or not furnished to the Chief Architect.
(14) In addition to supervising the construction of new houses
being erected within his district a Supervising Officer will be required
to supervise the carrying out of any repairs to dwelling houses, and
to furnish such reports as are necessary in regard thereto.
(15) A Supervising Officer will also carry out inspections, and
furnish such reports as may be desired in connexion with the
insurance of the Commission’s houses. The A.O.R. (Form I. 1) will
be completed at the time of final inspection.


(16) In no case is the plan or specification to be departed from
without the approval of the Chief Architect. If the Chief Architect
authorizes a variation he must acquaint the Supervising Officer con-
cerned without delay.
Progress and Final Payments.
90. (1) Progress payments to contractors may be made up to 75 per
cent, of the value of the work executed before the roofing is completed.
(2) After completion of the roofing the amount of progress pay-
ment may he increased to a sum not exceeding 90 per cent, of the value
of the work executed.
(3) "When the final inspection is effected and there are no out-
standing items the progress payment may be increased to the full
amount of the contract less at least £ls, or such higher sum as a
Deputy Commissioner directs, to be held as retention money in con-
formity with G.O. 93.
(4) Where the contractor reports that the work is completed and
the usual final inspection discloses that items are outstanding then
the progress payment may not exceed 90 per cent, of the value of the
work completed until a subsequent inspection discloses that the work
has been completed satisfactorily.
(5) Where a deposit, either preliminary or final, or both, is required
and lodged as security for the proper completion of a particular work
a Deputy Commissioner may, if he thinks such a course desirable,
retain the deposit as well as a maintenance sum of at least £ls and not
pay the same to the contractor until the time when he is discharged
from the contract.
(6) Claims for progress payments should he made on Form Ac 9
and supported by a certificate from the Supervising Officer on Form A5.
Upon receipt of the Form A 5 the Chief Architect shall, after
satisfying himself that it is correct and the work has been satisfactorily
performed, certify accordingly and forward it to the Accounts Section
for attention.
(7) Claims (on Form AclO) for final progress payments will be
similarly dealt with except that such will always he less the main-
tenance sum, and if a Deputy Commissioner so decides part or whole
of the deposit as well. To enable a final payment to he made the Chief
Architect must endorse his certificate on the respective Form A6,
and forward this, together with a statement regarding extras and
deductions, and a recommendation in respect of liquidated damages, to
the Accountant.
Extras and Deductions.
91. The applicant must agree, in writing, to all deductions and
extras to the contract, and the contractor shall not be permitted to
deduct or add any items in respect of the contract unless authorized
in writing by the Chief Architect to do so.
Prime Cost Items.
92. (1) The selection of prime cost items may be made by the
applicant, in which case each article will he subject to the approval
of the Chief Architect, hut it will save delay if the applicant agrees
to the Commission acting for him after he has made known his
wishes.


(2) Any variation in tlie description, class, or price of any of the
prime cost items must he agreed to, in writing, by both the applicant
and the contractor, and any increase over the amount allowed must
be paid by the applicant or added to the advance where such will not
bring the total beyond £BOO.
Maintenance Period.
93. (1) The maintenance period commences from the time of the
final inspection by the Chief Architect or Supervising Officer if there
are no outstanding items. If there are outstanding items, then the
maintenance period commences from the inspection made following
advice that these items have been completed. The time of the main-
tenance period shall be thirteen weeks as provided in clause 36 of the
General Conditions of Contract.
(2) The amount of maintenance money to be retained in any
case shall not be less than £ls. (see G.O. 90), and shall not be paid
until —
(a) the final certificate has been issued and the maintenance
period has expired; and
(b) full deduction therefrom has been made for any works carried
out by the Commission in consequence of faults reported or
discovered during the maintenance period.
(3) The Supervising Officer or Chief Architect will inspect all
dwelling-houses immediately prior to the expiration of the maintenance
period, and, unless satisfactory, report to the Deputy Commissioner as
to the manner in which the work has been carried out, and whether
such is in accordance with the plan and specifications.
(4) Where defects exist or repairs are necessary the Chief Architect
is to recall the contractor to the job and arrange for the items mentioned
to be given proper attention, but in major matters this action will be
taken on the instruction of the Deputy Commissioner.
(5) The Commission should not carry out repairs or other works
during the maintenance period unless the contractor definitely declines,
in writing, to do so, or does not, after proper notice in writing, take
satisfactory steps to carry out the demands made. If either of these
positions arises then the Deputy Commissioner will after inviting the
contractor in the manner prescribed in the General Conditions of
Contract make good the items in question and deduct the cost thereof
from the deposit or other money available under the contract.
(6) Where the work has been satisfactorily carried out in
accordance with the plan and specification the Deputy Commissioner
will minute the report to the Accountant to make available to the
contractor retention money held. That action will not be taken in
any instance until the maintenance period has definitely expired.
Handing over Keys and Obtaining Certificate of Satisfaction.
94. (1) Immediately the dwelling-house is available for occupation
the applicant is to be advised and his receipt obtained for the keys.
At the same time he must be required to give a Certificate of Satis-
faction in the approved form, and, unless an applicant is raising an
unreasonable objection, or an unnecessary delay will result, the final
progress payment should not be made until this statement is received.
(See also G.O. 90.)


(2) To ensure that an applicant when entering into occupation
of a dwelling-house is in possession of a repayments hook the Chief
Architect is to notify the Accountant of the proposed date of occupa-
tion by the applicant, so that such book may be issued simultaneously
with the keys of the dwelling.
Contracts.
(a) Not Commenced within Stipulated Period.
95. (1) Where a contract is not commenced within a reasonable
time after completion of the contract documents the Chief Architect will
report the matter, together with particulars of special circumstances
(if any) to the Deputy Commissioner, who may, within his discretion
cancel the contract in accordance with clause 31 of the General Condi-
tions of Contract.
(2) Where a contractor fails to proceed with the work of a contract
at a rate or in a manner satisfactory to a Deputy Commissioner, action
in accordance with clause 30 of the General Conditions of Contract
should be taken.
( b ) Not Completed within Specified Time.
(3) Where a contract has not been completed within the time
stipulated in the agreement the Chief Architect will report the matter
to the Deputy Commissioner for decision as to payment by the con-
tractor for damages by institution of a penalty as provided in clause
34 of the General Conditions of Contract.
(4) If the Deputy Commissioner is of opinion that the circum-
stances of the case warrant enforcement of the powers conferred by
clause 34 of the General Conditions of Contract formal notice of
intention to enforce the terms of clause 34 should at once be served
upon the contractor.
(5) The amount of the penalty enforced under clause 34 of
the General Conditions of Contract, or, under heading (a), pursuant
to General Conditions of Contract, clause 26 (4) ( b ), including any
deposit forfeited by contractor as a result of the cancellation by the
Commission of his building contract, shall be credited to the account of
the applicant concerned, less any sums due to the Commission. Any
amount so credited, however, will not atfect the amount stated in the
security document, hut will be credited to the applicant’s account in
reduction of the amount for which security has been taken.
(c) Repudiated by Refusal of Contractor to Complete.
(6) Before arrangements are made for any work to he carried out
owing to default of the original contractor the Senior Conveyancer must
certify on the file that the whole cost to complete the home, plus any
necessary expenses not payable in cash, is covered by security properly
executed by the applicant. The Commission uses its best endeavours
on behalf of applicants, but cannot hold itself responsible for the
default of a contractor.
Periodical Inspection of Homes.
96. (1) All homes provided by the Commission are to be inspected
to ensure that the applicants are keeping the properties in good and
tenantahle repair, and that generally the provisions of Section 31 of
the Act are being complied with.


(2) Particulars for the information of the person who is to make
the inspection are to he entered on Form A 8 by the Insurance Officer
from information endorsed on the insurance locality card. The result
and the date of the inspection must also he entered on the insurance
locality card for future information.
(3) In country centres in those States where an arrangement has
been entered into with country Architects the necessary inspections will
be carried out by the Architect appointed in each country district.
(4) In the metropolitan area arrangements will be made for Super-
vising Officers to inspect the dwelling-houses provided in their district
as occasion permits. This will obviate the necessity for special inspec-
tions being made.
(5) Each property inspected will he reported upon on Form AB,
which will be forwarded to the Chief Architect by the Supervising
Officer carrying out the inspection.
(6) Upon receipt by the Chief Architect of the Form A 8 he will
decide what action, if any, is required. Where it is evident that the
property reported upon is in need of repair the Form should be passed
by the Chief Architect to the Legal Section for the issue of the neces-
sary notice under Section 31 (2) of the Act.
(7) Failing satisfactory action being taken by the applicant after
despatch of the notice referred to in the preceding paragraph the
matter should he referred to the Deputy Commissioner.
(8) When other action has been completed the Form A 8 must be
passed to the Insurance Section for any necessary amendment to the
insurance cover and entry upon insurance locality card.
(9) A periodical inspection should be carried out at not less
than three-yearly intervals in the case of wooden houses, and not less
than five-yearly intervals in the case of other houses. Where an
applicant’s account is up to date and little arrears have accrued in the
past it may be assumed that the applicant is shouldering his obligations
and the period in the foregoing extended, providing the insurance is
sufficient.
Amount of Insurance.
97. G.O. 204 provides the method of arriving at the sum for which
a property must he insured. This G.O. must be closely observed by
officers in completing an A.O.ft.
Australian Materials.
98. (1) The policy of the Commission is to give preference to goods
of Australian manufacture, next British and then goods manufactured
by countries allied with Great Britain during the war. This is also the
policy of the Commonwealth Government.
(2) A different position arises, however, where the person ordering
the construction is not the Commission hut the applicant. Where the
specification is left to the discretion of the Commission subject to the
formal approval by the applicant, Australian goods will invariably be
specified, except where certain classes of articles are used for special
reasons, such as Oregon studs and laths, redwood for joinery, &c., in
timber homes.
1009.—3


(3) The price will naturally govern the supply of the article, and
assuming satisfactory goods of equal utility were available and the
price-for the imported was much less than that produced in Australia,
then the Commission would be failing in its duty to the applicant if
it specified other than the imported article. Assuming that the price
of the article produced in Australia was much less than that of the
imported the Commission would specify the Australian-made article,
and if the applicant desired the imported article he could only arrange
for its provision by lodging in cash the difference between the price of
the Australian-made article and that of the imported one.
(4) Whilst the Commission has a controlling influence in this way
it must not be overlooked that the applicant is paying for the home,
and it cannot force an applicant to use a local article at an enhanced
price when a similar article imported into Australia is available at
lesser cost. The Commission has a controlling influence-based on —
(a) the suitability of the article for the purpose required;
(b) its utility at the price proposed to be paid.
This influence can always be removed by the applicant, who has the
final authority, and he can arrange for his requirements to be carried
out by paying the extra cost of the imported article over the Aus-
tralian. Whilst the Commission has the influence as mentioned, it is
not proposed to use this except as referred to above.
Type Specification.
v
99. (1) The type specification introduced in New South Wales and
Queensland will be used with suitable variations applicable to the
particular work.
(2) Architects acting for the Commission throughout country areas
should furnish the requirements of the authorities in charge of the
several utility services so that specifications for country works can be
altered to accord with the regulations in force in each town.
(3) The Architects should also supply from time to time a price-
list of the materials in each town in their respective districts and full
advice regarding the class of construction favoured. For instance, _ in
certain parts of Queensland cypress pine is used for stumps, whilst
in other parts only bloodwood or ironbark is used. In different parts of
New South Wales cypress pine, murray pine, &c., are used to nullify
the attacks of white ants.
(4) Where applicants require a material or an article which, it is
thought, will not give satisfactory service, then such is not to be used.
(5) Where sewerage is not available the fittings, &c., should be in
accordance with the regulations of the authority, so that when the
sewerage is extended the only expense will be that of connecting to the
main sewer.
(6) The use of roughcast on laths externally is prohibited and it
may only be used as under: —
(a) On walls of brick or similar material.
(b) Above top plate on expanded metal.


dhjfdkdfdkjdfkjd
(7) Fibro cement sheets and similar material may not be used
externally except above top plate level'. Internally this material as
well as fibrous plaster sheets may not be used within 4 feet from the
floor - .
(8) Tuckpointing A should not be permitted except in special cir-
cumstances, and then only with the approval of the Deputy Commis-
sioner, unless the applicant deposits the cost in cash.
(9) The specification may provide for one stove, either gas, one-
fire or oil, but there is nothing to prevent an applicant from arranging
for the supply of a second stove privately. In parts of Queensland
and Hew South Wales where high temperatures are recorded, and where
at the present time one-fire stoves are generally used, the applicant
should be advised of the benefits arising from the use of the oil stove
and such obtained if he makes this choice.
Plans and Municipal Councils.
100. (1) All plans and specifications, which will be prepared in
accordance with municipal by-laws and regulations, must be submitted
to the municipal council concerned, and its approval obtained in the
proper form by the contractor before the work may be commenced.
(2) Any amendments required by the council are to be carried out,
but if these are considered unreasonable in any way then the case
should be forwarded to C.A. for advice.
Motor Transport.
101. (1) Motor transport is provided for Supervising Officers and
Architects, and this must only be used for official business. Definite
action will be taken against any officer who uses a cycle or car other-
wise.
(2) Running records must be kept by each officer on the prescribed
forms and submitted weekly, when they will be dissected to ascertain
whether each unit is being economically used. Full instructions in this
regard have been issued separately.
Building Record.
102. (1) Upon receipt of a file containing approval for construc-
tional work to be carried out, a card in the approved form will be suit-
ably noted so that the progress of the case may be followed.
(2) The card drawer will be divided into compartments to agree
with the different stages of the work, such as —
(a) Building cases approved.
( b ) Plans prepared tenders not called.
(c) Tenders called not finally dealt with,
and so on.
(3) Every endeavour is to be made to ensure that each case will
proceed in the order of its priority.
PART 4.—CONVEYANCING SECTION.
Applications where Eligibility has been Determined.
103. (1) Applications, excepting those for a dwelling erected or to
be erected on group land owned by the Commission, after determination
of eligibility, payment of fees by applicants (G.O. 54), completion of
valuation, survey, and if necessary, site report, will be forwarded by


the General Section to the Legal Section. On receipt hy the Legal
Section the usual Titles Office searches must he made in respect of the
title to the land referred to in each application.
# (2) Where the title is found to contain a defect which, after suitable
steps have been taken, cannot be remedied, particulars will be noted on
the file and submitted to the Deputy Commissioner for action in accord-
ance with G.O. 53.
(3) Where the title is clear the fact will be recorded and the file for-
warded to the General Section for action in regard to survey (G.O. 50).
Applications Approved by the Deputy Commissioner.
104. A final search must be made immediately before settlement in
respect of each application, and if a mortgage or other encumbrance is
existent the applicant will be notified that it must be removed before
the application can be proceeded with. If the encumbrance cannot be
removed, this fact is to be noted on the file and same submitted to the
Deputy Commissioner for action, as laid down in G.O. 53. Where an
encumbrance has been satisfactorily removed, or where the title is
perfectly clear, the application will be dealt with as shown under each
respective heading.
Nature of Security.
105. (1) Where the applicant has not a 10 per cent, equity in the
proposal, as explained in Section 21, then the nature of the security will
be the approved contract of sale, the title to be in the name of the
Commission.
(2) Where the applicant has a 10 per cent, equity in the proposal, as
explained in Section 21, then the nature of the security shall be a mort-
gage in the approved form. If, however, an applicant with a 10 per
cent, equity requests the security to be by way of contract of sale, there
is no objection to such a course.
Amount of Security.
106. The_ amount for which security will be taken will be obtained
from the Form A 3 in cases of construction, and where a property is
acquired or is transferred or resold from the approval by the Deputy
Commissioner, but shall not exceed the purchase price or sale price less
the required contribution by the applicant.
Purpose of Loans,
107. (1) Loans may be granted to an eligible person under either
rent purchase system or advance on. mortgage system, for the following
purposes: —
( a ) to erect a dwelling-house on land owned by him;
( b ) to purchase land and erect thereon a dwelling-house;
(c) to purchase a dwelling-house, together with the land on
which it is erected;
. ( a nd) to complete a partially erected dwelling-house owned by
him;
(e) to enlarge a dwelling-house owned by him; or
(/) to discharge any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance already
existing on his holding.


(2) G.O.’s 108, 109, 110, 111 show how each case is to be handled
and what documents are to be prepared, but it may so happen that
proposals shown as contract of sale cases or mortgage cases may come
within the alternative category, and whilst the G.O.’s have been de-
signed to cover the majority of cases each case should he considered
in conjunction with G.O. 105, which determines (having regard to
the interest of the applicant) whether the case will come under the rent
purchase system or the advance on mortgage system.
Settlement Sheet.
108. (1) After execution the mortgage or contract of sale will be
indexed in the Security Register and a settlement sheet in the approved
form (L3l) completed and signed by the Settlement Officer.
(2) The L3l will then be attached to the file and passed with
the security document to the Accountant for checking and the opening
of the personal loan account as provided in G.O. 147.

Titles Office and subsequently collected therefrom and placed in the
strongroom for safe custody and action completed as provided in
G.O. 128. *
(4) The necessary fees in connexion with registrations, &c., will be
obtained from the Legal Section sub-advance. (See G.O. 149 (5) .)

Application by a Purchaser under a Contract of Sale for a Transfer
and Mortgage.
112. On receipt of the file from the General Section showing the
Peputy Commissioner’s approval of the application in accordance with
the provisions of sub-section (6) of Section 19 of the Act, a transfer to
the applicant and mortgage to the Commissioner will be prepared for
signature. Subsequent action as to registration of documents, &c., will
be taken as in G.O. 108, the file, however, after notation, being returned
to the General Section.
Definition of Mortgage, Charge, or Encumbrance.
113. (1) A Mortgage is a dealing registered in the Titles Office.
(2) A Charge may be an unregistered mortgage, equitable
mortgage, deed of deposit or escrow or such other bona fide document
which in effect specifically charges the land in question. Further, a


Charge may refer to rates and taxes or a liability of the owner with
regard to fencing or sewerage in which cases no prepared document may
exist.
(3) An Encumbrance has a similar meaning to Charge.
Repayment of Loans.
114. (1) Upon receipt of all moneys owing by an applicant under a
contract of sale or mortgage, the Accountant will endorse the file accord-
ingly and forward same to the Legal Section for preparation of transfer
to the purchaser or owner, or discharge of mortgage, as the case may he.
(2) At the settlement the necessary fees, &c., will first be collected,
and certificates requested showing that no charges for rates, road-
making, kerbing and guttering, footpaths or sewerage are owing, after
which the transfer or discharge of mortgage will he duly executed. A
notation to this effect will be made on the file by the Senior Convey-
ancer, and the documents registered at the Titles Office and subse-
quently collected therefrom.
(3) After action in clause (2) hereof has been taken the title
documents will be handed to the purchaser or owner, and a receipt there-
for obtained in the Security Register. Uo title or other document will
be handed to any solicitor, agent, or other person without the written
direction of the applicant.
(4) Care must be exercised to ensure that at the settlement the
purchaser or owner thoroughly understands that the insurance of the
property thereupon lapses.
Country Settlements.
115. (1) After a country application has been approved and is
ready for settlement the proper requisitions on title will be made to
the vendor.
(2) Whilst requisitions are being satisfied by the vendor all neces-
sary documents will be prepared and forwarded to the applicant with
instructions as to his execution and the witnessing thereof, and the
returning of the documents to the Commission, the applicant being
informed of the amount of necessary fees, &c., and deposit (if any), and
such, must be forwarded with the documents duly executed. The
applicant is to be informed that the submission of the documents for
his signature is without prejudice to the Commission’s position in the
event of requisitions not being satisfactorily disposed of by the vendor.
(3) Subject to requisitions on title being disposed of satisfactorily
by the vendor the necessary documents will then be forwarded to him
(or his solicitor or agent) with instructions .as to his execution and the •
witnessing thereof, and with, a request that the vendor’s title should
be forwarded to the Commission with the documents duly executed, an
undertaking being given in the communication to the vendor that the
Commission will hold the title on his behalf, pending settlement, when
a cheque for the correct amount (adjustment of rates having been first
made by the Commission) will be forwarded.
(4) The vendor is to be informed that he may, at his own expense,
name an agent in the capital city of the State concerned, to whom
he will forward the title and documents, duly executed, for settlement
at the Commission’s offices.


(5) Costs for agency or other items may not be incurred, and the
Commission will not be liable for any such charges.
(6) Money under a contract of sale or mortgage will not be passed
until requisitions have been met, rates adjusted, and fees and documents
of title (in order) are received, together with the vendor’s authority as
to payment.
(7) When settlement is to he made in a capital city with a hank
or other agent such will be completed in the usual manner.
Legal Advice.
116. A Deputy Commissioner may, where legal advice is required on
matters local in their incidence, consult the Deputy Crown Solicitor or
the representative of the Crown Solicitor, as the case may be. He sha
refer all cases involving the interpretation of the Act or Regulations
or matters which also affect or apply to other States to C.A.
Restriction on Purchase of Land.
117. A Deputy Commissioner is not authorized to purchase any land
unless an application has been received for the purchase of that land
and the erection of a dwelling-house. In all other cases of suggested
purchase the proposal must first be submitted to the Minister ana his
approval obtained. (Section 16a.)
Transfers between Applicants.
118. (1) The nature of security to he given by the transferror will
depend upon his equity in the proposal as set out in G.O. 105. The
basis of arriving at the transfer price is covered by G.O. 71.
(2) At settlement the transferror must pay all fees in cash, and the
procedure will be similar to that laid down in the purchase of an
existing dwelling-house.
(3) In contract of sale cases the transferror will he required to
execute a release in the approved form, and in mortgage cases a
transfer, either to the Commission, where the transferee is purchasing
under a contract of sale, or to the transferee, where the latter gives a
mortgage, under the conditions laid down.
Purchase of Equities.
119. (1) Where it is decided to purchase an applicant’s equity
under Section 29a, the amount will be arrived at in accordance with
G.O. 72.
(2) The applicant at the time the equity is paid to him will be
required to execute a release in contract of sale cases (Form L 34),
and a transfer to the Commission in mortgage cases, but where there is
a purchaser immediately available this transfer should be to him by
direction of the Commission, provided the new applicant has at least
a 10 per cent, equity in the proposal, when, in accordance with the Act,
he may give a mortgage to secure the amount advanced.
(3) Rates will be adjusted with the original applicant, but no allow-
ance can be made in respect of insurance. There is no objection to the
old and new applicant adjusting the insurance between themselves
where the new applicant is available at the time of the transaction.


(4) The old applicant will not be charged any fees for the prepara-
tion of the necessary documents, but these will be raised and debited to
the liability in respect of the property. Where the new applicant
executes a contract of sale he will be charged the proper fee for the
preparation of such document, and where he gives a mortgage he will
be charged the fee for the transfer and also the preparation of the
mortgage.
Resales.
120. (1) The action to be taken in such cases will be similar to
that in transfer cases, and the form of security to be executed will be
governed by G.O. 105.
(2) Care must be exercised to ensure that the previous contract
of sale is properly cancelled and instalments forfeited.
(3) The payment of rates due by the old applicant will be governed
by G.O. 78 and no allowance will be made to the old applicant in
respect of insurance.
Sales to Civilians.
121. (1) The action to he followed in such cases is similar to that
in resale cases.
(2) The terms * for sales to civilians are set out in G.O. 75.
All sales under this G.O. will be by way of the approved contract of
sale.
Sales under Section 36.
122. (1) In all these cases the property will have been mortgaged
to the Commission, and it is most important that the provisions of
Section 36 should be closely followed in giving at least 14 days notice
of the proposed sale, terms, &c., to the old applicant.
(2) Where it is desirable to bind the person purchasing the
property a form of contract can be entered into which will become
absolute upon the Commission being in a position to sell. This position
will anive when the old applicant does not take any definite steps
within the period allotted in the notice of sale given to him.
Tenancies.
123. (1) Where a tenant is obtained for a property pending its
disposal the rental should be fixed inclusive of rates, which will then he
paid by the Commission.
(2) The tenancy should be on a weekly or monthly basis, and Form
L 6 will be used.
Additional Advances.
124. (1) It may happen that where a case is on the mortgage
system and an extra advance is approved that such will reduce the
applicant’s interest in the proposal below 10 per cent (see Section
21) and it will he necessary then to bring the case under the rent
purchase system. For instance, assuming the applicant had been
made an advance of £BOO on a property costing or valued
at £BB9 and had lodged £B9, giving a mortgage to secure the
amount advanced, and that an extra advance of £IOO for any purpose
was later made available, then unless he had repaid at least £lO on
account of principal the security to cover the first advance and the
second advance of £IOO would be a contract of sale.


(2) In cases falling within the advance on mortgage system an
additional advance will he secured by a second mortgage, which will
he duly registered.
(3) In contract of sale cases Form LI2 will he prepared and
executed. It will not he necessary to prepare a contract of sale cover-
ing the amount outstanding under the old contract of sale plus the
additional advance unless for some reason such is considered essen-
tial.
(4) Where an applicant applies for an additional advance to cover
roadmaking cost and supplies an estimate as notified by the council
and an additional advance is approved, then he should he advised in
writing that the Commission will make available the amount approved
or the cost, whichever is the lesser, upon his submitting the account
from the council when the work is completed and then entering into
the required form of security.
(5) In cases where an advance is made to cover the installation
of sewerage the necessary security will he taken when the tender is
received or, where the applicant has the work done himself, when the
actual cost is known and the certificate of the proper authority ob-
tained as to the satisfactory completion of the work.
Sewerage Installation —Guarantee by Commission.
125. (1) In G.O. 67 is set out the action to be followed in
dealing with such applications, hut where it is decided to guarantee
the account, then the application to the controlling authority will be
endorsed in contract of sale cases “ Countersigned as to deferred pay-
ments ” and signed by the Deputy Commissioner.
(2) In mortgage cases a similar procedure will he followed except
that the words to be set out on the application will be: -
« The War Service Homes Commissioner hereby, guarantees that
in the event of his entering into possession of the subject
premises as mortgagee or selling same as provided in the
War Service Homes Act he will ensure that any balance then
owing by the withinnamed to the Board is duly
paid to it and that if necessary he will bear the payment
thereof.”
When such an endorsement has been made the application will he
forwarded to the controlling authority and the satisfactory completion
of the work will he a matter between the applicant and the controlling
authority.
(3) The effect of countersigning is that in the event of the applicant
defaulting in his payments to the controlling authority the Commission
would be required to act under the guarantee, take up the payments,
and recover from the applicant in due course.
(4) Where in such a case the property reverts to the Commission
the total liability for sewerage will be discharged, or debited to the
applicant’s account and liability in respect of the property, or if an
applicant is available to purchase the property and desires to take
over the payments to the controlling authority he may do so, provided
he acknowledges the fact in writing on the file. Such a proposal
would necessarily require the approval of the controlling authority.


(5) Before payment of any sewerage instalment is made the appli-
cant should be pressed to meet his obligations, and if he does not do
so then the payment should be made and recovered from the applicant.
Application of Section 18A.
126. (1) Where approval is given for expenditure under this
Section in respect of any applicant then he should be communicated
with and requested to execute an acknowledgment of liability to he set
out in Form Ll 2 suitably adapted where such is necessary.
(2) Where Form LI2 is completed,. or where the applicant does
not complete it within a reasonable period, the particular work may
he proceeded with, and when the cost is known, which will include fees
and charges and progress interest, such will he allocated to each appli-
cant, and Form L2B despatched.
(3) Where action is taken under section 18a with the consent of
the applicant he should be requested to pay all fees and charges in
cash and before the work is commenced or a liability for, say, road-
making discharged he must execute Form Ll 2 (acknowledgment), and
Form L2B will be despatched when the cost is known and the instal-
ment and commencing date thereof determined.
Filing of Securities.
127. In G.O. 108 it is provided that particulars of each security
completed must be suitably entered in the Security Register, and G.O.
147 sets out that the file and security documents must be forwarded
to the Accountant for opening of the personal loan card of
the particular applicant, and until the security has been passed by
this officer no expenditure, except in the nature of fees previously
lodged by the applicant, may be incurred. If it is found that the
advance is in excess of the security, the Accountant must promptly refer
the matter specially to the Deputy Commissioner, advice being sent to
this office without delay. Any other queries should be referred to the
Chief Clerk.
Checking of Securities.
128. (1) The Audit Department has arranged for its Inspector
to then check the documents with the personal loan card,
after which the securities will be returned to the Legal Section for
registration, entry in the Security Register, &c. They will then be
placed in a security packet, which will be numbered consecutively
from ISTo. 1 and endorsed with the following particulars in the manner
provided:—
Name
Amount £ : :
J. No
Contract of Sale
Mortgage
Old System Title
Certificate of Title.


(2) The office action in connexion with the security having been
completed the packet (unsealed) will be submitted to the Audit Inspec-
tor, together with the file, who will satisfy himself as to the contents of
the packet, affix it with gum, attach wax, and impress his seal (in the
presence of the Commission’s officer, and also check off with the entry in
the Security Register). The officer whose duty it is to operate the
strong room will receive the packet from the Audit Inspector, endorse
the file, and place it in the strong room or safe. Should the Audit
Inspector not he immediately available, the securities, together with
the file, must be placed and retained in the strong room until that
officer is in a position to deal with them.
* - i
Securities Required by Officers.
129. (1) Where packets are subsequently required by an officer
they must not he supplied by the custodian of securities unless —
(a) A requisition in writing is received stating the reasons
therefor,
(b) The custodian is satisfied the security is necessary in con-
nexion with the action being taken by the officer submit-
ting the request;
N.B. —Where the custodian is not satisfied, the requisi-
tion shall be referred to the Senior Conveyancer.
(c) If the requisition is complied with the officer must endorse
thereon that he has received the documents made avail-
able, and until their return the requisition is to be placed
m the broken packet and retained in the strong room.
( a nd) When the documents are returned they shall be checked
with the requisition, which will be receipted and with the
old packet passed to the Audit Inspector. The Audit
Inspector will initial the receipt, place the documents in
another packet, which will be sealed, as set out in G.O.
128 (2), the requisition then being placed on the file
and the old security packet destroyed.
(2) It is desired to restrict the supply of securities from the
strong room to officers to cases where the security documents are abso-
lutely essential. Where the Crown Solicitor or his representative is
instructed to take action in any case it should be arranged that tlie
security document will be made available later, on special request by
the Crown Solicitor. As practically 95 per cent, of actions instituted
are compromised before reaching the court, this procedure will obviate
the supply of the security in quite a number of cases.
(3) The custodian of securities must review requisitions where
the securities have not been returned within a reasonable period and
bring to the notice of the Senior Conveyancer any case where it is con-
sidered the security should he returned or has been outstanding an
unreasonable time.


Annual Check of Securities.
130. (1) Once each year, at the time chosen by the Audit Inspector,
and in his presence, the following procedure is to be carried out: —
Broken Packets.
Check the requisitions and require the production of the docu-
ments by the officer to whom they have been supplied. This
does not apply where the documents have been supplied to the
Crown Solicitor or the solicitor representing him in any
State; in these cases the acknowledgment of the Crown Solici-
tor or his representative is to be reviewed.
Intact Packets.
To ensure that no packet has been manipulated closely examine
each externally, opening any with suspicious marking or
wffiich do not appear to be in order in every way, checking
the contents with the Security Register. In addition, at
least one in every 100 packets, as determined by the Audit
Inspector, will be opened and the contents checked with the
Security Register.
(2) Any packets opened during this inspection will be sealed as
provided in G.O. 128 (2).
Reinstatement of Contract of Sale.
131. (1) Where a contract is cancelled in accordance with the
power contained in the Act, and it is subsequently desired to give
possession to the former applicant and re-establish the contract, then
before giving possession the following endorsement is to be made on the
contract and executed by the applicant and the Commission:—
“ In consideration of payment of sum of £ representing
instalments and expenses due under the within contract of
sale, the said contract of sale is hereby reinstated and is
to have the same force and effect as if the cancellation by the
Commission referred to in the Notice of Cancellation
dated had not occurred.”
(2) The notice on the file which cancelled the contract is to be
suitably endorsed.
PART S.—ACCOUNTS SECTION.
Responsibility of the Accountant.
132. (1) The branch Accountant is wholly responsible for the finan-
cial portion of the Commission’s operations, and it is his duty to submit
figures on which the estimates are prepared and requisitions for funds
are forwarded to C.A. from time to time.
(2) He must not pass or authorize expenditure which has not been
approved by the proper officer and within that officer’s authority. To
illustrate the position of Accountant, assuming an officer directed action
by the Accountant which the G.O.’s show to be contrary to what is
provided or in excess of that officer’s authority, then the Accountant may
not comply with that direction. He should, however, point out fully
the circumstances, if necessary, and report the matter in writing to the
Deputy Commissioner for submission to C.A.


(3) It is not suggested that an officer would act in excess of his
powers or contrary to the G.O.’s, and the comment in clause (2) is

the cash book being regarded as the cash book for the purpose of
this system.

entry will be completed in the first case by crediting the asset, profit,
loss, or expense account concerned, and in the case of the latter by
debiting the asset, liability, profit, loss or expense account therewith
associated.
(3) In addition to the cash book and appropriation ledger, the
only other source of particulars for the general ledger is the general
journal, and this will record such transactions as —
(a) Transfers in and between “construction,”
“ personal loan,” “ House property not disposed
of,” “ profit and loss accounts,” &c.
(h) Raising of Interest debits.
(c) Raising of debits for architects and supervision
charges, &c.

comprises two classes —
(a) Single allotments not in a group; and
( b ) Group land.

that any allotment will revert to the Commission. In these cases a Form
Ac 6 will have been opened in the name of the intending applicant,
as provided in G.O. 148, and, as it is desirable to retain in the Works
in Progress section a record of the applicant’s transactions, when the
block reverts to the Commission a G.J.E. is to be passed debiting Land
Hot Utilized and crediting Works in Progress. Particulars of the
land will be entered in the top of the Eorm Ac 6 opened in the Land
Hot Utilized section from the purchase contract under the number
of the allotment in the registered plan, whilst the number of the
G.J.E. transferring the debit from Works in Progress to Land Hot
Utilized will be entered in both accounts as a cross reference. Brief
particulars of the reasons for the transfer will be shown in the Form
Ac 6in the Works in Progress , section.
(3) Group land is to be recorded on Forms Ac 7 and Ac 6 as set
out in the following paragraphs:—
(a) The Group Sheet (Form Ac 7) is to be opened from the
purchase contract, and all the available .information
entered immediately. As information such as “ Sub-
divisional Plan Approved ” and “Development Costs”
are ascertained at a later date, these will be inserted
immediately they are known.


(b) Expenditure for the purchase of the Group will be debited
from Treasury Form 20 to the Group Sheet, and these
will be the subsidiary record to the Land Not Utilized
account in the general ledger. This Group Sheet will
record all transactions until the blocks are priced ready
for selection.
(c) When reserves are raised, particulars are to he entered in
the Amount Reserved column, opposite the relative
item at the top of the Group Sheet, and at this time
this particular part of the Group Sheet will be the sub-
sidiary record to a general ledger account which is to be
opened and styled “ Group Development Costs.” The
debits to this general ledger account which, as set out
above will be supported by the particulars at the top of
the Group Sheet, will be raised by a G.J.E. crediting
Reserve for Group Development, a separate Reserve
account and Group Development Costs account are to he
raised for each group.
( a nd) Expenditure for development covered by the reserves will be
debited to Land Not Utilized, and, consequently, in the
Group Sheet, and added to the capital cost, and at the
end of each month a G.J.E. is to he passed debiting the
Reserve account in the general ledger, and credit-
ing Group Development Costs, whilst the expen-
diture for the various classes of development will be
entered in pencil at the top of the Group Sheet. The
column ' Reserve Unexpended at the top of the Group
Sheet need be completed then only at the balancing
periods, but the difference between the columns for
Amount Reserved and the Expenditure will agree
with the amount shown as Reserve for Group Develop-
ment and Group Development Costs for that particular
group in the general ledger.
(e) Immediately the blocks are priced ready for selection, single
allotment cards (Eorm Ac 6) are to be opened for each
allotment, and the price shown will cover all the develop-
ment costs whether they are expended or not. In order
then that the single allotment accounts will agree with the
Group Sheet, it will be necessary to debit the Expendi-
ture and Progressive Capital Cost colulnns on the
Group Sheet with the Unexpended Reserves, and
this will result from a G.J.E. debiting Land
Not Utilized, and crediting Group Development Costs,
closing the latter account in the general ledger. The differ-
ence between the Amount Reserved and the Expenditure
at the head of the Group Sheet will still agree with the
balance in the Reserve account. Subsequently, expendi-
ture on development will be debited to the Reserve account
and noted at the top of the Group Sheet, in pencil as
previously. To facilitate this a running journal entry,
entered from the Form Ac 44, is to be maintained
throughout the month. When the development is com-
pleted, the balance at the top of the Group Sheet will


correspond with the reserves not required, as per the
Reserve account in the general ledger, and will be
written hack by a credit entry to the Group Sheet through
Land Hot Utilized by debiting the Reserve account by a
G.J.E. Particulars of these credits will, however, he first
submitted to C.A. in accordance with G.O. 194 (4) for
direction of any variation to this procedure.
(/) Interest will be calculated on the Group Sheet until the single
allotment cards are opened, when it will be calculated on
the single allotment accounts and a summary made for
entry on the Group Sheet at the end of each month.
( g ) Immediately a block is allotted or otherwise disposed of,
the particulars are to be entered in the Group Sheet show-
ing the date, lot number, purchase price, profit or loss on
disposal, and the name of applicant or purchaser, and the
file number. The purchase price will represent the total
capital cost of the allotment to date as included in the
single allotment card for that allotment, and this is the
purchase price, which will be credited to Land Hot
Utilized, whilst any profit or loss on disposal will be
posted to a general ledger account styled “ Profit or
Loss on Sale of Group Land.” The result will be that
the "difference between the total progressive expenditure
on the Group Sheet and the total of the purchase price
column will at any time agree with the cost price of the
remaining allotments in the Group, as set out on Forms
Ac 6.
(Ji) If the allotment has been made available to an eligible
applicant for building purposes, the relative Form Ac 6
will be transferred as from the date of sale or allotment to
the Works in Progress cabinet, and will reflect the
accounts requirements during the period of construction
until the transfer to Personal Loan.
The cross reference between Works in Progress and the Group
Sheet will be the name of the applicant on the latter,
whilst the Form Ac 6 will show the Group and Lot Ho.
(4) Interest at 5 per cent, per annum on the total expenditure
debited in all land accounts is to be computed on a daily basis and
debited at the end of each month. This calculation of interest will cover
reserves debited when lots are priced as set out in clause (3) of this G.O.
(5) Land accounts are to be debited with all expenditure until the
block is allotted, when subsequent entries to the Works in Progress and
Personal Loan accounts will be as provided for in G.O.’s 147, 148,
and 151.
(6) At the end of each month an extraction of the balances, in the
approved form, of the single allotment cards and group sheets is to be
agreed with the general ledger account Land Hot Utilized.
Sale of Land not Required for Building Purposes.
146. (1) Land not required for the purposes of the Act, either
because it is in excess of the Commission’s requirements or it is not
considered suitable for building purposes, will be disposed of through
the Lands and Survey Branch.


(2) No land, except as in clause (10), may be disposed of without
the approval of the Minister, and, to enable this to be sought when it is
deemed advisable to act under this G. 0., the following particulars should
be submitted to C.A., covered by the necessary recommendation: —
(a) Locality;
(b) Estate or vendor;
(c) Area (a.r.p.) ;
( a nd) Cost to date;
(e) Total number of allotments available;
(/) Number of allotments suitable for building purposes;
(g) Number of allotments suitable for building purposes but not
required by Commission;
(h) Number of allotments unsuitable;
( i ) Number of unallotted or vacant houses in locality;
(j) Remarks (giving reasons land recommended for sale, and
particulars of allotments available in other estates in
locality, also any special features re land for disposal).
(3) Where Ministerial approval is obtained, as advised by C.A.,
Forms Acso and 51, supported by a memorandum setting out any
special features concerning the land, particularly as to buildings thereon,
liabilities attached thereto, and any known factors which would influence
the disposal of the land, are to be prepared in triplicate, one copy being
forwarded to C.A., one to the Lands and Survey Branch, Melbourne, and
the other filed for reference purposes.
(4) At the time the land is referred to the Lands and Survey Branch
a G.J.E. will be passed debiting an account styled “ Land
with Lands and Survey Branch for Disposal,” and crediting
Land Not Utilized. Subsequent dealings in respect of that land
will be reflected in this account, and an account to be opened styled
“ Profit and Loss on Disposal of Land Sold by the Lands and Survey
Branch,” whilst transactions in respect of sales on terms will be reflected
in an account styled “ Sundry Debtors —Land Sold through Lands and
Survey Branch.”
(5) The general ledger account Land with Lands and Survey
Branch for disposal will be supported by group land sheets in Form
Ac 7 covering individual allotment cards (Form Ac 6) to be transferred
from the Land Not Utilized sub-section. Subsequent debits and credits
will be entered on these Forms Ac 6 and Ac 7 and reflected in the
general ledger accounts as set out above.
(6) At the end of each quarter a return is to be forwarded to C.A.,
giving the following particulars :
Section 1.
(a) The total capital cost in respect of land handed to the Lands
and Survey Branch for disposal, exclusive of interest but
including fees and costs of disposal;
( b ) Interest to date; and
(c) Total capital cost.


Section 2.— Land Sold.
(a) Capital cost, exclusive of interest and costs of disposal;
(b) Costs of disposal;
(c) Interest;
(and) Total capital cost;
(e) . Total sale price;
(/) Net profit or loss.
(7) To facilitate preparation of the return mentioned a Register
will be kept in which columns headed as under will appear:
(a) Name of estate;
( b ) Reference;
(c) Capital cost;
(and) Interest added to date of transfer to Lands and Survey
Branch;
( e ) Interest subsequently added to date of sale;
(/) Costs of disposal;
(g) Total cost of land for sale (including costs of disposal);
( h ) Gross proceeds;
( i ) Profit on disposal;
(j) Loss on disposal;
(k) Principal cost of land disposed of;
( l ) Interest in cost of land disposed of;
(m) Costs of disposal of land disposed of.
This register will require to be completed as each transaction takes
place, and will be the control account to which the columns on the Forms
Ac 7 are to be balanced at the end of each month. The Capital Cost,
including interest and costs of disposal, and the Profit and Loss on
Disposal columns will be agreed monthly with the general ledger
accounts.
(8) Sundry Debtors for purchase of land through Lands and Survey
Branch will be reflected in accounts on Forms Acl, which will be kept
in a separate section of Personal Loan. The debits will result from a
G.J.E. crediting Land with Lands and Survey Branch for Disposal,
and debiting Sundry Debtors —Land Sold through Lands and Survey
Branch. At the same time the Interest and Profit and Loss accounts
will be adjusted.
(9) Particulars of collections in respect of land sold through the
Lands and Survey Branch will be entered by the Collector of Public
Moneys in a separate book (Form Ac2l) at the time the receipts for
such are issued. The original Form Ac2l will be submitted to the
Control Ledgerkeeper as a posting medium, similarly as for Personal
Loan receipts, whose duty it is to advise the Collector of Public Moneys
immediately the posting is completed of the allocation between Principal
and Interest, &c., the duplicate being retained for reference by the
Collector of Public Moneys.
(10) Offers received for single allotments not transferred as set out,
which it is desirable to sell, should be submitted to C.A. Such will
include individual allotments which have reverted as the result of
insurance damage to the structure originally erected thereon, &c.
(11) All contracts for the sale of land provide that the purchaser
may pay an extra sum in addition to the instalment by giving one
month’s notice of his intention so to do, which must expire on the quarter


day when the instalment is due. If an amount is paid and no notice is
given in accordance with the contract, then it is to be held and the
purchaser advised that interest will only be allowed after the expiration
of one month from the date of receipt of the extra amount.. If a notice
is given which does not expire on a quarter day as provided in the
contract, interest will he allowed on any payment made pursuant to that
notice from one month after the date of receipt of that notice.
Loan Accounts.
147. (1) The personal loan ledger card (Form Acll) except in
those cases referred to in clause (2) of this G. 0., will be opened from
an advice (Form L3l), which will set out the nature and amount
of security completed by the applicant. The security document must
accompany the Form L3l, and these are to he referred to the*
Accountant immediately the security document is completed. The
particulars entered from the Form L3l are to be checked with
the particulars in the security document, which is also to be checked
generally to see that all accounts requirements are covered.
• (2) In cases where fees payable in advance are received before
the preparation of advice (Form L3l) by the Senior Conveyancer,
the personal loan card (Form Acl2) will be opened from the applicant’s
personal file. In such cases the Accountant is to bring to the notice of
the Deputy Commissioner particulars of any account opened when the
security document and Form L3l are not made available by the Senior
Conveyancer within a reasonable time of the opening of Form Acl2.
For this purpose a monthly list is to be obtained from the Ledger-
keepers showing all accounts where the Personal account has been
opened and the security document and Form L3l have not been
referred to the Accountant, and indicating the date each account was
opened, and any special features.
(3) Each personal loan card is to be noted in a register and
given a consecutive number. It is to be initialed by the Accountant
or Sub-Accountant after comparison with the Form L3l and security
document. For all applicants there is a Principal card (Form Acll)
and a Miscellaneous card (Form Acl2), the former to record trans-
actions in connexion with the main advance (in building cases after
the transfer from Works in Progress), while the latter is to record
payments and repayments of such items as fees, insurance, repairs
debited (Section 31) &c., which are payable on demand or over
a shorter period than the original advance. The Form Acl2 also
contains a provision for the recording of Sinking Fund payments.
(4) In many cases the first entry to the Form Ac 12 will be a credit
representing fees paid in advance by the applicant. This credit
will be posted from the Collector’s cash book and when the debt is
liquidated by the Commission the debit will be posted from Treasury
Form 20, The postings of both debits and credits are to be made
in manner set out in G.O.’s 151 and 155.
Works in Progress.
(a) Expenditure.
148. (1) The Form Ac 6 which will be opened in some cases where
a deposit is lodged and completed from the Form Ac2l, recording the
expenditure during construction until the final progress payment is


made will be headed from Form A 3, and show full particulars of
approval as set out therein. Each Form Ac 6is to be entered in the
numerical and alphabetical register and initialed by the Accountant
or Sub-Accountant after comparison with the particulars in the Forms
A 3 or Ac2l, and later with Form L3l and Form A4, as provided
in clauses (2) and (3) of this G.O. Transfers will be made from the
Land Not Utilized section to the Works in Progress section as provided
for in G.O. 145.
(2) When the security and Form L3l are completed and referred
to the Accountant, as provided in G.O. 108 (which will in every case
be before any expenditure other than for fees paid in advance is made),
particulars are to be noted on the Form Ac 6.
(3) As soon as the building contract is let particulars will be
endorsed on the Form Ac 6, which will form the source of the check
on expenditure, and in no case is the authority under any of the
different heads to be exceeded.
(4) Each week the Chief Architect will forward a list of
the applicants for whom plans and specifications have been prepared,
and these will be used by the Accounts Section for check with the
Forms A 3 received from tiip,e to time. As Form A3 is received the
debit raised on the Form Ac 6 and the credit entered in the Architects
and Works Adjustment account the item will be deleted from the
list referred to, and it will be the responsibility of the Accounts Sec-
tion to ensure that the remaining items on the list are covered by a
Form A 3 within a reasonable period.
(5) All expenditure will be posted from the Form Ac 44 made
available to the Construction Sub-section. These Forms are to be re-
tained in this Sub-section in numerical order.
( b ) Receipts.
(6) The Collector of Public Moneys, when issuing a receipt for
moneys received during construction (excepting fees credited to
Personal Loan), will enter particulars for posting on Form Ac2l,
a special book of which is to be used to cover all receipts during
construction, except the fees as mentioned.
(7) The original Form Ac2l will be forwarded daily to the
Construction Ledgerkeeper, who will post therefrom.
(8) The total of the duplicate Form Ac2l will be posted to the
cash book, reference being made to its number. The book containing
the duplicates will be retained by the Collector of Public Moneys.
(c) Journal Entry Debits.
(i) Architects and Supervision Charges.
(9) Fees, in accordance with the prescribed rate on the accepted
tender price, to cover the cost of Architects and Works Supervision
will be charged to the applicant immediately the tender is accepted
by debiting the Form Ac 6 and crediting the Architects and Works
Adjustment account by a G.J.E. and adjustments if necessary made
upon the completed contract price. In those States where arrange-
ments have been made with country Architects, the debit to the Form
Ac 6 is to be posted immediately the tender is accepted, and adjust-
ments, if necessary, made upon actual payment to the Architect.


(ii) Interest.
(10) Interest at 5 per cent, on expenditure and debit from land will
be calculated on a daily basis and debited at the end of each month, and
will be affected by the deposit paid in by applicants. Where loans are
made under a mortgage the applicant should pay progress interest in
cash, hut in special mortgage and all contract of sale cases the interest
may be capitalized.
(iii) Fencing.
(11) Where the Commission builds the fence and part payment
is due by an adjoining owner, the whole cost should be included
in the building contract and security and the applicant debited there-
with on Form Ac 6 but a Deputy Commissioner may, in his discretion,
include only half cost in the security and so debit the applicant on
the Form Ac 6, provided the applicant undertakes in writing to pay on
demand the amount due by the adjoining owner two months after the
date set down for payment, together with interest at the prescribed
rate.
(12) If necessary, notices will be issued as in G.O. 87 (3),
and when the file is referred for notation personal accounts will be
opened in the name of adjoining owner*. At the same time as the
applicant is debited on the Form Ac 6, a Gf.J.E. will be passed debiting
the adjoining owner and crediting an account termed “ Half Cost of
Fencing Adjustment” account.
(13) As amounts are collected a G.J.E. will be passed, after the
adjoining owner’s account has been credited, which will credit the
applicant’s Form Ac 6 and debit Half Cost of Fencing Adjustment
account. The entry will he passed through the Works in Progress
account to complete notation in the Construction account, and if the
total has been transferred to Personal Loan, it will be necessary to
pass a further journal entry debiting Works in Progress account, and
crediting Personal Loan account.
(14) Where a Deputy Commissioner decides that only half cost is
to be included in the contract then an account for the adjoining owner
who is to contribute will be opened, debited with the amount involved
and credited with the payment as received. (See G.O. 87 (8) ).
( a nd) Survey Fees.
(15) These, when collected, will be credited to the applicant’s
Form Acl2 and the payment to the Surveyor debited to that account
from Treasury Form 20. Where the applicant makes his own arrange-
ment for the survey no entries will be made in the accounts records.
(16) Where the survey is carried out by the Commission’s officers
or the Lands and Survey Branch the debit to the Form Acl2 will be
effected by a G.J.E. and the credit will be reflected in the Survey
Adjustment account.
(e) Deposits.
(17) Applicants will not be credited with interest on any deposits
lodged, whether in supplementation of a loan or otherwise, and when
such are received they will be entered on the Form Ac 6 and credited
to Expenditure.
(18) The first expenditure on behalf of any applicant who has
lodged a deposit will be made with the amount of the deposit.


(/) Statement of Account.
(19) As soon as possible after the final progress payment has
been made a statement of account (Form Acß) will be prepared
and forwarded to the applicant, particular care being taken to ensure
that all miscellaneous amounts are fully taken into account. When it
is not possible to make the final progress payment because of some
reason other than a dispute as to the amount or in connexion with
the construction, e.g., absence of claimant, the accounts shou and e
finalized and Form Acß forwarded to the applicant.
(20) The statement of account, in conjunction with the Form L3l,
will be the basis for the issue. _ of the repayments book,
except in those cases where occupancy is given prior to the final pro-
gress payment, and also for the journal entry transferring the debit
from the Form Ac 6to Form Acll. It must be checked by the
Certifying Officer with the Form Ac 6 and final progress payment when
he is certifying to the latter. Payment of the maintenance sum will
then offset the credit raised on the Form Ac 6 by the transfer to Form
Acll.
( g ) Record of Occupation.
(21) Upon advice from the Chief Architect that a home is ready
for occupation the Construction Sub-section will enter particulars in
an alphabetical Register in the approved form.
(22) The appropriate columns in this Register will be completed
when the Form Acß is despatched.
( h) Statistics of Houses Erected.
(23) At the end of each month the Chief Architect will supply,
on the approved form, particulars of applicants wdio were given per-
mission to occupy during that month.
(24) This form will be checked with the alphabetical Register and
placed in a binder as a permanent record of the number and cost of
construction —with and without land —of all houses completed in any
financial year.
(25) The particulars of cost will be entered in the appropriate
columns of the form by the Construction Sub-section at the same time
as the notation is being made as to the despatch of the Form Acß.
( i ) Monthly Balance.
(26) At the end of each month the balances of the Form Ac 6 are to
be extracted and agreed with the relative general ledger account.
Fees Due and Paid.
149. (1) The collection of fees due and payable in advance will be
arranged through the General Section prior to authority being given
for the relative service to he carried out.
(2) Where surveys or valuations are made through an outside
source the debit to the personal account will be posted on the payment
of the claim. This also applies to legal and search fees.
(3) Where the services are carried out by the Commission’s officers
the charge will be in accordance with the approved scales.


(4) With the exception of the charge for preparation of plan
and supervision in major construction, all fees must be paid prior
to the particular service being effected.
(5) The Senior Conveyancer will supply the Accountant weekly
with a statement of fees paid, and attach thereto a claim for reimburse-
ment of the full amount expended from the advance held by him.
Entries in Personal Loan Accounts.
150. Entries in the Personal Loan account, apart from debits for
purchase Expenditure and transfers from Works in Progress, will
constitute —
(a) Repayments of instalments, fees, &c.
( b ) Expenditure—Payment of rates to Councils on account of
applicants, &c.
(c) Transfers between applicants and resales.
( a nd) Discharges of liability to the Commission.
(e) Transfers from house property not disposed of.
(/) Transfer journal entries —debiting Sinking Fund and
crediting Repayment of Principal and Interest Repaid,
&c.
( g ) Debiting of instalments and insurance premiums.
(h) Crediting interest on Sinking Fund.
( i ) Liquidation of small amounts.
(j) Administrative charges.
Debits to Loan Accounts.
(a) Construction.
(b) Acquisition of Existing Homes.
151. (1) In construction cases the first entry on the Form Acll will
emanate from a G.J.E. transferring the final debit from the Form
Ac 6. The number of the journal entry must be endorsed on the Forms
Ac 6 and Acll as a reference.
(2) In the acquisition of existing homes, which includes purchases
and discharge of mortgages, the debit for expenditure will be posted
from debit notes direct to Form Acll, the originating source being the
Form Ac 32. At the same time as the Accountant initials the claim
form after comparison with the approval the Form Ac 32 will be
debited, and when the settlement is effected it will he credited. This
cash hook will reflect the details in the Departmental Advance account.
(3) Forms Acll and 12 are self-explanatory, and all the headings
must be completed in every case. The cards have so been devised that
they become a controlling factor on the expenditure as they set out the
amount of the original authority and any subsequent increases.
(4) The responsibility for ensuring that the debit to the Form
Acll does not exceed the amount of the loan authorized or the amount
of the security devolves upon the Accountant.
Fixation of Instalments.
152. (1) The amount of the monthly instalment and the com-
mencing date will be set out in the security document and included in
the Form L3l from the Senior Conveyancer.


(2) Each instalment is to be determined on loan multiples of
£lO, so that where the loan equals such a multiple the equivalent
instalment according to the Repayment Tables will be inserted in the
security. Where the loan is an odd amount the instalment will be
fixed on the succeeding multiple of £lO.
(3) The term will not be set out in the security document.
(4) Where repairs are carried out, or extra advances are granted
for any purpose, the instalment should be fixed on the nearest £1
beyond the actual cost. For instance, if the actual cost is £lO 95., the
instalment would he based on £ll.
Calculating Interest for Inclusion in Instalment.
153. (1) Each instalment is composed of two elements, i.e., prin-
cipal, and interest at 5 per cent., and whilst the instalment itself does
not vary its elements do.
(2) To enable the variations to be properly entered in the accounts
the interest charge must be raised each month on the balance out-
standing, and the difference between that sum and the instalment
itself will represent the principal repayment.
(3) The following figures show the basis of calculation: —
Ist January balance .. .. £6OO 0 0
Ist February interest . . . . 2 10 0
£602 10 0
February instalment paid .. 7 10 0
Net balance .. .. £595 0 0
If the February instalment were paid on Ist February the interest for
the March instalment would be calculated on £595, but if such were
paid later the balance for calculation of interest would be £602 10s.
If Ist February fell on a Sunday or public holiday, the next business
day would be regarded as Ist February for the purpose of this G.O.
(4) A schedule is to be prepared by each Ledgerkeeper each month
setting out the allocation between principal and interest, which will
be used as the posting medium. A G.J.E. will be neces-
sary to agree the ledger balance of personal loan with the
balances of the individual accounts and to introduce interest earned.
The debits in the schedule are to be checked to the extraction of
balances by the Control Ledgerkeeper to ensure that interest is being
debited in respect of each current account.
Control Journal and Ledger.
154. (1) For the purpose of control, the control journal is divided
into two sections, viz.:—
(a) Cash.
(b) Journal Entries.
Each journal contains a section for each ledger section and class of
account, the latter comprising tenancy, personal loan, and civilians.


(2) Every debit or credit to a Personal Loan account (with the
exception of instalments debited or credited) is posted from a debit
or credit note, or Form Acl'9 (Transfer of Cash Receipts) as the
case may be, but no posting is to be made to an individual account
(except in the case of debit instalments referred to in G-. 0. 153 (4))
until the summary of the debit or credit note in which it is included
has been posted to the control journal.
(3) The control journals will be totalled under the various
sections and summarized at the end of each month for posting to the
control ledger, which is to contain, similarly as for the journal,
separate accounts for the separate sections and the different classes
of accounts and a total account for control of arrears and balances
separately.
Repayment of Instalments, &c.
155. (1) The credit notes for personal loan receipts will be sum-
marized by the Collector in ledger sections in lexicographical order and
passed with the Collector’s daily advice to the Control Ledgerkeeper,
who will make the necessary entries in the control journal and pass the
credit notes to the Ledgerkeeper for posting and allocation in accord-
ance with Regulation 24.
(2) The summaries, when the posting to the personal accounts has
been effected, are to be returned immediately to the Control Ledger-
keeper for entry, and advice of the allocation will be made monthly
to the Collector, w r ho is to reconcile such with the total of the collec-
tions in that period according to the cash book. The summary will be
made up in two sections as under: —
(a) Receipts through the Postmaster-General’s Department;
(b) Receipts at the Commission’s branches.
(3) Receipts through the Postmaster-General’s Department will
be brought to account from Forms Ac 22.
(4) These forms are to be entered into a Register of Repayments
(Form Ac. 23), and when the weekly cheque is received from the
Postmaster-General’s Department on a requisition by the Collector,
the total of the cheque is to be entered into the Collector’s cash book.
(5) A reconciliation monthly must be made by the Collector with
the Postmaster-General’s Department, and any advised collections by
Post Offices on the Forms Ac 22 which have not been brought to
account by the Postmastel'-General’s Department are to be adjusted.
(6) Particulars from the Form Ac 23 will be entered daily on
Forms Ac 24 and the consecutive number checked to see that all Forms
Ac 22 have been received and any missing forms immediately requisi-
tioned from the Post Office.
(7) The Forms Ac 24 supply particulars for the lists of receipts
from various Post Offices forwarded for reconciliation with the Post-
master-General’s Department each month.
Sinking Fund Deposits and Interest.
156. (1) Any payment made by an applicant in excess of what is
due will be credited to the applicant’s sinking fund account.


(2) The sinking fund deposits will earn interest at 5 per cent, per
annum, calculated on the minimum monthly balance throughout the
year, and posted at 30th June each year. Interest will be allowed only
on multiples of £l, and assuming a sinking fund had a credit ot £-1 19s.
in any month, interest would he calculated on £4.
(3) Sinking fund credits are available for use as set out here-
under :
(a) In payment of instalments due; or
(&) As an addition to an amount tendered by an applicant to
discharge his total liability (Section 29).
Such transfers from a sinking fund must be made by Treasury journal
entry and will not be made to liquidate instalments due until the 22nd
of each month and prior to the issue of arrears notices.
(4) In no case is a civilan to he accorded the benefit
of Section 29 of the Act relative to sinking fund interest. The security
document with civilians sets out the rights and liabilities
of both parties, and these provide for certain payments m excess of the
monthly instalment to be used in reduction of the principal owing.
Miscellaneous Expenditure.
157. Miscellaneous expenditure in respect of Personal Loan
accounts, such as rates, &c., will be posted from debit notes prepared
by the Appropriation Ledgerkeeper, who will summarize them in ledger
sections and pass them to the Control Ledgerkeeper for subsequent
action similarly as in the case of receipts.
Transfers in Personal Loan.
158. In personal loan accounts the debit and credit notes will be
summarized by the Control Ledgerkeeper, and, after necessary, entry
to the control journal, passed to the Ledgerkeeper for entry in the
accounts.
Appropriation of Instalments (Reg. 24).
159. (1) Small debits payable on demand and recorded on the
Form Acl2 are to be liquidated immediately from the first payment
made by the applicant, and a notification of the action taken forwarded
to the applicant.
(2) In appropriating instalments in this way regard must be had to
the provisions of Regulation 24.
(3) Insurance premiums when debited will be retained on the
Form Acl2 for two months, and if not paid then liquidated from the
next instalment paid by the applicant. All such debits must earn
interest with the exception of those for repairs (Section 31), and such
will be calculated by regarding the amounts outstanding on the Form
Aci2 as part of the balance on the Form Acll for arriving at the
amount of interest to be included in the instalment.. In this way
separate posting for interest in respect of minor items is obviated.
(4) In the case of repairs the interest will be raised on the Form
Acl2 similarly as on the Form Acll.


Check of Postings.
160. There must be a complete check of all ledger postings, and the
Ledgerkeepers are to carry out this check as instructed by the Account-
ant. It must also cover the last payment inserted by the applicants on
the Form Acls, and the address.
Insurance Premiums.
161. (1) These are debited only from advice from the Insurance
Section (debit note and copy of renewal notice provided in G.O. 216),
and the Ledgerkeeper must see that particulars of the commencing
date, certificate and amount of annual premium are shown on the
Form Acl2 before the debit is posted.
(2) A T.J.E. is to be passed covering the total of the summarized
debit notes, crediting Insurance Premiums- Received and debiting
Personal Loan account.
(3) The total credits to Insurance Premiums Received must be
reconciled with the monthly return prepared by the Insurance Officer.
(4) When an insurance premium is paid by an applicant direct or
by appropriation of his instalments, such will be regarded for Treasury
purposes as repayment of principal.
(5) G-. 0. 159 makes provision for the liquidation of insurance
premiums not paid by an applicant, hut in any case, as the Insurance
Fund has already received the credit, no amount will be written off as
a bad debt for insurance. Premiums unpaid in respect of any property
reverting to the Commission will contribute finally to the loss or reduce
the profit on resale.
Audit of Repayments Books.
162. (1) At least once in every twelve months from the date of
issue of a repayments book, or the date of the last audit in the case
of a book issued prior to this instruction, the book is to he called in
and audited.
(2) Where books are required a list of the applicants concerned
will be prepared and forwarded to the officer receiving payment, i.e.,
the Postmaster or the Collector of Public Moneys at the Branch Office.
The lists should .be forwarded at irregular intervals, but so that each
book will be audited at least once in each twelve months.
(3) To .control the audit a register is to be kept showing the names
of the applicants in alphabetical order (as far as possible) under each
Post Office or the Branch Office where payments are made.
(4) When the book is requested a pencil notation of the date is to
be made against the applicant’s name in the register, and any subse-
quent reminders will be noted in pencil until the hook is received, when
the pencil entries will be deleted and the date of receipt noted in ink.
The date of despatch of the book to the applicant is to be noted in ink
in the appropriate column.
(5) If the foregoing action is closely followed the audit of repay-
ments books register will constitute a complete and permanent record
of the time the book is in the office and will be the basis of the issue of
lists.


(6) When a list is sent to a Post Office the Postmaster should he
advised to inform each applicant at the time the next payment
is made by him that his book is to be forwarded for audit purposes, and
he is to supply each with the approved cover, properly addressed, neces-
sary supplies of which will he made available by the Commission. In
the case of the Collector the applicant will be required to place his
books in the receptacle provided, and this will be cleared daily by the
officer auditing the hooks.
(7) Upon receipt of the hook the payments since the last audit will
be listed by the Burroughs Operator, and the Ledgerkeeper will check
the dates and the amounts of the individual payments to the credits in
the Personal Loan account, and report any variation to the Personal
Loan Officer. At the same time, if there is no discrepancy in the
payments credited to the applicant’s account and in the total credits
from the inception, the Ledgerkeeper will prepare Form Ac4B and refer
the book, with this attached, to the Officer dealing with the record of
repayments books.
(8) The officer auditing the hooks is to check with the Burroughs
list and with the Personal Loan account, also with the Form Ac4B.
Any queries or discrepancies which arise as the result of the check must
he referred to the Accountant for adjustment. The only officer author-
ized to make an alteration in either the book or the Loan account is the
Accountant, who is to initial any adjustments and, where necessary,
bring them to the applicant’s notice in a covering letter when returning
the book.
(9) When the audit of any repayments hook is completed the Form
Ac4B will be initialed by the Ledgerkeeper and checking officer, and
the Personal Loan account and the record of repayments book will
be stamped showing the date of the audit and the initials of the officer
who carried it out. A red ink total will he shown on the personal
loan card, corresponding in the various columns with the relative
figures on Form Ac4B.
(10) The hook must be returned direct to the applicant, either
through the post or over the counter, by the officer responsible for the
audit. Under no circumstances is it to he handed to any other officer
for. delivery unless the Accountant gives a special approval for this
action.
Sales to Civilians.
163. (1) A. separate section of the Personal Loan account in the
control ledger is to he kept for these cases and balanced similarly as
in the case of eligibles as set out in these G.O.’s and the balance will he
shown in the general ledger in a separate account.
(2) In dealing with these cases regard must be had to the contract
in each case and the provisions of such closely followed.
(3) Where a civilian makes a payment in advance it is to be
credited to the principal owing by him and the purchaser advised of the
action taken. If he requires the payment to be available for future
instalments under his contract then the amount will be credited to a
separate section of his account and the purchaser advised that such pay-
ment cannot be credited with interest, nor will the payment rebate
interest on the equivalent sum of the principal amount of the purchase
money owing by him.
1009.—4.


Repayment of Loan.
164. (1) Where an applicant signifies his intention to repay his
loan a statement of liability in the approved form is to be completed
by the Ledgerkeeper and checked with the applicant’s personal file
by the checking officer, who is to see that the total amount and date are
written in ink and initialed by him.
(2) The repayments hook is to be audited to date of discharge, and
immediately before the discharge is completed the Collector of Public
Moneys shall ascertain from the Personal Loan Officer and the Insur-
ance Officer that no debits or credits have been brought to notice subse-
quent to the completion of the statement of liability.
(3) After the total amount owing by the applicant has been paid
the Senior Conveyancer must immediately obtain the Ledgerkeeper’s
initials, and then after action by Legal Section the file is to be referred
under cover of Form 14 to tlic Accountant &nd Insuranco Officer for
notation and cancellation of accounts and records and advice to rating
bodies.
(4) In no case is a discharge to be acted upon unless the Collector
certifies, in writing, that the amount received from the applicant is
sufficient to cover his total liability, including interest for the day on
which the loan is repaid and any exchange on cheques submitted, as set
out on Form Ac3l.
Homes Not Disposed Of.
165. (1) The nature of the cards on which the balances relative to
completed houses which are not the subject of a security document
are to he recorded is as set out hereunder: —
(a) Houses which have not been allotted. (Works in progress.)
(b) Houses which have been allotted, hut where the security
document is now cancelled. (Personal loan.)
(2) When any of these houses are let on a tenancy basis, a tenancy
card is to he opened and a cross reference made between it and the
card showing the balance.
Eligible Tenant Who Purchases House Occupied.
166. (1) Upon the sale of the property to a tenant (who is also an
eligible applicant) action is to be taken to credit the personal loan
card of the applicant with amounts paid in by him as rent in respect of
the property he has contracted to purchase. The credit will be
allocated to: —
(i) Insurance premiums from the inception of tenancy.
(ii) Insurance claims, the responsibility of the applicant, paid
by the Commission during the tenancy.
(iii) Hates, repairs, and other charges paid by Commission from
inception of tenancy.
(iv) Interest on sale price from inception of tenancy. Note.

last day of a month in order to obviate a broken
interest charge before the first instalment under the
security is payable.
(v) Reduction of principal.
Note. —Ho interest is to be allowed on payments under
the tenancy agreement.


(2) The sale price will be debited to the personal loan card by
journal entry from the works in progress card or the personal loan
card of the ex-applicant, and, in the case of the latter, accounts action
similar to that in respect of a transfer is to be taken.
Tenancy Accounts.
167. (1) A separate section of the control ledger will be set aside for
the tenancy accounts, to control the arrears, as in the case of personal
loan accounts.
(2) Upon receipt of advice that a property is tenanted particulars
of the tenancy will be entered into the weekly debit journal from which
debits will be posted daily to the tenancy accounts by the various
Ledgerkeepers.
(3) At the end of the month a summary sheet will be completed
by the Ledgerkeepers showing the total daily debits for entry to the
control.
(4) This summary sheet is to be checked with the weekly debit
journal by the checking Ledgerkeeper, and at intervals by the Control
Ledgerkeeper, to ensure that all debits have been brought to account.
(5) Debits for rates paid on account of tenants will be posted as
under: —
(a) To the tenant, where such tenant is due for payment of
rates.
( b ) To Bent Earned Account, where the tenant is not liable for
the payment of rates.
(6) Cash receipts will be posted from Form Acls similarly
and at the same time as personal loan credits, and Ledgerkeepers must
throw out the correct dissection of such postings on the summary sheets.
(7) At the end of each month the Accountant will prepare a list
of all houses available for disposal, showing in respect of each whether
the security document has been cancelled, and if so the date of can-
cellation, and whether the house is tenanted or vacant. This list
will be passed to the General Section for check with the cards giving
particulars of approved price, &e., kept in that Section.

be prepared by the personal loan Ledgerkeeper and checked with the
personal file of the applicant by the Control Ledgerkeeper, care being
exercised to ensure that all auxiliary expenses and fees are included,
even if unpaid at this time.
(2) The Form Ac 47 makes provision for the full cost of the
property to be shown, as well as the original sale price to the first
applicant, and it will, therefore, be necessary to closely follow the
account, as subsequent sale at liability (as in the case of widows)
might have been completed.
(3) The repayments book of the transferror must be audited to
date of transfer, and immediately prior to settlement a Form Ac3l
is to be prepared by the Ledgerkeeper and checked by the Control
Ledgerkeeper. This Form Ac3l is the basis on which the legal officer
requisitions for funds to cover any payments to the transferror.


(4) The transferror’s account is to be noted in red ink in every case
with the J number, and name of the transferee, the date of transfer,

case will be to a civilian, the entries will be similar to those set out
for Resales under Section 28b (G.O. 174), except that the debit to
the purchaser’s account and profit or loss on disposal will be entered
in separate accounts in the general ledger.


Disposal of Properties Reverted from Civilians.
176. (1) Contracts with civilians, with few exceptions, are
divisible into two distinct classes—
(a) Those which provide for forfeiture of deposit hut do not
mention principal repaid or profit; and
(b) Those which provide for forfeiture of all payments by the
applicant hut do not mention profit.
(2) In every case, upon a resale of the house, all arrears of interest
and charges in the ex-purchaser’s account will he liquidated by debiting
Repayments of Principal, Civilians, to the extent of the amount
received, and if this is not sufficient then by a T.J.E. debiting Item (3)
(and), Personal Loan, and crediting Interest on Charges (Principal) Re-
paid, as the case may be. The resulting balance will still be the same,
and will represent the liability of the ex-purchaser up to the date of
resale, reflected in the principal sum. All expenses of disposal are to
be debited to the ex-purchaser, and his account will be credited with the
total resale price, which, in the case of a terms sale, will be debited to
the purchaser. The result will evidence the profit or loss on disposal
and will require to be treated as set out hereunder, according to the
terms of contract.
(3) dii the class of contract mentioned in clause (1) (u), the prin-
cipal repaid (not including the deposit), remaining after liquidation of
arrears as provided must be paid to the ex-purchaser, but in
no case will such payment be in excess of the profit remaining in the
ex-purchaser s account, less the deposit, after action has been taken as
set out above, i.e., in no case will the posting of the payment result
m a credit less than the deposit in the ex-purchaser’s account. The
credit remaining after payment to the ex-purchaser will be transferred to
the credit of an account styled “ Profit and Loss on Resales of
Properties Reverted from Civilians/* and following the procedure this
profit will include any deposit paid by the ex-purchaser and which, in
accordance with the provisions of the contract, is to be forfeited.
(and) In the class of contract referred to in (1) (&) the ex-purchaser
is not entitled to receive any amount, and the total credit remaining
account a ft er the resale should be credited to the account,
‘Profit and Loss on Resales of Properties Reverted from Civilians.’’
It is not proposed to open a forfeited principal account in respect of
civilians.
(5) In either case, where a loss occurs on resale, action to recover
is to be taken provided the facts regarding the ability of the debtor
to satisfy a judgment justify such a course. In any case where the
loss is not recovered, the amount will be transferred to “Profit and
Loss on Resales of Properties Reverted from Civilians,” provided the
approval of C.A. has been obtained. P
(?) Whilst in each form of contract provision is made for the
forfeiture of certain sums paid by the ex-purchaser, in determining the
loss on resale credit will require to be given for all sums paid, and the
amount to be claimed from the ex-purchaser will equal the difference
between the net liability and the resale price after debiting against
the ex-purchaser all charges and expenses incurred and chargeable under
the contract.


(7) In all cases rates outstanding will be dealt with in accordance
with the rating arrangement (G.O. 78). Where the Commis-
sion pays rates in respect of tlie period of if there is
no sum due to the ex-purchaser the amount is to be included in the claim
against him. Where the Commission has not paid rates ? but such
are due by the ex-purchaser, and no credit is due to him, in the first
communication to him demanding payment of the deficiency on resale
he is to be advised of the rates outstanding and requested to make
arrangements for their liquidation. At the same time the rating
authorities should be advised of the position, and asked to take urgent
action to recover the amount owing. Where there is any amount
due to the ex-purchaser it is to be utilized in payment of any rates or
charges outstanding before any payment is made to him.

payments are made by the applicant, or by appropriation of his instal-
ments under Regulation 24.


(&) Cost to be borne by Commission. .
(8) The action to be taken will be similar to that m the preceding
instance except that the cost will be charged to an account styled
“ Structural Eepairs Commission” or “Faulty Constructaon Bank

(c) Cost to be borne by Insurance Fund.
(12) The action to he taken will he similar to that in the case where
the cost of the repairs is to he borne by the applicant, except that the
total cost will he debited to the Insurance Fund, after crediting the
contribution of £5 by the applicant where this is required m any case.
(18) Where the repairs are due to flood or tempest damage and the
cost is under £5 and the applicant is required to have the repairs
carried out, the cost of the inspection in accordance with the scale
laid down is to be debited to the Insurance Fund under the heading of
Administrative Expenses.
(and) Cost to be borne by the Contractor.
(14) Generally these cases will eventuate as the result of the con-
tractor failing to carry out repairs during the maintenance period,
and the authority will set out whether the applicant is to he charged

outstanding liability in respect of the house itself.
Construction Section Charges.
179. (1) The G.O.’s provide for extra advances to be made for
accommodation, sewerage, and a number of matters, and in each case
the appropriate charge to cover the service rendered by the Con-
struction Section is to he paid by the applicant in advance.


(2) Where services are rendered in respect of group land the charge
will be debited to the cost of the land. Charges have not been laid

construction, the applicant, or the group land, and crediting Architects
and Works Adjustment account.
(5) Apart from extra advances inspections will be made in con-
nexion with transfers, sale of portion of land comprised in a

upon to carry out, and the principle governing the allocation of the
charge to a particular account will be similar to that in the preceding
G.O.
Administrative Charges.
181. (1) Charges in accordance with the approved scale for each
State are to be made in respect of services rendered in connexion with
any matter enumerated in such scale.
(2) The charge to be made in connexion with sales under Section

ministrative Expenditure—Salaries is to be passed covering all charges
for arrears action, except where it has been necessary in country cases
to attend the Court, when the credit must first be allocated to travelling
expenses to cover actual payments incurred, and then to salaries.
(4) This journal entry will cover all cases dealt with during the
month, and in the meantime the personal loan cards of the applicants
are to be noted to the effect that the charge is to be debited, in order that
the debit will not be overlooked.


(5) No debit is to be accepted in respect of tbe charges mentioned
in (1) until the fee has been received, unless the Deputy Commissioner
so directs on the file.
(6) The credit to salaries is to be posted to separate general ledger
accounts, styled: —

(ii) Administrative Costs in Resales under Section 36 (2); and
(iii) Administrative Costs in Ejectment Cases;
covering respectively the credits in respect of the services mentioned

book and the total posted to the Collector’s cash book, the reference
being the consecutive number of the Form.
(2) The original Form Ac2l will be forwarded daily to the Sub-
Accountant, who, after checking the various accounts to ensure that the
posting has been properly effected and allocation of the credits advised
to the Collector of Public Moneys, will suitably file the same for ready
reference.
Balancing Accounts.
183. (1) By the end of the month the total credits and debits
appearing in the Collector’s cash book and appropriation ledger re-
spectively are to be posted. The personal loan Ledger-keepers will
extract the balances of the accounts on the form provided. Personal

been cancelled, must be included on separate sheets.
(2) When all the Ledger-keepers have balanced with the control
account, this must be agreed with the relative account in the general
ledger.
(3) Extractions of balances in the construction accounts, sundry
debtors and sundry creditors, must also be made monthly and balanced
with the general ledger accounts.
(4) The balances must be presented by the Ledger-keeper to the
Control Ledger-keeper and on no account by the Control Ledger-keeper
to the Ledger-keepers.
Losses.
184. (1) In no case is an amount to be debited to a loss account
without the prior authority of C.A.
(2) On receipt of this authority a G-.J.E. making the transfer will
be passed, and at the end of the month particulars of the amount so
transferred must be submitted to C.A. on the statement of losses under
all headings.
Expenses Accounts.
185. (1) These are divided into (a) Capital, and (&) Administra-
tive.


(2) The capital expense accounts include repairs, &c., while adminis-
trative expense accounts'comprise salaries and expenses of the adminis-
trative staff.

administrative expenses and capital expenses, full particulars are to he
referred to C.A. for decision.
Branch Assets.
186. (1) Non-expendable assets, i.e., office furniture and equipment,
motor vehicles, typewriters, text-hooks, drawing, office and other instru-
ments, &c., are to he recorded in a bound register, entitled “ Branch
Furniture and Equipment.”
(2) A division will be created for each type of asset, allocated in
alphabetical order of the assets, and each columnized as under: —
(a) Date of purchase.
(b) Cost of article and any descriptive numbers.
(c) Order number.
( a nd) Depreciation written off.
(e) Disposal, and number of Treasury Form 41 containing
authority to sell, and loss or profit on disposal.
(3) A typewritten list will he prepared showing the allocation of
the different assets in the Sections, and this list must he signed by the
senior sectional officer, who is responsible for their care and custody.
(4) The loss on disposal of administrative assets is to he debited to
administrative expenses, and at the end of each year a reconciliation
effected between: —
(a) Assets on hand at beginning, plus expenditure for year, plus
liabilities at end of year, and
( b ) Assets on hand at the end, plus liabilities at the beginning
of the year, plus amount debited to administrative expenses
throughout the year.
Office Stores.
187. (1) All purchases of office stores will be entered on an indeS
card in the proper form, showing the source of supply, the quantity and
the price.
(2) Issues to officers will be made each week, or as required, by the
Stores Officer on the submission of a requisition by the Section requiring
the supplies, but no action is to be taken to record issues on the stores
cards. The requisitions will be filed according to Sections and will offer
the means of a check if such is desired at any time.
(3) It is the duty of the Stores Officer to review the quantities on
hand from time to time to ensure that proper supplies of articles used
are kept, and this officer should also bring to the notice of the Accountant
where he considers there has been any waste by any officer or Section in
the stores requisitioned for or supplied.
(4) The Accountant will authorize.the replenishment of stocks, but
the approval of C.A. must first be obtained for forms in substitution of
those in existence, or in addition to them, which have not already been
approved.


Disposal and Replacement of Assets.
188. (1) Office furniture, equipment, and motor vehicles may not
be disposed of or purchased without the approval of C.A.
(2) Where it is desired to dispose of or purchase any assets to
replace articles or add to the equipment, particulars should he
forwarded to C.A., and where disposal is involved Treasury Form 41
in duplicate.
Control of Motor Transport.
189. (1) Cars and cycles have been provided for certain officers,
and to control the running of these vehicles a running record is to he
kept in the approved form.
(2) These running records are to be closely scrutinized from time to
time, and a report forwarded to the Accountant if there is any marked
discrepancy in the running of the different vehicles. To facilitate this
work an average should be compiled of what each different type of
vehicle should be able to perform in the way of oil and petrol con-
sumption, &c., and this used as a basis of comparison with the summaries
in the motor record book, which is completed from the originals of the
running records compiled by each officer in charge of motor vehicles.
(3) In the case of motor vehicles used on capital services, deprecia-
tion is to be written off at the rate of 25 per cent, per annum, and, at
the end of each year where the market price of the vehicle has fallen
during the year, the amount of such reduction, the object being that the
motor vehicles will be shown in the books at cost less ordinary depre-
ciation and market depreciation.
(4) The percentage of depreciation is based on the original cost,
less market depreciation.
(5) Officers using official cars are to be required to make provision
for the garaging of those cars. Special supervision in respect of this is
required, and the speedometer is to be checked from time to time with
the running record to ensure that cars are used only on official business.
Architects and Works Adjustment Account.
190. (1) An Adjustments account is to be kept for the purpose of
costing the Construction Section.
(2) Detailed instructions have been issued as to the items to be
debited and credited to this account, which is to be submitted to C.A.
monthly.
(3) On the information disclosed by this account fees and charges
for the Construction Section are fixed, and at any time if a loss in the
Section is disclosed then the matter must be specially reported to the
Deputy Commissioner, whose duty it is to advise C.A. fully, together
with recommendation, in order to obviate a continuance of the loss.
Survey Adjustment Account.
191. (1) This account will be compiled similarly to the Architects
and Works Adjustment account and with the same object.
(2) Whilst charges have been laid down for defined services rendered
by the Surveyor, it is not possible to arrange charges where the Surveyor
is engaged in respect of the development of group land and similar


services. It will be necessary in these cases for the Surveyor’s diary to
be scrutinized and the value of the work done in regard to any particular
estate assessed and charged to that estate by G.J.E., which will neces-
sarily credit the Survey Adjustment account with the amount charged
to the estate.
Cost of Insurance Section.
192. (1) The Insurance Section is self-contained like the Construc-
tion Section, but there is no necessity for an Adjustment account as
the Section does not earn flat rate recovery.
(2) Instructions have been issued setting out what salaries, rent,
telephone, &c., are to be charged to the Insurance Fund, as well as the
charges for any inspections, &c., carried out on behalf of the
insurance scheme.
(3) Each month a T.J.E. will be passed debiting the Insurance
Fund and crediting the accounts with indirect charges and expenses.
Book of Plans.
193. (1) Each book of plans shows its sale price, which is 25., and
to obviate the work which would be involved in giving a receipt in
respect of each sale the books will be made available in small quanti-
ties to the counter clerks on the imprest system and at the end of each
day the officer concerned will be required to pay his receipts to the
Collector, which should be compared with the number of books on hand.
(2) Where books are issued to country Architects and those in
country areas they are to be debited to accounts in the names of those
officers, who will be held responsible for the receipts.
Development of Group Land.
194. (1) In addition to the direct costing of services rendered by the
Construction Section in the development of estates, each estate must be
charged, with a sum equivalent to the value of the work performed by
officers whose salaries are charged to administrative expenses who act in
this way.
(2) The purchase of any estate must first be approved by C.A. and
at the time the approval is communicated advice will be forwarded as to
the cost to be debited on behalf of C.A. to the particular estate.
(3) It is the Accountant’s duty to cost the services rendered by
officers in the branch.
(4) All reserves which it is proposed to raise in connexion with any
estate must be submitted to C.A. for approval, and if after completion of
development there is a credit in a particular reserve the fact should be
set out to C.A., when instructions will be given as to the ultimate
disposal of such credit.
Reorganized Administration.
195. (1) The reorganized administration is regarded as having-
commenced on Ist January, 1922, and at the close of each financial
year a statement is to be forwarded to C.A. showing in detail—
(a) The houses provided (i.e. contracts of sale, mortgages, and
building contracts executed) from the date mentioned to
the end of the particular financial year which have re-
verted to the Commission, in the form already approved;


(b) Result of operations in respect of houses provided from Ist
January, 1922, with an analysis of the profits and losses,
in the form of accounts as at present in use.
(2) These statements are of importance in reviewing the adminis-
tration with the object of reducing losses and increasing profits, as well
as disclosing difficulties associated with the provision of homes in certain
districts. The statements should, therefore, be closely scrutinized and
any benefits which may be obtained therefrom should not only he kept
in mind by the Deputy Commissioner but brought to the notice of senior
officers.
PART 6.—ARREARS SECTION.
196. The work of the Arrears Section is to a certain extent inter-
woven with that of the Accounts Section, in which all particulars in
regard to personal loan accounts are recorded, and close co-operation
is necessary to ensure efficient working.
Applicants under Three Months in Arrears.
197. (1) On the 25th of each month the Ledger-keepers will
despatch from personal loan cards —
Dorm Arl.—to applicants one month and under in arrears.
„ Ar2.—to applicants over one month and under three

satisfactory explanation for the non-payment of the amount due.
(3) The list will be referred to the Arrears Section to enable the
applicants concerned to he interviewed, or where this cannot he

(2) whose arrears remain less than three monthly instalments and
under £5 will be prepared quarterly on the 17th of the month and
referred to the Arrears Section for action as in clause (3).
(5) The action taken in every case must be briefly noted on the
particular list, which is to be returned to the Ledger-keeper for infor-
mation and necessary action.


Applicants over Three Months in Arrears.
198. (1) After despatch of the Forms Arl and Ar 2 and provided
the applicant has not —
(a) made a payment in respect of the arrears; or
(b) submitted a satisfactory explanation for of
the sum due; or
(c) entered into a satisfactory arrangement for payment ot
current instalments and gradual reduction of arrears; or
(and) been granted further time for the payment of instalments
or arrears, or both;
and the arrears represent three or more monthly instalments, on the
9th and 25th of each month, whichever date is applicable, Forms Arß
and- Ar 9 will be prepared by Ledger-keepers and referred to the
Arrears Section for despatch of Form Ar 4 in cases where no under-
taking exists and Form Ars where an undertaking has been defaulted
(2) Action as set out in Sections 30a and 36 of the Act, and
Regulation 35, will he taken in those cases listed on Form Ar 9,
and the Postmaster and Collector of Public Moneys instructed that
payments must not he accepted until further advised. A record of
the action taken in each case will be made on the list, and these will he
returned to the Ledger-keepers for notation on the personal loan card.
(3) Where a payment is offered or made after ejectment pro-
ceedings have been instituted a receipt in the following form is to he
issued: — ...
Being on account of arrears of rent owing to the Commission,
such arrears being due prior to the service of Notice of Termi-
nation of Tenancy and Notice to Quit, and not in respect of
any subsequent period. The receipt of this sum will not in any
way prejudice such Notice of Termination of Tenancy and
Notice to Quit.
and the case referred to the Deputy Commissioner for instruction as to
whether, having regard to the facts of the case, the proceedings are to
he withdrawn or proceeded with. All cases within this clause shall
be referred to the arrears officer prior to the acceptance of any sum.
Tenancy Arrears.
199. (1) On the 25th of each month Ledger-keepers will forward a
notice to tenants over two weeks and under four weeks in arrears and
note the tenancy card accordingly.
(2) On the 9th of each month all cases where the arrears are
four weeks or over will he referred to the Arrears Officer on Form
Ar 6, and definite action must then be taken to obtain payment of the
total arrears or the completion of a satisfactory undertaking. Arrears
should not he permitted to exceed four weeks in tenancy cases.
Vacated Applicants and Tenants.
200. (1) When an applicant vacates a property the contract of sale
will not he cancelled, but where this occurs as the result of steps taken
by the Commission the contract will he cancelled at the appropriate
date and the instalments paid duly forfeited by notice in the approved
form, which will be placed on the file at the time the notice of can-
cellation is sent to the applicant.


(2) Where a tenant voluntarily vacates he should be charged a
sum equivalent to the tenancy in lieu of notice of termination.
(3) In these cases the arrears are to be followed up as soon after
vacation as possible,, and if the debtor does not make suitable pay-
ments then appropriate legal proceedings are to be instituted having
regard to G.O. 201 (3).
(4) A return (Form Aril) is to be prepared at the end of each
month showing whether the debtor concerned has entered into an
arrangement for the liquidation of the amount owing and whether he
is adhering to such arrangement.
(5) FTo action will be taken by the Ledger-keepers to communicate
with vacated applicants or tenants.
(6) The return will be referred to the Arrears Section for action
immediately after the extraction is complete, and Ledger-keepers must
advise the Arrears Section on Form Ar 6 of all payments by debtors with
the exception of those cases where the undertaking is being honored.
(7) Whilst action is being taken to obtain payment of debts
owing to the Commission the early resale of the property must not
be overlooked. (See G.O. 74.)
General.
201. (1) An extraction of the arrears contained in the respective
ledger sections will be completed at the date on which receipts are
closed off each month and the schedules balanced with control. Any
discrepancies in the arrears notices prepared from the ledger cards
on the 25th should be immediately rectified.
(2) The arrears schedules are to be examined each month by the
Control Ledger-keeper, who is to report any cases where action has not
been continuous.
(3) In no case are ejectment proceedings or legal action to be
taken without the approval of the Deputy Commissioner, and in all cases
where legal action for recovery of moneys owing by vacated applicants
is contemplated the question of the applicant’s ability to satisfy any
judgment which may be obtained against him must be fully considered.
Enquiries should first be made to ascertain particulars of the appli-
cant’s gross assets and wages or other income, and unless these
inquiries disclose the applicant to be in a position to pay the amount
owing by him by even small payments proceedings should not be taken.
The case should, however, be reviewed from time to time, and, in
the event of the applicant’s position improving, action for the recovery
of the amount owing by him should be taken. In most cases inquiries
will disclose that the debtor is receiving sufficient wages or other
income to enable him to pay something to the Commission, but the
plea might be advanced that other creditors who are being paid pre-
clude the debtor from meeting his debt. In such cases it is only
reasonable that the Commission should share with other creditors,
and if the applicant declines to accept this position legal proceedings
are to be taken. Where an order is obtained for certain payments to
be made by the debtor, and in default imprisonment, this alternative
may not be acted upon without the approval of C.A.


(4) Each month a return is to be forwarded to O.A. showing
the total sum of arrears under the following headings: —
(a) Eligibles
( b ) Civilians
(c) Tenancies
showing current and vacated separately in respect of each.
(5) Where ejectment action is taken the charge to he paid by the
applicant will be as laid down.
Arrears —Civilians.
202. (1) The consideration afforded to eligible persons who obtain
assistance under the. Act will not be extended to civilians
who enter into a contract with the Commission. Where a civilian
falls into arrears with his repayments the rights of the Com-
mission as set out in the contract are to be enforced, unless, of course,
there are exceptional circumstances in the case, and these must be
specially submitted to the Deputy Commissioner.
(2) In no case should the arrears extend beyond three months
instalments.
(3) All arrears are extracted at the end of each monfth and
action should be taken promptly in respect of each case listed on
the schedule and the schedule noted accordingly.
PART 7.—INSURANCE SECTION.
Prescribed Risks.
203. All properties will be insured against fire, lightning, flood and
tempest, except where otherwise determined in individual cases. The
principles governing damage by these risks are dealt with in Regulation
53.
Insurable Values.
204. (1) All properties must be insured for their full insurable
value, which sum, in the case of anew building, will be at least the
capital cost plus 7i per cent, and the charge for plan and supervision.
(2) The amount in the case of an existing dwelling will be the
present value, i.e., replacement value, less any deduction for depreciation.
Replacement value means the sum which would have to be expended
to erect a similar dwelling with new materials at present day cost.
(3) As the effecting of insurances is left in the Commission’s
hands, great care must be exercised to ensure that each applicant is
fully covered. It will be realized that if a dwelling is under-insured
loss may fall upon the applicant.
Insurance of Instalments.
205. (1) In addition to the sum arrived at in accordance with
G.O. 204, each dwelling-house will be insured for an amount equal to
the sum of six months instalments payable by the applicant. Should
the dwelling be damaged to such an extent as to render it uninhabitable
this part of the insurance is available to meet the applicant’s instal-
ments, but not exceeding six, during such time as the dwelling is being
rebuilt.


(2) Where a property insured is destroyed or seriously damaged
and it is decided not to reinstate the same then subject to the facts
available the sum of the instalments insured will he added to, and form
part of, the claim.
Concurrent Insurances.
206. As all properties are insured for their full value concurrent
insurances with private companies will not, as a general policy, he
allowed. Such insurances carried out by applicants have no effect.
(Regulation 73.)
Homes to be Erected.
207. (1) Immediately building materials have been placed on the
site, a cover note should he issued for the full value of the dwelling,
outbuildings, and fencing, in the joint names of the contractor, appli-
cant and the Commissioner.
(2) As soon as the building has been completed, an A.O.R. shall be
forwarded to C.A. particularizing the cover note number previously
issued in respect of such property in sufficient time for the Certificate
of Insurance to he issued at the date of settlement.
Acquisition of Existing Properties.
208. (1) Immediately an existing property has been purchased on
behalf of an applicant, or an existing mortgage discharged, a cover note
shall he issued in the name of the applicant and Commissioner for the
full insurable value of the property.
(2) An A.O.R. will be prepared and forwarded to C.A.
To Enlarge a Dwelling.
209. (1) Where additions or improvements are to be effected to a
property (whether by the Commission or the applicant) a cover note
for the value of such additions or improvements will be issued.
(2) When such additions or improvements have been completed an
A.O.R. shall be forwarded to C.A.
To Discharge a Mortgage and Enlarge Dwelling.
210. (1) Where an existing mortgage has been discharged and the
dwelling is to he enlarged a cover note shall he issued for the insurable
value of the property, together with the value of the additional Work.
(2) When the additions have been completed an A.O.R. shall he
forwarded to C.A.
Authorized Officer’s Renort.
211. (1) An Authorized Officer is defined in Regulation 53.
(2) The A.O.R. should contain full particulars regarding the pro-
perty to enable an insurance to be completed. Care must be exercised
in completing the A.0.R., as it is on the information in the A.O.R.
that premiums are assessed and insurance records compiled.
(3) The A.O.R. should set out cover note numbers, also certificate
numbers previously issued in respect of the property.
(a) Commencement Date.
(4) The commencement date of insurance will he, in the case of a
building to be erected, the date materials are placed on the site, and
for an existing property the date such is purchased or a mortgage
discharged.


(&) Occupation by Tenant.
(5) Should a property be occupied by a tenant of the Commission
the name of such tenant is to be mentioned, but the insurance will be
completed in the name of the Commissioner only.. Should an applicant
sub-let his property the insurance will remain in his name, but the
applicant’s postal address should be recorded on the locality card in
order that the renewal notice may be forwarded to him personally.
(c) Location of Property.
(6) The surname of the assured should be shown in block letters.
Definite particulars as to location must be fully stated and in addition
the municipality or country town in which the property is situated.
( a nd) Special Features.
(7) As all properties are insured against flood and tempest any
special features likely to increase the risk should be recorded. Tor
instance, if a dwelling were located adjacent to a river, main drain,
or special watercourse or in a district subject to flood or tempest, the
fact should be clearly stated so that a special premium may be assessed.
(e) Materials used in Construction of Main Dwelling.
(8) (a) Outer walls. —Materials used in construction of outer walls
must be stated. Where the outer walls are of mixed construction, say,
partly wood and partly brick or other material, the values of the different
portions of the dwelling-house should be given separately. If the
dwelling is of more than one story, or if there are attic rooms, the
facts should be set out.
( b ) Verandahs. —Wooden verandahs, whether enclosed or not,
attached to brick, stone, or concrete dwelling houses, do not affect the
premium. In these cases the dwelling houses would be rated as brick,
stone, or concrete, as the case may be.
(c) Partition walls and linings. —Definite information is required
as to the construction in all rooms, passages and vestibules. In cases
