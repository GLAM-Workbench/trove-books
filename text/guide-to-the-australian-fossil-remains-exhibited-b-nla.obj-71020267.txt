FOSSIL REMAINS OF AUSTRALIAN ANIMALS.
The Post Pleiocene fossils here exhibited, comprise a series of
specimens from the rich stores of the Australian Museum Collection,
which are arranged as follows :
CLASS MAMMALIA
Section? Placentalia.
ORDER BIMANA.
Genus? Homo ?
The fractured crown of a molar tooth, probably a human
molar.*
ORDER CARNIVORA.
Genus? Canis.
Remains of the dog are scarce in every part of Australia where
fossil bones occur ; there can be no doubt, however, of the presence
in this country of a dog, daring the post pleiocene period; a few
teeth obtained at Wellington are exhibited, and with them teeth of
the common Dingo of the present day.
ORDER RODENTIA.
Genus?Mus or Hapalotis,
The fossil bones and teeth exhibited are from Wellington,
where they occur in large quantities. As far as I have been able to
ascertain, some six or more species existed, nearly all of which have
very peculiar grinders, and differ from most of the living Rodents
This group of our natural history, requires much study,
and when a careful revision of it takes place, many of the
species will have to be erased, as they were founded on no better
characteristics than a lighter or darker shade of the fur One of
our prolific authors tells us by way of preface, that he is not going
to trouble his readers with ? Anatomy,?? it is, however, much to be
hoped, that somebody else will do so, and that a classification
upon sounder principles than ? light and dark hair,? and ? long
or short ears,? will be substituted for such loose and corrupting
arrangement.
* This being the only specimen obtained, it cannot well be sacrificed for
the microscope; whatever this fragment may eventually prove to be, it
resembles nothing so much as a human molar. ?GKK.


ORDER EDENTATA.
Genus? Mylodon ?
Mylodon ? Australis ( Krefft ).
The presence of some animal, allied to the above extinct American
genus, is indicated by a single terminal phalanx, or nail-bone, with
its peculiar protecting hood, partly broken.
IMPLACENTALIA.
Section? Marsupialia.
(Pouched Animals.)
The Wombats.
Phascolomyidas.
Our fat friends ? the Badgers,? or Wombats, are well represented
in a fossil state, and existed to the number of twenty species at
least, during post pleiocene times. A modern Wombat of 901bs.
weight is considered heavy, but some of the ancient fossil animals,
judging from the size of their teeth and bones (here exhibited),
must have been more than twice as bulky.?The Wombats are
closely allied to the Phalangers (the ? Opossums and Flying
Squirrels?), and are distinguished from all other Marsupials, by
their incisor teeth, which, like those of the rodents, number two
above, and two below.
THE PHALANGERS
PHALANGISTIDiE.
Bones of animals of this group, to which the well-known ? Opos-
sums? and ? Flying Squirrels ? belong, are rare, the only specimens
observed, two fragments of a lower jaw, indicate species
allied to, or identical with the living Vulpine Phalanger ( P . vulpina'),
and the ? Sugar Squirrel,? ( Belideus breviceps .) The curious
? Native Bear? is also a Phalanger, and forms the connecting link
between the Wombats and the ?Phalangers proper? (the ?Opossums?
and ? Flying Squirrels?). All these creatures have a nail-less
thumb to the hind foot; they also possess, like the Kangaroo
family, the two small inner toes joined by a membrane.
Wombats, Phalangers, and Kangaroos, (including Wallabies and
Kangaroo-rats), never produce more than two young at a time; one
at a birth is, however, the general rule.?The Phalanger family
comprises some of our very largest creatures, namely, the gigantic
Diprotodons, Zygomaturi and Nototheri .about the position of which,
there has been much discussion. Looking at the dentition,
and comparing the incisors only, the observer is struck at once


with their close resemblance to the teeth of an ordinary native
bear. The short tail of both the ? Native Bear? and ?Wombat,?
appears to have been peculiar to the large extinct species also;
though this supposition is only based on negative evidence ?the
absence of any caudal vertebrae of a size in proportion to the other
large bones which have been found.?
It will be impossible to say more on the subject at present, and I
draw attention to the exhibits illustrating the
Genus? Diprotodon.
Consisting of several fragments of jaws and teeth, of large size.
The next is Macleay?s
Genus? Zygomaturus.
This peculiar animal, is represented by two or three species ;
the original Zygomaturus trilobus, the Z. Macleayi, and a still un-
described one, lately discovered by Dr. Mildred Creed, near Scone.
To form some idea of the size of these extinct creatures, which
in stature resembled the Wombat, attention is drawn to the large
upper incisors in the collection.
Genus?N ototherium.
Of the Zygomaturus we know the scull and teeth of the upper
series, and of the Notothere only, the lower jaw. But many of
these mandibles may yet prove to be those of Zygomaturus. It will
be necessary, however, to obtain clearer evidence on the subject, as,
for instance, palate and jaw of the same animal found close together
and properly fitting; specimens of this kind are still missing.
Genus? Thylacoleo.
Few of our extinct species have been so much misunderstood, as
this creature which Pi ofessor Owen first described. When we
had no further evidence than a few formidable looking trenchant
teeth, it was natural that the animal?s mode of life should have been
mistaken, but after the remaining teeth were found, all specu-
lation was at an end, and the ? Pouched Lion? dwindled down into
an overgrown Belideus, for no other animal of the Marsupial group,
resembles the Thylacoleo so closely as the ? Flying Squirrel ?
(Belideus jiaviv enter'). The great premolar is absent, and the
grinders differ much in the two species, but the incisors above and
below, are of the same shape, and scull and jaw, when compared
with the much larger Thylacoleo, appear to be formed on a similar
model. That it was erroneous to consider the Thylacoleo a formid-
able carnivore, and a match for the ponderous Diprotodons, is
plainly discernable fronrthe remains (nearly perfect jaws) exhibited
?many of the ?trenchant? teeth are worn quite flat, the incisors
are weak, and the upper ones, often get rounded off to


conical points, which are unfit to hold or tear tough substances
such as flesh.?
Besides these remains, others indicating a smaller allied species
have come to hand, and for this animal, I have founded the
Genus ? Plectodon,
which is distinguished by lower incisors of a peculiar form, much
shorter and more round than those of Thylacoleo ; a portion of
the enamel laps over, and covers the inner side of the tooth, like a
fold?hence the generic term.
KANGAROOS.
Macropodid^b.
Numerous species of all sizes, some several times larger than any
modern Kangaroo, existed in Australia in former ages, but their
remains are much scattered about, and upper and lower jaw are
seldom found together ?to distinguish the bones as those of particular
species, is out of the question, and we must content ourselves at
present to class them as Kangaroo, or Kangaroo-rat bones.?The
fossils which resemble, or are identical with, modern species, may of
course, be more correctly classified.
As a general rule, most of the fossil Kangaroos have shorter and
stouter tarsi than living species possess, and the greater number,
including the largest of the tribe, must be arranged with the Eal-
maturi or Wallabies, a group of Kangaroos with permanent
and often large premolar teeth.
The Kangaroos proper, of which our common Great Kangaroo is
the type, soon shed their premolars, and continue to lose the
grinders also, in such a manner, that sometimes only a pair of teeth
are left in each ramus. The Wallabies, on the other hand, wear
the teeth down. Looking at a Kangaroo?s incisors, we find the first
of the upper series comparatively small, and the third very broad;
whilst the Wallabies have the third tooth large in a vertical direc-
tion, and in most species this tooth is deeply indented by a fold.
A very clear idea of a fossil Wallaby?s incisor teeth, may be had
by examining the specimens exhibited, comparing them at the
same time with the Kangaroos? teeth near it.
In all recent Kangaroos, Wallabies, and Kangaroo-rats, the rami
of the lower jaw are moveable j in many fossil Kangaroos, this
peculiar characteristic is wanting, and the two mandibles are firmly
anchylosed, as may be observed in the two fossil species Ealmaturus
Scottii, and Ealmaturus Thomsonii here exhibited.
The premolars of the fossil species, are often very bulky, with


a deep hollow in the middle of the tooth ; another characteristic
peculiar to extinct animals of this tribe.
The genera belonging to the family Macropodidoe, are the
Genus? Bettongia
comprising the Kangaroo-rats, or more correctly speaking, the
? Bettongs,? with long hind legs, and more or less prehensile tail.?
Of these animals many remains were found at Wellington, all of
which appear to he identical with the common Bettong Bettongia
rufescens, now living in New South Wales.
The next, the
Genus? Hypsiprymnus
had very few representatives, and comprises the smaller Kangaroo-
rats with short stiff tails and short hind-legs; all Hypsiprymni
progress in the same manner as the Bandicoots.
Genus? Macropus.
The typical species is our Macropus major. Fossil remains of
closely allied species, and of others, resembling M. ocydromus, M.
rufus, and M. robustus, are in the collection.
Genus ? Halmaturus.
This genus, distinguished by permanent and often very large pre-
molar teeth, is numerously represented in a fossil state, and cannot
be estimated at less than thirty or more species ; the Wombat-like
Kangaroos, with short anchylosed jaws, are here included.
THE BANDICOOTS.
Peramelidje.
Fossil Bandicoots are not rare, but their bones are generally much
broken ; those observed were collected at Wellington, and repre-
sent with slight differences, the two living species, Perameles
ohesula, the short-nosed Bandicoot, and Perameles nasuta, the long-
nosed Bandicoot. A few remains of the
Genus ? Peragalea
were also obtained; the teeth are larger and slightly different
from the Peragalea lagotis of the present day. The discovery of
this animal was made during my last visit to the caves, in company
with Professor Thomson, when nearly all the most important speci-
mens were found. The Peragalea is Enown by the English term of
? Rabbit-Bat,? probably on account of the long slender ears, the
native name on the lower Murray, is ? Wuirrapur,? and ? Jacko,
on the Darling. The number of young produced at a litter by
Bandicoots, does not exceed four.


THE NATIVE CAT TRIBE.
Dasyuriduï¿½.
The rich deposits in the Caves of Wellington have supplied us
with evidence of the existence of two species of ? Native Cats,?
that is, a common Dasyurus viverrinus, and a ? Tiger Cat? Dasyu-
rus maculatus ;* besides these small carnivores, we have to record
the presence in post-tertiary Australia, of the formidable Sarco-
philus ursinus, the ? Tasmanian Devil,? and the still more ferocious
Thylacinus cynocephalus, Thylacine or ? Tasmanian Tiger.? The
number of teeth belonging to these creatures collected at the Wel-
lington Caves, amount to several hundred, other remains (skulls and
jaws) are as plentiful and many of their owners must have died at a
ripe old age, because their canine teeth are often worn level with the
rest of the series.
We now arrive at the last of the Australian Marsupials, the
small insectivores belonging to the
Genus? Phascogale
and
G enus?Antechinus,
These animals represent the Shrews and Hedge-hogs, of the pla-
cental division of Mammals. I mentioned that the Native Cats
bring forth 6 young at a litter, but the small Antechini are still
more prolific, and eight or even ten is their usual number. The
difficulty of discovering their remains is very great, and when,
after a Jong examination, I found a tiny jaw, less than | of
an inch in length, I thought sufficient had been done to prove their
existence in post pleiocene Australia, the jaw referred to belongs
to an Antechinus, not larger than a small mouse.
SECTION MONOTREMATA.
Genus? Echidna.
A fractured femur, which I referred to the above genus, has been
discovered at Wellington, another specimen, part of a humerus, was
obtained at the Darling Downs, and described by me as E. Owenii;
both are exhibited in the collection.
This closes the list of our Mammals, in which nearly all still living
genera are represented, with the following exceptions, namely :?Bats
(Cheiroptera ), and ? Water Rats,? of the peculiar Australian
genus Hydromys. Of the Marsupial Order, the missing genera are,
# I use the well known term ?Native Cat;? be it understood, however
that the Dasyurus have nothing to do with ?Cats,? they are marsupial
animals with a skin-fold ?not a pouch, producing six young at a litter.


the ant-eating Myrmecolius , and the aquatic ? Platypus,? (Orni
thorhynchus anatinus.)
CLASS AYES.
(Birds.)
The remains of Birds are few and fragmentary, and little can be said
about them. All the specimens (the largest the tarsus of a Wader)
are exhibited?l may state, however, that bones of the Emu
Dromaius Novas Hollandice have been found at Wellington (now in
the Bev. W, B. Clarke?s collection), and that a gigantic bird of the
Moa tribe, from the ? Leichardt Downs,? for which the name of
Dinornis Australis is proposed, was not long ago discovered 86 feet
under ground, in the above Quensland district.
CLASS BEPTILIA.
(Reptiles.)
The Reptilian fossils from Wellington consist of the carapace of a
tortoise, vertebrae of a large lace-lizard, mandibles and teeth of
various smaller species, and many bones of the extremities. I have
not had sufficient leisure to compare all the reptilian remains, the
genera which have been determined, are?
Chelodina (?) River Tortoise.
Hydrosaurus Lace Lizard.
Cyclodus Sleeping Lizard.
Grammatophora Bearded Lizard.
Trachydosaurus Shining Lizard, and
Egernia Spine-tailed Lizard.
Vertebrae of small snakes also occur, but no portion of the jaw or
scull has been noticed.
Remains of Crocodilians are common in the far north, as are also
the vertebra of a gigantic Lizard, as large as a Crocodile, which may
be seen in the Collection. It is impossible, owing to the limited
space, to exhibit everything of interest, I have therefore added a
series of Photographs, by Mr. Henry Barnes of the Museum, to
illustrate the absent specimens. The following is a list of the
Photographs of the Australian fossil remains.
