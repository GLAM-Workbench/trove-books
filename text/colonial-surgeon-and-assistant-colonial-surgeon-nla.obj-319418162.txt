I am only enabled to state the total number
attended, as I have not kept an account of
where they were visited ; many received
advice at my own house, as I make it a
rule to be at home for the purpose of
prescribing for those who are able to come,
from 9 a.m. until 11, and from 6 to 6 p.m.’
A great number of Prisoners have been at-
tended to at the various Watchhouses, of
whom no account has been kept, and also
many destitute persons, who are invariably
taken to a Watchhouse (a very unfit place
for those suffering from illness and want,)
because there is no proper asylum for them.
I have no hesitation in saying that in many
instances where death has occurred in the
Watchhouse, that had there been the
means at command of. administering com-
forts, warmth, &c., &c., in all probability
death would not have been the result.
The Police are always as kind and attentive
as in their power lays, but they have not
the means of rendering such assistance as
is required.
The diseases that have occurred are those
that mostly result from cold, wet, and
exposure, viz., Dysentery, Influenza, Cough,
Bronchitis, Pneumonia, &c., &c., and of
course Syphilis and Gonorrhoea.
