PREFACE
July 1915.
Gibaud and Son Pty. Ltd. have pleasure in presenting
their Illustrated Catalogue of every description of Brushware.
The Catalogue has been brought right up to date, and they
feel that it will facilitate business.
They desire to take this opportunity of thanking the
public for the generous support continuously accorded them
during the past forty years of the firm’s existence in
Melbourne.
The principals of the firm being Practical Brushmakers,
have every opportunity of closely studying the requirements
of the trade, and advancing with the times. This Catalogue
will demonstrate that we are ever in the forefront.
Brushware is one of those articles where quality is
essentially a test of value and the first consideration in
fixing prices. Although Brushes of various kinds, apparently
the same in number and size, may be offered at lower rates,
Gibaud and Son Pty. Ltd. are confident that their goods
will prove cheaper in the end on account of the Superior
Quality of the Materials used, and Consequent Durability.
This Catalogue is more fully illustrated than any pre-
viously issued, containing many new lines to which your
attention is particularly drawn. We have every facility for
making Brushware, having all the Latest Machinery and
Appliances, and can undertake any special article or design
which may not be included.
The Brushware manufactured by Gibaud and Son Pty.
Ltd. is well known throughout Australasia ; the Quality and
Prices have secured for them a reputation which the firm
will make every effort to maintain, and by doing so we feel
satisfied that the ever increasing patronage of the public will
continue to reward our efforts.
Established in Londpn 1862
Established in Melbourne 1876.
