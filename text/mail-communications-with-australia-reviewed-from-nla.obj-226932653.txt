AUSTR A LI AN MAIL
COMMUNICATIONS.
It is seven years since public consideration was
given to the necessity of an improvement of the
Australian Mail Service. The subject then claimed
attention from the necessity of a fortnightly com-
munication, the advisability of union among the
Colonial G overnments to insure such an advantage,
and the importance of the local authorities making
mutual concessions for the common good, in order
to prevent delay and obviate the difficulties
almost inseparable from the subject. It was then
remembered that the Australian Settlements wore
entirely self-governed, had large revenues, almost
boundless resources, and had to look to their own
revenues, not to the Imperial Exchequer, for the


means of organizing and conducting a thoroughly
efficient line of steamers. It was felt there was a
necessity for improving the communication with
the world beyond their insular dominions, and for
showing themselves worthy of the noble inheritance
they had acquired within the present century
by the genius, enterprise, and self-sacrifice of the
pioneers in colonization.
I rejoice to know that great benefits were de-
rived from this discussion. It occurred at a time
when Australia was just about to be brought into
telegraphic relations with Europe. That circum-
stance alone gave an impetus to all matters
relating to the mail service, and there seemed a
natural tendency to believe that, if messages by wire
from one end of the world to the other could be
delivered within twelve hours, it would be un-
reasonable that the “ return of post ” should still
be kept to ninety or ninety-five days, or
even longer, in case of casualty or delay to a
steamer. There was another point that then
gave significance to the subject, which was that
all the colonies were emerging from one of the


most severe and protracted difficulties which could
befall any country, especially when pastoral and
agricultural operations are the paramount indus-
tries. The drought of 1864-5-6 left great and
long-standing troubles to almost all classes.
Happily, the perseverance of the settlers was
equal to the occasion, and now there is an amount
of prosperity never before equalled in the his-
tory of these colonies. This will be at once illus-
trated by a few statistics. The total imports and
exports in 1873 of the Southern Colonies were
£84,908,585, or at the rate of £39. 15s. Id, per
head. The revenues amounted to £11,174,887.
The public debt was £44,273,033, which, being
mostly for reproductive works, except to some ex-
tent in New Zealand, can be estimated, not in
wasteful expenditure, but in its useful results by
recollecting that throughout Australia alone there
are 2,869 miles of railroads, either open or in
course of construction, while not less that 18,448
miles of telegraph lines are actually in working
order across the huge continent, or in small but
remote townships in the vast interior. Surely,


when such results have been attained, the neces-
sity for postal communication is not a mere random
assertion, but a known want; and the more fre-
quent and effective it is, the closer will the bonds
of empire become, and the more complete the re-
cognition of those rights which affinity of birth
and kindred sentiments invariably produce.
Although the result of the agitation so long
since commenced has been largely successful,
there is at present a want of cohesion among the
Australian Governments. Indeed, there may be
little prospect of unity of action unless through
dearly bought experience, or the more than pro-
bable failure of one or other of the schemes
now undergoing those crucial experiments to
which all great undertakings are subject. Let
there be a glance only at the various lines of
steamers:—
1. The Peninsular and Oriental route through
the Suez Canal, thence to Point de Galle, when
the mails are transferred to steamers that proceed
to King George’s Sound, thence to Glenelg, South
Australia, and, finally, to Melbourne, Victoria.


2. The San Francisco route, which embraces
the Sandwich Islands, Fiji, New Zealand and
New South "Wales, which is connected with London
by the remarkable journey across the United
States, and the steamers of all lines that trade
with England, or vice versa.
3. The Singapore and Torres Straits route,
which is arranged for Queensland, but passing
North Australia, will benefit that settlement, if it
should ever become a substantial reality.
4. The Cape of (rood Hope route now being
brought into operation by the St. Osyth and
Whampoa steamers, which, although not subsi-
dized, are competing for a mail contract by a
promise to perform the voyage, either to or from,
within 45 days.
There are supplemental services intercolonially,
which need not now be enumerated, although they
prove that the mails are not yet subject to effective
organization, or to those general principles which
lead to success.
Yet these various services, with one exception,
are the result of a deliberate conference held in


Melbourne about the middle of 1871. From that
period, old contracts have been revised, new con-
tracts entered into. Sora'e have worked well,
others have to achieve success. The objeot 1 hrough-
out, however, has been a more frequent communi-
cation with Australia. Indeed, the conference
accepted the principle that the time-tables of the
lines indicated should be so arranged as to provide
for the arrival and despatch of a mail every fort-
night. There were, it is true, divergent lines in
the interests of the respective colonies; but this
was foreshadowed, and has even been regarded as
indispensable ; for the Governments, while, of
course, fraternal, are more remarkable for Saxon-
like independence, which has been as much asserted
in the business of mails as though it were the one
prevailing bitter feud which marred the family
compact. The only “touch of nature” displayed,
has been fidelity to home interests; the recognition
cf the necessity of quick communication, and the
importance of maintaining such relations with com-
merce and civilization as shall place Australia in
its true position—equal in importance to all other


colonies, and necessary to tlie empire in its present
trade and future resources. This is the faith which
has been the mainspring of all the great efforts now
under consideration, and it is necessary to discuss
the result of the experiments, and in what position
the much desired fortnightly communication is
at present placed.
In considering the various systems applied to
the service, it must be allowed there are many
advantages of merely a geographical character.
In truth, there is a nobility, almost a grandeur of
design, in bringing the four continents of the
world into direct communication with the “ Great
South Land,” as Australia was once called, and,
if the plan had as many practical as theoretical
advantages, there could be no question that it ought
not lightly to be abandoned. The time will come
when the present complex system will be easy of
accomplishment, and it may be that the states-
men who are now asserting their power, are only
in advance of their age, not wanting in sagacity
or common sense.
They are certainly not taking into account the


mere “ handful of people ” for whom they are
legislating. Australia and New Zealand together
liayeonly a population of about 2,200,000, divided
into seven distinct settlements, governed by seven
separate legislatures, each struggling for ascend-
ency, and properly competing for the mastery in
federative business, and their external relations
with the Empire. Were it otherwise there would
not now be the race over every sea which how-
ever much the subject of admiration, must
be estimated by considerations of expediency and
necessity. The questions will arise, are the various
routes really serving the public interests ? Is there
any advantage accruing to one colony more than
another ? Can any one properly assert a position
of isolation to promote its own separate interests ?
In order to arrive at a solution of these ques-
tions, it may be well to recapitulate the experience
acquired. To understand all the facts described,
there must be a brief review of the labour of 22
years in steam communication with Australia. It
was in 1852 that the growing importance of
the Colonies led to the establishment of the


Australian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company
which, after a short career, was found unprofitable,
as neither a heavy subsidy for mails, nor a large
sjDecie and passenger traffic yielded adequate re-
turns. It was followed by the General Screw Steam
Navigation Company, with a fleet of remarkable
steamers ; but the enterprise was abandoned with
no good results either to the public or the Share-
holders. Both these Companies conveyed mails
via the Cape of Good Hope ; but the enterprise of
private shipowners was too much for their imma-
ture schemes, and they were beaten by lower
freights for bullion, and more economical rates for
passengers, while, as regards the Mail Service, the
subsidy was insufficient to induce the steamers to
continue to run with any reliable advantage. Simul-
taneously came the contract with the Peninsular
and Oriental Company, beginning with the
“ Chusari 3 and “Formosa,” conveying bi-monthly
mails. Since then this Company has largely
fulfilled the demands of the Australian service,
and obtained an experience which has in various
minds excited admiration and rivalry or even


hostility, as charitable feelings more or less pre-
vailed or were altogether wanting in the commercial
mind.
Amidst all these competing forces the fortnightly
communication has ever been kept in view by
those especially interested in the subject. They
are now able to review, impartially, the experience
acquired and the results achieved, the facts of
the past twelve months being available for the
investigation.
Taking Sydney and Melbourne as the ports of
departure, the “ time tables ” of the competing
lines have observed a proper relation to fortnightly
periods. This has been so throughout as regards
the departure of the mails from Australia, both via
Suez and San Francisco. Mo praise would be too
high for the commendable regard to the principle
laid down in 1871. The colonies concerned in
these arrangements have been Victoria and New
South Wales, and the governments have been true
to their professions, while leaving, of course, the
working out of the measure to those managing
the steamers engaged in these remarkable services.


How have they performed their contracts ? The
past twelvemonths’ mails from Suez have arrived,
upon an average, within 44 days, and those via
San Francisco have never performed the service in
less than 48 days; in three instances have taken
52 days, while the worst case on record has taken
as much as 58 days. It is to he carefully borne
in mind that the letters through Egypt, are con-
veyed by a well organised Company, with an
efficient line of steamers. The mails through
America are entrusted to contractors who have not
yet responsible agents, and are working with pro-
visional steamers wanting- strength, efficiency, and
completeness. It must be allowed that both of
these interesting and extraordinary routes are
almost indispensable to the welding together of the
Anglo-Saxon races; but there are opposing in-
terests to be reconciled, and Imperial considerations
must have a predominant importance.
It may be that the Colonists will be less inclined
to take these points into consideration than English
statesmen, but it must be remembered that the
mail service is a large tax on the Imperial


exchequer, that the general trade of the country
has to he borne in mind, as well as the wisest
and best arrangement for all concerned in the
Australian mail service.
Passing to the (Queensland contract, it is
singularly interesting to those concerned in the
progress of trade with the East. It furnishes the
means of direct communication between the north-
eastern and northern settlements on the Australian
coast, the whole of the Eastern Archipelago, and
the Indian Empire. There is thus a vast
population brought into relationship with a
country almost uninhabited. What a mighty
trade may he transacted ! At no distant period
millions of people from India, China, and Japan
may throng the harbours and crowd the streets
of every part of Australia ! It must be remem-
bered, too, that a portion of the colonies is tropical,
requiring Eastern or African labour to produce
cotton, sugar, and tobacco, as well as copper and
tin which have lately been found in abundance.
These resources gave significance to the Queensland
mail, which was started in a spirited manner as


far back as November 1873. The time allowed
for the passage is 19 days between Singapore and
Brisbane, the vessels calling at Java ; then, on
reaching Australia, they touch at Somerset,
Cape York; then call at Bowen, Townsville,
and Keppel Bay, and proceed afterwards to
Sydney. As yet only preliminary duties have
been performed, so that the actual working,
“ although fairly good,” cannot be used as a
criterion of what the service will be when the
steamers intended for the business are in regular
working order. The present objection to the
line is that there is no agreement for the home-
ward mails at Singapore. Letters may, conse-
quently, be detained there 14 days if they fail to
catch the steamer on its way from China to Ceylon.
The boats to be employed must be powerful,
efficient, and trustworthy; they must be so
“ timed ” as to dovetail with the other mails with
undeviating regularity; and the arrangements, to
be perfect, should have a continuing contract in
order to ensure a punctual delivery of letters in
London. The present year will determine if these


points are to be worked out with that certainty
which is an absolute necessity ; if not, the service
will be useless, and the money should be expended
in contributing to make good and comprehensive
arrangements with the other colonies.
The only other service to consider is that via
the Cape of Good Hope. The steamer “ Osyth”
performed the voyage in 50 days, almost fulfilling
the promise of her owners to do it in 44 days,
which is a “ sign of the times ” not to be disre-
garded. Were it possible to ensure such voyages,
there would be every inducement to dispatch one
of the fortnightly mails by that route, there being
no detention for coaling, always disagreeable to
passengers; no transhipments, which are fruit-
ful of irregularity and detention. But here
again experience has to be matured, and if “ one
swallow does not make a, summer,” so there must
be a succession of quick and safe voyages before a
mail communication is permanently established
by any line of steamers. For many years there
has been a succession of steamers by the Cape of
Good Hope which need not be detailed; but the


average passages of the noble old 11 Great Britain ”
have not been under 55 days, and the magnifies!”
line of which the “ Somersetshire ” was the pioneer
has not catered so much for mails as passengers
not professing to make the voyage in less than 60
days. The fact is that the veriest tyro in geogra-
phical science would pronounce the long sea route
the least applicable for mails in these days of
canals and railways, although doubtless often the
most pleasant and perfect for passenger traffic.
Here, then, we have the whole question of the
Australian mail service—still subject to experi-
ment —undergoing another series of transitions
for which it has been remarkable during the last
22 years. The present year ought to develop
more practical benefits and promote a solution of
the difficulties surrounding the fortnightly com-
munication. I venture to suggest that public
attention be now directed to the subject with
the following objects in view :
That the Australian governments merge all
minor differences in a determination to ensure a
perfect fortnightly service.


That the Imperial authorities render such
support as shall properly subsidise the most effi-
cient and reliable line of steamers.
That especial attention be given to dividing the
mails, one route being, of course, via Point de
Galle, the other through North America.
That if the latter route does not recommend
itself on Imperial grounds, it be left to the United
States government to bring it into relation with
their mails, as the trade, passengers, and nearly all
the advantages belong to their territory.
That the Australian mails be separated at
Alexandria from the Indian and China service;
dispatched in one or more boats to the respective
colonies, say one to the north and another to the
south, by which means all would enjoy quick
communication, and some at least of the local
jealousies terminated.
That the steamers through the Suez Canal be
increased, if not in size at least in steam power,
with the view of shortening the passages, which,
it is believed, may, by less detention for coaling
and a little more exertion at ports of call, be


reduced to an average passage of 40 or 41 days, it
having been proved that the Peninsular and
Oriental Company can deliver letters between
Melbourne and London in 39 days.
That, if this point be secured, the delivery of
mails would be on Friday instead of Monday
mornings, thus conferring a great public boon on
all classes by increasing the interval between the
arrival and departure of mails from five to eight
days, and establishing quick postal arrangements
with all towns in the United Kingdom, and in many
of the northern cities of Europe.
While offering these suggestions, I am not insen-
sible that mails must be conveyed with safety,
which, in fact, is more important than even acce-
lerated speed. The Australian service through
India has from the first been subject to only one
great casualty. There is every reason for believing
that the voyages can be rendered as secure as is
possible by human forethought, and as that virtue
has hitherto been conspicuously displayed, the ex-
tensive experience which has organised the largest
and most efficient fleet of steamers as the result of


private capital and individual enterprise may well
be relied on for future arrangements.
