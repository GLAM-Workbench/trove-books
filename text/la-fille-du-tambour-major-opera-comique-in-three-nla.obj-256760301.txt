ARGUMENT.
ACT I.
THE CONVENT GARDEN AT BIELLA.
Stella, the reputed daughter of an old Italian Nobleman,
the Due Della Yolta, is being educated in a conventual school at
Biella, North Italy. In the absence of the Superior, a French regi-
ment on the march, bivouacs in the Covent grounds, and the Officer
commanding the detachment, Captaine Robert, falls in love with
the young patrician. It is but a monentary gleam, however, for the
Due Della Yolta arrives with a certain Marquis Bambini, whom
he wishes Stella to marry. As the regiment resumes its march to-
wards Milan, Stella returns home with her father and proposed
husband.
ACT 11.
THE DELLA YOLTA PALACE AT NOVARA.
A family mystery breaks forth on the eve of the betrothal of Stella
to Bambini. It appears that Stella is not the daughter of the Due,
but of the Duchess only, who had been previously married to a
French soldier. Taking to the stage, after his reported death, she had
attracted the Due’s notice, and in time espouses him. The French
arrive at Novara—the same regiment that had previously been seen at
Biella—and Capitaine Robert, his Tambour-Major, and a drum„mer
called G-riolet, are billetted on the Della Yoltas. In the midst the
betrothal festivities, the Tambour-Major recognises in the Duchess
his long lost wife, Margot, and subsequently discovers that Stella is
his child. The young girl, resolved at any price to avoid marriage
with Bambani, becomes a Vivandiere in her lover’s regiment, and the
curtain falls on the escape of the French officers, beset by the Italian
signors headed by Della Yolta.


ACT 111.
SCENE I.—A MOUNTAIN PASS NEAR MILAN.
In escaping from Novaro, the little French party get scattered..
Claudine and Robebt arrive safely at a lonely inn kept by an Italian
patriot, who shelters them, and presents them to a gathering of
peasants, who favour the French alliance against Austria. The others,
Tamboue-Majob, Gbiolet, and Stella, by sacking a carriage, and
disguising themselves in the travellers’ dresses, come also to the same
inn.
SCENE lI.—INTERIOR OF THE INN.
Here all the characters meet. The Duke arrives with the Duchess
in search of Stella, whom he has warned the patrols to arrest as a
French Vivandiere. Claudine has started for the French lines; and
intelligence being brought the Due that a Vivandiere has been arrested,
he jumps to the conclusion it is Stella, and orders the Duchess at
once to return to Milan and prepare for the marriage with Bambini.
Unfortunately, too, Robebt is recognised and arrested by the
Austrian Patrol, and all seems at an end for the lovers. However,
the others escape recognition, and manage to reach the French column,
then advancing on Milan, by the aid of a safe-conduct lent by the
Duchess.
SCENE lII.—THE ENTRY OF THE FRENCH INTO MILAN.
Bambini leads a veiled bride to the altar. Capitaine Robebt,
arriving under Austrian escort, tears the veil off, and discloses the
features of Claudine. The Due, furious at being tricked, is about to
proceed to extreme measures, when the French Avant-garde , with
colours flying pours into Milan, and all ends happily; Robebt re-
covering Stella, and Mabg-ot her long-lost Beenabd.

Here they are ! golden, russet, dapple,
Sunny and ripe from garden wall,
Nectarine, grape, and pear, and apple,

For in that circumstance is hidden
Much of the sweetness that may be ;
Only the fruit that is forbidden
Has any taste in the world for me !

Chorus. Has any taste, etc.

One thing we girls are all agreed in,
And well the fact is understood,
"Whether in school, or whether in Eden,
Fruit on the sly is very good !
What, tho’ found out, and roundly chidden,
Still will this thought our comfort be,

After dusty highway tramping,
Here’s a jolly spot for camping,
Pile our guns, unsling our pack,
Eor here we’ll bivouac !
Leave, the owner can’t be grudging,
To poor soldier weary trudging.
But in any case we stay,
Till close of the day ! [they stack arms.
Geio. Here we will rest safe from shell and slug.
Mont. What say you, Captain? Here are quarters
snug ?
Rob. Not bad! Here then let us recruit.
I scarce could march another foot!
Choeus. So many miles to-day we’ve marched,
Our limbs are tired, our tongues are parched.
« AIR.— HONOUR AND GLORY.”
Robeet.
“ Honour and glory,” “ Honour and glory,”
Motto we bear on our banners alway,
These words but tell the warrior’s story,
Erom the dim past unto our day !
And fierce the delight of the fire,
That breaks from the foe’s mighty host!
But the fire that I own I desire,
Is that of a friend with a mighty roast!
A crackling and sputtering roast!
Ha, ha! give me wine, give me meat!
Ha, ha; we must drink and must eat!
Ha, ha! ’tis a hard thing to say,
That heroes are but clay.

Not brigands, bandits, nor spadassins !
Stel. You are not then a cut-throat crew P
Chorus. We do not think so, miss, do you P
Stel. You do not murder, rob, or thieve ?
Chorus. We do not murder, rob, or thieve,
At least we do not so believe.
Rob. But tell, demurest little maiden,
If thee for Chatelaine we own ?
Stel. Oh, sir, lam with terror laden,
Because I’m left here all alone !
This is (just look about, sir,)
A school, not a chateau ;
My comrades have gone oul, sir,
And that is all I know !
And I am so frightened !
® oB> _ . Get along!
Frighten’d, eh ? And pray, Miss, why ?
You’ll pluck up courage, by-and-by.
Some people have of soldiers a terror,
And think their mission is to plunder, wound,
and slay.
But this, dear girl, ’s a popular error,
Which you must abjure from to-day.
Chorus. Which you must abjure from to-day.
Rob. The modern soldier surely made is,
To decorate, and not alarm a maiden’s bow’r.
To dangle after, woo the ladies,
Killing naught but the fleeting hour!
Chorus. Killing naught but the fleeting hour !
Stel. This is all so very new,
I scarcely well know what to answer!


But as I wish to think it true,
I’ll trust you with what heart I can, sir !
Bob. Bravo, bravo ! I think you’ll suit.
Moxt. She’ll make a very nice recruit.

On, on, to the lamb,

Bob. O Signorina, would you were,
Alway with us, to find sueh fare !
Stel. Yet one thing I forgot, I think
Men sometimes eat, but always drink.
G-allant sirs, now you might,
Tell me if I am right ?
Choeus. You are perfectly right!
Stel. I know where the Abbess keeps her wine!
Margaux, Volnay, Cliquot, Nierstein !

Cold as the Alp-snow in summer,

My hand is cold and clammy,
I can’t play “ Daddy Mammy!”

’Twixt me and my drum !
My heart is hollow like that instrument,
Oh wake, oh wake its tones again !
Grive it a beating, and I’ll be content,
Or drum and heart will crack in twain !

In my drum take I no pleasure,
Its soft tones upon my spirit pall;
If I would beat a gay measure,
It comes out as gay as the dead march in
Saul!


Yes, I have lost my metal,
For side drum or for kettle !
Why dost thou come,
’Twixt me and my drum ?

Stella.
I.
Italia ! Italia ! land of song and legend glorious,
Where’s thy laurel wreath of old P
Where the sword that once flashed thro’ all the
world victorious,
Where thy fanes, thy thrones of gold ?
Alas ! thy voice is silent now,
The laurel’s wither’d from thy brow ;
The line of Caesar turn’d to clay,
Thou own’st the House of Hapsburg’s sway !
Yet from the dust,
Awake ! and trust!
Beyond the hills,
And o’er the sea,
Beat hearts that burn to set thee free!
Tho’ now thou’rt dumb,
The day will come,
That thou wilt shout for Liberty !
Choeus. Beyond the hills, etc.

Stel. No high-priest now we have to read the fateful
omens,
Or to hail the victor home!


We are only “ Italians,” lost our name of

Oh still a spark lives in our veins,
Tho’ Italy long silence keep,

To do the honours to a whole brigade,
“ Ora pro me /”
And a military ball is not the rule,
I’m quite aware, at a boarding school!
“ Ora pro me /”
And yet my heart, I know not why,
Toward their colours seem’d to fly,
From drummer-boy to grenadier,
I welcom’d all, and felt no fear!
Ah, comrades, now ye march against the
foe,
Where honour guides you in the deadly
fray,
I may not forth to battle with you go,
But in my solitude for you I’ll pray!
Chokus. Now that we are marching, etc.


11.
Stel. I own, unholy notions have come
At sound of bugle and at tap of drum,
“ Ora pro me /”
And I’ve always thought creation’s plan
Is not complete if it wants a man,
“ Ora pro me!"
But if my heart e’er owns a lord,
He’ll wear, like them, a belt and sword !
I’ll husband else decline with thanks,
And fall, my friends, into the ranks !

Fall into line, and follow the drum !

Silence, prudence, let all be still!
Even your hearts must cease from beating,
If that be dark Austria’s will.
Let all be still, ay, still!
Clam. ( drawing dagger) Sec none in the forest are lurking,
If there be, why, give them a dirking !

No. 18. —TARANTELLA.—“BY CHANCE WE
HAD.”
Robert and CnoßUs.
.Rob. By chance we had our billet,
Within the Duke’s chateau,
When, so did bad luck will it,
WordS ran high —
Chorus. Ho, ho!


Rob. We would have left the dancing,
They would not let us go,
But whipt out sabres glancing,
And set on —
Chorus. Ho, ho!
Rob. But “ sans-culottes ” don’t care —
Chorus. Ho !
Rob. Bor either Duke or Duchess,
And so we did prepare —
Chorus. Ho !
Rob. To get out of their clutches.
I vow that marble hall —
Chorus. Ho !
Rob. Sapristi! we fought hard in,
Then reached the window all —
Chorus. Ho !
Rob. And drop’t into the garden !
We kept securely hiding,
Until the moon was low,
Then forth the ramparts gliding,
Here we came —
Chorus. Ho, ho!
Rob. Alas ! our hurry cost us
A penalty too dear !
Three of our friends have lost us,
Nor know that we are here !
Chorus. A penalty too dear, etc.
Rob. In vain we roamed your pine-clad mountains,.
Shouting the dear names all around,
The sighing wind, the plash of fountains,
Was all we heard of voice or sound.
Tired and footsore,
Tramp’d we upland dreary,
And, hungry and a-weary,
Came to a door.
Case of desperation,
No time for hesitation,
The host we did try.


“ The Austrians would catch us,
First dine us, then despatch us ! ”
Says he, “ Not I ! ” [_ pointing to Clampas.
Fob. And then he spoke in accents cheering,
“Our fare is rude; but our heart is true,
No Austrian, no foe be fearing,
You’ve bled for us, we’ll die for you !

No. 19.—SONGL—“THE LITTLE JEHU.”
Stella, G-riolet, Le Due, and Monthabor.
I.
Stel. I am a little Jehu, as you all may know,
My hat and wig, and coat and tops, are comme il
faut!
It was in Paris that to hold the ribbons I learn’d,
And many were the brougham and cab I overturn’d.
If there is anything that Frenchmen understand,
It is the art of driving four-in-hand
No one can turn the leaders round with such a grace,
So that they in their traces stare you in the face.
In such a very horsey school,
I learnt to drive on without rule.
Sides of the road were naught to me,
I went wherever I could see.
And never more, I say with pride,
Than twice in three times did collide !
Hi, there! Hillo ! halloo !
Where are you, stupid, driving to P
I am a little Jehu, etc.
Chorus. j a little Jehu, etc.
11.
Stel. At London once in the park called Hyde,
My driving was of such a kind,
All shouted, “ Here, you get inside,
And then you may pull down the blind !”


"What that might mean, I own, I did not quite
perceive,
But that it was a compliment I do believe !
Now, cab and shay, just clear the way !
Hi, there ! Hillo! Halloo !
Where, stupid, are you driving to ?
I am a little Jehu, etc.
Chortjs. | jjg 1 )!. j a little Jehu, etc.

Though our hearts wildly beating,
After sorrow and pain!
Yet again, once again, etc.
Rob. My own lost love! again I’m near her,
Now for the past fate doth atone!
Mont. Come, come !is that the way you cheer her ?
Embrace her, as if quite alone !
Rob. But then should Stella say me nay P
Stel. lam his child, and must obey ?
I’m dutiful, and must obey !
Grio. Less service I have seen than he,
But still I think I’d venture that!
Mont. ( to G-riolet) Take my advice and let it be,
Confine yourself to “rat-tat-tat !”
Stel. lam his child and must obey,
I’m dutiful, and must obey,
Rob. (to Stella) O dearest Stella, then I may ?

FEELING.”

Ducir. Oh, what a strange feeling came o’er me ;
My first husband stood there before me.
Mont. ( forgetting ) You were rather startled I know !
( remembering ) Peccavi ! Pro bono publico.
Ditch. This quite unexpected new comer
Was absurdly dressed up as a drummer !
Mont. ( forgetting ) How the deuce would you have me
dress’d then P
(remembering) In vino veritas> amen!
Ditch. At the sight of that drummer, that hat,
I own my heart went pit-a-pat!
Mont. Proceed ! I think we are getting on!
In coelo quies , et nem. con.
Duch. I confess it, my father,
Though me Duchess they call,
That my first love, though humble,
Is yet dearer than all!
Ensemble.
I may pain you and shock you,
But I would only mock you,
Were I not now to say,
I shall love him ever and aye!
Mont. My brain will almost totter !
’Tis very well my daughter !
And what you now say,
I will treasure ever and aye !
Duch. I’ve tried to forget my first vainly,
My second’s but old and ungainly !
Mont. {forgetting') He’s certainly very so-so !
{remembering) Mens sana in corpore sano !
Duch. My first he had seldom a penny,
But I’d welcome him now without any !
Mont, {forgetting) Yes, in pocket I was very low !
{remembering) Hum spiro spero proximo !


Duch. I was dazzled by rank and by show, ,
But ah! still my heart will say “ No!”
Mon. Hurrah! she is still one of us !
Aut Caesar, Madam, aut nullus !
Duch. I confess it, etc.

MUSIC STEALING-.”
Tutti and Chobus.

Upon the morning air?
A bridal chime is pealing,
For some young happy pair!
Yes, a marriage chime, etc.
Clam. ( mysteriously) Upon the breezes blowing,
Come tidings fair and free!
Chobus. Such tidings we’d be knowing,
And what the news may be!
Clam. To your ranks, Italians, rally,
French eagles nearer fly,
From scaur and wood and. valley,
The cry comes, “ They are nigh!”
Chobus. They’re welcome, thrice welcome !
Our gates we’ll ope!

I know it from my heart!


Clam. I’ll aid you if you’ll fly !
Hob, And from what ? From my love P
No, no ! I’d rather die !
Clam. If she be here, I know not where.
Rob. Hark, hark! hark ! What stirs the air ?
The bells ? ’Tis the bells !
[Church peal. The wedclinp procession enters.
Chobus. May their heav’n be pure as now,
May time passing lightly
O’er the maiden’s fair young brow,
Leave it shining brightly!
Duch. Now courage, Stella, we’ll soon be there!
Rob. He called her Stella! And, oh, despair !
Another claims her as his bride,
Whilst me they mock, and me deride !
Stop ! I say !
Chobus. Stop? and why?
Clam. He’s at bay!
Duch. {to Robebt) It is not Stella! Oh, I swear it!
Rob. This veil from her face I will tear it!

Claudine!
Claud. My stratagems are put to rout,
The plot is blown, the murder’s out.
Chobus. His head seems now in a perfect whirl,
He thought, no doubt, ’twas another girl!
Claud. Why must you in this matter come poking,
And land my scheme in such a mess ?
Ne’er I’ll have (it really is provoking)
Such chance to be a marchioness !
Due. Come, lug your pris’ner off now, guard,
And put him under watch and ward !
Chobus. No, No, you shall not drag him hence!
Rob. No use, my friends, vain your defence !
Due. There is no hope—
Duch. Yes, above!
Claud. Why so wildly act ?


Rob. ’Twas my love !
What is that ?
Chobus. What is that ?
Claud. ’Tis the tramp of marching feet!
Rob. And their drums proudly beat.
Ah yes, their drums now heat!
Chobus. And nearer!
