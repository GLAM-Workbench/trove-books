DEBATE
ON THE
MELBOURNE AND HOBSON?S BAY RAILWAY ACT
AMENDMENT BILL.
Tuesday, June 2nd, 1863.
The President took the chair at ten minutes past four o?clock, and
read the usual prayer.
MELBOURNE AND HOBSON?S BAY RAILWAY ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
�
Mr. STRACHAN moved the second reading- of this Bill. The
object of the measure, he observed, was to substitute for the word
? Crown,? in the 38th section of the Act incorporating- the Melbourne
and Hobson?s Bay Railway Company, the words ? Governor in Council.?
He might state, as a member of the old Legislative Council, that when
the Act was passed it was distinctly understood that the word ? Crown?
meant the Governor in Council. (?No, no.?) It would be for hon.
members to prove the reverse. But if it were not so understood, he
should like to know how the Company received the valuable lands and
powers which were given them ? They received them, not from the
Crown but from the Governor in Council. It appeared, however, that
the Company would take all they could from the Governor in Council,
and yet they were not prepared to comply with the terms of their
charter, and do what the Governor in Council asked them to do. The
38th section of the Act required the Company to erect all such bridges?
not less than seventeen feet in width?as might be deemed necessary
and might he required by the Crown, for the purpose of connecting any
land which might be severed by the railway. He maintained that the
Company received their charter on the understanding that the Governor
in Council had the pow'er to exercise the authority vested by the 38th
clause in the Crown. However, in 185 7, shortly after the passing of the
Act, some doubts arose on the subject; and in consequence of those
doubts, the Company had done nothing towards complying with the
38th clause. A Bill was afterwards-passed by both branches of the
Legislature, to the effect that the word ? Crown,? wherever it might


appear in any Colonial Act, should be taken to mean the ? Governor in
Council.? This Bill did not receive the sanction of the Imperial Govern-
ment, who considered that it might be made to embrace more than they
were prepared to concede; but they intimated that they thought it
would be better for the Colonial Parliament to amend their own acts.
He did not desire to comment upon the differences which had existed for
some time between the Railway Company on the one hand and the
people of Sandridg-e and Emerald Hill on the other. He went upon
the charter by which he held the Company to be bound. At the same
time, he could not shut his eyes to the fact that the people of Emerald
Hill and Sandridge had suffered great inconvenience from the action of
the Company. (?Oh, oh.?) No doubt the Company were afraid that
if they erected bridges they would facilitate road traffic between Sand-
ridge and Melbourne, and enable goods to be brought from Sandridge
pier by road at a much cheaper rate than they could be brought into
the city by railway. He believed the difference in cost would be some-
thing like one half, and thus there would be a saving to the public of
about �45,000 per year. Again, he maintained that the interests of the
14,000 people of Emerald Hill deserved some consideration. All, how-
ever, that was required from the Company w r as the making of a bridge
over the railway in a line with Clarendon-street, and the construction
of a crossing or tunnel at some other part of the line. These works
would not cost more that �15,000, and yet the Company objected to per-
form them, although the valuable property which they had received from
the country amounted in value to �200,000. (Mr. A?Beckett.?? It is
not worth �20,000.?) Well, whatever it might be worth, it was handed
over to the Company without any consideration whatever. Mr. Strachan
then proceeded to read a correspondence which took place between the
Government and the Emerald Hill Municipal Council, relative to the
non-compliance by the Company with the application made to them to
erect a bridge over their line, and in the course of which it appeared
that the Attorney-General of the day expressed his opinion that a clause
in a private Act which was inconvenient to the public might be repealed,
altered, or amended by a public Bill, and that the hon. and learned
gentleman subsequently undertook to prepare and introduce such a Bill.
However (said Mr. Strachan), after the Bill was drawn it was found
that some improvements were needed, and it was in waiting for these
improvements that the measure fell through. By almost every Govern-
ment the Company had been held responsible ; and it was his solemn
belief that the charter was obtained under the impression that the
Crown meant the Governor in Council. (?No, no?) Some of the hon.
members who said ?No? might not have been in the Legislative Council
at the time.
Mr. EAWKNER,?I was there.
Mr. a?BECKETT.? I was there.
Mr. MILLER.?And so was I.
Mr. STRACHAN would ask, if the Crown did not mean the
Governor in Council, under what authority did the Company hold the
land ?
Mr, MILLER,?The Crown gave them the land.
Mr. STRACHAN.?Then the Crown ought to insist on compliance
with the 88th section.


Mr. JENNER seconded the motion. The 38th clause of the Act of
Incorporation, he remarked, showed clearly enough that the Company
obtained their charter under the condition that they would build all the
bridges that were necessary. This he thought only reasonable. He
presumed other companies W'ere bound in the same way. The great
mistake appeared to have been in the insertion of the word u Crown,?
instead of ? Governor in Council but he was given to understand that
it was not the intention of the drawers of the Act that the word
? Crown? should mean the Imperial Government. (? Oh, oh.?) As far
as he could gather, the Company themselves did not think it had that
meaning at the time of the passing of the measure. (? Hear, hear,? and
u Oh, oh.?) If they thought so, why did they make overtures to the
people of Emerald Hill and Sandridge I ?why did they instruct their own
engineer to prepare a plan for a bridge in the line of Clarendon-street ?
(? Hear, hear.?) The Company did not object to receive from the
Governor in Council some very valuable allotments of land, both in
Flinders-street and at Sandridge; and why did they object to comply
with the conditions on which that land was granted ? The Bill now
before the House had passed the Legislative Assembly without a
division ? and his belief was that, if hon. members were not interested,
the Council would also pass the Bill without opposition. (? Oh,? from
Mr. Fawkner.) He might also mention that a committee of the Legis-
lative Assembly had gone fully into the case, and had decided in favor
of the Bill. And looking at the question on still broader grounds, he
would observe that the Hobson?s Bay Company charged 6s. 6d. per ton
for the lighterage of goods from the Bay (a laugh from Mr. A?Beckett),
and the subsequent cartage of g?oods to the stores was 2s. per ton,
making a total expense of Bs. 6d. per ton; whereas if a bridge were
thrown across the railway at Clarendon-street, goods could be broug?ht
from the ship to the city by road for 3s. 6d. -per ton, and thus there
would be a saving to the community of ss. per ton, representing a total
saving of �46,800 per annum. Now, ss. per ton on some things?such
as coals or pig iron?was a very handsome profit. He objected to the
Company wholly monopolising the land between the city and the Bay.
It was unfair, unjust, and unreasonable. If hon. members attended
merely to legislate for their own profit, and for their own purse, he was
prepared to throw out the Bill, But if they were met to legislate for
the good of the colony, as he presumed they were, they were bound to
support the measure. He should be sorry to create any ill-feeling, but
it appeared that some hon. members were deeply interested in this sub-
ject. He was surprised at it. (? Oh, oh,? and laughter.) But he felt
it his duty, as an independent member, to support the Bill.
Mr. A?BECKETT said he rose at this early period of the debate
because he was anxious that the House should clearly understand, at the
outset, the real facts of the case. The last speaker had shown a most
lamentable ignorance of them, and he was satisfied, from what he had
heard out of doors on the subject, that there was a general misappre-
hension as to the position of the Company in this dispute, and as to the
point to be decided by the Bill. The Bill was a most extraordinary
one, unparalleled in the history of legislation. It was an attempt to
alter, in a very material point, an Act under which nearly half a million


of capital had been invested, and this at the instance of a number of
interested individuals, who thought that thus they mig?ht be enabled to
impose upon the Hobson?s Bay Company the construction of works for
their benefit which the Act never contemplated. The Municipality of
Emerald Hill contended that, under the 38th clause of the Company?s Act,
the Shareholders were liable to be called upon to expend money to an un-
limited extent. Mr. A?Beckett proceeded to read extracts from the
evidence taken before the committee to show that, over and over again,
the people of Emerald Hill had asserted a right to call upon the Com-
pany to make bridges of any character they desired. One witness (Mr.
Gardiner) was asked whether he thought they could call upon the Com-
pany to make a bridge equal in character to Waterloo-bridge, and he at
once replied in the affirmative. Now, the 38th clause of the Company?s
Act merely required the Company to make such bridges as might from
time to time be considered necessary, and be required by the Crown ?not
for public traffic?not for the purpose of highways ?but for the purpose of
connecting lands which might be severed by the railway. The clause also
stated that each of such bridges should not be less than seventeen feet in
width. The Company had always been willing to make a bridge answering
to this description; and the real quarrel between the Emerald Hill
Municipality and the Company was, that the former had claimed a
bridge of a very different character. Not only had the Company been
willing to build a bridge seventeen feet wide, but they offered (in 1856)
to build a bridge twenty-four feet wide. But at that time there was no
road whatever on either side of the railway?there was then, as there is
now, a swamp on each side of it at the point called Clarendon-street,
which, although proclaimed as a street, had never been carried across
the swamp by the Municipality. The Company, therefore, submitted
that it would be absurd to build a bridge until the Municipality had
made the road to be used in connection with it. Captain Pasley, who
was at the time at the head of the Department of Land and Works,
saw this absurdity, and said it would be time enough to call upon
the Company to construct a bridge when there was a road leading
to it. The Municipal Council, finding that a bridge such as the Com-
pany were compellable by the Act to make was one that could not
serve their object, intimated that they would not insist upon a bridge
immediately if the Company would make a road for the Municipality
across the swamp. They informed the Company that they had agreed
to a resolution, to the effect that a level crossing over the railway in a
line with Clarendon-street would suit the requirements of the locality
for several years to come ; and if a road were made by the Company
across the swamp, the immediate demand for a bridge would not be in-
sisted upon. Now, what could be thought of the spirit of the Munici-
pality in urging upon the Government to call upon the Company to
make a bridge, which could not be required for ? years to come,? in
order to extort from the Company the making a road for the Munici-
pality which it was its duty to construct out of the rates ?to which
the Company, by-the-bye, were the largest contributors. And here he
would ask the hon. member who had charge of the Bill, if he had been a
shareholder of the Company, if he had invested money in the railway,
believing that the Company would only be called upon honestly and
fairly to perform the liability imposed upon it by the clause, whether he


would not have resisted an attempt to victimize the proprietary by the
agency of a Municipality, whose Parliamentary representative happened
to have a seat in the Ministry 1 The Emerald Hill Municipality at
that time contended, as they do even now contend, that they were en-
titled to demand, not a bridge seventeen feet wide, but of far wider
dimensions. That was the reason why the Emerald Hill Municipality
and the Hobson?s Bay Railway Company had been in conflict for years.
It was not because there had been an attempt on the part of the
Company to get rid of any liability which they might honestly be
subjected to under their Act, but because extortionate and oppressive
demands had been made upon them, which the Act could never bo
made to justify. It was very doubtful, however, whether any portion of
the line, as constructed, was within the meaning of the clause in ques-
tion. A clause, providing for the erection of occupation bridges, for
the convenience of private persons having land on each side of a cutting
in a line of railway, so as to connect the severed land, was usually
inserted in railway Bills. The Hobson?s Bay Railway was, however, on
a dead level, except in some places where there were small embank-
ments, but there were no cuttings on the line which would ? sever?
the lands, within the meaning of the clause, as he construed it. He
was quite certain that the intention of the clause was only that the
Company should connect land which had been severed by the line, so
as to make the erection of a bridge necessary to re-connect it; though
he admitted that it might be left to the Crown to decide whether a
bridge could or could not effect this. It might, he admitted, be difficult
to raise the question of necessity if the Crown required the bridge?it
might be said that the Court could not go behind the clause on this
point. He was confirmed in his opinion as to what was the real in-
tention of the clause by the evidence given when the Bill was pro-
moted in 1852. The Bill, as originally drafted, contained clauses giving
the Company power to purchase lands belonging to private persons ;
but the select committee to whom the Bill was referred remarked that
as the proposed line would not pass through any private property, there
was no need of these clauses. The reply was that they had been inserted
merely in order to make the provisions uniform with those of the Sydney
Railway Bill, and other Railway Bills, but on the suggestion of the
committee they were struck out; hut the 38th clause was left in, which
would only be applicable to lands in private occupation. The Com-
pany had never raised any question as to their liability to make a
bridge for private occupation if needed, or even if required hona -fide by
the Crown. The Emerald Hill Municipality, however, had been the
moving power throughout, and had been most exacting in its demands.
The object of this Bill was, no doubt, practically to transfer the power
committed to the Crown?who would exercise it fairly as between the
public and the Company?to the Municipality of Emerald Hill, who
would use it unjustly and oppressively. The hon. member proceeded
to read some extracts from the evidence given by Mr. Gardiner and
Mr. Thistlethwaite, members of the Municipality, one of whom said, in
reply to questions by the committee, that he thought it would be expe-
dient to have more than one bridge over the railway; and when asked
why the Emerald Hill Council had not demanded more, he replied, ? We
have a little bit of conscience.? (Laughter.) The evidence also proved


that the estimate of the cost of a bridge formed by one of the Municipal
Council witnesses was �22,000, and the estimate of the cost of a bridge
of a different construction, formed by another councillor, was �99,000.
The Municipality was constantly calling upon the Company to make
bridges of a character far exceeding any liability which the Act imposed
upon them, and hounding on the public against the Company, on the
ground that they were unjust monopolists, and had obtained immense
advantages. It had been alleged that the present Act would be unwork-
able if unaltered, but this he most positively denied. It was true that
the power could not be exercised by the Governor in Council, but it
could be exercised by the Governor, acting under a commission of the
Crown, and before such a tribunal the Company would, no doubt, be
fairly heard, and by it be fairly treated. The Municipality of Emerald
Hill had, however, all along vexatiously harassed the Company. They
had insisted that the Governor had nothing to do with the question, and
that the Executive Council ought to determine it. The Company felt
that it would be most unjust to place the power in the hands of the
Executive Council, comprising as it did the Parliamentary representative
of Emerald Hill; and they, therefore, raised the question before the
Supreme Court. It had been alleged that the objections urged by the
Company were in violation of the promise given by the Directors that
they would take no technical objections; but this was not a technical
objection?it was a substantial one?and they had distinctly instructed
their counsel not to take any technical objection. The whole object of
the Bill was to transfer the power which the Act conferred on the Crown
to the Municipality of Emerald Hill. It was idle to say that the Muni-
cipality of Emerald Hill would have nothing to do with the matter,
for they had been the movers in the agitation throughout. At the
time the Act was passed the Municipality of Emerald Hill was
not in existence; and was improbable, he would ask, that the Com-
pany would ever have consented to the 38th clause if they had sup-
posed for a moment that the power of enforcing it would be prac-
tically transferred from the Crown to a Municipality ? It had
been said that the Company had shown a disposition to impede the traffic
between Melbourne and Emerald Hill, but the reverse was the case.
The Company had always facilitated the traffic between Emerald Hill and
Melbourne in every possible way, even to their own detriment. They had
allowed three gangways to be constructed across their line for the accom-
modation of foot passengers. The Company had also voluntarily paid men
to watch them; and thousands of foot passengers passed over them
weekly ? and also offered to build a substantial bridge across the line for
foot passengers, to prevent the possibility of accidents happening in
future?yet, when an accident occurred the other day, the Emerald Hill
Council refused to be at any expense in making the approaches to it,
although they had been informed by the Directors that they had not
power to expend the capital of the Company upon works beyond their
own boundary line. This would show the spirit with which the Council
was actuated. The first demand made by the Municipality was that
the Company should make a bridge, which they admitted would not be
necessary for years to come. Afterwards the Company required
powers to make a new bridge for their line across the Yarra, and a
deviation line, and the Municipality then interposed, making demands


for additional accommodation. A conference took place between the
representatives of the Municipality and the Company; the result ot
which was that an opening l was left, by a culvert, under the new devia-
tion line for the purposes of the traffic between Melbourne and Emerald
Hill. As it was then contemplated to have a bridge across the Falls,
the line was so constructed that the culvert might be used in connection
with the bridge when erected. Everything was amicably settled, and the
culvert was made; and then Mr. Service, who was one of the represen-
tatives of Emerald Hill, and a member of the Government, insisted that
the bridge should be carried across the Falls, and across the line by
a level crossing, and he expressed his determination to press this
quite regardless of all remonstrances. The Company gave him notice
that he would be opposed, but he persevered, and actually began
to carry out his embankment upon the line when the Company
stopped his work in a summary manner. He then went to the
law officers, and they informed him that he was wrong, and that he had
no right to cross the line. The present Bill was then brought in by
him two years and a half ago, and it had been altered three times.
In the first instance it was a Bill to compel the Company to allow Mi*.
Service to go on with his level crossing. This was shown to be
improper by their own witnesses, and then it was altered so as to
compel the Company to build a bridge forty feet wide; and to justify
this demand the promoters tried to make out that the culvert, made
at the instance of the Municipality, was nothing more than a ti-ap, and was
utterly useless. By observation, however, many of the sensible inhabi-
tants of Emerald Hill became satisfied that the culvert was capable of
being used for traffic; and he found that on the 16th of last month
eight carts, twenty carriages, seventy-six drays, and a number of other
vehicles, and saddle horses, passed through it. He admitted that the
culvert was capable of improvement, but it was perfectly dry, the Com-
pany having gone to the expense of draining it, and the lieight of it
might be increased from Bft. Gin. to 10ft. at a moderate expense. It
would then afford sufficient accommodation for all the traffic between
Melbourne and Emerald Hill.
The PRESIDENT here read a message from the Legislative
Assembly, transmitting the plans deposited by the Melbourne and
Hobson?s Bay Company at the Office of the Board of Land and Wox-ks,
and the production of which had been asked for by a resolution of the
Council. He laid the plans on the table.
Mr. A?BECKETT said that the plans had aiTived most opportunely,
as they verified what he had just said about the willingness of the Com-
pany to make a bridge in accordance with the requirements of the Act;
there was the plan of the very bridge he had been referring to, and which
Mr. Nimrno, the town-surveyor of Emex-ald Hill, stated in his evidence
that the Municipality had ? scouted;? it also established the correctness
of his statement as to the culvert, and proved that it had been constructed
exactly in accordance with the wishes of the Emerald Hill Municipality,
after several negociations with the Company. If the Municipality would
join in the expense of inci?easing the height of the culvert it could be
easily done. In addition to making- this culvert, the Company had
also allowed the public to have gangways over the line, and there
was a level crossing at Ingles-street, which was a nearer route for


persons walking- between Sandridg-e and Melbourne than a bridg-e at
Clarendon-street would be. One of the objects of the Municipality
in trying-to get a bridge at Clarendon-street was evidently to obtain an
instalment towards a high-level bridge to cross the river in a line with
Spencer-street, on the other side, for communication with Spencer-street,
for that street was always mentioned by the Municipality in con-
nection with this subject. He had now addressed the House at some
length, and he would, therefore, not trespass longer upon their attention.
There were other points which he had wished to bring under their notice,
but they would, no doubt, be pointed out by hon. members who would
follow him. He thought he had said sufficient to show that the object
of the Bill was, not for the honafide purpose of compelling the Company
to fulfil a just liability, but to enable a body of men, who had all along-
been most vexatious and exacting in their demands, to compel the Com-
pany to incur a large expenditure in doing work for the Munici-
pality, which ought to be executed out of its own rates ?to which
the Company were the largest contributors. The liability under the 38th
clause at the time that the Act was passed, was then estimated, as appears
by the evidence given before the committee upon the Bill, at �2,000 ; this
it was thought would be amplysufficient, but the Council of Emerald Hill
would compel them to incur an unlimited expenditure. He would appeal to
hon. members whether it was just to those persons who had invested
their capital in the Company to make the proposed important alteration
in the Act ? He was sure that if the Bill were passed, the shareholders
both in the colony and in England would be most indignant at the
manner in which they had been treated, and would petition Her Majesty
to withhold the Royal assent to the measure. The hon. member con-
cluded by moving that the Bill be read a second time that day six
months.
Mr. HTGHETT, in seconding the amendment, expressed his con-
viction that it would be a great breach of faith towards the persons who
had invested their capital in the Company if the Bill were passed with-
out their consent. Many of the shareholders had told him that they took
shares in the undertaking expressly under the impression that they were
protected by the word ? Crown,? and that the word ? Crown? inferred
the Governor personally, and not the Governor in Council. He was
satisfied that the word ? Crown? was designedly introduced, and the
57th clause proved that such was the case, for a distinction was there
drawn between the ? Crown? and the colonial ? Government.? Besides
the Shareholders, the bondholders ought to be considered. The Com-
pany owed �IOO,OOO on bonds, nearly the whole of which were held by
capitalists in England. They lent their money on the faith of the Act,
and they had had no opportunity of opposing the Bill which had now
been introduced. It was proposed to take away their rights without
giving them an opportunity of being heard on the subject. Such a
thing was monstrous and unparalleled, and he felt confident that the
Royal assent would not be given to the measure. Even if it became
law, it could never be carried into effect, for it would enable the Emerald
Hill Council to require the Company to spend any amount of money
they chose, and if they had such a power the Company had no funds
with which to incur the expenditure.
Mr. EELLOWS remarked that the language of the general Railway


Act, in operation in England, clearly showed that this Bill proposed to
throw upon the Melbourne and Hobson?s Bay Company a duty which
was never contemplated by the original enactment. It had been argued
that the word ? Crown,? in the 38th section, was intended to read the
? Governor in Council,? but this could not have been the case, because the
word ?Crown? and the term ? Executive Government of Victoria,? were
both used in the preceding clause. The 38th section required the Rail-
way Company to make all necessary bridges, not for connecting public
roads, but ? for the purpose of connecting any land severed by the rail-
way from the land from whence the same shall have been severed.?
Now, what was the interpretation which the English Legislature would
put upon these words ? In the general English Railway Act there was
a set of provisions requiring the companies to provide bridges, &c., for
the convenience of private individuals through whose land the railways
passed j and another set of clauses requiring the companies to make
approaches to connect the public roads through which the lines passed.
The language of the clauses which referred to the cases in which private
property was cut through, was to the effect that the companies should
be required to make such bridges as should be necessary ? for the pur-
pose of making good any interruption caused by the railway to the use
of the lands through which the railway shall be formed.? This was pre-
cisely similar language to that employed in the 38th clause of the Mel-
bourne and Hobson?s Bay Company?s Act; and it was quite clear that it
was never contemplated that the Company should make bridges for the
public accommodation. This was also evident from the terms of the Crown
grant, which expressly reserved ? so much of the said land as may hereafter
be required for making public ways.? If the 38th clause were intended to
give the Government power to order the Company to make a bridge
wherever it pleased, there would have been no necessity for these words in
the Crown grant. The clause, however, was only intended to require
the Company to form bridges which might be necessary to connect the
land belonging to private individuals on each side of the line after it had
been alienated from the Crown, and the Legislature had no right to alter
it. Although an Act of Parliament, this was nothing more than a con-
tract, and it would destroy all security in colonial investments if the
Legislature were to cancel a contract simply because it was considered by
some people that the State had made a bad bargain.
Mr. HERVEY was of opinion that there ought to be some authority
to set the Crown in motion to compel the Company to carry out its
liabilities under the 38th clause, and upon that ground he supported the
Bill. The House had no right to presume that that power would be
abused. (Mr. Fawkner. ?? Oh, oh.?) The hon. member expressed an
opinion that members who were Shareholders in the Company were not
entitled to vote, in support of which he quoted two cases in which
decisions had been given in the House of Lords and in the House of
Commons, to the effect that an hon. member had no right to vote for
a Bill the passing of which would forward his pecuniary interest.
Mr. FELLOWS intimated that a member was not debarred from
voting against a Bill which would interfere with his pecuniary interest.
The PRESIDENT remarked that the point of order had not yet
been raised.
Mr. FAWKNER suggested that'the debate should be adjourned.


Mr. STRACHAN would prefer the vote being? taken at once. He
thought that sufficient time had been occupied in the discussion.
Mr. FAWKNER moved that the debate be adjourned until next day.
The motion was agreed to.
Wednesday, June 3rd,
The President took the chair at ten minutes past four o?clock, and
read the usual prayer.
MELBOURNE AND HOBSON?S BAY RAILWAY ACT AMENDMENT BILL.
The other orders of the day having been postponed, to give precedence
to the adjourned debate on the second reading of this Bill, the debate
was resumed by
Mr. FAWKNER, who supported the amendment, that the Bill be
read a second time that day six m nths. He remembered the railway
being projected, and he took fifteen shares in the undertaking himself.
At that time the dwellings at Emerald Hill and Sandridge consisted only
of a tew huts, and the shipping interest was greatly damaged in conse-
quence of the goods being detained for along time in port, owing to the
want of railway accommodation. He would not have invested a shilling
in the undertaking if he had believed that the word ? Crown? in the
38th clause of the Company?s Act meant the ? Governor in Council,?
and he knew many other shareholders who would not have done so. In
fact, the Shareholders generally had invested their money in the concern
on the faith of the contract that the powers of the clause would be under
the control of the Crown and not of a shifting Ministry, called a
? Responsible Government,? though their responsibility was all moon-
shine. He admitted that the Company were bound to make a bridge of
the kind specified in the Act, if it were necessary, but the demands of
the Emerald Hill Municipality were most unjust and oppressive. It was
never contemplated that the Company should be required to make bridges
and roads for the convenience of the whole of the community which
might spring up on either side of the line. He maintained that the
people of Emerald Hill had no right to interfere, and that if any com-
munity had a right to complain it was the people of Sandridge, who had
not interfered in any way. About half a million of money had been
expended in the undertaking, and a great number of the
shares had been subscribed by British capitalists, who had also advanced
nearly the whole of the money which the Company had borrowed. For
some years past he had ceased to have any interest whatever in the
undertaking, but he felt it was most important that the Legislature
should keep faith with those who had invested their money in any of the
public works of the colony. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. HULL thought that the fact that the first Bill sent home to
strike out the word ? Crown? did not receive the Royal assent, was a
clear proof of the feeling of the Imperial Government as to the meaning
of the word. If the home Government had been of opinion that the
words ? Crown? and ? Governor in Council? were synonymous, they would
not have advised Her Majesty to refuse her assent to the Bill. As
bearing upon the question, he might quote an extract from a despatch


in reference to the New Constitution, written by the Duke of Newcastle
to Lieutenant-Governor La Trobe, in December, 1852 ; -r? Referring to
the more important question involved in this last head of the grievances
stated in the petition?namely, the demand for the exemption of legis-
lative enactments of strictly local character from the disallowing power
of the Crown?Her Majesty?s Ministers have no indisposition to meet
the views of the Council if any practical mode can be devised of distin-
guishing local from Imperial subjects of legislation; and Her
Majesty?s Ministers must add, that under the present mode of exercising
tiie Royal prerogative in this behalf, the grievance complained of is,
in their opinion, rather theoretical than practical.? The hon. member
concluded by stating that he should vote for the amendment.
Mr. PO\VER was not convinced that it was the duty of the House
to reject the Bill. He agreed with those opponents of the measure who
said that the only question at issue was a question of contract; and he
would ask how had the parties to the contract carried out their engage-
ments ? The Crown had fulfilled all its share of the contract, but had
the railway Company done so ] (? Yes.?) If the Company had fulfilled
their obligations, why did they not rest their case upon that plea?
(Mr. A?Beckett. ??We do.?) They did not rely upon that plea, but
they raised a false issue, that the ? Crown? did not mean the ? Governor
in Council.? The Crown could only be put in motion by the Legislature,
and if the Company were required to do more than their contract obliged
them to do, they could obtain redress in the Supreme Court. It had
been alleged that the Company had no funds to do the work which was
required, and that it would be ruined. This, however, was not a ques-
tion for the House to consider. All that they had to do was to see that
the contract was enforced, and he hoped hon. members would act
independently.
Mr. CAMPBELL was a shareholder in the Company, and, there-
fore, perhaps, debarred from voting on the question (? No, no?), hut
he felt it his duty to express the views which he held. He denied that
the Company had failed to cany out any portion of its contract. If
there were any obligation unfulfilled after the completion of the line, it
was the duty of the Crown to have stepped in and told the Company to
make any bridge which was required. This, however, was not done, but
an inspector was sent to inspect the line, and he approved of it. The
Company had raised and borrowed all the money which the Legislature
had authorised them to obtain, so that if they were called upon to expend
a large sum of money in making the bridges which it was sought to
compel them to make, they would have no funds with which to construct
them.
Mr. COLE also supported the amendment, and remarked that if the
Crown was aggrieved by any neglect on the part of the Railway Com-
pany, the Crown ought to have brought in this Bill. He blamed the
Crown for allowing the Company to construct their deviation line with-
out requiring them to build a bridge over the Falls; but he considered
it unjust to punish the Company for this neglect on the part of the
Crown.
Mr, FRASER believed that the railway had been an immense bene-
fit ; and he urged that, while it was .the duty of the Legislature to pro-
tect the public interests, it was bound also to see that private interests

were not neglected. The effect of the Bill would be to harass the Com-
pany improperly, and he would therefore vote for the amendment.
Mr. STRACHAN characterised the objections to the Bill as most
extraordinary. Hon. members had regarded it as a question between
the Railway Company and the Municipality of Emerald Hill; but that
was not a proper view to take of it. The object of the Bill was simply
to compel the Company to fulfil their obligations, and that was the sole
reason why he supported it. It was unfair to talk of the Bill being'
calculated to ruin the Company, and of the shares being depreciated.
Why, at one time the shares were up at f 100. He considered that the
Company had not met the Bill fairly and honestly, and that if the
measure were rejected they would snap their fingers at the public.
The House then divided, and the numbers were :

The President was about to announce the result, when
Mr. STRACHAN said he should like to ask whether Mr. Degraves
was directly or indirectly interested in the Melbourne and Hobson?s Bay
Railway Company ?
Mr. DEGRAVES.?I am a Shareholder.
Mr. A?BECKETT. ?I am also a Shareholder.
Mr. HIGHETT.?And lam a Shareholder.
Mr. STRACHAN moved that the vote of Mr. Degraves be dis-
allowed.
Mr. WILLIAMS seconded the motion.
Mr. A?BECKETT observed that the Bill was of so unprecedented
a character that no precedent as to voting upon such a Bill could be
found. It was a measure opposed by persons, not to promote their own
interests, but to protect their rights created under an Act of Incorporation
upon the strength of which they had invested their capital. The whole
case, moreover, of the promoters of the Bill went on the assumption
that the passing of the measure would add nothing to the liabilities of
the Company?that it did not impose upon the Company any
responsibility which had not hitherto existed, and therefore it did
not lie in them to say that the Shareholders had a direct pecuniary
interest in opposing it. The despatch read to the House the previous
day had suggested that such a Bill should be a public Bill; and if the
measure were taken as a matter of public policy, Shareholders of the


Company were clearly entitled to vote. The measure, however, had been
brought forward as a private Bill, probably because it was thought in
this form it would have the etfect of excluding from voting those who
might be supposed to be opposed to it. He might mention that, when
the Bill was first introduced to the other branch of the Legislature,
Mr. Service, one of the promoters of the Bill, and a subscriber towards
the expenses of the measure, not only was allowed to vote, but was
Chairman of the Committee to which the Bill was referred.
Mr. FELLOWS said he understood the rule to he that a person
interested was not entitled to vote in favour of such a Bill. There was
a case before the House of Commons of a shareholder?s vote being
challenged on account of pecuniary interest, but as the vote was only
given in opposition it was allowed.
Mr. STRACHAN asked the ruling of the President as to whether
a Shareholder was eligible to vote or not ?
The PRESIDENT.?To determine the point of order as to the
exclusion of votes, the House will distinguish between public and
private Bills, for I know of no instance in which a vote has been dis-
allowed on any question of public policy. It has been suggested that
the present Bill should be regarded as a public Bill; but there is
nothing in the Bill itself, or in the manner of its introduction, to
warrant such an opinion. It has been twice introduced as a private
Bill; and its prime and only provision?viz., to substitute for the word
?Crown? the words ?Governor in Council??is restricted in its
operation to the Melbourne and Hobson?s Bay Railway Company. No
privilege, therefore, of voting can be claimed on the ground of its being
a public Bill. Several of the decisions in the Commons? journals show
that it is not sufficient to disqualify a member from voting on a
particular question that he belongs to a rival Company; and that a
man, although disqualified from voting for a question, may nevertheless
vote ag?ainst it. This rule does not, I think, correctly state the
principle of such decisions. The great fundamental rule is, that no
member who has a direct pecuniary interest in a question shall be
allowed to vote upon it. Applying this rule to the present case, it
may be alleged that neither the Melbourne and Hobson?s Bay Railway
Company nor the Emerald Hill Municipality have a direct interest in
the present Bill, because it may not certainly be presumed that the
discretion proposed to be transferred from the Crown to the Governor
in Council will be exercised for or against either one or the other of the
contending parties, consequently that the interest is contingent and not
direct. I think the House, however, will agree witn me that this is a
very technical view of the case. There can be no question, from the
evidence which has been laid before this House, that the promoters of
the Bill seek the intervention of the Legislature judicially, in order to
compel the Melbourne and Hobson?s Bay Railway Company to execute
certain works which have been respectively estimated by the two parties
at ,�;),000 and �15,000. In other words, the promoters of the Bill and
their antagonists stand in the relation of plaintiffs and defendants to
each other, and are therefore substantially, if not directly interested in
the question. For these rsasons, lam of opinion that no Shareholder of
the Company nor member of the. Municipality should vote on the
present question.
