ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
The compilation of this Dictionary of Colour
Standards has been considerably facilitated by the
willing co-operation of various Government Depart-
ments, Trade and Scientific Associations, and a large
number of individuals engaged in the colour using
industries. Without this assistance the information
respecting colours would not have been authoritative.
The British Colour Council hereby acknowledges
its deep appreciation of the valuable assistance
received from all the authorities with whom it has
consulted.
COLOUR OF CLOTH COVER.
The colour of the cloth used for the cover of the
Card, Dictionary and Case is Caledon Jade Green.
This dyestuff has been chosen since it is acknow-
ledged to be the outstanding discovery of the British
Dyestuffs Industry.




FOREWORD
It is with a sense of gratification that I write the
foreword to this production.
Soon after the incorporation of the British
Colour Council, it became evident that there should
be available for reference an authoritative range of
standard colours as the first essential step to the
substitution of order for the existing chaos in colour
definition.
The Council, therefore, set up a Technical
Committee, consisting of Mr. C. J. T. Cronshaw,
Mr. C. B. Gwynn, Mr. F. J. Farrell, and Mr. C. M.
Whittaker, to assist Mr. Wilson, the Manager of
the Council, in the compilation of this range.
It is well known that no colour in nature is
constant, but varies according to season and intensity
of light. Moreover, close examination of natural
colours reveals that they are rarely uniform; again,
the sensitivity of the human eye varies widely;
indeed, a certain proportion of people suffer from
varying degrees of colour blindness. Under these
conditions the British Colour Council do not expect
that the standards adopted by it will be altogether
immune from criticism, nor that its range of colours
will be completely acceptable. At the same time,
the many examples examined have been most care-
fully matched, and reference has been made in all
cases to well-recognised authorities.


The Dictionary of Colour Names, which is issued
with the Range of Colours, should be a valuable book
of reference, containing the history and derivation
of many names with explanatory notes.
It is my belief that the publication of the
Dictionary of Colour Standards, which is the first
in the British Empire, must become one of the most
important reference works of its kind.
H. Sutcliffe Smith.
President, British Colour Council,
1932-1934.

Buffalo name derived from Buffalo,
Yellow Ochre through the Italian Bufalo.
From the Greek boubalos (the

Many varieties of Buffs are used

often with such adjectives as

CALAMINE BLUE B.C.C. 163, Calamine, is a zinc
ore found in England, and the
colour here given was featured
under the same name in
Rid.


CAMBRIDGE BLUE B.C.C. 191. This " Light Blue ”
of the English University has
from time to time caused some
controversy. Cambridge Blue
is supposed to be the same as
Eton Blue, the latter dating
from the fifteenth century, and
being adopted by Cambridge in
1836.
The story goes that an old
Etonian of the Cambridge crew
in the boat race of 1836
supplied the distinguishing
colour which was carried by
the cox, and the colour was
adopted as a permanent colour
for the University Boat Club.
Probably some surprise will be
occasioned by the colour here
featured as Cambridge Blue,
but it is matched to the coloured
material supplied by the Univer-
sity outfitters and the Secretary
of the Cambridge Boat Club,
1934, as supplied to and worn
by rowing " Blues.”
CANARY YELLOW see B.C.C. 112, Sulphur.
CAPUCINE (Fr.) see B.C.C. 96, Nasturtium.
CARDINAL B.C.C. 186. An old colour name
used in the seventeenth century,
probably originating from the
colour of the robes worn by
the high dignitaries of the
Church. T.C.C.A. standard
colour similar. T.C.C.A. Dark
Cardinal, similar to B.C.C. 37,
Peony Red. Similar to 8.5.1.
Crimson.
CARMINE see B.C.C. 37, Peony Red.
Carmine Lake The term Carmine is derived
Chinese Lake from the French or Spanish
Florentine Lake carmin, derived from the medi-
Hamhurg Lake aeval Latin cremesinus, varia-
Lake tions of which, in kermesinus,
Munich Lake carmeminus, gave rise to Crim-
Roman Lake son and Carmine.


CARMINE (Contd.) Originally, and for some time, it
Venetian Lake meant solely a bluish red dye
Vienna Lake derived from the kermes insect,
which was also the source of
the original scarlet dye. After
the discovery of cochineal, the
dye was taken entirely from
that source. Coal tar products
have generally taken the place
of genuine carmine (which is
very fugitive), and several of
these synthetic products com-
bine permanency with the rich-
ness of Carmine.
See also notes on Cochineal.
CARMINE LAKE B.C.C. 37, Peony Red, and
notes on Carmine.
CARNATION see B.C.C. 35, Neyron Rose.
Neyron Rose Carnation means rosy pink colour,
from the Latin carneus (flesh
colour), and was used in Eng-
land as early as 1535 in this
sense.
The flower name may have
originally been " Coronation ”
(indented like a coronet).
The use of the term Carnation as
a name referring to the colour
of the cultivated flowers is very
recent; as there is such a
tremendous variety of these
flowers having different colours,
it is impracticable to allot a
single colour to this name.
CARROT B.C.C. 144. Carefully matched to
the centre core of young carrots.
CASTILIAN RED T.C.C.A. standard colour. See
B.C.C. 185, Cherry.
CEDAR GREEN B.C.C. 80. Matched to the foliage
of the tree of that name.
Similar to 8.5.1. Deep Bronze
Green. Rep.
CELESTE (Fr.) see B.C.C. 162, Sky Blue.
CELESTIAL see B.C.C. 162, Sky Blue.
CERAMIC see B.C.C. 85, Adonis Blue.
CERISE (Fr.) see B.C.C. 185. Fr. for Cherry.


CERULEAN see B.C.C. 162, Sky Blue. Since
the sixteenth century Cerulean
(from Latin cceruleus, blue,
itself from calum, sky) has been
the literary term for Sky Blue.
In 1859 the name Cerulean
was given to a pigment, but is
recognised amongst artists as
indicating a certain chemical
colour matter. Cerulean Blue
varies so much that it is im-
practicable to standardise it at
the present time, but the name
Cerulean should only be alloted
to Sky Blue, B.C.C. 162.
CHAMPAGNE B.C.C. 4. A comparatively new
colour name. From the wine
and general representation of
samples submitted by Textile
and other Colour Using Indus-
tries. Leghorn of T.C.C.A.
similar.
CHAMPIGNON (Fr.) see B.C.C. 181, Mushroom.
CHARTREUSE GREEN ...... B.C.C. 171. Matched to the
liqueur, and also representative
of an average of samples sub-
mitted by Textile and other
Colour Using Industries.
CHARTREUSE YELLOW B.C.C. 75. Matched to the
Linden Green liqueur, and also representative
Vert Tilleul (Fr.) of an average of samples sub-
mitted by Textile and other
Colour Using Industries.
CHASSEUR (Fr.) see B.C.C. 26, Tartan Green.
CHERRY B.C.C. 185. There is considerable
Cerise (Fr.) confusion with regard to this
Spectrum Red colour name, and many colours
appear thus named. Moreover,
it is confused with the French
word for cherry, cerise. The
same colour sensation should be
used for both these names, and
the one here featured is matched
to the English red cherry, as
well as being the average of a
number of samples submitted
by Textile and other Colour
Using Industries. Similar to
T.C.C.A. Castillian Red.


CHESTNUT B.C.C. 60.
CHILLI B.C.C. 98. Matched to the dried
Chinese Vermillion pods of capsicum known as
Pimento Chillis.
CHINESE BLUE see B.C.C. 89, Lido, and notes
on Cyanine Blue.
CHINESE LAKE see B.C.C. 37, Peony Red, and
notes on Carmine.

CLARET B.C.C. 36. The truth concerning
Bordeaux this colour is generally mis-
Crimson Lake understood.
Wine The word Claret is only used in
English, and does not appear to
any appreciable extent in other
languages.
It was derived from the Old
French clairet, a diminutive of
clair (light, clear), and was
originally used only as attached
to the word vin to distinguish
wines of yellowish or light red
colour.
The term Bordeaux and Claret
have been so closely associated
for hundreds of years that the
former name has been used as
frequently as Claret, meaning
the wines made in the valley of
Gironde, and shipped from
Bordeaux. Therefore, the names
Claret and Bordeaux should
refer to the same colour.

COCHINEAL Is obtained from the female
insects, Coccus cacti, but its use
has been considerably restricted
for dyeing textiles since the
introduction of the synthetic
azo scarlets. At one time all
the scarlet uniforms of the

ECru B.C.C. 63. There is considerable
Beige confusion concerning the colour
Grege names of Ecru, Beige, and
Grege.
They are all French, and mean
exactly the same thing—the
colour or the condition of cloth
in its raw, unbleached state.
Ecru is simply composed of e and
Cm, from the Latin crudus, raw,
crude. Beige is derived from
an old dialectal form hie-beges,
meaning grey. Originally both
these names were technical dye-
house terms, and their use as
fashion colour names dates only
from the latter half of the nine-
teenth century. Although still
used considerably, especially in
certain sections of industry, the
name Ecru has gradually lapsed
since 1910 as a fashion name,
being superceded by Beige,
while Grege is now coming
into favour.
With little idea of what the words
mean, most people believe that
they refer to different colours.
Ecru refers to unbleached cloth
of any kind, silk, cotton, wool,
or linen. Beige was long used
in French dyehouses to refer to
unbleached woollen cloth, while
the meaning of Grege is raw
(of silk).
It will be readily understood that
various batches of unbleached
woollen goods will exhibit
variations in colour, and there-
fore the colour here featured is
a general representation of
many examples of unbleached
materials and also materials
dyed to this colour name.
This standard also represents
Beige and Grege. Where the
word Beige is used on this
colour card to designate a
colour, a qualifying name is
added to give a definite stand-
ard, e.g., Rose Beige.

and is the general representa-
tion of samples submitted under
this name by Textile and other
Colour Using Industries.


It must be remembered that prior
to the twentieth century Carna-
tion always meant Flesh Colour,
being derived from Latin
carneus (flesh colour), and was
used in England before the
middle of the sixteenth century.
Flesh Pink is used as a colour
name to distinguish those

GOLD - B.C.C. 114. There is considerable
confusion with regard to this
colour, and interpretations range
over the whole of the warm end
of the spectrum. It is probably
owing to its being a metal that
we see so many variations,
inasmuch as the slightest change
in the angle at which a piece
of gold is seen will give a
different colour sensation. More-
over, the association of the two
words Gold and Yellow is so
close that the average mind
instinctively connects the two.
A piece of gold having no
reflected light would be near
t© Old Gold B.C.C. 115, but if
illuminated it would become
the colour here given. This is
also the general representation

HERALDIC COLOURS The tinctures used for emblazon-
ing Heraldic arms comprise two
metals, five colours, and eight
furs.
Of these, the metals and colours
only are of interest in this
dictionary.


The metals are as follows:
Argent Silver.
Or ...... Gold. See B.C.C. 114, Gold.
The colours:
Azure Blue, from Old French azur, from
Mediaeval Latin azure. See
B.C.C. 196, Larkspur.
Gules Red. Possibly Hebrew gulude, a
piece of red cloth, or Arabic
gule, a red rose. See B.C.C. 97,
Poppy.
Sable ...... Black. The word sable of French
origin, used largely in Mediaeval
English to mean black, gloomy,
thence, poetically, dusky, dread,
etc.
Vert Green. French, from Latin viridis,
green. See B.C.C. 22, Apple.
Purpure Purple, from Latin purpura. See
B.C.C. 29, Plum.
Two other colour names are used less frequently:
Murrey See B.C.C. 135, Murrey.
Also referred to as Sanguine, dark
crimson red, the colour of blood.
Murrey, from Old French more,
Mediaeval Latin moratus (mour-
ter, mulberry).
Tenne see B.C.C, 73, Mace. Also re-
ferred to as Tawney or Brick,
an orange version of Tan.
These heraldic terms date from
the early thirteenth century,
when heraldry became estab-
lished in England as a science.
The heraldic colour names are
mainly of French derivation, or
influenced by the Latin lan-
guage widely used in the
Middle Ages.
The first heralds of England in-
variably employed the French
language (Anglo-Norman) as it
was then spoken, and, except
for changes in spelling due to
changes that have since taken
place both in English and
French, the terms and colours
are still used in heraldry to-day.

IMPERIAL PURPLE B.C.C. 109. The word purple has
Tyrian Purple always been used to refer to a
colour sensation produced by a
mixture of blue and red. It has
from earliest times been used as
a symbol of both royalty and
mourning. There is confusion
sometimes between Purple and
Violet. The terms should not
be used in a haphazard manner,
as violet is the name applied to
one of the general divisions of
the spectrum, and the range is
limited, while the range of hues
of purple is wide.
This colour was originally ob-
tained from the juices of a
species of mollusc found in the
waters of the Mediterranean Sea
and in ocean waters of other
warm climates. Great mounds
of their shells are still found on
the sites of ancient dyehouses.
In the days of the Roman
Empire the use of cloth dyed
with it was confined to members
of the Imperial Family.

INDIAN YELLOW ...... B.C.C. 6, Rep.
INDIGO see B.C.C. 48, Indigo.
INDIGO •••• B.C.C. 48. A colour adopted from
English Inde the uniforms of sailors became
Indian Blue popular as a textile colour in
Indico the early nineteenth century.
Marine Blue The colour was originally dyed
Matelot (Fr.) with Indigo, while in later years
Navy Blue synthetic indigo and various
Sailor Blue coal tar blues have been used
Seaman Blue for the purpose. In 1869 the
first attempt at synthesis was
made, and successfully accom-
plished in 1880.
The origin of the colour was
gradually forgotten until, now-
adays any dark blue is called
Navy, whether it is greenish or
violet in hue. Originally the
colour was called Marine Blue
and also Sailor Blue (Fr.
matelot), while Seaman Blue
was added to the list.
Thus confusion in colour and
name have arisen through the
original source being either for-
gotten or ignored.
Navy Blue should only be Indigo,
as all the names are merely
synonyms of Indigo. If varia-
tions are required, specific
colour names should be given,
as Purple Navy, B.C.C. 219.
Indigo colouring matter was used
in India and Egypt before the
Christian era; it was introduced
into Europe in the sixteenth
century.

to its wide use in all sections
of industry. The colour shown
is the average of a large number
of samples submitted by Textile

JET BLACK B.C.C. 220. The term black
Dead Black usually implies the absence of

greenish to rusty black.

LINDEN GREEN see B.C.C. 75, Chartreuse Yellow.
There is, unfortunately, a mis-
understanding with regard to
Linden and Lime Green. This
comes through the terms being
misapplied to colours from two
different trees.
In one case it refers to the colour
of the citrus fruit of the lime
tree and in the other it
refers to the flowers of the
European Linden tree. Diction-
aries state that the term lime is
a corrupt form of linden, and
not related to the word lime.
Therefore, we use the colour
name which has been in use in
this country from the beginning
of the English language.

that this term, like several
others on the card, cannot
be used to specify a definite

that it was felt to be in the
interests of colour users to
feature the colour, which is
here shown as the general

Olive of the olive tree. The name
Olivaceous came into use in the middle of

Indian Red synonymous terms applying to

PARMA VIOLET B.C.C. 216. A widely-used colour
name, featuring a variety of
colours from deep to pale
violet. Parma is a province in
the North of Italy; in French,
Parme. The association of
Parma and the violet colour is
due to the fact that the name
was given to a horticultural
variety of the plant in the form
" Viola parmensis,” popularly
known as Parma Violet; in
French, la violette de Parme.
In the nineteenth century the
name became extremely popular
as a colour name. The colour

Pillar Box Red appearing in the 8.5.1. standards
under this name. In general
use by the Post Office authori-
ties.
POWDER BLUE B.C.C. 193. The origin of this
Poudre Bleu (Fr.) name is not generally known.
The term was in use in the
seventeenth century, and came
from the French poudre bleu,
an old name for Smalt, which
is merely powdered blue glass,
the colour of which is due to
cobalt.
The term, however, has become a
generally used name in various
colour using industries, and has
deviated from its original mean-
ing so much that a separate
colour is featured here for
Powder Blue. This is matched
to samples submitted by Textile
and other Colour Using Indus-
tries, and will be seen to be a
pale version of Smalt. See
notes on Smalt.
PRIMROSE B.C.C. 111. Matched to flowers
of that name growing in Surrey

samples submitted by Textile
and other Colour Using Indus-

This refers to the dyestuff as dis-
tinct from the pigment, and
represents an average of sam-
ples submitted by Textile and
other Colour Using Industries.
PRUSSIAN BLUE Prussian blue and all its synonyms
(Pigment) are names which simply refer to
a chemical substance discovered
in 1704. At full strength it is
almost black; when slightly
reduced, it is a blue of violet
tone, and, according to the pig-
ment used, may have a bronze
reflex; when further reduced,
it becomes a blue of greenish
tone. Consequently, it is im-
possible to give an exact colour
standard without specifying the
degree of the reduction of the
substance.
PURPLE T.C.C.A. standard colour. Similar
to B.C.C. 180, Pansy.
PURPLE BROWN B.C.C. 136. A colour name

Heraldry. See Heraldic Colours.


Q-
QUAKER GREY see B.C.C. 71, Gault Grey. All
Quaker colours are inventions,
as no definite colour has ever
been specified for this sect.
The only requirement in the
Quaker costume was that it
should be simple, unobtrusive,
and of any dull colour. The
restriction respecting these col-
ours, however, applied only to
men and not to women. A list
of modern colour names, how-
ever, includes such terms as
Quaker Blue, Quaker Drab, but,
as these are fictitious, they are
at the present time subject to
considerable variation. The
colour given here is lighter in
tone than 8.5.1. Quaker Grey.

RESEDA B.C.C. 77. A colour name used
Mignonette in England during the last
decade of the nineteenth cen-
tury. Although it is a popular

realise that it is merely the
French word for Mignonette.

ROSE PINK B.C.C. 32. Although this name
Hermosa Pink should not perhaps be used to
designate a specific colour
sensation, it has, however,
been included here owing
to its universal use. The
colour featured is the general
representation of samples sub-
mitted by Textile and other
Colour Using Industries.
Similar to T.C.C.A. Orchid Pink.
ROSE TAUPE B.C.C. 190. See notes on Mole.

R.A.F. BLUE GREY B.C.C. 156. Carefully matched to
the official colour supplied by
the Royal Air Force, and similar
to the 8.5.1. standard colour of
the same name.
ROYAL BLUE B.C.C. 197. This colour name has
been used from the sixteenth
century in connection with
Smalt (Cobalt) and Prussian
Blue.


The more modern colour under
this name, which was first used
in the latter part of the nine-
teenth century, was probably
derived from one of these
earlier colours. Owing to its
wide use in all colour using
trades, it is necessary to feature
this colour as shown by general
representation of a number of
samples submitted by Textile
and other Colour Using Indus-
tries.
Similar to 8.5.1. Azure.
For 8.5.1. Royal Blue, see B.C.C.

SAXE BLUE B.C.C. 45. This is really an
improper name for a specific
colour sensation, since Saxon
Blue, from which Saxe is de-
rived, is the name of a chemical
substance only, a dye from
which are produced all tones of


blue from light to dark. Many
samples of Saxe were submitted,
and generally showed a varia-
tion of tone from Alice Blue,
B.C.C. 43, to Mineral Blue,
B.C.C. 46. The colour here
given under the name " Saxe ”
Blue is a general representation
of the colours submitted by
Textile and other Colour Using
Industries.
The word " Saxe ” is not English,
but is adopted from the French,
where it means Saxony or
Saxon. Saxony Blue was a
universally-used synonym for
Smalt as early as 1550. Like-
wise Bleu de Saxe has long
been a synonym for Prussian
Blue, but since 1753 Saxon Blue
has been most familiar as a
widely-used name for indigo
extract.

SHALE GREEN see B.C.C. 23, Malachite Green.


SHELL PINK B.C.C. 206. It may be said that
this term, like several others
appearing on the card, should
not be used to specify a definite
colour sensation owing to the
tremendous varieties of pink
seen in different shells. The
name, however, is used so
generally that its inclusion was
found to be necessary, and the
colour here featured is the
general representation of a
number of samples submitted
by Textile and other Colour
Using Industries.
Similar to T.C.C.A. Tea Rose.

ULTRAMARINE * B.C.C. 148. The genuine ultra-
Prench Blue marine was extracted from
French Ultra Lapis Lazuli, and was extremely
Oriental Blue valuable. In fact, it is said that
Permanent Blue in the days of the Italian
Renaissance, patrons were ex-
pected to provide the artists
with this colour. After the
first extraction of colour from
the Lapis, further extractions
took place, each successive pro-
cess providing a weaker colour,
until the colour obtained had
very little blue, and was practi-
cally grey, and thus became
known as Ultramarine Ash.
The colour here shown is a
general representation of sam-
ples received from artists’
colourmen of artificial ultra-
marine, which has been known
under various names.

Lavender Grey sentation of samples submitted
by Textile and other Colour
using Industries.
VIRIDENE GREEN see B.C.C. 100, Spectrum Green,
and Emerald Green. The
Repertoire gives this as the
English name for Viridian
Green, whereas in the first case
it was used as a synonym for
Emerald (Gem).
Viridian is transparent oxide of
chromium. The term Viridene
had a brief vogue in England as
a synonym for the true Viridian,
which was perhaps responsible
for the error. In 1878 a green
coal tar dye under the name of
Viridene was introduced, but
was not much used.
VIRIDIAN see B.C.C. 100, Spectrum Green,

WEDGWOOD BLUE ...... B.C.C. 215. Many colours are
featured under this name, but
the colour here given was care-
fully matched to a piece of
" Light Wedgwood Ware.”
Wedgwood provides one of
those rare examples where it is
correct to use the terms light
and dark with reference to
colours, since in this case they
refer to specific colour sensa-
tions.


WHITE B.C.C. 1. Although White is
referred to as having no colour,
it is found in actual practice
that there are as great a number
of variations of so-called White
as of any other colour. B.C.C.
1 is the general representation
of samples submitted under that
name by Textile and other
Colour Using Industries.
WINE see no tes on Claret.
Y.
YELLOW OCHRE see B.C.C. 66, Buff. A general
Chinese Yellow representation of a deep tone of
English Ochre yellow ochre shown by artists’
French Ochre colourmen.
Gold Earth The word ochre is from the
Imperial Yellow ancient Greek ochros, used
Mineral Yellow specially with reference to
Mountain Yellow yellowish colours. This term
Oxford Chrome was later applied to yellowish
Oxford Yellow earth, and is one of the oldest
Oxide Yellow pigments known. The clays
from which it is made naturally
vary in colour and quality. The
word ochre should never be
used without a qualifying
adjective.
