THE GLACIAL PERIOD IN THE SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE.
npHE tablets on which the ice of the Glacial period left
* its record in the southern hemisphere are probably
now mostly covered by the sea, and we cannot trace
its progress and extent with the same facility and certainty
as in the northern temperate regions. Yet notwithstanding
this, and also that the land surfaces of the South that have
been glaciated have not been studied to anything like the
same extent as in Europe and North America, points of
resemblance are apparent, and grounds exist for the belief
that both hemispheres have passed through a somewhat
similar glacial experience.
In our hemisphere, I have sought to show in former
papers, there were two ways in which the ice spread. One
was an accumulation on mountain-chains, and a radiation
from them over the surrounding country. The other, and I
think by far the most important, was the gradual advance
of a ridge of ice down the bed of the North Atlantic, and
probably also of the North Pacific, which blocked up the
drainage of the continents as far as it extended, and caused
enormous lakes of fresh or brackish water and immense
destruction of life amongst the animals that were caught on
the plains by the rising floods. The marks left by the
Atlantic ice are seen in Europe, as far as the southern ex-
tremity of Ireland, and in America, to the south of New
York, and beyond these points, its further progress can be
traced by the evidence of the interruption of the drainage
of the continents as far as the northern slopes of the
Pyrenees on one side of the Atlantic, and to the coasts of


Virginia on the other. The real markings on the rocks,
however, have not been traced in Europe farther south than
51� N. lat., and in America than 40� N. lat., excepting those
of the ice that proceeded from the mountain ranges.
In the other hemisphere, within the distance from the
Southern Pole that the ice has been shown by adtual
markings on the rocks to have reached from the North Pole
on the European coasts, ?that is, to latitude 51 0 N., ?there
are no large masses of land, excepting the extreme end of
South America and the Antarctic continent. And if we take
a corresponding circle in the south to the limit the ice has
left its marks in America or to lat. 40�, we shall still only
embrace Patagonia in South America and the Middle Island
in New Zealand. Even if we take the furthest limit of the
extension of the Atlantic ice, as shown by its interference
with the drainage of the American continent, we only bring
South America as far north as the Rio Plata, and New
Zealand and Tasmania, with the southern end of Australia,
within the area where we could expedt to find any similar
evidence on the supposition that in the Glacial period the
ice extended everywhere as far from the Southern Pole as
its extreme limit reached from the Northern.
The conditions are therefore very different in the two
hemispheres. In the one, broad continents stretch from
within the Ardtic circle toward and up to the Equator ; in
the other, nearly the whole of the temperate zone is covered
with water. If, then, there were much less evidence than
there is of the glaciation of southern lands, we need not
have been surprised; but of late there seems to have arisen
an idea amongst some geologists that there is no evidence
in the southern hemisphere of the occurrence of a Glacial
period, and it may be useful if I bring together what has
been described, and show how far the phenomena agree
with those of the northern hemisphere.
Commencing in America, immediately south of the
Equator, we have first to deal with the remarkable theory
of Agassiz, that the great valley of the Amazon was once
filled with ice flowing from the distant Andes, which left an
enormous terminal moraine on the Atlantic coast. This
moraine he supposed blocked up for a time tbe waters of the
great valley, and caused the deposition of various stratified
deposits covered by a peculiar drift clay that rarely contains
transported boulders. I have examined this deposit from
Pernambuco northwards through the provinces of Ceara and
Maranham, as. far as Para. In some parts it is composed of
small angular fragments of rock, cemented together by an


ochraceous clay, and resembling the breccia at the base of
the Permian rocks in Westmoreland. In others it is a fer-
ruginous clay, containing few stones, but with a layer of
quartz pebbles at its base. It is not confined to the valleys,
but wraps over the hills like a mantle. Now and then it
contains large boulders of granite, but I could never satisfy
myself that these might not have been left during the
decomposition and denudation of the rocks of the neigh-
bourhood. It differs much from any glacial deposit I have
seen, and I am sorry that I can neither suggest any theory
to account for its origin nor agree with that of the illustrious
Agassiz. To the latter there seems to me insuperable ob-
ieftions. There are no moraines in the valley of the Lower
Amazon. The terminal one might have been, as Agassiz
suggests, washed away by the waves of the Atlantic, but the
great glacier ought to have left others to mark the various
stages of its recession. No remnant of these has been
found, and we cannot believe that a glacier that left a huge
moraine stretching for hundreds of miles across the whole
seaward front of the Amazon Valley have shrunk
back for more than 1000 miles without leaving any what-
ever to mark its retreating course. The Valley of the
Amazon abounds with birds and beasts, many of which aie
found nowhere else. Peculiar species of fishes swarm in
the river and its tributaries. If the great valley was filled
with ice, where did these find a refuge ? To Agassiz this
did not present any difficulty, as he believed that the present
inhabitants of the world had been created since the Glacial
period ; but to those who hold the opinion that they are
descended from pre-glacial ancestors, and that since the
Glacial period there has not been much variation, the pecu-
liar genera and species of the fauna of the Amazon Valley
present serious objections to the theory.
Had Agassiz found in the Valley of the Amazon what he
considered moraines, I should have had much difficulty in
believing that he was mistaken, for no man had more expe-
rience of ice-aCtion, present and past. Before him, Char-
pentier and others had worked out the conclusion that the
glaciers of the Alps had in former days stretched far beyond
their present limits, but they referred that extension to an
elevation of the mountains, and not to a change of climate
that affeCted all the northern parts of the continent. Agas-
siz accepted the theory, at first, that the upheaval of the
Alps must, in some way or other, have been conneaed with
the phenomena, but further study led him to abandon it,
and conclude that the climatic conditions could not have


been local, but must have been cosmic. ? When,? he says,
? Switzerland was bridged across from range to range, by a
mass of ice stretching southward into Lombardy and Tus-
cany, northward into France and Burgundy, the rest of
Europe could not have remained unaffected by the causes
which induced this state of things.?* Agassiz was thus
the founder of the theory of a ? Glacial Period,? and in
Great Britain, in Scandinavia, and in North America, evi-
dence was soon found, and has been ever since accumulating,
attesting the truth of his grand generalisation.
He was not likely to be mistaken as to what constituted
a moraine, but he found none in the great valley, and he
says himself that he had not here the positive evidence that
had guided him in his previous glacial investigations.t Not
so, however, with regard to his discovery of the marks of
glaciation on the mountains of Ceara. Here, only about
three degrees south of the Equator, he found undoubted
moraines blocking up the valleys, and the evidence of gla-
cial adtion was to him as clear as in the valleys of Switzer-
land, of Scotland, and of the Northern States of
This is the nearest point to the Equator at which
glacial moraines have been found. On the other side of the
line I found huge moraines in the northern part of Nicara-
gua, near the boundary between it and Honduras, in lat.
13 0 47' N. || This is the farthest south that glacial aCtion
has been traced in the northern hemisphere. Prof. W. M.
Gabb has informed me that in his geological researches in the
mountains of Costa Rica he found no evidence of glaciation.
Between the moraines of northern Nicaragua and those of
the mountains of Ceara there is an area comprising about
17 0 of latitude, and including most of Nicaragua, the whole
of Costa Rica, of Columbia, of Equador, and of the great
valley of the Amazons, in which no certain signs of glacia-
tion have been seen. This wide region includes several
large zoological sub-provinces, characterised by highly pecu-
liar tropical genera, and a wealth of species not met with
elsewhere on the continents to the north and south. Within
this area are large groups of inseCts the extreme forms of
which are linked together by a series of gradations, and
every district has its representative forms of types that run
through the whole. But as we travel south from the un-
glaciated districts lying between lat. 14 0 N. and lat. 3 0 S. the

species become more and more separated ; the genera com-
prise species as far removed from each other as before, but
these are not connedted by the same intermediate forms.
These gaps become wider and wider as we get farther south,
until at the extreme end of the continent, where the rocks
are glaciated from ocean to ocean, isolation, and not affinity,
is the characteristic of the fauna, which is made up of waifs
and strays that appear rather to have struggled in from the
outside, upon a country that had been depopulated, than to
have been developed within it.
In the glaciers of Ceara and northern Nicaragua we find
the first parallel between the glaciation of the two hemi-
spheres ; and it is to be noted here, as it may be elsewhere,
that there appears to have been more ice heaped up on the
southern half of the world than on the northern, the much
nearer approach of the glaciers to the Equator in Brazil
than in Central America being the first evidence of it. This
was probably due, not to greater cold, but to greater precipi-
tation, proportional to the vast evaporating area of the
Southern Ocean.
Travelling southward, we find that Mr. David Forbes no-
ticed in Bolivia great accumulations of detritus with grooved
stones and deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those that he
was familiar with in Norway.* And on the opposite side of
the continent, near Rio Janeiro, Prof. Hartt has described
moraines left by glaciers that formerly came down from the
mountains of Tijuca.t
Still farther south the evidences of glacial adtion increase.
For the description of the phenomena of La Plata, Patago-
nia, and Chile we must still turn to the observations of
Darwin made more than forty years ago, which, when we
consider that the glacial theory was in its infancy, evince
the same rare powers of acute observation and philosophical
generalisation that have since made his name so famous.
Ascending the River Santa Cruz, Darwin found, at a dis-
tance of about ioo miles from the Atlantic and at a height
of about 1400 feet above the level of the sea, a great abun-
dance of large angular boulders that had been transported
from the Cordillera, the nearest slope of which was still
about 60 miles distant. On both sides of the continent from
lat. 4i�S. to the southern extremity of it, he considers there
is the clearest evidence of former glacial adtion in numerous
immense boulders transported far from their parent source. J

He describes Terra del Fuego as largely covered with till
and boulder clay perfectly unstratilied, and in which he
looked in vain for marine remains.
On the western coast the ice from the Chilian Cordillera
appears to have flowed across the Straits to the island of
Chiloe, as Darwin found it covered with large boulders of
granite and syenite that had come from the mainland. On
one of the Chonos Islands he found a quantity of commi-
nuted marine shells in the drift, and in Chiloe two or three
fragments of a Cytherea * We may compare these farts
with those in the northern hemisphere, where the drift in
the southern shores of the Baltic, brought by land ice from
Scandinavia, is found?as in the vicinity of Bromberg?to
contain broken and worn sea-shells that have probably been
picked up in the passage of the ice across the ocean-bed.
Bearing just the same relation to the Glacial period in
South America as the loess of the Rhine and the Danube
does in Europe, and still more resembling the diluvial clay
of the South of Russia, the Pampean mud is spread out m
Rio Plata, Banna Oriental, and Entre Rios. It covers an
immense trart of country, Darwin passed continuously
over it from the Rio Colorado to St. Fe Bajada, a distance
of 500 geographical miles, whilst M. d?Orbigny traced it for
250 miles farther north. From east to west, in the latitude
of the Plata, it extends for at least 300 miles.
It is a reddish, slightly indurated, argillaceous earth,
sometimes more than 100 feet thick, with lines of calcareous
concretions, and occasionally changing into a compart
marly rock. Marine shells are found scattered ovei the
surface of this deposit at some places ; but Darwin notices,
as a remarkable fart, their absence throughout the deposit,
excepting in the uppermost layers near Buenos Ayres.
Even microscopical organisms appear to be veiy rare, and
only found in the lower part of the deposit. T. hus, in some
of the red mud scraped from the tooth of a Mastodon found
at the bottom of the Pampean mud at Gorodona, Prof.
Ehrenberg found seven species of Polygastrica and thirteen
species of Phytoliiharia. Of these nearly all are of fresh-
water origin, only three being marine. At Monte Hermoso,
in Bahia Blanca, the lower part of the Pampean mud con-
tains a similar assemblage of microscopical organisms.
Prof. Ehrenberg considers that they must have lived m
brackish water. .

formation are its vast extent and the great number of the
remains of large extindt mammals imbedded in it. Mr.
Darwin says that he is firmly convinced that it would be
impossible to cut a deep trench in any line across the
Pampas without meeting with the remains of some quadru-
ped. Wherever sections are exposed skeletons 01 detached
bones are found, so that ? the whole area of the Pampas is
one wide sepulchre of these extina gigantic quadrupeds.
At Punta Alta, within an area of about 200 yards square,
were found the remains of no less than nine species of
gigantic extina mammals, including three Megatheriums, a
Megalonyx, a Mylodon, and an extina horse. Some of the
skeletons were nearly perfect, besides which there were
many detached bones. On the banks of the Parana two
entire skeletons of the Mastodon were found near the base
of the Pampean mud. . ,
The Pampas extend southwards to the Rio Colorado.
There, beds of gravel begin to take the place of the Pam-
pean mud. These are at first thin, and composed of small
pebbles. Farther south the gravel-beds are composed ot
coarser pebbles, with sometimes large boulders. This de-
posit of shingle extends for 800 miles up to the Straits ot
Magellan. In some parts the plains of gravel rise in step-
formed terraces to a height of 1200 feet above the sea.
Marine shells are scattered over the surface of the plains,
but are not found in the beds of gravel, which, like the
Pampean mud, contain in some parts numerous remains
of the great extina quadrupeds. > .
Darwin mentions that the Mammalian remains have not
anywhere been found in existing marshes or peat-beds: all
are entombed in the body of the deposit of which the plains
are composed. ? _ , . , ~ *
In the Pampas, in the caves of Brazil, and in deposits ol
similar age in other parts of South America, more than one
hundred extina species of quadrupeds, many of great size,
have been found. There are representatives of the sloths
and armadillos as large as existing elephants. 1 here are
also representatives of genera that do not now exist in
South America, but still live in other parts of the world ?
such as leopards and antelopes. The remains of the horse
are abundant, though when the Spaniards discovered America
it was extina there. f

animals, has given an excellent summary of the fadts known
respecting these lost animals, and has placed the question
of their extinction before us with clear-cut distinctness.*
He shows that in very recent geological times a great
change has taken place in the fauna not only of South
America, but of North America and Europe, and that this
change is unprecedented in older geological periods. We
now live, he says, ? in a zoologically impoverished world,
from which all the hugest and fiercest and strangest forms
have disappeared.? He urges, with luminous force, that
there must have been some physical cause for this great
change, which must have aCted at the same time over large
portions of the earth?s surface. Such a cause he considers
is to be found in that great era, the glacial period.
There is much to be said in favour of Mr. Wallace?s con-
clusion. The Pampean mud occupies the same relation to
recent deposits as other clays whose glacial age has been
satisfactorily determined. Both it and the gravel-beds of
Patagonia, in many places, lie direCtly above marine depo-
sits of undoubted late Pliocene age, as they contain shells
of Ostrea Patagonica. They hold, therefore, the same posi-
tion between the tertiary and recent deposits that glacial
beds occupy in other countries. The Patagonian deposits
also contain large boulders that have been transported from
the Cordillera.
The Pampean mud has been compared with the loess of
the Rhine?a similar fine slightly-indurated clay, which
contains the bones of the extinCf mammoth and woolly
rhinoceros. It appears to be still more like the beds of
diluvial clay that form the wide-spread steppes of Southern
Russia. This clay is of undoubted Glacial age, and when
traced northward contains large blocks of stone derived
from rocks hundreds of miles to the north, just as the Pam-
pean mud when traced southward is replaced by gravel-beds
with boulders from the Cordillera. In the January number
of this Journal I have advocated the theory that the diluvial
clays of Northern Europe and the loess of the Rhine and
the Danube were spread out in a great lake, when the bed
of the Atlantic was occupied by ice that stopped the drainage
of Europe as far as it extended. In eastern North America
there is evidence of a similar interruption to the drainage
of the continent to at least as far as North Virginia.
It is a remarkable faft that to about as far from the South
Pole in South America as from the North Pole in North
* Geographical Distribution #f Animals, vol. i., p. 143.


America there is the same evidence of the land having
been covered with water which was not that of the sea; as
the deposits left by it do not contain marine remains. If
we may suppose that a similar mass of ice accumulated
around, and spread from the Antarctic as from the ArCtic
regions, and that ultimately a prolongation or arm of that
icy mass reached the eastern coast of South America, so
as to dam back the streams as far as the Rio Plata, we
shall have, I believe, a complete explanation of the deposi-
tion of the Pampean mud and the Patagonian gravels, and
of the destruction of the great mammals and the entomb-
ment of their remains.
The present physical geography of the world and the
existing distribution of its inhabitants were immediately
preceded by a wide-spread entombment of land animals, un-
paralleled elsewhere in the geological record. In lake basins
and estuaries of Eocene and Miocene age there have been
preserved abundant remains of land animals, more especially
in connection with the movements of elevation of certain
mountain chains and the volcanic phenomena that accom-
panied them ; but, compared with that which we are dis-
cussing, these entombments are insignificant and partial.
The destruction of life that took place in the Glacial period
was continental, if not world-wide, in its extent. The de-
posits in which the remains are found were not formed in
old lake basins; they fringe, and in some cases nearly over-
spread, the continents, or run in great arms up the larger
valleys. Here and there in America, Europe, and Asia,
there are isolated deposits containing the remains of tertiary
mammals, but the bones of the glacial mammals are spread
over all the northern parts of the northern continents, and
in South America are of equal extent.
The blockage of the coasts by ice flowing down the ocean
beds seems just such an event as would bring about the
destruction of life and the entombment of the remains of
which we have so much evidence. I shall have to return to
the consideration of the possibility of such a mass of ice
having advanced northwards from the Antarctic circle when
we have examined the evidences of glaciation in New
Zealand ; but let us assume now for a moment that such an
accumulation did take place, and that it flowed down the
eastern coast of South America ; then, as it blocked up the
drainage of each great valley, progressively from the south,
northward, the waters pounded back would rise and over-
whelm the animals living on the plains. The nature of the
deposits favours this supposition. The lowest parts, or


those first formed, contain some evidence of brackish water
conditions such as might have been produced by the em-
bracement of the salt water of bays within the area blocked
up by the ice ; but the upper parts contain nothing but the
remains of land animals, whilst the proof of the presence
of water is complete in the rounded and stratified shingle
forming the Patagonian plains.
Mr. Wallace has shown that the cave fauna in Brazil
differs from that of the Pampas in containing a larger pro-
portion of existing genera, and is inclined to believe that
this may imply that the Pampean mud is a little older than
the cave deposits.* It may, however, be due, I think, to
the destruction of life having been more complete in Buenos
Ayres and Patagonia than in Brazil, and that, in pre-glacial
times, as now, the former countries formed a part of a dis-
tinct zoological sub-region. That the destruction of life in
Brazil should have been less complete than farther south is
likely ?not only because we have no proof that the great
flood extended so far north, but because there was a large
extent of country, neither covered with ice nor overwhelmed
with water, where many of the species might be preserved.
In Patagonia and Buenos Ayres the lower country was
covered with water, the upper mostly with glaciers descending
from the mountains, so that the retreat of the animals from
the flood was in a great measure cut off. The peculiar spe-
cies that have been preserved in the Chilian sub-region,
which includes Patagonia and Buenos Ayres, are principally
alpine forms, such as the Chinchillas, the Alpacas, and the
Viscachas, which we may suppose found a refuge during the
great flood in some high lands not covered with glacier ice.
Others may have retreated northward up the western side
of the Andes, and returned southward after the greatest
severity of the Glacial period had passed away. The re-
mains of an extindt llama are found on the high plains of
Mexico, so that the genus had undoubtedly a former greater
extension northwards. The principal extirpation of life
appears to have been amongst the bulky species, on whom
the changes of environment would press most heavily, and
which were confined to low-lying districts. Thus the Mas-
todon, whose remains are found at great heights in the
Andes, appears to have escaped the complete destruction
that befel its bulky companions at the time of the greatest
extension of the ice, as I saw remains of it in Mexico that
from their fresh appearance were probably as recent as those

of the species that is found in post-glacial deposits in the
Northern States.
Whilst the eastern coasts of Patagonia are fringed with
plains of gravel, the western are indented with deep fiords
like those of Norway, and, as Dana and Ramsay have
shown, these fiords are evidence of great glaciation, and
have probably been excavated by ice-adtion.
Leaving South America and passing to the continent of
Africa, we find but little evidence of the Glacial period, as
its southern extremity only reaches to about lat. 35 S. Mr.
G. W. Stow has, however, shown that the southern ranges
of mountains undoubtedly bore glaciers. 1 hus the Katberg
range is in many parts rounded and smoothed, as if by the
passage of ice, and on its northern slopes there are great
mounds and ridges of unstratified clay packed with angular
boulders of every size, from small gravel and pieces of a few
pounds weight to masses of several tons.* The slopes of
the Stormberg are similarly glaciated, and there are immense
accumulations of morainic matter in all the valleys. Both
lateral and terminal moraines have been observed in these
mountains. In British Kaffraria, near Greytown, the ice
would appear to have reached nearly to the present sea-level.
Mr. Stow comes to the conclusion that the of
the hills in the interior, the numerous dome-shaped rocks,
the enormous erratic boulders in positions where water could
not have carried them, the frequency of unstratified clays,
clays with imbedded angular boulders, drift and lofty mounds
of boulders, and the large tradts of country thickly spread
over with unstratified clays and superimposed fragments of
rock, ?all indicate the conditions that in other countries
characterise the Glacial period.t
The Rev. W. B. Clarke has informed Mr. Darwin of fadts
from which it appears that there are traces of former glacial
adtion on the mountains of the south-eastern corner of
Australia, but Ido not know the particulars.s I have not
seen any notice of glacial phenomena in Tasmania, but it is
extremely probable that they will be found. In New Zealand
the evidences of former glaciation are clear and unmis-
takable, and they have been described by many able ob-
servers. The large glaciers that still exist in the mountains
of the South Island bear about the same relation to the

ancient ones as those of the European Alps do to the much
larger ones of the Glacial period. The western sea-board
is penetrated by long sounds or fiords, many of which are
more than 1000 feet deep. On the eastern side of the range
the fiords are replaced by arms of large and deep fresh-water
lakes; and so far do the marine fiords on one side, and the
arms of the fresh-water lakes on the other, cut into the
mountain chain that in many places they reach to within
10 miles of each other.* The New Zealand geologists
appear to be unanimous in ascribing the formation of the
sounds and deep lakes to the acftion of ice. The former
great extension of the glaciers is marked by immense mo-
rainic accumulations and transported boulders. These
deposits have been ably described by Dr. Haast. For more
than go miles south of the River Mikonuhi, on the western
coast, all the lower country is covered by mounds and
sheets composed of unstratified clays packed with boulders
from the mountain chain. The moraines form low hills
bounding the sea, the waves of which have cut them into
cliffs. Along the whole of this shore glaciers must have
descended from the New Zealand Alps down to, and pro-
bably beyond the present sea-level. Some of the imbedded
blocks exposed in the sections on the sea-coast are of im-
mense size, often larger than the celebrated Pierre-a-bot, in
the Jura, These blocks have principally been brought from
the very centre of the chain, and the distribution of the
different rock formations in the drift and alluvial beds has
led Dr. Haast to the conclusion that the configuration of
the mountain chain was similar to what it is now at the
time of the great extension of the glaciers.t
On the eastern side of the range the old glaciers did not
reach to so low a level as on the western side, but terminated
many miles from the sea-coast, which is bounded by great
plains of stratified drift. In the northern part of the South
Island Mr. Locke Travers has shown that many of the lakes
are enclosed by huge moraines,J and in the North Island
there is also evidence of intense glacial acftion.
The southern and eastern coasts of the South Island are
bordered by great plains, composed of gravel and rounded
boulders, which sometimes overlie beds of silt containing
bones of the extincft moas. In the south part of the island
the Southland Plains extend for nearly 40 miles along the

coast, and back from it for about 26 miles, besides sending
arms up the valleys of the Mataura, Oreti, and Jacob

with some seams of lignite near the base of the deposits.
It wraps around the Moonlight Range and Hokonui Hills,
which stand up like islands out of it. The beds of which
it is composed contain the bones of the great extindt
apterous birds. Marine remains are not found, but Captain
Hutton ascribes its formation to the adtion of the sea when
the land stood at a lower level, as he finds it impossible to
believe ? that the alluvia of the Mataura, the Oreti, and
the Jacob Rivers should all join one another with gradual
slopes behind the seaward range of hills without the inter-
vention of some uniform widely-adting cause, such as the
sea.?*

These plains rise gradually from the sea-coast until they
attain a height of about 600 feet next the mountains. On
the coast they overlie marine deposits of late Pliocene age.
The above sedtion, from the work already quoted, shows the
relation of the beds on the north side of Oamaru Cape.
The silt formation extends inland for a considerable dis-
tance, and is extensively developed at Hampden. Captain
Hutton notes the great analogy it presents to the Pampean
formation of South America. The remains of the extindt
birds are distributed, like those of the extindt beasts at
Buenos Ayres, throughout the deposit. The above sedtion

On the east coast, great plains, separated by rocky pro-
montories, border the sea. The well-known Canterbury

their origin has been a fruitful source of controversy ; they
are 112 miles in length, and run back from the coast to the
base of the mountains in the interior; gradually rising until
they attain an elevation of about 1500 feet above the sea,
according to Dr. Hochstetter.* These plains are composed
of boulders, gravels, sand, and clay, and in some parts the
deposits are upwards of 200 feet thick. Throughout the
whole formation no marine remains have been found. At
Banks?s Peninsula the gravel-beds are replaced by deposits
of silt that cover the volcanic hills to a height of about
800 feet above the sea. This fine loam must, from its
description, closely resemble the loess of the Rhine and
Danube, and it contains the bones of the great wingless
birds and land-shells, but nowhere has the least trace of
marine life been found in it.t
We have thus in New Zealand a repetition of the pheno-
mena observed in Patagonia ?great plains of gravel and silt
on the eastern, and deep sounds or fiords on the western,
coasts. In both countries the deposits of the plains entomb
the remains of large extindt animals, and their geological
age is fixed by both overlying marine beds of late Pliocene
age. They are the representatives in position of the
glacial beds of the northern hemisphere. Considering the
very different distribution of land and water in the two
hemispheres the resemblance of their glacial phenomena is
most remarkable. Yet still more remarkable is it that most
of the able naturalists of New Zealand not only deny that
there is proof of a Glacial epoch in their country, but even
are inclined to refuse us one elsewhere on the evidence they
find there. I do not gather very clearly Dr. Haast?s opinion
on this question, and as a few years ago he was certainly in
favour of New Zealand having been covered with an ice-
sheet like Greenland, he may perhaps be excepted ; but the
remainder of the geologists, headed by Dr. Hedtor and
Capt. Hutton, contend that the glaciation of New Zealand
had no connedtion with a general glacial period, and that
the great accumulation of ice was owing to the mountains

having then been higher. Dr. Hedtor, who first suggested
this explanation, candidly admits that the shore deposits do
not support it, and considers that there must have been
unequal movements of elevation, and that the former
greater Aeight of the mountains was due to their greater
bulk, which has since been reduced by denudation.
Dr. Hedtor, so far as I can make out from his writings,
only seems to offer this as an alternative to accepting the
occurrence of a general Glacial epoch, and we must turn to
the works of Captain Hutton for the reasons that have weighed
with the New Zealand geologists in rejedting the theory of
a Glacial period, which, since Agassiz first propounded it for
the northern hemisphere, has been adopted by nearly all our
leading geologists. In the first place Captain Hutton thinks
that the date of the last great glacier period of New Zealand,
must be placed much further back than that of the northern
hemisphere, because, since it occurred, some of the old lake
basins have been filled up with deposits brought down by
the streams ; the surfaces of the rocks that were formerly
covered with ice have been weathered to a depth of ten or
twelve feet ; old river courses have been filled with gravels,
and the streams have cut new channels to great depths, so
that in many places the drainage system of the country has
been altered.* But in reality these fadts should rather have
been advanced as evidence of the analogy of the glacial
phenomena of the two hemispheres instead of as a distinction
between them. We have but to appeal to the erosion of the
deep gorge of the Niagara, for at least a distance of three
miles since the glaciation of Canada, to the reversal of the
drainage of the great lakes from the Mississippi into the St.
Lawrence, to the buried old river channels of the north of
England and of Scotland, and to the numerous filled-up lake
basins of Europe and America, to show that it is the resem-
blances and not the differences that strike us with greatest force.
Captain Hutton has not, however, restricted his argument
to the physical side of the question, but has sought to
strengthen it by appealing to the evidence of the organic
remains. It is admitted that the Glacial deposits contain
no marine organism, but, as we have already seen, they over-
lie beds of gravel and sand, with sea shells of late Pliocene
age, as shown in the Oamaru sedtion. These late Pliocene
deposits are largely developed at Wanganui in Cook?s Strait,
and it is from a study of the present and past range of the
species of the marine mollusks in these and similar beds,
* Geology and Gold Fields of Otago, p. 94.


that Captain Hutton?s ingenious argument is founded. He
has given a list of a great number of mollusks found in these
beds that do not now live so far south, whilst only a few
occur that do not now live so far north.* This, he thinks,
proves that there was no reduction in the general tem-
perature in times immediately preceding the glaciation of the
country. We do not know, however, the age of these pre-
glacial deposits, and they may be as far back in time as
our coralline crag, and the value of the evidence has been
much lessened by some facts described by Mr. C. W. Purnell.
He states that at Wanganui there are three distinct fossil-
iferous strata, separated by thick beds of volcanic mud, and
that the shells of these different horizons are mixed together
in Captain Hutton?s lists.f If this is so, it may yet appear,
when the fauna of each zone is more critically studied, that
the same evidence of a gradual refrigeration of the climate
in the Pliocene epoch exists in New Zealand as in Europe.
Captain Hutton further argues that as many of the shells
that extend back to the Miocene epoch, and still exist on
the coast of New Zealand, are littoral species, and are not
found elsewhere, we should have to suppose, if the extension
of the glaciers was due to the change in the climate, that
during the cold period they crossed the deep sea to Australia
or Polynesia, and that, on the return of a warmer cli-
mate, they all came back again to New Zealand without
leaving any behind on the coasts they had retired to during
the Glacial period. He concludes, therefore, that since the
Miocene period there can have been no reduction of tem-
perature sufficient to account for the former extension of the
glaciers, and that we must necessarily look to elevation of
the land as the main cause. He admits, however, that it is
possible that the two may have been combined, but con-
siders that at present the evidence seems to be in favour of
there never having been a Glacial epoch in New Zealand,
and consequently none in the southern hemisphere.;
Now, if the theories I have advocated respe(sting the
Glacial period are correct, the two conditions of the glacia-
tion of the land, and at the same time its relatively greater
elevation above the level of the ocean, must have existed
together. For such an amount of ice as is necessary could
not be piled up around and outside the Arctic and Antarctic
circles at the same time without abstracting so much water

lished an abstiaft of his views in the Geological Magazine, 1875, p. 580.

from the ocean as to lower its level to the extent, I believe,
of about 2000 feet; and this lowering of the ocean would
give a coast line along which the littoral mollusks might
retreat northwards during the Glacial period. In the line
of soundings made between Australia and New Zealand by
the officers of the Challenger , it was found that from the
Australian shore the water deepened gradually until a depth
was attained of 2600 fathoms, at about one-third the dis-
tance sccross. Nearer New Zealand the water shoaled
suddenly, and at a distance of about 280 miles from its
shore, a depth of only 275 fathoms, or 1650 feet, was found
with a rocky bottom. These soundings were taken in one
line only, and there can be scarcely a doubt that a lowering
of the sea level 2000 feet would add more than 300 miles to
the extension of New Zealand northward, and afford the
necessary refuge for its fauna and flora during the Glacial
period.
To prove the necessity of lands to the northward, now sub-
merged, having then been above the sea, it was not necessary
to appeal to the evidence of the marine shells, which is so
far doubtful, as it is known that many shallow water species,
under other circumstances, live at a great depth ; as that of
the inhabitants of the land was equally available and more
certain. For the bones of the great extindt birds are not
confined to the drift beds, but are found in old kitchen
middens, ovens, encampments, and other places on the sur-
face of the glacial beds, proving, that after the cold period
had passed away, they returned again. It is certain that
they must have been expelled from the existing area of the
South Island, when glaciers came down beyond the present
coast lines on the west side, and the great plains of drift
were being formed under water on the east. The marine
mollusks might have passed across some channels of the
sea, but the apterous birds required a continuous land pas-
sage during their retreat, and the withdrawal of the waters
of the ocean would have afforded this, not only to the North
Island, but to the great plateau now submerged, whose
existence has been indicated by the few soundings of the
Challenger expedition.
We may agree with the New Zealand geologists that
their country stood at a higher, level above the ocean than it
now does when it was glaciated ; but instead of looking upon
this as evidence in favour of local causes having led to the
accumulation of the ice, it is only another link in the evi-
dence to prove that the level of the ocean was lowered, and
that the glaciation of the southern hemisphere took place at


the same time as that of the northern, as it occurred when
the land stood relatively to the sea higher than it now does.
There is the same objection to its being movements of the
land that effeaed this, as there is to the theory of similar
land movements in Great Britain, for the New Zealand
geologists would send their country 3000 feet up into
the air to allow the glaciers to descend to the present sea-
level, and lower it 2000 feet to permit the gravels of the
plains to be spread out, making a total movement of more
than 5000 feet; yet after these enormous imaginary oscilla-
tions, we find everywhere, as we do in England, the pre-
glacial shell beds with their littoral species only within a
a few feet of the present shore line.
Let us now turn to the consideration of the question of
the origin of the great plains of drift and silt that border the
eastern and southern coasts. Dr. Haast, in his able essay
on the structure and origin of the Canterbury Plains, con-
sidered that the gravels were the exuviae from the great
glaciers of the interior that had been spread out by the
floods produced whilst it was melting. Some serious objec-
tions have been urged against this view. The sheets of
gravel wrap around the hills, and are spiead right across
the water-sheds between different river systems. They are
nearly level for scores, or even hundreds of miles. Ranges
of hills are isolated so that they rise up from the plains like
islands out of the sea. The waters, necessary to overflow
such an extent of country, would be raging torrents, which,
instead of depositing sediments, would sweep everything
before them into the ocean ; and would be rather agents of
destruaion and denudation than of deposition above the sea-
'level There are beds of silt up to 800 feet above the sea-
level "at Banks?s Peninsula, and for the deposition of these
beds we require the presence of tranquil waters, and not
torrential floods. It may also be remarked that it is not
probable that, even on the hottest day, sufficient ice could
be melted to produce the quantity of water required to sub-
merge the countrv next the sea shore beneath a flood several
hundred feet deep. The very statement of the enormous
quantity of water required seems to condemn the theory
when we remember that every day the water produced
would be carried off, if near the sea there was nothing to
stop its outflow and dam it back.
These considerations have led the generality of New
Zealand geologists to adopt the theory that the great sea-
ward plains are of marine formation, and that the gravels,
sands, and loams were spread out when the land stood much


lower than now. The theory is the same as has been pro-
posed to account for the similar outspreads of sheets of
gravel and drift in other parts of the world in the Glacial
period, and the same objection is to be made to it ?the
absence of marine remains. In the case of New /Zealand,
the drift has not been found to contain even the broken and
worn sea shells that in Europe occur in some cases where
ice had advanced on the land from the sea, bringing some
of the productions of the latter with it.
If the theory is correct, the land must have sunk
nearly 2000 feet, to allow of the formation of the Canter-
bury Plains. As it was slowly sinking and rising again,
every portion of the area submerged would become a sea
beach, and pass through the different stages of shallow and
deep water; that at the present sea-level to a depth of about
2000 feet. As the land emerged, these stages would again
be passed through. Along these successive coast-lines
there would be bays and promontories, estuaries and sand
banks, rocky cliffs and pebbly beaches. We have evidence,
as Captain" Hutton has shown to us, that the mollusks
never left the shores. What then has become of their re-
mains ? We may grant that there must have been much
destruction of the old sea beds during the rise of the land,
but there ought to be some exceptions from that devastation,
and not total and supreme annihilation. The beds them-
selves have not been destroyed ; there are sheets of gravels,
sands, and clays, lying as they are supposed to have been
spread out during the submergence, but they contain no
marine organism. Contrast these with the pre-glacial beds
in the same districts, as, for instance, the clays and sands
on the coast at Wanganui and Oamaru. These teem with
sea shells, yet the unconsolidated sands and gravels of which
they consist have passed through all the vicissitudes of the
Glacial period. In Europe it is the same; the pre-glacial
marine beds at Cromer and elsewhere, often of loose sand,
are full of marine shells. We have also in Europe the post-
glacial raised beaches, as in Scotland, up to 50 feet, and in
Norway up to 600 feet above the sea-level, and these are
often so crowded with marine shells, that in Norway they
have been worked for many years for burning into lime.
We cannot believe that no life existed in these seas, for
we know that it abounds both in the ArCtic and Antarctic
regions up to the foot of the great ice-sheet. Dr. Hooker
states that along the shores of the Victoria Barrier
the soundings were invariably charged with diatoma-
ceous remains, that the water and the ice of the South


Polar ocean abound with them, and that they occur in
such myriads that where washed on the bergs or pack-ice
by the sea they stain it a pale ochreous colour. These
remains were detected along every ice-bound shore, and in
the depths of the adjoining ocean between 80 and 400
fathoms.* Nor is life in the polar regions restricted to these
minute organisms, for recent ArCtic explorations have proved
that mollusks and crustaceans swarm at the very foot of the
Greenland glaciers, and even to the north of Siberia where
the water is freshened by the great floods, poured into the
Arctic Ocean by the Obi and the Yenisei.
In New Zealand, Mr. Crawfurd has recognised the signi-
ficance of the absence of marine life in the deposits form-
ing the plains, and has suggested that they have been
spread out in great fresh-water lakes. To account for the
origin of these lakes he supposes that there was formerly
a barrier of land running down the south-eastern coast,
which has since entirely disappeared.t Agreeing as Ido
with Mr. Crawfurd, that the faCts he has brought forward
show that these deposits are not marine, it is difficult to
believe in the possibility of a ridge of land having been
elevated, since Pliocene times, along the whole coast of New
Zealand, to a height of 2000 feet, and utterly destroyed
since, so that not a vestige of it remains.
It will have been premised that I attribute the origin of
these deposits, as I have those of similar ones in South
America, to the advance of the Antarctic ice upon the coast
so as to block up the drainage of the land. The great
feature of the Glacial period is, of course, the enormous de-
velopment and accretion of ice, and to call in its aid appears
less hazardous than to invoke oscillations of the earth?s
crust, which, in our present ignorance of the condition of the
interior, may be impossible. Ido not hide from myself the
vast quantity of ice that is required on this supposition ; nor
the difficulty of accounting for its formation, and I have only
been driven very gradually and unwillingly to the conclusions
I now hold respecting its extent. In my last paper in this
Journal I endeavoured to show that in the North Atlantic
area the ice would accumulate most at the northern end of
that great evaporating basin ; that when it was heaped up
on Greenland to such a height as to intercept all the mois-
ture of the currents of air travelling northwards, the pre-
cipitation would take place on its southern slope only; and
* Flora Antardica, vol. ii., p. 503.

that the latter would advance southward, not only by flow-
ing glacier-like, but by the area of precipitation itself being
moved southward. A similar accumulation and extension
must, I think, have taken place in the Antarctic regions.
We have learnt that there is a great precipitation of snow
around the edge of the ice-sheet with which the Antarctic
continent, so far as we know, is covered ; but an equilibrium
has been attained between the forces concerned in its forma-
tion on the one hand, and its liquefaction on the other, so
that it does not now advance further.
In the Glacial period that equilibrium must have been
disturbed in favour of the accumulation of the ice, not
necessarily by greater cold, which would tend to lessen the
precipitation, but from some cause favouring a larger amount
of moisture reaching the polar regions, and falling there in
the form of snow. If this did occur, I believe that the ice
might obtain powers of accumulation and growth, where it
was fed by large evaporating areas, that might enable the
ice-sheets now nearly confined within the ArCtic and Ant-
arctic circles to advance upon and invade the temperate
regions; especially down the ocean depressions. I indicated
some of the causes of accretion in my last paper. The
currents of air travelling from the tropical and temperate
zones towards the Poles, such as the counter trade winds,
are charged with moisture which is precipitated when they
reach colder regions or encounter mountain-chains. Con-
fining ourselves to the southern hemisphere we find that
much of the moisture falls as rain in low latitudes, yet
that a certain proportion of it reaches the ArCtic circle, and
there falls as snow, and recuperates the ever-melting ice-
sheet. Let us suppose that some change took place by
which much more of this moisture would reach the southern
ice-sheet, such, for instance, as would probably be effected
if the obliquity of the ecliptic was increased. This, by
raising the temperature of the temperate zone, would cause
much more moisture to reach the southern ice-cap, and be
precipitated there so as to add to its extent and height. As
the edge of the ice-cap moved northward, it would gather to
itself not only the moisture that would have reached it in
its old position, but that which belonged to the area it now
occupied.
As I remarked in my last paper on the Atlantic Glacier,
but reversing the direction of its progress, it would be a
ridge of ice slowly advancing northward, and appropriating
the precipitation of the regions it invaded to aid in its
further progress. Its advance would be due to two causes,


the flow of the ice itself, and the area of frozen precipitation
being moved northward by the accretion on the northern
slope of the ice-sheet ; for when it had attained a certain
height above the sea-level it would intercept the whole of
the moisture of currents of air travelling over it, and cause
its precipitation on its northern slope, so that, as it advanced
further from the Pole, there would be more and more preci-
pitation, and its progress would only be ultimately checked
by it reaching a warm enough latitude to greatly increase
the liquefaction of the ice. The height of the ridge would
increase as it reached more temperate regions, as it would
primarily depend upon the altitude to which the moisture
was carried before it was precipitated, and this would
be greater the lower the latitude the ridge of ice at-
tained to.
I do not suppose that this ridge of ice, or the zone of
greatest frozen precipitation, ever reached to New Zealand
or to the Rio Plata, but only that the ice flowing from it did
so. The zone of greatest precipitation may have been
hundreds of miles farther south, and if anyone then could
have stood on the edge of the great ice-sheet he would have
seen to the south probably what appeared a level plain of
ice reaching to the horizon, so gradual would have been its
rise in that direction. M. Favre, in his elaborate account
of the old glaciers of the northern rivers of the Alps, has
proved that at their greatest extent the slope of the upper
surface of the ice was very small, and for great distances
nearly horizontal.* And Mr. Helland, describing the great
ice-sheet that covers North Greenland, states that it resem-
bles a great sea, but seems to rise slowly inland. Where the
glaciers are largest on the coast the rainfall is not consider-
able, and Mr. Helland concludes from this that the source
of the ice must be far in the interior.t In consequence of
this property of flowing with a small slope the ice has been
conveyed to the coast for more than a hundred miles, at
least, from where it was accumulated, and the whole of the
lower part of its course is far below the limits of perpetual
snow. The coast of Greenland does not, therefore, owe its
icy mantle to the climate there, but to the outflow from the
snow-gathering grounds of the far interior. And in the
Glacial period the neighbourhood of Lyons was glaciated
by ice that had flowed from the far distant Alps, and which
in a great part of its course was nearly horizontal on its
upper surface.

Judging from what we know of the slope of the upper
surfaces of the present ice-sheets of Greenland and Spits-
bergen, and from the marks left by the old Alpine glaciers,
we shall not, I think, be justified in allowing the still larger
circumpolar ice-sheets a greater surface slope than 1 in 200;
and supposing that the ice was 2000 feet higher than the
present level of the sea, when it reached New Zealand, we
should have to go back in the direction from which it flowed
more than 200 miles before we reached a height of Bcoo feet
above the present sea-level, which may have been the zone
of greatest precipitation.
Prof. Tyndall, in his well-known and often-quoted ob-
servations on the Glacial period, has so forcibly and clearly
defined some of the necessary conditions to allow of a great
accumulation of ice, that I may be allowed again to refer to
them. He shows that the ancient glaciers required for their
formation that water should be evaporated by heat, and that
by lessening the force of the sun?s rays we should not increase
the glaciers, but cut them off at their source ; and he illus-
trates this by referring to a distilling apparatus, and re-
minding us that if we wished to increase the quantity
distilled we should certainly not attain our objeCt by
reducing the fire under our boiler. ?It is quite manifest,?
he says, ? that the thing most needed to produce the gla-
ciers is an improved condenser; we cannot afford to lose an
iota of solar aCtion ; we need, if anything, more vapour,
but we need a condenser so powerful that this vapour,
instead of falling in liquid showers to the earth, shall be so
far reduced in temperature as to descend in snow.?* If the
theory I am advocating is corredt the great condenser that-
exists within the Antardtic circle moved northward, and as
it so moved the vapour to be condensed increased in quan-
tity, for the reasons I have already given. It was prevented
from falling in liquid showers, though it did not reach the
earth as snow, but as ice flowing from the icy ridge that
was fed and capped with snow.
Air, as it rises, expands, and much of its heat becomes
latent, so that it is cooled according to a definite and well-
ascertained law. To speak popularly, there is an inex-
haustible store of cold up above, available for glaciation, if
it could only be brought down.f The vapour in the air is
chilled when it rises to a great height through the abstraction
of its heat by the expanding air. The vapour is thus con-
densed, and at high altitudes frozen, so that it falls as snow.
* Heat as a Mode of Motion, p. 188.
f I am indebted to Prof. Joseph Henry, of Washington, for this suggestion.


Most of this snow is again liquefied before it reaches the
earth by the higher temperature of the lower portions of
the atmosphere it has to pass through. But if it be inter-
cepted above, on a mountain range, it may accumulate there
and feed glaciers that descend for thousands of feet below
the snow-line. In its descent, in this form, only its upper
surface is exposed to the warm air, and the lower portions
of the mass are preserved as in an ice-house. Thus, gla-
ciers may be said to bring down the cold of the upper
regions of the atmosphere, and the advance of a ridge of
ice from the north and south into the temperate zones, in
the Glacial period, would give us the machinery for doing
this on a scale commensurate with the extent of the glacia-
tion of the two hemispheres.
According to this theory, the ice that reached the coasts
of New Zealand and South America was not due to a great
lowering of the mean temperature of these countries, but
flowed down upon them, bringing with it the cold of regions
thousands of feet above the sea-level and hundreds of miles
to the southward. The theories of local glaciation require
a much greater change of climate than this does, just as in
the valley of Chamoinix a very considerable lowering of the
present mean temperature would be necessary to cause ice
to accumulate there, instead of flowing down to it from
Mont Blanc. In all the treatises on the Glacial period
that I have seen, the question sought to be answered is?
? What causes would bring about changes of climate to
allow perennial snow to accumulate on lands in temperate
regions. Instead of this, I think the problem to be solved
is?What are the conditions that would cause ice to be
piled up around the Ardtic and Antarctic circles, and gra-
dually invade the temperate zones, bringing down the cold
of the upper regions of the atmosphere as it progressed ?
I shall not now attempt to answer this question, but occupy
what space I have left in showing how such an advance of
ice explains the fadfs we have been considering in the
southern hemisphere and some others in this part of the
world.
The advance of the ice from the Antardtic regions would
not be diredfly southward. The moist winds that it
blew from the north-west, and its progress would bdtethe
south-east towards its source of supply. And as the quan-
tity of moisture in the air would be greater in some regions
than in others, owing to the irregular distribution of land
and water to the northward, the progress of the ice would
not be equal all around the Antardfic, but some parts would


be greatly in advance of others. In both New Zealand and
Patagonia there are wide plains to the east and a coast
indented with deep fiords to the west. It is certainly a
curious circumstance that we have similar fa<sts of glaciation
in two countries so far removed, unless they were due to
general and not to local causes. The advance of an ice-
sheet from the south-east accounts for the phenomena ; the
drainage of the eastern coasts would be obstructed, whilst
local glaciers would form, or be greatly increased where they
now exist, by the precipitation of frozen moisture from the
Boqrth-west winds when the mountains were raised by the
lowering of the ocean-level, 2000 feet higher above the sea
than they now stand.
Excepting the formation of the plains, I do not know of
any evidence in South America of the advance of the ice
upon the eastern coast ; but in New Zealand Capt. Hutton
has described an immense accumulation of clay containing
angular blocks of mica-schist, many of large size, on the
eastern or coast side of the Taieri Plain, and extending
from the Taieri River nearly to Otakaia, a distance of about
3 miles. This deposit is many miles to the eastward of any
known extension of the inland glaciers, and Capt. Hutton
ascribes its origin to an earlier glacier period than the last.
He says that there is a similar mica-schist on the sea-coast
at Brighton, but rejects the supposition that they could
have come from thence, because ?many of the blocks are
considerably above the highest level of the mica-schists
there, and there is no conceivable agency by which they
could have been brought from there.?* The formation of
this morainic deposit, and the transport of blocks of mica-
schist inland, so difficult to account for by the extension of
local glaciers, is just what we might expedf on the theory of
the advance of the ice from the south-east. No broken shells
have been found in this deposit, such as mark, in other parts
of the world, the drift left by glaciers that had crossed ocean-
beds ; but perhaps further examination may detedf them.
It may be said, in regard to the formation of great
lakes of fresh water by the advance of such enormous
masses of ice upon the coasts, that the cold would be suffi-
cient to freeze the lakes themselves and change them to
masses of solid ice. But a minute?s consideration will re-
move this objection. The temperature of the ice when it
reached the coasts of New Zealand and South America
would be little, if anything, below the freezing-point, and it
* Geology and Gold-Fields of Otago, p. 62.


would be melting itself instead of freezing the water it came
in contact with. There is no more reason for the lakes it
caused being frozen than that the Manjalen Sea ?which is
formed in a similar way ?should be so.
The advance of the circumpolar ice-sheets in the form of
low ridges, rising very gradually from their outer edges and
culminating at a height of perhaps not more than 8000 or
10,000 feet above the present level of the sea, and then de-
creasing in height towards the Poles again, in consequence
of the moisture being precipitated on the outer slopes, is, I
think, more in accordance with our experience than the
usual form of the theory of ice-caps, which would make
them highest at the Poles. The latter supposition, it has
been shown, is opposed to the fadts that the ice flowed
northward from the northern end of Scandinavia; that the
high peaks of the Lofoden Isles are not glaciated ; and
especially that at the present time the northern end of
Greenland is much more free from ice than the southern
extremity. Whilst every inlet of South Greenland is occu-
pied by ice flowing from the interior, and breaking off into
great bergs when it arrives at sufficiently deep water, in the
extreme north the glaciers do not reach the level of the sea.
And in the Glacial period, instead of there being more ice
than now within the Ardtic and Antardtic circles, there was
probably much less. Within the ridge of ice that then, I
think, irregularly encircled the southern hemisphere, and, in
the northern, bridged across the northern ends of the
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, both plants and animals that
could hybernate through the severe and long winters might
have existed in greater abundance than now. Even now,
in the Antardtic, behind the ridge of ice that' surrounds the
South Polar continent, it is possible that there may be large
areas of land free from ice in summer, and supporting a flora
and fauna, which, if they could be studied, might throw
much light on the distribution of animal and vegetable life
in the South Temperate zone. And were that barrier of ice
once passed a journey to the South Pole might be found to
be less impradticable than one to the northern extremity of
the globe.
Whilst the physical phenomena of the Glacial period in
New Zealand and South America are so similar, there are
differences in its effedt on the pre-glacial fauna that must be
noticed. Although there was great destrudtion of life
amongst the individuals of the great apterous birds of New
Zealand, there was not the same extirpation of species as


in America, nor even so much as in Europe amongst the
great mammals. Numerous bones of the moas are found in
the stratified deposits of the plains, but the same species
reappear in the post-glacial surface-beds. Their complete
destruction did not take place at the same time as the
megatherium and its associates in America, or the mammoth
and the woolly rhinoceros in Europe, but must rather be
correlated with that of the Irish elk and the American
mastodon. The preservation of the large birds through the
great vicissitudes of the Glacial period may have been owing
to the following causes : ?Long before the ice from the
Antaraic reached the coasts of New Zealand, a great stretch
of land to the north would be laid dry by the lowering of
the sea-level, so that there was possibly more space suitable
for their occupation during the greatest extension of the ice
than now. The same lowering of the sea-level took place
all over the world, and in South America a similar extension
of land surface must have ensued ; but there the new land,
to the north of the districts glaciated or submerged beneath
the waters of the great glacial lake, would be occupied by
northern animals who would resist the immigration of those
fleeing the catastrophes of the south. In New Zealand,
also, there was not the same competition with smaller ani-
mals, which appears to have led to the extirpation of many
of the bulky species of the continents during the changing
conditions of the Glacial period. Had, for instance, New
Zealand at that time become connected with Australia, the
great extension of area thus obtained, instead of tending
to the preservation of the moas, would have probably led
to their extermination by bringing them into competition
with the marsupials of the continent. But a channel,
2600 fathoms deep, separates the two countries ; and that
there was then no land connection between them is evi-
denced by the absence of the gum-trees and acacias of
Australia from the flora of New Zealand, and of the marsu-
pials, the cockatoos, the grass parroquets, and the pigeons
of the former from its fauna.
Although the large apterous birds of New Zealand were
not exterminated during the great glaciation of the country,
there are other signs of the impoverishment of its fauna.
About 200 species of beetles had been described in 1872,
and these belonged to no less than no genera, giving an
average of less than two species to each genus. Many of
the species live also in Australia, or have nearly allied forms
there. The great paucity of inseCts, the isolation of the
species, and their affinity with those of Tasmania and


Australia, is probably due to a great destruction of the
native species during the Glacial period, and the arrival
since of several from the countries to the north-west. Ido
not know how else some of the faCts can be explained, such
as that of there being only eight butterflies, and amongst
these some of wide distribution ; and that of the Hete-
roptera there are thirteen known species belonging to thirteen
different genera and nine distinct families.* Such gaps as
these in the fauna of a country are as significant as the
grooved and polished surfaces of its rocks, and the naturalist
may as surely point to the evidences of the Glacial period
as the geologist.
Mr. Wallace has also drawn attention to the large
destruction of species of inseCts in the Chilian sub-region,
evidenced by the great number of peculiar genera of beetles
of extremely isolated forms, and I might multiply instances
from the faunas and floras of southern lands, all tending to
the conclusion that the southern hemisphere has been gla-
ciated as much as, or more than, the northern ; but I could
not do justice to this phase of the question within the limits
of this article, and I have only glanced at some of its most
salient points with the objeCt of indicating that the physical
evidence of glaciation does not stand alone, but is strength-
ened by that of the present distribution of animal and
vegetable life.
