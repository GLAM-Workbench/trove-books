Prayers.
flDorntna prater.
O God, our heavenly Father, we thank Thee
for Thy goodness to us during the past night ; for
protection, rest and sleep, and all the blessings of
Thy love. Be with us throughout this day. Keep us
from evil, and in time of temptation and trial help
us to remember that we are Thy children, and that
Thou wilt never leave us nor forsake us , through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Evening prater.
We beseech T. hee, Lord, to behold us with
favour, weak men subsisting under the covert of
Thy patience. Be patient still ; suffer us yet a
while longer;-with our broken purposes of good, with
our idle endeavors against evil, suffer us a while
longer to endure and help us to do better. Bless
to us our extraordinary mercies ; if the day come
when these must be taken, brace us to play the
man under affliction. Be w T ith our friends, be
with ourselves. Go with each of us to rest , if any
awake, temper to them the dark hours of watching ;
and when the day returns, return to us, our Sun
and Comforter, and call us up with morning
faces and with morning hearts —eager to labour
eager to be happy, if happiness shall be our portion
—and if the day be marked for sorrow, strong to
endure it; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
Prayer of R. L. Stevenson.


IP taper of Confession,
Almighty God, the Fountain of all goodness,
who knowest the thoughts of our hearts, we
confess that we have sinned against Thee, and
done evil in Thy sight. But, 0 Lord, Thy pity
exceedeth the greatness of our sin, and in Thy
sure mercy is our hope. Pardon, we beseech Thee,
those things we have done contrary to Thy law,
and forgive us for loving darkness rather than
light. Cleanse us from the stains of our past sins
and give us strength to overcome the temptations of
evil. Keep us ever near Thee, that in Thy
presence we may bring forth fruit worthy of
repentance; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
prater for jprienbe.
almighty God, who art not far from any one of
us, we commend to Thy fatherly care all those
whom we love and who Jove us. Protect and keep
them from all danger in body and soul.
Prosper and bless them in all things that are
good ; suffer them never to be lonely, desolate
or afraid ; let no shadow come between them
and us to divide our hearts ; and grant that we
may soon meet together, with joy and not with
grief, to thank Thee for all Thy mercies, in Christ
fesus our Lord. Amen.


IPra\>cv in £tmc of Mar.
O Lord God, of infinite mercy, we humbly be-
seech Thee to look down in compassion upon our
Empire now involved in war. Reckon not against
us our many iniquities, pardon our offences, our
pride and arrogance, our self sufficiency and
forgetfulness of Thee. Save and defend oui
gracious King. Give wisdom to his counsellors,
skill to his officers, courage and endurance to his
soldiers and sailors ; and grant victory to our arms.
Look in mercy on those immediately exposed to
peril, conflict, sickness, and death. Comfort the
prisoners, relieve the sufferings of the wounded,
and show mercy to the dying. Give power, wis-
dom, and gentleness to all Thy ministering ser-
vants, all physicians,- and surgeons, nurses and
watchers of the sick that always bearing Thy pre-
sence with them,-they may not only heal but bless.
Finally we beseech Thee to remove, in Thy good
providence, all causes and occasions of war; and
of Thy great goodness to restore peace among the
nations j through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.


prater for the Hrmp.
O Lord God, high and mighty, who does! Thy
will in the army of heaven and amongst the in-
habitants of the earth ; stretch forth the shield of
Thy most merciful protection over us Thy servants,
and the Army in which we serve. Lead us and guide
us evermore by the Counsel of Thy goodness ;
strengthen and defend us with Thy might; that
we may steadfastly continue an honour and bul-
wark of our Empire, a terror to evil doers, and a
sure defence against every enemy ; and finally,
having quitted ourselves like men, and as good
soldiers of the Lord Jesus, may we enter into Thy
eternal glory ; through Him who is our only De-
livei'er and the Captain of our Salvation, Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.
prater Before Battle.
Almighty, and most merciful Father, we commit
ourselves, and all our friends to Thy loving care.
Be with us in the time of danger. Bestow upon us,
the strength and courage needed for the duties that
lie before us. Grant to us Thy fear that we may
fear Thee only ; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Xorb's prater.
Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be
Thy Name, Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil;
For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, for ever. Amen.


Hymns.
. PSALM 100
*•
1 All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.
2 Know that the Lord is God indeed ;
Without our aid He did us make :
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
3 O enter then His gates with praise,
Approach,with joy His courts unto :
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
4 For why ? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
PSALM 23.
2.
1 The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want.
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green : He leadeth me
the quiet waters by.
2 My soul He doth restore again ;
and me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
ev’n for His own Name’s sake.


3 Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale,
yet will I fear none ill :
For Thou art with me ; and Thy rod
and staff me comfort still.
4 My table Thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes ;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.
5 Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me :
And in God’s house for evermore
my dwelling-place shall be.
C.H. 477-
rs mf 1 Our God, our help in ages past.
Our hope for years to come.
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home,
m 2 Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
m/3 Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
mp 4 A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone,
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
5 Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten; as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
m/6 Our God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while troubles last.
And our eternal home. Amen.


4. C.H. 294

Hast all our fathers led,

Before Thy throne of grace ;
God of our fathers, be the God
Of their succeeding race.
3 Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide ;
Give us each day our daily bread,
And raiment fit provide.
4 O spread Thy covering wings around,
Till all our wanderings cease.
And at our Father’s loved abode
Our souls arrive in peace.

And portion evermore.

The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
To whom be praise for evermore.
m 2 For life and love, for rest and food,
For daily help and nightly care,
mf Sing to the Lord, for He is good,
And praise His name, for it is fair.


m 3 For strength to those who on Him wait
His truth to prove, His will to do,
mf Praise ye our God, for He is great,
Trust in His name, for it is true.

m i Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee ;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure :
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
2 Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands ;
Could my zeal no respite know.
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone :
c Thou must save, and Thou alone.
mp 3 Nothing in my hand I bring,
' Simply to Thy cross I cling ;
Naked, come to Thee for dress ;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace ;
Foul, I to the fountain fly ;
c Wash me, Saviour, [d, or I die).
d 4 While I draw this fleeting breath,
pp When my eyelids close in death,
When I soar through tracts unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
c Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.


7. C.H. 175.
P Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd’st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come.
2 Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come.
3 Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come.
4 Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind,
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come.
m 5 Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
. Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve ;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come.
6 Just as I am—Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down—
mf Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come.
7 Just as I am, of that free love
The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove.
Here for a season, then above,
O Lamb of God, I come.
AMEN.

Nearer to Thee !
Even though it be a cross
That raiseth me,


c Still all my song would be,
' Nearer, my God, to Thee,
d Nearer to Thee ! ’

The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
d Nearer to Thee !
m 3 There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven,
All that Thou send’st to me
In mercy given,
Angels to beckon me
c Nearer, my God, to Thee,
d Nearer to Thee !
w?/4 Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I’ll raise—
c So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
d Nearer to Thee !
w/5 Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun. moon, and stars forgot,
Upwards I fly,
Still all my song shall be,
c ' Nearer, my God, to Thee,
d Nearer to Thee ! ’
AMEN.

Fiends may look like angels bright ;
Trust no custom, school, or fashion :

Some will flatter, some will slight;
mf Cease from man, and look above thee :
Trust in God, and do the right.

mpi Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead Thou me on ;
The night is dark, and I am far from home ;
Lead Thou me on.
m Keep Thou my feet; Ido not ask to see
The distant scene, —one step enough for me.
mp 2 I was not ever thus, nor prayed that Thou
Shouldst lead me on ;
I loved to choose and see my path, but now
Lead Thou me on ;
I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will : {p) remember not past years.
m/3 So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone,
And with the morn those angel faces smile
d Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

O receive my soul at last !

Hangs my helpless soul on Thee ;
Leave, ah ! leave me not alone ;
Still support and comfort me.

All my help from Thee I bring ;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.
m/3 Thou, O Christ, art all I want ;
More than all in Thee I find ;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and Holy is Thy name,
p I am all unrighteousness ;
False and full of sin I am,
m Thou art full of truth and grace.
m/4 Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin ;
Let the healing streams abound ;
Make and keep me pure within.
/ Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee ;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.

mp 1 O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee :
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.
rn 2 O Light that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee ;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brigther, fairer be.
mp 3 O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee :
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.


p 4 O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Thee :
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.

Onward goes the pilgrim band,
Singing songs of expectation,
Marching to the promised land.

Gleams and burns the guiding light;
Brother clasps the hand of brother.
Stepping fearless through the night;

O’er His ransomed people shed,
Chasing far the gloom and terror,
Brightening all the path we tread ;
4 One the object of our journey,
One the faith which never tires,
One the earnest looking forward,
One the hope our God inspires ;
5 One the strain that lips of thousands
Lift as from the heart of one ;
One the conflict, one the peril,
One the march in God begun ;
m/6 One the gladness of rejoicing
On the far eternal shore,
Where the one almighty father
Reigns in love for evermore.
7 Soon shall come the glad awaking,
Then the rending of the tomb,
Then the scattering of all shadows
And the end of toil and gloom.
