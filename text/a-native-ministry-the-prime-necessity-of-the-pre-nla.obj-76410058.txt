A NATIVE MINISTRY?THE PRIME NEOES.
SITY OE THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
Being an Address Delivered in the Presbyterian
Church (Rev. Dr. Steel?s), Macquaeib-street,
Sydney, by the Rev. Dr. Lang, M.L.A., in
the Evening oe Monday, the 18th June, 1866
As the General Assembly ef the Presbyterian Church
has resolved to appropriate the sum of a thousand
peunds (which I am happy to say has been already
realised), for the payment of the passage out of ten'
additional ministers from the mother-country, at the'
rate of a hundred pounds fer each, it has become a matter
of interest and importance for all who are well affected
towards the hallowed institutions of our mother church
and our fatherland, to ascertain, as far as possible,
what are the prospects of our colonial church generally,
and more especially under this temporary arrangement,
in regard to the future supply of the ordinances ef reli-
gion for the widely scattered members of our com-
munion throughout this vast territory. lu looking
therefore for the requisite supply of ministers from
the mother-country, we have in the first instance to
take cognisance of the fact that the proportion of candi-
dates for the ministry throughout the Presbyterian
Churches in Scotland, as compared with the general
population of the country is now much smaller than
it was fifty years ago, that is, when I was myself a
student of divinity at tte University of Glasgow. At
that period the common remark of candidates for the
ministry, when estimating the probabilities of their
own future settlement in the church, was not one
generation of ministers goeth another oometh, but one
goeth and two are coming. But the wonderful de-
velopment of the material interests of Scotland, in all
the different fields of industry, during the last half
century, has greatly changed this state of things, and
diminished, in great measure, the proportion of candi-
dates for the ministry to the general
population, there being now far more numerous and
far more eligible openings than there were then for
young men of ability and enterprise in the mining,
engineering, manufacturing, ship-building, and general
commercial operations of the country; and the con-
sequence has been that, while the general population
has greatly increased, the proportion of candidates for
the ministry has very seriously diminished. This re-
markable development of the material interests of the
mother country, and particularly of Scotland, has given
a prodigious impulse to tte worship of Mammou,
both at home and abroad, during the last half-century,
as compared with the state of things at an earlier
period, and has thereby unquestionably exerted a
strongly deteriorating influence on the Presby-
terian Church. It is a saying of the evan-
gelical prophet under a somewhat similar
stats of things in Judeah: ?? The ways
of Zion do mourn, because few come to the solemn
feasts.? Another important subject for consideration
in this matter is that tte demand for ministers from the
mother-country is at present much greater, and the field
for their occupation and settlement much more exten-
sive than it has ever been before. Besides the greatly
increased demand for the home churches, arising from
the increase of population and tte extraordinary de-
velopment of the material interests of the country, the
colonial field is now, beyond all former precedent, vast
and extensive. There are the North American colonies,
an extensive group, with a population of from three to
four millions. The Australian colonies and New Zea-
land, equally extensive, although not yet so populous,
with all the other minor transmarine settlements
ot the empire all urging their respective
claims simultaneously, and all pleading
their transoendant importance. As it was
in tho days of the earthly ministry of the Saviour,
" The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are
few.? And in regard to tte sources of supply, it may
well be said ? There is a lad here who has five barley
loaves and two small fishes; but what are these among
60 many ?? It cannot be denied also that there is a
singular lack of enterprise and self-devotion at present
in the rising ministry of the Presbyterian Church in
Scotland in all its sections. Instead of the noble am-
bition of Paul, the apostle, to labour where no other
man had laboured?instead of his indignant refusal to
build on another man?s foundation, or to enter upon
another man?s line of things made ready to his hand,
the ambition of our first and second class men
of the rising ministry at home, is by all means to
get into what may be called tte snuggeries of the
ehuroh, and to step, as easily as possible, into other and
generally dead men?s shoes?insomuch that there is
virtually just as great a striving among our first and
second class men for the chief seats in the synagogues
at home, as there was among the Pharisees of old, while
there is unquestionably a corresponding reluctance to go
forth to the help of the Lord into the high places of
the foreign or colonial field. And the consequence is
that in negotiating for supplies for the colonies we are
thrown for the most part (for there are honourable ex-
ceptions) upon the inferior portions of the rising minis-
try, with whom, unfortunately, the question too often
is, not what or where is tte field ? but our characteristic
national question, What?ll ye gie? ? We are therefore
compelled, so to speak, to go into the ecclesiastical
market for the colonies with a promise to pay in our
hands, and to bid against each other for the available
supply, like people at a roup or auction. In fact, the
Victorians, being a tegular go ahead people,
both in Church and State, are actually bid
ding above us; offering a guarantee for �3OO
a year, which I am credibly informed is not
always Paid, while we only offer �2OO What the
New Zealand or Canadian bids are I have not ascertained.
Besides, there are men of fair, although by no means
�f first-rate qualifications for the Christian ministry,
who have so overweening an idea of their own merits,
and who form so depreciating an estimate of everything
colonial, as not to be satisfied with such arrangements
as those I have indicated on the part of the colonies.
I have a case of the kind at this moment in my eye,
although I shall mention no names. A minister who
had been brought out with funds sent home from, the
colony, and who had a salary of �3OO a-year regularly
paid him from the time of his arrival, getting dissatis-
fied with his situation, nobody knew why, threw up
his appointment, on the most frivolous pretences,
at the close of the very first year of his
engagement, and went to Victoria, expecting, ot
course, to obtain a much better appointment there. But
St seems he was disappointed, and was glad to accept ot
a call to Queensland, where tte committee of manage-
ment of a Presbyterian congregation, after paying his
expenses from Melbourne, not only guaranteed and paid
him � salary ot �3OO a year, but erected a hands uno
ehurch for him ; thereby burdening themselves with a
bad debt, ef which tte very interest amounts to .up-
wards ot �7O a-year. But he had no sooner completed
the first year of his engagement in Queensland, than
he threw up his appointment with his second congrega-
tion, precisely as had done with his first, on the most
frivolous pretences, leaving his flock in the wilder-
ness, without a shepherd, to shift for themselves.
In addition to all these considerations, you must doubt-
less be aware that the difficulty of en-
suring an adequate supply of acceptable
ministers from the mother-country for this
colony must be greatly enhanced by the long-continued
and systematic efforts of a portion of the press here
to misrepresent, to vilify, and to degrade the colony and
its institutions in tte estimation of the public at home.
From what came to my �wu knowledge, as well as
from my own observation, when last in England, of the
evil effects of this hostile influence, I have no hesita-
tes. in expressing my belief and conviction that it has
/tended to lower the colony prodigiously in the estima-
tion of the public at home, and to repel intending
emigrants of all classes, including ministers of re-
ligion, from our shores. As the poet says (although I
can scarcely give his exact words) ?
Who steals my purse steals trash
'Twas mine ; ?tis his, and has been slave to thousands :
But he who filches from me my good name,
Bobs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.
Under the circumstances I have mentioned, I Confess
I am not very sanguine as to the general results ef the
arrangement to whioh I have already alluded ?I mean
the sending homo for ten additional ministers frem the
mother-country. But whether that arrangement should
be attended with the results anticipated from it or not,
i{ is clearly our duty as a church of Christ ?instead of
depending any longer for a supply of ministers for our
Colonial church from the mother country ?to make
immediate and effectual provision for the training up of
a native ministry Without such provision and the
educational machinery whioh it implies? without
having a school of the prophets in her midst?no
church can expect to prosper in the present age. There
are peculiarities in the physical character of every
country, as well as in the social condition, in the bodily
and mental training, and in the views and feelings of
every community, to whioh a stranger from beyond seas
can never accommodate himself so easily kindly
as a native. I found, for example, in the United States
of America that ministers from the old country were
generally long in getting naturalised, so to speak, in
their adopted country, while many could never accom-
modate themselves at all to a state of things so entirely
new to them. Nay, at one of the great May meetings
in New York I learned, on the authority _ of an
eminent minister from the far west in that
country, that young men from the Eastern
States, however zealous and well-trained, were
neither so acceptable nor so well fitted for the
peculiar work of the ministry in the great valley of the
Mississippi as those, even of inferior qualifications
otherwise, who had been born and bred among them-
selves. I recollect the case of a young minister from
the Nor hof Scotland, long since deceased, who came
out to this country many years ago, and was settled for
a time in the Hunter?s River district. Living, as he
did, for a short period on the estate of a respectable
settler not long out in the country himself, I suppose
his temporary habitation was a slab hut, covered with
bark, with the bare earth perhaps for a floor, without
glass windows, and with both light and fresh air enter-
ing everywhere between tte slabs?the usual style of
colonial habitations in the first instance in the bush.
But what a lugubrious letter the unfortunate
young man wrote on the subject to his
friends at home. It would have broken your hearts to
hear it. The place he was living in, was such as no
farm servant at home would consent to live in?it was
no better than a dog kennel! But he forgot to tell
his friends what a delicious climate he was living in,
as compared with that of the North of Scotland, espe-
ially in winter. He forgot to tell them that real
gentlemen, university bred men, of aristocratic families
at home, were living around him in precisely the same
style and in the same way. I recollect of asking one
of these gentlemen settlers (a fellow passenger with
myself from England, and a graduate of Trinity Col-
lege, Dublin), who had been describing to me the sort
of habitation he had reared for himself in the wilder-
ness, with the stools and benches he had to sit and
sleep on, how he did for a table. ? Oh,? he replied,
?J we just take the door of tte hut off the hinges,
and place it on two tresseis, and it makes
an excellent table.? Now these scenes and circum-
stances of colonial life, however strange, and it may he
undesirable, they may appear to some delicate impor-
tation from the old country, will all come as a matter
of course, and quite naturally, to a native of the
colony. Entertaining, as I did, the views and opinions
to which I have just given expression, in regard to the
difficulties in the way of getting eut suitable ministers
from home, twenty-five years ago, and knowing that
there were then several college-bred men _in
Sydney, who could devote themselves to the training
up of a native ministry in this city, from
amongst the youth of our communion throughout
the colony, provided that moderate salaries could be
ensured to them for the purpose; and knowing also
that the Presbyterians of Port Phillip, and Van
Diemen?s Land, who were in precisely the same circum-
stances as to getting out ministers as ourselves, would
in all likelihood be willing to co-operate with us for so
praiseworthy an object, I proceeded, after making tte
necessary arrangements for my own temporary absence
from Sydney, first to Melbourne, and then to Launces-
ton, and Hobart Town, Van Diemen?s Land; assisting
at the dispensation of the Communion in two of these
places, and holding publio meetings of the
Presbyterians in ail the three?to impress
upon them the transoendant importance
of the object in view, and to solicit their co-operation
for its accomplishment. And what do you
think was the result of this appeal? Why,
I was only five weeks away, being back in
Sydney before the sixth Sabbath ; and during that short
period, I had obtained in Melbourne, Launceston, and
Hobort Town, before asking for a single sixpence in
New Smth Wales, reliable guarantees for �4OO a year
for four years, towards the support ot three well quali-
fied and university bred men, to be employed in train-
ing up a native ministry in Sydney for all these Aus-
tralian colonies; one gentleman, since deceased, then a
member of the Legislative Council of Van Diemen?s
Land, contributing not less than �35 a year, as his pro-
portion of the fund. One might have thought that so
important a service as had thus been rendered to the
Presbyterian Church of these colonies would have been
hailed with delight by all well-affected members
of our communion, and that immediate efforts would
have been made in Sydney and elsewhere throughout
this colony, to carry out, in conjunction with these
generous friends in the south, tte great object in which
we were all so deeply interested. But strange, and
even incredible as it may seem, it is nevertheless the
fact that all that had thus been done in Melbourne,
Launceston, and Hobart Town, was studiously ignored
in Sydney, that tte contributions from these quarters
were never mentioned,, and that instead of any efforts
being made in furtherance of tte common object, a formal
charge was, at tte instance of two members of the
court, of whom one is since deceased, and the other is
no longer in the colony, brought up against me for
having gone to Melbourne without the previous per-
mission of tte Presbytery. And while all the otter
interests in the case were postponed and neglected,
this charge was prosecuted with as much
earnestness as if I had been guilty of
some heinous offence. Now it is one of the laws of
the Presbyterian Church that a minister, provided he
has made satisfactory provision for the discharge of
his clerical duties during his absence, may be absent
from his parish or usual field of labour for any period
less than six weeks, without the permission of his
Presbytery being either asked or required. And as I
had not only returned to my post within that period,
but had obtained the consent and concurrence of my
elders and committee of management previous to my
leaving, all of whioh was unknown to my accusers, tte
charge against me fell to the ground. But the display
of utter heartlessness which the whole affair exhibited,
and the entire want of interest whioh it showed in the
furtherance of an object of such transcendent import-
ance to our Church as tte training up of a native
ministry, convinced and satisfied me that the further
prosecution of that object was, in such circumstances,
utterly hopeless ; and the undertaking, so auspiciously
commenced, accordingly fell to the ground. Now, as I
withdrew from my brethren of that period very shortly
; thereafter, and thus left the field entire y clear for them already commenced in the English universities, and the
for any good object, I appeal to you as to whether any- virtual extrusion of the humbler classes from the gr. at
