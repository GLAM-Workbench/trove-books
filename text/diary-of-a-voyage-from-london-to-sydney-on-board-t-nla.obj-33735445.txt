DIARY OF A VOYAGE
LONDON TO SYDNEY
ON BOARD THE s.s. ?AUSTRAL,?
<3 p Jl. J. ?
FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION.
PRINTED BY JAMES WATSON, 159, HIGH STREET, ELGIN.
1885.




Would the many dear and kind friends whom I promised to
write, giving an account of my voyage to Sydney, accept of the
following as giving in fuller detail any experience of life on
board an Australian bound ? Orient Liner,? than could be
comprised in a considerable number of letters?
October, 1885.




DIARY.
Wednesday, 12th November, 1884 ? ?It was not without much
feeling of regret that I said good-bye to uncle and cousins at
Fenchurch Street Station this forenoon, and after a quick run to
Tilbury Station, Father and I went on board the steam tender to
take us to the Orient liner ? Austral.? As soon as we were along-
side the ?Austral? we heard the words, ?All passengers first;
friends after,? thus giving both friends and passengers a foretaste of
the last parting. Having looked well, but in vain, among the
passengers for a known face, 1 was much surprised to be asked
immediately I got on board the ? Austral? if I were Miss Watson.
I answered ?Yes,? and the young lady told me she was Miss
Hogg, whose brother I knew was coming on board as passenger
also. I was of course delighted, and Father too, as now we knew
I should not be quite alone. Of the last farewell I cannot write,
further than to say it was too sad and short, for the number of
passengers alone was almost sufficient to crowd the deck, but with
friends there was hardly moving room. The bell rang several
times for ? All friends ashore,? and though many lingered at the
risk of having to remain until being summarily sent off, yet the last
came too soon, and the tender was quickly loosed from us and
steamed away back to Tilbury. We saw this sad scene repeated
when the remaining passengers joined us at Plymouth, and it
reminded us of our own farewells. After tender left, wrote letters
until nine p.m., then went to bed.
Thursday, 13th. ?When I woke I found we had started down
the river, but I could not say that I knew whether the steamer
was really going or not. On going on deck I soon saw that we
had made a good start, and not long after I could distinctly
feel the effects of the motion on myself, but managed to keep on
deck. We had a splendid sight of the chalk cliffs of Dover, with


?the old church and lighthouse on the edge of the cliff and Dover
proper down in a hollow by the sea. Spent the most of the
evening writing letters for the mail for Plymouth, which was
reported to be closed at 6 - 30 p.m., but which was not really closed
until next morning. Run, 280 miles.
Friday, Hth. ?In sight for some time of the coast to east of
Plymouth, and a very beautiful rocky coast it is, with many dark
caves into which the sea ran right up. There is also a very pretty
wild and rocky island to the east of Plymouth pier, within which
we anchored at eight o?clock, just as we had snatched some
breakfast. In a few minutes several gentlemen passengers were
in a couple of small boats and off to Plymouth, for which the
charge was Is. to and Is. back by boatmen from the shore. It
was a good opportunity for many of the passengers to get things
at Plymouth that were forgotten at London. At 10?30 the
passenger tender came alongside, and at twelve o?clock all was
ready. As soon as the tender returned with the saddened friends
we started on our outward voyage. I was very happy to have
two letters from Plymouth, and now must rest content until Suez
is reached, when we hope for more. * At twelve midnight we were
opposite Cape Ushant, France. Run, 397 miles.
Saturday, 15th (12 noon ). ?ln the middle of the Bay of Biscay,
in which we had most beautiful sunny weather, but in which I
still felt inclined to be sick. In the evening we were getting well
on for passing out of the Bay, and next morning we were in sight
for a short time of the Portuguese coast. Run, 307 miles.
Sunday, 16th. ?Walked about on deck until dinner, after which
we had Presbyterian Church service in second saloon by the Rev.
Mr. Abemethy, the address and the preliminary lessons, &c., by a
young English Church clergyman; then a turn on deck and read
until tea time. After tea I went with one of the Saunders (Ada,
the youngest) down into the steerage to help them in singing some
hymns. We were invited by one of the gentlemen in the first
class, who told us they had permission from the Captain to have it.
It was a strange contrast to the afternoon meeting. At it, all were
seated comfortably, with beautiful light, prayer books and hymn
books; but at the third class and steerage we had to seat our-
selves on the deck as best we could?some on the ropes, others


on top of machinery, <fec., and in the dark, but the spirit in which
the singing was kept up showed quite as much earnestness and
sincerity, if not more, than in the second. After we had sung
some time at the stern of the vessel the meeting was adjourned to
a more central part in front of the smoking-room (second class),
where a few hymns were sung, amongst which most prominent
were?? Oh, think of the Home over there,? ?In the Sweet By-
and-By,? ? Abide with. Me.? After this, came downstaifs, wrote
a little, and then went on deck for a breath of fresh air before
turning in, and had talk with one of the stewards as to our where-
abouts now. This evening we saw the revolving light on the rocks
outside- Lisbon, which was all that was visible until we neared
Cape St. Vincent soon after breakfast next morning. Bun, 294
miles.
Monday, 17th.? Finished ?Called Back? during the forenoon,
and enjoyed it very much. Commenced my Tam o? Shanter,
which one young gentleman begged hard to have, even to going
down on his knees before me that I might measure his head,
and this on the high deck before many passengers. We had
most beautiful weather and such beautiful scenery all along
the coast from St. Vincent Point until evening, when we came
in sight of the red light of Tarifa Point, east of ?the Gib.? St.
Vincent Point was most beautiful, the lighthouse being a very
large and old, even ancient-looking building, and built on the height
of the furthest out and highest promontory. Many clear and
beautiful bays along the high rocky shore. We could also see
several high snow-covered peaks far inland belonging to the Sierra
Nevada ranga We were very much disappointed to find that it
would be past midnight ere we should reach Gibraltar; nevertheless
several waited up, but it was not until nearly two o?clock that
we saw the long range of two sets of semi-ampitheatre rows of
lights and the dark rocky shore. Bun, 286 miles.
Tuesday, 18th. ?Woke this morning early, though late to bed.
Bead twenty pages of ? Dark Days? before breakfast. Discovered
when at breakfast that anchor had been cast and we had to lie up
until some of the machinery was repaired?a pump or something.
This caused a detention of about four hours, and during that time
several of us were feeling very, very squeamish, and had to walk


about to keep from being really sick. While lying here we saw
a great many ships between us and the Spanish coast, and the
snowy peaks of the Sierra Nevada all along the shore, clear
and shining above dense masses'of snowy clouds. One steamer
passed us from London for Suez and India, and there was great
consternation that she would report us lying up disabled. But
there was not much wrong; we were soon on our way again. I
have befti writing this a sentence at a time, and between each
sentence discussing various things with Mrs. Stanley and others,
and amqpgst our discussions comes in a hit at the canny Scotch,
and about their having to live on nothing but porridge, broth, and
caller herrin?, and the fashion of hanging out all the duds from
the high windows to dry as simply dreadful. The run to-day,
notwithstanding our loss of four hours, was 237 miles.
Wednesday, 19th. ?Got up and had nice cold'bath for first
time. Felt pretty well all the forenoon, and put off writing diary
until afternoon, but got ~very squeamish, and was only able to
remain on deck to see the African coast/ Very pretty in some
parts, with houses all scattered over the hill sides and several
lighthouse-looking towers or fortresses. About twelve o?clock
we passed Cape Bon, and were told at the time by one of the
middies that we were only 199 miles from Malta. (Afternoon). ?
Have just woke up from short nap on deck ; find a great many
have retired below, and that the few on deck have just seen a
waterspout ahead of us. This high deck is our constant resort,
and the company in our comer are usually Mr. and Mrs.
Saunders and their three daughters on their return journey to
Sydney; Mr. and Mrs. Over, going out for a trip, and two fellows
in company with them going out on ?spec.? up country. . The
elder of the latter told us all that they both wished a wife,
but could not afford to keep two; they would like one to do for
both, if they could get one. Afraid they won?t. Looking over
rails, we can see all the third class passengers walking round us,
and there are very many respectable-looking people amongst them.
There is a woman who has been in hospital almost ever since she
came on board. Two of her children have measles ; the others of
two, ten, and twelve are looking after themselves as best they can.
It is amusing how they play with the baby. They put her in a


rug and trail it from end to end of the deck at the bow of the
ship. I was with them a while this morning, and giving them
some sweets, they told me their mother and her two children
were to be out on Monday. The baby cries very much for ? Ma,
ma,? in the night, but is wonderfully happy and good during the
day. There is much going on I should like to write of, but this
sea sickness puts nearly all out of head. Last Sunday I felt quite
well and could have eaten anything, we were going along so
smoothly; but it is different now, and I don?t know whether it
was too much singing or the thought of the man who died from
delirium tremens on Saturday night and was buried on Sunday while
we were in the saloon at service that has most to do with the change.
We are going along pretty steadily just now, but it is so cold
sitting, must go and have a walk. Have had tea, and feel much
better. Have commenced letter for Port Said. Pun, 293 miles.
Thursday , 20th. ?In the morning, felt better. Had some
breakfast and got on deck, to find we were running some miles
south of the shores of Sicily. The country looked very pretty in
the distance, but on seeing it through a glass it seemed very dry,
sandy, and scrubby land?only brushwood evidently; few trees
on this side Sicily. Squeamish all the afternoon, and like a great
many more, had to turn in early owing to swell. Run, 299 miles.
Friday, 21st. ?Beautiful morning, but still rough sea and
heavy swell. Heavy rains came after us and passed on ahead.
Many still sick and scarcely able to do anything but lounge about.
Made several friends, amongst whom is a quiet ? Highland lad,?
who has asked me to be his partner for the grand ball at Port
Said on Monday evening. We are to be there on Monday at
two P.M., and have the afternoon to see about us ere we go to the
ball, of which the Captain is the head and proposer, and officers in
company. Mr. and Mrs. Over (Liverpool), going out for a trip,
are much amused at my not yet knowing the name of the Highland
laddie; but he is quite nice?better than any of about another
dozen I have talked to. , But I am not smitten with any one yet.
The great cry-out is that this ball was not mentioned last baggage
day, so as to have allowed us to take out ball gear; but we are to
go in whatever we like. Many in first class expected to join.
Ticket is ss. for gentleman and lady; or lady, 2s. fid. (optional).


There will in all probability be two gentlemen to each lady, as
there are many married and going out to be married on board.
Turned in early. Run, 307 miles.
Satwrday, 22nd. ?Have managed to keep on deck to-day, but
still cold and missing our wraps a little, for all were put in hold
last baggage day. Today no land in sight. Ship still rolling,
and getting worse this afternoon. Raining a little, so that they
say we missed this weather in the Bay and are getting it now.
Poor Miss Hogg is ordered to bed until we get into Port Said or
calmer water. Jt is very monotonous and rather wearisome on
board as yet; everyone is feeling sick more or less. lam not so
bad as several, and yet worse than a few. Feel it hard work to
do anything. Am afraid my letters for Port Said to many dear
and kindest of friends will be short or have to be postponed unless'
I get better. Everybody in same condition. Have good fun
sometimes when lying in my cabin listening to the stewards
washing up the dishes in the pantry opposite. One steward called
out to-day?? Oh! some fellow has been in a hurry or hungry
to-day; he has taken a bit out of this plate.? 1 felt inclined to
hollo back that it was in their hurry washing them that they
took the bits out of the plates. I find my pillow most useful, but
believe my style of chair helps sickness. Getting on much better
with my lady companion. She has been to the Doctor, but does
not like him?he is awfully conceited. So is the Purser, but he is
not quite such a ?muff? as the former. After tea we were all so
much better in health and eonsequently in spirits. At supper I
went to sit beside Mr. Saunders and family and Messrs. Weir and
Dicks, but went out again to fetch some of our Port Said
lemons, and before I got back my seat was taken, so I had to
be thankful to share the end sofa seat with Mr. Weir, and
evidently the waiter thought I was going to share supper with
him also, for he brought supper for two but on one plate.
We were all laughing and joking to our hearts? content when
some one quietly proposed some music, and another took up
the proposal more strongly and asked Mr. Blankley to give us a
song. At the same time one of the young ladies proposed that I
should sing also, and immediately Mr. Blankley came across to ask
me to sing. I declined, but he said all wished it, so I had no


objections if it made them the happier, though I was very nervous
over it. While I argued with Mr. Blankley, a great clapping and
cheering got up in the saloon, especially amongst the Scotch
fellows, I think, and when Mr. Blankley armed me to the piano
the noise was almost too much for my nerves. I sang ? Bide a
Wee,? and on getting a very hearty encore, gave ? Gin a Body,?
and got through all wonderfully well considering I had just
recovered from mod de mer. We had then a song from Mr.
Blankley, I playing the accompaniment and Herr Duchnitz the
violin to ? Here?s to the Freen?s that?s awa?,? and it was so pretty.
Run, 318 miles.
Sunday, 23rd. ?A beautiful morning, so that I joined the
order of the hath, dressed, and had a good turn on deck before
going below to have some fruthstuck. Feeling in excellent health
to-day and fit for any mischief if it had not been Sunday, but
restrained my fun until a more convenient season, and went to
beg or borrow a Sunday book from some of the passengers until
church time. Got one from Mr. Blankley entitled ?Thomas
Wingfield,? by George Mac Donald. Did not read much, as it was
getting near church time and I was going below to try over the
tunes for the psalms and hymns with Misses Galliers and Saunders,
to whom the numbers had been sent by the Rev. Mr. Abemethy.
As the hymns were not well known we had some difficulty in
getting through, and Miss Galliers played somewhat fast and
savouring rather of waltz style. Considering, however, that the
congregation had no hymn books, for they had them all at the
first class Church of England service, we managed to pull through
the singing wonderfully well. Had the usual and proverbial good
Sunday dinner?brown soup, roast duck, plum pudding, and apples.
There was also abundance of nuts, rasins, and figs, but I have no
particular taste for these. This afternoon, had a nice quiet read
for some time, but it was too good to last long, and so a little
written debate broke out in our party. During the afternoon I
had moved out of the family circle, taken up a seat more towards
the stem, and left my box of sweets (only a few left) beside the
Misses Saunders and Hogg and Messrs. Hogg, Blankley, Dicks,
& Co. They quietly finished the remaining few sweets, then filled
up the box with bits of orange skins and nut shells, addressed it


to Sweet Miss Watson, with fond love from Blankley, Dicks, & Co.
I read the address and called back that I thought the sweets were
the sweeter, but I did not think of opening the box. In a few
minutes afterwards I chanced to look into the box and saw what
it contained, and for fun let it fly back to them quicker than
they sent it, and it hit Mr. Blankley on the back. In return for
my kindness he sent me the following epistle composed on the spur
of the moment:?
? When on the calm but breezy sea
That pledge of love to you I sent,
I little thought that on my back
The fury of your rage you?d vent.
But such, alas ! your temper bad,
Your fierce dispute of this blest day,
That though the Sabbath should have taught
Your wanton soul to weep and pray,
You threw with force your hateful box
On one who loved you to the letter;
Yet my forgiveness you shall have,
If you but promise to do better.?
I could not think what to answer, so wrote back, ?I promise, if you
should help me ?to do better.?? In answer came the following :
?gl Ummg SSoman?s {ltemise.
? (liven in a moment by thought imperfected,
Heedless, unheeding, too light e?en to the last;
. Such is your promise, so rash, so excited,
That still of the future I judge of the past.?
To return the compliment, since that was all his faith in woman,
I let him know that mine was that ? there is little faith in man
on land and less at sea,? and here ended our Sunday lesson and
discussion. The approach of tea time soon cleared the deck of our
saloon friends, or rather strangers yet in everything but sight, so
we all adjourned below also for our evening tea, buns, and
marmalade. This finished, we spent some time at the piano
running over the tunes of the hymns for the evening service to the
third class and steerage, which we attended almost every Sunday
evening. While the people gathered and until the Rev. Mr.
Abemethy came, Mr. Over gave out some hymns, which we sang
in the dark. The lamps were then slung up, and the clergyman


began his address, after which we had more singing, and the young
English clergyman from the first class gave a sermon?a very tame
one. He seemed to miss his paper very much and to be far from
accustomed to speak ex tempore. The service was too long alto-
gether, and many of us were stiff and tired with our long seat;
I cannot say how those felt who were standing all the time.
Turned in very soon after. Run, 303 miles.
Monday, 24th Up just in time to follow the order of the bath
before breakfast, after which, began to tidy up the cabin and look
out all that I should require for the event of the day?our grand
Egyptian ball at Port Said this evening at eight o?clock. This
morning, put off woollen winter dress and on cool print for the first
time. In my blue ?tartan? check I was soon dressed for dinner
and ready for an afternoon ashore at Port Said. Before dinner
all was excitement, as we were coming in sight of the so-called
land at Port Said, but I could see very little of terra firma indeed.
? At first it seemed a little speck, and then it seemed a mist;
It moved and moved, and took at last a certain shape, I wist,?
and soon we could distinguish a few masts near the lighthouse,
and nearer still a few houses; then we saw the whole town,
which looked very well, with the English-inhabited houses to the
front facing the anchoring place. We could hardly settle to take
any dinner, which was soon over to-day, and having put all
straight in cabin, left it in charge of one of the stewards to
lock it up. Getting on deck I found nearly everybody there
before me, and on looking' over the ship?s rails a strange
sight met our eyes. The large coal barges were being tugged
along on both sides of us, and there were the Egyptian and
Turkish Arabs, or rather the ugliest of every Arab nation
under the sun, as workers on these ? coal hulks?fifteen or
twenty men on each barge. As they hauled these along they
sang a wild, weird, monotonous sort of chant until they were
close beside the ? Austral.? Then they ceased from their labour
evidently waiting further orders, but employed their spare time
most energetically calling to one and all of us for ? backsheesh,?
which is money, and it was not long when all the? hands (very
black) were at work scrambling on the top of each other searching


in the coal dust for the coppers thrown by our passengers from
the deck. It was most pitiful to see these degraded, distorted,
miserable-looking wretches in thin dark blue or rather black-blue
cotton trousers and blouses, fighting and struggling so desperately
for a penny or a halfpenny as the chance might be. Some of
them were very expert in stretching their hands high over the
heads of the others and catching the copper ere it fell, slipping it
into their sleeve or mouth, and again holding out their hands as if
they had got nothing. Very soon, however, the native captains of
these barges lost all patience with their men, for they could not get
them to go to work and stop the scrambling after the money, so
one of them, after shouting, howling, and swearing, I daresay,,
if we could have understood it, took up some handfuls of
coal and threw at the men, who went back to work pretty quickly
after this. We now bestirred ourselves to get away from the
? Austral? and out of the way of these men and the coal dust,
so Mr. and the Misses Saunders, Messrs. Dicks, Lock, and
Miss Hogg and I. soon got into a little boat, and were
paddled ashore for 3d. each, though the distance from the
ship to shore was not that of the average breadth of the
Lossie at home. On this boat the Saunders met a young guide
who had been with them on the homeward journey ten months
before, so we all agreed to take him and pay proportionally. He
took us straight to the first and most important place for all to
visit, viz., the Post Office, and there ? I posted three letters?
Father?s, with diary (21 pages), one to Miss Falconer, and one to
Miss Edgar?reserving the fourth stamp of the shilling?s worth for
a second letter to Father, but I did not get it finished in time.
At the Post Office, which was a miserable-looking building, the
Arab boys pestered the gentlemen to be allowed to black their
boots for a penny. He then took us through a sort of square
with a pretty garden and fountain in the middle. In the basin and
all round the fountain, which was not playing then, there were some
beautiful ferns and plants growing, and all this, which seemed
as if they had been there for some years, had been put in since
Mr. Saunders was there only ten months before. One beautiful
plant in this garden attracted my attention. It had a large and
bright scarlet flower, which seemed just to be one of the shoots


of the plant turned scarlet. From this we passed on to the Arab
town, to reach which we had to cross a large open flat of sand,
where once stood an Arab town before the late war. This open
space is taken up with tents and huts, in which many of the
Arabs live, the greater portion of them being either too lazy or
too poor to rebuild their houses. Passing round it he took us
to see an Arab school, in which the children were packed as closely
(seated tailor-ways) on the floor as they could sit?as many as fifty
in a small room with only the lower half of a door and no frame-
work for glass or anything else in the window. This room would
only hold ordinarily from fifteen to twenty, but there were
nearer fifty there. The schoolmaster was perched upon a raised
part of the floor in one comer, also sitting like the children d la
?mode. The tailor is an all-important man at home, but one who
would get little or nothing to do in an Arab town, judging from
the quantity of dress they wear. Cane in hand, the master sat on
his corner table with some sort of desk beside him, and as each
child came up to him with its thick, heavy-looting, black-painted
wooden slate and began to read over the Arabic characters written
on it in white, every few words he would evidently make some error,
and as surely followed a smack across the back or shoulders, each
pupil getting on an average from ten to fifteen blows. One little
fellow seemed to be prepared for it by having a thick woollen
overcoat (the others were all in cotton knickers and blouse), and it
was well he had something to protect him, for at every word he
seemed to get a smack with the cane. A few of the little ones
asked for backsheesh (money), so I threw a penny into a comer
where a child was crying, and in a few seconds there was a grand
scramble, but what was my surprise to see that the fortunate finder
of the penny had to give it up to the teacher. I tried another,
and it shared the same fate. It was strange to see with what
eagerness the blue-bloused and white-turbaned dominie stuffed the
penny into an inner breast-pocket. The place they sat in was
little better than a good calf?s stall. There was no glass in the
window, only an open square hole, and the door had only its
dower half. The children were, as a rule, intelligent, and some
even nice looking, if properly dressed and cleaned. The shops
and streets were filthy in this part. The goods were all stuck


on some rickety wooden erections in front of dark, earthen-
floored, windowless rooms, in which several persons of all ages
seemed huddled together in the most piggish filth. From this
we went round the outside of the tent part of the Arab town, and
saw some people living in straw huts not three feet high, crawling
into them like rats. We visited another Arab school, which
was more in the street, with only a sort of railing round to keep
the children all in about. We also passed two French schools,
but did not get in; they seemed to be taught by French nuns. The
hospital was near these?all looking very clean. After this we
came into town to make some purchases. I bought one or two
Xmas cards done with flowers from Jerusalem. These I posted
home for Xmas and New-Year. Where we got these was just at
the comer of the pleasure garden, and here some of our ? Austral?
friends dismounted from the donkeys. We then thought of engag-
ing them, as they seemed nice and clean looking. Their names
suggested previous riders, such as Mrs. Langtry, Mary Anderson,
and Patey?or rather that some of these persons? devoted admirers
had named the dumb animals after them. The drivers wanted
Is. fid. each, so I said ?Ohno 1? and turned my back on them; so
did the rest of the company, and we set off to buy some fruit, lemons,
<tc., for the hot weather. I bought a pretty large pomegranate,
for which I paid l�d.; but I shall not care to buy another. They
have a very peculiar taste, slightly earthy?all juicy seeds inside,
and not at all nice. I also secured a little Maltese lace, and having
completed my purchases, was ready to go on board again. When
we got to the boat it was quite dusk, and the boatmen declared it
was sixpence the ferry now, not threepence, Mr. Saunders had a
good battle, and but for him we should have had to pay them
double. It was very strange this getting on board again after our
first day ashore, for on meeting the Purser and others they
greeted us with ? Home again,? to which I added, ? Yes, and from
a, foreign shore.? We who were going to the ball had then to take
a hurried tea, put away our fruit, and dress, in which I was much
helped by Ada Saunders. She would have liked so much to have
gone, and Mr. was anxious to take her, but her parents did
not like dancing. I put on my fail-me-never brown silk bodice,
as it was the best I had out, and it was supposed not to be


a full dress affair. A more useful dress I could not have had
I shortened the sleeves, put on some deep lace, and had a white
plastron in front tied at the side with a long bow of narrow blue
ribbon, and a few forget-me-nots, all clasped with my pretty grouse
claw brooch. 1 had finished dressing nearly an hour before the
others, in fact I was beginning to feel tired before our party were
all ready to go ashore. This delay was owing to some of the
young ladies who declined at first, and then at the last minute
thought they would like to go, and so were late in starting to get
ready. I was much better off, my partner having bought a ticket
amongst the first and asked me soon after, so we were quite
independent of those -who had no ladiea*and ladies who had no
partners to take them. Just before starting for the shore one of
the officers gave us directions where the Grand Casino was where
our Egyptian ball was to be held, and told us at the same time not
to hurry as it would not commence punctually at the time fixed.
Having landed, my partner and I had a walk through the town to
the Post Office, &c., before going in. We were late for the first
dance?a set of quadrilles, but were in time for the second?a
polka. I only missed one other dance the whole evening; that
was again a set of quadrilles, when we were too late of getting up.
I had a dance with two or three of the Scotch fellows, also the
English, and one German, a resident at Port Said. I had a splendid
waltz with him?the slow, quick, walking, and backward waltz. I
had a waltz with one or two during the evening, but did not get
on so well as I could have wished, so that I began to think I
could not waltz and the fault was in myself, but after I had this
last waltz with the Fort Saider I was quite pleased, we got along
at it so easily. We had a splendid large hall, an excellent band
(half of whom were French ladies), and a great variety of people.
The larger portion of the first and second class went from the
? Austral,? then we had a very important Turkish Pasha (a six-
kfeeter), a Russian Consul (a young-like fellow), and some of the
officers from Her Majesty?s training ship ? Royal Albert.? These
were very grand-looking fellows in the royal rig, gold epaulets,
<fcc., so much so that some young Scotch and English residenters
of Port Said said it was all up with them?they need not remain
to have to beg for partners for the dances, for these royal golden


dandies would have all the ladies to themselves. Others were not
so easily put about; they remained and had a dance or two. At
one o?clock some of the elder ones got tired and left, and at half-
past one we were to have Sir Roger, but our Orientalists had no
music for this, so we finished with a polka-mazurka. Home about
two with my partner and three other Scotch fellows. Having said
good night, or rather good morning, to them as well as those who
sat up to see us come back, I turned in, but many remained on
deck the whole night, it was so close and hot below.
Tuesday, 26th. ?This morning I was up about six o?clock to
see the last of Port Said, and while on deck an important-
looking Turkish passed with a very nice-looking
young girl. I thought she was his wife, but soon it was known
that he came on board to arrest her, and that he had a telegram
from London to stop her and send her back by next boat.
A rumour of it had been heard at the ball last night, but
evidently she had to pack up this morning, as it was after break-
fast ere she and her escort were lowered and sent ashore to await
the first English vessel we met in the Canal. Many stories were
going as to the cause of this arrest. Some said she had run away
with her sweetheart, and that they had arranged he was to go on
and that she should go out after, others that she had only taken
up with a fellow since she came on board; but the general
belief is that there was some more serious charge than running
away from home, though she was under age. We heard very
little about it in our part of the ship, as she was a third
class passenger. It was most amusing to see the people this
morning in their new Prince of Wales hats of all styles, some
in white and some in pepper-and-salt brown, the latter ornamented
with the long white scarf or puggaree, with ends hanging down
the back, and many ladies in light dresses. We had not gone far
through the Canal this (Tuesday) morning?only to the end of
the first large lake?when we had to tie up to let several steamers*
pass, including the ? Surat,? a P. and 0. mail, one or two French
boats, and several English steamers?one built at Dundee, one at
London, but mostly Glasgow-built boats. While here a few
of our young men had permission to go ashore to have a bathe.
We did not know of this until after, and then we were told how


one of the young men had had a narrow escape from drowning,
and yet he was the best swimmer of the lot. It seems to have
been the weight of water that his clothes took in, for on the woollen
jersey clinging too closely to him, he lost all power to help himself.
They were all quite surprised to find it such a depth, even just
at the edge. They evidently all got a good fright, and I have no
doubt it will make them more cautious another time. We passed
into a very narrow part of the Canal after this, so narrow that it
seemed to us as if with a good jump from the ship?s side we could
have landed. It was, however, wider than it looked. There was
some beautiful creamy white grass growing along parts of the
Canal, some of which I was anxious to get, but there was none
where we tied up. We also saw several very pretty oases, with
real green grass, which was a welcome sight, for up till now we
had been passing through the most hilly and sandy country
possible, with only some scrub to soften the glare of the sand.
After the event of the arrest of the eloped one and the fortunate
rescue of Mr. Cohen at the bathing by Mr. Vivian, we
thought we had had enough adventures for the day, and that our
nerves would get a little time to quiet down, but once more
that evening we were startled, and this time much more seriously.
Darkness set in about five o?clock, and we had to tie up. We all
thought we would have to remain there for the night, and began to
talk of how to get ashore, though there was nothing to go ashore
to see but sand and scrub wood. We did not remain there, how-
ever, but made a move to the next station. At it there was
something more to be seen, for there were lights about 500 or 600
yards away. We could distinctly discern the not over comely
shapes of a herd of camels. This looked more interesting, and
many were anxious to go ashore, but there was only one boat, and
so the ladies did not go. Some of the young fellows managed to
get on terra finna, such as it was, by sliding along the thick rope
which was tying us to the shore. They were soon mounted, and
we could just see the shape of camels and riders, but could not tell
who they were, except several times when they called out to each
other that we could distinguish their voices. They sang some songs
as the camels walked along the banks, and then again high up on
the top of the hill of sand some nine or ten yards further from


the water?s edge. It was strange to see the camels how they
walked always in Indian file, with, as far as we could see, no
one leading them. There were such bursts of laughter from all on
board when the camels began to howl, or groan rather, on kneeling
down to get rid of their excited riders. We sang out to them
several times, ?The Campbells are cornin?, oho, oho,? but they
were laughing too loudly for us to be heard. A few men got
the only available boat and rowed round the ?Austral,? and
told ns afterwards they had no idea she was such an enormous'
vessel?it was quite a sail to go round her. I have since been
told that passengers and crew number over nine hundred. There
are over seven hundred passengers, and the captain, officers,
engineers, sailors, firemen, stewards, cooks, bakers, and servants
of all kinds make the number nearly a thousand all told. By
the time twenty or thirty of both second and third class had got
ashore and had a ride it was getting on for nine o?clock, and
nearly all had returned by boat or rope; but with the last boatful
there seems to have got up some squabble as to payment, and the
passengers?third class?crowding to one end of the boat,
toppled it over endways. We were on the high deck at the
time, and heard some noise get up, then the cry, ? Life buoys ! life
buoys! overboard with the life buoys!? The sailors came rushing
on deck to throw over those that were on our deck, and we ran
and gathered them together for the men. One sailor I saw tear
off his clothes and dash downstairs to dive in to the help of the
unfortunates. We young ladies were in a great state, for we did
not know who were in the boat, and were afraid it might be ?our
boys,? as Mr. Saunders calls the young men who are generally in
our company. For a few minutes all was uncertainty and anxiety ;
then came the news that there was no fear, next that all was
right, and at last the young men themselves appeared. They
also had a struggle as well as the third class passengers in the
upturned boat, but with them it was hands skinned and peeled by
the rope from the ship. This would not have happened if some
mischievous scamp or scamps had not greased the rope, so that
when the fellows tried to return to the ship they slipped down the
rope again. The poor sailors did get a heat lowering the boat, &c.,
they did it so quickly. By and by all got settled down when it


was known that all was well It was beautiful moonlight, and
many were very unwilling to go below to turn in after such an
eventful day, but we were all very happy to say, like the
watchman on the lookout, that ? All?s well? Bun, only 30 to 40
miles in Canal.
Wednesday, 26th. ?This morning about breakfast time we got
up as far as Ismalia, where the great French engineer, M. De
Lesseps, and a party of French gentlemen came on board the
? Austral? Ismalia is a hundred yards or so back from the Canal.
We could see the palace and some pretty houses nicely sheltered
under the green trees, but all around seemed dry, hot sand,
and brown, burnt scrub. After this we passed into narrow parts of
the Canal, then again into the lakes, in which we had not long to
tie up because M. De Lesseps was on board with us and we were
allowed the preference to pass on first. M. De Lesseps and suite
were shown all over the ? Austral? by the Captain in the after-
noon, and in the evening we got to Suez just at twilight. The
approach is much like that at Fort Said?first-some large houses
apparently standing out of the water. We were greeted with much
cheering by the crew of a steamer waiting our arrival, and which
was arrayed in one mass of flags. Several of the houses were
also decorated in honour of M. De Lesseps. He remained to
dinner on board, and afterwards a steam tender came and
took him and his company ashore. There were several steamers
at Suez when we arrived, and it was a beautiful sight by moon-
light to see the high rocky mountains to the south of Suez
and the lights of the steamers on the water. Many were anxious
to go ashore by the Arab boats which were round us in the
shortest of time. One boatful did go for Is. each, but had to pay
sweetly to get back again, some giving 205., others from 40s. to
50s. Run, 30 to 40 miles.
Thursday, 27th. ?Everybody up in time to be ready to go
ashore at Suez. Miss Hogg and I would have liked very much to
go, but all the parties had been arranged, and as we heard it
was some five or six miles by sea, then three miles? donkey ride
ere we could reach the town, we gave up the idea of going, and
made up our minds that we should put off our visit to Suez until
we returned. It was dreadfully hot, and so we did nothing but


lounge about until dinner. When our friends came home again?
for so we spoke in the morning, that we should remain at home in
the ?Austral??they had no very bright accounts of their day
ashore, and were very glad to get on board again. Their difficulty
had been with the donkey drivers at the landing place, where they
were so hemmed in by these men that they had nearly to fight
their way out, and even one of the passengers had his hand on his
pistol to take it out to frighten them. When the cowardly Arabs
saw the end of the pistol it was enough for them?they scuttled
out of the way as quickly as they could. These Arab donkey
drivers seemed to have followed our friends most determinedly
so that they should have some revenge on them on the return
journey in the evening, but luckily one of the party had a friend
at Suez, and he saw them safe started back for the ? Austral.?
Others by sailing right up to Suez got on much better, enjoying
the sight of a really ancient Oriental town, but which for Arab
filth and misery is ten times worse than Port Said. Many seemed
delighted with the three shilling dinner they had at the English
Hotel. Pun, about 40 miles.
Friday, 28th ?Sailing along through Gulf of Suez the whole
day. A very high, mountainous, rocky, and sandy-looking coast in
the distance. A place was pointed out to us where the Israelites
crossed, and on the eastern side we could see distinctly the fresh
green palm trees where Moses? well is still shown. There was
much discussion amongst us if these were the real places or not.
To all appearance it seemed a very likely crossing place, though
the water is very wide. It is, however, not in the Red Sea
proper, but in the Gulf of Suez, the north-western branch of the
Red Sea. We passed into the Red Sea proper about nine o?clock,
and are now beginning to feel the heat. To-day we have a very
sad affair to record. A young clergyman in bad health threw
himself out at one of the port-holes, and the rash act is attributed
to temporary insanity. The first cry got up on the lower deck.
We rushed to the side thinking there was a shark in sight, but very
soon we knew that a man was overboard?some said an engineer,
others a fireman, or one of the sailors. Before we were aware of
what had happened we saw a patent life buoy with a flag waving
above it and a light burning alongside of it. In a minute all hands


were at work lowering a boat, and the engines were reversed and full
steam put on backward. One of the officers ran and got out on the
top of the awning at the stem, and everybody stretched out as far
and as high as they could to see if there was any sigh of the man.
Soon several of us on the upper deck saw a black speck about
twenty yards from the life buoy. The steamer was quickly back at
the place where the life buoy was, and was guided almost to the
exact spot where the man must have gone over. The boat was
quickly lowered and steered straight for the black speck, and from
the ease with which the crew lifted the man into the boat it was
supposed he was still in life; but our hopes were soon destroyed,
for though breathing when found, he was quite dead when brought
on deck. All three doctors on board gave him up, but the Captain
said ?Do not give up; try again.? This happened just after
dinner, and in all did not occupy twenty minutes; and when
known definitely that it was the young clergyman in delicate health
in the second class, we knew at once it was poor Mr. Thomson,
and that in his weak state the plunge into the water was enough
to kill him. In a little time the truth came out that he had
jumped out at one of the port-holes, and from his weak state of
health he is supposed to have done it in a state of temporary
insanity, for he was in his usual health in the forenoon, and the
day before bought shells, &c., at Suez for presents to take to
Sydney. It was very sad and sudden, for at dinner time he was
alive, and he was buried at tea time. I was down below at the
time and looked out at a port-hole. Did not hear the service,
but saw the body slip off the board and fall face forward into
the water. I wish I had not looked; I shall never forget it.
Having no idea what it was like, I was much moved at the sight.
Spent the evening very quietly talking about the sad event.
Run, 296 miles..
Saturday, 29th. ?Beautiful morning, but rather hot. Still in
the Red Sea, and no land in sight. Busy this morning again
getting out more clothes, for this is our second baggage day in the
three weeks. Spent the afternoon knitting, reading, and talking.
When coming up on deck after tea, I met Mr. Weir, and stopped
talking with him and listening to some of the third class passengers
singing on the lower deck, one of them playing the accompaniment


on a small harmonium. Mr. Weir was just saying I should not
have much to enter in my log to-day, when one of the officers
darted downstairs past us, and immediately after, the cry was
again raised of ?Man overboard !? This time it was worse than
the former case, as it was evening and very dark. Shortly after
the cry was raised, we heard that some one had jumped in to try
and save the first man. There was a dreadful scene on deck,
because we were still ignorant of who the men were, and the rate
at which we were going gave little chance of recovering either of
them, unless they were good swimmers. Immediately on the cry
being raised, one of the patent lighted life buoys was thrown into the
water, and three boats were lowered to the rescue in the shortest of
notice. The steamer was also stopped by this time and backed to
the spot where the life buoy floated. The darkness prevented
us seeing where the boats were though we saw the light of the
buoy, so we were kept long in suspense as to what good the
sailors were able to do. They remained searching I think
fully three-quarters of an hour. One boat?s crew found the
first class passenger who had so madly jumped to- the rescue.
It was all he could do to reach the life buoy and save himself. A
great fuss was made by some about Mr. Hopkins going to the
rescue, but to many of us it seemed absurd to think of saving
the first poor fellow, considering the rate at which we were going
and the darkness, no one having any idea as to the spot where he
went overboard. Mr. Hopkins was picked up near the life
buoy, and I daresay a little less inclined to try the same thing
again. By the time the steamer had made a complete circuit of
the place, another steamer came up and spoke to us to see what was
the matter, and then passed on, as it was not anything in which
we required extra aid. The boats soon returned, and great praise
is due to the sailors for the rapidity with which everything was
done, for it seemed to us that the order was hardly given when the
boats were unfastened, lowered, and off. When it was known who
the first man overboard was there was not so much reason for regret,
as,the poor fellow?s mind was a little gone, and he could hardly
have lived many weeks longer, he was so weak and wasted from
consumption. His loss, however, caused a very sad and melancholy
feeling .among all on board, and several of us could hardly help


beginning to imagine that the ?Austral? was an ill-fated or
unlucky ship. The evening was very dark, cloudy, and hot;
lightning was flashing every few minutes in the west. After supper,
had much talking over the sad event of the evening, and after-
wards, before turning in, sang a few Scotch songs to some of the
Scotch fellows, and we were joined by one or two others. Later
on, we sat and talked on the high deck in the dusky twilight.
Run, 316 miles.
Sunday, 30th. ?Still very hot, so glad to keep on light print
dress, it is so nice and cool. Before breakfast, had a walk
on deck, and found Mr. Weir and Mr. M?Phun trying the
hammock of the latter. I had a rock in it, and again until church
time, when I went to service (English Church) on the first class
deck, but being too far back we could not hear the Captain read.
The address by the young English clergyman was a little better
than the last. After dinner, which consisted principally of fruit,
we had a long quiet read, and then one of ? our boys,? as Mr. and
Mrs. Saunders call them, said that now was the time for an
afternoon cup of tea. As soon as we knew that some other friends
were of the same mind, Ada Saunders and I set off to make it
ready and bring it on deck. We got Mrs. Saunders? teapot, as it
is a pretty large one; the rest of the necessaries I had at hand.
Large as the teapot is, we had to re-fill it two or three times, so
many were found wishing a cup. One Mrs. Burton, who has
five or six children with her, was very pleased to have some.
There was some singing on the fore deck in the afternoon, but I
was too warm after tea to go, this being one of our first very hot
days. Went to evening service held by the Rev. Mr. Abernethy
in front of the second saloon smoking-room on the one side and the
hospital on the other, with first and second class deck on either
side above. Many stood or sat and listened up there instead of
coming down on the main deck. Had a better address this
Sunday, and some good singing. Run, 308 miles.
Monday, Ist December. ?Rose to breakfast, but not feeling up
to much. Tried over ?Rothesay Bay? with Mr. Curran, who is
to play the accompaniment for me this evening at our first
concert. I went on deck afterwards, but was not able to do
anything, and about twelve, was forced to go below and keep


my bunk until nearly two o?clock, when I managed to crawl out
and have some dinner. I kept on deck all the afternoon, and
having had tea I felt much better in the evening. Ran over
my song once more, as I was very nervous about it, and
having been so sick all day, felt rather weak and shaky.
Wandered about until it was nearly concert time, then dressed
and went in. The saloon was pretty full, so was glad my song
was fourth on the list. This left me breathing time ere I com-
menced, and then I was out of purgatory and free to enjoy
listening to the others. The following is the programme of this
the first concert on board the ?Austral?* on her first trip back
after going down in Sydney Harbour (Mr. Gibbon, Purser, in
the chair) :
1. Piano Solo, ? The Queen of Roses,? Mr. T. Gallibrs.
2. Song ?Home they brought her,? Mr. Jbitery.
3. Recitation,.. ? King John and Abbot of Canterbury,? Mr. Clarke.
4. Song, ?Rothesay Bay,? Miss Watson.
5. Recitation ? The Execution of Montrose,? ..Mr. Suoden.
6. Song, ?The Tar?s Farewell,? .'..Mr. Gibbon.
Interval of Five Minutes.
7. Violin Obligato, Herr Dcchnitz.
8. Song, ?The Midshipmite,? Mr. Stanley.
A TY .X? A * _ tirl iL A \ t J ???� J J?? ? - ?M aIIiIh MM Mm H V \
9. Recitation ?The Maid wid dem nothings on,? Dr. Forster.
10. Song, ?Oh, haste ye back,? Miss Galliers.
11. Recitation, ?The Little Hero,? Mr. Vivian.
.Mr. Vivian.
12. Song ?The Choristers,? Mr. Codmorb.
For the first, it was on the whole a very good concert, especially
the violin obligato by the young German, and the recitation by
the ship?s Doctor excited great fun. Mr. Stanley?s song, ? The
Midshipmite,? also went very well, the audience joining in the
chorus, ?With a long, long pull and a strong, strong pull.?
The second class passengers have the gratification of taking
the lead in thus giving the first entertainment of the voyage, and
not the first class, of whom there were a good many amongst the
audience to-night. Was glad to change my dress after supper, it
was so warm, and put on my dark dressing gown to go on deck
for a breath of fresh air before turning in. Run, 317 miles.
Tuesday, 2nd. ?Not feeling up to much this morning, as we
are going along at a good rate to get in as soon as possible to


parp. 31
Aden. Before arriving there at dinner time we passed along a
very rocky coast, one group of rocky, mountainous-looking islands
being known as the ? Twelve Apostles.? There had been a wreck
on one of these not very long ago. Those who were going ashore
hurriedly took some dinner and went off. Miss Hogg and I fully
intended going, but it was so hot and both of us having been sick
that morning we could not think of exerting ourselves, so remained
at home. Bought some limes and a few bananas from the natives
who came alongside and climbed up the ropes and on to the ship
everywhere. The natives at Aden are a much better looking
race than those at Port Said or Suez. It was most amusing
to watch the little boys of ten or twelve in little cork canoes
not much bigger than themselves, and with a short oar just
like a cricket bat. I saw one very little baby-looking fellow of
seven or eight (he could not have been much more), lose his oar,
but he sat and paddled his boat with his hands and arms until he
got it again. Then the water having got into his nut-shell, he
quickly slung his legs over the side and baled it out with his
hands, when he again drew his legs into the canoe and paddled away
after one of the passenger boats. It was quite a sight to watch
him. From the passengers he would likely earn some coppers
like the rest for diving, as these Adenites are most celebrated for
their aquatic performances. It has been said they will dive down
one side of a large ship and come up at the other, but I did not
see them try that with the ? Austral.? Immediately after this
the port-holes were all closed and the coaling commenced, but with
less ado than at Fort Said. We escaped the coal dust at the
latter place, and were therefore quite unprepared for the dreadful
dusty rubbish, which went flying everywhere and made such
a mess in a few minutes. While the others were away at
Aden, Mrs Galliers, Miss Galliers, Ada Saunders and I washed,
dried, and put away the glasses in our saloon to help the poor slavey
stewards, who have some five dozen tumblers used every day.
When the silver was brought in from the pantry we counted it
out also for them, and arranged the forks, table spoons, and dessert
spoons separately. There were twelve dozen of each, but some
of them had been washed and used a second time, as there is not
sufficient for the passengers (nearly two hundred) in the second


saloon. During the afternoon I repaired my dress which I tore
on the door of the Purser?s cabin the day I received the four letters
at Suez. I was so delighted to get them I bounded off in such a
hurry that my old tartan dress was torn nearly all in ribbons.
Soon our friends began to return from their third visit ashore since
we left our native land. The evening was then spent on deck
hearing the several adventures they had had ashore. Many brought
back beautiful white ostrich feathers in bunches of threes and fours,
and compared each other?s bargains in price and quality. One
young fellow had bought four for 7s. 6d.; another had given 15s.
for almost the same, but the latter was bought on board ship,
where the Arabs have less opposition than on shore, and can
therefore demand and hold to their price from those who do not
or cannot go ashore. There was much less variety of stuff being
sold at Aden?principally limes, dates, cocoa nuts, bananas,
figs, oranges (very dear), star fish (hard and shell-looking),
white coral in piece and red coral jewellery, and some very peculiar
shaped work-baskets made of stained straw. As I did not go
ashore at Aden myself I can only relate shortly what one of the
passengers told me of how the party he joined from the ? Austral?
spent the day at this ancient place. Four of them left the ship
about two o?clock, just after dinner, by boat rowed all the way to
Aden, there being scarcely a breath of wind blowing. The distance
was about three miles to the landing place, for which the charge
was Is. each. In this they found a change for the better in the
order of things from Port Said and Suez in the form of an Arab
policeman, who noted the arrival of every boat and its men (each
being numbered), and this public functionary was not found ? off
his beat and far, far away? when wanted, but saw that the proper
fare was charged and given on both sides. There was the usual
array of donkeys, donkey carriages, and their drivers. Our friends
chose the carriages, and were driven up the mountain zig-zag,
through a pass, down the other side, and through Aden proper,
then up-hill again on the farther side of the town to see the famous
water tanks of Aden. This drive was very up-hill work until the
summit of the pass was reached. The roads were very rough and
rocky. On this road, as on several others, they passed through
many iron gates on the way, and at each gate one or two sentries


were stationed, their only duty, however, seeming to be to close
the gates at eight o?clock, or earlier if it was dark. After
passing the highest gate the descent to Aden (ville) is no 'more
zig-zag, but nearly straight. The town of Aden is rather a poor
looking place, but not quite so bad as Port Said and Suez for
laziness and dirtiness. The houses also are rather more habitable
than the corresponding Arab huts of the two Canal ports. Port
Aden was still more advanced in having some better shops than
the town. There the principal purchases were made, I believe, of
the ostrich feathers and cigars at all prices and of all qualities.
From Aden (ville) to the great water tanks is only a little further
on, but up-hill again, and there, cut out of great rocks and with
steps down, are these immense tanks, six in all, the largest made
to contain 5,000,000 gallons of water and two others nearly the
same quantity. These tanks were all dry, however, at this time,
but there are wells near the tanks, and at these the Arabs draw
water at Is. a bucket, which is paid to the sentry, one being
always on guard there. Round the top outside edge of the
tanks there is an iron railing, and trees are growing all round, so
that the entrance down to the tanks is only by the iron gate
at the top of the steps. In the bottom of one tank one of the
young fellows found a small snake about five or six inches long and
about the thickness of a very fine worm, and clear and silvery-
looking. On the return drive they came through the town again,
but after that changed the route and bore more towards the
sea through a long and rocky tunnel lit up with lamps and
guarded by sentries at the gates at either end, which were also
closed at dusk. On coming out of the first tunnel there is the
fortifications of Aden near the shore. From this they drove along
a very barren and rocky shore to a second smaller tunnel, at the
end of which the English barracks are built. After passing through
the third tunnel they arrived at Port Aden, where they had
started from, and here they met the native Arab cavalry and
also the English brass band, and behind them, as a body guard, a
detachment of mounted Arab police. They were just returning
from seeing Lord Dufferin on board the P. and O. s.s. ? Tasmania,?
after his visit to them at the barracks and fortifications as he was
en route tor India. When we arrived off Port Aden we saw four


English men-of-war and one French vessel lying at anchor, and all
decorated and the sailors were standing on the yard-arms in
honour of the visit of the Governor-General of India. A general
salute was fired when he sailed from Aden. We ought to have
sailed that night also, but the Arabs were so slow putting in
the coal. It was only here that we endured the miseries of
coaling. At Port Said the coal was sent in at open shoots in
the sides of the vessel, but here it was sent in from the main
deck, so that it was ooal, coal everywhere and not a clean
place anywhere. But to return to Aden, one thing that surprised
our visitors was the number of people travelling to and from Aden
and its port?almost a constant stream of them, walking, riding on
donkeys, or in donkey carriages. After having a look round Port
Aden, boat was again taken for the ?Austral,? the charge being
the same?ls. For the drive over the heights to the tanks and
back the charge was about 35., all charges being very moderate
considering the heat. Our night at Aden was one of most beautiful
moonlight, and the phosphorus glistened exceedingly bright round
the ship. Sailed early next morning. Run up to Aden, 302 miles.
Wednesday, 3rd. ?A very hot day, as we are now in the Gulf
of Aden, and will soon be passing land off Cape Guardufui, on the
African coast, which will be the last sight of terra firma on this
side the equator for a good few years for many of us. The next
will be that of our adopted country, but that not until fully a
fortnight hence, and then it will be Cape Leeuwin, off which is
said to be the Bay of Biscay of Australia. Read a little this
morning and joined in rehearsal for the ? Trial of Pickwick v.
Bardell," in which I am to take the part of Mrs. Saunders, ? who
had also received love letters like other ladies.? Almost too hot
to do anything to-day; not much of a breeze. Something wrong
with machinery again, so run is small?94 miles.
Thursday, 4th. ?Still in the Gulf of Aden. Heavy sea on and
wind dead against us, so that many were not up to breakfast, at
which I was surprised seeing the vacant places; but I had not long
to wonder, for I soon began to know the reason why, being forced
myself to turn in ere the day was well begun. I lay a while in
the saloon, then on deck for a little. Felt a little better in the
evening, and had a walk along to the fore deck. Waited up on


deck to see the presentation to the sailors who had so gallantly
gone to the rescue of those in the capsized boat in the Canal. We
could not get in to hear the speakers, there being so many there,
but we got a look in at one of the port-holes. It was in the
smoking-room, as there was some recitation or reading entertain-
ment going on in our saloon. Was forced to turn in very soon
after this, and Miss Hogg also. The doctor looked in on us both,
but he might have saved himself the trouble, for he could neither
advise one thing or another; he seemed as much ?at sea? as if we
were consulting the wrong man. It was still hot, so I took the
velvet cushion of the settee, put it on the floor of the cabin, and my
two large pillows on the step of the cabin door, and laying my
head there I had a very comfortable bed. I heard afterwards that
the two men who jumped overboard got two guineas each and
the five of the boat?s crew one each. It was not much after all
when divided, but if it had not been for one or two in the second
saloon many would not have thought of it. Run, 290 miles.
Friday, sth. ?Do not feel much better to-day, but got dressed
with a struggle while others were in at dinner. I had then some
beef tea from the Stewardess, and went up to the companion-way
and sat there some time. Heard the fun going on over a tug-of-war
between the second and third class, but did not feel equal to the
exertion of turning round my head to look out at the entrance to
see it. The third class won as there are so many strong fellows
among them. Was forced to turn in again, and was sick for the
fourth or fifth time to-day. This has been the worst day I have
had. Run, 282 miles.
Saturday, 6th. ?Slept again on cabin floor and rested pretty
well, but felt very weak indeed in the morning. Lay in the saloon
until dinner time, when I went to my cabin and dressed. Got on
deck after that for a little until the first lot had finished dinner.
I then went down and had some. I met several just coming out
from dinner, and they were laughing and teasing me at my first
appearance for three or four days, but was also complimented on my
endeavour to master the mod, de tner by eating something at last.
Went on deck immediately afterwards as it was cooler there, and
feeling very tired, had a nice long rest until three o?clock, when I
thought I felt steady enough to go along to the first class deck to


see the sports. The heat was very great, especially from the
machine-rooms below. Though the first class deck is broad and
open, I much prefer our own, as it is cooler and free from the
noise of the machinery and the smells from the galleys, machine-
rooms, (fee. It is now so long ago since I saw the games on the
Market Green at home that I can scarcely remember them, so I
was much interested in those on board ship. The first was an
obstacle race, in which three took part, Lee (of our saloon) coming
in first, I think. In this race they had to pass under first one
pole firmly fixed just the height from the ground to allow them to
crawl through, then another a little further on; ahead of that
were three windsail ventilators tied to a horizontal pole, which
was three or four feet from the ground. The racers had to spring
into and crawl through these long canvas chimneys, then swing
themselves over a rope four to five feet high, run along to the far
end of the deck, pick up a potato, pocket it, over the rope again,
and back to the starting point. It was good fun at the rope.
When the last one on his outward run was still struggling to get
over, the first two came back on their homeward run, and there
the fight was for who was to get over first. At last one on the
return journey got over and gained the race. This was followed
by the potato race, the potatoes being split in halves and placed at
about a yard apart and in a straight line. Each competitor had to
run and pick up the first or the last in the row (it being quite
optional where a start was made), and return each time with a
half and deposit it in a bucket lying at the starting point. Some
began at the nearest end of the line, others at the far end,
and those latter, having the longest run over first, were generally
the winners in the race. Following this was a race ten times
round the deck, and as it was a dreadfully hot afternoon it must
have been most trying, especially to those who had gone in for the
former races. The next game of ? cock-fighting? was not quite so
heating. The competitors sat on the deck with their hands warped
together with a glass-cloth folded corner-ways, then with their tied
hands they embraced their knees, and when in this threefold
position a roller was passed over the right arm at the elbow, under
both knees, and over the left arm. Remaining bandaged up like
this, they fought with their toes, or rather their feet, to knock


each other over, the one who remained on terra forma longest
without rolling helplessly over gaining the day, the game terminating
when the one who first falls over three times is the loser. This
game was principally by those of the first class. ? Pulling the
badger? followed, which is holding a roller firmly between two
persons seated on the ground, and, feet to feet, trying to pull each
other over. This is known by some other name in Scotland, but
though one of the Scotch fellows told me, I cannot remember it.
It was not so amusing, however, as the others, but was followed
by a still stranger game called the egg and spoon race. Instead
of eggs, which are a great specialty (fresh) on board ship, they
used potatoes, and as soon as one let fall the potato the race was
lost to him. Next on the programme was the hopping race the
whole length of the first class deck, being quite as long as any of
them cared to keep up; and lastly, but not least in interest, to
bring the whole to a grand finale, there was a tug-of-war between
the first and second class. It was tried three times. The second
pulled their opponents over twice and were declared the winners,
but they had a pretty hard tug for it. Of the nine prizes the
second gained seven. A bell was then rung to meet for the presen-
tation of prizes, and in that, as in fact during the whole day, the
Captain was most amusing. Mr. Fast got a rub from him on
receiving the egg and spoon prize. The Captain said he hoped he
should never want some one to spoon with. Thus the afternoon
was brought to a most agreeable close, and an invitation given to
a dance in the evening on the first deck from eight till ten, the
music to be given by the sailors. Ere we had congratulated all
our prize-winners and found ourselves in our own quarters it was
tea time. Several had already commenced, and it was quite
amusing to listen to the buzz of voices talking so eagerly over
the events of the afternoon. Tea being over, we all adjourned to
our usual corner on the larboard side of the mast on our high deck
? To sit and chitter-chatter
(Not) over a cup of scaldiug water,?
for we had just had that, but of the sports and those who went in
for them, <kc., and to rest until we should hear the music on the
first deck, when we should then adjourn to see the fun and perhaps
join. Having waited for a little and being some time past the


appointed hour (eight o?clock), we went along to see if there was
really any dancing. We found all busy on the light fantastic toe
to very good music by one of the sailors on a musical instrument
which could not hare cost pence, far less pounds, the rest of the
band having been dismissed, or rather having had a breakdown, not
being A 1 at Lloyd?s, as the Captain told my partner (? a Highland
lad?) for my first dance of the evening, which was a Highland
schottische of course. This was towards the end of the dancing,
for up to this I had only looked on; but when our national
schottische was started my partner and I, being of the same kith
and kin, could not but join in it. As it was ten o?clock by this
time and the sailors had now to go on watch, we finished up with
? Sir Roger,? and so I had just the three last dances. The Doctor
told me as I passed him that he thought it was a great credit to
him to see me so well after nearly a week on the sick list; but
the ? Austral ? was my best doctor when she went ? rolling, rolling
over the bounding main? and abstained from pitching and tossing.
Then I was ?all right.? Run, 291 miles.
Sunday, 7th. ?tip in good time; had a bath, and feeling very
well indeed. At church on second saloon deck. Some of the
gentlemen were very restless during service, which was by Rev.
Mr. Abemethy. Read a little and spent the remainder of the
afternoon making tea on deck. Read again and wrote a little
until six, when I had some tea below, after which I kept on deck
until service on the third class deck, when we moved forward and
looked over and joined in the singing, but were too tired to go
down to stand during the whole service. Had a biscuit for supper,
and on deck again for a talk until time to turn in. Miss Hogg
still very sick at times and losing strength every day. Run, 312
miles.
Monday, Bth.- ?Tidied up my cabin a little, and slept a while
during the forenoon. Not feeling able to do anything, and so glad
I was not to sing at the concert to-night, the programme of which is
given below. The song of the evening was that of ? Sunshine and
Rain.? In response to a loud encore, Mr. Chichester gave us
? Thinking of Thee,? which was equally well rendered and heartily
applauded. The next most enjoyable items on the programme were
the two violin obligatos, the first by Captain Charlton, who received


a hearty encore, and the other by Herr Duchnitz, also ?well given.
? Annie Laurie? was a perfect farce, being given by an English
fellow who evidently knew little of time or tune and not even the
words of the song. The Doctor?s recitation was very good, and he
gave us for an encore his recitation at the previous concert, ?The
Maid wid dem nothings on,? or the story of ? The Mermaid of the
Rhine? told in broken English. This our second concert was a
great success and a decided improvement on the first. Enjoyed
our sea-board biscuits to-night at supper, and after a short turn on
deck went below to turn in, but ? Annie Laurie? and the singing
of it had so upset the nerves of some of our young men that they
grot quite excited -towards the ? wee short ?oor ayont the twal?,?
and not feeling sleepy enough to turn in themselves, kept a few of
us below rather longer'wide awake than we cared for. A few of
them would not have been so communicative to one another as
they stood at the foot of the companion-way or at the entrance to
the saloon had they known that their next door neighbours were
not yet in the land of dreams. Run, 340 miles.

Tuesday , Sth. ?Felt very sickly and not in a mood for anything
in the forenoon, so did not care to turn out. Was better in the
evening, and went on deck after supper and sung a few Scotch and
other songs with some of our young Scotchmen, and were joined
by one or two others. The song that seemed to be the favourite


with us all was ?When ye gang awa?, Jamie.? Weather getting
cooler. Run, 369 miles.
Wednesday, 10th. ?Heavy sea on; still getting cooler. In
bed the greater part of the day, so not able to go to the concert
given by first class, after which the larrikins became very musical
and gave us the benefit of a midnight serenade, which we should
have preferred had they postponed until a more convenient season.
Run, 338 miles.
Thursday, 11th. ?Still very sick this morning, and cabin being
warm and close, slept in saloon again with a good few other ladies
until five o?clock, when we were wakened by the stewards ere they
commenced floor-scrubbing operations. I then retired to my
cabin and slept on a long cushion on the floor until breakfast,
arrowroot being the only thing I could take. Miss Hogg also
very ill, but she has much less quiet from the people in her cabin,
so that she has neither rest, peace, nor comfort. It is plainly
evident that she cannot and must not remain any longer there, so
have resolved to take the advice of one of the young gentlemen
and ask the Doctor if she may go into hospital to sleep, and I
with her. Find that the hospital is not ready, so we are to sleep
on our deck in the two hammocks hung side by side from the
wooden framework over which the awning is spread. Shall go
into hospital to-morrow, for Miss Hogg is very weak and is not
eating anything. Run, 290 miles.
Friday, 12th. ?Slept very well in the hammock. A good
breeze blowing, so that I felt it chill about four o?clock when I
got up and ran downstairs to my bunk for a cover, as my flannel
dressing-gown did not keep me quite warm enough. Slept soundly
until the sailors came to wash down the deck, when they were very
much surprised to find us two young ladies in the hammocks.
One of them wanted to know if we should like the hose turned on
us for a shower bath, but I said ? No, thank you. All we wish is
to be left alone if we are not in the way.? Being told we were
not, we settled to sleep again, and were very soon unconscious of
the scrubbing and splashing of water on the deck under us. We
remained so until after eight, when all were at breakfast. We
then got up and dressed. Had a good laugh last night about
Lee, who, dressing himself with false beard and moustache, was


brought by Mr. Wood to Miss Hogg and I and introduced to us
as the man in charge that night by the Captain?s orders to see that
the deck was cleared at eleven and everybody below. He would
also see that everything was kept quiet and peaceable for us, so
that we should not be disturbed or annoyed in the least. I thanked
this supposed ?man in charge for the night,? thinking all the
time that I had never seen him on board ship before. Three
minutes after, was told it was Lee just for a joke. He had told
several others the same story, and that they were all to go below
at eleven by the Captain?s orders, which seemed to have some
effect, for I never knew the deck to be so soon cleared and so
quiet before. Run,? 286 miles?very poor, as the wind is right
ahead, and the whole of the decks being covered with awnings is
against us.
Saturday, 13th. ?Our first night in hospital, where we slept
very well. It is a large and roomy cabin with four berths. There
is always plenty of fresh air, it being just at the foot of the stair
to our high deck and the first door at the top of back stair down
into our saloon, and therefore very convenient and near for us
when we wish to go either up for fresh air or down for something
to eat. The Stewardess, however, and several of our friends have
been most kind and attentive in bringing us anything we could
take. We had several visitors to-day, which helped to make time
pass more pleasantly. Feeling rather better to-night, but not able
to do much. Would have liked very well to have gone to fancy
dress ball on first class deck, but could not be bothered dressing,
I felt so tired. Managed to get on deck after all had gone
to the ball, and had a long conversation instead of a dance.
Went along to the first class deck to see the dancers in their
different ? rigs,? and it was a most interesting sight. The deck
was covered over with the ship?s flags and lit up with coloured
Chinese lanterns. We were just too late to see the Captain
dressed up as a lady, and a very good one he made, I believe;
and many of the others were equally well got up. The Purser,
as a gentleman of the time of Prince Charlie, had a large white
tuscan hat turned up at the side and trimmed with a few white
ostrich feathers, black coat, the collar trimmed with pale pink
flowered sateen, deep white lace on cuffs of coat, and the same to


finish off tight knee-breeches. Pink silk stockings and buckled
shoes completed his costume, as far as I can remember. Lee, from
.our saloon, was dressed as a sailor, and he had his ? lass? with him,
but ?she? happened to be one of his young gentlemen chums dressed
up as a darkie girl. ?Her? dress was rather short, and an after
view showed ? she? had not been able to borrow a pair of stockings,
but was wearing instead ? her? own socks. They were a very
affectionate-looking couple, for they took up with no one else
there, and seemed quite happy in each other?s company the whole
evening. The ship?s Doctor was very good as a nigger, with a
doll?s gilt hat stuck on the top of his head, which was made
?as black as black could be.? Mr. and Mrs. Frost from our
saloon looked very well indeed. Mr. Frost was all in white, with
a variety of biscuits arranged and sewn tastefully all over his
dress, the sea biscuits on his shoulder looking exceedingly well as
epaulettes. Mr. Fast, also from second saloon, did not make
a good gentleman of the time of Prince Charlie, being too much of
the beardless boy. Amongst the first class there were a good few
as Arabs, and these looked very well. Two young ladies as
students in gown and cap were particularly noticeable. Had I
been well enough I should have, gone as a Scotch girl, in muslin
dress, with tartan sash, Tam o? Shanter cap, and real white and
purple heather in cap and dress. I saw only one young lady with
our national colours, and very little of them even then. A set
of quadrilles was being danced during the few minutes I stood to
see them, and all looked remarkably well, the only drawback being
that the music could only be heard by about half the dancers. At
a little past eleven, I think, the ball finished up to the entire
satisfaction and pleasure of all, as far as I have heard. Run, 293
miles.
Sunday, Hth. ?Still liking hospital very well, as we are
excellent company to each other, and neither of us had very
agreeable cabin companions, Miss Hogg in particular being most
unfortunate in hers. The ship is still pitching and tossing a good
deal, so that we are living not on love altogether, but arrowroot
to breakfast and arrowroot to supper, and as best we can at dinner
time. Spent the forenoon partly with Miss Hogg and partly on
deck, as I did not feel well enough to go to church in our saloon,


at which the Rev. Mr. Abernethy preached, or to service on the
first class deck, at which the Captain gave a short address on the
purpose they had in view in getting up a ?Grand Fancie Faire?
or bazaar on the first class deck on the afternoon of Wednesday the
17th. I believe it is for the training ship ?Dreadnought.? If
a good sum will be realized, then part will be given to some
Sailors? Home or other marine institution of that kind. Had a
short sleep after dinner and felt rather better. Read a while at
? Thomas Wingfield.? Being very thirsty, I wanted to make an
afternoon cup of tea, but could get none of the young ladies to join
me in it, so did not bother?we were all too lazy, I am afraid.
We spent a very weary and lonely Sunday, both of us remaining
sickly in hospital the greater part of the day. Had a few
visits from kind enquiring friends during the day and evening,
some of whom were not feeling very well, especially those who, like
myself, miss the happy, happy days gone by and Sundays at home
in particular. Heard a short address at the old place between the
two high decks by the Rev. Mr. Abernethy, and afterwards by a
gentleman from the first saloon, who related his experience of
leaving home for Australia, life there, his great anxiety and
excitement when, on his returning home, they were nearing the
old country, and still more his eagerness when in the train and
walking up the road back to the old home once more to meet his
aged father. He was not a clergyman, and his way of speaking
was rather hard and matter-of-fact, but towards the end it was
very gentle and touching. Lizzie and I sat at the hospital door
and heard all, and we were quite near enough to join in the singing.
After church we had a talk with Mr. Hogg and friends, then said
good-night, and went below and turned in for the night. Run,
296 miles.
Monday, 15th. ?Not feeling much better yet. Rehearsal on
for the Pickwick affair, but I was forced to give up my part, as I
was suffering too often from sea sickness to be depended on to
appear in it when it comes off. Spent the afternoon doing some
Australian wild flower cards to sell at the bazaar. I was asked
to be one of the stallholders, but as we found we could hardly
hope to get up so large a bazaar as to have two stalls for the second
saloon, we resolved to make one good stall. The elderly ladies


are to remain at the stall and the younger ones are to help them
in any way or go about and buy or sell. The third concert in
our saloon came off to-night, and as it was rather a long one, there
was no interval. Though more inclined to lie still in hospital
with Lizzie, I got up, dressed, and went, as it was the last. The
following is the programme (Mr. Gibbon, Purser, in the chair): ?
iMre. Brunton, Miss
Fielding, and Herr
DtJCHNITZ.
2. Song ?Some Day,? Mrs. Myers.
3. Song, ? Rock to Rook,? Mr. Higgs.
4 - Duet ? The Eed Cross Banner,?... j *%*?�����*
5. Recitation ? The Stowaway,? Mr. Vivian.
6. Song, ? Topay?s Song,? Mrs. Stanley.
7. Song, ? The Maids of Lea,? Mr. Curran.
8. Violin, Selections from ?Patience,? Captain Charlton.
9. Song ?The Bend of the River,? Miss Galliers.
10. Song, ?The Bellringer,? Mr. Gibbon.
11. Solo (Piano) ? Lucretia Borgia,? Miss Eve.
12. Song, ? I seek for Thee in every Flower,? ...Mr. Chichester.
13. Recitation, Dr. Forster.
14. Song, "Yeavea-ho, yo-ho,? Mr. Stanley.
It was a very good concert indeed, the songs of the evening being
given by Mr. Chichester. The first one, ? The Red Cross Banner,?
with Miss Ada Saunders, went exceedingly well, but the second,
? I seek for Thee,? received a still more hearty and well-deserved
encore, which, much to the disappointment of the audience, did
not bring us another song. ? Rock to Rock? was sung with great
gusto by Mr. Higgs, many of us agreeing with the writer of the
song that if we were once on terra Jirma we should only be too
happy to remain at home. Getting a loud encore, Mr. Higgs
sung it again, and so strongly that, as the Captain told him, he
put the two centre electric lights out, but they came to life again
when he had finished singing. Had supper and a talk in saloon,
and then retired to hospital for a short talk before turning in.
Run, 297 miles.
Tuesday , 16th. ?Spent the forenoon painting some text cards
for the bazaar, and the afternoon in finishing wild flower cards
and getting dress ready for the event. After tea, dressed and


went to dramatic entertainment given by first class in their saloon.
This was the first time I had been in it since the visit with Father
on the Saturday before we sailed. To-night I had a seat at the
table nearest the entrance on the starboard side. Did not hear
very well, being too near the door and the noise of the waves
through the open port-holes. The play went very well, the ship?s
flags as curtains reminding us, however, that we were not having
an ?at home? entertainment, but were still at sea. All returned
to their own quarters well pleased with the evening?s enjoyment
after the true and plain outspoken sayings in ?A Rough
Diamond,? but a little disappointed that the Doctor had forgotten
the last few words of the conclusion. Run, 293 miles.
Wednesday, 17th. ?Much going on to-day in preparation for
the ?Grand Fancie Faire? to be held on the first class deck at
3 p.m. I spent the forenoon finishing the painted text cards, and
after dinner, got dressed. I put on my Tam o? Shanter and had
real white and pink heather for buttonhole and bouquet. A gentle-
men from the first class had a weighing machine (most likely out
of the store), and with this he professed to give everybody their
true weight in pounds and ounces, and with the aid of a sailor
band of big drum, <fec., managed to beat a good many sixpences
out of the passengers? pockets. When they got hold of one or two
of the most corpulent of the gentlemen there was a special drum-
beating. Next to this was a stall got up particularly for the fairy
fortune-teller (Miss Ada Saunders), who looked exceedingly well
in the costume of a Normandy maiden, and had quite a crowded
stall. At sixpence each (afterwards threepence), she drew a pretty
large sum of money. The refreshment stall, where everything, from
iced champagne to ginger ale, was sold at Is. a glass, I believe,
paid also very well, and the tea and bun stall on the other side of
the deck was equally well patronised. There were a good few
cigars, photographs of different groups of Captain, Officers,
Passengers, and Stewards, die., on view for orders, and white
handkerchiefs, collars, and cuffs were in request by not a
few. A spendid new hammock from one of the second class
passengers was raffled for 30s. in all, and for a photograph of the
Captain in plush frame fifteen tickets at Is. each were sold.
Many would have liked it, the Captain is so popular, but Mr.


Saphir was tlie fortunate winner of the prize. There were plenty
of buyers, though it was feared at first that this would be the
only drawback to the success of our ? Fancie Faire.? I bought
a few odds and ends, took a walk about, and then returned to
Miss Hogg in hospital, which she has scarcely ever left, and has not
been able to go to any of the entertainments for some time now.
After tea, had a walk until about eight o?clock, when the concert
to be given by a few in the third class and to be held in our
saloon was to commence. There was quite a crowd, many of the
first saloon being present, who afterwards said, as well as every-
body else, that it was the best concert that we have had yet.
The programme was a little long and the Doctor?s recitation
occupied some time, but the concert was not tiring like most
concerts. The glees were particularly well sung, but I did not
hear the last three songs, as Mr. Hogg came and told me that
Miss Hogg and I would have to leave the hospital almost at once
to let a sailor in. I went to gather our things together to take
below to our cabins again. Miss Hogg went to mine, as her cabin
companions had not improved?rather the reverse?since they
had got the cabin to themselves. Run, 301 miles.
Thursday, 18th. ?Slept last night in the saloon beside Miss
Fielding, and in the morning in the Stewardess?s cabin. I felt
very tired this morning, and after breakfast of porridge in bed,
fell fast asleep. When I awoke it was nearly eleven o?clock, and
I was afraid to get up and go along the alleys and through the
saloon at that time of the day in- my dressing-gown with
unwashed face and uncombed hair. Being also afraid I might
meet the Captain on his rounds, I called to one of the Stewards,
?Has the Captain been his rounds yeti? As fate would have
it, there was the Captain just passing the cabin door, and he
asked ? Who is thatl What do you wish 1? Then the Chief
Officer, Mr. Northcote, came to the cabin door to see what I
wanted, and following him was Mr. Cunningham, the Chief
Steward, and his assistant, Allwright. It was so dark in the
Stewardess?s cabin that I could not be seen, and they were not sure
from which cabin the voice came. Allwright, who is always in
our saloon, knew my voice when I answered I wished nothing. I
was very much taken aback at being heard by the Captain calling


out to know where he was. Once I knew he was past, I got up,
and under shelter of Miss Saunders (Emma) beat a safe retreat
along the alley, across the saloon, and into my own cabin to
Miss Hogg, there to dress to go on deck before dinner. Neither
Miss Hogg nor I were feeling very well, but after being on
deck for some time we were able to take a little dinner, and in
the afternoon accepted an invitation to a Scotch tea party.
Walked on deck afterwards, and then went below and dressed
for the dramatic entertainment given by the first class in their
saloon. The first piece was called ? Done on Both Sides,? and
this was followed by the farce, ? Cut off - with a Shilling,? which was
played by Mr. and Mrs. Stanley, from second saloon, and the ship?s
Doctor. Both pieces were very well done, but especially the
latter, the players in which showed some acquaintance with actors?
ways and stage style. Having the two pieces kept us rather late,
and on coming out there was great fun and consternation when it
was found that supper was all over and the bar closed, and much
conjecturing took place as to whether we should get any biscuit,
bread, butter, and cheese to-night. We were not kept very long
in suspense, an order having come from the Chief Steward granting
us leave to have supper after all. Weather still bitterly cold, as
we are getting near Cape Leeuwin. Having put all my wraps
down last baggage day when the weather was warm, I am much
indebted to one of our young gentlemen for a rug to kept me from
freezing altogether. Run, 247 miles. Ship stopped once again ;
something wrong with the machinery?wants cleaning or re-
pairing ; don?t know what. Meantime we are drifting towards
the north-east.
Friday, 19th. ?Started again this morning about two a.m.
The start woke many passengers, but I was too comfortable in my
old bunk to be roused. Miss Hogg occupied the upper berth in the
Stewardess?s cabin last night. Spent most of the forenoon on deck
writing up my diary, and slept all the afternoon. lam getting
dreadfully idle; have no will to do sewing of any kind. Have a
pretty good appetite, and believe I shall be much better of the
voyage after I get ashore. After tea, tidied up to go to hear the
? Pickwick Trial ? come off". Heard the first of it and saw the
dresses, which was all I wished, as I had heard the earlier


rehearsals so often at the time it was intended that I should take
a part. Went on deck then for about an hour, and came back
just in time to have a talk and say good-night before turning in.
Run from two A.M., 112 miles.
Saturday, 20th. ?Was wakened this morning about eight by
shouts of ? Ship in sight 1? This is the first one we have spoken
to since leaving Aden. We passed three, but they were so far
away that we could only tell whether they were ships or steamers
by the little cloud of smoke always in the wake of the latter.
This morning, however, it was the Orient liner ? Lusitania,? or as
some of her old passengers who are with us term her, the ? Dear
Lucy.? I was too tired and sleepy to get up to see her, thinking
she might be some distance off, but in this I was mistaken, for I
heard the loud cheering as the two sister ships passed each other,
both reporting ?All well,? the ?Lusitania? being four days out
from Adelaide. One thing struck me as curious, and I could not
help taking notice of it. When an Orient liner passes an Orient
liner there is shouting and cheering, but when a P. and O. liner
passes an Orient it is dead silence, though Britons on each. We
had again some cheering at eleven o?clock to-day when north
of Cape Leeuwin, where we had our first glimpse of Australian
land, our second home and country yet to be, and the question
naturally rises in the minds of several I know?? Shall we ever
leave it to return to dearest friends left behind?? We can but
? trust in God and do the right,? and ? waiting patiently upon
Him, He will withhold no good thing from them that love Him,?
or, as one of the few good, true, and honourable young men
amongst us, as far as I can judge, has put it?
? Could I my future read, 0 Lord,
My faith I?d never prove;
So let me rather learn to trust
And wait upon Thy love.
?Then when life?s journey all is o?er
And I?ve my lesson learn?d,
Far better than a gift to me
Shall be the joys I?ve earn?d.?
Our first view of the fair and sunny land of Australia was very
faint?just a low line of pale blue hills; but on getting nearer


parts seemed very rocky and others very sandy, with brush, scrub,
or wood beyond. Two hours? sail along the coast brought us to
Cape Leeuwin, which we rounded at one o?clock, and we are now
sailing along the south coast towards Albany. At Cape Leeuwin,
the Bay of Biscay of Australia, we had the most beautiful weather
of almost the whole voyage?blue sky, blue sea, and
? The fair breeze blew,
The white foam flew,
The furrow followed free.?
The coast along to Albany is very picturesque, with some pretty
sandy bays and beaches enclosed by high, wild, and dark rocks.
Two large rugged rocks standing out some distance from the shore
added much to the beauty of the coast line. It was dark ere we
passed through St. George?s Sound, so we did not see Albany,
where the P. and O. steamers call to leave passengers, &c., for
Western Australia. The second and last game of cricket came off
this afternoon on the first class deck, those of the first saloon
gaining again. Spent the evening very quietly on deck rolled up
in shawls and covered with rugs, as there was such a cold wind
blowing off the land. Miss Hogg is much better to-day, and had
to stand a good deal of teasing about the sight of land rousing her
drooping spirits. Run, 297 miles.
Sunday, 21st. ?The Stewardess called this morning to see if I
wished any breakfast, and as I did, I asked her to bring it to me,
thinking I was late. I found it was not so late, however, so I got
up and dressed immediately and went into the saloon, where I
enjoyed a good dish of the national breakfast?porridge. I then
went on deck with Miss Hogg until the bell rang for church?
Presbyterian service in our saloon and Episcopalian on the first
class deck. Had a rather better sermon from the Rev. Mr. Aber-
nethy this morning, which is likely the last many of us will hear
from him. Went on deck afterwards, and saw, also for the last
time, the muster of the ship?s crew before the ? Skipper,? Chief
Officer, and Purser. There were sailors, stewards, firemen, cooks,
bakers, ifec.?in all, nearly 150, I should think. There are 75
stewards alone. Was able to enjoy dinner to-day. The following
is a fair sample of the usual Sunday bill of fare:?Brown soup,


roast duck, roast beef, boiled mutton, followed by fruit pudding,
blanc mange and strawberry jam, Scotch shortbread, figs, dates,
raisins, nuts, &c. Miss Hogg is still keeping better, and was able
to go in to dinner to-day for the first time for fully three weeks,
I think. Lay in my chair all the afternoon on deck opposite
Lizzie (Miss Hogg), both of us wrapped up in rugs and with a
pillow at our feet. Had tea and a talk afterwards, then went to
? kirk? at the hatchway, and sat at the top of the back stair from
our saloon. Rev. Mr. Abernethy gave us a pretty good address
this evening, being specially adapted for our last Sunday on board
ship, but the singing was poor. Retired on deck then for a talk ;
four of us had also our sea biscuit supper there as a special favour
on this our last Sunday together, and we brought the evening to a
close with a long, serious discussion, which I think I shall not soon
forget. Run, 294 miles.
Monday, 22ml. ?After breakfast, gave notes from my diary to
one young gentleman to make up his one, which he had neglected.
At ten o?clock I was called to sit again for our group, and was
very glad we got into pretty much the same position as at the first
sitting, which was that all the Scotch and some other particular
friends were near each other to the right hand side of the group.
It was bitterly cold on deck, so we were glad to get it soon over
and out of the wind and rain down into the warm saloon until
dinner, after which I had a short constitutional. I then went down-
stairs and finished giving notes from my diary. One note the
young gentleman added to his at Aden was ?Steered clear of the
girls,? which amused me very much, and was evidently meant for
some of the young austere parties whose absence was their best
company. Walked again with Lizzie until tea, and that over, set
to writing out eight or nine copies of the programme for the
duffers?, larrikins?, or radicals? concert which came off this evening.
The opening selection by Miss Fielding was most enjoyable,
especially the part from the ? Cloches du Monastere,? and the
songs ? Far, far away,? ? Ten thousand miles away,? ? Friar of
Orders Grey,? and the Irish ones, went very well indeed. Some
of the other songs, as ?The Stirrup Cup? and ?Rock to Rock,?
were exceedingly poor, and it must have been a general relief to
all when they were finished. The following was the programme


of the concert:?
Piano Solo Miss Fielding.
Song, ?Far, far away,? Mr. Chichester.
T> _ A.i 1 1 A : f) lf_ IT
Recitation, ?American Eloquence,? Mr. Vivian.
Song ? Milking her old dun Cow,? Mr. O?Driscoll.

Song ?Rock to Rock,? Mr. Higgs.
Song, ?Going to do without ?em,? Mr. Vivian.

Song ? Father O?Flynn, ?? Mr. Curran.
Song, ?Soap, Starch, and Candles,? Mr. Lee.
Song ? Here?s to the Maiden of bashful fifteen,? Mr. Chichester.
Finale, ?God save the Queen,? By the Company.
Lizzie and I had a walk on deck afterwards for a short time. We
then turned in, but I not to sleep, for some of the singers were
still wandering about, and general excitement seemed to prevail
amongst them since we were getting so near our first landing place
on Australian soil, where a good few will remain, and in all pro-
bability we shall leave behind one or two who have been very good
and kind friends to us during the whole voyage. Should we be
spared to ever meet again it will be a great pleasure. We can
but trust that we may all see each other again, but who can tell
where, when, and how ? Run, 294 miles.
Tuesday, 23rd. ?Still in better health, and Lizzie also.
Though the vessel is rolling very much to-day we do not feel it.
The under currents and the strong head winds are the worst for
sending us below, but these are all over now, I hope. Took a
short walk with Lizzie after breakfast and met M?Dugald, the
chief engineer, and Mr. Cunningham, the chief steward. They
even felt the cold yesterday, for it was exactly like a wet,
drizzly November day in Scotland. This morning I did a little
patching up of some music, and after dinner wrote up my diary.
Lizzie and I have an invitation to tea on deck at four o?clock, so
shall have a walk until that time, and finish my diary after the
Christy Minstrel concert which they are talking of getting up
to-night. The fire bell alarm has just sounded (three P.M.), and
the stewards, &c., have taken to their heels to whatever part of


the vessel the supposed fire has been discovered at. This is now the
third time the alarm has been rung, a notice being always put up
beforehand so that the passengers may not be frightened. The
Christy Minstrel concert did not come off after all, and it was
better, as many are busy writing letters to post at Adelaide
to-morrow for home. Miss Hogg, Mr. Blankley, Mr. Hogg, and I
were busy writing until supper, after which we went on deck for
a last talk together, and were soon joined by Mr. Wood and Mr.
M?Phun. By the time the lights were out below we had started
singing, but as the gentlemen were going in for a ? refresh,? we
finished up by singing ?Auld Langsyne? hand in hand throughout
the whole song. Lizzie and I then said good-night and left them,
not without regret that it was the last time to those who are to
leave the ship for altogether on the morrow. Run, 293 miles.
Wednesday, 34th, ?Breakfast over, and our friends having
finished packing up below, we all came on deck to watch the
taking up of the luggage to be ready to land as soon as Adelaide
was reached. At half-past eleven the anchor was dropped, and a
steam tender came alongside with the health and custom-house
officers, the former being met by our ship?s Doctor, who presented
a clean bill of health. The mails were then landed, in all, forty-
six bags for Adelaide and Western Australia. Then the visitors
from the shore came on board immediately, and by and by our
passengers began to set off to visit Adelaide ; but those who were
not going to return again to the ?Austral? remained behind to
see their baggage safely off first. By one o?clock the tender with
our friends had gone and we had waved our last farewells with
heartfelt wishes for their health, happiness, and success in the new
country. We continued waving until we could not distinguish a
person on board the tender. So many good-byes being said with
those we should so much like to be with but may never meet
again, reminded me much of the partings at Tilbury and Plymouth,
and I began to get quite home-sick. Dinner was almost over ere
we went below, but we were in time for the best part of it?
fresh fruit from Adelaide, the finest of which was cherries brought
on board immediately after the anchor was dropped. It was
frightfully warm on board ship to-day, and the coal dust was flying
about. Almost everybody being ashore, Lizzie and I, feeling tired


Ipiarjj. 53
and lonely, lay down in the saloon to have a sleep, but it was
too hot, and we had to get up and go into the intermediate alley.
After tea, we wrote letters and had a walk on deck until Mr.
Hogg and the other Scotch fellows returned from Adelaide. They
brought us some splendid fruit?cherries, plums, apricots, and
peaches. Those who had been ashore at Adelaide returned with
glowing accounts of the nice dinners they had got ?roast lamb and
mint sauce, new potatoes, plum pudding, and plenty of fruit.
Several of them had not had time to get tea ashore and arrived
on board too late for it with us, so as they were very tired with
the heat ashore, Lizzie and I made tea about nine o?clock, and we
had quite a large Scotch tea party. Thus we spent Xmas eve on
board the ? Austral ? hearing the different accounts of the first
day ashore on Australian soil. There was a good deal of noise
and rowdyism on board until past twelve, then all became quiet.
I slept in the saloon as it was so hot in the cabin, but did not
get a long rest, the stewards being early astir to commence the
Xmas decorations. Run, 300 miles.
Thursday , 25th. ?Xmas day, and on getting up I joined in the
fun. Miss Fielding also came soon, and we were hard at work for
about an hour and a half. I then dressed for breakfast and made
buttonhole bouquets for the ten table stewards in our saloon, that
they also should look dressed for Xmas day at sea. While
waiting for Miss Hogg to get ready to go in to breakfast together,
I helped one of the stewards to decorate the Chief Engineer?s and
Chief Steward?s cabins while the latter was below at breakfast.
Spent the forenoon on the fore deck sitting in the sun getting
? done brown,? and wrote my diary until dinner time, when Mr.
and Miss Hogg and I took our old places at the dinner table for
the last time on board the ?Austral.? We had a very good
Xmas dinner?roast turkey, roast lamb, mint sauce and green
peas, plum pudding, cherry and currant tart, pastry, Scotch short-
bread, apples, apricots, currants, raisins, nuts, &c. Went on deck
again for the afternoon, and continued writing up my diary. It
was very hot, and having short sleeves, got my arms properly
browned. I rather liked it until they began to smart and burn
pretty sharply. The vessel was rolling fearfully all day, but we
enjoyed it as it does not affect one in the least like the pitching


and tossing would. During the afternoon one of the engineers
took Mr. Hogg, Lizzie, and I through the machine-room and the
refrigerator to see if it was any more Xmas-like down there
amongst the freezing beef and mutton, ifec. The stairs and alleys
down to these lower regions are very narrow, and the further
down the cooler ; but on coming up again we felt it hotter and
hotter until the top of the stair right over the machinery was
reached, and there we could scarcely bear it. I did not expect to
find a refrigerator just like a low, damp cellar full of frozen piles
of meat of all kinds, and the walls covered with a thick coating of
frozen water. We returned after this to our own quarters and
had tea; then went on deck to see the dancing, in which I took
part with
? But what his name,
Or where his hame.
I dinna care tae tell. ?
The ship was rolling so much that there were two or three pauses
in each dance, but that only made it the more enjoyable and
greater fun. Miss Hogg and I then went to join a small Scotch
evening party, which passed off very pleasantly, each one singing
a song in turn, and with best wishes to all friends ? far awa? in
bonnie Scotland,? we finished by singing ? Auld Langsyne? ere
? elder?s hours? had rung. I prepared to sleep in the saloon near
Miss Fielding and some others, it being so warm in the cabin ;
but I had not lain long when I heard the strains of ?Auld
Langsyne? on deck, and could rest no longer below. Wrapped
up in dressing gown, &c., I ran up the back saloon stair and joined
in the last verse. Then went below for the night. Run, 300
miles.
Friday, 26th. ?I felt rather sick for a little this morning as
we rounded The Heads at Queen?s Cliff, the entrance to Melbourne
Harbour. Once past this, all was well, and I commenced packing
up in preparation for a few days ashore in this fair city of the
sunny South. While sitting at table just going to commence
dinner, exactly at one o?clock, the anchor was dropped, and the
steam tenders with friends from the shore were soon alongside us,
so that many could not rest to finish dinner, but ran away ere they
had well commenced. One woman, on turning round while at dinner


and looking out at the port-hole behind her, recognised some one
on the first tender and shouted ? George.? Immediately several
of the young ? larrikins? in our saloon took up the call of ? George?
also ; and until she left the ? Austral? she was known and named
? George? by all. Hurriedly finishing dinner, I went on deck
with Mr. and Miss Hogg to look out for any friends who might
come to seek us out. I did not expect anyone would call for me
until later on towards evening. The excitement was great on deck,
everybody straining their eyes amongst the crowd of visitors for
new friends. Many good-byes were said, and I then went below to
finish some letters to take or send ashore to post that afternoon, as
the ?John Elder? was to sail at six o?clock. When just finishing
this I was agreeably surprised and delighted to hear some one
calling that there was a lady looking for me, and soon Miss Grant
and I were making all arrangements for leaving the ?Austral?
while she lay in Port Melbourne. We took a hurried look over
our big ship, and found that Miss Hogg?s friends had also come on
board, so that we had still the pleasure of going ashore together as
we came on board together at Gravesend. There was a dreadful
crowd at the gangway, and as all were trying to get ashore sooner
than their neighbours and taking as much luggage with them as
possible, it was a slow process getting into the tender, which was
pitching at a great rate owing to a pretty strong gale that was
blowing. I was no sooner in this hobby-horse tender than I began
to feel queer. Getting safely on to the landing pier, however, we
hurried along the platform to the train, but found it already well
packed with ?Australs? and their friends, so we had to wait for
the next train. It was only then that we got time to feel strange
on terra firma and wonder why we could not walk comfortably
along, finding the land further from our feet or nearer than we cal-
culated. On the second train coming up, Mr. Mackenzie and his
brother, who are young Scotchmen now in Melbourne, and who
came down to meet Mr. and Miss Hogg, got us a nice carriage,
and Miss Grant and I made up the party of six. We had hardly
got seated and begun to feel strange at being surrounded by land
when we were joined by Mr., Mrs., and Miss Galliers, Mr. Lock,
Mr. and Mrs. Lockie, and friends. Miss Grant and I parted from
all at Hobart Town Station, where I said good-bye to many friends,


yet hoping to meet again, which we did many times. In almost
every street in Melbourne we met some ?sweet familiar faces,?
and many a good-bye was again repeated. After a most enjoyable
tea with Miss Grant, our home friends, Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins
from Richmond, came in to see Miss Grant and I. We were
disappointed to hear that Mrs. Jenkins had missed Miss Grant in
the morning before starting for the ? Austral? Nothing daunted,
however, she followed Miss Grant down to Williamstown and
enquired for the whereabouts of the ship, but after wandering
about she could get no information, and was forced to return to
Melbourne and on to Richmond, quite tired out with the heat and
dust. After a short talk, Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, Miss Grant, and
I walked out to the comer of Flinders Street and took ?bus to
Richmond. I could see very little of Melbourne then as it was
about nine o?clock and dark, but by the gas lamp light I could tell
there were many nice villas and gardens along the road. Passing
an open'space of waste land or common, I noticed the trunks and
bare branches of some very large old trees. I remarked that these
were nice old beech trees, but was soon told they were only some
old dry gums. T noticed also the name of one of the houses we
passed, and I daresay you also at home will have heard Leigh House
mentioned before. After having some talk again of the people and
places at home, and supper, we had to hurry off to catch the last
train into Melbourne again?not half-an-hour?s run. I enjoyed my
first day ashore in the new country very much, but was glad to
turn in for the night to a very comfortable bed, which seemed
to be very much too big after my cabin quarters. Yet I must
say I like my cabin very well, and shall feel sorry to leave the
ship, and glad at the same time to get to the end of the voyage.
Saturday, 27th. ?From all appearances one would have thought
that I had got very salt and seasoned to the sea when on the first
whole day I was to have ashore I must hurry off immediately
after breakfast to the ? Austral.? In the excitement of getting
ashore yesterday afternoon I forgot to ask for any letters from
Sydney, and also to leave my Melbourne address in case anyone
should go on board looking for me. I also wished to get up some of
my Sydney luggage, but soon found that impossible as there was
such immense quantities of luggage and cargo to land at


Melbourne. On going down this morning to Williamstown by
train from Spencer Street, Melbourne, I found the ? Austral ? had
not come up to the quay to the place which the ?John Elder? had
vacated the evening before. After wandering about, like Mrs.
Jenkins, and straining my eyes in every direction at all the ships
and steamers lying out in the bay, I gave up all chance of finding
out the vessel or her whereabouts, and was just going to try
a boatman to take me out when I found one of our second class
passengers in the same plight as myself, so we got a man to take
us out to the ? Austral? in a cockle-shell of a boat. The breeze was
so strong the boatman could only put up the sails the least bit,
and I felt very thankful, after a good deal of pitching and tossing
by the side of the ? Austral,? to make one great jump, and find
myself safe on the gangway, and then on deck again. Several on
board teased me for coming back so soon. There were no letters
for me, only I was in time for dinner, and having taken from my
cabin the things I wanted, I prepared to start by the first large
boat for the shore. In this we had a nice steady sail, with only a
few passengers, one a handsome, sunburnt young officer from
some of the other Orient boats, and who had been visiting one
of the ? Austral? officers. I was sorry I had missed seeing
W. Mitchell, who had sailed out to the ?Austral? on Friday
after I left and given one of the stewards a note for me, saying
he would call again on Saturday morning, but he had been
there before me, and left no town address. However, I after-
wards met him by chance in Mr. Ellis?s office. When I returned
to Miss Grant from my trip to the ?Austral,? Mr. and Miss
Hogg had been there to see me, and were to return, which they
did in a short time. They were going to South Yarra to spend
the Sunday with some friends, so we said good-bye until the first
of the week. Soon after tea, Miss Jenkins and her brother came
for me to go with them to see the Exhibition Buildings, to which
we went by ?bus. These buildings are very large, and are some-
thing like the Crystal Palace, London, but wanting in the beauty
of style and artistic arrangement of fountains and artificial ponds
within and without. One part of the Exhibition was exceedingly
quaint and interesting. This was a sort of short street or court in
London long ago when there were no numbers to the houses, only


signs such as ? The Crown,? ? The King?s Head," ? The Queen?s
Head,? ? The Golden Fleece,? &c., and the people in these little
old-fashioned shops were dressed up as nearly approaching the
time of the existence of the buildings as their different tastes could
imagine or devise. A Punch and Judy show had just finished in
this ? old curiosity? suburb of the Exhibition when we reached it.
We did not stay long there, as a concert was to be given in the
music hall of the building. At it we heard some good singing,
but the hall being so large we could not catch the words of the
songs?at least I could not, not being acquainted with the
Australian pronunciation. Miss Grant was to follow us, but
though we kept a good look out we did not see her, so concluded
she had not got away. The beautiful tree ferns with their thick,
brown, foggy-looking trunks and the fronds growing right out at
the top were very cool and pleasant to sit under at the far end
of the hall. We left the Exhibition grounds about ten o?clock and
walked into town, it was such a beautiful moonlight evening.
We enjoyed the walk very much, and, on the way, we passed
through the flower, fruit, vegetable, and poultry market.
Sunday, 28th. ?I so thoroughly appreciated my ? bunk? ashore
with Miss Grant that I slept until it was too late to go to church
in the morning, Miss Grant having been up and breakfasted some
hours before me. I intended writing home before dinner, but
trusting I had plenty time, put it off, and then some friends
came in to see Miss Grant. One of them was a young Scotch
lady, but where her tastes had been acquired would be hard to tell.
She did not eat meat, could not take any milk pudding or milk in
any form, not even in her tea, and to crown all, took salt to tea
instead of sugar. If she had had to rough it for a term or two in
an English boarding school she would know what a relief it was
to have plenty of excellent food for the asking or taking, and it
would soon have cured her of such whims. Having gone to speed
the parting guests, we turned with much pleasure to welcome the
coming?Mr. Jenkins, Miss Jenkins, and her brother, who came
for us to go altogether to see the ?Austral? that afternoon. We
took train to Sandridge, or Peart Melbourne, as it is now called,
not half-an-hour?s run, if I remember rightly, and there we got a
boat entirely to ourselves, with the exception of one young couple,


who were very careful for each other?s welfare. There was a good
breeze blowing, so we had a splendid sail, having to go in a sort of
zig-zag way for the wind, and this made the sail nearly three times
the straight distance. Our boat was high out of the water at one
side and almost touching it at the other, but I never enjoyed a sail
so much in my life. On getting alongside our ship I had to halloo
to Mr. Northcote, the chief officer, if I might bring my friends
on board, as the orders below at the foot of the gangway were to
allow only passengers on after four, and we had no idea it was so
late?we found it past five when we got on board. After taking
a quick look over the ship we were just in time for a cup of tea,
which we enjoyed very much after our sail Though it was only
ship?s tea, ship?s bread, butter, buns, and marmalade, it tasted
better in port than at sea, where the fishes often had the benefit
of it. While in the saloon I had a note by post from Mr. Clark,
Junee, saying he had been appointed there, so that he could not
see me in Melbourne as he expected, and asking me to take on
the parcel for him to Sydney, or send it any way most convenient
fc to myself. (I took it on and sent it by rail from Sydney.) Soon
after tea came the order for all going ashore for the night to start
immediately as the tender was going. It was much calmer now,
so we got back to Sandridge much more slowly and more
direct, reaching Melbourne just in time to go straight on to
church. Being Scotch Presbyterian myself, and having only one
chance of Sunday in Melbourne, I wished to go to the Scotch
Church, and was glad I did, as there was some very good singing
and a much better sermon than I have heard for the last six
weeks. The text was Genesis xxviii. 20-22?? If God be with me,
and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread
to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father?s
house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God,? &c. It was
rather hot in church though there was not a full congregation. In
walking home we enjoyed the cool of the evening all the more
after the heat, and were quite ready for tea when we got to Miss
Grant?s after our wanderings.
Monday, 29th. ?Had a very good night?s rest, though wakeful
from having such a comfortable, roomy bed. After a very enjoy-
able breakfast, the tea and bread and butter tasting extra good


after our sea fare in that line, I was ready for another round of
the great city of the sunny South. I commenced this morning by
looking up some other friends whose addresses I have?Mr. Ellis,
Melbourne, and Mr. W. Mitchell, whom I met at the office of the
former. Mr. Ellis gave me directions how to go on the following
day to see Mrs. and Miss Ellis. I then went to William Street to
find Mr. G. Kay, and as it was nearly mid-day, he finished up so
far for the morning and came out to see me safe back on my way
to Miss Grant. We went along some of the principal streets, and
thus had a walk and a talk at the same time, the latter of course
of friends in dear Morayland. I spent the afternoon with Miss
Hogg, went out for a walk through the principal streets to have
a look at the shops and the people, or doing ? the bloeck,? as they
call this here in colonial slang. We had also a look through the
firm of George <fe George, one of the William Whiteley kind of
shops, and then returned to Miss Grant?s to tea. Mr. Hogg then
called for his sister, and we said good-bye until I was to meet
them at the station ere they started inland for Castlemaine. I
forgot to say that on Saturday afternoon Miss Jenkins took me for
a walk through the Botanic Gardens, first along the Yarra which
looks rather duller in complexion than the sister river at home.
The Gardens were exceedingly pretty, especially the fernery, in
which every leaf was glistening with the water newly poured over
them. Outside this grotto it was so hot, and the mosquitoes
were so hungry (they seemed to know me as a new-comer), that
we were glad to get away. We walked smartly over the hill,
passed the palm houses, which were closed then, and out at
another gate, when we took ?bus back to the city. These
omnibuses seem very strange to new-comers, having only a driver,
who, through a hole in the roof, watches every one who comes
in, and with little change box and bell, he receives all the
fares and gives any change wanted, thus saving the expense of
a collector inside the ?bus. Ere Miss Hogg left on Monday
evening we had tea and strawberries, the latter quite delicious
in such warm weather. In the evening Miss Jenkins came
at Miss Grant?s request, and Miss G. chaperoned us both to the
theatre to see ? Confusion.? It was an exceedingly pretty little
theatre, built very much in the Continental style, with a wide


ftarg. 61
promenade just within the entrance, but whidh does not seem to be
used by the audience between the acts for a short walk, as they do
in Europe. That is accounted for, I think, by the plays here not
being so long and tiring to sit out as in Germany. I enjoyed
the play immensely; it is well named, being really confusion
doubly confused. The evening was beautiful when we came out,
so that the walk home to Flinders Street was very pleasant after
the ?warmth? of our next neighbour in the theatre, who was
rather corpulent to be such a close companion in a crowded house.
Tuesday, 30th. ?Sorry I have to confess to laziness again in
getting up this morning, so that it was rather late in the forenoon
ere 1 started for Richmond to see Mrs. and Miss Ellis. I took
train to Richmond, and following the directions given by Mr.
Ellis, soon found the house, which is on the Kew side and not
far from the station. Had a long talk first with Mrs. Ellis and
afterwards with Polly, both of whom I like very much, they were
so kind to me in every way. I only regret I had not longer to
stay with them, as I had to hurry back to Melbourne to meet Mr.
and Miss Hogg at Spencer Street Station to bid them good-bye ere
they started for Castlemaine. I left Richmond soon after lunch.
I saw when I reached Burnley, the next station to Richmond, that
it was almost impossible to get back to Melbourne in time, so I
called in for Miss Jenkins at Burnley, and we came on together
to Flinders Street. I was angry with myself at not being back in
time to meet Mr. and Miss Hogg, but glad I had said good-bye on
Monday, though I made sure of seeing them again. I hope I may
meet them some day, but ? it may be after long years, and it may
be never.? Miss Grant, Miss Jenkins, and I were just finishing
tea, with cherries and strawberries, when Mr. Fraser, a young
friend of Miss Grant?s, came in to go down to see the ? Austral,?
and then Mr. G. Kay came in to say good-bye and see us safe into
the train. When we reached Port Melbourne (Sandridge) Station
I saw the Captain waiting to go up to Melbourne, so I asked if it
was too late to take friends on board, it being then nearly eight
o?clock. He told me it was not, and as there seemed to be
nobody else going we had to take a boat to ourselves, the boatman
telling us when we were half way to the ? Austral ? that he had
just taken the Captain ashore, and that we were not likely to sail


until the next night. Miss Grant was very kind in wishing me to
go back and have another day ashore, but as I had taken every-
thing with me and it was so uncertain when we should sail, I
thought it was better to remain on board than run the risk of
being left behind. Mr. Fraser having had a hurried look over
our ?floating hotel,? Mias Grant and he had to go, as the boat
was ready to start for the shore, and it would likely be the last
for the night. I had then to say good-bye to Miss Grant,
regretting much that I could not have stayed longer, and been
more with her and less running about town. I hope, however,
that at no very distant date we may yet have an opportunity of
spending a few days together. She said she would find out when
we were to sail and come again to see me if she could, so with
that we said good-bye. It was a beautiful moonlight night, and
by going down the gangway I could see them for some distance
after they left the ship?s side. Retiring to my cabin, I tidied up a
little and divided a bouquet of roses amongst one or two friends
who are still on the ? Austral? and had not been ashore at
Melbourne. Said good-night, and turned in.
Wednesday, 31st. ?Spent the day making up my diary, and
being rather lonely, wandered all over the ship once or twice,
?our party? being quite broken up now. I was two or three
times on the qui vive to go ashore again. I had even got a Gibbs,
Bright, & Co.?s pass from their pilot boat, and was dressed, letters
in hand, and at the gangway when some one advised me not to go
as I should not have time to go up to Melbourne and come back
by the pilot boat on its last trip for the night. There was very
little coming or going of passengers during the day, but every one
of the empty berths in our quarters were taken by passengers
from Melbourne to Sydney. I had looked once or twice for Miss
Grant, though not really thinking she would come so far again.
However, about eight o?clock I heard some one calling me as
wanted, and I was both surprised and delighted to see Miss Grant.
She was again accompanied by Mr. Fraser, who was to remain
this time as a passenger for the trip round to Sydney. He had
intended going back to Sydney a few days later than the
? Austral,? but when he had seen her the evening before, when
they came on board with me, he changed his mind and came


back to-night with the last passenger boat. A great many came
on board to-night, but those not going on to Sydney were very
soon called off by the old dismal cry, ? All friends ashore,? and
I said good-bye to Miss Grant once more. It was quite dark
when the tender left us, so that all were soon lost to sight. As
this was New Year?s Eve, several of us Scotch and English, and in
fact nearly everybody, made up their minds to sit up until twelve to
see the auld year out and the new year in, with a farewell to the
former and a welcome for the latter, with all its joys and sorrows,
pains and pleasures. After the tender left, had a walk about on
deck with some of our old friends going on to Sydney. Took
good stock of the new passengers, but did not think much of some
of them. Had a talk with Jim?s friend, Mr. Kelly, who was the
first to wish me a happy New Year ere he went below to be in
readiness for the first watch of the year. The anchor was to
be weighed at midnight, which process I sat up to see. So
we sailed for Sydney before the New Year was half-an-hour old.
Between eleven and twelve I was on deck with some of our
passengers and took up a seat near the breakwater to listen for
eight bells (midnight). As soon as it had gone eight bells on the
different vessels lying in the bay, a number of rockets and fire-
works were seen going up from several of the steamers not far
from us. It was a lovely night, and the electric lights hung all
up the masts of the F.M.M. ? Yarra? added much to the display
of other lights; but, strange to say, all was stillness on board the
? Austral,? and there was much disappointment amongst the
passengers that we should be behind in even this. We were not
long in that mind, however, for we saw some beautiful rockets,
&c., go up from the first class promenade deck, but who the
thoughtful person was who had brought them on board we never
heard. Immediately after this, I wished all generally in our
group a happy New Year, and ran off to our old quarters on the
second class high deck to find some old friends, and to wish them
a very happy New Year. They were just ready waiting to start
? Auld Langsyne,? which we sung hand in hand throughout. I
then returned to watch the anchor come up, and while there with
several others, the Scotch fellows came along and asked me to
start ?Auld Langsyne? again, so we had another go at it. I left


after the first one or two verses, as the anchor was now safely
tied up, and we were once more
" Sailing, sailing over the bounding main,
Ana many a stormy wind shall blow
Ere Jack comes home again,?
It will be only six weeks or so when Jack shall be home again, if
all goes well; but when shall we, the poor ? new chums,? get
home again 1 Turned into bunk a little before the ? wee short ?oor
ayont the twal?.?
New Year's Day, Ist January, 1885. ?Spent the day very
quietly writing, packing, and wandering about. I anxiously
enquired at several of the crew when we were likely to get into
Sydney, but could get nothing very definite except from Mr. Kelly,
who said he was quite sure it would be Friday evening. After
watching the sailors dancing for some time, I went below, as there
was nothing going on although it was New Year?s Day. Wrote
one or two letters, and turned in so as to be up as early as possible
on the morrow.
Friday, 2nd. ?So busy packing that I almost forgot about
breakfast until I was reminded of it by one of the principal
stewards, who passed as I was tugging away at one of my well-
packed boxes. But in fun I answered very indifferently that I
should soon be ashore and did not wish anything from them now.
He in return took me at my word, and quietly locked me up, boxes
and all, saying that 1 had better stay there and finish my packing
ere we reached Sydney. This bantering joke was all very well,
but I was not quite willing to go without breakfast, so for spite I
rang for our bedroom steward to bring me some porridge and milk
and sugar, which he did, handing it in by the window ventilator
above the top cabin, with which I was on a level standing on the
top of my boxes. Spent the greater part of the day on the look-
out as we sailed up the east coast. At the distance we were from
the shore I could not see anything distinctly. What I did see
led me to think it was not a land to be desired, being too dry and
sandy-looking. Shortly after dinner time we rounded The Heads,
outside of which the health officer and pilot came on board. There
seemed to be so many entrances guarded by great rocks that it
does indeed require great care to steer through such a maze.


Inside Tile Heads we passed Watson?s Bay on the south or left
side going up. Here a great many artillerymen and others came
out to spy and afterwards to cheer us, and at several places on the
way up the ? Austral? was most heartily cheered. We were now
getting very near Sydney, but it was fast becoming dark, and
though tea time, few cared to stay many minutes below for a last
refreshing cup. I had spent the greater part of the day near the
breakwater at the fore part of the vessel so as to have a good look
out, but afterwards found a perch on the top of a pile of ropes
behind the entrance to the sailors? companion-way, and from there
I had a splendid view all the evening of both north and south
shores as we sailed up. Saw the passenger boats come out, when
there was a grand rush to the ship?s side to see the arrivals from
Sydney. But no communication could be made until the anchor
was dropped. This was done at seven P.M., and, strange to say, in
almost the exact place where she went down on her-last voyage.
It was a lovely evening. The sun was setting just behind Sydney,
leaving a beautiful gold and crimson sky above, and these bright
colours were reflected on the sparkling water. No sooner had the
anchor dropped than the rush of Sydney friends began, but they did
not care to stay on board longer than they could possibly avoid, being
anxious to carry off their newly-arrived friends from home in safety,
in case the ?Austral? should take it into her head to roll over
again and go below. I kept a sharp look out for Jim, but he did
not come, as we were in much earlier than reported. I was rather
disappointed seeing almost everybody going, but on the other hand
I was glad he did not come as it became so soon dark and the bay
also grew very squally. Several passengers were teasing and
questioning me?? Has he not come for you yet 1? etc., and to keep
up the joke by not making them any the wiser who was to meet
me, I answered ? No, he has not come yet; but I know he will
come.? I was wandering about still on the look out and came
across Jim?s friend, Mr. Kelly, who told me he was sure Jim would
not come to-night, so I took a short stroll about and then a long
look at the lights of Sydney, until thought after thought passed in
.my mind and I began to realize that the voyage was really over
and how far from Father, Mother, home, and all old friends I was,
and gave vent to my loneliness in a quiet ?greet? before going


below to turn in for the last time in all probability, and again to
hear the familiar cry ?Lights out!? and our nearest cabin friends
quoting?
? The shades of night had fallen fast
As through the alleys down there pass?d,
Without a fear, without a doubt,
A youth, whose duty was to shout?
?Lights out I?
? His face was marked by many emotions,
Due perhaps to o'er-night potions;
But his one redeeming feature
Was his voice to every creature?
? Lights out 1 ?
? ?Oh stay !oh stay !? the old man said,
? For I am not yet into bed:
My watch unwound, my scarf untied,?
But stem that awful voice replied?
?Lights out 1?
? ?Wait just a minute,? the maiden cried,
Stem duty, alas ! decorum defied;
One foot in cabin, hand on handle,
As now he quietly snuffed the candle?
? Lights out 1 ?
? The maiden wept and tore her hair.
And said ?twas more than she could bear;
The young man turned, and looked, and sighed,
But still his clarion voice replied?
?Lights out I?
? Next, when he came to the saloon.
The general cry was ? Much too soon
Bribes were offered, but all in vain.
? ?Tis worth my place,? said he in pain?
?Lights out!?
?If, after all that has been said,
At eleven o?clock you?re all in bed.
Silence will reign at cabin door,
The tmmpet voice be heard no more?
?Lights out!??
?Tis so on board ship without the electric light, but with it, we are
less ceremoniously treated by being in instantaneous darkness, and
occasionally before ? eleven o?clock.? The preceding verses were


taken from a ? Lusitania" Journal, and amused us much during
the voyage, as did also some of the ?quesses? which we appro-
priated, being applied originally to other vessels. ? When is the
? Austral ? like a diamond pin t When she is on the breast of a
heavy swell.? ?Why is the ?Austral? in the Suez Canal like a
well-behaved young lady i Because she steers clear of the buoys
and leaves the swell behind her.? There was an ? Austral ?
Journal or newspaper of some kind, but I did not see anything
special in it that I remember.
Saturday, 3rd. ?Had a good sleep, and when about half awake
this morning heard the quartermaster?s whistle and some one in
our alley saying we were going to be tugged up to Circular Quay
immediately, so I was soon wide awake after that and dressed as
fast as possible. By the time I got on deck we were very near
the quay, and though only eight o?clock there were a good many
people waiting for us to come in. A coal barge lay between
us and the quay, so that it took some time to fix a gangway
across it from the ? Austral.? I had been looking over and over
the crowd several times for Jim, but could not make him out
until Mr. Kelly told me where to look. It was fully twenty
minutes before anyone was allowed on board, but then there was
a rush, and Jim was among the first lot. ?So he did come for
you after all,? said some of my shipmates. It was getting on for
ten o?clock, so we went down to the saloon and had a cup of tea
until the luggage was being taken up. Jim had a cart waiting,
so I had my cabin luggage taken off by one of the stewards, and
soon the rest came to view and was carted off to the station, all
except the case for ? Coz.,? which could not then be found. While
waiting for the luggage the first thing I did was to haul Jim off
to get me some fruit at the nearest and decentest fruit stall on the
quay. I longed for some fresh fruit after having had my taste so
well satisfied at Melbourne. Jim got me some beautiful pears
and peaches, and as we were returning to the ?Austral? along
the quay we met Captain Charlton. I was sorry this was to
be the last time, for during the whole voyage his kindly, free,
and genial manner to everybody added much to the enjoyment of
the voyage. This was especially the case in the interest he took
in all the amusements got up by and for the passengers, such as


the ?Grand Egyptian Ball? at Port Said, ?Ye Fancie Faire,?
?Ye Fancie Ball,? the concerts, and the sports. He entered
into these with great spirit, and was really the life of all the
entertainments which came off during the last three weeks,
after the most dangerous part of the voyage was over. Thus
it is that much depends on the Captain to make or mar the
pleasures of the voyage, for when Jim came out by the ? Orient?
their Captain was as stuck up and cold and distant as could be,
so that the passengers were pushed quite on their own resources
to amuse themselves as best they could. When I asked Mr.
Northcote, the Chief Officer, for any information, I found him
exceedingly pleasant, agreeable, and willing to advise, particularly
so at Melbourne when the time of sailing for Sydney was so
uncertain.. Except during the few times they condescended to
favour our quarters with an inspection, we saw little of the other
officers, and in fact I scarcely yet know their names. The Purser?s
berth on board the ? Austral? was no mean position everybody
knew, but the bumptious importance of Mr. Gibbon would have
made all believe he was second to none, not even the Captain.
When asked for any information, he would, after a great deal of pre-
tended consequence, become very condescending, but all his talking
went for less than the time wasted. By straight-forwardness he
would have saved himself much time and trouble. This all came
out in the constant disagreeableness about the giving in and getting
out of our letters. Had I been able at Suez and Aden to have
gone ashore with my letters I should not have troubled him or the
Orient Co. either. Of course I could have accepted the very kind
offers of those going ashore to post for me, but they would not
let me stamp my letters, so I gave them to the Purser. In great
contrast to that big man?s pompousness was the open, frank, and
obliging manners and politeness of the sailors, especially when they
were most tormented taking up the luggage on baggage days. I
had not the slightest trouble with mine?it came up, I took
out what I wanted, and it was put down again quite safely each
of the three times during our six weeks? sail. The stewards, both
table and cabin, and the stewardesses were all very polite and
attentive. My cabin was one of the nearest to the dining saloon and
pantries, so that it was very convenient for getting boiling water


to make an afternoon cup of tea, and though there were fifteen or
sixteen stewards going about all day and I had a great many of
my belongings lying about, the lock of my box having been broken
coming on board, yet I never missed a single article, though I was
often on deck the greater part of the day. The only thing that
we did not like in the second saloon was the dining arrangements.
There were more passengers than there was accommodation for all
at once, consequently if anyone took a fancy to a particular seat
(which was really the case generally) they had to take their place
early to secure it, or wait until the second breakfast, dinner, or
tea began to be served after the first lot had finished. This was a
subject of almost constant annoyance to everybody in the saloon,
especially when elderly ladies or gentlemen could not get a seat
owing to the children of two years and upwards each occupying a
chair and each taking up a waiter?s time to serve them with the
best of everything, while their elders had to wait and take the
warmest of what was left or want. But to return to my first few
hours in Sydney. Having sent off all my luggage but the one
case not yet come to light, Jim and I went off to meet Mr.
Jordan in the city, when we had lunch together at one of the
grand new coffee palaces, after which we returned by the Botanic
Gardens to the ? Austral.? The case was the first thing we saw
on the wharf, so Jim and I took it in a hansom (no cabs in
Sydney) to the station. Of Sydney I cannot form any distinct
idea, having had such a short time there and only in the city.
The streets are narrow, rather irregular some of them, and a good
few pretty steep. On our way to the station we passed several
splendid large buildings. Fully half-an-hour?s run brought us
to Granville, where, close to the station, is Mr. Eayner?s office,
and there we waited until Mrs. Rayner and Mrs. Richardson
and children, with Miss Richardson, arrived from Sydney, where
we had met them in the morning at Circular Quay on the way
down the harbour by steamer to Manly Beach for the day. Tom
or Jim had by this time got the buggy to drive the first instalment
of us to Woodstock. Miss Smith, a friend of Mrs. Rayner?s, had
been at home all day, and had everything waiting ready for tea as
soon as Mr. Rayner, Tom, and Jim arrived. After a very
substantial tea in a nice, large, airy dining-room with door open


out to the garden, the lamps were lit, and we had a round of music
in the drawing-room. Mr. Jordan gave us some excellent music,
mostly selections from the best masters. Spent a very enjoyable
evening, then had some supper, after which we were advised by
Mr. Rayner to get soon to bed (not to ? turn in?), as we should
require to be up early for all to get ready for church.
