CDrber of Jitrfiict
Lead, kindly Light, amid the encir-
cling gloom
I was not ever thus, nor pray’d that
Thou
Lead Thou me on.
Shouldst lead me on ;
The night is dark and I am far from
home :
I loved to choose and see my path ;
but now
Lead Thou me on.
Lead Thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet ; I do not ask to
see
I loved the garish day, and spite of
fears
The distant scene ; one step enough
for me.
Pride ruled my will ; remember not
past years.
So long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone.
And with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile. Amen.

REV. JOHN BIDWELL, 8.A.,
Grand Chaplain
Hymn.
Abide with me : fast falls the even-
tide ;
The darkness deepens ; Lord, with
me abide :
When other helpers fail and comforts
flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with
me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little
day ;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories
pass away ;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, who changest not, abide with
Come not in terrors, as the King of
kings ;
But kind and good, with healing in
Thy wings ;
Tears for all woes, a heart for every
plea ;
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide
with me.
I need Thy presence every passing
hour :
What but Thy grace can foil the
tempter’s power ?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay
can be ?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh,
abide with me.
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to
bless :
Ills have no weight, and tears no bit-
terness :
Where is death’s sting ? where, grave
thy victory ?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with
me.
Hold Thou Thy cross before my clos-
ing eyes :
Shine through the gloom and point
me to the skies ;
Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s
vain shadows flee ;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with
me. Amen.


Hymn
{To he sung at the
graveside.)
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Nothing in my hand I bring ;
Let me hide myself in Thee ;
Simply to Thy cross I cling ;
Let the water and the blood
Naked, come to Thee for dress ;
From Thy riven side which flow’d,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace ;
Be of sin the double cure,
Foul, I to the fountain fly ;
Cleanse me from its guilt and
power.
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.
While I draw this fleeting breath,
Not the labours of my hands
When my eyelids close in death,
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands ;
When I soar through tracts un-
Could my zeal no respite know,
known,
Could my tears for ever flow,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
All for sin could not atone,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Thou must save, and Thou alone.
Let me hide myself in Thee.
Amen.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Christ, have mercy upon us.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Prayers

Nunc Dimittis
now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace : according to Thy
word.
For mine eyes have seen : Thy salvation ;
Which Thou hast prepared : before the face of all people ;

Israel.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son : and to the Holy Ghost ;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be : world without end.
Amen.
