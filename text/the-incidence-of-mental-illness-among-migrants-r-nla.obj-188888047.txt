CHAPTER 1
FINDINGS
1. The Committee defined a migrant as a person who has resided in
Australia for less than five years. For the purposes of this statistical survey,
the admission of persons for the first time to a mental institution was accepted
as a basis for assessing the incidence of mental illness.
2. It was found that no adequate Australia-wide study of the incidence
of mental illness among migrants had been made previously. Accordingly,
with the approval of the State directors of mental health, a survey was
undertaken of oversea-born persons, who, after reaching Australia between
1946 and 1957, were admitted to mental hospitals for the first time in that
period.
3. Using this criterion, there were 3,869 cases. Applying the concept
of a “five-year” migrant, there were 2,316 persons, who had been admitted
within five years of arrival, and had reached Australia between 1948 and
1952.
4. An analysis of the data provided the following findings—
(a) If the first-admission rates for displaced persons are eliminated
from the pattern, migrant rates in Australia can be accepted
as being below those of a typical Western community.
(b) Best authoritative opinion places the annual first-admission rate
in a typical Western community at 0.7 per 1,000. The
migrant average annual first-admission rate for arrivals
between 1948 and 1952, including displaced persons, was also
0.7 per 1,000. If displaced persons are excluded, the migrant
figure is 0.46 per 1,000. When account is taken of the
difference in the age structure of the Australian-born and
migrant populations, the migrant rate is still further reduced,
to 0.38 per 1,000.
(c) There is a connexion between the higher rates found among
migrants who arrived during 1949 and 1950 and the very
large intake of displaced persons in those years.
(d) It is not surprising to find that displaced persons, with their
unhappy background of war experience, have shown a greater
tendency than other migrants to suffer from mental illness.
(e) Age and sex have considerable effects on migrant incidence rates.
Persons aged 20 to 49 years had the highest rates, while male
rates were higher than female.
(f) Among first-admission cases entering hospital during the first five
years of residence, almost 50 per cent, of both males and
females aged 20 to 29 years were admitted by the end of
the second year. Among those aged 30 to 49 *years, this
trend was not evident, as they were evenly distributed over
the five-year period,
9134/61.—3


(g) Estimated “five-year” first-admission rates for migrants who
reached Australia between 1953 and 1957 do not differ
materially from first-admission rates for migrants (excluding
displaced persons) who reached Australia between 1948 and
1952.
(h) The concept that a migrant is a person who has resided in
Australia for less than five years could be more widely
employed in research.
(i) Australia’s procedures for the screening of migrants generally
succeed in excluding mentally ill and potentially mentally ill
applicants for immigration. The findings of the survey vindi-
cate these procedures.
(j) Consideration should be given by the appropriate authorities to
the introduction throughout Australian mental institutions of
a standard admission card. Future research, in this and other
fields, would thereby be greatly facilitated.


CHAPTER 2
INTRODUCTION
5. When this Committee began its investigation, it was soon established
that no adequate statistical study of the incidence of mental illness among
migrants had been made. It will be appreciated that a nation-wide survey
is outside the powers of the individual State governments, in whose province
mental health lies, and beyond the resources of individual psychiatrists
and other interested persons. However, despite this lack of data, conflicting
statements have been made from time to time regarding the numbers of
migrants suffering from mental disorders. The Committee recognized the
need to obtain reliable information regarding the incidence of mental
illness.
6. This report is based on a statistical, and not on a clinical study.
The aim has been to find the number of oversea-born persons who, after
reaching Australia during the years 1946 to 1957, were admitted for the
first time to mental institutions in that period.
7. The Committee is particularly conscious of the special function of
this type of report, which is designed as a guide to immigration policy and
administration. It should in no way be regarded as a report to, or for,
the medical profession. The preparation of such a study, obviously, would
not be the function of this Committee.
8. This report attempts to uncover any broad problem area that may
exist. An analysis in great detail is not required. Even within the limits set,
therefore, this study lays no claim to being definitive.
9. It was realized that, before a statistical analysis could be com-
menced, a firm definition should be laid down as to who were to be regarded
as migrants.
10. There is wide acceptance of a concept that a migrant is a person
who has spent less than five years in his new country. This view is to
some extent supported by official practice. The Commonwealth Migration
Act 1958 makes such a distinction, and non-British persons may apply for
naturalization after residing five years in Australia. Sir Harry Wunderly (l)
informed the Committee that, at the 1958 Conference of the World Federa-
tion of Mental Health at Vienna/ 2 * most delegates supported the five-year
definition. On the other hand, some felt that the transition period could
last as long as ten years.
11. In their study of migration and mental disease in New York State,
Malzberg and Lee (1956) wrote —
“ For the three fiscal years ended June 30, 1941, first admissions were classed by
number of years of residence in New York State prior to entry into hospitals for
mental disease. Persons who had lived in the State less than five years before first
admission were considered migrants, and persons who had lived there all their lives or
five years or more before first admission were considered non-migrants.” (3)
(*) Sir Harry reported to the Government in 1950, 1952 and 1956 on procedures for the medical
screening of migrants, after investigations undertaken at all overseas migration offices
C) The theme of the Conference was “ Mental Health and Immigration An account of the pro-
ceedings has been published under the title “ Uprooting and Resettlement” (I 960).
( 3 ) The full details of texts quoted are listed in the bibliography in Appendix “C”.


12. The Committee has used throughout the definition of a migrant as a
person who has resided in Australia for less than five years.
First Admission Rates as a Definition of Mental Illness for the Purpose of
this Report
13. For statistical purposes, first admissions to mental institutions were
accepted as a basis for assessing the incidence of mental illness.
14. It was noted that first-admission rates had been widely used by
sociologists and statisticians for similar studies. Malzberg (1955), in his
study of mental-illness statistics for the State of New York, wrote —
“ Obviously the number of first admissions is less than the true total of new cases,
for an unknown number of mental cases is treated by private practitioners, and another
unknown total of such cases never receives any medical treatment. The latter observa-
tion applies more particularly to the less severe types of mental disease . . . One
must, therefore, asssume that the relation between the total of first admissions and the
unknown total of new cases arriving in the State in the same period is constant from
year to year, or sufficiently constant for practical purposes.”
15. With these reservations/ 4 ) Malzberg adopted the first-admission
analysis. Reid (1960) made a further comment —
“It is clear . . . that first-admission rates are likely to be most useful when
the whole community is served by the hospital system whose records are available.”
16. Other investigators in this field, such as Goldhamer and Marshall
(1955), Wallis and Roberts (1957) and Halevi (1960), also favoured this
approach.
( 4 ) The implications of these, and other factors, are more fully discussed in Chapter 6.


CHAPTER 3
METHOD OF ANALYSIS
17. For the purpose of this study it was necessary to obtain first-
admission data from all State mental institutions.
18. The regular statistical returns from State directors of mental health
to the Commonwealth Department of Health were thoroughly examined.
It was learned that these statistics were not strictly comparable, because of
varying methods employed in compilation. More important was the fact
that there was little information on first admissions, migrant or Australian-
born.
19. Sir Harry Wunderly agreed to approach the various State directors
of mental health, outlining the purpose of the project and seeking their
advice and co-operation in the task.
20. He emphasized to the various State directors the necessity of
obtaining first-admission data on a uniform basis, and gave positive assur-
ances that information collected on individual cases would be treated con-
fidentially.
21. He also pointed out that it was planned to make a case card for
each first admission to avoid errors likely to arise, for example, from duplica-
tion caused by interstate movement or from change of name. It was finally
agreed that the following particulars would be sought—
(a) full name;
(b) age on admission;
(c) sex;
(d) marital status;
(e) birthplace;
(f) date of arrival in Australia;
(g) date of first admission;
(h) name of institution;
(i) subsequent action, for example, transfers, date of discharge, date
of death.
22. Sir Harry reported that one aspect of the survey, stemming from
differing State attitudes towards the commitment of alcoholics, remained
unresolved. There was no broad area of agreement between State authorities
on this particular question. On Sir Harry’s recommendation, it was decided
that these cases would not be covered in the survey. (1 >
23. All States agreed to co-operate in this important task. However, a
preliminary survey revealed that the work of extracting information from
the registers would place an unacceptable strain on State Government clerical
staff in mental hospitals. The Minister for Immigration assisted by approving
the part-time secondment of a number of experienced Commonwealth officers
who were particularly skilled in searching official records. In addition, a
senior officer of the Department of Immigration in Canberra was appointed
to co-ordinate the work of his colleagues in the various States.
I 1) A paper contributed to the “ Report of the Victorian Mental Hygiene Authority for the Year
ended 31st December, 1958 ”, noted that the incidence of alcoholism among European-born patients
admitted to Royal Park Hospital, Melbourne, was far lower than among Australian-born patients.
While this is an important observation, part of the explanation may lie in the differing age structures
of the two populations. In addition, potential migrants suffering from this illness are deterred from
entry by medical screening.
9134/61.—4


24. As an intimation of the magnitude of the task, it was discovered that,
in one State alone, a grand total of 30,000 names of Australian and
overseas-born persons was entered on institution registers between 1946
and 1957.
25. The work of searching these registers was pushed ahead as soon
as administrative arrangements were made. When the first returns reached
Canberra it was observed that, through differing systems of registration,
there were serious gaps in the data. For example, while details of age
on admission and birth place were easily obtained from the registers, the
same source gave little, if any, indication of date of arrival in Australia.
26. To fill such gaps, the scope of the search was broadened to include
official records held by the Commonwealth Government. Among sources
consulted were ships’ nominal rolls, aliens’ registers, case records of social
workers, and deportation and repatriation returns.
27. After full analysis, it was found that there were 3,869 first admissions
to mental institutions of migrants who had arrived between 1946 and 1957.
28. Information on the case cards was coded, and the Commonwealth
Statistician, after preparing punch-cards, machine-counted the data. From
the resulting tabulations, statistics were extracted.
29. To assist their work, the Committee assembled a number of references
relating to mental-health surveys conducted overseas. It was noted that as
early as 1848, in the State of Massachusetts, U.S.A., Dr. Pliny Earle (2) not
only realized the significance of the distinction between first and total
admissions to mental institutions, but also gave details of the age distribution
of these first admissions. W. B. Hurd (1937), while discussing the racial
origins and nativity of the Canadian people, maintained that —
“the difference in incidence (of mental illness leading to institutional treatment)
between the Canadian-born and the foreign-born as a group is entirely attributable to
peculiarities of age and sex distribution. That between the Canadian and British-born
is more than accounted for by the same causes. It seems to follow that differences
in age and sex are likely to be of major importance in explaining the differing incidence
as between the smaller nativity groups as well.”
30. Later workers such as Malzberg and Lee (1956), Goldhamer and
Marshall (1953), Frumkin (1953), Kleiner and Parker (1959), and Halevi
(1960), adopted the method of age- and sex-specific analysis of first
admissions.
31. The same method was followed. At this stage, also, a further
decision was reached. While the survey covers a period of twelve years,
it would be very misleading to analyse first-admission figures in such a way
as to give a similar weight to each annual migrant intake. (3) It was obvious
that few, if any, valid conclusions could be drawn from such overall analysis.
To eliminate this particular difficulty, it was decided to examine incidence
rates by year of arrival. If, for example, the numbers of persons from the
1949 intake, who were admitted to institutions for the first time within a
period of five years after arrival, were compared with a similar group drawn
from the 1952 intake, a useful indication of trends could be obtained.
( 2 ) As quoted by Goldhamer and Marshall (1953).
( 8 ) For example, persons arriving during 1956 have had less time in which to fall ill than the group
who reached Australia in 1946.


32. Keeping in mind the definition of a migrant as a person in his first
five years of residence, it was decided to analyse the distribution of male
and female rates by ten-year age groups, for yearly intakes, over a five-year
period of residence in Australia,
33. Finally, the population from which to calculate each year’s age-
specific rates per 1,000 persons would be based on the annual statistics of
long-term and permanent arrivals in Australia.
34. The implications arising from the decision to compare incidence rates
for individual years of arrival over a five-year period of residence were
now considered. Table No. 1 (4) was prepared showing first-admission cases
who were admitted to institutions within five years of arrival, analysing the
data by year of arrival and by age on admission in ten-year groups.
35. As the data collected concerned cases up to the end of 1957, arrivals
after 1952 cannot be included in an analysis of first admissions within five
years of arrival.
36. A well-known statistical principle lays down that, if valid inferences
are to be drawn, sub-groups in a table should include not fewer than 50
cases, and individual cells in the sub-group not fewer than five. On this
basis, cases occurring among migrants who arrived during 1946 and 1947
were discarded. Those cases occurring within two age groups, 0-9 years,
and 60 years and over, were also eliminated, because of the small numbers
in each of the cells.
37. To summarize, it was necessary to restrict the five-year analysis (s)
to cases drawn from annual migrant intakes between 194,8 and 1952.
Further, the 0-9 year and 60 years and over age groups were discarded.
38. It was also desirable to discover, as far as possible, trends in rates
for migrants who arrived in 1953-57. This necessitated using data for a
shorter period after arrival than five years. In Table No. 2, first-admission
cases which occurred within two years of arrival are set out for the annual
migrant intakes from 1949 to 1955.
39. It will be seen from this table that, while male sub-groups were
sufficiently large, female sub-groups remained below the minimum size of
50 among the groups who arrived between the years 1951 and 1955. It
appeared, therefore, that an analysis of three-year rates for males and
females for 1953 and 1954, and two-year male rates for 1953-55, might
provide a satisfactory basis for an investigation of first-admissions among
migrants who arrived between 1953 and 1957. This will be the subject
of a later chapter.
40. From Table No. 3 it was noted that there were 2,316 cases from the
1948-52 intakes, who had been admitted for the first time within five years
of arrival. Of these, 1,601, or 69.1 per cent., were males, and 715, or 30.9
per cent., were females. Of the 1,601 male cases 98.0 per cent, were
between the ages of 10 and 59 years on admission, the groups with which
this study would be primarily concerned. In comparison, of the 715 female
cases, 93.7 per cent, were between the ages of 10 and 59 years on admission.
( 4 ) Statistical tables are set out in Appendix “A ”,
(') The terms “ five-year ”, “ three-year ”, and “ two-year ”, applied to rates, always refer to first*
admissions within five, three or two years of arrival in Australia. Where rates are prefixed by reference
to a year, e.g. “ 1951 rates ”, this refers to rates for migrants who arrived in Australia in 1951, and not
to migrant admissions to mental institutions during that year.


41. Table No. 3 shows that 93.9 per cent, of all male cases occurred
among those aged 20 to 49 years on admission, compared with 69.3 per
cent, in these age groups on arrival for the overall 1948-52 migrant intake. (6)
Furthermore, 77.2 per cent, of male cases on admission occurred in the
20- to 39-year groups as compared with 54.6 per cent, on arrival of all
male migrants.
42. The Table also shows that 85.5 per cent, of female first-admission
cases occurred among those aged 20-49 years on admission. In comparison,
those aged 20-49 years in the total female migrant intake into Australia
during this period represented 69.0 per cent, of the total.
43. This simple study established the importance of the age and sex
analysis of first-admission cases and prepared the way for a detailed analysis
of the data.
( 6 ) This approach has not taken age-shifts into account. However, this element of bias has been
corrected when calculating incidence rates.


CHAPTER 4
FIRST-ADMISSION RATES—1948-52 MIGRANT INTAKES
44. The principal aim of this chapter is to measure and compare age-
specific* 1 > first-admission rates of persons who had arrived in the annual
migrant intakes between 1948 and 1952, and were admitted to a mental
hospital for the first time within five years of arrival. Male and female
rates are compared; in addition, some of the possible effects of the varying
composition of national groups in the migrant intakes from year to year are
discussed. Where years are quoted, they refer to the year of arrival in
Australia.
45. In order to avoid repetition of certain phrases, the expression
“ rates ”, unless qualified, is defined as age-specific, first-admission rates of
oversea-born persons who have resided less than five years in Australia.
46. Firstly, it was observed that the rates for the years 1949 and 1950,
set out in Table No. 4, were considerably higher than the average rates for
the entire period. Large numbers of displaced persons reached Australia in
those two years. A possible connexion with these rates and the large-scale
intake of displaced persons will be covered later in this chapter.
47. A second observation was that the rates for females, particularly
those in the important 20- to 49-year groups, were significantly lower than
comparable male rates. This was in line with findings in similar studies
overseas. (2)
48. The third and perhaps most important aspect brought out by Table
No. 4 was the effect of age on incidence rates. The rates for each year
form most interesting patterns, and can be examined most effectively by
reference to Figure No. 1.* 3) Here, male and female rates are plotted on
separate graphs which show a regular pattern, commencing with low rates
in the 10- to 19-year group, rising to a peak somewhere in the 20- to 49-year
groups, and then falling sharply in the 50- to 59-year group. Sir Harry
Wunderly reported that the pattern was explained by these factors—
(i) mental illness is relatively rare in persons under fifteen years, and
mental defectives are usually easily excluded by overseas
medical screening;
(ii) much of the mental illness which occurs in the later age groups
is the result of cardio-vascular disease —a degenerative process;
and
(iii) it is often difficult and at times impossible to detect the potential
psychotics—and it is in the 20- to 49-year groups that these
mental illnesses most usually occur.
49. The graphs in Figure No. 1 clearly underlined observations made
earlier of the need for a much closer analysis of the intakes during the
years 1949 and 1950. In addition, bearing in mind the largely symmetrical
pattern formed by the incidence rates, the non-symmetrical form of male
rates for 1952 and of female rates for 1951 called for further analysis.
(*) “ Age-specific ” signifies that rates have been calculated either for each individual age, or for
age-groups. In this Report, 10-year age-groups are used.
( 2 ) After these ages, female rates tend to equal and later exceed male rates.
( a ) All charts are in Appendix “B ”.
9134/61.—5


50. When first noting the high rates occurring in the 1949 and 1950
intakes, the Committee decided it would be necessary to see if a connexion
existed between these rates and the very large intake of displaced persons
in those years.
51. Although a formal agreement between Australia and the Interna-
tional Refugee Organization was signed in July, 1947, it was not until 1949
that large numbers of displaced persons were able to reach this country.
The world-wide shortage of shipping forced many thousands, whose migra-
tion had already been approved, to face a long, dispiriting wait in embarka-
tion camps.
52. Australia, aware of the urgency of the problem, agreed to take
larger numbers as soon as the shipping position improved. The situation
changed dramatically in 1949, and, in the two years ended December, 1950,
145,000 displaced persons reached Australia under the International Refugee
Organization Scheme.
53. Because of the wide difference in background of this group from that
of all other migrants, it was decided to make a detailed analysis of first-
admission rates for the 1949 and 1950 migrant intakes. These are set out
in Table No. 5.
54. This table shows considerable differences between the rates for dis-
placed persons and for all other migrants. These are too great to be
accounted for by random fluctuations. The weight of this evidence con-
vinced the Committee that the higher overall rates for the 1949 and 1950
migrant intakes, compared with the rates for other years, were not typical,
being primarily a result of the large intake of displaced persons.
55. On the other hand, it was felt that the higher rates for displaced
persons, compared with all other migrants, cannot be attributed to inadequate
medical screening. The procedures used by Australian doctors were
described by International Refugee Organization officials as more searching
than those of other countries, as high standards of acceptability were applied.
56. As was to be expected, the results of this special investigation empha-
sized that the record of mental ill-health among displaced persons should
not be regarded as typical for all migrants.
57. Figure No. 1 reveals that the largely symmetrical form of male rates
for the earlier years was replaced by a non-symmetrical pattern for the 1952
migrant intake. The main feature was that the rate for the 20- to 29-year
group rose sharply in comparison with those aged 30 to 39 years.
58. The rates shown in Table No. 6 indicate that, when displaced persons
are excluded, the maximum rate for the combined 1948-52 intake also
occurred in the 20- to 29-year group, replacing the 30- to 39-year group,
which had the highest rate for the overall intake.
59. It was also noted that the proportion of displaced persons in the
male migrant intake fell from 45.2 per cent, and 39.4 per cent, in 1949 and
1950 respectively to 8.5 per cent, in 1951 and 1.6 per cent, in 1952. It
was thus reasonable to expect that 1951 rates were transitional, and that in
1952 the highest rate would occur among the 20- to 29-year group. This
rate was unusually high, and that because of the number of cases involved,
is confirmed by Figure No. 1. However, it was apparent that this latter
chance factors could not be solely responsible.


60. Except for 1952-53, Australia has been fortunate that, in the period
under consideration, she enjoyed a sustained demand for labour. Accord-
ingly, the principal task was to recruit suitable workers to take advantage of
the employment opportunities,
61. In 1952, however, some migrants arrived when employment was
difficult to obtain because of temporary economic adjustment.
62. In order to examine the possible effects of this situation, it was
decided to study the rates for assisted male Italian migrants. This choice
was not made through any evidence that Italians might generally be more
susceptible to mental illness than other national groups. This was the first
year of assisted Italian migration, and those who arrived were predominantly
single men, aged 20 to 29 years, frequently without relatives or friends
in Australia.
63. It was found that the rate for Italian assisted male migrants (who
were largely unskilled) was greater (6.3 compared to 5.3 per 1,000) than
that for all other male migrants in the same age group. On this evidence,
it was felt that short-term factors may have contributed to the high rate
experienced among 1952 arrivals aged 20 to 29 years. This was to some
extent confirmed by later experience with the 1955 intake.
64. Figure No. 1 also shows a generally symmetrical form for female
rates. The 1951 rates, however, deviated from the usual pattern, reaching
a distinct peak in the 40- to 49-year group.
65. After several possible factors were examined, there appeared to be
no satisfactory explanation, and it was felt that random fluctuations caused
this variation.
66. It should be recognized that females aged 40 to 49 comprised a
much smaller proportion of the 1951 female migrant intake than did males
aged 20 to 29 of the 1952 male intake. Furthermore, the number of
cases involved was very much smaller. Much less significance, therefore,
can be attached to. these figures.


CHAPTER 5
PATTERNS OF FIRST ADMISSIONS—ANNUAL
DISTRIBUTION OF CASES
67. This chapter has two objectives: firstly, to examine the claim
that a majority of migrant cases were admitted during the first two years
of residence; secondly, to provide some of the data which will be used
in estimating probable five-year rates for migrants who arrived after 1952.
The latter will be the subject of the next chapter.
68. The task was begun by examining what may be called the
“ anatomy ” of five-year rates, and then searching for indications of an
overall yearly pattern in the cumulative build-up of rates.
69. The years 1948, 1950 and 1952 were selected for this study, and
the yearly build-up of rates is shown in Table No. 7. It was seen that the
pattern of male rates established during the first year of residence was
largely preserved throughout the remainder of the period. This was not
the case for females.
70. This pattern is more clearly demonstrated in the graphs in Figure
No. 2. It was seen that persons in the 20- to 29-year group entered earlier
rather than later in their period of residence in Australia, and this general
pattern was maintained regardless of the level of rates. However, it was
not possible to make similar observations regarding the more mature groups.
71. The female rates shown in Figure No. 2 underline the very low
incidence in comparison with males. It is interesting that the symmetry
in the pattern of female rates at the five-year stage was not a feature
of the earlier years.
72. It was evident that a more detailed statistical analysis was required.
Accordingly, a hypothesis that the annual percentage distribution of cases
did not vary over the five years was tested. If this were correct, 20 per
cent, of the total number of cases, in each individual age-group, would
have been admitted in each year.
73. The first step was to calculate, for males and females in the three
main age groups (20-29, 30-39 and 40-49 years), the annual percentage
distribution of cases by period of residence before first admission. These
percentages were plotted on graphs, forming “scatter diagrams ”, for each
male and female age group, from which were calculated trend or “ regres-
sion ” lines.
74. These regression lines are shown in Figure No. 3. Also, on each
graph, a horizontal “ hypothesis ” line has been drawn at the 20 per cent,
level of the Y-axis.
75. The significance of this analysis is simply explained. If the regres-
sion line is parallel or almost parallel to the hypothesis line, it can be
inferred that admissions are fairly evenly distributed throughout the five-
year period. On the other hand, if the line slopes from top-left to bottom-
right of the graph, cases tend to be admitted earlier rather than later.
Again, if the regression line slopes upward from left to right, there is
a tendency for such cases to be admitted later rather than earlier.


76. Figure No. 3 shows that almost 50 per cent, of both male and
female admissions from the 20- to 29-year group entered hospital before
the end of the second year of residence. While random fluctuations of
nearly 5 per cent, may be expected to occur on either side of the regression
lines, this analysis supports the contention that admissions in this age
group are not equally distributed among the five yearly periods.
77. On the other hand, the regression lines for the two older age groups
show that an equal annual distribution of each 100 cases over the five-year
period can be expected.


CHAPTER 6
ESTIMATED FIRST-ADMISSION RATES—1953-57 MIGRANT
INTAKES
78. It was pointed out in Chapter 3 that a five-year analysis could
not be taken past the 1952 migrant intake. Accordingly, it was necessary
to attempt an estimate of five-year rates for later arrivals. As in previous
chapters, the terms “ five-year ”, “ three-year ”, and “ two-year ”, applied
to rates, refer to first admissions within five, three or two years of arrival
in Australia.
79. The approach adopted was to examine three-year, and where pos-
sible, two-year rates, for the 1953, 1954 and 1955 migrant intakes, in
conjunction with the patterns of admission analysed in the previous chapter.
The aim was to discover those areas where rates have followed expected
patterns and, where they have not, to see whether or not the variations
were the result of random fluctuations.
80. Three-year rates covering the intakes 1951-54 are set out in Table
No. 8, and its companion Figure No. 4. The two earlier years were
valuable guides, since five-year rates for them were known. To aid the
investigation, Table No. 9 and Figure No. 5, showing the annual build-up
of three-year rates, were also prepared.
81. Three features of the male three-year rates deserve comment —
(a) Figure No. 4 shows that for the 1953 and 1954 intakes, the
maximum male five-year rate could be expected among the
20- to 29-year group. This confirmed the pattern established
in 1952, and for previous years when displaced persons were
excluded from the analysis.
(b) It will be noticed that wide fluctuations occurred in the rates
for the 50- to 59-year group. These fluctuations can be
dismissed as chance variations, because of the small number
of cases, and the relative unimportance of this age-group in
migrant intakes.
(c) The rates for the 30- to 39-year group, starting from 1951,
were 3.2, 2.9, 2.8 and lastly 1.4 per 1,000 in 1954. While
the gradual fall in these rates was to be expected, being part
of the effect of the ending of the displaced person pro-
gramme, the sudden drop between 1953 and 1954 was not.
82. With reference to (c) above, it was interesting to note that, at the
two-ye||c stage, a somewhat similar situation was apparently developing
among £e 1953 group, but admissions during the third year of residence
carried £e rate to a level largely comparable with earlier years.
83. To seek further information the 1955 two-year rates were examined
as set oilt in Table No. 10. The 1955 rate for this age group equalled
the mean two-year rate over 1952-55.
84. Hence the 1954 three-year rate for the 30- to 39-year group could
not be regarded as a sign of an important new trend, but was the result
of a chance variation from the very regular pattern of rates observed at
two-, three-, and five-year stages.


85. The analysis of year-by-year rates in the previous chapter revealed
that, while male rates maintained a firm pattern, female rates were less
regular. Rather less reliance can therefore be placed on year-by-year trends
in female rates than is possible with male rates.
86. Table No. 8 reveals that female three-year rates for the 40- to 49-year
group from migrants who arrived in 1951 and 1952 varied widely from the
1951-54 average three-year rates. The examination in Chapter 4 of the
high five-year rate in this age-group from among migrants who arrived in
1951 led to the conclusion that, because of the relatively small number of
cases involved, too much should not be made of this variation. A similar
caution should be exercised in interpreting the very low three-year rate for
1952, which in part reflects the low level of five-year rates for that year’s
intake, as demonstrated in Figure No. 2.
87. It was apparent that a fair degree of rate stability had been reached,
and that the probable five-year patterns, particularly for males, could reason-
ably be predicted. Data from the previous chapter on year-by-year patterns
was applied to the three-year rates for 1953-54 and the two-year male rates
for 1955. The result is shown in Table No. 11. To emphasize that these
figures are estimates, rates have been rounded.
88. With male rates, it was expected that the non-symmetrical pattern
would be repeated, with the maximum level reached among the 20- to
29-year group. On the other hand, female rates could not be predicted with
the same degree of confidence. Table No. 11 shows that maximum female
rates were estimated for the 30- to 49-year groups. In making the estimates,
reliance was placed on the reasonable degree of symmetry attained by the
end of the five-year period, as shown in Figure No. 2.
89. It will be observed that the estimated five-year rates for 1953-57
compare satisfactorily with actual rates for previous years, implying that a
stable rate had been established, for other than displaced persons or refugees.


CHAPTER 7
MIGRANT AND NON-MIGRANT INCIDENCE RATES
90. Before overall differences in rates between migrant and non-migrant
first-admissions were considered, certain factors were examined affecting
admissions to mental institutions which may have operated in varying degrees
on the two groups. This provided a useful background to the comparison
of migrant and non-migrant patterns,
91. The influence of age and sex on migrant rates has been seen through-
out this survey. It was interesting to contrast the patterns of these rates
with the findings of oversea studies of native-born first-admissions, which
show a continuing rise in rates with increasing age.
92. The age-structure of the post-war migrant intake has differed sig-
nificantly from the age-structure of the Australian population at the Census
of 1947, taken before large-scale immigration had begun. Obviously, allow-
ance must be made for this.
93. There is reason to believe that a number of social features could
cause differences in admission rates between migrants and native-born
persons.
94. In the native-born community, mental illness is in some cases treated
at home. Those migrants, and in particular single persons, who are far from
friends and relatives, have less opportunities for home care, and thus may
be more likely to be admitted to an institution. This may be offset to some
extent among other migrants by strong family ties.
95. For non-British migrants, the task of adjusting themselves to their
new environment is complicated by language difficulties. Inability to com-
municate can foster a feeling of isolation, and could prevent a migrant from
discussing his problems adequately with a doctor.
96. On the other hand, the comprehensive system of initial accommoda-
tion, job placement and social services, for which Australia is noted, is an
important factor in aiding migrants to overcome initial problems of
settlement.
97. Some overseas investigators have found evidence that rates of admis-
sion are affected by distance from an institution; thus rural rates will tend
to be lower than urban rates. The 1954 census revealed that migrants
were slightly more urbanized (83 per cent.) than Australian-born persons
(78 per cent.), and this could produce a tendency toward higher rates of
admission for migrants.
98. In summary, there was some reason to believe that certain factors
affecting the rates of admission to mental institutions operate more against
migrants than native-born. This was offset by the youthful structure of the
migrant population, and a thorough system of selection and screening of
migrants.
99. Age-specific first-admission rates for Australia are not available from
health statistics, nor from census data. It was not possible, therefore, to
attempt a direct comparison of migrant and nation-wide Australian rates.


100. First-admission rates were discussed by Dr. Alan Stoller, Chief
Clinical Officer of the Victorian Mental Hygiene Authority, in a recent
article (1958). He stated that some years ago, in western communities,
the annual rate of first-admissions to mental hospitals was some 0.7 per 1,000
population.
101. It was decided to check Australian migrant rates against the first-
admission figure quoted by Stoller. Annual average weighted rates for
migrants were calculated. Table No. 12 shows that the annual average rate
covering those who arrived in the years 1948-52 was 0.70 per 1,000.
102. As the rate reached among displaced persons was higher than that
for all other migrants, Table No. 13 excludes displaced persons and the
resulting annual average rate was 0.46 per 1,000. The estimated rates for
the 1953-57 migrant intakes would provide a similar annual weighted rate.
103. As the migrant group was carefully selected overseas and was
younger than the Australian population, a rate lower than 0.70 per 1,000
might be expected. In fact, it was shown to be 0.46 per 1,000.
104. To take the analysis another step, an annual rate was calculated,
standardized to the age distribution of the Australian population at the 1947
census. Age-standardization has been used by United States investigators,
who sought to present migrant admissions in the fairest manner possible, by
calculating weighted rates as if the migrants’ age distribution matched that
of the native-born population. The age-standardized annual first-admission
rate from the 1948-52 intakes (excluding displaced persons) was 0.38 per
1,000.
105. In the absence of comprehensive Australian first-admission statis-
tics, it was considered that the differences in rates between migrant and non-
migrant communities could be more easily compared if rates for a similar
native-born population to that of Australia were examined. In this way it
could be established how the pattern of first-admission rates for a similar
native-born community differs from that of Australia’s migrant intake.
106. Malzberg’s (1955) excellent first-admission statistics from New
York State were employed for this purpose. Table No. 14, and its com-
panion Figure No. 6, show New York State five-year rates corrected for
purposes of comparison with migrant rates in Australia. The rates can be
seen to have risen sharply to the 20- to 29-year group, thence more gently
until the 40- to 49-year group. Thereafter, the rates again increased markedly.
It was interesting to note that female rates remained less than similar male
rates until the 40- to 49-year group was reached. In spite of the radically
different patterns, this relationship applied both to migrants in Australia and
for native-born residents of New York State.
107. The Committee’s findings may be contrasted with the well-known
study by Malzberg and Lee (1956), in which rates for oversea-bom persons
in New York State, 1939-41, with less than five years residence, were found
to be significantly higher than those for native-born residents. Two factors
may well account for this widely differing result.


108. Firstly, the period selected for the New York study, while largely
dictated by the availability of data from the 1940 Census, included an eco-
nomic recession and an influx of refugees from persecution and war in
Europe. Secondly, Australia has moved increasingly toward family migra-
tion, while the United States intake during the ’thirties contained few
children, being largely confined to adults aged 20 to 40 years.
109. Accordingly, it was established that if displaced-person rates were
eliminated from the pattern, Australian migrant rates from each annual
intake could be accepted as being below those of a typical Western
community.


CHAPTER 8
OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST
Period in Hospital
110. Migrants in the 1948-52 intakes, admitted to a mental hospital
for the first time within five years of arrival, totalled 1,601 males and 715
females. Of these, 946 male patients (59 per cent.) and 502 females (70
per cent.) had been discharged after first admission by 31st December, 1957.
(a) Of the male cases discharged after first admission—
-42 per cent, remained in hospital less than 3 months;
73 per cent, remained in hospital less than 12 months.
(b) Of female cases discharged after first admission —
42 per cent, remained in hospital less than 3 months;
66 per cent, remained in hospital less than 12 months.
(c) Both males and females, discharged after first admission,
recorded an average stay of nine months.
111. Among the male 20- to 29-year group, 75 per cent, remained in
hospital less than 12 months, compared to 73 per cent, for the 30- to 39-year
group, and 71 per cent, for the 40- to 49-year group.
112. Among the female 20- to 29-year group, 67 per cent, remained in
hospital less than 12 months, compared to 69 per cent, for the 30- to 39-year
group, and 60 per cent, for the 40- to 49-year group.
113. In addition, both age and sex seemed to have an influence on the
chances of being admitted for a second time, as Table No. 15 reveals.
Female re-admission rates were below those for males.
Marital Status
114. While the marital status of migrants on admission to mental
institutions was known, it was not possible to obtain data on the marital
status of the whole migrant population in Australia.
115. However, a comparison of the marital status of migrants on
arrival in Australia with that upon admission showed that, among all male
migrants first admitted to a mental institution between 1946 and 1957, 70
per cent, were single, and 27 per cent, were married. Among male long-
term and permanent arrivals in the same period, 62 per cent, were single,
and 37 per cent, were married. For females, the first-admission figures for
the period show 21 per cent, were single, and 68 per cent, married; among
long-term and permanent arrivals, 51 per cent, were single, and 44 per cent,
married.
116. From these figures it can be seen that, compared with their per-
centages of the migrant intakes, more single than married males, and more
married than single females, tended to be admitted to institutions. For
females, a possible explanation is that many married shortly after arrival in
Australia, and thus the proportions of single and married among admissions
was a more accurate indication of the marital status of the female migrant
community than figures based on arrival statistics.


Deportation and Repatriation
117. Both the Immigration Act 1901-1949 and the Migration Act 1958
gave the Minister for Immigration the power to order the deportation of an
immigrant from Australia if, within five years after any entry by him into
Australia, he becomes an inmate of a mental hospital or public charitable
institution.
118. A number of migrants, following their admission to a mental
hospital, have been deported under this power, while others have been
repatriated.
119. In 1956 a Committee of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory
Council was established to review policy in this respect. After studying the
views of State Governments and the Commonwealth Department of Health,
the Committee recommended that the Commonwealth should retain the
power to deport, but that, as a matter of policy, deportation should only be
effected where the disability had existed before arrival in Australia, and
where the existence of the disability had been knowingly concealed.
120. The recommendation was accepted by the Minister, who added a
provision that, where it was clearly in the best interests of the migrant,
deportation could be effected. This recognizes that some patients may
improve in the familiar environment of their homeland, and in the care of
relatives and friends,
121. The policy, in the opinion of this Committee, is both humane and
an adequate safeguard of Australia’s interests. A stricter policy does not
appear to be required, and could possibly achieve an undesirable effect if
mentally-ill migrants were induced to conceal their condition through fear
of deportation.
