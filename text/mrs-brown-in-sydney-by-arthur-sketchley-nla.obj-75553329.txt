MRS. BROWN IN SYDNEY.
When fust Brown menshuned goin to Sydney he wished me to
stop behind with friends a little while in New Zealin thro? a eavy
cold and im being in a urry, so I says I am your lorful wife as
nothink shant separate us from tho? of course if its only a boat?s
length, as the saying is, I dont mind a stopping behind, as were
jest a fortnight and tho? I did part with my friends with a eayy
art for you don?t find friends every wheres, as put me aboard the
steamer with many a good bye as went from the key, as they
calls it, tho goodness knows why escept it is to match them locus
as they as in the rivers for to perwent the water a breakin into
the banks. I stepped aboard quite easy and I must say as I
never were aboa- d a nicer wessel than that there Eodernuntater
as they calls it, arter some river, as runs into the sea and goes at
at a wonderful rate tho give to rolling at times as is the fault of
them billers as sets everythink a rolling too. 4-S soon as ever
we got aboard I see old faces all round me as we?d trave/led
with afore, so were glad to meet again thro? anyone as you ave
met afore seemin like a old friend so far from your ome, as is
solingtary work a travelling about alone as is why some parties


takes and marries jest for company as is risky work cos theres
a many as is travellers on the look out specially widders as
knows their ways about and now an then you?ll meet a young
fieldmale as looks as if butter would?nt melt in er mouth as
the saying is she?s a arphin on the look out for a good sitivation
as governess as is ow old Potter got cort in Mclbung a old flat
as were sixty-five and took and married a gal under nineteen as
he met in the train as were?nt no more a guverness than me
tho? she governed im and a nice life she led im aboard the
steamer an was as jealous as a blacky more, and would set a
rolling is eyes all over the table at meals if she asked anyone to
pass the salt or and er the taters, as told me with tears in is eyes
as he w�r� drove to it thro? bein that lonesome a travellin in the
patent wheel grease line and I do pity them commershuls as is
always on the tramp poor fellers for years together, as must be
nothink but the same ground over and over again specially with
trade that bad with parties a bustin up all over the place and
there was one party as ad got is ole stock in trade along with im
as was everythink from pipes to preambulators, with cut glass,
and lectro plate enuf to fill a ole room at the Otel, but bless you
dursnt sell a toothpick without the money as he could?nt get.
Commershuls aint wot they used to be when I were young as
Ive knowed em myself a comin into a ouse a ordering things
as orty as Hemperors, avin of them bedrooms kep for em jest the
same as their own buggies, as they went about in a like lords
tho? only payin arf prices at the Otels, where they ad settinroom
to theirselves as nobody did?nt dare to look into not to say set
foot in without their leaf and as to the chair man as went round


regular like in a circus is word were law, tho? only a payin nine
pence for is tea with heggs, or cold meat, or it might be a ot
chop as Brown were always put up along with on is travels at
knows wot comfort is, thro? avin of a ome as none could?nt turn
up their noses at, tho? I say it myself, not as I means to say as
wot is comfort to one party is so to everyone, for plain omely
folks would consider things comforts as would?nt be no comforts
to a lord, cos its all what you?re brort up to as you considers
comforts and thats ow it is as lords cant make lore for the poor
man any more than them good ladies cant go into poor people?s
places and teach em ow to manidge their children or their omes,
as dont care to ave that interference, as is no doubt well meant,
cos a lady says Oh! you did onght to do this and you did?nt
ought to do that, not a knowin of poor woman?s ways, and goins
on, as is wot a poor person likes tho? it may seem worry uncom-
fortable to ladies and gentlemen so they d better let the poor
alone with their adwice cos they can?t settle things for the poor
any more than poor people could settle anythink for lords and
ladies. All as I says is that if things is clean and decent in a
poor person?s ome any lord as is a lord as might be on is travels
would only be too thankful to ave em, cos in course they wouldnt
espect to find fallals and made dishes at a workman?s table, any
more than a workman would care to ave is dinner off silver with
a flunkie a standing round a watching hevery bit as you puts into
your mouth, and a ketching away your plate afore your arf done
the same as them meals aboard them steamers is a wonderful lot
of dishes but too much urry for me cos for my part I perfers one
pr two things as is good and then I?ve made my dinner and dont


oare for lots of ontrays and them things on the tables as the
worry names on regularly puzzles you wat to take, and parties
all a urryin with their meals and a gobblin down anythink as is
nice for fear as they should?nt ave another elp afore its gone, and
them stewards as is often worked off their legs and obligated to
Some a whippin away the dishes and plates too afore you?ve arf
done, as is werry confusin not to say haggravatin, and am one
myself as considers steak and onions too much of a good thing
for breakfast, and dont fancy tripe, nor yet liver and bacon as is
better for dinner or supper, as dont seem to settle down comfor-
table on tea or coffee, as is only slops arter all as dont mix well
with wittles. No give me my dinner beer which is always
a pint tho? arf a pint at supper with a drop of something
ot the last thing, and then 111 sleep with a infant in a cradle
without a rocking, not but wot rockin at sea keeps me awake and
I?m sure my berth were that narrer that when once I wedged
myself in no shipwreck in this world would?nt never get me out
not even if struck on a rock and as to sandbanks I don?t believe
there?s one afloat as would wake me when once I?d got hoff as
is the way with a many, cos there were a party aboard as did
used to sing about bein rocked in the cradle of the deep, not as
anyone would think of puttin a infant in the cradle to rock itself
asleep out at sea tho? I?ve eard of some wretches as would drown
their children as in my opinion did ought to be burnt.
We ad werry pleasant parties aboard as one on em were a astro-
loger as wore spectikles and could read the stars as is like the
gipsies as knows em all by name ever so far off, and could tell ow
long you was agoin to live, if he only knowed wot the planit were


as you was born under as tho? some is born in the day time as
eould?nt be under no stars as aint wisible to the nakid beye
escept from the bottom of a well where they shine by
daylight as aint a place as any one would be likely to
come to be born down so as that in the world,
tho? I?m sure the old of a ship is low enuf, but lor
some children will thrive anywheres tho? brought up by a
donkey or even a goat or condensed milk as is often a better
mother than a nasty idle waggerbone as is give to the bottle
and didn?t never ought to ave been a mother. I must say as I
never give a thort about Orkland being such a way from Sydney
as to run short of coals, and give me quite a turn to hear we ad
to stop on the way for to take ?em in, as were a nice dirty job
for them poor sailors, tho? the captin give orders as they wasn?t
to kick up no dust over it. I were up likely early purl the
morning as we come into Sydney as certainly were a noble sight
as ave got the noblest sea in the world all round it as parties
lives a lookin over, as for that you might live anywheres in such
lovely weather as they call winter as is only their fun cos they
aint get no real winter so are obliged to make believe as there s
one, as aint as bad as their goins on in Melbung where I was at
Christmas the werry ottest time with cold turkey and plum puddin
as would have been my death if I ad?nt took a little somethink
of afore goin to bed, as it was lad orful wishuns all night, a-
dreamin? of being carried up in a dust storm and then as I was
shet up in the ovin as I?d put myself into instead of the mince
pies, as were all thro? me a forgettin where I were, and a goin
to bed under three blankets besides my railway rugs. Whyever


they called it Sydney goodness knows tho? I well remember
Sydney?s alley as runs from Coventry Street into Lester Square
as my grandmother always called Lester Fields, as did used to
be a Pallis and remembers well a seeing Miss Linwood?s wusted
work as were showed there, as were David in the Lion?s Den
and Lady Jane Gray a refusin to be a Protestant tho? Queen
Lizzybeth went down on er knee s to er as wished as she?d never
learn to write a feelin as she were doin rong in orderin of er own
usbins ead to be cut off tho? she were only Queen a week cos he
wouldn?t sent er back er weddin ring as she didn?t never ought
to have took off. But as I were a saying Sydney is a lovely
place whichever way you looks at it, and when fust I see it it give
me quite a turn for seein of a noble doom thro? the smoke I
thort as we?d been and turned back to London and that it were
St. Paul?s as ad been converted into the Exybishun so felt at ome
at once. Some says as Melbung ave the pull over Sydney,
as I don?t see cos except for the ills, I should say, give me
Sydney as looks like ome sweet ome so stepped ashore with a light
art specially as there was Brown there to meet me as went on
afore, and when I see im and wot with the place a lookin so
like dear old England X were that overcome as I busted into
tears, as Brown soon stopped with a kind word as is a way as
he?ve got for tho? some calls im a edgeog he?s got a art to melt
like butter afore the sun and ad got a real comfortable ome for
me with a party as were a widder but couldn?t ave us for a week
along of avin the painters as ad come out ere many a year ago
along with a usband as were a runaway match as went off like a
reglar fusee in the night on is own box, and took ern too, and


left er without a rag to er back but wot she she stood up in and
even took the childrens things a mean willin, as she done better
without and brort up her family well on boarders as she took in
married her three dorters as she showed me their fottygrafts as
she considered beauties but was as plain eaded as you d see in a
day?s walk but then no fottygraft don?t never show the mind as
is everythink arter all and I never did feel more at ome than
walkin out in Sydney as reminded me of Bayswater and wot I
liked best was a meetin parties in the street, as we?d travelled
with as was always that friendly in their ways tho? I must
say as some was too forward for I were dreadful put out the
day after I got there thro? awaitin for Brown as had gone
to see about our places thro? im a wishing to go on
overland to Melbung. Well I was standin by a doorway in
George Street when a party comes up he says Hallo Mrs Brown,
how are you ? glad to see you safe out ere now I?m goin to shout
for you. I says shout as much as ever you pleases so as you
don?t call out my name in the opin streets. He says then I?ll do
it inside a Otel. I says don?t go a ollerin of it in at a passage
like a low lived larrikin did this mornin. He says I don?t care
where it is, but shout I will as shall be a bottle of shampain.
Indeed you wont do nothink of the sort says a great orsegod
mother of a fieldmale as were just come up. Wot do you mean
by wastin your money over sich a bloated old Bumble Bee as
this. X says my good woman I?ll trouble you to keep your
remarks to yourself for I aint no more a bumble bee than you?re
a blue bottle, and don?t want none of Hs shampain as is like is
?impidence a offering me thro? bein a perfect stranger escept by


sight at sea. She says more shame for you to ask im to shout
or you as is my usban. I says I never did. She says y 1 did
for I eard you thro a standin up next door and you said shout
away with all my art, only not in the street. I says I didn?t
know wot he meant. You?re a nice innercent she says as she
ketched old of that party by the harm as ad offered to shout fo r
me and walked im off in a jitfey a sayin to me likely as you don?t
know what shoutin means as ave been no doubt shouted for all
over the place as I can declare X never was but once when Brown
ollered up the stairs a saying as we was late for the train. So
when Brown come back he bust out a larfin and told me wot
shoutin meant as I ad eard afore the? it ad went clean out of my
ead thro? being took at a non plush, but whoever would think as
they was that hignoraut as to call standing treat shouting, as if
a thing as is mostly done on the quiet without no noise, but in
course every think is done the reverse of natur in a place where
everyone is upside down. But after that I were nervous to let
Brown out of my sight when awalkin out. We only stopped
a day or two at a Otel as the werry fust day as I
were there a gentleman as were werry sunburnt looks
at me werry ard and says I think I am addressin Mrs.
Brown as lived at Stepney. I says certingly as will never deny
it no if lad to burn my and at the slake as the saying is. Then
he says you remember me and my wife as nearly died in your
ouse when onr little gal was born as is now the mother of five
erself. I says why if it aint Captain Jopplins. He says right
you are and wont my wife be glad to see you, and so she was
for he took and drove me out in is own carridge to see er as


took and kissed me for er mother as ad lodged with me thirty
years ago, when they fust married on the sly and ad went out to
Ingier in a sailin vessel with the hahy only six weeks old, as
hadn?t nothink ardly more than wot they stood up in as ad a
outfit in the hend, and had left Injier and come to settle in
Horsetrailisr with a fine family and sick a lovely ouse as looked
all over the hay who ad made a fortune hut didn?t care to go
ome and no wonder with sich a lot of appiness round em and
made the promise as we?d come and dine along with Brown on
Sunday for he says afore all his family if it ad nt been for Mrs.
Brown ataking of us in your sister?d ave been born in the
Workus for we ad?nt no home nor money to get one. I says if you
talk like that I wont never come near you agin, not but wot it
were a foolish busyness in them two young parties amarryin
under twenty, but all?s well as ends well as the sayin is. The
werry next day went to where we was agoin to stay, and I mus
say as I were glad to get away from the Otel cos I likes a quiet
like, and they?re a talkin of buildin a fine one somewheres with
a view of the sea, not as I wanted any view of the sea for I d
been alookin at nothin else for days But aforever we went to
t he Otel Brown called in on Mrs Swelter as is where we was to
live, but till the paint were gone off as I could?nt stand on the
top of the sea, thro? a feelin that way as you do jest arter gettin
ashore not as Mrs. Swelter would ave ad us thro? wantin? a good
clean up as I were sorry for and did?nt fancy agoin to the Otel
and longed for to settle down somewheres quiet as I never can in
Otels. I must say as I were soon at ome for the moment as I
got into the cuse Mrs. Swelter says to me now I knows as you?re


used to you?re Inglish way so you have wot you likes when you
likes, as give me a real good cup of tea on the spot for I ad?nt
ad no breakfast to speak on thro? arushin upon deck to see the
openin of the arbour as why ever they calls it a arbour I can?t
make out, and nothink about it the least like a lovely one at the
bottom of our garden near Stepney Green as Brown made |that
beautiful with rock-work as is now turned into the railway
station, but whether they calls it a arbour cos of it?s bein rocks
all round I can?t say as it is a nice spot for a summer-house as is
that agreeable in ot weather and as to this ere arbour I must say
as it?s lovely. When Mrs. Swelter she eard as I come from
Stepney as is were she did used to live with a aunt by the
mothers side as brort er up by the bottle from the month as
were left a orfin thro? the milk aflyin to her ead, she quite took
to me like a sister tho? a good seven years older, not as I?m
ashamed of my hage like Miss Pilkinton as will never see fifty
ho more in this world and talks about eight and thirty and
pertends as she can?t call to mind when lucifers fust come in as
took the place of the tinder box and a good thing too as was
that horkard for to get a light by in a urry with a flint and steel
urtin your knuckles and them brimstone matches a choking let
alone makin the tinder as were suffercatin work all over the ouse
as lucifers ave been and nocked out of time. I must say as
that Otel as we went to were werry pleasant but too much urry
skurry for me, as dont care about settin down to my meals with
so many as makes it a scramble not but there was a nice drorin
room to set in and a beautiful verander as run all along the fron*
of the ouse with a bit of grass and poll parrots in front as looked


nice and green and kep a chatterin and a screaxnin all day as
made it werry cheerful partikler with parties a settin out and
chattin friendly and some singin and playin lovely on the pianer
partikler one young lady who wowed and declared at fust as she
couldn?t sing and then took and done it lovely when pressed by
some young gents, as shows as theres some parties all over the
world as will say anything but their prayers and then they
whistles as the saying is the same as a party as ad been astoppin
at the Otel two days afore me as I thort as I knowed er by sight
some ow a settin in the werrander tho? a good deal changed
since I?d set eyes on er every way, but I says to myself I?ll not be
the fust to make no advances, but asked the lady of the ouse as
said she were a rich Mhrrykin widder as is goin to marry a
wealthy squatter. I says, Oh indeed she looks like one for
she were dress in sky blue. So I kep a thinkin as I couldn?t be
rong about that field male as ad lived along with me and then
married a cousin of mine as ad lewanted and left er many
a year afore a mean speritted ound, as she were better
without as led er a dogs? life so ad to go to service, but did nt take
no notice till I could see her alone and the werry next day the
fust person as I see in the werander were Susan that party as ad
lived with us in the Bow Eoad, dressed out as fine as a orse with
er air done yaller in a train, so I says, Ah! Susan ow do you
do? She says you?re mistook my name is Madam Montebanco.
I says rubbish you?re Susan Ashcroft as lived along with me
twenty years ago. She screams out never. I says Oh! yes you
did that time as the flue bio wed up, and your own mothers sister
as brort you up were nearly drownded in the copper as she were


a angin over with going to bile them eavy sheets of mine. She
says nothing of the sort. I was never in Ingland. I says
Pickles, you was born in Stepney workus do you think as I?m as
blind as that mole as you?ve got on your neck as I could swear
to you by, let alone avin your front tooth broke as you did a
pullin out a bodkin but I says my good soul if you don?t want to
know me I?m sure I dont want to remind you of things as ain?t
no profit to me nor yet pleasant to you, and you need?nt be afraid
of me alettin the cat out of the bag as the sayin is for I?m as
dumb as any waiter and I walks into the ouse avin eard as she?d
been in a luncheon bar at Liverpool as she were a sort of a ouse-
keeper at, tho? kep by a single man as don?t look well tho? it
may be all on the square as the sayin is, and in course no
business of mine but she were a fool to pretend not to know me
as ad better ave made a friend on me, tho? I?m sure I shan?t be
a foe. In course I knowed er from an infant, and that poor as
er mother would come and borrow a few coals and a shillin as
she?d take ome in the tail of her gownd, but did nt want to say
nothink about er as ad worn well thro bein one of them scraggy
figgers as passes for gals to past forty, partikler with er ead done
with Mrs. Allin?s world wide air restorer and her complexion all
that magnolier water with er ole figger squeezed into a gownd as
tight as a bolster case and a train as reached yards, but in course
I did?nt want to say nothink agin the poor thing only er inci-
dence this did put me out, cos if she?d been and bettered erself
why not own it and I should have been glad and wished her joy
on makin a good match, but she were not satisfied with hignorin
of me, but must jine with nothers in rediculin me as I eard em


with my own ears asettin out in that werander, not athinkin 1
were asettin in the room close agin the winder and eard er a
speakin of me bein that fat as I were an objec, and says to the
lady of the ouse as she wondered as she could ave sich parties in
er ouse, as answered er that proper asayin as long as parties was
rsspectable and heaved theirselves she were glad to ave em, and
reglar spoke up for me, but as to that other fieldmale that
Susan says Oh! I?ve got nothing to say agin er character. I
says to myself that?s preaps more than I could say of you my
lady. Says the lady of the ouse, I likes to ear er talk she
reminds me of a old nurse as I knowed, so the other says Ah I
I never mix with them lower orders. So I thinks to myself I
wonders what is lower orders than wot you?ve been obliged to
obey. I did?nt say a word and werry soon arter went up to bed
and ad?nt been in my room above a minit or two when there
come a tap at the door and who should come in but Susan in er
dressin gownd. Oh ! she says dear Mrs. Brown do forgive me
but I?ve got a game to play as if I loses is ruinashun. Well I
says that aint nothink new for you. Oh! she says you dear
good soul I know you?ll be my friend and not let out anythink
about me as were obligated to seem never to ave eard on you
for fear as you might ave let anythink drop about me. I says
then you might have tipped me a wink as is the thing as you?ve
done afore now and I says I ain?t menshuned a word to a soul
thro? avin no one to speak to as my good gentleman as you well
remembers ave gone up the country for a day or two so I says
lets? shake ands and say no more about it and am glad as you?re
agoin to ear as a rich, man is agbin to marry you. She says yes.


and that?s why I do ope as you?ll keep dark about me. I says
I suppose as you knows as Joe as were er fust usbans name is
dead. She give a sigh asaying as she loved im once and then
took and kissed me and wished me good night. I were glad as
she?d come and spoke out like hat tho? I thinks to myself
you?re up to your old games as were always a reglar mask of
deceit. It happened as two days arter that I see er asettin in
the werander with a red face party as the lady of the ouse
told me were her intended. So I did?nt say nothink not a pre-
tending to see er, but set a listenin to some musishuners as was
a playin werry beautiful before the otel and one on em come
up for to ask us to encourage the performance and I give
im a thrippenny bit. He says thank you noble lady in a
voice as made me start, but I did?at say nothink thro?
a knowin as he were Joe Ashcroft my own cousin and
that there Susan?s lawful husband for they was married
from my ouse. I thought I should have dropped out of my seat
as he says to me in a low voice, don?t be afeared I shan?t disgrace
you I did?nt know wot to say only a thinkin about Susan, as I
thought I?d speak to on the quiet and a opin as he would?nt see
er in the dark, but as ill luck would have it just as he got up to
er that squatter as were a settin by her side took and lighted up
a fusee as in course throwed a new light on er. I eard er give a
cream but did?nt move, not even when I heard her say, Go
away you willin I never saw you before in my life and see that
squatter collar im as he says, Never see me; why you?re my wife
and here?s a witness close by as can prove ii. That squatter
dropped into his seat agin as if shot thro? the art and Joe oilers


out to me Mrs. Brown you please for to come here and indemnify
me as am your own flesh and blood by the mothers side tho
once removed. I says I can?t deny as your mother were my
mothers fust cousin tho? I thought you was dead. Well that
poor creetur Susan ad fell back dead faint like but jumps up at
them words and says to me did?nt you tell me he was dead last
night and your words was I suppose you know as Joe is dead
I see as she?d been and mistook my meaning, but did?nt say a
word and says to er well you?d better settle it atween you, she
says, Yes, that?ll be best in the mornin so off we went and as
there was?nt anyone else on the verander we was able to keep it
dark that night so went to bed, but bless you Susan were a deaj
too sharp for any of us for she got away from the Otel that
werry night and there was?nt no trace of er in the mornin and
that squatter he went off alone by steamer next day as were
agoin to Frisco as they calls it, and I were not sorry to leave
that Otel cos I likes quiet and ow that young lady can manidge it
all by erself as is that genteel and never ear her woice but rules
all them waiters and servants like a rod of iron and the way as
she keeps all them books is wonderful and quite the lady all the
time as only shows as getting of your livin onestly dont make
you a bit the less of a lady nor yet your clothes set the worst on
your back.
Tho? that Otel werry cheerful T wore not sorry to
hear that Mrs. Swelter?s paint were dry and the smell gone off
so went there and got a bedroom on ih@ ground floor as suits me
better than stairs and Brown he was reglar comfortable tho? he
was never much at ome thro? a goin about to see all them railways


partiklar one as goes up a steep ill as they calls a gradjent, as is
things I dont care for cos I?m reglar sick of them improvements
as is always a cropping up one on the top of the nother and
there?s no tellin wot they?ll come to a upsetting everythink in
turn from time to time the same as stage coaches was by railroads?
as now lectricity will be down upon, and run steam off the roads
no doubts also by sea as will be a great blessin to get through
the water quicker for I do ate a sea woyage with nothink to turn
to but wittles and sea sickness all the time, and do ope to see the
day when you?ll go that fast as you wont care for neither least-
way, wont have no time to be ill tho? I must say as arf a our at
sea, seems sometimes a hage, a wishin yourself out of the world
with them terrors on you as the saying is thro? bein one minit
afeard as you was a goin to die, and the next being afeard as
you was?nt, cos life ain?t worth avin at the price, and as to wittles
the werry thort on em is worse than dissylution. Brown he?s
all agog as the sayin is over these ere improvements jest as if he
were a young feller and it certainly is wonderful wot I eard im
and a party as is in the ingineerin line atalkin about as was
makin steamers go that fast as they?d get ahead of the waves
and think nothink of fifty knots a our, as is somethink like goin of
it by steam ; not as I?m ever surprised at anythink as appears
now a days a well rememberin the time as parties said as no
steamers could?nt never cross the Oshun, and as no railway
aould?nt go quicker than ten miles a our and as to my dear
mother she would?nt ave gas in the place a sajdng as it would
esplode the same as she?d eard say as it would tear up the pavin
stones of the streets and set London all in a blaze, as I?d rather


myself have near me any day than parafeen as is that easy
knocked over, as is how that gal of ourn were worry nigh
reduced to a firery grave thro? readin the Family Erald in bod
with the lamp a standin on some hooks as she?d been and piled
up on a chair by the bedside, as I went in, and ketched er jest
as shead knocked it over thro? afailin asleep with er elber as
would?nt take no wornin tho? I give her the sack in the mornin
and went to live with Jews as she nearly burnt the ole family
the same as they did used to be as Miss Pelkinton were a tellia
me in them middle hages as I considers to be anyones prime as
is ealthy and takes care of theirselves as some never wont do at
no hage no yet sect neither for I?ve knowed young wornin take
to drink like water, as ends bad and so it were with Mrs.
Swelters son?s wife os she told me were cured by avin sich a dose
as er usban giver of tarter emetic in rum and water, as preshus
nigh killed er, and the werry smell of sperrits ever arter,
made er wuss than a sea woyage or a stomick pump broke loose
as ave saved many a life without no pison for I remembers
werry well many years ago Mrs. Welsher afailin off er own cart
atakin ome the linen one Friday evenin close agin Igh Park
corner so were carried into St. George?s Ospital close by a reglar
stunner as me and my mother went to see on the Sunday next as
ever was and see er alayin in wot they calls a catomouse state
and asinkin fast. As soon as mother see er she says can?t she
take nothink, lor bless your art says the nuss she can?t swaller
not even this beef tea poor dear. There were a young doctor
a passin by as looks at her and says, Ow are you tried to get it
down. Why with a spoon in course says the nuss Bother your


spoons says the young man so off tie went for a stomick pum
and soon put the beef tea down as kep there and in three weeks
she were astandin aoverlookin the women at her own wash tub
cos in course as that doctor said cos she?d hurt er �ad that was nf
no reason as her stomick should?nt be kep agoin as in course
brought the life back into er. I eertingly were werry com-
fortable along with Mrs. Swelter as had only one or two boarders
and only one gal who did lots of work and not a bad sort tho
cheeky as is the way with amany Colonials as is all thro? bein
young as will learn better as they gets on but as to them
lari kins as they calls em they are downright owdashus as will
drive you out of the way like young bullocks, but wot put me
out one day awalkin along the street was the way they war all
abullyin a poor Chinee as eertingly were a ugly party let alone
a wiolent squint, and the colour of curry as a lot of these ere
boys were ateasin and a throwing mud at and a comin and
afetchin im kicks serreptishus behind, so he run up to me for
perteeshun, for tho? I?m agin Freetrade X ates bullies so I takes
and turns on them young willins a give a sweep round with my
umbrella, as ketched the poor Chinee in the chest and doubled
im up, he give a orful owl tho? he did?nt mind aknowin as I
meant well and I says to them boys as were ajeerin and alarfin,
get out you j oung willins as did ought to be thankful as you
was?nt born with pig tails yourselves and not go a ill treatin
poor hignorant forriner as is its aperient as did?nt make isself
any more than you could?nt make tea without im. I says you
dare lay a finger on im, and see ow I?ll serve you tho? he is
poor yaller wretch. All them boys busts out alarfin and I looks


round and there were that Chinee ashakin his fists at me and
says, Go-you-old cow me no hignorant, me no poor retch, No-you
cow?fat cow?pig. I says you?re a insultin ungrateful wagger-
hone and I?ve a mind to set the hoys on to you. Jest then a
perlicemen come up and says to me You dare to and I?ll get
you free lodgins for many a week to come, hfow then you boys
stop it but law they did?nt stop for him to speak but lewanted
the same as the Chinee, and that there perliceman did?nt listed
to me but was awalkin on asayin its disgraceful for a old woman
like you to encourage them boys as is quite bad enuf without
avin their grandmothers to elp em, I were that took aback as I
staggered to the wall. Ah! he says aturnin away what a cuss
drink is. I says young man if you?re illudin to me as drunk
you are making of a herror as you?ll repent on for tho? one as
can take my nutriment I defy anyone to say as I?m give to
lickerin up as the sayin is. He did?nt make no answer but kep
on a follerin on me for I was agoin up ill as I considers
ills to be Sydney?s drawbacks. When I got to Mrs. Swelters
door I see that Bobby still a follerin me at a distance, and when
the gal went out for a herrant he took and asked her if I were
mad or drunk for he?d ketehed me in streets awaltzin with a
Chinee and a lot of boys round me. I wished as I?d took is
number as I?d complain to the Govinor as is just the same as
Queen Wictorier as sent im out ere thro? not bein able to be
everywhere so is obligated to send them wices to represent er
all over the place, not as she ?ae got any wices of er own as is a
model of wirtues, as the sayin is whether ome or abroad and
talkin of rulin wices if that Old Grladstin don?t mind is eye, and


does anything for to annoy er now as she took im hack agin
there ain?t a man in Old Ingland or the Colonies as wont be
down on im, tho? he ave got Brandlors and all that lot at his
back, and as to is taking the dooty off them rubbishin french
wines as is is faverite drink and as I considers no better than
winegar as he looks as if he lived upon for of all tho winegar
wisages as ever I did see he?s tho sourest and I dont old with
taking back any servint as you?ve give the sack to and never
did it but once myself as was a gal as I pitied as made me rue
the day as ever she darkened my doors, but as Brown says Queen
Wictorier oould?nt elp it thro? bein the british Constitution ail
as I can say is I wishes er a better. But bless your art thats
the best of being out ere as you aint worreted to death over
wot they?re a doin in London any more than parties in London
cares about wot goes on out ere and if I could give Queen
Wictorier a lot of my mind I?d say May it please your Majisty
jest give all them parties in Ingland the slip and take a tower
all round your colonials as is where the sun never sets as would
be glad to see you with a heorty welcome all over the world and
ave royal Tallises everywhere and then could reglar dodge the
weather and ave no more colds in your royal ead and drop in to
see your friends, cos in course that Old Gladstin thinks as he can
manage everythink is own way so let im try and a nice mess
he?ll make on it agin, with all is stumpin and speechafyin, as I
did?nt think would ave took in the Scotch ro easy, not as they?ll
trust im any further than they can see im a old fox for all is
fine talkin, enuf to drive Queen Wictorier out of her wits, as
might come ere in welcome and ave that there Exhibishun


Buildin turned into a Pallis for er, tho? it would be livin in glass
ouses as is places as you must?nt throw stones as the sayin is.
But I must say as the Ills is tryin in Sydney and why ever they
dont make wire ducks like Obun I can?t think for my breath is
that dreadful bad sometimes of a night in only gettin up to
where we?ve been astayin that I ketches old of the posts or
anythink as is passin for to steady myself as led to things bein
unpleasant the other evenin close agin that Windward Square
as reglar winded me a comin up from George Street and give
me a stitch in the side that suddin as I staggered agin and
ketched old of a gent as were apassin to save myself from fallin
as was?nt no gentleman for he shook me off that rough as I come
full butt agin a party as were behind me and reglar squeezed er
agin a cab wheel as was standin near the kerb, as was?nt no lady
by er langwidge, not as its the ills as is fleh hair to as I minds cos
were all born in a walley, as the sayin is so must get over our
ills if we ope to get on, but the pavements is that erful bad as
I?ve come cropper once or twice even in George St. as is named
arter Old King George as did used to rain over em, but ad?nt
never a more lovelier spot to live in than the Governor ere as
ave got the flag as braved a thousin years the battle and the
breeze as the sayin is as is a flying all over tho bay as is a noble
sight with them ships alayin to, as was french and inglish side by
side as was?nt quite so friendly when t?was in Trafalgar bay as
they got a fightin yard arm to yard arm and took and killed
Lord Nelson in the harms of victory, as had only one arm to
fight with so could?nt be expected to win the day poor fellow
though I ave eard of parties playin cricket and winnin the day


with ono arm and I well remember an old willin as did used to
set a beggin on a board along the wall of White Chapel
Workus as ad?nt neither harm nor legs as he said as he?d lost at
sea, as did used to ill use his wife frightful thro? a battenn er
like a ram with is ead as only proves that where there?s a will
there?s a way as the sayin is, not that he ad a will when he died
jest arter er and left a lot of money sowed up in a mattress as
must have been er andy works as all went they say to queen
Yictorier thro? er bein the ead of the Poll as the sayin is, and
neither of them leavin a single air either side for to crop up,
and claim it. I can?t say as I cares for the busses as is that
awful joggly without no conductor to elp you in, and out nor yet
take your fare and give you change tho? parties is werry perlite
but I must say as that way of payin thro the ole puts me out
partikler if there ain?t anyone in the bus for to put your fare in
the little glass box as is just at the hend of the bus as is werry
ill convenient for anyone as ain?t active like me when alone as I
was a goin out to Wooly lara far to see a friend as I?d knowed
emigrated many years ago as ad?nt throve thro? Immigration well
when I got in the bus it were empty all except a child a oldm a
bundle I were that ot and tired as I set still a bit for to cool
myself and if that there driver did?nt keep on a dingin with that
ben till I was werry nigh mad as the child were for my fare so
I gets on to my feet thro? a oldin on to a leather strap as goes
along the roof and puts into that box a sixpence and afore I
sets down I oilers for my change thro? the little ole, the driver
says you?ve put it in. I says no I?ve put in sixpence and wants
tuppence change he says its only a four penny as you put in for


I see it. I says youre a labourin under a terror. He says let
go the strap as you?re a oldin the door by. I shall not I says
till I?ve got my change. Jest then some one agettin in gave a
violent pull at that strap as were fixed agin the door and sent
me a flyin backards, and down I set on that child as give a
scream and says Oh! my father?s tea I eard a crash. The party
as ad got in collars me a saying get up you?ll smother the gal
and give me that violent pull as I fell a rollin on the floor of
that bus and just then a fieldmale come in with a babby in er
arms, and three children as tripped over me and all the lot
pitched eadlong on the top of me thro all the children a fallin
one on the top of another and one on em ad got a jar of treacle
in er and and as she emptied all over me in fallin They stopped
the bus and a man come up and asks the little gal for his tea,
as bust out a cryin asaying as that fat old woman ad set down
on it and smashed the lot. The party with the children set to
and jined that man and pulled me out of the bus and there I
was with all my things bedaubed with treacle, and them chil-
drens muddy boots called every name as they I could lay their
tungs to and in my fall my little black bottle ad broke under
me as I'd jest ad filled thro? a goin out to see teatotalers and
being afeard as the night hair might strike to me chilly, as
made some parties as come up that rude, asayin as I were not
in a fit state for to ride in a public convenience thro? bein no
lady and the wuss for licker, as I can swear were as sober as
any judge, and so off that bus di?ove and tho I offered to indem-
nify the man for is tea, he would?nt ave it so left me on the igh
road as a where I might ave been till now only for a cab as


were a passin as took me to where I were stoppin not as I olds
with them cabs as is up to nice larks, for when we fust come the
werry day arter we landed I went out a little ways, and thro it
a gettin dark that suddin felt timber some so ails a cab for
to take me back to the otel and when I got there as nearly
jolted me to death tho? it was?nt no distance for the roads is
full of oles and I was werry nigh dislocated from side to side, let
alone the trouble in gettin in and out as the step were that igh
as I couldbat step up, nor yet git down As soon as I were out I
says to the cabby wait a bit and urries up to the door of the
case where parties was a standin all round and says to one as I
thought were a waiter pay im please, as will be a shillin. He
did?nt make no answer so I goes up to my room and you never
did see sich a gownd as mine and my welwet capo as were
daubed from ead to fut with mud as I?d got from the wheels of
that cab so only ad time to git ready for dinner as were not to
my taste as were not to my taste, thro? bein too much of the
cookin machine about it as always tastes like a ovin, and the
best thing they has is soup as did ought to be good with all the
forequarter of beef one penny a pound and the best prime jintes
only four pence so soup meat aint no object as is wot makes it good-
Well arter dinner wo went into the drorin room as there was
parties in as sung and we ad tea anded round quite genteel the
winders was opin thro? the weather bein that ot and I see a
man?s face astarin at me thro? the curtins as come once or twice
and looks in, and after a bit a waiter come as were ansome tho?
dark and says to me the cabman wants to know how much
[onger you wishes im to wait. I says me wish im to wait bless


the man I dont want im. So the waiter he went out and come
in agin a sayin as he?d been waitin for me accordin to orders
three ours as were sixteen shillin includiu of the fare. I says
the man?s mad or drunk. No he aint says the feller in at the
winder. Go away you low person says the lady of the ouse as
were asettin listenin to the music dressed that lovely as looked
quite up the nocker as the sayin is thro? bein a fine helegant
figger and a train like the royal family. He says I shan?t go
away without my money. Says the lady to the waiter send for
the perlice, I says I?ll go and speak to the man as may be a
herror. So out I goes and he says did?nt you tell me to wait.
Yes I says till I sent you out your fare as were a shillin and so I
did for I told one of the waiters to give it you Which were it says
the ead waiter a elegant party. So I looks round and see the party
as I?d spoken to aleanin agin the werander. I says there he is and
goes up to him and says my good man did?nt you pay the cab a
shilling as I told you. He says, Wot you mean me pay your
cab never of the world. Says the waiter law bless you he aint a
waiter he?s a forrin nobleman as ave come over to show isself at
the Exybishun, I says mussy on us wot ever am Ito do. Says
the cabman why give mo fifteen shillin. Well I was took aback
so I goes in and speaks to the lady of the ouse as were that kind
and tooked and got it squared for six, not but wot I believes i
were a swindle on that cabman?s part as might ave sent in before
to know if he was to wait as I eard arter were a common trick
with them cabbies as they served a minister two or three days
arter as wowed he ad?nt been in the cab at all as shows as theres
tome parties as will swear your life away and as to them cabmen


if you only takes em a few yards and gives em a shillin they?ll
snatch it from you and nearly send you a spinnin backards the
same as one did to me close agin the Town All only a party
ketched me in is harms, and says you see we dont think much
of a shillin in Sydney. I says mores the pity cos the time may
come as some of them fellers will be thankful for a penny as
is ow so many comes to die in the "Workus thro? aturnin up their
noses at onest wages and so ends in gettin neither work nor
wages. I was appy as the day?s long astoppin with Mrs.
Swelter as ad eard of me years ago and a real pleasure to be
along with as ad knowed sorrers thro? berryin throe usbans and
nine children in the bush, and would set and tell you all about
wot she?d went thro forty year ago when fust she come out and
wonderful stories about them natives as war as wil 1 as ares and
lived on nothink but roots of trees and Oysters as dont take to
their beds but angs on to the rocks as you may knock off by
the score as Mrs Swelter said as we?d make a party and go out
in a boat with bread and butter and bottled stout and ave a
reglar pic-nic. As X agreed to not as I?m fond of a open boat as
will always lean over at the side as I?m settin on. Not but wot
I relishes a oyster as well as other fishes now and then tho? not
a carin for anythink fancy in the way of wittles cos tho? a good
happy tite I likes my meals reglar and plain as always suits me
best and I do believe as plain roast and biled is best and in a
general way I thinks parties enjoys best all said, and done, tho I
dont care for hale at breakfast as some takes they do say were
Queen Lizzybeths favrit tipple as she?d take, and swaller like
beef by the yard, as is ow they sells the butter in Cambridge


to this worry day in remembrance on er. It iss certingly a
fine open sea as Sydney stands agin and no doubt there is fine
arbours to a many of them ouses as looks over tha sea as must
be a comfort for to take tea in of an evening in simmer when
they tells me as you can?t ardly draw your breath as is like a
fiery furnace, as would?nt suit me as can?t walk on the sunny
side of White Chapel road in summer and never goes out in the
eat of the day not even down at Margit as is always a cool
breeze of a evenin off the sea. I was glad we was in time for
to see the Hexy bishun buildin as were not pulled down
and looked like the ghost of St. Pauls and its a pity as
they dont turn in into a church as would be big enuf to old all
the different sexes as might meet there. We went to see one
or two old friends of Brown, and one as lives close agin Mrs.
Swelter a widder as ad?nt been left that comfortable so as to do
nothink so set to work and took in boarders as she made that
comfortable as to ave the ouse always full and so made a com-
fortable livin tho ard work with all the cookin and three meat
meals a day as nothink, as was mostly young men as ad happy-
tites to make stare agin the way as they?d lick up a fine steak
and put away mutton chops, but meat is plentiful and cheap as
I considers beef at four pence a pound prime cut, the wegetables
is scarce, and the fruit rubbish all escept oranges. Sydney is a
hold anshent place as always was head quarters like, for I well
remembers earing about a party when I were quite a child as
come out to Horsetrailier and went thro? orrers up in the bushes
as is all they ad to live in, but when she got to Sydney did well
as she set up as a dress maker in, and made a ansom vin, as


shows as �hey wore clothes all them years ago, so I seemed to
he at ome in Sydney as is a deal more like ome than Melbung
tho? it aint got such fine streets nor yet so grand not all over
tho? there?s a many of the huildins quite as fine and as to
Botanicle Gardins they?re downright lovely with a view of the
sea as is as fine as can be as you dont get a glimpse on at
Melbung. When I went over the buildin where the Exybishun
as been showed and see some of the things as ad?nt been all
took away, I says it must are been beautiful and wot I likes
about it is as it were that andy as you ad?nt to drag for miles to
get to it, nor yet be drenched to your skin in comin out a waitin
for a omblebus like Paris as nearly give me my death the year
afore last, as was too big by arf in my opinion as shows as the
Sydney people is up to a thing or two and dont go a over reach-
ing themselves like New Zealand as ave out run the cunstible as
the saying is. Wot I liked at Mrs Swelters was bein that quiet
and friendly like all together and a chattin at meals and there
was a lady as ad got a sister a livin out at North Shore as she
said I must come out to see along with er so accordin we went
one Sunday and a lovely arternoon and when we got across the
water in a steamer I says wherever do your sister live. She says up
there a pintin to sich a ill as nothing but a bird could nt settle on.
I says I never can do it, Oh! she says there?s a flight of steps as
you can take your time up. There wore a young man along
with us as lived with Mrs. Swelter. (Oh! he says Mrs. Brown
you?re not the woman to turn agin a ill, and this is only one of
them ills as flesh is air to. Oh! I says I shouldn?t mind no
ills, nor yet steps.) He?s one of them charfin dispositions as is


full of is fun, tho? worry nice behaved and always avin of a larf
with me thro? bein come out from jest afore me so we took to
one another if my flesh were as light as air but it aint as sixteen
stone aint no trifle on level ground to carry, but agoin up ill
reglar blows me and steps is as bad. But talk of bein blowed
I was werry nigh killed thro? agoin up them steps as is as igh
as the North Pole I should say, as is a mile from where we went
to drink tea. I would not have went along with that fieldmale
if I?d any consumption as she was sich double faced a wiper, as
big a one as ever drored the breath of life and all carney in er
ways and said as I reminded er of a sister as she?d lost early, as
was all gammon for she never ad no sister nor yet brother as it
turned out and did?nt know er own father thro? er mother avin
died in the poor ouse when she was born, not in course as she
could elp that but were?nt no escuse for the way as she treated
me a reglar enticin me out and a leavin me in the lurch as was
er willianous trick as she served me that Sunday eve as she took
me out. Jest as we landed it turned dusk and I?d av turned
back only she said as it were close at and where we was agoin,
so I agreed as we?d come across the water, and never in my
days did I see sich a flight of steps as we ad to get up jest like
goin up the side of a pressypitch as she did?nt feel thro? er bein
one of them close prop Aggers and kep a skippin up them steps
as lad to take my time over so at last she turns back and says
to me as ad?nt got up above a dozen steps and was arestin to
look at the view, take your time, I?ll go on fust and let em know
as you?re a comin and when you gets to the top of the steps turn
to your left and go straight on as can?t miss the ouse as is white


as shall be a looking out for you myself with a green werander
and a green tree in front. I says all right, and arter puffin, and
panting and takin my time when I did get to the top of them
steps it were pitch dark as the sayin is, and its a wonder as I
did?nt pitch all the way back agin down them steps for no goose
never turned giddier than me when I got to the top and no
breath left in my body but pants, and puffs as made me snort
like a sea orse. As to that young feller he?d gone off with some
pals as soon as we landed I never were more dead beat and it
took me ever so long to pull myself together and start off, but
however it were I turned I could?nt find the place and did?nt
known the name of the party I were goin to tea along with and
there I kep on a wanderin like any Jew all over the place and
gjch a place for to wander in without them Otels as aint no
better than pubs bein open of a Sunday, as talk about Cristshuns
ways, give me the eathen as is better than a lot of umbugs a
makin their laws to shut up all places of refreshment on a
Sunday, as they can set comfortable over their own firesides a
enjoyinof their teas, and a poor stranger be a walkin about arf
dead for the want of somethink to eat, as may be some people?s
religious but I?m thankful to say aint mine. At last I were that
dead beat as the sayin is as I took and set down on the road side
close agin a old rookery of a place, awonderin whether that could
be the place as I wanted, as were close agin where I expected to
find this ere ouse. It were quite dark, but I eard parties a
talkin with the winder open and thort as I knowed the voice as
were that party as I?d come out with as said Oh! Jem do
jest run down the road and see if you can meet that old grampus


a comin. It gave me sich a turn a knowin as she must mean
me. She says I want jou to see er, she?s such fun a reglar
wulgar old cockney beast as makes you die alaifin; but mind
you dont let er see you?re larfin at er cos she?s werry sharp, but
I?ve managed for to gammon er and means to get a nice present
out of er thro? flatterin er about er dress as she?s that prowd on�
and ave got a lot of long winded stones and you never see sich
a figger, as I ad my work cut out to persuade er to come, and
shall put er in a ole afore we gets ome and thort as I?d urry up
jest to give you the tip about er. I?d arf a mind to give er a
bit of my mind thro? the winder a deceitful ussey. Jest then a
party says Tilda aint it a bit rough on an old lady to bring her out
to make game on er. I could ave give that party a kiss for he
spoke out like a man, as proved to be a sailer for I jest peeped
in at the winder and see im and some others a settin there as
seemed to me a rowdy lot. So that fieldmale says. It serves er
right a old fool as is reglar chuck full of er wanity, but she says
shet the winder and lets ave tea for I?m sick of waitin for old
blow ard as we call er, but not afore Mrs. Swelter as is er friend
as is too slow for me so I?m a goin to cut. I did?nt ear no more
for they let down the winder jest as I drored myself back so as
they would?nt see me. I looks round and found it were the back
of the ouse as I?d come to so I goes off on the quiet a dodgin
about so as not to let that party see me as they?d sent to look for
me. lad to rest agin and agin and at last set down on the path
and did?nt ardly know were I were a goin, I was so put out by
that wile fieldmales deceit, and all as I was a thinkin about was
owever I was to get ome. Jest arter I?d been and seated myself
as
do


I see a old lady come out a door close by me and throw er tea
leaves away, as says to me aint you well, a settin on the cold
ground there* So I told er ow I were sitiwated and if that good
old soul as were the Hirish perswashun did?nt take me into er
little bit of a ouse, and make me a cup of tea and wanted me to
ave some cold wittles or would ave cooked me a bit of bacon, but
I could?nt ave touched a mouthful were it ever so, tho? the tea
did pick me up wonderful likewise a settin by tne fire for X were
quite chilled. I never see sich a goldin arted old party as that
kind soul proved as was reglar Hirish all over tho? lame thro?
roomatics and said as she could?t show me the way to the boats*
her grandson should as soon as ever he come in as ad gone over
to see a aunt as ad been at deaths door thro? being a orfin as
that dear old soul ad been brort up, as she said were as good a
boy as ever were born as is jest like them Hirish as will share
their last crust with one another and is somethink like relations.
Well I set awaitin and awaitin as that boy did?nt come in so
started at last for to find that boat and if that dear old creatur
did?nt take and obble a good bit along the road to put me in the
way, as would?nt take nothink for the tea and was quite put out
at me aofferin of it and drored herself up like Queen Wictoriers
fotty graft, a saying as I were welcome to wot she ad to offer and so
we parted reglar and warm friends like, but I ad?nt gone far when I
got sich a stich in my side as nearly drored me double, and lad to
set down agin a post for ever so long and not the least as is to take
for I?d come out without my little bottle of drops. It was a good
bit afore I were able to get on and when I did I were only able
to crawl not quite sure about the way to the boats, so at last I


asks a young feller if I were right for the steamer, as says Yes,
but look sharp for the last boat goes at a quarter to ten and its
arf past nine now. So I thanks im and urries on and its
lucky as it were all down ill, as shook me frightful and seemed
to jar my ead, but could?nt have done it up hill. I could see the
lights and the water close to me and jest then eard a steam
whistle and some parties passed me a runnin as ard as they
could pelt as I took and follered as quick as I could and jest
then there were another whistle as made me give a rush into the
boat ouse eadlong down some stairs and onto the gangway as
tipped a one side and down I slipped jest far enough to be up
to my knees in water and should ave been drownded but for
fallin across the rope as were oldin the steamer and in another
minit would ave been let loose. I were not many minutes in
gettin across the water and then got a cab ome and Mrs. Swelter
she got me to bed with ot water to my feet, and a good jorun of
gruel, as saved my life no doubt tho' I took a cold as settled on
my chest and laid me up for nearly a week and whyever they
dont ave a bridge across that water I can?t think, but you dont ketch
me goin out of a Sunday as shall be a reglar day of rest for me.
I were put out at that party as ad took me out as did?nt
come ome saying as it were all my fault for she supposed as I?d
found more agreeable friends to take tea along with, and as er
aunt ad been and waited for me till jest eight o?clock, and that
she ad come back to look for me so lost the boat and ad to stop all
night, but Mr. Swelter ad eard somethink about er as she did?nt
fancy so give er conjee as the french says, and when I were
better and come down agin I found as she?d left so told Mrs.


Swelter of er behaviour as said she were glad to get nd of er.
It were days afore I were out agin then ouly a little way
in the evenin and never did I walk on sich pavement never as
aintsafe partiklar after dark as is laid down jest a purpose to
trip you up, for they puts one stone a inch or two igher or lower
than the next one as you can?t see, but ketches your toe and
sends von a flyin forard and so it were as I turned a corner the
pavement ketched me and I come full butt agin that double
faced creeture agin the Post Office as says cld up mother, who
been a shoutin for you so early. I was put out I says I begs as
you wont address none of your remarks to me. Hallo ! she says
ere?s a lark, and lot of boys and young fellers was astandm
round and if she did?nt say, ere boys give three cheers for
Mother Brown and welcome to Sydney as is a reglar old swell at
orae. Ooray. So a seein as she were in licker I tried to get
past er, but she says come old soul dor,t bear no malice I?m sorry
as I sold you last Sunday it was only my fun. I says let me go by.
If she didn?t begin a dancin about andketchin old of my harm
begin a draggin me up a passidge by the side of the Post Office
sayin as she?d shout and all them boys a foljerin and a ollenn.
So I calls out to a elderly party as was a passsin, as up and spoke
for me to a perliceman as drove them boys away and as to that
party she lewanted, and that old gentleman spoke werry civil
ihffi it were sewere for he says you looks like a respectable party,
but you did ought to be more pertickler wot company you keeps
for the Perlica tells me you?re fond of goin about with them
larrikins as aint becomin at your time of life.
It reglar took my brealh away to be spoke to like that so


didn?t make im no answer but got into a bus as were passin as
set me down at the corner of the street where we was a stayin as
made me shed tears to think as I should be insulted and all for
nothink but that fieldmale?s impidence as a woman X will not
call er.
I must say as Sydney is a wonderful place for the public con-
weyances, and no wonder as people dont care to walk over them
pavements, not but wot busses is as bad and cabs wuss for joltin
the life out of you as is why I likes the tramway as runs as
smooth as glass.
What I liked best in Sydney were agoin to see the Parlymint
as sets in a noble room with no ginger bread about it and see the
Speaker as they calls im?as they made me take a seat behind is
chair a waitin for im to speak as never opened is mouth all the
time I were there tho? there was others as did.
Some on em was lovely speakers as spoke out with no umbug,
and that plane as I could understand jest the same as if I was a
talking myself.
Its a mussy as they?ve got them Parlymints all over the place
out ere, for there wouldn?t be no time to attend to nothink Colo-
nial at ome and its a good thing as parties can talk as lets off
the steam as the sayin is.
They do say as Meryker wouldn't never ave turned rebels
agin Ingland if they?d had a Parlymint not but wot its too much
of a good thing nowadays at ome as sets night arter night a
jawin and neglectin their business as is only one of their Spoutin
Clubs like Mechanics Institutes as is a amusement and keeps
men out of the public ouse but only ends in talk as some is fond.


of showing off ih/ for langwidge give me the Parlymint as I
eard the other night.
I must say as some on em as got a nasty abit of contradiction
werry rude as is why that speaker sets there without openin of
is mouth so as he may listen and call em to order if they forgets
their manners, not as he called to order nothink in the way of
refreshment as the only thing as were aperient were a bottle of
water as nobody didn?t touch thro? bein too sharp for that as
there?s no doubt a refreshment bar close by and the same as at
London where parties is called to swear and stand drinks round
if theyr?e adoin anythink agin the rules as is werry strict.
But as to swearin thats wot that there Bradlor wouldn?t do at
ome so they?ll let im off with is solemn davy as he give as no doubt
he?ll keep just as good as is hoaih, cos if he dont believe m
nothink why should he speak the truth, or do anythink else as
he dont like so long as he can keep out of arms way as is arms
length of the Perlice.
They aint got in the way of avin no reglar stand up fights the
same as when I were in Melbung them members got a am.rn.6i in
one another, jest to show their sperrits as is in course werry
becomin to set a example to them low larrixins out or doors.
Melbung aint that old stabiished place like Sydney as is more
like Ingland as is wot they all aims at natrally as is why they as
Parlyments, and speakers, and judges, and lawyers and bishops
as one on em is six feet six and seventy six with a wife, that
young and charmin, and as every body envies im.
They aint got no ouse of Lords, cos there aint no Lfrls, but
only one as ave been sent out for to be Governor jest for the look
of the thing.


Cos in course if there was a ouse of Lords Queen Wictorier
would ave to come and open it as would be a long way from
"Windsor and He of Wite as I?ve seen er do many a time bless er
royal art, asettin in that grand coach of era, as did used to be all
plate glass, so could see er well in er royal robes with her
crown on er ead as aint never used now thr bein in widder weeds
ae she likes to do things more on the quiet, as did used to be a
noble sight with all them nobility, and drored by them cream
colour orses er as looked proud of the job as well they might be
noble hanimals.
So as there aint no native lords for to make a ouse out on
they?re been and made a upper chamber as is the best they can
do, and arf a loaf is better than no bread as the sayin is, and
that upper ouse is all swells in course and that snug with lovely
easy chairs, and I?m sure I should ave a good nap in if I ad to
set up late of a night a thinkin as always send me off to sleep.
I eard them upper ouse parties atalking as spoke out werry
plain jest like the iangwidge in the lower ouse but I must say as
them upper crusts aint got not much feelin for anyone as is in
afflictions.
Cos there were one party as was aperiently werry much over-
come when a talkin about is sorrers sayin he were a widder and if
they did?nt all bust out alar fin, as showed as they was a flinty
arted lot cos in course he meant as he d been and buried is good
lady as would bo called a widder out ere. where everythink is
different to at ome leastways exactly the oppersite thro parties
not aweariu no mournin only a black band round the harm like
sojers and sailers at ome and all the Queen?s footmen as aint


never been took out of mournin entire since she were left a
widder as is gettin on for twenty years.
As Sydney ave got a noble statute on im up by the Eaik, as
is a nice opin space, with Captain Cook the other end as was the
fust to discover this ere noble land and must ave been proud for
to think as he?d made that good use of is heyes, tho? he little
though wot it would some to in a undered years with
that lovely Exybishun sprung up like a musheroor. ss I?m
sorry as I did?nt see as was all thro? New Zealin as was lost time
tho? all weny well in its way or I wish as it ad?nt been so much
in mine, cos I should like to ave seen all wonderful things as
they showed in most cases, jest for all the world like them things
as ave been see afore tho? no doubt improved, as is wot Exy-
bishuns is for.
The best thing es I?ve see in Sydney as some calls it New
South Wales, as must be because of the lovely flanmns and
blankets as is made ere, cos we all known as the Welsh fust
inwenti d flannins, but I were a sayin the best thing as I?vo see
is no beggars about and every one at work with good wages and
purwishuns cheap and above all I?ve seen them as I knowed that
ard up at tbrivin and doin well for it give me sich a turn a
gettin a letter from a party as I knowed over in Ingland that
destitute as it made you?re art bleed and no fault of is thro? bem
a steady man as ever trod shoe leather and as for er ard work
were er wital breath, but some ow could?nt never get on and er
father a reglar old skin flint as said they might starve and be
wot I would?nt think of a silin my lips a repeating of sich a
espression as dont never sound well in a lady?s mouth, as shall


certingly go to see em that soon as we?re a goin up the country.
As to that party as I met when I fust landed we did went
to dine with em and is family Brown and me as aye got a lovely
ouse as I said afore as he sent for us to dinner in wot he called
a steam lunch, not as there was any eatin or drinkin about.
We certingly did enjoy ourselves as ad friends to meet us and
made me tell e?m all ow he came to know me and give me a gold
locket, and Brown a breast pin afore we come away as shows as
there?s arts as can feel for another as I?m sure I should?nt never
ave breathed a sylabul about it tho? I could see im a standin
afore me as he did thirty odd years ago a fair haired young
feller, and now that dark with is air aturnin jest over is temples.
For it was dreadful ard weather one of them winter days as
mak( s your rnarrer freeze as I were dreadful mopey for I?d
berried our fust in is teeth as were a fine child and ad fretted a
deal over im and Brown he was gone away for to look arter
some work, and we was?nt flush so I said as I should let the
parlours while he was gone, as rote me out a lovely bill thro
being a reglar copperplate and isself I only put that bill up the
fust thing and was a settin at the winder when I see a young
gent walk by and look up. I says to myself I wonder if he?s
on the look for apartments as dont look like the sort of parties
as lodges about ere as only as beds and breakfast, with a egg for
their teas in a gen?ral way if there aint mo cold meat or it might
be a rasher of bacon.
While I were adnnkin if he did?nt come and knock at the
door, and when he come in he said. Wlhat a nice clean place.
So I were a thinkin what to ask im, w/hen he says could you
take a lady.


I says that depends cos there?s ladies and ladies as looks out
for lodgins.
Oh ! he says its my wife, quite proud.
I says oh! indeed a thinkia as he were full young for a ushin.
He says the fact we re goin abroad, and then he stopped.
Well I says sir, I suppose you only want trunptrary commo-
dations.
He says jest so, but you see the lady will require care for she?s
delicate.
I says where is she now ?
He says in a cab at the end of the street and he says aturnin
red if you wont take er in she must go to the workus for she?s
werry ill. I says never you dont mean it, and I says let the lady
come and see the rooms. He rushes out and calls to the cab to
draw up to my door and afore I knowed where I was that sweet
young lady were on my sofy arf a faintin as me and Mrs. Challin
ad?nt ardly time to get to bed afore that girl were born jest like
a dream in my back parlour.
He told me all about it as were all thro? a run away match from
bordin school and er m t seventeen and im under twenty.
He were in a orful state afore the night were out for she went
offer ead and the doctor did?nt give no opes at fust.
But I srys I?ve knowed wuss cases as ave been mother?s often
afore they?re done as cheered im up.
I liked is ways for he give me all is istory and ad?nt got ardly
no money as is famly rote insultin letters about er. But he were
the true briton for ho stuck to er down to pawnin is watch and
rings and then found a friend in a ui cle as come to see em off to
Injier with that infant six weeks old.
And as I can say now its been worth comin all the way to
Sydney to see sich beppiness and all I can say is with all my art
to a country as ave been a ome, and a good ome, to the unfortinate.
Adwance Horsetrailier wherever you goe?, but not too fast,
and imitate them kangeroos as looks afore they leaps.
