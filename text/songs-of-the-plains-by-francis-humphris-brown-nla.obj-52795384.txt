PROEM.
TF you are chilled and blue at fortune’s frown,
Your funds reduced to less than half-a-crown,
And grim despair has got you down.
Well —that’s the time to look up Francis Brown.
He’ll warm you up and you’ll forget your pain;
He’ll blow the choking dust from heart and brain;
His chaff will prove as good as golden grain.
For he’ll persuade you you can laugh again.
With all his fun, too, he can stand the test
Of human sympathies, for in his breast
There beats, as many a verse will manifest.
The hungering heart of all the spacious West.
The late J. le Gay Brereton.
The University of Sydney.


NOTE
Francis Humphris Brown was born in Echuca, Vic-
toria, in 1884, the thirteenth child of John Humphris
Brown and his wife, Elizabeth, whose trading steamers
are still remembered along the Murray and the Darling.
As a lad he was educated at the Fort Street High School,
Sydney, and as a young man was employed as an
engineer in the N.S.W. Railways and Tramways Depart-
ment, devoting his leisure to athletics, fishing, butterfly
hunting and writing.
Then the War came and made athletics and butter-
fly hunting, and even writing, seem trivial and imper-
tinent. He did not go to fight the Turks and the
Germans to save civilisation; instead he stayed at home
and tried to fight the War madness, and when the War
pressed too closely, he would put out to sea in his
fishing boat and seek to forget all about it. But the
War proved stronger than he, and after the Railway
and Tramway Strike of 1917, in which he took an
active, and perhaps injudicious part, he suffered a
nervous breakdown. On his recovery, he went to
Bourke and joined his brothers, who stiU ran a steamer
service along the Darling that was now but a ditch of
its former self.
There he lived for sixteen years.
Then in January, 1933, he came down to the City to
arrange for the publication of this book, but fearing
the recurrence of an old malady, he returned to the
West, and within a week was dead.
His youthful ambition had been to write, and in
middle-a'ge he had returned to his ambition, handi-
capped by the lack of practice of the intervening years.
The pity was he died when he did, just when he was
mastering many of the faults of these verses, and sub-
jects and words were crowding on him with a hitherto
undreamt-of rapidity.
So now, in deference to that Tyrant who cares little
or nothing for such things, this volume alone must serve
to beg him a modest place in the world of Australian
Letters. There is no need for it to beg him a place
in the hearts of the people of the Far West, even to
the dusky people of the Mission Stations, to all of
whom he gave unstintingly of his work in recital and
print.
KENNETH BARRATT.

INTRODUCTION
’HHIS not for critics’ praise I sue
A As with an art unskilled I woo
The Muse... but for the outcast who
Must sweat and groan,
Who bears the burden and the strain.
Whose labours are another’s gain,
Who harvests not the golden grain
His hands have sown.
It is for him I make a chart,
A survey straight unto the heart
Where happiness I might impart
From time to time.
For it, I think, must be confessed
The greatest truths are ofttimes dressed
In plainest garb and are expressed
In home-spun rhyme.
As rivers that from mountains flow
In rapids to the sea below
A more transparent stream will show
Than rivers long.
I have not lingered on the theme
Of which so many poets dream
On moon-hushed nights by star-lit stream,
Love’s sacred song.
A bard, I think, should not unroll
A manuscript that bares his soul
And in the public eye patrol
Its sanctuary.
Yet he who has not loved, I say.
In God’s eye is a castaway,
And cannot boast he lived a day
Though King he be.
On many themes I hope to write
Before there falls the endless night,
But to the singer comes a blight.
For it appears


Our greatest thoughts can find no tongue;
The purest pearls remain unstrung;
The sweetest songs are never sung
To mortal ears;
That rarest joys have fleetest wings;
The prisoned bird the sweetest sings;
The saddest song the longest clings
Unto the heart;
That ’tis the sinner, not the saint
With vision narrowed by restraint.
From Nature’s mirror best can paint
And truth impart;
That pomp and power steeped in pride
With danger gallop at each stride,
And in the end outpaced must ride
While jesters mock.
And that it is a steadfast law
The lamb must feel the lion’s claw.
And that the rich man shall abhor
The peasant’s smock;
That no man’s captain of his soul.
And that the ship he would control
Is tempest-tossed from pole to pole
At Fate’s decree.
And that the rudder, keel and mast
Are shaped from structures of the past,
As from our birth the die is cast
Of destiny.
And when as through tear-mists I see
A suffering humanity
Prometheus-bound, the soul of me
In pity yearns
And craves the gift divine to sing
In tune to music of a string
From harp with Christ-notes echoing
The soul of Burns,
And should one note in ringing clear
Glean sorrow’s joy from bygone year,
The memory that distils the tear
Is mine in part.
And should my jests but entertain
One hapless nomad of the Plain,
Then after all, ’twere not in vain
I set my chart.


SONGS OF THE PLAINS




GUNDABOOKA’S CUP
jP'ORSOOTH, what hair-brained prodigy
Lords o’er the Land of Dreams?
A sophist and a harlequin
Rolled into one it seems.
Who screens a picture on the mind
That changes in a thrice
From comedy to tragedy
Debauchery and vice.
’Twas thus this prodigy one night
Played havoc with my brain.
When, filled with sodden Johnny cakes,
I slumbered on a plain.
While in this dream I chanced to meet
A bagman like myself,
Who, through deficiency of brain,
Was forced to live by stealth.
He seemed in trouble more or less.
Like one who’d travelled far;
He said he was a trainer once.
And hailed from Coolabah.
At first I thought ’twas hatter-trash.
He spoke, and yet to hear
The way that he expressed himself
It seemed he was sincere.
So, like the wedding 'guest who stopped
To hear a shell-back wail,
I listened as he spun for me
An interesting tale.
And he would pause at intervals.
As one who would recall
Some incidents in years long dead
That held his soul in thrall.
Quoth he, “The sun was like a ball
When seen through crimson wine.
When Gundabooka won the cup
In nineteen-forty-nine.”


On mentioning forty-nine, I deemed
The man through too much beer.
Or from exposure to the sun.
At times was slightly queer.
But, picking up a Bulletin,
I chanced to see the date.
And to my great surprise I found
’Twas nineteen-ninety-eight.
It seemed that I, like Lazarus,
Had risen from the dead
To find the world I’d left behind
Was forging still ahead.
So after I’d apologised
For tangling up the date,
I listened as he did to me
A story strange relate.
“M’Craighen was the man,” he said,
“Who hit upon a scheme
That brought us wealth and luxury
Beyond our wildest dream.
“He was a scientific bloke.
In scientific way
He talked of science in his sleep.
As well as through the day,
“Until at length he entered on
A scientific course;
In order that he might produce
A heat-resisting horse.
“I helped M’Craighen train his stud,
And that was only when
The weather gauges registered
A century and ten.
“Adapt a horse to circumstance
Was what M’Craighen taught;
Although, it often was remarked,
He was a shingle short.


“In winter time lie warmed the stalls
By scientific heat;
And exercised in possum rugs
His prads along the street.
“So hardy did they grow at length.
So physically well,
M’Craighen swore he’d win a heat
Across the hobs of hell.
“We carried off the Tilpa plate
By fifteen lengths or more;
We won the Doradilla cup
And sweepstakes in galore.
“But ah! I never shall forget
The joy that once was mine.
When Gundabooka won the cup
In nineteen-forty-nine.
“By Drought King out of Prickly Pear
Was Gundabooka’s breed,
A brother to the hardy colt
They christened Wattle Seed,
“Because it seemed he wanted heat
Before he’d make a show.
As wattle seeds must needs be burnt
Before they’ll start to grow.”
And here he mentioned how the late
Dictator, Mr. Lang,
Had passed a measure in the House
To please the sporting gang —
“A Bill that said the Melbourne Cup
Should, in each year, be run
At different centres in the States
And not confined to one.
“And so it chanced in forty-nine,
The Cup was run in Bourke
To give the citizens a chance
To punt whilst out of work.


“M’Craighen was a happy man,
The day he heard the news.
As, ever and anon, he asked
His pals to have a booze.
“Then to his great delight he heard.
Of all good news the best,
A prophesy that reckoned on
A heat wave in the West.”
And here my friend, the hatter, waved
His lank arms in the air,
As if he saw the race again
And heard the bookies swear.
dried he, “Five fielders dropped stone dead
And ten ran off the line.
When Gundabooka won the Cup
In nineteen-forty-nine.”
dried he, “I’ve known the time, when frogs
Have frizzled in the lakes.
When deaths from apoplexy were
Occurring ’mongst the snakes,
■“But never do I recollect
A blast like forty-nine;
The fish fermented as you stooped
To lift them off the line.
"“So great the heat the clergy gulped
The sacramental wine,
And drank the holy water
In the blast of forty-nine.
“Before the race the Stewards held
A meeting, where they passed
Some rules, pro bono publico ,
To counteract the blast.
“They ordered that each horse should be
Provided with a fan.
And ice-packs should be freely used
By prad as well as man.


“No By-law ever framed by clubs
Could please M’Craighen more.
Who saw a chance to work a stunt
He’d never worked before.
“And though he guessed that he was up
Against a classic flock
He knew the son of Drought King came
Of heat-resisting stock.”
And here my friend in accents spoke
Vociferous and rash,
As punters do, who know a cert
When minus of their cash.
Cried he, “Bare-footed Harry changed
His booze to champagne wine
When Gundabooka won the Cup,
In nineteen-forty-nine.”
And here he threw his arms about.
In such a frenzied way,
That I began to think at last
His mind had gone astray.
Quoth he, “The colt was entered for
The Cup and Gidgea Stake;
We backed him in the former race,
The latter was a fake.
“For well we knew with ice-packs up
And cool electric fan,
The son of Drought King would be found
Amongst the also-ran.
“And so it proved; the first event
Was won by Foaming Sea,
A pink-eyed freak, as white as snow,
Of English pedigree.
“Although it seemed that Flaming Youth
Had run him to a head,
Whilst Gundabooka seemed to be
The deadest of the dead.


“He finished ten lengths to the bad.
As though his heart was broke,
While bookies in derision jeered,
And christened him the ‘Joke’!
“The Cup was timed for three o’clock;
The heat was then intense;
The paint began to sizzle on
The Stand and Leger fence.
“When Gundabooka wheeled to do
A prelim, up the course.
The inside punters yelled until
Their throttles sounded hoarse.
“ ‘l’ll lay a pony to a crown’.
Cried Pearson with a smile,
A cunning stunt on Pearson’s part
The public to beguile.
“Then every punter West of Bourke,
Poured money on the Joke,
Until it seemed, if he should win,
The fielders would be broke.
“But ere the barrier was reached,
M’Craighen and his boy
Removed the ice-packs and the fans
To wait results with joy.
“When Gundabooka sniffed the heat,
The heat he loved so well,
His eyes they shone like fiery coals,
That pave the road to Heß.
“Three times the barrier he broke
Before they got a start.
No horse that ever breasted tape
Appeared in better heart.
“The start saw Flaming Youth jump out
To gain a two-length lead.
Whilst on the rails there followed fast
The hardy Wattle-Seed.


■“ ’Twas Doradilla made the pace.
The colt Jack Duggan bred.
To gain a break of seven lengths,
Though he was labelled ‘dead’.
“The half-mile saw the White begin
To move from out the ruck;
It seemed that he must surely win
With any kind of luck.
“The gap that Doradilla made
He closed in classic style,
And led the bunch by several lengths
Before they reached the mile.
“But here the Joke began to move
In such a taking way,
It seemed he yet might be the horse
The books would have to pay.
“‘Well—ten to one about the Joke,’
A paddock bookie yelled.
Who through his glasses well could see.
The colt was being held.
“The two-mile saw the field strung out,
The White horse leading still,
Whilst Doradilla petered out
As though he’d had a pill.
“But here a thundering sound was heard.
As if the grandstand broke;
When Pearson cried, ‘Hullo, what’s this?
Gawd’s struth!—M’Craighen’s Joke!’
“Then like the wind he seemed to fly;
The Flaming Youth he caught; ..
And as he reached the favourite’s girth
The books were overwrought.
“As neck-to-neck they raced for home.
To fight it gamely out,
With scarcely thirty yards to go
The race was still in doubt.


“Until a mighty cheer rang out,
And deafening echoes broke:
‘The Favourite’s beat! The Favourite’s beat!
The Joke! He wins! The Joke!’
“And so he did—by half a length—
In record time they say;
And as I saw him finish then
I see him thus to-day.
“Once more I hear the fielders swear.
Whilst punters sip the wine.
When Gundabooka won the Cup
In nineteen-forty-nine!”
It must have been a fly, I think,
That o’er my face did creep.
That woke me from the rapture of
A stolen beauty sleep.
To moralise on Johnny cakes
Until the sun was up.
Which being “sods” I always blame
For Gundabookas Cup.
THE PRIDE OF M'TAGUE
t I ''HERE is no pride like an old man’s pride,
■*" As he thinks of the days that are dead;
The days of his youth when he knew no fear,
And the blood in his veins flowed red.
Yet the pride of M’Tague was a foolish pride,
For none but a man insane
Would cross in the time of drought the waste
That is known as the Deadman’s Plain.
And nobody reckoned M’Tague would take
The wager that Yorkey made;
As he covered a fiver, without demur,
That over the bar was paid.


Whilst Texas from Bre. with a smile remarked,
“He hasn’t the faintest show.
For I had it on with the camels once.
And I reckon us blokes should know.”
There is no life on the Headman’s Plain,
Where the Drought King rules supreme.
Guarding as spoils the bones that lie
In the bed of a phantom stream.
No life is there save a speck that is seen,
Slow rocking from side to side,
Like a craft that is viewed from a distant shore
At war with the wind and tide.
Yet the speck is a man, and the man M’Tague,
Who has boasted, but boasted in vain,
That what he could do in the days of his youth.
In his age he could do again.
But little he recked, as he watched the tongues
Of the spiral whirlies break.
That the track which he made through the Headman’s
Plain
Was the last that he would make.
’Twas Jimmy the dogger who found a pad,
The night we had mustered late,
By a stump not far from a dried-up tank
To the north of the boundary gate.
So we followed the pad along a fence
To the ramp at the two-mile lane,
Across the sand to a billabong,
Then back to the fence again,
Where a track we discovered that made us halt
And speak in a muffled breath:
’Twas a track retrod that we knew too well.
Was the tell-tale track of death.
Then a pad we discovered that led away
To make for the scalded ground,
Where under a leopard wood was seen
A track that had circled around—


A pad as a frenzied beast would make.
That follows a ringing course,
Around, around the tree it showed
Like the pad of a circus horse.
And yet once again did the track lead off
To make for the lower ground.
Where close to the roots of a lignum clump
A boot and a sock we found.
Then a track we discovered not far from the boot.
Half buried in shifting sand,
And a little later the pad of a knee
As well as the prints of a hand.
And then was there noticed a drawn-out pad.
Lake the marks of a trailing prong.
That could have been made by a dying man
Had he dragged his feet along.
Then a hat we discovered beside the trail,
A pint and a billy-can,
A blood-stained shirt that was torn to shreds.
And the corpse of a naked man,
With its face as black as the hell-black crows.
The left cheek gnawed away,
The right arm pointing across to where
The phantom waters lay,
Which seemed, as it were, to mock at the man
Who had boasted, but boasted in vain.
That what he had done in the days of his youth.
In his age he could do again.
SCOTTY’S “WILD STUFF STEW”
r I cause of all the trouble
Was M’Cabe, the jackeroo,
Who had ordered what, facetiously
He’d christened “Wild Stuff Stoo”;


He had shot a brace of pigeons.
And had brought them home unplucked;
It was not the first occasion.
And no wonder Scotty bucked.
As aside he threw the pigeons
And addressed the jackeroo:
“Ye’ll pluck those blinded pigeons,
Or ye’ll get no blinded stoo.”
But the jackeroo objected.
And objected strongly, too.
Said he, “I’m not a slushy;
You can keep your blinded stoo.”
But Scotty didn’t argue much,
He winked across at Blue
And, turning to the slushy, said,
“I’U give him ‘Wild Stuff Stoo’.”
The next day it was Sunday, and,
Not having much to do,
We all assisted Scotty
In the making of a stoo.
We raked along the wool-sheds,
In the pens and round about —
It was marvellous, all the wild things.
That us rousies fossicked out;
There was Ginger found a lizard,
Which they reckoned was a Jew —
It was rather rough to handle,
But it softened in the stew;
Then Snowy found some hairy things
Inside a musterer’s tent;
And Splinter found a lady frog—
And in the lady went.
From McGregor, who’d been foxing,
We obtained a shin or two.
It should have gone to Bootlace,
But it went into the stoo.
Then someone found a “Kelly”
That the boundary-rider shot—
It was more or less fermented.
Still, it went inside the pot;


And Scotty found some insects
With an over-powering scent,
And the Slushy trapped a mother mouse—
And in poor mother went.
There was some hesitation
’Bout a spider in a tin:
We didn’t like the small red spot.
But Scotty dumped it in.
There were a host of other things,
I can’t recall the lot,
That were cast into eternity,
Per medium of the pot.
Those strange and weird concoctions
That the Abos sometimes brew
Would be as mild potations
If compared with Scotty’s stew...
And when the jackeroo arrived
A happy man was he
To find that Scotty, after all.
Had cooked a stoo for tea.
He rolled his eyes, and snuffed the fumes,
’Twas dinkum stuff he swore;
He complimented Scotty, and
He passed his plate for more.
And when we’d let him have his fill,
We took him round to view
A list of what had left this world
To enter Scotty’s stew.
I grant you there were wild things
Connected with that stoo,
But there was nothing wilder
Than M’Cabe the jackeroo.
He got the dries and then the shakes,
And we felt shaky too;
We were thinking of the spider
With the red spot in the stoo.
We rushed him to the homestead.
They told him there ’twas flu,
But us rousies, we knew better—
It was Scotty’s “Wild Stuff Stoo.”


But Scotty isn’t cooking now.
For Scotty long is dead;
They say he turned it in through booze
At Thurlagoona shed;
And away across the border
There’s a certain jackeroo,
Who for years has never tasted
What he christened “Wild Stuff Stoo.”
THE DROUGHTY WEST
is no such thing as a sign for rain,”
The man from the border said
To his mate as they watched the lightning flash
And the clouds pass overhead.
“There is no such thing as a sign for rain,
And a prophet’s a mug at his best;
There may be a sign in some other part.
But I’m damned if there is in the West.
“The wind may blow from the east for months,
And the smoke loom low on the plain,
The sky become black as the ace of spades.
Yet still you may get no rain.
“The moon may arrive in a way that suggests
It is rain she is emptying out,
And the frogs may hold a corroboree
AH night in the kitchen spout.
“The ducks and the swans may all leave their haunts
And flutter across the plain;
The curlews may screech till their throttles grow hoarse,
And still you will get no rain.
“The flies may grow dopey and stick to you close
As a hum or a mother-in-law;
The ants may shift camp to the highest trees.
And the insects appear in galore;


“The tenderest coni on your trilby may throb,
You may suffer rheumatic pain;
The salt and the sugar may both go limp.
And still you will get no rain.
“The moon may look down from a murky sky.
With a halo that’s fit for a saint;
Your favourite canary may snuff with the heat,
And the oldest inhabitant faint.
“The clouds may appear in the east and the west,
With lightning both fork and chain,
The thunder may peal till the cows come home,
And still you will get no rain.
“For there’s no such thing as a sign for rain,”
The man from the border said
To his mate as they watched the lightning flash
And the clouds pass overhead.
“There is no such thing as a sign for rain.
And a prophet’s a mug at his best.
There may be signs in some other part
But there’s none in the droughty West.”


TO DREAMS
E PRODIGY of dreams, how earnest thou
To be the lord of awe-hushed slumber worlds
And rule the truant children of the brain
With such a wanton inconsistency?
Art thou some fabled hare-brained deity,
That holds possession of the errant mind.
In moods as fickle as the changeful winds.
Or art thou mummer from the world of shades,


That takes a leasehold of the wandering brain
To conjure it at times perchance to please
The fitful fancies of the scheming gods?
A jester seemest thou in very truth.
Clowning our thoughts and making mockery of
The even tenor of sound argument.
Distorting truth till things incredible
Most credible appear. At other times
An artist skilled thou seemest who would paint
Full many a picture passing beautiful
Upon the panel of the mind reposed,
And, thwarting time, drag from oblivion
The visage of the one who long has slept
To give to it a semblance once again
More real than is reality itself;
And e’en though memories be rare, yet, is
A dream though transient more palpable.
As oft at night, behind the slumber-veils
That drape the psychic orbs, there is rehearsed.
In drama of a dream, scenes beautiful
As idyll of romance regarlanded
From groves Arcadian —thus it would seem.
Or else the heart’s rich legacy of pearls
Would not dissolve once more in liquid tears
As they are wont to do, when from a dream
The slumberer awakes with lost love’s kiss
Still fresh upon his lips.


THE GREAT GO-GATOR FIGHT
1%/T’GREGOR, though a boxing fan.
Was cultured in his way.
For science occupied his mind
Ry night as well as day.
He worked out theories in his head
Like scientists might do,
Until a theory he advanced
That seemed entirely new.
For when, as strolling through the bush.
He happened to alight
Upon an old goanna
And a black snake talking fight.
And when he saw the argument
In favour of the Go,
That hit the Jo-Blake’s head in halves,
His face began to glow.
“If monkey glands can do the trick,”
He cried, “then what about
A grafting of goanna glands?
There isn’t any doubt,
“If we only graft a few
On Slogger Joe from Bre.,
A white hope we could trot along
For all the world to see.”
And when he lay in bed that night,
His brain aR in a whirl.
Within his sleep he saw huge snakes,
And fierce goannas twirl
Around about in mortal fight
Until the snakes were spread
In mangled heaps upon the ground
With neither tail nor head.
And when the dawn appeared, he sent
A note to Dr. GiR,
A specialist who dealt in glands
Across at Broken Hill.


The doctor took the theory up,
And wired him by return.
Like doctors do when dealing with
A monet’ry concern.
He bade M’Gregor bring along
Goannas straight away.
That he might make experiments
And tests without delay.
Which from the first appeared to be
Successful past all dreams.
For after they were grafted on
Domestic cats, it seems
The dogs next door, of which the cats
For years had lived in dread,
Within a week were slinkin’ round
In fear of cats instead.
By Slogger Joe, who’d give an eye
To win a classic fight,
The thought of “them goanna glands”
Was hailed with wild delight.
And after he had had the graft,
So savage did he grow.
Instead of Slogger he received
The name Goanna Joe.
I don’t know whether by mistake
He got an over-dose.
But this I know the trainers had
To watch him mighty close,
For once he gave them quite a shock
When, in a private bar,
He ran amuck and chewed the head
Off Clancy’s pet galah.
And after he was trained a month,
A match at last we found
In one, a pug from Queensland side;
And word had passed around


He was a Dago with a reach
Like Johnson once possessed,
A trifle over seven feet
And sixty round the chest.
But yet that didn’t worry us,
For well we knew that Joe
Was seething with Goanna Glands,
So on we piled the dough.
But treachery it seems is found
In every branch of sport.
For soon a rumour passed around
That gave us food for thought.
We didn’t like his monniker
Which seemed to breed a chill.
For we had heard he fought by name
Of Alligator Bill;
And then from idle gossipers.
Who much abound in Bourke,
We heard that Doctor Gill had done
Some rather shady work.
Which proved correct, for later on
We found to our dismay
He’d flown across to Innisfail
And, in a bare-faced way.
Had grafted alligator glands
Beneath the Dago’s hide
And backed him for a thousand notes
To beat the other side.
The sports of Bourke, who dearly loved
To keep their pastime clean,
Had little time for anyone
Who practised tactics mean.
And so they didn’t hesitate,
On being double-crossed,
To pay the doctor with his coin.
Therefore no time was lost


To hold a meeting, whereupon
A scheme they did decide,
Which, under circumstances, seemed
To be quite justified.
“It’s any port,” the speaker said,
“When once you’re in a storm.
I move that in Goanna’s gloves
We sprinkle chloroform;
And if the ’Gator smothers not
In scientific way,
He’ll smother with the chloroform;
That’s all I have to say.”
The motion, duly seconded.
Was hailed with wild delight.
And now, that’s if it’s possible.
Will I describe the fight.
I’ve seen some orgies in my time,
When police have interfered.
When both the seconds and the judge
With blood have been besmeared.
I’ve seen the nasal organ bent
In strange fantastic way;
I’ve seen the windows of the soul
Refuse the light of day.
But never did I see a more
Revolting, loathsome sight.
Than I was asked to witness on
That memory-haunting night.
Perhaps you think I’m kidding like,
And scoff at my remarks.
But I assure you that at times
The audience saw sparks.
Bill Pierce, the referee, stood mute.
His surplus weight of beef
That until now had known no fear.
Was trembling like a leaf.
•o
33


So gruelling was the second round
The audience held its breath.
And crying, “This is murder,” sent
In haste for Sudden Death,
Who on his motor-bike arrived.
But little could he do.
Although in wild excitement, he
Both squirt and baton drew.
The Sergeant then arrived and tried
The massacre to check.
But ere another round was fought
Became a nervous wreck.
The hair was floating round the ring,
As fighting tooth and claw.
The ’Gator and Goanna hissed
From blood pools on the floor.
Until it seemed the ’Gator would
Completely wipe the deck,
For, with reptilian instinct, he
Had fastened on the neck.
At which the crowd began to hoot,
Demanding that a foul
Be given by the referee,
“The towel, throw in that towel!”
But ere the towel was hoisted in,
Of cheers there rose a storm.
As the Goanna doffed the glove
That held the chloroform.
And winking at the audience,
Triumphantly he pressed
The glove across the ’Gator’s mouth
And laid him out to rest.
At which there rose tumultuous cheers
From sportsmen clean of Bourke,
At having double-crossed the pug
Who did the dirty work,
Whilst intermingled with the cheers
Came hoots for Doctor Gill,
The specialist who dealt in glands
Across at Broken Hill.


THE LAST OF THE DARLING
DREADNOUGHTS
H ER , journeying done, neath a sheltering gum.
Where the mud-lark builds her nest,
With her keel sunk deep in a silting hole
Where the cod-fish move on a night patrol.
By a couch-grass bank where the wood-ducks stroll.
Lies the S.S. Nile at rest.
The last of the liners to stem the stream
With the currents running swift,
In the turbulent days, when the captains bold.
To humour the crew when the nights were cold.
Would sample a cask in the after-hold
At the end of the second shift.
And merry it was in the dawn to hear,
As the wild ducks flew ahead,
The splash, splash, splash of the dreadnought’s wheel.
As out from a timbered bend she’d steal
To straighten her barge on an even keel.
With a load from the Dunlop shed.
With a couple of feet on the Jemison’s rocks.
And a drought upon the land.
There wasn’t much peace for a dreadnought’s crew,
When the guts of the Darling had fallen through.
But there’s always a chance in a heavy dew
To float her across the sand.
And a terrible night was the night of a flood.
For the Captain who stood aghast,
When he met with the worst of catastrophes;
As tossed by the rapids against the trees.
His craft at an angle of fifty degrees
Was listed, and sinking fast.
And a pitiful sight was his face forsooth.
As, after the tragedy,
He gazed at his craft from the bank next morn.
With her deckings smashed in and her combings tom,
Her paddle-box stripped, and the galley borne
Away on an inland sea.


But never again shall we hear at the dawn,
As the wild-ducks fly ahead.
The splash, splash, splash of her paddle-wheel.
As out from a timbered bend she’d steal
To straighten her barge on an even keel,
With a load from the Dunlop shed.
FOR A FAITHFUL FRIEND
A NCIENT, you reckon? No, no, my friend.
Not ancient by any means;
I’ll never acknowledge my Lizzie as old
Until she is out of her teens.
She’s sweet seventeen, in the prime of her life.
With blood flowing hot in her veins.
Prancing about like a two-year-old,
Hopping across the plains.
She’s oiling in number one and two,
And missing in number three,
And her carby is coughing and spitting as though
She suffered from pleurisy.
There’s a bit of a knock in number four.
Which I reckon is due to neglect,
But when you consider the life that she’s led,
What else can a man expect?
I don’t know whether it’s want of oil,
Or whether it’s lack of grease,
But the Sergeant has ofttimes threatened me
With a stiff for disturbing the peace.
She’s a bit of a rogue at times, I know,
But she’s plucky and ever game.
As with a chit-a-chit-chit, bang, bang,
She gets there just the same.
And although she has vices, there’s this to admit.
My Lizzie has virtues as well.
Which reminds me: One night I was sneaking in late.
When I happened to hear a yell.


And on looking round a sight I observed,
That caused me to hold my breath;
For there on the corner I spotted a John,
Who is known as Sudden Death.
Now the sailors they say that a ship has a soul,
Which may or may not be true.
But you’ll have to admit that my Lizzie has one.
When the facts I impart to you:
At the moment she sighted Sudden Death,
She seemed to awake with a roar,
And for the first time in eighteen months.
She started to fire on four.
And another thing I must tell you about,
Of which I am slightly vain.
I was coming in with a load one night,
Low-gearing across the plain:
When a toff who drove up in a Chev. remarked.
As he puffed at a rich cigar,
“I reckon, Brownie, it’s up to you
To purchase a motor-car.”
When a little later I heard a sound.
Which it seemed was the low-gear screech
Of the Chev. that was owned by my toney friend.
Deep-bogged in a Bogan Reach.
And a hell of a shock he must have got.
For he couldn’t hold back a cheer,
When he saw my old girl with her ears cocked back
Take it in second gear.
And another surprise he must have got.
As I threw him a length of chain,
And with a chit-a-chit-chit, bang-bang,
I towed him out again.
And after I’d landed him on a crust,
He turned and he said good-day.
Remarking, “I don’t think I’d put her in yet;
She’s a motor-car, by the way.”
With which I agree, for I candidly think.
If my Liz was to burst into flame
A mile out of town, with a chit-a-bang-bang,
She’d get there just the same.


AN IDYLL OF A BOX-TREE PLAIN
C AID Bill, as he watched the whirlies lift
The dust from the grassless plain.
To the hoss who was fighting a three-year drought,
“I’m going to bring you some rain.
“I’m going to bring you some moisture, boss,
Just see if my words ain’t true;
It’s a marvellous thing, if a bloke ’as faith,
What a praying stunt will do.”
It seemed that the prayers of the faithful were heard.
For the drought, it broke that night;
And Bill as he woke from his slumbers smiled.
And chuckled with sheer delight.
“It’s me that the boss will blame for this,
There isn’t the slightest doubt;
I’ll be on a rise for a certainty,
I’ve broken the flamin’ drought.”
When the dawn appeared and the moisture lay
In sheets on the Box-tree plain,
Bill bristled with pride as he met the boss.
Near the tank at the half-mile lane.
“Well, what do you think of it now?” said Bill,
“There’s water in every tank.
Three inches I reckon on up to date,
And it’s me that you’ve got to thank.”
Yet never a thank you did Bill receive.
But a grunt from the boss instead,
Who, pointing across to a heap of bones
That lay on the clay-pan, said:
“Why didn’t you work your praying stunt
When the drought had just begun;
You’ve kept me waiting till half of my sheep
Are dead on the flamin’ run.”


A WESTERN SUMMER SONG
CUMMER is coming and so are the flies.
Sand-storms, mosquitoes, and bungy eyes;
Summer is coming, and so is the ’flu,
“Dengy” fever, and p’rhaps Barcoo;
Summer is coming and so are the bills
From the local doctor for faked-up ills:
So boys and girls come out and play,
The summer is coming, hip, hip, hooray.
Summer is coming—maybe a drought;
Mortgages due, and the banka squealing out;
Shopkeepers shakey and fearing a crash.
Refusing us credit, and asking for cash.
Summer is coming with crows on the shed
Holding a requiem over the dead:
So boys and girls come out and play,
The summer is coming, hip, hip, hooray.
Summer is coming and so is the snake.
With flat things at night-time to keep you awake;
Summer is coming, and so is a thirst
Which drives all and sundry to drink the accursed;
Summer is coming when Christians say “Damn!”
At the dust on the shelves and the ants in the jam:
So boys and girls come out and play,
The summer is coming, hip, hip, hooray.
Summer is coming and so are the nights,
When we use citronella, and fight for our rights;
Summer is coming and so is the heat.
Cheeses in action and fly-blown meat;
Butter skew-wiffy—milk gone queer,
Dry counter lunches, and luke-warm beer:
So boys and girls come out and play,
The summer is coming, hip, hip, hooray.


A PRAYER FOR RAIN
■I I HE Drought King, spoiler of the land,
ll*/ ■ *Has turned our fertile plains to sand;
II M ■ Like harpies in some old-world tale,
|| t ■ The crows are perched on every rail;
H With bloody beaks and raucous cry,
From staggering stock they rip the eye;
Ha Ha Like tomb-stones heaped upon the run,
dead wool glistens in the sun.
Great God of love, on bended knee
We ask, yea, ask most fervently,
Look Thou upon this naked plain,
And in Thy mercy send the rain.


But yester mom I chanced to see
A starving beast in misery;
Beside her lay some skin and bone,
... A little calf that gave a moan;
She bent and licked its quivering hide.
Then very feebly turned aside
And looked at me, as if to say,
“I can’t hold out another day;
Don’t waste your time on my behalf
But try and save my baby calf.”
Great God who could such love bestow
In these Thy creatures here below,
Where in their shrunken hides we see
That spark divine... maternity,
Turn on the tap of heaven’s main.
And out of pity send the rain.
Last night I saw beneath some trees
Two eyeless lambs, dead on their knees.
Methought in their last hours of pain
The wretched things had prayed for rain.
Great God, if such a thing has been
Look Thou upon this awful scene,
Look Thou upon Thy lambs in pain
And in Thy mercy send the rain.
The good folk say the drought is sent
By heavenly power as punishment—
As punishment to work us woe
For crimes that we have done below—
But, Lord, what crime beneath the sun
Have patient sheep and cattle done
That they should suffer hellish pain
And starve to death upon a plain?
So once again on bended knee
We ask, yea, ask most fervently,
Look Thou upon this naked plain
And out of pity send the rain.


SAGACITY
“D°” ’T brag no more about them tripe-hound stunts
You calls ‘sagacity’,”
Said Scotty, “till you’ve heard the yam about
A dorg once owned by me —
“A rough-and-tumble sort of gentleman.
Us blokes called Bindyi,
Who was I think some way related to
That dorg from Gundagai.
“ ’Twas in the ‘Ninety-eight’ we’d struck a lead,
The worst I ever knew.
The tanks was more than forty miles apart
And tucker joints were few.
“We’d rationed out the orphan Johnny cake;
The meat supply was done;
The game it seemed was at its very worst
When Bindy got a ‘run’.
“‘Hurray!’ we cried, ‘for good old Bindyi!
Are we downhearted? No!’
As hell-for-leather through a Gidgea clump
We watched the old tyke go.
“No time was lost in getting on his track
That led across a plain.
As through the Mitchell grass we followed him
Along the four-mile lane.
“We missed him in a dried-up lignum swamp.
Not far from Casey’s bore.
But at tbe horseshoe billabong we came
Upon his tracks once more.
“And though our wind we felt was failing fast.
Our hopes were running high
At visions of a ’roo-steak soup for tea.
Or p’raps a rabbit pie.
“At last we came upon his heels, not far
From Daley’s wooden ramp,
When all at once we saw him wheel, and make
A bee-line back to camp.


Said Bluey, ‘Strike me handsome, after this
I’ll eat my flamin’ hat
If Bindyi ain’t got the Darlin’ pea
And sufferin’ from a rat.’
“Said Snowy, after scratchin’ at his head,
‘You dopes...why can’t you see
There’s only one thing Bindy’s suff’rin’ from
And that’s sagacity.
“ ‘We’re double-crossed, too right, that’s what we are.
The run was all a fake—
A frame-up on the part of Bindyi
To pinch our Johnny cake.’
“ ‘Eh, ease it, cut the rough stuff out,’ said Blue,
But Snowy turned out right.
For when at length with tired and swollen feet
We reached the camp at night,
“We found old Bindy in the land of bliss.
Beside the camp fire-place,
The Johnny cake inside him, and a smile
Of triumph on his face.
“So now you’ve got the strong of Bindyi,
Don’t come no more to me,”
Concluded Scotty, “with them gags of yours
About sagacity.”
THE PROXY COOK
TVTOW this is the rhyme of the proxy cook,
' And the proxy cook that’s me,
Who by means surreptitious achieved renown
On the Pride of the Murray, that left the town
Of Echuca for stations further down
In the year of ’B3.


And motherless stoney was I at the time,
As I moped on a truss of hay
Chewing the end of a piece of grass.
Like a punter distraught, who has lost his brass,
When the boss of the Pride, who chanced to pass,
Appeared in a troubled way;
“Can you cook?” was the question he put to me.
And smiling I made reply,
“Oh yes, I can cook; do you want a man?”
I further remarked, as an idea ran
Through my mind, as I thought of an excellent plan.
That needed the aid of a lie.
For ’twas seldom indeed that I spoke an untruth.
But my freedom that day was at stake.
For the Johns had just ordered me out of the town.
And of monet’ry earnings I hadn’t a brown,
And colloquially speaking my tail-end was down,
So a job was I forced to take.
But when I had boarded the S.S. Pride
My spirits began to drop.
For of all the slow poisoners under the sun.
Without any doubting, I was the one
That people who value their lives should shun.
For I couldn’t dish up a chop.
But there is a tide, I have heard it remarked.
That our destinies holds in sway.
Which if taken at ebb may prove to be
The chance for an opportunity.
With which I am rather inclined to agree
For I happened to meet, that day,
A ministering angel, aboard the Pride,
Who, seeing me in dismay,
Remarked with a smile on her angel face
As soon as I’d stated the facts of the case,
“Well, how about letting me take your place?
That’s if you are willing to play


The part of a proxy cook, whilst I
The entrees and dishes prepare.
As passing them camouflaged down below,
I could give you the signal by tapping my toe
Three times on the decking to let you know
When the coast from all danger is clear.”
And that evening the angel discovered, for eggs
A weakness the Captain possessed.
So when in the morning table was laid.
There were dishes alluring of hen-fruit displayed,
That a joy to the heart of the Captain conveyed.
Which the smiles on his face expressed.
•On the menu for dinner was entree of tongue.
Served up with asparagus sauce.
With casserole dishes of duck and green peas,
With croquets and mince-balls, spaghetti and cheese,
With salads in season and dressing to please;
And then, for another course.
There were fillets of cod-fish in olive oil fried.
And seasoned with juice of a lime,
And next was there served as a topping-up course
A gateau of prunes with a wine-flavoured sauce,
And a cherry liqueur to reinforce
The palate from time to time.
And after the banquet had come to an end.
The skipper he called me aside,
And drawing a cork from a flask of the best
Old overproof rum from his private chest,
'To me a most flattering toast addressed.
As blushing some nips I tried.
Whilst a squatter who happened to be aboard
A suggestion was pleased to make.
That I cook for his homestead at Binnaway,
And added that he’d be willing to pay
Expenses first-class for the journey each way.
If the job of a chef I would take.


At the port of Kondrook I was fated, it seems.
The zenith of fame to reach,
For the barge-master loading me up with booze,
And praising my entrees and savoury stews,
Most embarrassing epithets sought to choose
In a long after-dinner speech.
But the star of my fortune was doomed to wane,
For the angel was leaving next day.
And knowing that I by the crew would be damned
To perdition, if left to the cooking, I crammed
A lie down the throat of the Captain, and shammed
That my health had given way.
And so on the morrow I disembarked.
With an angel that walked by my side,
And to prove there are tides that our destinies sway,
In concluding my story allow me to say
That the cook who is doing my cooking to-day
Is the angel I met on the Pride.
THE HAPPY BAGMAN
TT is seldom indeed that I’ve carried a swag.
Though it’s not out of pride that I boast.
For of all the men I have pitied at times,
’Tis the ba'gman I’ve pitied the most,
Who, with arched back burdened and blistered feet.
The drought-cursed track must tread.
Not wanted, forsaken, a derelict.
Drifting from shed to shed.
Who is given the knock by the Pommy chef.
And the shearers’ cook as well.
Cursed by the squatter that fills his bags.
And wished by the cocky to hell.


So I never scoff as I’ve heard them scoff,
At a brother in his plight;
Or say as I oft have heard it said.
With a slur, that it serves him right.
For there are men, and I’ve met them too,
Men of the lonely tracks.
Who carry a burden within their hearts
As well as upon their backs.
Men who were born of a blighted chance.
Who must struggle beneath the weight
Of a swag they have humped since the day of their birth,
The swag that is rolled by Fate.
“As ye sow, so ye reap,” the preacher says.
But there’s many a man I have known.
Who has reaped the husks from a harvest of oats
That other hands have sown.
The poets may sing of the glorious life,
Of the freedom beneath the stars.
Of the birds that you hear at the peep of day,
Though they’re mostly the crows and galahs.
They may sing of romance with a “bluey” up,
But their songs are beginning to sag;
There might be romance in a Lizzie at times.
But I’m damned if there is in a swag!—
With the ants and the flies as your only mates.
And they’ll stick to you close I’ll agree
As you nibble the edge of a “Johnny” that’s dry,
Like a bandicoot under a tree.
Then empty-gutted you cringe for a feed.
But you’re handed the “Douglas” instead.
So you mooch about like a hunted hound
Till you happen to fluke a shed.
But I did meet a happy bagman once.
It was somewhere out Hungerford way;
I think it was at the sixty-mile,
And he smiled as he said “Good-day.”


And all the time that he spoke he smiled,
No happier man than he,
As he counted five angels with mugs in their hands
Boozing-up under a tree.
And he said as he gazed at a Mulga clump,
“Did ever you see such things?
For I’ll be blowed if the one on the harp
Isn’t Barefooted Harry with wings.”
THE MICROBE ENGINEER
"VT’ES, mates, I’ve bumped some characters
Since I’ve been on the track,
You meet strange citizens, too right.
In these ’ere sheds outback.
But ’pon my soul the queerest cove
What I struck anywhere
Was Joseph Brown, what us blokes called
The microbe engineer.
He’s one of these ’ere poet coves,
At first you would surmise;
He’s long about the hair you know.
And dopey ’bout the eyes.
And yet he were no poet, mates;
He never seemed to care
A hang about the sheilas with
Their shining golden hair.
He’d sooner go out stalking worms
Or scratching after slugs.
Or get some pins and crucify
A regiment of bugs.


I’ve seen him up a lamp-post, mates,
’Bout twelve o’clock at night,
Lassooing moths and flying ants
What’s ’tracted hy the light.
I’ve known him walk for twenty miles
And go without a feed.
To trap some ants because their feet
Denote a different breed.
Yes, mates, he was a character,
There’s not the slightest doubt.
You’ve only got to meet him once
And then you’d find it out.
I’ll tell you now an incident
That happened unaware.
Before I knew the habits of
The microbe engineer.
I’m strolling through the bush one day.
You know just mooching round,
When suddenly I spots a cove
What’s rooting, up the ground.
Says I now what the devil is
The cause of all the fuss?
I wonder what’s his little game —
I think I’ll watch this cuss.
But ’pon my word I never sees
The likes in all my life,
Although I keep a batch of kids,
Me mother and me wife.
He seizes on a chunk of dirt,
A chucklin’ with delight.
His flamin’ hands were all ashake:
It’s true, mate, honour bright.
He whipped it up as though it were
A flamin’ five-quid note;
He puts it in a little box
And fairly starts to gloat.
D*
49


He’s struck the flamin’ opal mine
There isn’t any doubt;
It’s this ’ere patch I’ve often heard
The niggers talk about.
I watched him at his little game
For several hours I swear.
And when at last he gives a break
You bet I gives a cheer.
I swoops down, quite excited like,
And crying, “Well, ’ere goes!”
I used my hands for shovels, mates,
And works for all I knows.
I digs and digs and digs and digs.
Amongst the rocks and muck:
I turns a reg’lar quarry out.
But couldn’t strike no luck.
Yet still I keeps on digging, mate,
I never give up hope,
Till it grew dark and then, of course,
I had to do a slope.
But spare me days I hadn’t gone
A half a mile or more
When suddenly I spots his nibs
Arooting as before.
So to a flamin’ bush I sneaks
Ten yards from where he stood,
And kept me eyes upon him fixed
Like a detective would.
He soon whips up another lump,
Dissecting it with care;
I thought he’d found a diamond mine
To see his eyeballs glare.
I strains my eyes, for now, says I,
I’ve got him for a cert,
And watches ’im manipulate
That little lump of dirt.


But hold yer breath, mate, hold yer breath:
He gives that lump a rub,
And what yer think fell out? Can’t guess —
A dirty little grub.
A caterpillar, mind you, mate.
Without a word of lies,
A sort of microbe-looking thing
That hatches into flies.
It ain’t much use to say no more;
The oaths were rather blue;
Just buy a paper May the tenth,
That’s all you’ve got to do,
And read it till you come across,
The law or police court list.
And there you’ll find a lot about
Me and a naturalist.
Yes, mate, I’ve bumped some characters,
But never one, I swear.
As hard as I bumped Joseph Brown,
The microbe engineer.
MISS CALLAGHAN TRIES TO TEACH
ART AT LOUTH
TT was all in good faith that Miss Callaghan tried,
"*■ Though she failed in her purpose, it can’t be denied.
When she chose from her pupils a few whom she thought
To appreciate art in the nude might be taught.
So one evening she asked them when school had been
closed.
To enter her study, where beauty reposed
In the form of a Venus, the goddess of Love,
Attended by nymphs, with a Cupid above.
As addressing her pupils, she said with a smile,
“I want you to study this picture awhile,


Whose infinite beauty the poets extol.
And to tell me the way it appeals to your soul.”
The first to express his opinion was one.
Young Arty M’Pherson, the bank-teller’s son,
And, although he had come of a thoroughbred stock,
His opinion of art was a terrible knock
To his teacher, who looked as though tears she would shed,
When he stepped on the mat and unblushingly said,
“The one without duds ain’t a bad sort of bride;
But give me the tabby asleep by her side.”
“Take your hat up this instant,” Miss Callaghan said;
“You’re a bad-minded boy, and your soul is dead.”
So after young Arty had left in disgrace.
She picked upon one with a classical face;
But alas! once again she was doomed to despair,
For the youngster replied, as he fumbled his hair,
“If you want my opinion Miss, I’ll tell you what,
I reckon the picture’s inclined to be hot;
I might be mistaken, but in any case
I wouldn’t mind swopping young Cupid his place;
To my way of thinking I reckon it’s bonz.
But a word in your ear —keep it dark from the Johns.”
To an art connoisseur of the classical stock.
The youngster’s reply was a horrible knock;
So, blushing she handed him over his hat,
Exclaiming, “You wretched depraved little brat!”
At last in despair she called upon one,
Young Walter Silvester, the clergyman’s son,
In the hopes that it might be her fortune to find
One pupil at least with a classical mind;
As filled with emotion she gushingly said,
"“Note the glorious curves, and the poise of the head;
The symmetrical grace of a figure divine;
The entrancing perfection of every line
Of the Cupid that over the goddess kneels
And tell me what most to your soul appeals.”
But alas! for Miss Callaghan, fate was unkind,
For the lad whom she thought had a classical mind,
Replied with a smirk as he stepped off the mat,
“0-h, for gawd’s sake Miss Callaghan, chuck us me ’at.”


THE POMMY’S RETORT
TF ever a Lizzie was hopelessly bogged.
Our Lizzie was bogged that night.
With the front wheels down to the greasing caps,
The back ones out of sight.
You’d think we were helping to dig a grave.
Or trying to sink a tank,
For the more we tried to raise her up.
The deeper the old girl sank.
When a Pommy who happened to pass our way.
With a smile on his rosy face.
Made use of a phrase, that we thought, at the time.
Was uncalled for and quite out of place.
“Are ye bogged?” was the question he put to Blue,
A wag from the Dunlop shed,
Who, wearing a look of disgust on his face.
Glanced up at the Pommy and said;
“Oh, no, we’re not bogged, it’s only that Liz
At the rain storm has taken a fright,
And with instinct akin to a porcupine’s.
She’s burrowing out of sight.
“Whatever possessed you to think we were bogged?
When we’re only just waiting here
To draw a rough chart of the place where we think
Our Lizzie might disappear.
“Of course we’re not bogged; as a matter of fact
We’re out here enjoying the rain,
A sight that us people who live around Bourke
In our lives might not see again.”
It was here that the Pommy apologised,
As reflecting, he made retort:
“What ridiculous things we say at times.
And it’s just for the want of thought.


“Which reminds me; last night I was havin’ a meal.
When you, who I happened to see.
Remarked in a plausible sort of way,
‘Holloa! what, havin’ your tea?’
“Considering I be holdin’ a cup in my hand,
And a sandwich Ibe chewin’,
If I wasn’t havin’ my flamin’ tea
What the hell do ya think I be doin’?
“Which proves there are others, as well as myself.
Whom I think have need to be taught
Not to say stoopid things that they never would say.
Did they only but give it a thought.”


THE CHRIST BLOKE
HB ELL, I’ll have to hump it,”
jflHl ■■ HB the old man said,
I I “The same as I’ve done
As he gathered up his “home-
i sweet-home”,
To follow the sheds once
W MB
With a burden of forty pound all told,
And a dog pal by his side,
He struggled along to the five-mile peg
Though he faltered at every stride.
He slung it in at the ten-mile gate,
For we found him lying there,
Like the Pilgrim, that Bunyan wrote about,
In the Valley of Despair.


I know not whether ’twas willed by God,
Or whether ’twas only Fate,
But there happened along a Samaritan,
And he stopped at the ten-mile gate.
He wore the badge of some brotherhood;
I did not ask his creed,
But in the name of the Christ above,
He was a man indeed.
In his eyes was a splendour of kindly light,
A light such as one may see,
In the beautiful picture from Raphael’s brush,
Of the man from Galilee.
He placed a cup to the old man’s lips,
He gave him food to eat.
And he bandaged an open wound he found
On his sore and swollen feet.
And he waved his hand as he drove away,
And he said, “I will soon be back;
I’ve a few little things a man may need,
When he faces a lonely track.”
And the old man stood as a dog will stand,
Till his master is out of sight;
Then turning around he smiled and said,
“He’s a Christ Bloke, mate, too right.”
11.
It happened by mere coincidence,
The night we had mustered late.
That we came upon a dying man,
At the post near the stockyard gate.
So we carried him up to the drover’s camp.
Near the creek where the big bore drains.
And we lit a fire to try and warm
The blood in his frozen veins.
And at last he awoke, as a man will wake
From a slumber deep and sound.
And he started up with his arms outstretched
As he scanned the camp around.


And his eyes were ashine with a moisture bright
As he spoke these words to me,
“Matey, where is that Christ Bloke, eh?
It is him that I want to see.”
But he said no more, for his arms dropped down,
And his chin fell on his chest,
And we knew by the look in his vacant eyes.
He had found his long last rest.
We buried him at the break of day.
Though we had no pick nor spade,
So we chose a place where the ground was soft,
And a hole with our hands we made.
The only mourner the old man had.
Was a dog that whimpered low.
And whined as it hearkened to raucous cries
Of a black and hungry crow.
We placed at the head of his grave a swag,
At the foot a billy-can,
That a fellow mate, if he chanced to pass.
His resting place might scan.
111.
I have left the land where the gods are cruel.
This many and many a year,
Yet I often think of a lonely grave
As visions at times appear.
Once more I stand as the whirlies rise.
Like furies upon the plain.
Which I sometimes think are the souls of things
That have perished for want of rain;
And are soaring forever upwards
In a spiral towards the sky,
And are asking, forever asking
The gods for a reason why
They will not send down from their heavens
A soft and singing rain,
And give to the womb of a barren earth
A life force once again.


Anon and the vision changes,
The star of the morning wanes.
And I see, as in a procession.
The pilgrims of the plains.
I see them as onwards they straggle
With burdens upon the track;
Like snails who must carry ever
A home on a twisted back.
Not wanted and God-forsaken,
Each with his tale of woe.
Each with his arched back burdened
On . . on . . and on they go.
Once more and the scene has altered;
’Tis a star-girt Western night.
And I see by a camp-fire blazing,
An old man worn and white.
With his arms outstretched I see him.
As again he speaks to me,
“Matey, where is that Christ Bloke, eh?
It is him that I want to see.”


THE CRY OF THE MOTHERS
A S an artist would paint in colours,
So would I paint with pen,
A picture that features the burdens
Of the wives of Western men.
A picture, though crudely painted,
A moral might thus impart
By prompting the chords of pity
To tremble within the heart.
The scene is a Western homestead,
With sorrow upon the land.
For a tyrant that knows no mercy
Has crumbled the plains to sand.
All day on the sun-scorched ridges
In fury, the whirlies rise,
Spuming the red-soil debris
In columns towards the skies.
Remorseless, relentless, unsated,
With cymbals of bleaching bones.
The Drought King presses onward
To the dirge of dying groans.
The night is a night of anguish;
The moon through a tear-mist wanes.
As a mother beside a cradle
Is calling across the plains
To you, of the zephyred mountains,
You by the surf-sprayed shore.
Asking that you might help her
To succour the child she bore.
She asks of you not as a beggar.
Seeking the rich man’s gold.
For what she receives she returns you
In value a hundred-fold.


For she gives in repayment her children,
Who shall build you a mansion fair.
Whose toilings shall weave you a garment
Costly, that yon might wear.
For her babes shall be sowers and reapers
To labour at your command.
For yon city is but a harvest
Gleaned from the furrowed land.
And the man with the hoe forever
As tribute his toil must give.
That you who would dwell in mansions
By the sweat of his brow might live.
Still ever is heard the pleading.
Ever the sad refrain,
Of a Western mother calling
In anguish across the plain
To you, of the zephyred mountains.
You by the surf-sprayed shore.
Asking that you might help her
To succour the child she bore.
THE ROCKET CRICKET-BALL
“A BRAIN-WAVE is an ailment,”
I have often heard it said,
“That affects you in the night-time
As you lie awake in bed.
To which all men and women bora
Are subject more or less;
Sometimes they end in false alarm.
And sometimes in success.”


Cornelius Jones, a scientist.
The hero of my theme.
For fifteen years was captain of
The Bunyip Cricket Team.
He, too, had suffered from a wave.
But here I might remark
The wave from which he suffered was
A brain-wave with a spark.
The Dingos from Whoopwhala
Were a rival cricket team.
Whose ambition to be premiers
Had proved an empty dream.
Bronoski was the German
Who had given Jones the chat
About the mechanism of
An automatic bat —
A bat whose smooth and polished blade
A hidden spring possessed.
Arranged, so when you played the ball,
The spring would do the rest.
To lodge a protest there and then,
Cornelius never sought.
He argued that a double-cross
Occasioned better sport.
So was the brain-wave introduced.
To which I have referred.
That you perhaps will ridicule
And speak of as absurd.
A cell encased within a ball
Containing gelignite:
Percussion, when it strikes the bat,
To start it on a flight.
And though this little episode
I’ve fashioned into rhyme
Occurred a half a century
Before Don Bradman’s time.


Yet like gome by-gone incident.
Rehearsed within a dream
I view once more the triumph of
The Bunyip cricket team.
I see the Dingos win the toss.
As smiling with delight,
Per medium of their auto bat.
They score from left to right.
Whilst Slogger Jim from Boolooroo
Puts records in the shade
By scoring half a century off
The automatic blade.
I see Stonewaller Williams, who
For weeks had failed to score,
In half an over knock to leg
A sixer and a four.
The look upon the captain’s face,
The haughty way he posed.
As when a century was scored.
Declared the innings closed.
I see the Bunyips follow on
As fast their wickets fall.
Until Cornelius with a smile
Rings in the rocket-ball.
I see Bronoski play the ball.
As bidding it good-bye,
He waves a hand on watching it
Approach towards the sky.
I see the consternation of
The spellbound gaping crowd,
As like a speck the rocket-ball
Is seen against a cloud.
Once more I hear the local sports
As loudly they applaud.
For ere the rocket-ball was found
A century was scored.


And now as oft I read about
The records Bradman’s made,
Bronoski’s century-drive I think
Must put them in the shade.
Although there’s this much to be said.
That Bradman, after all.
Has never had the chance to play
A rocket cricket-ball.
IN MEMORIAM: BARE-FOOTED HARRY
"DARE-FOOTED HARRY has slung it in,
Said cheerio to this world of sin;
Taken a lead to the Other Side,
Humped it across the Great Divide
To mix it with angels upon the wing.
Where a hand-out consists of a halo ring.
So here’s to you, Harry, and may you dwell
At peace with old comrades in Heaven or Hell,
And, if those rare poesies beyond the sky
Hold referendums that vote them dry.
May some cobber with wings who has humped it Out West
Bribe Peter to wink at a flask of the best.*
♦ Bare-footed Harry: Harry Rice, now dead, a well-known identity in and
around Bourke, who had hia nick-name from hia determined habit of going boot-
less. This habit came about in a tragic way: When he was a young man his
wife died by drowning, and he was unable to save her because of being unable
to remove his boots. He thereafter took a vow never to wear boots again, and
was to be seen, in all weathers, going barefooted along the scorching roads, or
along the river bank, which he frequented in the hope that he might one day
save another from the fate his young wife had met.
THE RETORT TACITURN
T CANNOT say I much admire
The one whose jawbones seldom tire
Of cracking chestnuts you have heard,
That were in Noah’s time interred.


And yet upon the other hand,
I can’t appreciate the brand
Of individual, whose retort
Is limited to phrases short;
Who with a cautious hesitation,
Abbreviates his conversation.
The other day I chanced to meet
The very type in Oxford Street;
The weather being rather hot
I asked him if he’d like a spot:
He cleared his voice and smiling said,
.... “I would.”
And then, to further entertain,
I said the heat should end in rain:
He glanced towards the sky and said,
.... “It should.”
And then to try and draw him out,
I ventured on another bout;
I harped on Stevens, Bruce and Lang,
As well as on the razor-gang;
I said that things seemed in a mess,
And never would improve, unless
The bankers made the interest low;
And that the dole would have to go.
He cleared his voice once more and said,
. . . . “You’re right.”
I then remarked that Stevens may
Improve conditions in a way;
He blew a whiff of smoke and said,
. . . . “He might.”
And then to try a likely stunt,
I asked him did he ever punt;
He blew another whiff of smoke and said,
.... “I do.”
I named a prad I heard was slick.
Remarking cups were hard to pick;
He coughed to clear his voice and said,
.... “That’s true.”
Disgusted then, I chose a course
In hopes an argument to force;


Of liaisons and rare delights.
In hopes for me he might unroll
The red-typed issues of his soul.
I made inquiry whether he
Had worshipped at Love’s sanctuary;
He hesitated for a while,
Then, answering with a cynic smile.
He blew a cloud of smoke and said,
“Too right.”
So seeing that my time was spent
In vain to force an argument,
I cranked my Lizzie up and said,
“Good-night.”
“I’ll see you ’gain some other day,”
I added in an off-hand way;
He proffered me his hand and said,
“You might.”
THE TWO LANDS
A S tribute to a bard that now
Has joined the voiceless throng.
Who caught the spirit of the bush
And rhymed it into song,
"Who found within the bell-birds’ notes
“A tender, touching theme,”
And sang in subtle sweetness of
The valley, hill and stream —
In honour of this bard, I ask
Of those who understand,
'When singing of our forest shore
To call it Kendall’s land,


In contrast to another land,
Where, with a rougher pen,
A gipsy rhymer paused to sing
The songs of outcast men.
And in respect of him, I ask
Of those who understand.
When singing of our great Far West,
To call it Lawson’s land.
THE FLOWERS OF THE WEST
r I THOUGH bards may sing of red-lipped love.
In lingering refrains,
I crave the gift to paint in words
The marvels of the plains.
For have I seen the Western land
Like fields of rippling com,
The tasseled spear-grass as a sea
Pulsating with the dawn.
And in the spring the purple blooms,
Aroused from drought’s repose,
Yield up a fragrance rarer than
The perfume of a rose.
The low-lands, with the azure bells,
In such profusion spread.
It seemed that they had borrowed tints
From blue skies overhead;
A coverlet of xanthic bloom
Appearing after rain.
As if the gold from sunset sky
Was spilt upon the plain.


And when the moon through drifts of clouds
Her dream-soft shadows throws.
The everlasting daisies mass
Like drifts of virgin snows.
And e’en though I have loitered long
Spell-bound in ecstasy,
To drink the beauty of a land
Bloom-tinted by the seas,
And gazed from Cardwell’s palm-crowned heights
On Hinchinbrook below,
Where islets rising from the sea
In tropic grandeur show,
Yet never sight more beautiful
My memory retains,
Than visions of a land that slept.
Awakened by the rains.
THE DEATH OF LAUGHING-EYES
TTUSH! hush! tread lightly, lift aside the veil,
Speak low and tender-wise,
For there beneath the fragrance of the flowers.
Sleeps Laughing-Eyes.
All night I’ve watched him, placing one by one
The perfume-laden petals to his lips,
Thinking perchance, though motionless they be,
The mind may still a consciousness retain.
And ’neath the veil of endless slumber feel
The pressing sweetness of each fragrant bloom.
Within the East the world awakes once more;
Night’s eyes are dimmed save for one peerless orb
Hung jewel-like in silvern tapestry.
Where dawn red-lipped exultantly awaits
In amorous expectancy the day
As from the open lattice echoes forth
A rhapsody of love-thrilled happy birds
That Laughing-Eyes shall never wake to hear.


The rose of dawn has blossomed on the plain;
And from the fount of memory there flows
A stream of fancies wrought from having once
Gazed on a picture from Correggio’s brush
Of happiness, seen in semblance of a child
With lips apart smiling through rifts of clouds.
Dreams build on dreams, as sound re-echoes sound.
And to the one who wakes from trembling strings.
Reflections of the soul, themes build on themes;
And this I know, that there will come to me
Oft-times at night, when, in her truancy,
The errant mind explores the land of dreams,
An angel-vision like Correggio’s child.
When I shall see once more, though through tear-mists,
Smiling from rifts of those dawn-tinted clouds,
. . . . The face of Laughing-Eyes.
THE DREAM LOVER
TTE hearkened not to subtle strain
■ a " B ' Of Dionysian minstrelsy.
Nor would he choose a Nereid’s song
Aeolian-wafted o’er the sea.
He saw the bridegroom enter in
The curtained chamber of delight;
The maiden blushes of the bride
As dreaming of the nuptial night.
A manuscript bedimmed by tears
He would not to the world unroll;
It was the sea alone that heard
The silent sobbings of his soul.
And oft at times, on moon-stilled nights,
Beside the everlasting sea.
In dreams Orpheus-like he wooed
Once more a lost Eurydice.


LIFE IS SHORT
HTHE bride of life has beckoned you
With full lips kissing-red,
A Venused dove is hovering
Above the nuptial bed.
The grapes are pressed, the vintage yours.
If you life’s joys would taste,
A dawn thrush in an arbour cries,
“Make haste, make haste, make haste!”
There’s many a soul that’s bom to sing
And yet is doomed to die.
Because in dreams it paused to hear
The song of bye-and-bye.
Unloose the chains that bind you down,
Unbar the prison gate
Before the Reaper’s voice is heard,
“Too late, too late, too late!”
THE SACRIFICE
T OVE came unashamed in his nakedness
One day when the world began,
And a naiad, lily-breasted, danced
To the pure reed notes of Pan,
And rare was love,
And fair was love.
As the Christ-child seen at rest.
Whom Raphael has painted with lips apart
Asleep on the Virgin’s breast.
Love came again when the world was aged,
And the naiad’s blood was shed,
And a white dove, crimson-breasted, sang
A requiem overhead.
As there, defamed,
Creed-cursed and maimed.
Beside his native sea.
Love trembling stood, by priest condemned,
A thing of blasphemy.


SONG
A H, love, how like a flower
That blossoms with the dawn;
How soon the night approaches,
And leaves the heart forlorn.
Ah, love, if thou wert only
Resplendent in thy might,
As peerless and as steadfast
As stars unto the night.
But love, thou’rt just a flower,
A blossom of the day.
And ere the evening cometh
Thy beauty fades away.
THE FLOWER-CHILD
A S fancies go Gipsy-roving
Over the fields of thought,
I loiter before a picture
In colours sublimely wrought;
The face of a child by Correggio
Cast in the love-god’s pose.
Yet as pure as the prisoned petals
In the heart of a budding rose.
And as fancy goes still aroving
Into the realms of dreams;
In visions I see Correggio
Planning his colour schemes;
As choosing from pansy petals
The tints of the seas and skies.
He features the soul of a seraph
Basking in Cupid’s eyes.


And surely from clouds dawn-tinted,
Mary of Heaven smiled
When lo! on an artist’s panel
There blossomed a flower-child.
AMOR IMMORTALIS
QOFT as stars at wane-time.
Gentle as a fawn,
Fair as is a dream-child
Slumbering with the dawn.
Seen in beast with soul-eyes.
As it still remains
Watching o’er an offspring,
Dead upon the plains.
Heard from trees at mate-time,
When by zephyr stirred
Notes of passion echo
From a love-thrilled bird.
E’en the smallest blossoms
That the eyes oft shun—
Love-things are coquettish,
Flirting with the sun.
Panther-fierce, and tender
As a cooing dove;
Like the stars immortal
Reigns immortal love.


BABY THINGS
TF7HILST the bower-birds are building,
Mary ’neath a willow sings.
By the lake at Lower Lila,
Thirty miles from Lila Springs;
Knitting, knitting, gladly knitting
Dainty, soft, white baby things.
’Twas a Diamentina drover
Saw the beauty of her face.
Held her as she vainly struggled,
Weeping, in his strong embrace.
Said that he was soon returning
With a herd from Queensland side;
Mary kissed him as they parted—
Kissed the one whose lips had lied.
Now the bower-birds have mated,
Mary broken-hearted sings,
By the lake at Lower Lila,
Thirty miles from Lila Springs;
Knitting, knitting, sadly knitting,
Soft, white, tear-stained baby things.
THE WOOD-DUCK AND THE HUNTER
as if wounded
To distract the eye
From thy babes in hiding
’Mongst the reeds hard by,
Seemest thou a Christ-thing
With a spark divine,
Love that’s all-consuming
Surely must be thine.
Unafraid and dauntless,
Thou, it seems, would give
Life, as would a martyr.
That thy babes might live.


I who am a hunter.
Up in yonder town,
For thy hapless carcase
Might be paid a crown.
Why should I, a hunter.
For the sake of pelf,
Rob the world of something
Nobler than myself?
Go, thou love-thrilled creature,
Join thy happy brood.
Overwhelmed with rapture
Of sweet motherhood.
Live the life God gave thee.
As thou hast before;
I, who was a hunter,
Hunter am no more.
THE AGE OF INNOCENCE
TTAPPY little fellow.
Smiling all flay long,
Happy as a dawn-thrush
Bursting into song:
Finding in your play-world
Something ever new.
Happy little fellow.
How I envy you.
Old, decrepit, blase,
Derelict, alone,
Reaping sheaves of sorrow
From the seed I’ve sown.
I have one ambition
As I see you there.
Rosy-faced and happy
Without pain or care:


’Tis for one bright hour
Neath a sky of blue.
Just to be a happy
Little fellow, same as you.
Now the game seems over.
Now that life seems done.
Like a flower shutting
With the setting sun;
Every idol shattered.
Every castle down;
Face that once was dimpled.
Wearing now a frown;
As the blood runs colder.
Sluggish in its course,
Comes the demon, ever.
Of a great remorse:
As life’s tide is ebbing
With declining years.
Dreams of happy childhood
Fill the eyes with tears;
Seems it is the thought that
Now the game is through,
“X was once a happy
Little fellow, same as you.”


AN INFERENCE
\V7HEN Dr. Aesculapius
T His wisdom would impart.
He taught that all the joys of life
Sprang upwards from the heart.
But in respect to birds and beasts,
His argument must fail.
For in their case it would suggest
That joy sprang from the tail.
The Wagtail in the early mom
Rejoicing on a rail.
Suggests that life’s ecstatic joys
Are surging in his tail.
Just stroke young Fido on the head
And you will quickly find
That when he starts rejoicing
He rejoices from behind.
So if to please your Thomas cat.
Like methods you employ,
You’ll find his comprehensive tail
A mass of twirling joy.
The Peacocks, with their plumes outstretched
Like ships with painted sails,
Suggest the joys of Paradise
Are centred in their tails.
Though but a mere hypothesis
The truth may yet prevail
That man much happier would have been
Had he possessed a tail.


NURSERY RHYMES
O, little Boy Blue, Mow away at your horn.
It’s your music we’re wanting to-day;
V jCj And little 80-Peep, go muster your sheep
■ r 1 ') For it seems they are going astray.
I Y And ever the world will swing to a song
V} K 1 Of lovers beneath the moon;
Yet a happy world is this world forsooth
When it swings to a cradle tune.


And the sweetest of songs are ever those
That are written in simplest lays.
The nursery rhymes that with lisping lips
We learnt in our childhood days.
And ever the thoughts are sorrow-sweet
To the one who, a whole night through,
Has fondled the tresses that clustered around
The face of his little Boy Blue.
And I doubt not that if in the after years
He hearkened to music sweet.
No notes to him were as beautiful
As the patter of two small feet.
And the music they made on the play-house floor.
In a world full of wonders new,
That swung to the tune of a nursery rhyme.
From the lips of a little Boy Blue.


THE KISS I GAVE LYNETTE
"WTHEN I was young,
’ T And highly strung,
I sever shall forget.
One frosty night
When stars were bright.
The kiss I gave Lynette.
It was a most inspiring kiss,
A wonderful, deep-desiring kiss,
A four plugs, all of them firing, kiss,
The kiss I gave Lynette.
’Twas a sort of a drink with a bite kiss,
A wish it could last for the night kiss,
A better put out the light kiss.
The kiss I gave Lynette.
It was anything but a shy kiss,
’Twas a one perpetual sigh kiss,
A let me stop here till I die kiss.
The kiss I gave Lynette.
’Twas a kind of a hot-shot burning kiss,
A take you to Heaven, soul-yeaming kiss,
A decidedly well worth learning kiss.
The kiss I gave Lynette.
She left me that night with heart-burnings.
And a soul that was brimful of yearnings,
And although I was minus my earnings,
I never shall forget.
One frosty night
When stars were bright.
The kiss I gave Lynette.


WHEN MARY LAUGHS
VV7HEN Mary laughs the spiders fall
” In consternation from the wall,
And babies from their cradles crawl.
When Mary laughs.
When Mary laughs the goats refuse
To give their milk, and stem folk lose
Their solemn looks, when down the lane
Is heard the lingering refrain
Of Mary’s laugh.
When Mary laughs the roosters crow.
The dogs begin to bark as though
Someone had let them in the know.
When Mary laughs.
I sometime think should Mary die
And get a possie in the sky
The white-washed saints would cock their ears
And twang their harps and give three cheers,
When Mary laughs.
THE PASSING
OONGS of the birds o’erhead,
Just a little while, such a little while.
Songs of the birds are dead.
Spring and the fields aglow.
Just a little while, such a little while,
Winter, the frost, and snow.
Dimples and golden hair.
Just a little while, such a little while,
Sorrow and blinding tear.
Dawn and a day begun,
Just a little while, such a little while,
Night, and a day is done.
