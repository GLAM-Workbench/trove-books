Description of the Copper Stratum in Aniseed Valley, Nelson.
The Copper Stratum in Aniseed Valley was discovered in 1878 by Messrs,
./ohnston, and is hence called “Johnston’s Copper ‘ Stratum. ” It was first
found in the centre of the belt of Serpentine Rock, known as the Mineral Belt,
in the immediate vicinity of a former chrome ore working.
The copper-bearing stratum runs in the same direction as the surrounding
serpentine rock, of which it is only a portion, but in its northerly course it is
interrupted by a mass of volcanic breccia, from which possibly its contents of copper
may have originated.


The copper occurs in a native state almost equally interspersed through the
whole mass to a thickness of about 8 feet. The stratum has been traced, copper-
bearing, for a length of 250 feet, the average contents being 5 to 6 per cent, of
copper, disseminated through the mass in minute irregular grains.
In the natural cleavages of the rock constituting this stratum, the copper js
not visible, and it can only be seen in a fracture made across the grain, which
makes it difficult to trace on the surface, and which will probably account for this
deposit not having been previously observed.
The great practical value of the stratum consists in the facility with which
the copper can be extricated, inasmuch as nearly the whole of the grains of metal
can be panned off from the pounded mass, as easily as gold can be panned from
crushed quartz, and it can consequently be saved by a crushing machine
similarly to gold, or rather, similarly to tin or lead ore as treated in Europe.
At present the proprietors are endeavouring to open up the stratum in its
southern continuation, and are also making a cart road to it, with a view to its
eventual working on a large scale.

Building Stones of Canterbury.
The building stones of Canterbury are principally derived from two very
distinct sources, of which the first, furnishing free-stones of excellent quality and
generally of considerable hardnsss, is of volcanic origin.


These arc mostly obtained from Banks’ Peninsula, and are probably of middle
tertiary age. The rest of the building stones, mostly of a calcareous nature, are
derived from the upper portion of two well defined sedimentary deposits, named
the Waipara and Oamaru formations, the first being of cretaceo-tertiary, and the
latter of upper eocene or lower miocene age. The hard building stones of volcanic
origin quarried in Banks’ Peninsula are derived either from basaltic lava streams,
in which case they are generally used for rubble and for dressed ashlar work, or
they are taken from dykes generally of a trachytic character. These dyke rocks
for every kind of architectural work are very useful, and form in many instances
beautiful building stones of rich colour and fine texture.
The calcareous sandstones usually called limestones are of light colours, from
brownish-grey to a creamy white, and of a varying degree of hardness, but they
can all be cut with a saw w r hen taken from the quarry. Afterwards they gradually
become much harder when being exposed to the air, an excellent quality for a
building stone of that class. An almost unlimited supply of this building material
can be obtained.

The Towai (Weinmannia racemosa) is an indigenous tree largely distributed
over the hilly lands in many parts of New Zealand ; it is often to be met with
four or five feet in diameter, and from thirty to sixty feet in height. It grows
frequently in clusters united at the base in a large tabular stoloniferous root, and
in numerous instances round Mount Egmont the tree forms a natural bridge over
the stream, as it first grows upright on the bank, and then gradually inclines over
until its top reaches the land on the other side, there it rests, a forest of young
trees springing up vertically from the prostrate trunk. A zone of thirty miles,
three miles in width round the high lands of Mount Egmont is clothed exclusively
with Towai, whilst throughout the whole district the banks of most of the rivers
will yield a large supply. A reference to the map will show the distribution. The
Extract is unusually rich in Tannin and forms good leather, and as a dye will
jield all the shades obtainable from Gunbier. It can be cheaply rendered.
In case B the first four Extracts are astringent of greater or less value.
No. 11.—Hinau (Elceocarpus Dentatus)is of sufficient importance to deserve a
rg’ e ial notice.
(12)


The Hinau is an evergreen forest tree of considerable dimensions. The bark
is used by the natives in dyeing black their beautiful flax mats. The flax after
a soaking in a hot fusion of the bark is buried for a time in the red iron mud
so abundant in the stagnant pools. The Hinau can only be considered of value
as a dye, yielding yellow buffs and blacks.
No. 12.—1 s an Extract of the Pukatea (Atherosperma Novae Zealandae). It
is a valuable tonic, much in use amongst the Maoris as a remedy for neuralgia.
In selecting a tree for stripping, they always take one that has been exposed to
the fullest effects of the sun’s rays.

This Machine could be used to compress air, to drive an Air

would be made in the forward motion by the irregularity
of the waves. With a cylinder 20-ft. in diameter and 18-ft.
wave per minute, the machine would be equal to 19 horse
power, and with 3 waves per minute, each 5-ft. it would

Breakwaters. —The Breakwaters are formed of nibble stone blasted from the
Quarries at Naval and Officer’s Points, and deposited on the respective sites as
shewn in the model—the outer slopes of both Breakwaters are protected or faced
with huge blocks of stone. The Officer’s Point, or Eastern Breakwater, is some
2,010 feet in length, with a width of 40 feet on top, and having an elevation of 6
feet above high water spring tide. The Naval Point Breakwater is 1,400 feet ia
length. The former breakwater has also a timber breastwork built along its inner
face for nearly its entire length—known as the Gladstone Pier.
Water Area Enclosed. —The area of water enclosed within the Breakwaters is
about 110 acres.
Dredging. —Dredging operations have been proceeding almost uninterruptedly
for the past three years, during which period 756,090 cubic yards, or 1,049,725
tons of dredged material, consisting of stiff clay and mud, have been removed, at an
average cost of 6|d. per cubic yard. The Dredging plant used has been a single
