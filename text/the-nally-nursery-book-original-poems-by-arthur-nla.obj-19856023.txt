FLIPPITY, FLOPPITY, FLUMP!
HOP! SKIP!! JUMP!!!
THAT S how old man Kangaroo
Goes leaping through the bush.
He doesn t walk like me and you;
He gives himself a push,
A sort of flip, a kind of kick,
That sends him speeding past.
I wonder where he learned the trick
Of travelling so fast.
FLIPPITY. FLOPPITY, FLUMP!
HOP! SKIP!! JUMP!!!
Now one thing you must never do
Out in the bush, or in the Zoo:
You must not tease the Kangaroo.
He 11 do no harm to me and you,
Unless some very naughty child
Pokes sticks at him and makes him wild.
But if he does get really riled.
Run home as quickly as you can,
Because he s far more dangerous than
You would suppose. He’ll fight a man!
He stands upon his tail so thick,
And with his hind-foot, oh! so quick,
He aims a dreadful, ripping kick.
So don’t forget, whate’er you do,
You must not tease the Kangaroo.
FLIPPITY, FLOPPITY, FLUMP!
HOP! SKIP!! JUMP!!!


THE BOTTLE-OH MAN
Old Bones-and-Bottles is a raggedy man.
He likes hot chips and kippers.
He has a horse and wobbly van,
And wears old carpet slippers.
Old-Bones-and-Bottles has a jolly shout,
And pulls such funny faces:
“Hi! Bring your bones and bottles out!
As past old Piebald paces.
Old-Bones-and-Bottles is my favourite man,
Although he’s old and dusty.
He lets me hang behind his van:
I’m not a cowardy-custy!
I’m going to be a Bottle-Oh man,
And keep a growly pup;
I’ll have a horse and wobbly van,
So there! when I grow up.

“Sambo, Sambo,
Have you any wool?”
“Yes, sir; Yes, sir,
Three bags full.”
“Sambo, Sambo,
Where do you keep
Your rams and lambs,
And Woolly sheep?”
“Nowhere, Nowhere,”
Sambo said.
“I grow it all
Upon my head
For nigger boys
Have lots of wool
Instead of Fair
To keep them cool.”
“Sambo, Sambo,
That’s a tale.
If you’re found out
You’ll go to gaol!
Sambo, Sambo,
Go to bed,
Or I’ll tell your mummy
What you said.”

Mary had some Nally Ware
Which would not crack or break,
And everywhere that Mary went
Her Nally she would take.
She took it to the school one day,
Which teacher let her do.
The children clapped their hands and cried:
“We want some Nally, too!”

Topsy! Turvy!
Mrs. Murphy
“Hurvy! Scurvy!”
Cried Mrs. Murphy,
And got a great, big stick.
She went whack! whack!
Rode a pig to town.
The piggy stopped,
So down she flopped
On piggy’s back
And tumbled on the ground
For playing such a trick.
“Topsy! Turvy!
Mrs. Murphy.”
Said piggy, “You won’t fall,
For I’ll be good,
As piggies should,
And never stop at all!”

Let’s go down
And see the birdie’s nest again.
Teeny-weeny-tiny-toe!
Into this wee sock you go.
Now your shoes, and off we run,
Looking everywhere for “fun.”
Little feet,
Light and fleet,
Romping gaily down the street;
Peeking here,
Peeping there,
Tripping along without a care!
we can sit beneath this tree
Where, gazing upwards, we can
see
The sun play “80-peep” with
the leaves,
As in and out each shadow
weaves.
Here we stay
While you play
In and out
And round about.
We’re having lots of fun to-day I
Teeny-weeny-tiny-toe!
Back across the field we go.
In my arms you take your rest,
Light as laughter on my breast
Little feet,
You’ ve had your treat.
Off comes little baby frock;
Off comes shoe; off comes sock,
And into bed again you go,
Teeny-weeny-tiny-toe!

A FEW FAMOUS AUSTRALIANS
The knobbly, wobbly, queer goanna
Crawls round in a peculiar manner.
No other land the wide world through
Can boast a native kangaroo.
Where other birds would sing a song,
Our “Jacko” chuckles loud and long.
He’s rarely seen and makes no fuss;
The shy and timid platypus.
He doesn’t like it if you boss him.
Our independent little possum.
In city streets or bushlands fair
The favourite Aussie’s Nally Ware.

Cinderella’* Birtcr* com* back from the ball.


Once upon a time there wi
J r K 7c A sweet and humble little maid,
[/( Who toiled all day and never played.
jW2|/ She swept the floor, the ashes sieved,
— So that the cinders she’d retain,
To use upon the fire again.
And so, because her name was “Ella,”
Her sisters called her “Cinder-Ella.”
These sisters were grown up, but she
Was just a little maid, you see.
She never had nice clothes to wear;
She had no ribbons in her hair.
The dress by Cinderella worn,
Was old and raggedy and torn.
But they were gowned in gorgeous clothes,
With frills and silk and satin bows;
Pag* Tlurt*«a


In lovely colours: blue and yellow,
And green and lilac, white and rose —-
But never a one for Cinderella.
They treated her most cruelly,
And overworked her shamefully,
And oft-times they would shout and bellow
“Come here at once, you, Cinderella!
Take off my shoes,” or “hook this up,” or
“Don’t be so slow! Now get the supper!”
And tho’ she worked all day and tried
To do her very best, they cried:
“How can you be so tiresome, child!”
For they were always cross and riled.
Indeed, my dear, you should be glad
That you such sisters never had.
One day the King, who ruled that land,
Decided he would have a grand
Court Ball in honour of his son,
And ordered that it should be done.
So forth the invitations went,
And Royal Couriers were sent
To bid the lords and gentlefolk.
This is the message that they spoke:
“Oyezl Oyez r His Majesty
His Royal Greeting now doth send
Commanding that you do attend
And grace the King’s festivity,”
Pag* Fotrtoea


This message, which the heralds bore,
Was brought to Cinderella’s door.
Then what a fluster! What a flurry!
All was excitement, fuss and hurry.
The sisters dressed up for the ball,
And off they drove, nor thought at all
Of little Cinderella, weeping;
So sad of heart, so tired of sweeping.
But suddenly she raised her eyes,
And there beheld, with glad surprise,
Her fairy godmother appear,
Who smiled and said, “Now, now, my dear
You must not cry, for I am here.
And it is my most pleasant task
To give you ANYTHING you ask.’’
Then Cinderella answered: “All
I ask is just to see the ball.
I’d only take a tiny peep,
And then back home I’d softly creep.’’
With looks of love the fairy smiled.
“You are a sweet, unselfish child.
You could have asked for many things
For coaches, horses, jewels, rings,
But did not. Therefore, you shall be
Clothed as a princess royally.
And you shall have your coach-and-four
To drive up to the King’s own door.
Page Fifteen


Now fetch a pumpkin here to me,
And fairy magic you shall see.’’
The pumpkin brought, she waved her wand
And, lo! there stood a coach so grand.
Four timid mice crept through a crack:
She waved again, and in a trice
Those teeny-weeny little mice
Were turned to horses tall and black.
And after that she made a rat
Into a coachman fine and fat.
Then over Cinderella’s head
She held her wand: behold! instead
Of rags, her gown is rich and fine,
While jewels on her fingers shine,
And two glass slippers on her feet
Look most adorable and neat.
“Now go,” the fairy mother said,
“With all my blessings on your head.
One thing, dear Cinderella, you
Must be particular to do:
You must be back by twelve o’clock.
For as the hour of midnight chimes
Your coach and horses, coachman, frock,
Will vanish, so be home betimes.”
So Cinderella promised she v
Would mind this warning carefully.
Into her lovely coach she stepped:
The horses pranced, then off they swept.
Paga Sixtaea


They swung into the palace-yard,
Saluted by the King’s Own Guard.
Wide swing the doors of that great hall,
And while she strives in vain to quell a
Throbbing dear Cinderella
Beholds at last the Royal Ball!
Arrayed in all her dazzling clothes
She enters. Lords and ladies bow
And, wondering, tell each other how
Lovely she is. But no one knows
The Fairy Godmother appears to Cinderella.
P«Q« Smaoteen


This is the lonely little maid,
Who in the kitchen always stayed.
But now, ’tis true the grandest there
In admiration stand and stare
To see this radiant beauty pass.
“Oh, look! her slippers are of glass!”
They cry aloud, and nudge each other.
“Who knows this princess? Who’s her
Who is her father, sister, brother?”
They gaze at her bewilderedly,
But none can tell who she may be.
The gallant prince, the monarch’s son,
For whom these revels were begun,
Sees her. At once his heart is won.
Now, fife and drum,
Euphonium,
Horn, clarinet,
And flageolet
The revellers greet
With music sweet,
While harp and tabor
In concord labour
With violins
And violoncello.
The dance begins,
And Cinderella
With loving glance
The Prince commands
To lead the dance.
Page Eligbtoe®


Then clasping hands,
The Prince and she
In minuet
Bow low and sway
So gracefully.
And here and there,
And everywhere
The whispered news creates a stir:
“The Prince has fallen in love w\th her!
Tho’ flushed with joy she keeps in mind
She must be gone ere midnight chime
A quarter-hour before that time
She hastes away and leaves behind
The music, dancing, joyous play,
Although she dearly longs to stay.
Swiftly she hurries from the ball.
The Prince himself, leaving the hall,
Escorts her to her coach-and-four,
And stands beside her carriage door.
He begs she will his heart delight
By coming on the morrow night,
When there will be another Ball.
She looks at him so handsome, tall;
So strong and slim
And debonair,
That I declare
She finds herself in love with him.
Page Ninete«»


With beating heart and glances bright,
She promised to be there next night.
At midnight dress and silken train,
Coach, horses, all from mortal sight
Vanish, and she’s in rags again.
Next night the fairy mother came,
And horses, coachmen; all the same
As had been done the night before,
With magic art she made once more.
Then Cinderella to the hall
Is driven and dances at the ball.
Once more the lords and ladies bow;
Again they tell each other how
Lovely she is. Still no one knows
Whence she comes, or whither she goes
The Prince, forgetting royal pride,
A humble lover at her side
All evening stays, and she is thrilled.
With love and joy the hours are filled
So much, that she forgets the time.
But hark! the bells begin to chime!
Poor Cinderella, with a shock,
Discovers it is twelve o’clock!
Ere they cease tolling, in dismay
She turns and swiftly runs away,
And rushing through the palace door,
Pago Twe aty


Trying on the Glass Slipper.
Just gains the darkness of the night
As fairy gifts all fade from sight.
But in the hurry of her flight,
She leaves upon the ballroom floor
One of her slippers made of glass,
Whose beauty few things could surpass.
And now the Prince’s joy and gladness
Are turned to sorrow, gloom and sadness
He’ s in despair to know how she
Could vanish so mysteriously
Pag* Tvr*nty-o«e


He cannot learn where she may be,
Nor find one thing to ease his heart,
For no one saw her coach depart.
He sends the Royal Heralds forth —
To east and west, to south and north.
This public cry they are to make
(He bade them, too, the slipper take) :
“Oyez! Oyez! Our Prince doth swear
The maid who can this slipper wear,
So that it jits her perfectly,
His princess and his bride shall be ”
To each and every house they went
Until their strength was nearly spent,
But could not find a maid to claim
This rich reward. At last they came
To Cinderella’s house and there,
Seated in turn upon a chair,
Tis laughable to see her sisters
Tugging and straining and raising blisters
Upon their heels, as there they sit,
Trying to make the slipper fit.
At last they sulkily admit
Their feet are much too big for it.
Then Cinderella’s asked to don
The slipper. When she tries it on
Of course it fits her like a glove.
The maid who won their Prince’s love
Page Twenty-two


They’ve found, so they are overjoyed.
At first the sisters are annoyed,
But soon they’re shivering with fright.
For they are in a sorry plight.
They fear that Cinderella, since
She is about to wed the Prince,
Will tell him of their cruelty,
And probably on him prevail
To put them both for years in gaol.
They do not realise that she
Is far above such petty spite,
And knows revenge is never right.
Look! In their midst a smoke-cloud rears!
The fairy god-mother appears.
She smiles and says, “All’s well, my dears
This princeling is a gallant fellow,
And fit to wed our Cinderella.’’
At this the Heralds laugh, but she
Turned on them with severity,
And stared until she made them wince.
“Perhaps you think your noble Prince
Too good for her,’’ she said. “Well, you
Have made a very big mistake.
For if a maid be good and true,
She well deserves her place to take
As princess at the Royal board.
For virtue has the power to make
Her nobler than a prince or lord."
P aja Twenty tLroa


Her magic wand she raises high.
Swift as the winking of an eye
A stately coach and horses stand,
With footmen dressed in livery grand,
While Cinderella’s rags and tatters
Are turned to clothes and jewels rare.
She steps, so radiant and fair,
Into the coach, and off it clatters.
Ahead the Heralds gallop fast
To tell the Prince she’s found at last.
Then Prince and courtiers for her wait.
They meet her at the palace gate,
And lead her in with regal state.
All tears and trials now are fled.
The Prince and Cinderella wed
’Midst pealing bells, rejoicings, laughter,
And they live happy ever after.

Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum,
I’m a pirate. Here I come
In my ship, the “Betsy Jane,”
Sailing on the Spanish Main.
When I board a galleon,
That s the time to shoot my gun.
BANG! BANG! What lots of fun
Til the foemen yield and run
And the battle has been won.
Hoist our colours to the sky.
Skull and cross-bones waving high
Warn all other ships to fly.
When to escape the cowardies try,
I chase and fight them till they die.
Now my flag I’ve got to lower.
Furl my sail, and fight no more.
There’s my mummy at the door.
A bold, bad pirate I can be
No longer now because, you see,
I HAVE to go and get my tea.

Simple Simon
Met a Pieman
Going to the Fair
Said Simple Simon
To that Pieman,
“Help me buy some ware.”
Said the Pieman
To Simple Simon,
“No need to shilly-shally,
Or question why;
The ware to buy
Is genuine, branded Nally!”
Why is genuine Nally Ware so excellent for children’s use?
It is so strong.
It gives such lasting wear.
It is germ-proof.

It is made from hygienic materials.
The child loves the bright, vivid colours.
The colours are not applied, and do not come off.
It will not break, crack or chip unless treated

It is so light: little more than half the weight of

When little fairies clear a space
And gambol up and down,
The queerest, tricksy things take place
While you’re in Slumber Town.
Their dresses are designed by Puck,
And every seam and hem.
As well as every tiny tuck.
Pine-needles sew for them.
A funny little bunny sits
A-trimming furry jackets;
The fox-gloves bring along the mitts
Tied up in dainty packets.
The Gold-fish and the Guinea-pig
To the Penny-royal hint
The best place, if he wants a jig,
Is on the bank of Mint.

Now What D’yoii Think of That?
Seven little hens
Roam in our back garden.
They’re the best of friends,
And beg each other’s pardon
When anything goes wrong.
They say, “Excuse me, dear,
And then they cluck a song,
Or cackle sweet and clear;
And when they come to tea
They wipe most carefully
Their feet upon the mat.
NOW WHAT D’YOU THINK OF
THAT?
Five little chicks,
Tiny balls of down;
They have got more tricks
Than you’d buy in town.
They are always tripping,
Jumping up, and falling,
Staggering and slipping,
Stumbling on and sprawling.
They never leave their mummy,
And they’re growing very fat;
Just feel that little tummy!
NOW WHAT D’YOU THINK
THAT?
The rooster’s very proud.
He stands upon his toes
And strains his neck, and loud
He crows, and crows, and CROWS.
He gets up very early,
Because he’s got no bed;
He has to balance squarely
Upon a perch instead.
And when he meets a chook
He raises his wee hat
As grand as any duke
NOW WHAT D’YOU THINK OF
THAT?


Dear little Aussie bear, so tame!
“KOALA” is his lovely name.
He looks so very, very wise,
As with his shiny button eyes
He stares, and stares, and never blinks.
I often wonder what he thinks,
As he sits there for hours at ease,
And feeds upon the leafy trees.
How quaint to see the mummy bear
Climbing the branches with such care
While, sticking closer than a burr,
Her little baby clings to her!
He cuddles to her back all day,
And very rarely does he stray.
His mummy must be very strong
To carry him the whole day long.
