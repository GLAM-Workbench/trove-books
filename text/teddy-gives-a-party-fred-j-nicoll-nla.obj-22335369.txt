Won?t Benny Bunny, Hoppy Hare,
and all the others get a Big
Surprise when they get A Letter! They?ll wonder who it?s from, and What
It?s All About, and they won?t be able to get here Quickly Enough when
they find it?s a Real Invitation to a Party,? said Troublesome Teddy as
he scampered along the bush track with a bundle of letters. When he had
dropped them safely in the Bush Post Office, he walked back home singing:
My Party will be a Grand affair,
We?ll all have a Wonderful Treat,
But I?ll have to take the Greatest of Care
To see that there?s Plenty To Eat!
?I think I?ll make out a list of
all the things we will need,? he said,
so as soon as he arrived home he got
some paper and pencil, and began to
write.
?I?d better start with Benny,? he
thought, ?he is Most Important.?
When he had finished his list, it had
all THIS on it:
BENNY BUNNY likes Carrots and Apples.
HOPPY THE HARE likes Nice Green Grass.
EMMA EMU: ditto, ditto, ditto.
TONY TORTOISE likes Grubs (fat ones).
KANGA the Roo: I think he likes
Green Grass, too. (will ask him)
SQUEAKER SQUIRREL loves Nuts.

PETER PELICAN is crazy about Fish.
CROAKER FROG eats Insects (and Tadpoles).
POLLY PLATYPUS adores Worms.
SNICKER SNAKE: (must Find Out)
JOHNNY KOOKABURRA catches Lizards.
TEDDY likes JAM (All Kinds).
?Gracious,? he said, ?I nearly
left myself out, and I?ve put my-
self right at the Bottom. That?s no
good!? He crossed his name out
and put it at the Very Top .
?That?s better,? he said. Then
he scratched his ear. ?Goodness
me!? he cried, ?I forgot all about
my friend Pretty Pat. She?s MOST Important! And I know what she likes.?
So he wrote this down on his list:
?I?ll finish my list in a couple of shakes
Pat likes Sweets, and Jellies, and Cakes.?
?And now I?d better be off to the creek to get those Worms and Insects
and Things, and I know where there?s a wattle-tree full of fat Grubs that
Tony the Tortoise likes so much.? So putting a lot of tins and bottles in
his little cart, he set out for the creek.
Just about this time Kanga the Roo, who was Postmaster at Blue-
gum Post Office, had collected the letters and was talking to his assistant,
Johnny Kookaburra. ?There are quite a lot of letters, Johnny,? he said,
?and look most of them are marked ?Air Mail?, so you?ll have to be off
with them.?


?Confound it, Kanga,? said Johnny
crossly, ?I was just going to have a
Little Doze.?
?You can have a Big Doze after,?
replied Kanga, as he sorted out the
letters. All of a sudden he gave a
shout.
?Why,? he cried, ?here?s a letter for
ME! Look, Johnny, it says: ?Kanga
the Roo?, Bluegum Post Office! I won-
der who has been writing to me??
Kanga turned the letter over and
over. ?It?s got a Real Stamp on it, too.
Who do you think could have sent it,
Johnny??
?I know how you could tell who
sent it, Kanga,? Johnny said.
?How?? asked Kanga, excitedly.
?Open it,? said Johnny.
?Why, I would never have thought
of THAT,? replied Kanga, as he tore
open the envelope. Then he gave a
shout. ?It?s from Teddy,? he cried, jumping up and down, ?and he?s going
to have a PARTY, and he has sent me something with a Very Big word on
it. What does T-N-V-I-T-A-T-I-O-N? spell, please, Johnny??
?It means that Teddy wants you to go, Kanga!? Then Johnny looked
sad. ?I hope you will enjoy yourself, Kanga,? he said sadly, ?I wish I
could go.?
?Never mind, Johnny,? replied Kanga, ?I?ll bring you home a Nice Big
Lizard.?
?Thank you Very Much, Kanga,? said Johnny, ?please Don?t Forget.?
They began sorting out the letters when Johnny gave a Very Great
Shriek.
?WOW!? he cried, snapping his beak with excitement, ?Here?s a letter
for ME, and it?s got a Real Stamp on it, too. I wonder who could have
sent it??
?How about opening it and looking?? said Kanga.
?Why, of course,? said Johnny, ?that?s the Best Way to Find Out!? He
opened the envelope with his sharp claws. ?Kanga,? he cried, ?it?s from
Teddy! And he?s invited ME to his Party, too.?
?That?s fine, Johnny,? said Kanga, ?I wonder Who Else will be there??
Then Johnny looked at the letters. ?Why,? he cried, ?there?s a letter for
Benny Bunny, and Hoppy the Hare, and Emma Emu and All The Others!
Isn?t Teddy a Grand Little Chap to have a Party and ask us all to it!?
?My word he is,? said Kanga, ?now off you go, Johnny, and take all
those letters. Find Benny and Hoppy first, and tell them All About It.?
Johnny picked up the letters and with a few flaps of his strong wings
Page 4


f|was soon out of sight. He could fly very
[jfast, and could see a long way, and in a few
minutes he saw the two friends. Benny
Bunny was standing on a stump and Hoppy
|was trying his best to pull Benny off.
Johnny circled round and landed on a
branch just above Benny. ?Here?s a letter
for you, Benny,? he said, ?and one for
Hoppy, too.?
Both Benny and Hoppy gave excited
squeaks.
?Who?s it from?? asked Benny.
?What?s it All About?? cried Hoppy.
?Open them and see,? replied Johnny.
Benny and Hoppy quickly did so.
?Hooray,? they cried, ?it?s from Teddy and
he?s Giving A Party! Hooray!?
?And now I must be off,? said Johnny,
% ?I?ve got a lot more letters here. There?s
one for Emma Emu and Tony Tortoise, too.?
?Good old Tony,? cried Benny, ?hurry
up, Johnny, and tell all the others!?
Benny was so excited that he fell off
" the stump, but he soon picked himself up.
?Come on, Hoppy,? he cried, ?let?s
hurry over and see Teddy and tell him we
got our letters. And we can ask him
whether we can have games, and what we
will have To Eat!?
Scampering as hard as they could, it did
not take them very long to get to Teddy?s
place, but he was not to be seen anyivherel
?That?s funny,? said Benny, ?I wonder where
he is??
?There?s a Notice stuck up,? replied Hoppy,
?let?s see what it says.?
They hopped up to Teddy?s front door, and
sure enough, he had stuck up a board that had
written on it: ?Back at Five O?Clock.?
?Oh,? said Benny, ?we can?t wait that long for Bf 1 '
the little scamp. Shall we look for him, Hoppy??
?Yes,? said Hoppy, then suddenly pointing to
the ground he said: ?Look, Benny, he?s gone off
somewhere with his cart. There are the tracks


Hoppy quickly fixed himself up, and A A
laughing and giggling, they set off to the M w
creek. Presently they saw Teddy bending VwJlj l
over, catching worms. ?There he is!? whis- j/J
pered Benny, ?creep up behind those bushes, M
then suddenly Jump Up At Him!? Ija
Teddy, busy at his worm-catching, was \Sa
humming a Little Song. All of a sudden
of the wheels. Let?s follow them and see just what Teddy is Up To.?
?Perhaps he?s gone over to Pretty Pat?s place for a cart-load of Jam,?
said Benny hopefully, ?and perhaps he?ll want a Little Rest and open a Pot.?
The wheel-marks followed a track that led down to a little creek.
Teddy?s friends were hurrying along, and just as they were passing a pad-
dock where some pumpkins were growing, Benny started to giggle.
?What?s the joke, Benny?? asked Hoppy. ?What are you laughing at??
?Let?s cut some of these pumpkins, and give Teddy a fright,? replied
Benny.
?How?? asked Hoppy.
?I?ll show you,? Benny said, scampering under the fence. He took out a
little knife which he always carried in his pocket in case he found some
carrots, then quickly cutting a pumpkin he scraped out all the inside. Then
he cut holes for the eyes and nose, and a big wide cut, all jagged, for the
mouth. Putting the pumpkin over his head, he picked up an old sack, and
draped it round his body.
?Gracious, Benny,? cried Hoppy, ?it?s enough to frighten anybody !?
?You cut a pumpkin too, Hoppy,? said Benny, ?and there?s another sack
for you . We?ll frighten six months out of Teddy!?
Hoppy quickly fixed himself up, and
laughing and giggling, they set off to the
creek. Presently they saw Teddy bending
over, catching worms. ?There he is!? whis-
pered Benny, ?creep up behind those bushes,
then suddenly Jump Up At Him!?
Teddy, busy at his worm-catching, was
humming a Little Song. All of a sudden
Page 6


Benny and Hoppy jumped up, pumpkins and all, and loudly shouted
?BOO!?
Poor Teddy looked up, gave one terrified shriek, and scampered off up
the track. Benny and Hoppy held their sides laughing. ?That was great,?
cried Benny, ?Teddy won?t stop running until he gets home!?
?We can run faster than Teddy,? said Hoppy, ?let?s cut through the
bush and be there when he arrives. We ought to see Some Fun!?
Hastily pulling off the sacks, Benny and his friend quickly set off.
?I?ll take along my Pumpkin,? said Hoppy.
Before long, they arrived at Teddy?s place, but he was nowhere to be
seen.
?He?s not back yet, Hoppy,? said Benny, ?but he won?t be long, I?ll bet!?
Presently they heard a Scuffling and Puffing and poor Teddy, very Hot
and Very Tired, came scampering up the track.
?Hey, Benny and Hoppy!? he cried, his eyes nearly popping out of his
head, ?Run For Your Life ? the Hobgoblins Are Coming!?
Then he dashed into his little house and slammed and bolted the door.
Benny and Hoppy laughed and laughed. ?Gracious! wasn?t he scared!?
they said.
Teddy, safe inside, heard these strange noises, and cautiously opening
his little window, peered out.
?He-he-he,? giggled Benny. ?Ho-ho-ho!? laughed Hoppy.
Teddy was amazed. ?What?s all this He-he-he-ing and Ho-ho-ho-ing,?
he cried, ?aren?t you afraid of the Hobgoblins??
?Who, me?? asked Hoppy, laughing.
?Both Of You,? said Teddy.
?I?m not afraid of Benny,? said Hoppy, ?and Benny?s not scared of me.?
?What do you mean, Hoppy?? asked Teddy, crossly.
?Well, we are the Hobgoblins, Teddy,? laughed Benny, as Hoppy put
the Pumpkin over his head, and yelled, ?BOO!?


Teddy gave one look and shut the window
with a bang. ?My word!? he said to himself,
?I?ll get even with those scamps!?
He thought for a minute, then he grinned.
?I?ve got it!? he said gleefully.
He opened the door, and sitting down on
his front steps tried to Look As Sad As Ever
He Could.
?Cheer up, Teddy,? said Benny, ?you?re not
scared now , are you??
?It?s not that , Benny,? replied Teddy tear-
fully, ?you made me leave my cart down by
the creek and Tony Tortoise?s worms and
Croaker Frog s tadpoles will be Jumping and Wriggling All Over The
Place and Get Lost and there won?t Be Any at the Party.?
Hoppy and Benny Looked Serious. ?Never mind, Teddy,? Benny said
kindly, ?we?ll go and bring home the cart. Come along, Hoppy.?
As soon as they were out of sight, Teddy jumped up. ?I?ll teach them
to scare ME, he said, there are some clothes and things that a swagman
left behind in the old Hut. I?ll show Benny and Hoppy a Thing or Two.?
Scampering up the hill he soon came to the little Hut, and sure enough,
anging up on the wall were some old clothes and a hat. Teddy put on the
hat, which didn?t fit very well, and
although the coat and trousers were
far too big, he managed to keep them
on. Next, he found a piece of rope,
and teasing out the strands, made
them look something like whiskers.
With a piece of string, he fastened
these around his chin.
?Now, I only want a gun,? he said.
Making his way down to the track,
he found a branch of a tree that
looked something like a gun. Then he
sat down and waited. Presently,
laughing and chattering, Benny and
Hoppy came along, pulling the little
truck. When they came to where
Teddy was hiding, he suddenly
jumped out.
?HANDS UP!? he yelled, ?I?m Bad
Bill the Bushranger. Hands Up and
Turn Out Your Pockets.?
Page 8


? Ho ? Ho > Ho,? laughed Hoppy. ?He, He, He,? giggled Benny, ?how
can we??
?Stop that Ho-ho-ho-ing and He-he-he-ing At Once,? glared Teddy,
this is Nothing To Laugh At. And why can?t you What??
?How can we turn out our pockets if our Hands Are Held Up?? giggled
Benny. .
?Physical Impossibility,? said Hoppy, ?which means, It Just Can?t Be
Done.
?Well,? said the Bushranger, ?turn out All Your Pockets first.?
Benny turned out his pockets, and held out the following articles: One
knife (broken), One piece of string, two Aspirins and a bent Fish-hook.
Tl l e m. Hoppy turned out His Pockets, and showed: A piece of Tin, half a
carrot, Three Aspirins but no Fish-hooks. ?There you are, Teddy,? he said.
What did you say?? growled the Bushranger.
?I said: ?There You Are,?? replied Hoppy.
But what did you call me?? asked the Bushranger.
?Teddy,? giggled Benny.
Ted , d y stopped trying to Look Fierce. ?How did you know it was
luh! he asked.
Well,? said Hoppy, ?pure Deduction which means Logic which
means we knew because your clothes are Too Big, your stick isn?t a Gun,
your voice was too Squeaky, and you?ve got False Whiskers.?
?ALSO,? added Benny, ?your Ears Stick Out.?


Teddy took off the whiskers and the hat, and sat down on a log.
?It?s not Fair,? he said. ?You frightened me, but you wouldn?t let me
frighten r/ow,? he said crossly. ?I?ve a good mind not to ask you to my
Party.?
Benny and Hoppy looked sad. ?You can?t go back on your word, Teddy,?
said Benny, ?You sent us a letter with a real Stamp and Everything.?
Teddy scratched his ear. ?Gracious!? he said, ?So I did! I suppose
you?ll have to come, but don?t get up to Any More Tricks. Now, you?d better
run off Home, I?ve got a lot of work to do, cooking Cakes and Things.?
?May we come and help you, please, Teddy?? asked Benny.
?How?? replied Teddy, suspiciously.
Benny wiggled his whiskers, and Hoppy looked Very Hopeful. ?Well,
Teddy,? said Benny, ?we could Taste Everything to see if you?ve Made It
Properly.?
?You?ll do nothing of the kind, Benny,? said Teddy severely. ?Now off
you go.?
Poor Benny was disappointed. ?All right, Teddy,? he said, ?but we will
come to the Party Very Early .
Teddy waved to his friends, caught hold of the Cart and started off.
When he got home, he found his little friend Pretty Pat waiting for
him. ?Hullo, Pat!? he cried, running up, ?Did you get my letter and why
are you here and what?s in All Those Parcels??
Pat laughed. ?What a lot of questions you ask, Teddy!? she said. ?I
did get your letter, and I came over to help you, and those parcels are
mostly Jam!?
Teddy clapped his hands with delight. ?Now we can start Making
Things,? he said, as he opened his cupboard, and began to get ready.
Pretty Pat and Teddy worked hard,
and soon All Sorts of Nice Things
were baked and put aside. Nothing at
all happened to Teddy, except that he
burned his fingers, pulled the flour
over himself, knocked over the sugar-
tin, broke some eggs, dropped the
rolling-pin on his toes, and sat down
on a tart which he had put on a chair
to cool.
As he scraped the jam from his
trousers he said, Ever So Sadly:
?I?ve got fluffy flour all over my
Nose,
Indeed, I?ve made a Bad Start,
I?ve dropped the rolling pin right on
my toes,
And sat PLONK on a Hot Jam Tart.?
Page 10

Pat had brought along some coloured paper,
and she and Teddy set to work making a lot of
Party Caps.
At last everything was finished, and Pat was
ready to go home.
?Now, don?t go and get into Any Mischief, Teddy,?
she said, ?and don?t eat too many cakes or you won?t
be able to come to Your Own Party. I will be over
early on Saturday and help you to get things ready.?
?Goodbye, Pat,? said Teddy, ?and thank you
Very Much.?
The day of the Party came, and Teddy was
delighted to find the sun shining brightly. All the
morning he busied himself getting things ready,
and by the time Pat had arrived, nearly all the work
was done.
?My word, Teddy,? said Pat, ?You have been
busy! I will begin to set the table while you get
ready to welcome your friends. And wipe that jam
off your nose!?
Teddy went inside, wiped the jam off, and
brushed his fur. He had just finished when Benny
Bunny came bounding out of the bush. He had been
hurrying so fast he could hardly speak. ?Gracious, Teddy,? he gulped, ?I
thought I would be the last one here and Everything Would Be Over."
?Well, Benny,? replied Teddy, ?You?re the First one here, and we haven?t
even started!?
?That?s good,? said Benny, brightening up. ?Why here comes Hoppy!?
Hoppy Hare came bounding up. ?Hullo, Teddy,? he said, ?I just met
Snicker Snake, and he gave me a message for You.?
?Oh!? said Teddy, ?only a Message well, what was it, Hoppy??
?He said, ?Present my Compliments to Teddy, but request him to pardon
my inability to participate in his hilarious function!?
Teddy scratched his ear. ?What do all those Long Words mean, Hoppy??
?Well,? explained Hoppy, ?Snicker said, ?lf Teddy scratches his ear and
asks what all those Long Words mean, tell him: Thanks a lot but I Won?t
Be There!?? ?Oh!? said Teddy, ?did he say Whyl?
?Yes, Teddy,? replied Hoppy, ?he said: ?ONE: I
might Get My Tail Trodden On, and TWO: I don?t
want my Head Snapped Off by Johnny Kooka-
burra!? ?
?Poor old Snicker,? said Teddy sadly, ?perhaps
you could take him a party cap on your way home,
Hoppy.?
Just then, Emma Emu and Kanga the Roo came
hurrying up. ?Hullo Everybody!? they said, ?are
we Too Late??
Before Teddy could answer, along came Squeaker


Squirrel, Polly Platypus and Croaker Frog, then, with a rush of wings,
came Johnny Kookaburra and Peter Pelican. ?Hope We?re Not Too Late,
Teddy!? all said at once.
?We?re All here except Tony Tortoise,? said Teddy. ?I hope he hasn?t
Gone and Got Lost.?
Then they heard a snuffling and blowing, and Tony Tortoise, all hot
and tired, came waddling out of the bush. ?I hope Vm NOT TOO LATE,?
he said.
?Hullo, Tony,? cried Teddy happily, ?You?re Just In Time!?
?I should have had at least a Week?s Notice,? said Tony crossly. ?I set
out for here Three Days Ago, Non-Stop?
Pat had finished setting the table, and all wanted to sit Down At Once
And Start, but Pat called them all together and said:
?We will play games first, and then, when you are Really Hungry, You
Can Start.?
Some of them grumbled at first, but once the Games got going, they had
great fun playing games all you little girls and boys play at Parties. When
they were getting a bit tired, Pat called them together again and said:
?Now everybody has to do something: Sing a song, or do anything you
like, and I have a nice Prize for the one who does best.?
Everybody wanted to be first, and the squabbling kept up until Pat said:
?You?d better let me call out your Names. Now, Tony, you go first.?
Tony Tortoise pulled his head inside his shell, and Kept Very Quiet.
?Don?t be shy, Tony,? laughed Teddy.
Out popped Tony?s head. ?I?m not Shy,? he said, ?I was just having a
Little Think. I?m going to recite a Nice Poem.?
?Good Old Tony,? cried Teddy, clapping his hands.
?Order, please!? said Tony severely, then he cleared his throat and said:
?A Stupid Old Hare and a Tortoise So Wise
Once Ran a Race for a Very Nice Prize;
The Wise Tortoise won in fact, Eas-i-ly,
And the name of the Tortoise was ?Tony??that?s ME.?
Page 12

I I'
?Good Old Tony,? cried Teddy, and everybody
laughed and clapped, that is, all Except Hoppy the
Hare. ?I?ll race Tony Any Day,? he growled. ?Look,
Tony, can you do this ??
He threw his walking-stick up in the air, then
caught it on his nose, balancing it.
?Splendid, Hoppy!? said Pat. ?Now, who will
be next??
Benny Bunny had a try with floppy?s stick, but
couldn?t manage it, so he stood on his head and
wiggled his toes (and his whiskers).
Teddy threw apples to Peter Pelican, who caught
them all in his big bill and didn?t drop one .
Croaker Frog jumped four feet backwards, Polly
Platypus put up her head and Quacked like a Duck,
Squeaker Squirrel juggled three nuts, Johnny
Kookaburra looped the loop and flew upside down,
Emma Emu swallowed a jam-tin, while Kanga the
Roo astonished everybody by leaping right over the
table. ?Now, Teddy, it?s Your Turn. Let us see what
you can do,? said Pat.
?Right you are, Pat. I?ll show them a Thing or Two,? he said.
He hurried into his little house, quickly changed his clothes, and came
out carrying a wonderful little table on which were all sorts of boxes and
tubes and coloured handkerchiefs and things. Teddy?s friends Squeaked
and Clucked and Grunted and Quacked with excitement. Teddy put the
table down and said:
?Now, watch closely. The more you watch the less you?ll see the
quickness of the hand deceives the eye.?
?What does that mean, Teddy??
asked Benny.
?This,? replied Teddy. He pushed
a White handkerchief into a tube and
when he pulled it out the other end it
had changed to a Different Colour.
Benny?s eyes nearly popped out
with surprise when Teddy pushed an-
other White one through the tube and
it came out Orange.
?You?re Really Wonderful!? cried
Hoppy. ?How do you do it, Teddy??
?It?s Quite Easy,? said Teddy, ?but
you?ve Got To Know How!?


?Now, watch this one,? said Teddy,
picking up a hat. ?Come on, Benny,
you may help me. Now, look in the
hat ?there is Nothing in it, is there??
Benny had a look. ?Excuse me,
Teddy, but there Certainly Is.?
?What is in it, then?? asked Teddy
crossly.
?A Hole to Put Your Head in,? said
Benny.
?Well, Benny,? replied Teddy, ?ex-
cept for the Hole, there?s Nothing in
it, is there??
Benny had another look. ?Indeed
there IS, Teddy,? he said.
?What?s in it?? snapped Teddy.
?The Lining,? said Benny.
Teddy was getting impatient. ?Benny,? he said, ?except for the Hole
and the Lining, are you Sure there?s Nothing in it??
Benny had another Really Good Look. ?Yes there is, Teddy,? he said.
?WHAT?S in it NOW?? roared Teddy.
?A couple of Grass-seeds,? replied Benny.
?Now, Benny,? said Teddy, ?look in the hat. Is there anything Alive
that is Wriggling and has Fur and a Little White Tail??
Benny had an Extra Specially Good Look. ?No, Teddy,? he said at last.
?All right, Benny,? said Teddy, holding up the hat, ?say ?ABRA-CAD-
ABRA.? ?
Benny looked sad. ?I can?t, Teddy,? he said.
?Why?? asked Teddy, Very Crossly.
?It?s a Big Word, and I?d only go /MY
and get All Muddled Up,? replied f Jfm)s
Benny. l/iS&
?Well, Benny, say ?Gulla Gulla?.? f
?GULLA GULLA,? cried Benny f
quickly. 4
Teddy grinned, and putting his r /
hand inside the hat, pulled out the i
dearest little White Rabbit you ever
saw!
Benny squeaked in surprise. ?Why,?
he said, ?it?s my little cousin, Jumping
Jimmy. However did he get in your
hat, Teddy??
?I?ll explain after,? said Teddy,
laughing. ?Find a seat for him, Benny,
and if he behaves himself he can stay
to the Party.?
Page 14


?And now,? said Pat, ?you can all sit up to the table and begin.?
There was a wild scramble for seats. Hoppy got tangled up with his
walking stick, Benny tumbled off his stool, Kanga the Roo tripped over
his tail, and Croaker Frog, in his excitement, jumped too high and landed
PLOP into a dish of custard! Poor Tony was last, but with many grunts
and the help of Pat, managed to climb on to his seat. His eyes nearly
popped out when, right in front of him, he found a large tin of his
favourite grubs!
?Now, have a good time,? said Pat, ?but don?t eat too much . You?ve all
got to get home, you know. And Teddy, you must not make your whole
meal of Jam; you don?t want a pain in your tummy, do you? and stop
wiping your sticky fingers on the seat of your pants.?
Teddy and his pals had never had such a wonderful time in all their
lives, and there were so many nice things to eat that nobody knew just
Where to Begin and what to Start on First!
?Have some of these Buns, Benny,? said Teddy, ?they?ve got Sugar on
them.?
Benny didn?t reply, and Teddy said, ?I spoke to you, Benny, and I think
you are Very Rude not to answer. Don?t you like Buns??
Benny gave a big gulp and wiped his whiskers. ?I couldn?t answer you,
Teddy,? he said, ?I had my mouth full of cream cake.?
?Oh,? replied Teddy, ?that Explains it ?but don?t be So Greedy, Benny.?
It was a great day for Teddy and all his friends under the big gum-
tree, and it was not until most of the cakes and tarts had been eaten up
that anybody had much to say. They had all been Too Busy!
At last Pat said, ?Now, I think you should thank Teddy for giving you
such a good time. Perhaps, Benny, you could say a few words.?
Poor Benny blushed. He was no good at making speeches, and after
standing on his stool and falling off, he climbed up again and said:
?Friends, although Teddy is always getting into Mischief and being
chased by Hobgoblins, and wiping his sticky fingers on his pants and
putting my little cousin
Jumping Jimmy in his hat,
he is a good cake-maker,
and his Tarts are Extra
Special and his pies are
marvellous . So all stand
up, and give three cheers
for dear old Teddy.?
Everybody jumped up,
and called out ?HOORAY,
Teddy,? all except Benny,
who had his mouth full
again.


Hoppy the Hare tried to say something, but he was Too Full for Words,
so Kanga the Roo asked him what he intended to say, and when he tried
to say it, he found he was Too Full for Words, too .
So Pat had to say it all. She told them to keep on playing together, to
be the best of friends and not squabble. ?And now, friends,? she said, ?it?s
time Everybody started for home, especially Tony the Tortoise, as he is
very slow. You can all take your party caps home with you, and perhaps
Teddy will give you something else, if there is any left! Now, stand up,
Teddy, and say ?Good-bye? to your friends.?
Teddy wiped some jam from his nose, and climbed up on his stool.
Pat held his hand so he wouldn?t topple over. He waved his other hand to
his friends, and when they were all listening, quietly, he said:
?Pm glad my pals were here today,
But sorry you cannot stop,
But all take home a Slice of Cake
And a Bottle of Ginger Pop.?
