LIFE’S RECIPE.
This is for Life’s Recipe—
Take a cup of Courtesy,
Beat in Kindness, then Dry Wit
Of Gallant Mirth a little bit;
Stiffen well with Strength’s smooth flour
Into Square Deal mould then pour.
In Love’s mild warmth this mixture bake
And then with Tolerance partake.
P.S. The merest pinch of Irony
Will season well Life’s Recipe!


ME—BY NICO.
As my small soul, lost in dreams, did stand
By the Suck-a-thumb Sea in Babyland,
There came an Angel, tall and bright,
And said, “Little man, you’ll be born to-night,
Come now to the Ten Toes’ Shop with me.”
(It stands beside the Pat-a-hand Tree).
So, tucked ’neath my Guardian Angel’s wing,
I crossed the small River of Chuckling,
And, passing the Garden of Skip and Hop,
Arrived at the Ten Toes’ Baby Shop.
My Angel said, “Now choose for yourself,”
So I snalfled a pointy chin—like an elf.
Then I saw, and snatched, a small snub nose,
For mouth I picked a tiny rose.
I clutched, as they swung sparkling by,
Two deep blue stars, one for each eye.
And then—so that I’d not look thin—
I took a NICE FAT double chin.
My Angel saw, and said with a smile,
“You can only use that for a little while;
You’re only allowed to keep one chin.”
Said I, “Would you have your baby look thin?”
I made my mark in the Book of Fate,
Then—off to the world thro the Byser Gate.
Just before we gently on Earth did land,
My Angel kissed into arm and hand
Some dimples round, to play with me,
And sing me songs of the Suck-a-thumb Sea.
He laid me soft in a cosy bed
And, tickling my cheek, he smiled and said,
“Little man—although it makes you look thin
You MUST return that double chin.”


Months happily pass with Mum and Dad,
I’m always good and never bad.
They guess, I think, when they hear me sing,
That I feel the touch of my Angel’s wing,
Or that, when I laugh and clutch the air,
I see my guardian hovering near.
He says, “What about that double chin?”
And I gurgle, “You can’t want your baby thin.”
When my toothache pains, and I start to cry,
I generally find him standing by.
And my wail is changed to an impish grin
As he laughs, “How about that double chin?”
Then he stoops and kisses my dimples round,
Till I drop into slumber, deep and sound.
One night, he said, “It would be a sin
To make my baby gay look thin ”
(in an excited whisper) So I think I’ll keep my double chin
When Daddy and Mummy turn out the light,
He often comes to me, strong and bright.
And I smile in my sleep as I dream I stand
By the Suck-a-thumb Sea in Babyland.


CHILD’S GARDEN SONG FOR NICOLAS.
An Angel walked in a garden. He smiled at the
freezia pale,
And marked how the peony flaunted and the pansy
frowned at a snail.
His wings in majesty folded, He stooped to the lily’s
scent,
And—pacing slowly onward—to the violet’s shyness
bent.
A sunbeam, small and timid, into a shadow crept.
The jasmine, greatly daring, His robe with fragrance
swept.
He helped a busy spider some fairy lace to spin.
He laughed at the pansy’s tantrum, and tickled the
snail ’neath its chin.
The sunbeam, taking courage, from the Shadow’s
haven strayed,
To the Angel’s wing-tip floated and perched there
undismayed.
The rose-bud coyly opened and blushed to a deeper
red,
As it swayed to greet His passing and gently touch
His head.
The Angel His wings unfolded; as their snowy star
flecked span
Encompassed the peaceful garden, the sunbeam,
skipping, ran
To dance round the nodding blossoms, whilst the
Angel of Flowers swept
With a small breeze (as escort) to Heaven —and the
snail and the spider slept.






RHYME FOR A RASCAL.
(To the portrait of a little boy.—K.B.S.)
Saucy scamp—so full of glee—
Smiling from your frame at me,
Tell me what the joke may be.
Though your round head’s brushed so sleek
Mischief’s elves play hide and seek
With baby roses on your cheek.
Sturdy scamp—so full of glee—
Roguish dimples wink at me,
Tell me what the joke may be.
Snub nose quaint up-wrinkling,
Blue eyes gaily twinkling
With star-dust brushed from Angel’s wing.
Little scamp—so full of glee—
May God grant this boon to me,
Smooth and fair, your life’s path be.


THE PRAYER OF THE DOG.
Preserve me from the snapping tooth,
The lashing whip that knows no ruth.
Keep poison’s menace well at bay,
Let kinder Night close my Life’s Day.
When eyes have lost their sparkle bright,
And happy hearts their courage light,
When eager paw runs slower—slower
And cunning nose has lost its power,
Grant then a sympathetic hand,
A friendly Boss to understand;
Thick mats laid on unpolished floors
And sluggish cats (quite minus claws).
Let Peace her gentle wing outspread
Above a warm and cosy bed,
And when Death’s whistle clear shall sound
Great Master soothe this little hound.


THE RABBIT’S RONDEL.
Thro’ the long wet grass I trip,
Trippity trip—trippity trip;
Whilst cool the little raindrops drip,
Drippity drip—drippity drip;
My long soft ears I gaily flip,
Flippity flip—flippity flip.
Ah! Here’s my burrow —in I skip!
Skippity skip—skippity skip!
THE SONG OF THE SHINGLED BEE.
No other bees with me will mingle
’Cause I’ve gone and had a Shingle!
They think I am a lost, lost soul,
And with my family they condole.
I’m tired of the dowdy frumps
That throng the hives—so off I jumps
And to a nearby barber elf
I hastily betakes myself.
Now, deep I am in black disgrace,
I hardly dare to show my face.
The village lads make comments funny
When I go out to gather honey.
No decent folks with me will mingle
’Cause I’ve gone and had a Shingle!


Soundly sleep! Up on a wall,
Stretched out neatly, one by one;
Out of reach of cats that maul,
Let’s lie, cosy, in the sun.
Dream! Dream fatly of large flies
Snapped up brightly “on the run!”
Safe from danger and surprise,
Let’s snooze, cosy, in the sun.
Baby lizards, small and sleek,
Worn out by their play and fun;
Lizards fierce, lizards meek!
Let’s drowse, cosy, in the sun.
Soundly sleep! Up on a wall,
Stretched out neatly, one by one
Out of reach of cats that maul,
Let’s lie, cosy, in the sun.
THE SAUNTERING OF A SNAIL.
Slowly stroll I on my way,
Awake at night-asleep by day.
To gardener’s grief, I plod up-leaf,
Gathering rose-buds whilst I may.
V\ hen some danger halts my way
Tucked within my shell I stay.
In comfort curled, I flaunt the world
Then, when it’s safe, I onward stray.


Heaven keep from out my way
Boys with heavy boots at play,
Foes that ramp, with lime and lamp,
All agog with fell death ray.
Languid stroll I on my way,
A-move by night—asleep by day.
Tho’ slow my walk, yet each bare stalk
Shows plain I pause not nor delay.
Cease I nibbling to pray,
“Lord of Snails, keep from my way
Paris green or poisoned bean.
I trust in thee—do not betray.”
Placid stroll I on my way,
Awake at night—asleep by day.
Tho’ misplaced zeal my life would steal,
I’ll gather rose-buds whilst I may.


THE JEREMIAD OF A JEWFISH.
Jewfish, who owns pawnbroke shop,
Wily oysters tries to cop.
“Shell out please”—but off they hop!
Sob, sobbo, sobbo, sobbo.
Octopus, with plaintive face,
Tries all-comers to embrace.
Better keep clear—just in case.
Sob, sobbo, sobbo, sobbo.
Leviathan, with whisking tail,
Snaps up Jonah in a gale;
Says Jonah, “Life’s just one long wail!”
Sob, sobbo, sobbo, sobbo.
Jewfish, owning pawnbroke shop,
Wily oysters tries to cop.
“Shell out please”—but he comes a flop.
Sob, sobbo, sobbo, sobbo.


THE YODELLING OYSTERS.
(Slightly inebriated.)
Round the beach we rowdy roysterers
Shout and dance a ballet boisterous!
We are the yodelling, yo-o-odelling oysters!
Yoi-oyst, yoi-oyst, yoi-oi/sters!!!
Comes a CHILD, she wants to hoist us
Out of shell, and down throat foist us!
Not in these pearlies! Phuff! Porpoisterous!
Yoi-oyst, yoi-oyst, yoi-opsters!!!
Pippee! Pippee! Rowdy roysterers!
We bream o’er with fish yarns boisterous!
Whale not! Laugh! Yo-yodelling oysters!
Yoi-oyst! Yoi-oyst! Yoi-oysters!!!


THE PASSING OF THE BOATS.
My rigging is of rainbow hue,
Purple, orange, scarlet, blue.
My mast of beaten silver gleams,
My cargo is of childhood’s dreams.
My rigging is of sombre hue,
My mast a ragged stalk of rue.
A mist of salt tears round me gleams,
My cargo is of broken dreams.
THE FAIRY PRINCESS.
Around her silken draperies swirl,
Coral, amethyst and pearl.
The while her golden hair unbound
Like a mantle wraps her round.




TO A BUTTERFLY.
Butterfly, butterfly, make me some butter
When out of reach of my clutches you flutter.
Butterfly, butterfly, make me some butter.
TO COUSIN JEAN’S CAT.
Kitty Cat, Kitty Cat, purring for me,
“Boiling your kettle” to make me some tea


THE SUNBEAM AND THE CLOUDLET
A sunbeam said to a cloudlet,
‘Must why must you appear,
To dim my little candle,
And shed a doleful tear?”
The cloudlet answered the sunbeam,
“Why, don’t you know, my dear,
That a candle shines brightest in darkness
And a rainbow lives in a tear?”
We need both sunbeam and cloudlet,
Where would hope be without fear?
Where would light be without darkness?
Where the rainbow live with no tear?
ROOFUL (Not Rueful) RHYME.
Mysterious, vocal and aloof,
Dear pussy sings upon the roof,
Whilst neighbours curse in strong reproof,
Regardless, vocal and aloof,
Dear pussy sings upon the roof.
In full voice, scornful and aloof,
Dear pussy sings upon the roof,
Whilst dog, below, does helpless pine,
His throat astir with useless whine,
Dear pussy sings upon the roof.
Quite callous, yowling and aloof,
Dear pussy, sing upon the roof.
Let humans swear with words uncouth,
Let dog’s eyes glow with yearning. Poof!
Dear pussy, sing upon the roof.


Mysterious, vocal and aloof,
Dear pussy, sing upon the roof.
Though others find you more than tryin’,
I love you—for you’re mine, all mine,
Dear pussy, singing on the roof.
THE BABY’S “BYSER” SONG
Cosy sleep—thy Mother’s arm
Holds thee close, in cradle warm;
Guards thee safe from any harm,
Sleep, my little baby, sleep.
Cuddled snug thy small form lies,
Violets fringed, that are thine eyes,
Softly close in sleepy byse,
Sleep, my little baby, sleep.
Eager feet that busy ran,
Mischief bent, since day began,
Now are quiet, saucy man.
Sleep, my little baby, sleep.


Gently rocked on Mother’s breast,
Tiny, drowsy cherub, rest;
Love’s sweet prayers thy dreams have blest.
Sleep, my little baby, sleep.
Guardian Angel o’er thee bends,
Snowy wings thy soul defends;
On thee slumber soft descends.
Sleep, my little baby, sleep.
Cosy sleep—thy Mother’s arm
Holds thee close in cradle warm,
Guards thee safe from any harm.
Sleep, my little baby, sleep.
LULLABY FOR NICO.
Sleep in safety, little son,
Day is over—dark is come.
Little moonbeams haste the sun,
Sleep in safety, little son.
Sleep in safety, little son,
Shadows lengthen, work is done.
Starlets peep forth one by one,
Sleep in safety, little son.


THE NOUNS’ TEA-PARTY.
Here are Beauty, Health and Grace,
Next them Hate—with scowling face
Dignity, majestic—cool,
Watches Nonsense play the fool.
Joy peeps in, her eyes a-shine,
Whilst Despair alone doth pine.
Then Endurance, Power, Speed!
Slinking after, furtive Greed.
Mercy, with her gaze benign,
Jealousy, with eyes malign.
Misery, weeping, cedes the way
As Mirth strides by with laughter gay
All Virtue and all Vice abounds
At this tea-party of Nouns.
NICOLAS—LITTLE CONQUEROR
Be loyal to Empire, honor the King,
Live a life that’s strong and true,
Be clean and straight in everything,
Meet bravely all that comes to you
Be tireless till the race is run,
And rest is granted, little son.


Mopoke! Mopoke!
Summer dusk is falling.
Little moonbeams chase the clouds,
Hark! the Bush is calling.
Curlews wail—their eerie plaint
Like to lost souls mourning,
Till their last wild cry is drowned
In the day’s bright dawning.
Dingoes prowl—their hungry dirge
Rising high—then falling.
Shivering calves their mothers seek,
Hark! for Death is calling.
Heat haze shrouds the ranges dark,
Fireflies’ candles glimmer.
Far-off thunder’s drum beats low,
Distant lightnings shimmer.
Mopoke! Mopoke!
Australian dusk swift-falling.
Exiled spirit, pause—and hear!
Hark! the Bush is calling.
TO A CECIL BRUNNER ROSE.
Tiny buds so pinkly curled,
Then so daintily unfurled.
Set in clustered thickness sweet,
Nodding gay each bee to greet.
Flower babies, cool and pure,
Curtseying to the breeze, demure;
Small friends warmed with blushes sweet
As you nod each bee to greet.


32 THE PILLOW PAT POEMS
TO A PUSSY WILLOW TREE.
Pussy Willow, tell me now,
Why you neither scratch nor me-ow?
Why you don’t like meat or milk?
Pussy Willow, soft as silk.


Pussy Willow, show me now,
Your kittens that climb up each bough.
Baby cats of fluffy grey
Scuttling up your twigs in play.
Pussy Willow, tell me true,
Don’t your kitties purr or mew?
Don’t they like to lap up milk?
Pussy Willow, soft as silk.
FAIRY WAR-SLOOPS.
Little fairy ships of war,
Tell me true—have you come far?
Are your sailors good or bad,
Fierce or gentle, gay or sad?
Little fairy ships of war
Sailing on to strange lands far.
NICOLAS NOCTURNE.
My boat by love’s soft breeze is fanned
When I drift off to Bysie-Land.
Small sails I set of fun and glee,
Then venture forth on Sleep’s calm Sea.
And oh! What lovely things I’ve planned
Ere I arrive in Bysie-Land.
I’ll chase the moonbeams till they fall
Exhausted in a cloudlet small.
From stars’ bright lanterns gay I’ll swing
Play “I see” through a cherub’s wing.
Search bus’ly for my friend the sun,
Find where he goes when day is done.
(Also —if I get the chance —
Discover what makes shadows dance.)


Gaze awed as through Heaven’s violet deep,
I see a Great Archangel sweep.
I’ll tease the raindrops till they cry
(They’ll soak me if I don’t look spry.)
Give wide berth to the lightning bright,
I touched it— once. Oh! what a fright!
The thunder, too—bad-tempered fellow,
He chases me with fearsome bellow.
I’ll climb a rainbow to the sky
To ask the winds what makes them sigh.
(Fearfully in hushed whisper)
Then to God’s footstool p’raps I’ll crawl,
He wouldn’t scold a baby small?
And—if I manage to get near—
My happy croon maybe He’ll hear.
When I drift back from Bysie-Land
My sails by Angels’ wings are fanned.
O’er dawn’s bright sea of rosy gleams
My ship glides—full of baby dreams.


THE MULLY GRUBS’ LAMENT.
Mully grubs chant soft and low,
Clad each in his kimino.
Tropic sun each grub has burnt,
Till he wishes that he weren’t.
Triantywobbegong shouts loud,
To the oar each back is bowed.
Mully grub-chant sad and slow,
Clad each in his kimino.


The violet swoons beneath its leaf,
Whilst willows weep in hopeless grief;
Each pansy scowls—its painted face
Expressive of extreme distaste.
The lily rings her silver chime
To mark the hours of Sundial Time.
Frail diamond-studded cobwebs dance,
The shy sweet primrose to entrance.
The asters’ glowing jewels burn,
The sunflowers to their bright god turn.
The poppy shakes her lacy skirts,
And with the little breezes flirts.


Gay honey-suckle trumpets shout
To drive the blundering beetles out.
Snow-stars of jasmine gently swing
Faint with their scented blossoming.
The glow-worm’s lantern lights the way
To where the spicy clove-pinks sway,
In drowning fragrance buried deep
The heavy-headed roses sleep.
TO NICOLAS FROM MUMMY AND DADDY
Tiny son—so peaceful sleeping,
Mercy have you in its keeping.
Guard your little soul from harm,
Cradle you in haven calm.
Tiny son—so peaceful sleeping,
Mercy have you in its keeping.


Little lad—so soundly sleeping,
Kindness have you in its keeping,
Smooth the path before your feet,
Fill your life with flowers sweet.
Little lad—so soundly sleeping,
Kindness have you in its keeping.
Smallest fellow—fearless sleeping,
Courage have you in its keeping.
Undimmed by clouds of doubt or fear,
Your little life’s bright star shine clear
Smallest fellow—fearless sleeping,
Courage have you in its keeping.
Heart of our’s—so cosy sleeping,
Dear love holds you safe in keeping.
Enfolds you warm by night and day,
Each baby trouble soothes away.
Heart of our’s—so cosy sleeping,
Dear Jove holds you safe in keeping.


YULGILBAR.
Jewel set in lonely land,
Girt by river’s silver band;
Quiet strength no storms can mar—
Mountain-guarded Yulgilbar.
Dream of pioneer—in stone,
Drowsing in the Bush alone;
From town’s fret and bustle far—
Lovely, tranquil Yulgilbar.
Though deserted, not forlorn—
Fearlessly you greet each dawn;
Peaceful wait the eve’s first star —
Shadow-haunted Yulgilbar.


SOLO PIECE.
(By diaries Nicolas Bawden Sahine.)
I have one surname, so I’m told,
Of Christian names I’ve three;
But “funny little fat-faced fellow,”
That’s what Dad calls me.
Whilst list’ning sometimes you would say,
“I wonder which he be?”
For “Snarlywinks” and “Savage Tiger,”
That’s what Mum calls me.
They call my turned-up nose “The Snub”
(In fun, you understand),
My sit-down place “The Mae West curves,”
And “patter-scratch” my hand.
I have one surname, so I’m told,
Of Christian names I’ve three;
But those I know and love the best
Are Dad’s and Mum’s for me.


V^v^^.-Zj^v,'
A FLOWER FANTASY.
DRAMATIS PERSONS: A Violet, a Snowdrop, an
Oak, a Sprite—and a threatened but practically
invisible Snail.
SCENE: A large garden with pleasant outlook.
TIME: Any time.
In a cool secluded corner a Snoivdrop and a
Violet are quarrelling violently as to their im-
portance in the scheme of things. Above them,
in quiet gracious majesty, towers an age-old
Oak.
THE VIOLET ( snappily ): Anyway, I never did care
for the pale washed-out type.
THE SNOWDROP ( becoming slightly green with
anger and ringing its bell in a towering pas-
sion) : And I never admire purple—a hideous
show-off color.
THE VIOLET ( stamping a leaf with rage and turn-
ing almost white): “Show off,” is it? Well, at
least I don’t stand about hanging my head all
the time, ashamed to look up. . . .


A PASSING SPRITE (suppressing a chuckle) ; Here,
here, you two —quiet, please. The Evening
Breeze complains that he can’t even hear him-
self sigh because of the din that goes on in
your corner. Quarrel, quarrel—fight, fight.
Who d’you think you both are, anyway?


(The Oak leaves ripple in a shadoiuy smile): One
more word out of either of you and I’ll sool a
Snail on to you. Here, Lightning ( calling to a
yard-off Snail), if these two are still bickering
by the time you reach them —say, the week
after next —nibble them both —you hear me?
An oozy giggle is heard from under the Snail’s
shell and two horns appear for a minute, point at the
Violet and the Snowdrop and then vanish. The Violet
cowers and the Snowdrop’s bell tinkles in faint
apology.
An amused rustle shakes an Acorn from the Oak.
It falls with a plop near the Violet and the Snowdrop,
frightening them nearly to fading point. An inquisi-
tive Thistledown sails quietly near. The Sprite skips
on to it.
THE SPRITE ( sternly—but in a suspiciously shaky
voice): Remember!
CURTAIN
A PENNY PLAY.
DRAMATIS PERSONAL: Two Pennies.
SCENE: Act I, Scene I, The Mint. Act I, Scene 11, A
Slum Street. Act I, Scene 111, A Chemist's
Shop. Act I, Scene IV, The Mint.


TIME: Any time.
The scene opens at the Royal Mint. Two
Pennies, brand new, are lying side by side
waiting fo-r distribution.
FIRST PENNY: Well, brother—soon now we start on
our travels.
SECOND PENNY: Yes, indeed {sighing), and we
meet again—when?
FIRST PENNY: Who knows? Let us give each other
a slight scratch so that we will always recog-
nise each other again should our paths cross.
They mark each other with a short line across
the King’s face, each exclaiming in a coppery aside
whilst so doing, “The King—God Bless Him.”
CURTAIN
ACT I, SCENE II: One Penny finds its way into the
pocket of a member of a two-up school. His
particular master, being a crook, makes him
into a double-headed Penny. Eventually this is
discovered by a fellow-member of the gang,
and his master is shot. In the uproar that en-
sues he is collected by the police and “called
in” again to the Mint.
CURTAIN
ACT I, SCENE III: The second Penny has a more
peaceful life. He strolls placidly from pocket
to pocket and from purse to purse, observing
life as a philosopher and hearing much wisdom


of a quiet sort. Finally, he ends in a penny-
in-the-slot weighing machine in a chemist’s
shop. As it is just at the beginning of George
Vi’s reign, he fs recalled to the Mint.
CURTAIN
ACT I, SCENE IV: THE MINT: The two Pennies
meet again. The recognition is mutual and joy-
ful. Time and events have not effaced the
scratch they exchanged on the day of their
exodus from the Mint. After welcoming each
other the First Penny speaks.
FIRST PENNY: Well, brother, our travels are over
—for the time being.
SECOND PENNY: Yes, indeed (sighing), and now?
FIRST PENNY: Who knows? Let us say farewell to
each other. The King is dead —Long live the
King!
SECOND PENNY (in a coppery undertone) : The
King—God Bless Him!

SONG OF THE SUNBEAMS.
Ha! Ha! Gaily do we dance!
Off the wattle’s gold-dust glance;
Chase that saucy Morning Star
(See! It’s twinkles fly afar!)
Teaze the little sparkling streams


Till their laughter silver gleams.
Into Bush Bell gently steal
Slyly ring its scented peal.
Ha! Ha! Gaily, gaily dance!
Make the sea’s white horses prance!
See them shake their manes of spray
Rearing proudly—Quick! Away!
Play a game of hidey-seek
With dimples fat in baby’s cheek.
Kiss small limbs to gentle glow,
(Careful! Do not mar their snow.)
Tickle snails so stout and brown.
Ride upon the thistledown.
Till each shadow eastward slants
Ha! Ha! Gay oh gay we dance!
WHITE HORSE OF STORM.
The White Horse of Storm, he neighs down the sky,
Wild winds shriek in horror as he gallops by.
The lightning’s his eyes, that flicker and flash,
The thunder’s his hoof-beats, that boom and that
crash.
Hark! the Storm Horse he neighs down the plains of
the sky,
Black clouds weep in terror as he gallops by.

THE LAY OF THE MOONBEAM
Down rainbow’s ribbon swift I float
(Beware th’ fierce snap-dragon’s throat!)
The Gum Nut is my sturdy boat
That braves the dang’rous Dewdrop Moat.
Whilst soft the Night-born Zephyr blows
I glide into each drowsy rose,
Gently swing them as they doze
Rock them into deep repose.
Perched careless on their petals’ brink
I from the blue-bells’ chalice drink,
Lightly kiss the frilly pink
Then skip to hide me—Where d’you think?
Can you keep a secret well?
Let me whisper—don’t you tell!
In lily of the valley bell.
Hear it ringing? Ding dong dell.

TO REDCAP DOLL AND PILLOW-PAT.
When off to byser bye I go
Two friends I always take.
They’re with me all the long night through,
They welcome me awake.
My smiling Redcap doll so fat,
And Pillow-pat, dear Pillow-pat.
They guide me to the Small Cloud beach
Beside the Moonbeam sea,
They coax each little twinkly star,
To come and play with me.
My Redcap doll—so stout, so fat,
And cosy cuddly Pillow-pat.
They tell me what the evening breeze,
Is whispering to the rose,
And why the firefly dances so,
And why the glow-worm glows
My Redcap doll, benign and fat,
And Pillow, Pillow, Pillow-pat.
Dear playmates I do love you dearly,
As much as Dad and Mum? Well—nearly.
My Redcap doll, so round, so fat,
And Pillow-pat, my Pillow-pat.


SEA SONGS OF A SMALL ONE.
TO THE SEA.
I run to meet my friend the sea.
And he romps, sparkling, to meet me,
Green banks with crests of foaming snow
Eager to meet you, off I go.
Fat legs fast twinkle to the sea
As he romps eager to meet me.
I’m saucy to my friend the sea,
(With Daddy’s hand to steady me)
I jump those banks with crests of snow,
And fearless deeper—deeper—go.
I’m very skittish with the sea.
(With Daddy’s hand to steady me).
I dearly love my friend the sea,
And I think, d’you know?—that he loves me.
He lifts and swings me off my toes,
Then rolling, splashing, on he goes.
I roll too, sometimes! Oh, dear sea,
I love you so. Do you love me?
I run beside my friend the sea,
As he romps gaily to catch me,
His little wavelets chase my toes,
With foaming speed each ripple flows.
Small dancing sunbeams gem the sea,
As he romps gaily to catch me.


Oh, romping, splashing, laughing sea,
So mighty yet so kind to me.
Whilst Mummy lazes on the sand,
My Dad and I go hand in hand,
To plunge and play in you, Oh sea!
So strong and yet so kind to me.
I dearly love my friend the sea,
And I think, d’you know? —that he loves me.
At night when into bed I creep
His lullabye croons me to sleep.
Dear playmate, friendly rolling sea,
I love you so. Do you love me?
TO DADDY.
Daddy digs the sand with me,
Runs me races to the sea,
When the waves forget I’m small
And roll me over like a ball.
Daddy picks me up again,
Oh, we’re great friends—we two men.
When bustling legs, so fat and short
Tire with running, up I’m caught
Into Daddy’s arms. My plea
(Full of pathos) “Carry me”
Is never made in vain—but then
We’re the best mates we two men.
Mummy’s nice—but what a fuss!
(’Course she’s not a man like us.)
When I’m busiest with Dad
Comes orange drink, or other fad
Or else its “bysie” time again,
What we bear with—we two men.

Dressed in trunks along the sand
Dad and I walk, hand in hand.
Sometimes he may throw a stone
And I pursue it (not alone)
I chuckle, squeal and laugh again,
Oh. Dad and I—just we two men.


When night time comes (I s’pose it must)
And eyes grow dark with sleepy dust.
’Gainst Dad’s broad shoulder off I’m borne
To play by Dreamland’s Sea till dawn.
When I wake up its day again,
We’re up and doing—we two men.
Daddy calls me “Mate” and “Friend”
Will always to my chat attend,
Which Mummy sometimes will not do,
She says “Hush, Hush” before I’m through.
Dad’s veiy interested —but then,
We’re the best mates—we two men.
By this little song you’ll see
My Daddy’s all the world to me,
Sorrows fade when he appears,
Smiles and laughter chase all fears.
He’s large, I’m only two —but then
We’re the great mates —we two men.
TO A LITTLE FRIEND.
On sand, in rock pool, we have played,
You’ve lent your bucket and your spade,
Beneath our tent-fly, in the sea,
You’ve dug and talked and splashed with me.
You’ve come and watched me whilst I’m fed
Tiptoed and peeped at me in bed.
To see you coming Mum and Dad
Have always, as you know, been glad
To entertain a baby small
You’ve given up your time and all.
I’ll miss you sadly I confess,
Good-bye and thanks—C.N.B.S.


TO A SHELL ON THE BEACH.
Mummy sits by me and tells
Of fishies’ houses (some call “shells”).
How they swim the great blue sea
To come at last to Nic’las (me)
Little houses. Snug inside


Their painted walls do fishies hide.
On dark and stormy nights they’re tossed
Around and round—but never lost.
On quiet days they sail along
Sung fast asleep by mermaids’ song.
Sea Urchins sometimes capture one
To make it angry—just for fun.
Small faiiy boats that sail the sea
To come at last to Nic’las (me).
I love to sit whilst Mummy tells
Of fishies’ houses (some call “shells”).
TO A ROCK POOL.
I know a very special place
I peep in it and see my face.
Shadowed, rippled, quiet, cool,
It waits for me—my own rock pool.
When Daddy was a tiny one


He learnt to swim in it. What fun!
Mum says that when the fairies pass
They use it as a looking glass.
Whilst Daddy calls “Quick, come here, son.
Look! There’s a little fish!” What fun!
One day, when sitting by myself
Beside my pool, there came an elf,
A little chap with roguish face
And small cloak spun of sea-foam lace.
He caught a passing sunbeam bold,
And dropped it in the water cold.
It danced and sparkled there with fright
The elf and I squealed with delight.
A near by limpet came undone
And peered from ’neath its hat. What fun!
A big cliff frowned and said, “Now, boys,
What’s all this, please? Less noise, less noise
The elf then seized some seaweed stout
And drew the angry sunbeam out.
It skipped away with scoldings loud,
And hid itself behind a cloud.
The limpet got done up again,
A passing breeze sighed gently—then
The elf was gone. But my rock pool
Lay rippling with its chuckles cool,
Small laughter swayed its shadows deep.
P’raps it thought I’d been asleep!


Upon the back of Daddy’s head,
A round white spot there sits.
A tiny star, it never fades
