REFACE.
The following pages were written last year during the leisure
hours of professional and parliamentary work. They are designed
to place before the public a brief sketch of the History of Land
Legislation in Victoria—showing the provisions and operations of
our various Land Acts; the effect of these Acts in promoting or
discouraging the settlement of people upon the soil; the causes of
partial success and partial failure of our Land Policy; and the
direction in which a sound principle of Land Reform must be looked
for. At the present time, when a new Land Bill is before the
country, proposing somewhat radical alterations in the existing
law, it becomes convenient and appropriate to take a retrospect
of past legislation. In the forthcoming political contest many
young voters will be called upon to take part, for the first time, in
the great and important work of moulding the destinies of their
country. In that struggle there will be no question submitted for
their consideration more important than the future disposal of the
remaining acres of Victorian soil. These pages will enable them
to take a bird’s-eye view of previous Land Acts, and to become ac-
quainted with the opinions of some of Victoria’s greatest poli-
ticians in reference to the land question; in other words, they will
here find materials out of which they can form opinions of their
own, and vote accordingly. From the sentence which follows the
reader will see what the present writer’s views are. The whole-
sale alienation of the public lands, and their stealthy but rapid
absorption into large estates, is a crime and a calamity, which can
only be averted by the steady, intelligent and irresistible opposi-
tion of the people of Victoria to a policy at once demoralising and
destructive.

CHAPTER I.
EARLY HISTORY OF THE VICTORIAN LAND SYSTEM.
The history of the tenure of land in the Colony of Victoria has
passed through four distinct and successive stages; each of which
is rendered remarkable by peculiar features, the result of the
period of national growth to which it belongs. The first stage of
this process of the development of our land laws and customs was
that which preceded government control in Australia; when land
was selected and taken possession of by the first comer on the old
principle of Roman Law, quod nullius est occupanti conceditur,
which, according to some political philosophers, marks the origin
of what is now known as absolute private property in land. The
second period was that in which the rudely and crudely organised
administration representing the British Government in Australia
interfered with and prevented the unlicensed occupation of waste
lands, and proceeded to impose upon the occupants payment of a
nominal rent, reserved upon a yearly license. The third epoch
marked the transition from executive to legislative regulation, and
the inauguration of an administrative scheme constructed by the
Imperial Parliament, and promulgated in the Act 5 and 6 Vic-
toria, chapter 36, for the guidance of the local Government. Fi-
nally the Imperial Parliament gave to the Australian Colonies local
self-government, and the control of waste lands of the Crown (a).
This country was originally, like the United States of America,
settled by squatters, who, roaming along the coast and into the
interior, took up and inhabited unoccupied lands wherever they
could find them (b). These enterprising settlers were called
“ squatters,” from a very imperfect analogy derived from the
American term “ squatters.” The American squatters were really
what we called selectors in Australia—that is, free-selection-be-
fore-survey men. The early squatters of Australia were a bolder
and more ambitious class. They took up vast territories of un-
occupied land as large as German principalities, which they pos-

June, 1848. Hansard, old series, vol. 1, p. 155,


sessed for many years with very considerable advantage to them-
selves. Sir George Gipps, one of the early Governors of New
South Wales, thus described the mode in which these settlers took
up the land “ The ‘ run,’ or portion of the country severally
appropriated by them, was limited only by their own moderation
or the pressure of other squatters upon them. Mr. Edward
Hunter writes ;—“ "\V hen a new district is opened by some entei
prising colonists, there is a general rush for runs. The first comer
takes a bird’s eye view of an extensive and well watered valley,
and, without any reference to the extent required for his stock, he
says : ‘ This is my run.’ The next follows his example, and, in
a short time, the whole district is parcelled out” (a). In a pro-
clamation of the Governor, dated 21st May, 1839, the act of en-
croaching on any station previously occupied is said to be contrary
to the previous usage of the colony (b).
From these facts it appears that the practice of squatting was
of an earlier date than any executive regulation or legislative en-
actment. It was the spontaneous growth of private adventure,
and became recognised as a part of the pastoral system (c). In
1835 the expediency of this unauthorised occupation of waste
lands was first questioned. It then began to be feared that if the
squatters were allowed to remain in possession, they would heie-
after contend —as they really did (d) that this permissit e oc-
cupancy was a recognition of their rights to demand titles of ab-
solute proprietorship. Then the local executive imposed a nomi-
nal rent upon occupation, which was subsequently commuted into
a nominal fee, payable annually, for an occupation license. This
license fee was not intended to be a payment of rent for the use
of the land, but merely “ as a certificate of the character, and a
recognition of the precarious nature of the title of the occu-
pant ” (e). . .
Such was the origin and principal features of the early history
of the squatting system in New South Wales, Port Phillip being
then a province of that colony. In the words of the report of the
Crown Lands Commission of Victoria, 1854-5 : —“ Founded rather
in default of laws applicable to the subject, than in contravention
of any subsequently recognised by local statutes and regulations,
it constituted a general tenure of Crown Lands strictly provisional,
while the title conferred upon the individual occupants was entirely
at the sufferance and discretion of the representative of the Crown.
The provisions of these early regulations were enforced by certain
Crown Lands Commissioners, who exercised magisterial functions.

The occupation license system may he thus summarised The
right was given to depasture waste lands beyond the boundaries of
location, or under a license, obtainable on the approval of the
Crown Lands Commissioner of the district. The license was in
force for a year. It was issued without regard to the extent of
area occupied, upon payment of an uniform fee of £lO. Separate
licenses were required for separate stations. Renewal of the
license was granted to the licensee in possession, subject to the re-
commendation of the Commissioners. The licensee was liable to
dispossession at any time if the land was required for the purpose
of public sale ; nor was the licensee entitled to compensation for im-
provements. These regulations gave great power to the Commis-
sioners, and did not satisfy the squatters. But they remained the
principal features of the system until the proclamation of the
Imperial Statute of 28th August, 1846 (9 and 10 Victoria, c. 104),
with the Order of the Queen in Council founded thereon, dated
9th March, 1847.
The squatters regarded the Land Commissioners as intolerable
despots, and agitated for fixity of' tenure and pre-emption, as a
security for permanent improvements. Headed by Mr. Benjamin
Boyd (who held 1300 square miles of country), they applied for
concession of the rights and privileges they claimed from the Home
Government. “ They managed their business nicely in Downing-
street,” said an orator, who once took an active part in land reform
legislation in Victoria, “and in 1847, on the shortest possible notice,
came these famous Orders in Council, and then the squatter as-
sumed a vastly different bearing. The humility was gone, and he
strutted in a surprising manner. The colonists were astonished at
the new state of things. They found that the squatters had got
more than they asked for, and, having got it, they kept it ” (a).
It will be necessary, in order to throw light on the merits of the
subsequent struggles, to present the main provisions of the Statute
and the Order of the Queen in Council,
The first section of the Act gave Her Majesty in Council power
to demise for any term of years, not exceeding fourteen, to any
person, any waste lands of the Crown in the colonies of New
South Wales , South Australia , and Western Australia , or to grant
to any person a license for the occupation for any term of years,
not exceeding fourteen, of any such waste lands, and to reserve
upon such demise or license any such rent or service, and to insert
therein certain conditions and clauses of forfeiture. Section 7
authorised Her Majesty to make rules and regulations for the pur-
poses of the Act, to have the force and effect of law in the colonies.

on tins Act, provided—“ It shall he lawful for the Governor of the
colony to grant leases of runs of land within the unsettled districts
to such person or persons as he shall think fit, for any term or
terms of years, not exceeding fourteen years in duration, tor pasto-
ral purposes, with permission, nevertheless, for the lessee to cul i-
vate so much of the lands respectively comprised in the said runs
as may be necessary to provide such grain, hay, vegetables, or
fruit for the use and supply of the family and establishment ot
such lessee, but not for the purpose of sale or barter; and so,
nevertheless, that such leases shall in no case prejudice, interrupt,
or interfere with the right of the Governor or other officer for the
time being administering the government of the said colony o
enter upon any of the lands comprised in the said leases for any
purpose of public defence, safety, improvement, convenience,
utility, or enjoyment, agreeably to the provisions for those purposes
contained in the ninth section of the second chapter of this Order
in Council, or otherwise.” The only other important sections ma-
terial to quote are sections 9 and 10 of chapter 2.
g ECT . 9 _« That nothing in these regulations or in any lease to
be granted shall prevent the Governor/rom making grants or sales
of any lands within the limits of the run or comprised in
such lease, for public purposes, or disposing of in such other
manner as for the public interest may seem best, such lands as may
be required for the sites of churches, schools or parsonages, or tor
the construction of the high roads or railways and railway stations,
or other internal communications, whether by land or water, or
for the use or benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants of the country,
or for public buildings, or as places for the interment of the dead,
or places for the recreation and amusement of the inhabitants ot
any town or village, or as the sites of public quays, or landing
places on the sea coast or shores of navigable streams, or for the
purpose of sinking shafts'and digging for coals, iron, copper, lead,
or other minerals, and effectually working coal, or iron or copper,
lead or other minerals, or for any other purpose of public defence,
safety, utility, convenience or enjoyment or for otherwise facilitating
the improvement and settlement of the colony ; but so that the
quantity of land which may be granted or sold to any railway
company shall not exceed in all the rate of one hundred acres for
every mile thereof in length.”
Sect. 10.-—“ That if at any future period a railroad be made
through or near to the districts comprising unsettled lands,
all lands within the distance of two miles from that railroad shall,
notwithstanding any lease of the run within which such lands shall
be situated, be liable to be sold at the end of each successive year
from the date of the said lease : Provided that at least sixty days
previous notice shall have been given to the lessee, and so that


such lessee shall be entitled to all the same conditions, reserving to
the previous lessee the right of pre-emption and the value of im-
provements as are hereinafter mentioned, with reference to the
case of a sale at the expiration of the full term of such lease. 5 ’
The rent to be paid for each run was to be proportioned to the
number of sheep, or an equivalent number of cattle, which it was
capable of carrying. Each run was to be deemed capable of carrying
at least 4000 sheep, or an equivalent number of cattle. In no case
was a run to be let at a lower rental than £lO per annum, to
which £2 10s. per annum was to be added for every additional
1000 sheep depastured on it. During the continuance of any lease
the land comprised in it was not open to purchase by any one ex-
cept the lessee, but the Government could sell to the lessees any
of the land comprised in the lease, an area not exceeding 160 acres,
at a price not below £1 per acre. Leases of new runs were to be
tendered for. The mode of acquiring leases of previously existing
runs was:—“All occupants of Crown lands who had been in licensed
occupation of the same for at least one year at the time when this
Order in Council shall come into effect, were entitled to demand
leases of their respective runs under the regulations, within six
months from the date of the publication of this Order, but not
afterwards ; and all occupants who had been in licensed occupation
of their lands for a shorter period than the term of one year, were
entitled, upon the expiration of the same term of one year, with-
out having forfeited their respective licenses, to demand leases of
their respective runs under the regulations herein contained : Pro-
vided such lease shall be lawfully demanded within six months after
the expiration of the said term of one year, but not afterwards.”
For the protection of improvements made by Crown tenants
provision made in the conditions under which any sale could take
place after the expiration of a lease. By section 15 of chapter 2
“Upon the expiration of a lease, it was competent for the
Governor to put up all or any part of the lands included in a run
for sale, subject to the following conditions:—
“ First-—The previous lessee shall have the option of purchasing
the land for its fair value in an unimproved state, which shall
never be estimated at less than £1 per acre.
“ Second—lf declined by the previous lessee, the value of any
improvement on the land.offered for sale shall be ascertained by
valuers appointed under the provisions contained in section three
of the second chapter of this Order in Council: Provided, never-
theless, that the sum so to be estimated and allowed for is in no case
to exceed the amount of the actual outlay made by the lessee.
“ Third—The upset price shall then consist of the joint value of
the land and the improvements, and, if the land be sold, the
amount of the improvements shall be paid over to the previous


lessee, and only the balance be retained by the Government.”
In the intermediate districts the Governor was authorised to
grant leases not exceeding eight years in duration. In the settled
districts the Governor could grant leases of land exclusively for
pastoral purposes, not exceeding one year in duration. He was
empowered to make rules under which owners of purchased lands
within the settled districts could be permitted to depasture on ad-
jacent Crown lands free of charge. This was the beginning of the
principle of free commonage, very strongly advocated by liberal
land reformers when it was proposed to leave it out of the Vic-
torian Land Bill.
Although the Orders in Council arrived in the colony in 1847,
they could not be enforced for several years afterwards. The
claimants under the 11th section promptly sent in their applications
for leases, but after the lapse of a considerable time they were
exasperated to find that there was no immediate prospect of their
getting their leases before the year 1851. The explanation of this
delay, which was a fortunate circumstance for Victoria, was very
simple. There were practical and physical difficulties opposed to
the issue of the leases. A proclamation, issued 7th October, 1847,
stated that it would be impossible to issue leases on demand. The
districts had to be grouped into settled, intermediate and unsettled
districts. Boundaries of districts and runs had to be surveyed,
and surveys were expensive and difficult. Before these matters
were settled, an event occurred in Victoria—in the meantime
separated from New South Wales—which changed the destinies of
the country, and gave an entirely new aspect to the land problem.
Gold was discovered, and an eager population began to pour to
these shores from all parts of the world. The squatting party
in Melbourne became alarmed, and moved the Nominee Council
to present an address to the Lieutenant-Governor (Mr. Latrobe)
on the subject, which was done on 20th August, 1852. In reply, His
Excellency stated that no leases could be issued for the present,
and, under the circumstances, he expressed his intention to refer
the whole question to the Home Government, and declined to
pledge the faith of the local Administration. This was undoubt
edly a most prudent policy, for which the Lieutenant-Governor
deserves every commendation. Unfortunately, however, his deter-
mination not to issue leases to the pastoral tenants was coupled with
another, which proved disastrous to the infant colony—that was to
suspend the sale of town lands. This caused landed property
already purchased to rise to an enormous value. Old holders sold
out at big prices. Then began the cry: “Unlock the lands.” The
sale of town lands was resumed, and next came a collapse.
Those who had bought alienated land at high premium were
ruined, and demanded the recall of the Lieutenant-Governor, It


was alleged that his policy was to favor the old land-owners of
Melbourne. His friends, on the other hand, asserted that he had
prevented the squatters from grasping the public land.
Meanwhile the squatters continued their agitation. On 2nd
September, 1852, a meeting of licensed occupants of Crown lands
was held at the Prince of Wales Hotel. The report of the pro-
ceedings, which appeared in the squatting organs of the day, de-
scribed it as a large and influential meeting. J. Cane Riddell, Esq.,
occupied the chair. It was proposed by Mr. John Goodman, J.P.,
seconded by Mr. Alexander Cunningham, J.P., and carried unani-
mously—“ That the pastoral tenants of the Crown having been
assured of the possession of leases for eight or fourteen years
respectively, in the settled, intermediate and unsettled districts,
by Her Majesty’s Orders in Council, dated Bth May, 1847, pro-
vided in an Act of the Imperial Parliament, have a just claim to
have those orders, which came into operation on 7th October, 1847,
carried out according to their spirit and real intention, as more
fully explained in Lord Grey’s despatches of 20th November, 1846,
and 20th March, 1847.” It was then proposed by Mr. W. Camp-
bell, M.L.0., and seconded by Mr. W. F. Splatt, M.L.0., and car-
ried —“That claims to leases, with the privilege of purchasing at a
valuation, became marketable through the sanction of the Govern-
ment, by the proclamation of Ist January, 1848, and that a very
large proportion of the present holders have purchased their claims at
a higher value, so that property to a large extent has changed hands,
under such pledges of public faith, and in the fullest confidence
that the law affecting so great an interest, would be held sacred
by the British Parliament.” The third resolution was proposed by
Mr. Wm. Forelonge, and seconded by Mr. A. Campbell, and carried
—“That the demand for land is fully provided for by many millions
of acres within the settled and intermediate districts, which, under
the Orders in Council, may be made available for agricultural pur-
poses.” Mr. Colin Campbell moved, and Mr. Horace Wills se-
conded—“ That the squatters of this colony, while they admit that
the agricultural wants of the community should be amply provided
for, are also of opinion that the maintenance of the pastoral inte-
rest is of still greater importance, as they supply a large extent of
wool required at home for manufacturing purposes, and at the same
time provide a sufficient supply of animal food, which cannot be
imported for the use of a rapidly increasing population, and that
a system of long leases for pastoral purposes is calculated greatly
to develope the resources of the colony, by justifying the expendi-
ture of capital on valuable improvements” (a).
These unique resolutions set forth in ample and undisguised
(a) Campbell's Crown Lands of Australia, No. 51, p. 135.


terms the squatting policy of 1852, which was to maintain "V ictoria
a vast sheep walk. One statement contained in the first resolution
referring to the squatters claim to 8 or 14 years’ lease for certain,
as supported hy Lord Grey’s despatches, must he referred to ,it
can be easily refuted.
On 29th November, 1846, Earl Grey sent a despatch to
the Governor of New South Wales, containing a draft of
certain Orders in Council, which it was proposed to pass under
the Imperial Act. This despatch contained the following
expression;— £< Land in the unsettled districts, according to
these regulations, would be put absolutely out of the power
of the Crown, and be rendered unavailable for settlement for
the long period of 14 years.” On the strength of this des-
patch it was contended that it was the intention of the Imperial
Government that the maximum terms of 14 years leases in un-
settled districts, and 8 years’ leases in intermediate districts, should
in every case be granted. It was, however, overlooked by the ad-
vocates of this doctrine that the words of the draft orders, for
term of 14 years duration” in unsettled districts, were not in-
corporated in the Orders in Council, as finally passed on the 9th
March, 1847, which state that leases might be granted for terms
not exceeding 14 years in unsettled districts, and not exceeding 8
years in intermediate districts. Besides Lord Grey’s own con-
struction of the order was clearly and unmistakably given in a des-
patch to the Governor (Sir Charles Fitzroy), dated 6th August,
1849, in which this passage occurs ; —“ But inasmuch as the order
of 9th March leaves the term of years to be granted entirely at
your discretion, you will be able and justly entitled to refuse to
such persons any lease for more than a year, unless they are willing
to accede to the insertion of such conditions as you may require.”
A report of a Select Committee of the Legislative Council of
N.S.W., dated September, 1847, stated:—“ That the period of the
lease both in the unsettled and intermediate lands appears to be
left entirely to the discretion of the Governor.” The Crown Law
Officers of New South Wales gave a similar opinion. The Crown
Lands Commission of Victoria, 1854-5, supported the same view.
We now come to the result of Governor Latrobe’s reference to
the Home Government of the legal definition of the squatters’
rights. In a despatch to the Lieutenant-Governor, the Duke of
Newcastle, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, stated ;
the reasons adduced why the portion of the Orders in Council, which
declares that actual leases shall be granted on demand, has hitherto
remained a dead letter, and most probably will remain so, un-
less some equitable adjustment intervenes. They are satisfied that
the circumstances of the colony have rendered the surveys, which


are considered essential perliminaries, to the execution of the leases
impracticable, and that such extensive surveys will long be im-
practicable. This is an obstacle which no one fully appreciated be-
fore hand, and for which no one is justly responsible. But the
occupants have, in addition, no grounds to complain of this delay,
because the burden, in fact, lay on them, and not on the local
Government, to furnish such descriptions of their runs as might
render it possible to grant a lease, and the assistance of survey
was a benefit offered them by the local Government, and no part
of their rights, and still more because, in the absence of leases,
they seem to have engaged up to this time the full practical
benefit of leases.”
In the course of the same despatch the Duke of Newcastle ex-
plained the position which, in the opinion of the Home Govern-
ment, the squatters occupied. It was intended to give them
adequate use of the land, and adequate protection against disturb-
ance in it; but not any advantages over any other member of the
community in becoming purchasers of it, except to the very limited
extent required for their actual accommodation ; still less was it
intended that they should become speculators in land purchasing,
on terms peculiar to themselves, in order to sell again in the general
market, and least of all was it intended that their pastoral oc-
cupation should stand in the way of the development of general
population and industry. “ If,” said the Duke, “ the occupants
insist in the extreme view of their right as controlling the obvious
meaning of the concessions made to them, it becomes incumbent on
the Government to protect the public, by insisting on the rigorous
interpretation of the Orders in Council when its provisions seem to
clash with the public interests. They are entitled to the ex-
clusive right to purchase when the Government thinks fit to sell
them land during the currency of their lease.”
Such was the position of affairs when, on 2nd November, 1854,
the Crown Lands Commission of Victoria was appointed by Sir
Charles Hotham, to inquire into the laws and usages then exist-
ing by virtue of which the waste lands of the Crown in the
colony of Victoria were occupied ; what alterations thereof were
necessary for the public advantage and convenience, and the
nature and extent of all claims which may have arisen under
such laws and usages. The members of the Commission were the
Hon. Wm. Foster Stawell, Attorney-General; the Hon. James
Fred. Palmer, Speaker of the Legislative Council; Captain Andrew
Clarke, Surveyor-General; Charles James Griffiths, Esq., President
of the Commissioners of Sewerage and Water Supply ; and Messrs.
J. O’Shanassy, J. F, Strachan, J. P. Fawkner, Wm. Nicholson,
Wm. Clarke Haines, Charles Bradshawe, Wm. Forelonge, members
of the Council. The report of the Commission, dated Bth June,


1855, concludes as follows -
“It will now, we believe, be admitted that the system constructed
by the Waste Lands Occupation Act and the Orders in Council
does not satisfy the conditions of this question, or effect a proper
balance of the various interests involved. A strict adherence to
the provisions of the existing law, while it might not prove bene-
ficial to the occupants themselves, would be most embarrassing to
the community at large. At the same time, those strict rights, of
whatever extent, as well as those claims to general consideration
which the pastoral class confessedly possesses, must be recognised
and respected. This object will, we submit, be best attained by
that commutation of the present tenure of the squatters which we
are about to recommend. Sound policy, in truth, dictates an en-
tire and radical re-adjustment , upon the basis oj compromise, of a
question surrounded by so much complexity of interest, and points,
first, to the extinction of all rights and pretensions opposed to the
paramount claims of permanent settlement; and, secondly, to the
expediency of conceding to the pastoral class—which adds to its in-
determinate rights, under the existing law, the claims arising from
actual possession and invested capital —such security as the na-
ture of the case may admit, and upon terms of payment which may
at once secure some equivalent for the benefit conferred, and may
discourage unproductive occupation.
“We therefore recommend:
“1. That the survey and sale of the Crown lands of the
Colony should proceed continuously, with reference to
the requirements of all classes of purchasers, and in
quantities sufficient to prevent the price from greatly
exceeding at any time the present upset price, as pre-
scribed by law.
“ 2. That yearly licenses , renewable from year to year, should
be given to the present occupants for pastoral purposes
only, which should hold good against any other licensee.
“3, That the rent to be paid should be regulated by the
grazing capability of each run, subject to a mode of de-
cision to be proposed, and should be at the rate of 6d.
for every sheep, 4s. for every head of cattle, and 1 Os.
for every horse which the run should be estimated as
capable of carrying.
“ 4. That the above general rate per head of stock should
be open to periodical re-adjustment at the expiration
of each period of five years from the date of occupa-
tion under the proposed system ; to be effected by com-
petent authority, and to be applicable in common to
all occupants.
“ 5, That a minimum limit, based on extent, should be im-


posed of Id. per acre.
“ G. That a legal tribunal, in the nature of a court of appeal
from valuation, should be constituted, to which either
the Government or the occupant should be at liberty
to appeal against the existing estimate of grazing capa
bility.
“ 7. That the proposed regulations should take effect indiffer-
ently upon all waste lands of the Crown throughout
the colony, the present territorial classification, and
the regulations dependent upon it, being abandoned.”
It was the Governor’s intention to have submitted to the Council
a bill containing provisions for the final adjustment of the question
during the current session, but, owing to the late period of the ses-
sion at which the report was received, he was precluded from doing
so. ,
It may be here convenient to draw attention to some of the griev-
ances of which the people of the colony complained against these
“princes of wool and lords of tallow,” who were so determined in their
agitation for further concessions. In 1853 there were 335 squatting
runs in Victoria ;in 1854 there were 351; in 1855 the number de-
creased to 260 ; in 1856 there were 278. Some of these squattages
were of an enormous extent. Two persons in the Wimmera held
allotments 789 miles in area. One person held 62,000 acres, and
returned himself as being in occupation of 35,000. In the Port-
land district a well-known pioneer had 57,000, carrying a sheep to
the acre. The following squattages were in full bloom in the year
1857: There were 20 squatters holding from 150,000 to 200,000
acres; 52 squatters holding from 150,000 to 100,000 acres ; 150
squatters holding between 50,000 and 100,000 acres ; 341 holding
between 20,000 and 50,000 acres ; and 227 holding between 10,000
and 20,000 acres. What was the consideration given to the coun-
try for these enormous estates! Under the original executive
regulations, as already seen, they had to pay a £lO license for each
holding. This tax would not pay anything like their fair share of
police protection and mail communication. Then the squatters
generously consented to pay an assessment of a half-penny per sheep,
in order to help to pay something like their share of the cost of
government. Every shilling of this assessment was, of course, ab-
sorbed in paying for their own convenience, nothing going towards
the general revenue. For example the proceeds of the assessment
of New South Wales for the year 1849 amounted to £43,854 13s. 4d;
the proceeds of the assessment of Port Phillip district amounted to
£10,413. The expenses charged in the Sydney assessment were
£11,940; whilst those charged in the Port Phillip assessment were
£8713 (a). It was subsequently stated by Mr. J. P. Fawkner in the
(a} Votes and proceedings Sydney Council, 1849.


Victorian Legislative Council that, if the proportionate share of the
squatters’ expenses of the mails and police were examined, it would
be found that they had the whole of the assessment, and licensed
money paid by them for that year swallowed up, and nothing
paid by them went towards the general cost of government (a).
In 1852 the squatters, who were the predominant party in the
Legislative Council of Victoria, repealed the half-penny assessment,
thus depriving the colony of its revenue of £20,000 per annum.
In the following session, however, on the urgent advice of Mr.
Fawkner, an assessment of 2d. per sheep was adopted. At about
the same time the same venerable pioneer advocated the necessity
of the extension of the settled district of Victoria, but the proposal
was lost by 9to 18 members (b). On 23rd November, 1855,
Victoria received the new constitution and representative govern-
ment. With that constitution the Imperial Parliament handed
over to the Parliament of Victoria the control management and
disposal of all the waste lands of the Crown within its boundaries.
The Imperial statute which ratified our constitution (previously
drawn in the colony) repealed the Land Sales Act 5 and 6 Victoria,
chapter 36, and the Amending Act 9 and 10 Victoria, chapter 104,
so far as they were repugnant with the Constitution Act. The
Orders in Council were not repealed, but the Act stipulated ex-
pressly that nothing therein contained would prevent, or be con-
strued to prevent, the fulfilment of any promise, or contract, or en-
gagement, made by, or on behalf of, Her Majesty, where such con-
tract, promise, or engagement had been lawfully made before
the Act. From this it will be seen that the Orders in Council, in
reference to the lands of the colony would remain in force _ until
the Victorian Parliament took steps to pass new laws, incon-
sistent with the old ones. In this manner the Parliament of Great
Britain abdicated its right of sovereignty over 57,245,760 acres
of the finest land in the world, worth, at the very least, £100,000,000
in upset value. Let us now see how those entrusted with the des-
tinies of the young country exercised the power thus conferred.

CHAPTER 11.
THE HAINES LAND BILL.
At the time of the introduction of Parliamentary Government
into Victoria, Mr. Wm. Charles Haines was the Premier and Chief
Secretary. His colleagues in the Ministry were :—Mr. (now Sir
Wm.) Foster Stawell, Attorney-General; Mr. (afterwards Mr.
Justice) Fellows, Solicitor-General; Captain (afterwards Sir And-
drew) Clarke, Surveyor-General; Mr. (now Sir Charles) Sladen,
Treasurer ; Mr. Childers, Commissioner of Customs (now a mem-
ber of the Gladstone Government); Captain Pasley, Commissioner
of Works. A few particulars of the antecedents of the father
of the first Victorian Land Bill may be of some interest : —Wm.
Clarke Haines’ father was a general practitioner in Hampstead,
and he himself was a duly qualified London surgeon. Arriving
in the colony at an early period of its history, he started an agri-
cultural farm at the Barrabool Hills, in partnership with Mr. John
Highett. In 1851 he was appointed by Mr. Latrobe, a nominee
member of the Legislative Council, and he occupied that seat
until October, 1852, when he resigned, in order to seek a seat as
representative member. Shortly after his resignation he was
elected by the farmers of South Grant, and was returned to the
Council with increased influence. He never displayed any bril-
liant qualities entitling him to distinction as a statesman—he was
merely a quiet plodding member. When Mr. Foster was driven
from office, on account of his alleged responsibility for the Ballarat
riots in December, 1854, Mr. Wm. Clarke Haines was, much to
the surprise of the House and the country, appointed Colonial Se-
cretary by Sir Charles Hotham ; thereupon the hon. gentleman
abandoned the plough and the Barrabool Hills, and adopted that
occupation so much despised in these degenerate days—a profes-
sional politician. Such, briefly told, was the career of the gentle-
man who, in November, 1856, occupied the important position of
Chief Secretary, and inaugurated the new Constitution,’ and won
the title of the “ father of the first Land Bill and of democracy
in Victoria,” From the record of his subsequent career, it turns


out that he was not entitled to the proud designation of the
“ father of democracy,” though he was responsible for an abortive
Land Bill, which met with the universal execration of the
country. Those who well knew his private sympathies and an-
tipathies, as well as those who have narrowly scanned the acts of
his public life, assert that he had an invincible aversion to demo-
cratic liberty, and yielded unwillingly to the adoption of proper
checks on the expenditure of public money. “Mr. Haines,” wrote
an able critical observer of the time, “is a sunshine politician —
an exotic which will die out. He wants intellectual force. He
looked upon ruling as a business, not a duty. He did not compre-
hend the spirit and tendency of the age ” (a).
The new Parliament was opened by General MacArthur on 21st
November, 1856. In the course of his opening speech, the Acting-
Governor alluded to the necessity of early attention to the subject
of land legislation. “Bills,” he said, “will be laid before you, the
main feature of which will be the continuance of sales by auction,
and of the present upset price ; provision for the more speedy issue
of deeds of grant by dispensing with double registration ; the con-
cession of facilities to owners of land for contracting with persons
desirous to mine for gold, saving inviolate the right of free-
holder to the undisturbed possession of the land; the rescinding of
the existing Orders in Council regulating occupation for pastoral
and other purposes ; the power of granting an interest to the pre-
sent occupant, renewable until the land is required for sale, or any
public purpose, but subject to an acreable rent, to be periodically
determined by an independent tribunal, according to the grazing
capabilities of the land, and the advantages of its situation,
and the adjustment of claims on account of actual loss sustained
by occupants.”
On the 17th December, 1856, Captain Andrew Clarke, Surveyor
General submitted to the Assembly, and moved the adoption of
resolutions framed by the Haines’ Government, as embodying the
main principles of their land policy. It was proposed that crown
lands should, for the purposes of sale, be divided and distinguished
into three classes: —(1.) Town lands. (2.) Suburban lands. (3.)
Country lands. The first class was to comprise lands within the
limits of any city, town, village or hamlet. The second class
comprised lands which . derived increased value from their
proximity to any town, village, or hamlet. The lands of the first
and second classes were to be sold by public auction only, their
upset prices being not less than £8 and <£l 10s. per acre respec-
tively. The lands of the third class were not to be sold except by
public auction, unless they should have been first submitted to sale
by public auction, and not sold then unless the upset price was fixed
(A) Parliamentary Portraits, Melbourne Leader,


at <£l per acre. The resolution then went on to provide for the demise
of crown lands to the then authorised occupants of runs for pastoral
purposes, at an acreahle rent, so as to produce an average of 2d.
per acre, available for such purposes ; the rent of each run being
assessed at the rate of £25 for every 1000 sheep, or their equi-
valent in other stock which the land was capable of depasturing,
subject to increase or decrease in consideration of special advan-
tages or disadvantages of situation. Power was also given to the
Governor to issue leases of lands (not comprised in the last reso-
lutions) for pastoral and other than mining and agricultural pur-
poses, but every such lease was to be submitted for competition at
public auction. Leases of land for pastoral purposes to other
than the existing occupants of such lands were to be sold at
public auction. Annual licenses, to occupy crown lands for other
than pastoral, agricultural, and mining purposes, could be issued
at a rate not exceeding £SO per year. Leases or licenses for
mining purposes other than silver or gold could be issued, pro-
vided they were submitted to competition at auction.
It will be observed that the resolution providing for the aliena-
tion of town, suburban, and country land in fee, contained no
feature which could distinguish the proposed bill from the old
system, which had been in operation in the province from 1842
up to that time. The system proposed to be perpetuated was sale
by auction at a fixed upset price, although there was a strong
party in the country already beginning to clamor loudly for free
selection before survey and deferred payment. Captain Clarke,
in moving the resolution, felt some difficulty in reconciling the
stand which he took on that occasion with his advocacy of de-
ferred payment and free selection three years and a half pre-
viously, when he took charge of the department. His explana-
tion of this remarkable discrepancy between his principles and
his practice was that “ although it might have facilitated the
occupation of the lands, he did not believe it would work well in
the end.” No doubt the system of sale by auction had its disad-
vantages. He was aware that under the speculation which had
gone on in the country the value of land had gone up to a large
price at auction. That might affect individuals but it would not
affect the interests of the community. Referring to the necessity
and scope for settlement, Captain Clarke pointed out that at that
very moment there were 55,000,000 acres of public land unsold,
which represented at least £100,000,000 of public money com-
puted at the upset price proposed. They would have to consider
the wants of the colony in regard to public works, and he asserted
that they had to look to the sale of waste lands as the means of
carrying out those works, without which the country could never
become great. Captain Clarke next explained the proposed pro-


vision relative to the squatting tenure, “Although,” said he, “ I
have been considered by many as thoroughly opposed to the
interests of the class referred to, yet I feel it necessary, for the
sake of the colony—indeed, more—l feel it my duty to propose
what shall meet the exigencies of the country. I shall not in any
shape or way attempt to ignore the rights of that class.” The
proposal of the Government was that the squatters in occupation
of crown lands under the Orders in Council should receive a lease
of their lands for a term of seven years, with a right to a renewal
of that term, or a re-adjustment of their rent in accordance with
the progress of values. In the case of sales of such leases it was
intended to secure for the outgoing pastoral tenant the value of
his improvements. In case of disputes between the crown and
tenants arrangements were to be made for their settlement by
arbitration.
At this time the squatters held licenses for the occupation of
42,000,000 acres, yet the returns sent in by the squatters them-
selves gave only 29,195,276 acres as the total extent of country
occupied by them, leaving 14,000,000 acres of available land from
which the State received no revenue. It was, for this reason, pro-
posed by the Government, that the taxation or rent of runs should
in future be based upon the land actually occupied, and not to the
stock upon it, 2d. per acre being the average price fixed. It was
expected by the Government that the Act would give .£350,000
per annum for the occupation of crown lands and .£537,000 from
the sale of land.
“ My object,” said the Surveyor-General, in conclusion, “is to
do away with the term squatter at once and for ever. My
anxiety is that there should be no storm, but that by a careful
consideration of the question the House may arrive at such
resolutions as will enable the squatters to know upon what terms
they hold these public lands—that the lands held by them must
be profitably occupied, and to assure them of permanency of
occupation. ”
The key-note of one form of opposition to this land bill was
struck on the morning of the debate in a manifesto issued and
published.by a distinguished member of the Melbourne Chamber
of Commerce. It was there pointed out with force and ability,
that the proposals of the Government did not come up to the real
importance and emergency of the situation. The great object of
the sharp contest respecting the land question, which began in the
old Legislative Council in 1852, was to get the use of the public
lands for the use and occupation of the incessant stream of
human beings that was then pouring into the colony, and not to
impose additional taxation on the squatters. The long and acri-
monious arguments on the rights of the squatters under the Orders


in Council, injurious or imaginary as they alternately appeared
to the rival parties, had been fought out and fairly won by the
advocates of the popular cause. And yet in spite of the inten-
sity of public opinion—in the face of the requirements of the
population, it was proposed to still further crystallize the old
system by giving the pastoral tenant seven years’ leases, with the
right of renewal - and compensation, the only consideration re-
served for the public being a slightly increased rent for the
42,000,000 acres of the people’s inheritence occupied by that
favored class.
The arguments against the bill were, however, carried much
further than this in the Assembly by Mr. (now Sir Archibald)
Michie and Mr (now Sir John) O’Shanassy. The stereotyped
contention that the Orders in Council of 1847 gave the existing
incumbents of squattages possession of the land for 14 years
absolutely, with the right of pre-emption, was grappled by Mr.
Michie, and the whole question dealt with in a manner that
singularly contrasted with his subsequent views on the land
problem. The squatters, he said, had not the rights now claimed ;
all that could be said in their favor was that the Orders in Council
gave the Governor power to grant leases for any term not exceed-
ing 14 years. Earl Grey, he reminded the House, had said that
leases could be granted for one year if the Governor liked. The
Governor had no other authority and never had any other than to
grant leases for any term not exceeding 14 years. The hon.
gentlemen advocating the squatters’ interest had interpreted the
Orders in their own favor, and had uniformly represented to the
people out of doors that the leases were granted for 14 years
absolutely. This was what was called the squatters’ “ rights.”
Then the hon. and learned member quoted the clear and unmis-
takable words of sections 1 and 9 of chapter 2 of the Orders in
Council of 9th March, 1847. He regretted to have lived to
see the day on which a minister of state had said it was expedient
to resort to a kind of spoliation in order to give certain people
their rights. That was what the case amounted to. If the
squatters took their leases under the Orders in Council they
would have to comply with ths conditions of the Orders in Council.
But they wanted to get leases under the Constitution Act, with-
out compliance with the conditions imposed by the Orders in
Council. It was not so much a question of law as policy. If
they granted these leases for 14 years, nothing in coming time
could stave off anarchy and confusion, for the public would never
submit to such an aggrandisement of a few. He therefore asked
members to pause, before they committed themselves to what
Avould prove the most lamentable error which had ever taken
place on this side of the globe. He proposed that the question


be referred to a select committee.
Mr. O’Shanassy complained that before the speecli of the
Surveyor-General not a word was said about the intention of the
Government to propose to grant eight years’ leases, nor was a
word said about the sale of auriferous land. There was nothing
in the ministerial proposals not contained in the Land Sale Act
of 1842.
The debate was adjourned, and then resumed on 22nd January,
1857, when the Attorney-General (Mr. Stawell) and Solicitor-
General (Mr. Fellows) intimated that the Government did not
intend to grant leases for seven years, but to lease from year to
year, the rent of runs to be adjusted every year. The Ministry
was then charged with a change of front. Dr. Greeves objected
to any form of leasing, as well as to the principle of deferred
payment. His proposal was that persons then in occupation of
crown land for pastoral purposes should be permitted to continue
their occupation, subject to a twelve months notice to quit. Mr.
J. M. Grant advocated a system of free selection, and the extinc-
tion of prior claims by equitable settlement. Eventually the
resolutions were adopted, with minor amendments. One impor-
tant amendment was that the committee considered it inexpedient
to authorise the issue of leases for crown lands for pastoral
purposes, but that it should be lawful to demise crown lands to
existing authorised occupants for pastoral purposes, at an acreable
rent of 2d. per acre. Another amendment suggested by Mr,
J. M. Grant was that pastoral lands should be reserved as a
commonage in the neighborhood of the sites of all the settled'
population of the country.
Captain Clarke did not remain in office long enough to bring in
a bill founded on the lines of these resolutions. On 4th March
the Ministry was defeated on an adverse vote proposed by Mr.
O’Shanassy, censuring them for mis-application of the vote for
immigration. Mr. O’Shanassy then formed an administration,
including himself, Chief Secretary, Mr. H. S, Chapman, Attorney-
General, Mr. J. V. F. Foster, Treasurer, Mr. (afterwards Sir
Charles) Gavan Duffy, Commissioner of Public Works, Mr.
Greeves, Commissioner of Trade and Customs. Mr Horne,
Commissioner of Land and Survey, and Mr J. Denistoun Wood,
Solicitor-General;
The new Ministry, which was destined to be one of short
duration, assumed office on 11th March, 1857, and the House
then adjourned till 15th April, when Mr. O’Shanassy returned to
the House with Messrs. Wood, Horne, Foster and Duffy. On
the same occasion the following newly-elected members took their
seats, viz; Messrs. Fellows, Goodman, Lbden, Sitwell, Service and
Heales. Mr. O’Shanassy and his colleagues had hardly taken


their seats on the Treasury benches when Mr. Fellows gave notice
of his intention to move a vote of want of confidence against
them. One of the grounds of attack was, that ministers had been
making undue promises of money grants to their constituents
during the elections ; but the principal cause of complaint was
that Mr. O’Shanassy had selected Mr. Foster as Treasurer. Mr.
Foster was at that time extremely unpopular, on account of his
conduct when Colonial Secretary, with reference to the alleged
mis-appropriation of £865,000 voted for immigration purposes,
and also on account of his alleged responsibility for the Ballarat
riots. The result was that a strong combination of parties took
place to oust Mr. O’Shanassy, and on 22nd April his Government
was defeated by 34 to 19. Mr. (afterwards Sir James) MUulloch
was entrusted with the formation of a new Ministry, and having
failed to prevail upon Mr. O’Shanassy to join him, he formed a
Government, with Mr. Haines as Chief Secretary, Mr. Michie,
Attorney-General, Mr Fellows, Solicitor-General, Mr. Ebden,
Treasurer, Mr. David Moore, Land and Works, Mr. W. H. F.
Mitchell (Upper House), Postmaster-General, and himself, Mr.
M‘Culloch, Commissioner of Trade and Customs.
The Government lost no time in bringing in a land bill, which
they had previously undertaken, should be based on the principles
affirmed by Captain Clarke’s resolutions already adopted. On
10th June, Mr. David Moore moved the second reading of the
bill. The main outlines of the bill were :—l. That town and
suburban lands should only be sold, as heretofore, by public
auction. 2. That country lands, after being once submitted to
public auction and withdrawn, the upset price being ascertained,
should be sold by private contract, 3. That the Orders in
Council should be repealed. 4, That squatters in licensed
occupation of waste lands should receive occupation certificates,
ffivinw them a kind of yearly possessory title at a yearly rent,
subject to adjustment every five years. 5. That the Government
should have the power to enter upon and survey, sell, or reduce
the measurement of a run ; but until required for sale or occupa-
tion for agricultural or other purposes, the lands comprised in a
run were to be occupied by the licensees. 6. That forfeited runs,
or runs for which higher rent was offered by outsiders at the end
of. the term, were to be submitted to public auction, provision
being made for compensation for improvements, 7. Penalties
were provided for trespassing on runs.
The bill encountered strenuous opposition in the country. The
Land League, with Mr. Wilson Gray, one of the foremost
champions of the people at that time, at its head, commenced a
determined and furious crusade against the measure. Demonstra-
tions were held in various centres of population, at which the


measure was denounced in unqualified terms. So great was its
unpopularity that petitions from all parts of the colony, signed
by about 70,000 persons, were presented to Parliament, protesting
against it. It was contended that its provisions virtually gave
the squatters a perpetuity of tenure, and did not promote settle-
ment of the people on the soil. The system of sale by auction
was objected to, on the ground that it was impossible for working
agricultural settlers to purchase at first hand from the State the
land they required, but it placed them at the mercy of those who
purchased on speculation. What was demanded was the right of
selecting lands, from any part of the unalienated public domain,
without reference to Government officers, untrammelled by the
necessity of survey before selection, and with the system of
deferred payments. It was complained that it was proposed to
give to a few gentlemen who had already made enormous fortunes
out of the comparatively free use of 42,000,000 acres a legal
claim to compensation. Mr. Fellows, the late counsel of the
Pastoral Association, it was said, had drawn the bill in their
favor, Mr. Michie was charged with deserting his colours.
The debate prior to the committal of the bill was of a most
exciting description. Mr. Puffy was its most determined and
bitter opponent. “ I pledge my life,” exclaimed the hon. member,
“ that it will never be carried. I believe, on my conscience, that
it is a swindle. I tell you that the minority, inch by inch, word
for word, letter for letter, will dispute it, and, if needed, will
carry it from the House to those who created this House the
people.” “The hon. member,” said Mr. Fellows, “has flattered
us by calling us swindlers; that is perhaps considered a compli.
ment in the eyes of his fellow-countrymen. Swindlers! that is
the language he addressed to us.” “ What I declared, explained
Mr. Duffy, “was that the attempt to convey the lands of the
country under the pretence of giving grazing leases to a class of
men in perpetuity was a swindle, and it is a swindle.” Further-
more, Mr. Duffy said he was pledged against compensation, and in
favor of a system of deferred payments (a). His scheme of land
reform also embraced the following proposal:—The industrious
people should be invited and stimulated to purchase laud. With
this view half the land at every sale ought to be put up in allot-
ments of 80, 160, and 320. He was not to be told that an
industrious man and his family could not live on 80 acres of land,
when he had seen the small proprietors of France and Belgium
living on less than 80 acres, sometimes of the poorest soil in
Europe. Mr. P. Lalor (the present Speaker of the Assembly)
said he was not an advocate for selling all agricultural lands by
auction. It was desirable to establish in this country a class of
{A) Hansard, vol. 1, p. 777.


peasant proprietors, as existed in Austria, Switzerland and the
United States. With regard to the squatters, he thought they
had certain rights under the Orders in Council, and they deserved
compensation from the Imperial Government. Mr. O’Shanassy
denied that the squatters had any rights under the Orders in
Council; he denied that such rights should have any existence or
Legislative effect. The bill was not framed in accordance with
the resolutions brought down by Captain Clarke, and amended
and adopted by the House. The Land Sales Act, 1847, did not
make it mandatory on the Governor to issue leases; their length
and conditions depended on the Governor’s discretion. There
was nothing in the bill to promote settlement by sale or selection.
He fully agreed with the objects aimed at by the Land League,
but he objected to the mode proposed to accomplish that end. He
objected to free selection and the taking up of small squattages
by poor men. The bill, moreover, placed no limit on the extent
of improvements which a squatter might carry out; a man of
capital might erect large buildings on a water frontage, and by
this means effectually shut out the public from entering on his
run. He (Mr. O’Shanassy) would never sell the water frontages.
(a). Mr. J. M. Grant said he believed the bill was a backward
step ; it contained no improvement on the old system. Diggers
were not permitted to enter upon runs in search of gold. No
person could enter a run in search of coal or minerals without the
sanction of the Board of Land and Works. Mr. R. Heales admitted
that the squatters had no rights under the Orders in Council, but
they were entitled to the first offer of their run at a fair rental.
He did not think the present bill gave the squatters leases of
their runs in perpetuity, for by clause 17 it would be legal to take
any portion of a run for purposes of sale. In his opinion the
system of selection favored land-jobbing. Lands should be open
to public competition in blocks of from 40 to 320 acres—always
ready for sale. If lands were required for mere investment, he,
as an individual, objected to its being taken from the squatters,
and he thought that the selector should give a kind of bond that
he required the land for cultivation or settlement. He would sup-
port the system of defended payments. Mr. Geo. Harker asked
what were they going to do with the people who came to the
colony, if they did not devise some other plan by which men could
get on the land without trouble 1 His suggestion was—let them
select land without consideration to the squatters’ claims, and let
them make a living if they could. Mr. Butler Cole Aspinall de-
clared that the purport of the bill would be to turn the whole
colony into a sheep walk, and he cordially invited the member for
Kilmore (Mr. O’Shanassy) to organize an opposition to the Min-
(a). Hansard, vol. 1, p, 790.


istry, so as to save the country from such a catastrophe as the
passing of the hill. Captain Clarke said the hill which he had
framed under the resolutions acknowledged no claims for compen-
sation on the part of the squatters. Nor did it propose to repeal
the Orders in Council. He wished to give the squatters a certain
fixity of tenure, and call upon them to pay such an amount of rent
as would compel them to abandon such portions of their runs as
they did not occupy with advantage. Mr. James Service said he
did not think the hill showed much evidence of statesmanship, and
ought not to pass in its existing form. The people complained
that whilst they could not get an acre to settle upon, the squatters
occupied vast acreages. He would advocate legislation that
would tend to settle the people on the land. Dr. Owens considered
that the bill was unworthy of the colony, and of the age in which
they lived. They had 400,000 people contending with 800 as to
who should possess the colony.
Although the ministry had a majority of the House de-
termined to support the hill, the speaking in its support was very
moderate, when compared with some of the brilliant speeches
made against it. The Solicitor-General denied that the hill gave
the squatters a title in perpetuity, and cited section 20, which he
contended, provided that the land comprised within a run could
be put up for sale immediately on its being required by the people
for occupation. The Chief Secretary asserted that purchasers de-
siring to get small allotments had an opportunity of doing so
under the existing law. The average extent of country allot-
ments purchased in 1853 was 196 acres, and in the first half of
1855, the average was reduced to 90 acres. The squatters had
certain rights which must be respected. Mr. Goodman considered
that the proposal to submit runs to public auction at the end of
every five years would only induce holders to over-stock, use, and
exhaust the land. This would ruin stock, and raise the price of
meat. Mr. (now Sir Charles) Sladen, contended that it would be
ungenerous to deny that the squatters had acquired certain un-
defined rights, and the basis of the bill was an equitable arrange-
ment with the then occupants. Mr. Colin Campbell thought the
settlement of the country would not be prevented by a system of
leasing, or by deferred payments, as it would tend to throw the
lands "into the hands of speculators, and would give the Govern-
ment an undue power. The land might, perhaps, be sold at a
fixed price, leaving it to the option of the purchaser to pay one
half of the purchase money, and leaving the other to be paid as
ground rent, equivalent to the interest on the sum due. This
would ensure them a continually increasing revenue, and would
leave the lands in the possession of those who settled on it. The
Commissioner of Customs pointed out, that the bill provided that


the land should be settled to the fullest possible extent, and that
no leases were to be granted to the squatters —only licensed oc-
cupation. He denied that clause 9 gave the squatters any fixity of
tenure, as the Government had power to go upon a run and sell it
to the last acre.
On the 19th June, the second reading of the bill was carried by
32 votes to 22. The division list was as follows :
Ayes, 32.-—-Messrs. Moore, Ebden, Haines, Fellows, Michie,
M‘Culloch, Goodman, Pasley, Anderson, Sladen, Service, Smith,
Embling, Heales, King, D. S. Campbell, 0. Campbell, Sargood,
Sitwell, Palmer, Lalor, Adamson, Beaver, Clarke, Griffith, Lang-
lands, Henty, Wills, Johnson, Ware, Quarterman and Davis.
Noes, 22.—Messrs. Humffray, Wood, Snodgrass, Blair, Brooke,
O’Shanassy, Horne, Syme, O’Brien, Duffy, Phelan, Myles, Read,
Owens, Rutherford, Aspinall, Harker, Grant, Fyfe, Evans, Hughes
and Foster.
The night of the division was one memorable in the history of
the Victorian Assembly. The vicinity of Parliament Houses was
thronged with excited persons, and inflammatory placards were
posted and circulated, warning the House not to pass the bill.
The opponents of the bill did their utmost to prevent its further
progress, and frequent motions for adjournment were proposed,
and negatived by the Ministerial majority. The sitting commenced
on Friday, 19th, at half-past four, and the House did not rise till
a quarter to twelve in the forenoon on Saturday, the 20th, having
sat for a period of 20 hours, short of a few minutes (a).
The bill was committed proforma on 23rd June. Meanwhile
public indignation was aroused to an intense pitch of excitement.
Petitions began to pour into the House from Richmond, Mary-
borough, Dunolly, Yackandandah, Kyneton, Prahran, Heathcotc,
Buninyong, Sandhurst, Belfast, Sebastopol, Tarrengower, Wan-
garatta, Ovens, Mount Blackwood, Emerald Hill, Geelong, Wom-
bat, Gipps Land and Warnambool.
One of the most conspicuous opponents of the measure not
occupying a seat in Parliament was Mr. Wilson Gray. This
gentleman has left behind him an enduring fame for his political
honor and consistency, his self-denying patriotism, and the ability
with which he grappled the absorbing problem of land reform. By
birth he was an Irishman, and by profession a barrister. Having
had a wide experience, obtained by travel in America and other
countries, he arrived in this colony in 1856 in the same vessel
which brought Mr. Charles Gavan Duffy to these shores. Imme-
diately on his arrival, Mr. Gray’s attention was directed to the
great question of Land Legislation, which he had seen fought out
in other young countries. He cast his political lot with the

struggling, popular party; nor, did he, for one moment, waver of
falter in the struggle, although he saw that he lost all hope of a
professional career here, hy doing so. Backed up by many ardent
spirits, he helped to form land leagues throughout the country, for
the purpose of advancing the cause of liberal legislation. “ Unlock
the Lands” was the watch-word of the party thus formed, which may
be regarded as the first definite organization of the Liberal party
in Victoria. They petitioned Parliament, and held indignation
meetings against the bill. The most important feature of their
opposition was the Land Convention, held in Melbourne in July,
1857. In the Convention, presided over by Mr. Gray, was con-
centrated the intelligent and irresistible opposition of the entire
country. Delegates from all parts of the colony assembled in
Melbourne, for the first time, on 15th July. On the evening of
that day 67 delegates met in conference. In a few days afterwards
the number of delegates was increased to 88. This Convention
constituted a virtual Parliament, sitting co-temporaneously with
the legal Parliament. The virtual Parliament represented the
feelings, instincts and sympathies of the nation. The majority in
the Assembly represented personal interest, and political corrup-
tion in its worst form. Whilst the clique in the Assembly was
bartering away the landed inheritance of the people—or to use the
graphic words of Mr, Michie in his wild tirade against Captain
Clarke’s resolution—“giving the heritage of their children for a
mess of pottage” (a), the Land Convention adopted the following
resolutions as the basis of a land bill suitable for the requirements
of the colonists :
1. Free selection for the actual settler, at one uniform
price without auction.
2, All unsold crown lands to form one open pasturage
free to the people.
3. No new pastoral tenancies to be created when land
occupied under license was resumed by the crown.
The principles embodied in these resolutions formed the alpha
and the omega of Liberal Land Reform Associations in Victoria
for many years, and Wilson Gray lived to see the majority of those
principles recognized in the statute book. Nor, were the labors
of the Convention without immediately good results.
The bill remained in committee for three months, and underwent
a considerable amount of modification and amendment. On the
third reading its principal provisions were as follows : —l. Repeal
of Orders in Council. 2. Licensed occupants to obtain certificates
of occupancy for pastoral purposes, on applying within three months
to hold their runs against all squatters fortwo and a-half years in the
intermediate districts, and for five years in unsettled districts; rent

,£25 per year for every 1000 sheep or 200 head q£ cattle, runs were
capable of depasturing, to be estimated by arbitration. 3At the
end of terms of two years and a-hal£ and live years respectively,
runs to be put up to auction, to give new comers an opportunity of
competing with old occupiers. New tenants to be compelled to
take the stock and improvements on runs they purchase, at a valua-
tion and cash payment. 4 Old and new tenants to be liable to
have their runs entered upon by persons wishing to seek for metals,
to cut drains, or watercourses, and to take timber or stone. 5.
Portions of runs near townships to be taken for commonage pur-
poses without compensation. 6. Licensed land to be liable to bo
entered upon by the Crown, when required for public purposes;
unoccupied and unlicensed land, or forfeited licensed land, to be
exposed to public auction, and let in runs on certificate. I. Exist-
ing agriculturalists to be able to put up for auction any portion of
a squatter’s run, adjoining his own land. 8. A moiety of country
lands to be divided into special lots of from 20 to 160 acres, two
lots to adjoin one another, and a purchaser of a special lot to occupy
adjoining lot for five years, for pastoral purposes, at a rent of 6 per
cent, of price of purchased lot; new clause proposed by Mr, Heales,
and supported by the Government. 9. Town and suburban land to
be sold by auction; country land if not bought when offered at
auction, to be sold by private contract, upset price not less than
£1 per acre, one fourth of purchase money to be paid at sale and
the remainder, within a month.
The third reading was carried by a majority of 30 to 23, the
division list being as follows ;
Ayes. Messrs. Moore, Clarke, Ebden, Haines, Michie, Adam-
son, Goodman, Sitwell, Anderson, Heales, Sladen, M‘Culloch,
Service, Smith Rutledge, Sargood, H. S. Campbell, Findlay, Beaver,
Embling, Henty, Langlands, Griffith, Wills, Johnson, C. Campbell,
Ware, Davis, Quarterman, Lalor.
Noes.—Messrs. Wood, Blair, Ireland, Syme, Fife, Owens, Evans,
Wilkie, Brooke, Greeves, Hughes, Grant, Hancock, Harker, Phelan,
Duffy, Aspinall, Myles, O’Brien, Foster, O’Shannassy, Snodgrass,
and Humffray. #
On the 23rd September the bill was debated in the Upper
House, the second reading being moved by Mr. (now Sir W. F.)
Mitchell, the ministerial representative, who, in doing so, described
it as the People’s Bill, the Working Man’s Charter. Unfortu-
nately the hon. member did not disclose much grounds for so de-
scribing it. Mr. Fawkner moved that the bill be read a second
time that day six months, and took the opportunity of making an
attack on the squatters, the equal to which is perhaps not to be
found on record in Hansard. In taking this stand he denied that he
vol. 1. p. 1213.


Was allying himself with the Land Convention. In fact he held the
Convention in contempt, as they wanted the land of -the colony
to be thrown open as one vast commonage. He objected to the
bill because it perpetuated the old squatting monopoly, under
which the colony had been groaning for many years. If the bill did
not give the squatters all they expected, it gave them the means of
preventing the settlement of the country for many years to come.
He believed the interest of the colony would be best served by the
land being leased or sold in small blocks from year to year. The
squatters opposed the clause which allowed a poor man to lease an
adjoining allotment at 6 per cent, of the market price, but he
contended that the whole lands of the colony should be so let.
Mr. Henry Miller declared that the bill would neither suit the
miner, the agriculturalist, nor the squatter. He objected to
conferring rights on the squatters which they were not entitled to,
and which would involve great loss and expense to the country. In
support of his contention he quoted the Duke of Newcastle’s
despatch. Their licenses were not intended to facilitate their
indulging in land speculation ; least of all was it intended that
their temporary occupation should be allowed to impede the
progress of the country. A good argument against the valuation
proposals was supplied by Mr. Miller. He pointed out that the
whole of the leased runs would be put up for sale at the end of two
years and a-half and five years. To purchase the stock and
improvements of these vast properties would take millions of money,
and the money must be paid down at once. Who could pay such
enormous valuations as £77,000, to which men like Mr. Edward
Henty would be entitled 1 The bill in fact would hand the land
over to the squatters. On this ground alone the bill should be
thrown out. This was a very high stand to take, and it was all the
more forcible coming from Mr. Miller, who, when in the old Council,
voted for the abolition of the assessment on stock.
Mr. Hood considered that the bill would not produce the revenue
expected, and its details were defective. He knew one person who
would pay Is. per acre per year in advance for all the unsold land
in his district, and no doubt others would be equally ready. Mr.
Hodgson thought it was a matter of perfect indifference to the
squatters whether the bill passed or not, and as it was opposed by
the people he would vote for the amendment. Dr. Tierney supported
the amendment, as the bill virtually gave the squatters a tenure of
10 years, and the mode of arbitration was worthless, leaving room
for the squatters to bribe the arbitrators. Mr. Urquhart said the
squatters had been unjustly charged Avith being parties to a
compromise, and he would vote against the bill. Mr. Guthridge
pointed out that, judging from the number of petitions pre*


sented to Parliament against the bill, nine-tenths of the
whole population had protested. It would be monstrous to pass
a bill in the face of such a fact. Mr. McCombie in a long and able
speech condemned the bill as containing every bad feature in the
old squatting system, with no redeeming clause interposed to
render it practicable and likely to promote public interest. Messrs.
Strachan and Power were the only private members who spoke
in favor of the bill. The result of the division was that the
amendment was carried by 21 to 6 votes. The bill was therefore
lost. The Convention was triumphant. The country rejoiced at
having escaped the calamity of a bill which was even denounced in
the Council by friends and foes of the squatting party.
The session terminated on 24th November, but Parliament was
again opened on 3rd December for the purpose of passing the
estimates, and several measures for the reform of the constitution of
the Assembly prior to a general election, it being generally conceded
that the House should be reformed, and an appeal made to the
constituencies before the land question was again tackled. This
led to a postponement of the settlement of'the matter for three
years. In view of this a bill was passed for the purpose of increas-
ing the assessment on stock depastured on crown lands in licensed
occupation. The assessment was fixed at 9d. per head on sheep,
3s. per head on cattle, and 6s. per head on horses, making a total
estimated revenue of £260,000 per annum.
The Government introduced three measures of constitutional
reform this session. The first was the duration of Assembly Bill,
reducing the term of existence of the Assembly from five to three
years. This was passed by both Houses but not by absolute majori-
ties and could not be reserved for the Queen’s Assent. The second
bill was the Increase of Members Bill. The third bill was the
Election Regulation Bill. This measure was framed on the principle
of the representation of minorities. The Assembly Members’ Increase
Bill provided the mode in which the district should be divided
and represented. It proposed that the division should be based
mainly on population. The colony was divided into 22 districts
set forth in the schedule, each to return a certain number of
members according to the population of the district. The clauses
of the bill having been passed, Mr. Haines moved that the schedule
be adopted, offering to consent to its amendment in any way hon.
members wished. Captain Clarke opposed the schedule, as tending
to centralize the electoral power in Melbourne and disfranchise
distant constituencies, and he proposed a new distribution, giving
either 2,3, or 5 members to each district, allowing the principle of
cumulative votes in order to secure the representation of minorities,
preserving existing districts and creating new districts. The amend-
ment was on a division carried by 26 to 17, Messrs. O’Shanassy


ami Duffy voting with the Government, and Mr. Chapman not taking
part in the division. Great surprise was expressed at the result of
the division by Mr. Haines and Mr. O’Shanassy; and several hon.
members were charged with having violated the principles they
professed to hold. Mr. Haines moved that progress be reported, and
next day, 24th February, the government resigned.
Mr. Chapman, who had opposed the representation of minorities,
was called upon by Sir Henry Barkley to form an administration,
and he performed the task. He appointed his old chief, Mi.
o‘Shanassy, to the post of Chief Secretary, himself taking the
Attorney-Generalship, the other offices being allotted as follows;
Mr. Ireland, Solicitor-General; Mr. Barker, Treasurer; Mr. Duffy,
Land and Works ; Mr. Miller, Trade and Customs; Dr. Evans,
Postmaster General. Thus came into existence the second O’Shan-
assy ministry.
A new bill was brought in to alter the electoral districts, in-
creasing them to 38, and to increase the number of members of
the Assembly to 88, eliminating the principle of representation of
minorities. The bill was passed through the Assembly, but re-
jected by the Council. In order that the Electoral till and the
Duration of Assembly Bill might become law before an appeal to
the country on the Land Bill, a third session of parliament was in-
augurated, and these two measures were re-introduced, and passed
through the Assembly, and were again sent to the Council. The
Assembly Duration Bill was passed (without ’amendment) by
absolute majorities, and became law. The Electoral till was
amended and passed. The session was prolonged till the 24th
February, 1859, owing to other important measures having in the
meantime engaged the attention of Parliament.
Prior to the prorogation, with a view to dissolution, Mr . O Shan-
assy, in compliance with a promise, explained to the House that
the Ministry had agreed to a general plan of the land system,
which they intended to submit to the next Parliament. It was
intended that the measure should embrace the following pro-
visions :—l. That large areas of agricultural land shall be pro
claimed near the chief centres of population, within which areas
ordinary farm lots, in no case exceeding 320 acres, will be open
to selection by bond fide settlers, without auction, at a fixed price
of £1 per acre. 2. That within these areas the unsold land shall
constitute a free commonage for the settlers, subject to regulations
to be made in an agricultural municipality. 3. That an en-
larged municipal system be constructed, embracing agricultural
districts as well as towns, under which system the inhabi-
tants will possess a direct control over the local expenditure
for public purposes, at present defrayed out of the general
revenue, such municipalities to obtain a certain proportion of en-


dowment cut of the public estate, and the power of levying an
equitable taxation on fixed property, in lieu of the grants in aid
now provided for out of the Estimates. 4, That common
pasturage be secured by law to the inhabitants of all towns and
gold-fields where Crown lands exist. 5. That water frontages
throughout the interior be reserved in perpetuity for public use.
6. That all auriferous land be reserved from sale. 7. That all
town and suburban lands, and such other lands as may be ren-
dered peculiarly valuable by their position shall continue to be
sold at public auction ; and that provision be made for bond fide
settlers who may require larger allotments than are provided for
in the agricultural areas. 8. That at a period to be fixed by law
all preferable occupancy of the public domain by the pastoral
tenants now in possession shall absolutely cease and determine.
9. That in the meantime the pastoral tenants shall continue to
receive an annual licence , revocable on such notice, and held at
such rent, as the Legislature may determine.” “ I also, Sir, deem
it my duty ” (said Mr. O’Shanassy) “tp state that there are one
or two special points on which two members of the Government
desire me to express their opinions. Ido so, because it would be
unfair to them if these opinions were not stated to the public.
One member of the Cabinet would wish to make the experiment
of deferred payments in one area ; and in reference to the prin-
ciple of selection within specified areas , another member of the
Cabinet would prefer the application of the principle to the whole
country. But both, rather than risk the success of a Bill based
on the principles already stated, would support the proposed
measure,”
So closed the first Parliament of Victoria under the new con-
stitution. Three Ministries had been in office, and neither of
them had succeeded in solving the vital question of land reform.
The people must be uoav appealed to. In this momentous crisis
the people looked for leaders both in Parliament and in the
country, Mr. Gray and his friends in the Convention had done
their work well and nobly, but Mr. Gray did not want to enter
Parliament; he considered that his work lay in organising and
educating the party out of Parliament, and in vigilantly watching
the proceedings of Parliament. At this juncture all eyes were
directed to Mr. William Nicholson as a possible future leader.
Who was Mr, Nicholson ! He was the son of a small Cumberland
farmer, and was according to the early chronicles (*) a self-made
man. He arrived in the colony in the year 1842, and for a con-
siderable time he kept a grocer’s shop in Little Coliins-street, at
the rear of the Congregational Church. Afterwards he opened a
more pretentious establishment in Big Coliins-street. When the

gold discoveries broke out the small trader developed into a great
merchant. He became a squatter’s agent, and a bank director.
In 1850 lie was City Councillor, and became the Mayor of Mel-
bourne, About the same period he was returned to the old Legis-
lative Council as member for North Bourke. The subject in
which he interested himself, which laid the foundation of his
Parliamentary fortunes, was the ballot—that delicate and im-
portant piece of political machinery so neatly described by Cicero
as the silent asserter of liberty, tabella vindex tacita Übertatis. In
committee on the Electoral Bill, 18th December, 1855, he carried
his ballot clause by 33 to 25 votes. The administration of Mr.
W. Clark Haines having opposed it, tendered their resignation,
and Mr. Nicholson was suddenly astonished to find himself called
upon to cany on the Queen’s Government. He failed to form a
ministry, and ignominiously surrendered the task, not from the
want of material or opportunity, but from sheer want of moral
courage, Mn Haines and his colleagues returned to office. Shortly
after this Mr. Nicholson visited England, where he was entertained
at a brilliant soiree held at the Freemasons’ Hotel. Mr. John
Bright and Mr. Richard Cobden were present. Mr. Nicholsoi!
was hailed as the founder of “ vote by ballot.” In July, 1858, the
lion, gentleman returned to the colony. His return was looked
upon with interest by all parties. The convention men welcomed
him, and Mr. O'Shanassy, whose Ministry was at that time very
shaky, held out overtures to him, but Mr. Nicholson refused to
serve under the Kilmore banner. His principles and popularity
were soon put to the test. An election, caused by the resignation
of Captain Clarke, took place at North Melbourne shortly after his
arrival. Mr. Nicholson contested the seat against Mr. Robert
Sterling Anderson. Mr. Nicholson’s professions of liberalism,
however, were not trusted, and Mr, Anderson was returned as a
supporter of the O’Shanassy Ministry. Mr. Nichols/u then took
a leading part in forming the Constitutional Association, of which
he became chairman. The principal object of that organisation was
to destroy the O’Shanassy Government at the forthcoming election.
That Administration had already outlived its popularity and useful-
ness. The gross act of political immorality witnessed by . the
country in Mr. O’Shanassy voting with Mr. Haines in the division
which caused that gentleman’s defeat, and then becoming the head
of a new administration even at the sacrifice of his hobby—the
representation of minorities—was never forgotten, and could never
be forgiven. Consequently towards the close of the session the
Ministry was tottering almost to destruction. Nevertheless, they
were allowed to go to the country.
The general election took place in batches. The result was that
the Government sustained a most crushing defeat. Four Ministers


were rejected by their old constituents. All of them, however,
except the Attorney-General, managed to secure other seats. The
House was opened on 18th October, 1859. There were only 22
members on the Ministerial side, whilst 44 were arrayed on the
Opposition benches. The Convention party was well represented.
The extermination of the O’Shanassy Ministry was the first per-
formance of the session resolved upon. Mr. Nicholson was selcted
to lead the onslaught. Accordingly, he moved an amendment to
the address in reply. The charges levelled against the Ministry
were—That they had wilfully and needlessly delayed the meeting
of Parliament; that they had disgracefully exercised the patron-
age of the country, and packed the service with their friends and
supporters; that several members of the Government occupied
improper financial relations with Mr. Bruce, the railway contractor;
that they had disproportionately divided the money voted for
education ; that they had unconstitutionally spent public money
on unauthorised works ; that they had improperly reprieved a
murderer named Regan because he was a Catholic, and that their
conduct generally had been an insult and a disgrace to the country,
Mr. O’Shanassy replied in a speech of masterly ability and impas-
sioned eloquence, but without avail. Matters were very much
complicated by the resignation of Mr. Duffy during the recess, he
having had a mis-understanding with the premier, Mr. Duffy
alleging that he had to retire because he failed to comply with the
request of his chief to throw more land into the market. The
result of the division was an overwhelming majority against the
Kilmore ministry. For them, 17; against them, 56—majority, 39.
Mr. Nicholson now came to the front. He formed an Administra-
tion as follows;—Mr. Nicholson, Chief Secretary ; Mr. M‘Culloch,
Treasurer ; Attorney-General, Mr. J. Denistoun Wood ; Minister
of Lands, Mr. Service ; Commissioner of Public Works, Mr. J. C.
King ; Solicitor-General, Mr. Adamson (without a seat in the
House) ; Commissioner of Trade and Customs, Mr. Pyke ; Post-
master-General, Mr. Bailey. Mr. Duffy was asked to join as
Minister of Lands. He drew up a memorandum setting forth
his land policy, which he submitted to Mr. Nicholson; —“ 1. That the
first measure of the new Government shall be a Land Bill including
the provisions of the bill promulgated by the late Government with
the addition of an adequate arrangement for the gold-fields and
agricultural districts, with free commonage. 2. That the squatting
tenure should terminate in 1861. The use of the public grass to
be provided for in a separate bill, the opinion of the members of
the Liberal party joining the Government being that all exclusive
right of occupation should then terminate, but that the use of the
grass may be subject to assessment.” Mr. Nicholson assented to this.
Mr. Duffy next wished to stipulate that Mr, Brook, Mr. Anderson,


and Mr. Hood, as representatives of the popular party, should have
office with him. Mr. Nicholson ottered to take in Mr. Brook, and
at that point negotiations were broken off, and Mr. Nicholson
secured Mr. Service as his Minister of Lands.


CHAPTER 111.
THE NICHOLSON LAND ACT.
When the Haines’ Land Bill was in committee, Mr. Service
moved the insertion of a clause which he described as intended “to
afford facilities to persons of limited means desirous of settling
down to agricultural or pastoral persuits.” It was to the effect
that there should be surveyed and marked off in various parts of
the colony, and in such localities as should be deemed most suit-
able without interfering with town or suburban classes, certain
lands to be called “farm lands.” These lands were to be divided
into blocks of a certain area (undefined by the clause), and any person
was to be allowed to select a block not previously taken up, at the
upset price of 20s. per acre, subject to regulations. This clause was
not adopted, as it found only seven supporters besides the mover.
However, when Mr. Service moved the second reading of the
Nicholson Land Bill (10th January, 1860), he claimed the credit
of having three years previously introduced to the notice of the
House one of the principal features of the bill, viz., the principle
of free selection at an uniform fixed price. Other resolutions
which did not come on for debate, consequent on the defeat of the
principal clause, contained, Mr. Service said, the conditions of
deferred payments. “So that,” said he, “in point of fact the two
main features on which the Land Bill is based were advocated by me
three years ago. Sir, I may come before the House without being
charged by any lion, members with inconsistency or with a desire
to advocate a doctrine for any other reason than that I think it is
the one most conducive to the interests and prosperity of the country
at large” (a). It will be interesting to note how far the bill itself
tallied with this announcement of its fundamental principles.
Subjoined is a synopsis of its leading provisions:—
Free Selection after Survey.— The chief feature of the bill
was that of free selection over all the waste lands of the Crown in the
cplony for agricultural purposes, subject to certain conditions with
(a) Victorian Hansard, vol 5, p 263.


respect to'land not surveyed and special lands which might he of
special value. “ Total abolition of the sale of ordinary country
lands by auction” Avas proclamed as one of its cardinal provisions.
The Board of Land and Works was from time to time to cause
country lands to be surveyed to the amount of 4,000,000 acres, in
allotments of not less than 80, nor more than 320 acres each. Plans
were to be prepared and each allotment divided into four equal
portions. Advertisements were then to be inserted in the neAvs-
papers published nearest to the lands so surveyed, notifying that
applications would be received for any such allotments up to a
certain day not less than a month before the date of such proclama-
tion. Any person desirous of purchasing any of such allotments were
requested on or before the last day on Avhich applications could be
received to send in an application in the form of a schedule of the
act. At noon on the day named in the proclamation for opening, the
person appointed opened the applications in the presence of the appli-
cants or their agents, and publicly stated the number of the allot-
ments applied for. If their Avas only one applicant for an allotment
he was declared the selector thereof, provided he had duly paid a
deposit at the rate of £1 on every 4 acres applied for ; if there were
tAvo or more applications for the same allotmentthen it Avas to be sold
by tender, at which sale only the applicants werealloAved to tender.
Every person thus declared the selector of an allotment had
forthwith to name the sub-division which he elected to pur-
chase. Then he was deemed the purchaser of such sub-division,
and stated whether he Avould purchase or rent all or any of the
remaining sub-divisions. If he elected to purchase he paid the-
same price for every sub-division as he paid for the sub-division,
Avhich he lirst elected to purchase. If he elected to rent all or any
of the remaining sub-divisions he paid one year’s rent in advance,
at the rate of Is. 6d. per acre. If the selector did not elect to rent
or purchase the remaining sub-divisions they Avere sold by auction,
in which only unsuccessful applicants Avere allowed to bid. No
person declared a selector was entitled to tender for any other
allotment included in the same proclamation for which two or more
applications for any sub-division thereof had been received. After
the day fixed for determining applications, the person who
made first application for an unsold allotment or sub-division
thereof, and avlxo duly paid not less than one sub-division’s purchase
money at the rate of 20s. per acre, was declared the selector. Every
applicant was bound to make a deposit at the rate of <£l for
every four acres contained in the allotment applied for. No
person was entitled to be the selector of more than 340 acres within
a year after the date of the proclamation of a district in which he
had selected. Any person declared a selector was entitled at the
time he named the sub-division or sub-divisions Avhich he elected


to purchase to demand a lease of the remaining sub-division or sub-
divisions of such allotment. ' Every lease so granted commenced
from payment of the first year’s rent, and was for such term not
less than live nor more than ten years, as the Governor by procla-
mation shall have appointed. The rent was Is. 6d. per acre per
year, payable in advance. The purchased and leased land together
was not to exceed 320 acres.
Forfeiture.— Every lease was forfeited if the lessee did not
within a year of its commencement effect on the purchased
land, on the same allotment, improvements of the value of £1 per
acre of such purchased sub-division or sub-divisions. It was likewise
forfeited if the lessee used the rented land for any purpose except
agricultural and pastoral purposes, or as a garden, or if the lessee
failed to pay rent in advance, or if he became insolvent or mort-
gaged, assigned or sub-let such rented land, or if the same was sold
under execution, or if he or his agent had not resided either on
the rented land or on one of the purchased sub-divisions of the same
allotments at least 200 days every year. Forfeited lands were
again thrown open for selection. Clause 49 was an important one.
It provided that any person who, within a year after he purchased
or applied for an allotment of country land, entered into an agree-
ment to sell or mortgage such allotment, or buy or rent it on behalf
of another party, or borrowed money on its security, should be liable
to a penalty of £2OO, to be recovered in the Supreme Court by any
informers ; “and every such agreement or any conveyance, lease, or
mortgage or other charge made on, or security given over such
lands or any part thereof within one year after any such purchase,”
Avas declared void. The object of this clause Avas to prevent
dummyism.
Purchase of Leased Land. —The lessee at any time during
term could purchase the land comprised in his lease at the same
rate as that Avhich he paid for the sub-division originally purchased,
If the leased land Avas not purchased the lessee was not entitled to
compensation for improvements, but he could remove the improve-
ments Avithin a certain time.
Free Selection before Survey.—lf four or more persons paid
£416, being £320 for purchase money, and £96 for one year’s
rent, they could apply to purchase at the upset price of £1 per
acre, not less than 320 acres of the country unsurveyed at the time
of payment; and could rent at 2s. per acre an additional quantity
of land such as should, Avith the allotment purchased, amount to
1280 acres, subject to certain conditions, including fencing. The
GoA r ernor-in-Council Avas, hoAvever, empoAvered to refuse to survey,
sell or lease such land without assigning reasons.
Penalty for not Improving. — lf within tAvo years after the
purchase of any country land, improvements had not been affected on


the lancl so purchased equal in pounds sterling to twice the number
of acres comprised in the purchased portion of the allotment, the
purchaser or his successor was liable to a penalty of ss. per acre, to be
recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction, half the penalty to
go to the informer. The Governor-in-Council could, however, order
that such should not be recovered.
Commonage.— —The Governor-in-Council was authorised to proclaim
that any Crown lands in the vicinity of a town should be a com-
mon for the use of the inhabitants of such town, and from the piocla-
mation of a common, all the inhabitants were entitled to depasture
their cattle and horses upon it—to be called a “ town common.
Similar power was given to proclaim any Crown lands near a gold-
field as a common for the use of holders of miners’ rights, business
licenses and carriers’ licenses residing on the gold-fields—to be
called “ a gold-fields common.” On the petition of 25 occupiers of
purchased land in any agricultural district comprising not less than
500 acres, the Governor-in-Council was authorised to proclaim that
any Crown lands in the vicinity should be “ a farmers common.
Such persons received licenses, and had to pay certain fees for
pasturage, at the rate of 4s. for every horse and 2s. for every head
of cattle.
Licenses to Occupy.— The board was authorised to grant
licenses to occupy, for terms not exceeding seven years, crown lands
as sites of inns, stores, bridges or ferries, and toll or punt houses, or
for the working of mineral springs, or for such other purposes as
might appear to the board to be for the public advantage or con-
venience, at such yearly fees as the board fixed. This section is
worth noticing, as it proved to be one of great power and import-
ance in the administration of the land law as subsequently emas-
culated (a).
Water Frontages. —No water frontages or auriferous land were
to be alienated, but the Governor-in-Oouncil could sell auriferous
and mineral land in town allotments when it was for public con-
venience to do so.
Special Lands. —Special lands were lands within 20 miles of
Melbourne or Geelong, or within a certain distance of places men-
tioned in the schedule, or within certain distances of the River
Murray or a railway, or within a mile of purchased land. Once at
least every quarter public sales by auction of special lands were to be
held. The upset price of special lands was fixed at 205., subject to
increase by the Governor-in-Council. Purchasers had to make a
deposit of 25 per cent, of the purchase money at the time of sale,
the sale to be completed within four weeks subsequently.
General Provisions.— Several clauses gave the Government
power to take, use and apply and protect lauds for public purposes,
(a) See chapter on Occupation License*.


such as roads, races, drains, dams, reservoirs, etc.; to lease lands for
mining for any mineral or metal except gold and silver, and to grant
licenses to enter crown lands to search for metals or minerals except
gold ; to grant permit to enter Crown lands for purpose of surveying
and cutting drains, races, dams, or reservoirs; to issue licenses to
cut timber on Crown lands, or to dig for gravel, stone, salt, guano,
«fec. Penalties were provided for unauthorised occupation of Crown
lands.
The operation of these main clauses of this Land Bill may be thus
illustrated : Country lands vere surveyed in allotments of from 80 to
320 acres each, and each allotment was sub-divided into four parts.
No one could apply for a block of less than 80 acres in extent nor
more than 320. If he paid £1 cash for one fourth of an allotment,
say 20 acres of an 80 acre block, or 80 acres for a 320 acre block,
he was allowed to lease the remaining three sub-divisions of the
allotment at Is. 6d. per acre. This; then, was free selection after
survey, and, according to Mr. Service’s “deferred payment.” No
person could select more than one allotment within 12 months. A
tax of ss. per acre was imposed upon alienated land not cultivated
in accordance with the condition of grant. The only approach to
anything like free selection before survey was a series of clauses
providing for an arrangement of this kind. Four or more persons
could select 320 acres of unsurveyed land, pay £320 purchase
money and £96 for rent. They were then entitled to apply to pur-
chase the 320 acres and to rent an additional 960 acres at 2s. per
acre. These were called the “ special survey clauses.”
The bill contained no reference whatever to the squatters’ tenancy.
The Minister of Lands announced that the Government considered
that the question of the occupation of lands by the pastoral tenants
should be dealt with by separate bill, and in the meantime it could
be referred to a select committee.
Whatever were the imperfections of this bill there can be hardly
any doubt that it went a long way towards giving practical expres-
sion to the land policy promulgated by the apostles of the Conven-
tion ; and that it contained the feeble germ which subsequently
developed into the liberal land laws of this country. Although its
provisions did not come up to the demands of the Convention, the bill
professed to be modelled in harmony with the cardinal doctrines of
the Convention—free selection before and after survey, abolition of
the auction system as applied to agricultural lands, free commonage,
and deferred payments. Let us see how far these were justified.
The Convention party advocated the abolition of the sale of
country lands by auction, and substitution of selection at an uniform
upset price, with deferred payments. They objected to the auction
system, on the ground that it favored capitalists, and tended to the
centralisation and aggregation of large territories in a few hands,


whilst free selection favored the industrial classes, and promoted
the settlement and cultivation of the soil. The competition at
auction was uncertain, and a poor man had no chance of bidding
against a rich man. It was no reply to say that the State should
sell its land at the highest price. The experience of all young
countries (Canada and the United States in particular) had been
that to promote the settlement upon the soil of an industrial,
cultivating, consuming and tax-paying population was more con-
ducive to national prosperity than the mere exaction of a big upset
price for the national domain. The great advantage of free selection
before survey was that a settler could select any unoccupied block
of land which in his opinion suited his purposes and his means. He
could do his own exploration and pioneering, and reap the benefit
of any discovery of rich track of country which he might make.
He was the best judge of his own interests. The system of “ selec-
tion after survey” led to a general scramble for land ; but, what
was Avorse, it made the settlers dependent upon the caprice of
surveyors and Ministers. They Avould be able only to cultivate in
localities picked for them by a political department. This, it Avas
contended Avas unfair and impolitic, and was a serious obstacle to
settlement. It could only be remedied by having millions of acres
surveyed in adA’ance of settlement, and that Avas impossible in the
existing state of the colony, Avith such enormous demands for laud.
Survey Avould ahvays be lagging behind the applications for land.
The principle of “ deferred payment,” or “ time payment,” as
applied to land, necessarily went hand in hand with free selection
at an uniform price. A poor man or a beginner could neither afford
to compete at auction against rich purchasers, nor could he
afford to lay out all his capital in buying his homestead. He Avanted
a little working capital to tide over a feAv seasons—then he Avould
be able to pay off the balance of his purchase money. To extract
from the settler the Avhole of the purchase money of his land at the
outset Avould be, perhaps, to take aAvay from him the only means he
had of supporting himself and family, and launching his venture at
a period when a little money Avas most required. Such a course
would deprive him of the means of maintaining that vigorous state of
health and spirits Avhich is so necessary Avhen a man is engaged in
the diffcult task of clearing the land (a). Deferred payments Avas
the key-stone of the Canadian and the United States land system.
The system of deferred payments, it was urged, Avould have to be
established in Victoria if it was to be a democratic country. “ The
first step,” said Mr. Wilson Gray, “ is a great deal, and cultivation
should be assisted as much as possible in their Aveakest day, or it
Avould be useless to throw open the lands. The same will refer
to everything in life, and there Avere many men in the House Avho

had risen to their present positions hy their own exertions, who
would not have done so, had they been opposed at the lirst three or
four steps they took of the ladder” (a). “Why should poor men
be encouraged to take up land at all 1 ” cried the opponents of
deferred payments. The reply was, that it was desirable to estab-
lish, in this country, a class of cultivating proprietors. The history
of the world proved that, “ a bold peasantry, its country’s pride,”
had been the bulwarks and backbone of every country in which
such a class had an existence. It was that class which conquered
at Cressy and Agincourt, for the yeomen of England at that time,
were virtually peasant proprietors. They felt that their title
was permanent as long as they performed their military duty.
According to Fortescue, the golden age of English yeomanry was
shortly after the reign of Henry VI,, when there were more peasant
proprietors or leaseholders cultivating the soil than in any other
country in Europe. The peasant proprietors of Austria and
Switzerland had proved themselves to be, both in times of war and
peace, the most powerful and patriotic classes of those nations. In
the United States of America, experience showed that the great
success and power of the union lay in the tillers of the soil (b).
“ Free grass” or “ free commonage ” was an item of the Conven-
tion progamme that was much mis-understood. Of course, it was
coupled with the abolition of the squatting tenures, and meant that
every farmer and settler should be at liberty to run his flocks and
herds in adjacent Crown Lands as was the custom in California.
The Convention party, whilst accepting the Nicholson Land
Bill as an instalment of land reform, objected that it did hot
comply with the foregoing principles, which they considered as
essential preliminaries to any successful Land Legislation. The
Bill, it was said, did not remove some of the main impediments to
free selection. If several persons sent in applications for the same
allotment the applicants competed for it by tender. This was only
another form of sale by auction, and was a fatal blemish. Where
several applied for the same allotment, the difficulty, it was argued,
should be settled by lot, as the fairest means. The conditions
annexed to special survey, rendered selection before survey almost
impracticable. It would be difficult, sometimes, for a man want
ing to select a block to get three others to join him. Besides the
compulsory fencing would practically render the provisions nuga-
tory. The fencing clauses were intended simply to accommodate
the Crown tenant not being necessary for cultivating. In some
of the best parts of Europe, it was pointed out, the lands were
unfenced for miles. Then how could it be said that there was a

recognition of anything like deferred payments, when a selector,
after survey, had to pay one fourth of the purchase money, and a
years’ rent of the remaining sub-divisions in advance; and when a
selector before survey had to pay the whole of the purchase money
of 320 acres in advance 1
The greatest objection, however, taken to the Bill by the
Liberal party in the Assembly was the glaring omission of all
reference to the squatting tenure. The Government in shirking
this responsibility were charged with moral cowardice, and a gross
breach of faith with the public, inasmuch as they had by their pro-
fessions prior to the Ministerial elections led to the belief that they
would in their Land Bill provide for the termination of the squat-
ters’ licenses in 1861.
On the second reading, the most prominent speakers representing
the views of the Convention were Messrs. Duffy, Heales, Barton,
Don, o‘Hea and Wilson Gray. Mr. Duffy made a very able speech,
in which he fully and lucidly critcised the Bill. Mr. Heales con-
sidered that the measure was not so comprehensive and liberal as
the Haines Bill. Mr. Gray took his seat on the 12th January as
successor of Mr. John Everard in the representation of Rodney.
On the 13th, he delivered his maiden speech, which was a
very masterley criticism of the Ministerial scheme. He charged
the Government with intending to abandon the special survey
clauses, and condemned them for not dealing with the squat-
ting question. On the Ministerial side, the principal orators
were Mr. Michie, Mr. Bailey, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Wood. Mr.
O’Shanassy spoke in very hostile terms against deferred payments,
uniform price, free selection, and advocated the sale of large blocks,
say 1000 acres. Mr. John Woods said that if he ever had any
doubt as to whether he acted rightly in voting against the late
Government, this speech of the hon. member for Kilmore had
quite absolved him from any regret on the subject.
The second reading of the Bill was carried without a division. Two
important amendments were made in committee. In clause 21, the
words “but if there be two or more applications for the same allot-
ment, then, such allotment, shall be forthwith sold by tender, at
which sale only tire persons who shall have made applications for
such allotment, or their agents, appointed in writing, shall be
allowed to tender,” were struck out, and on the motion of Mr.
Duffy, carried by a majority of 24 to 20, the following provision
was substituted :—“Such persons as shall be appointed for the pur-
pose, shall cause lots to be drawn by the persons making such ap-
plications in such manner as may be directed from the Board of
Land and Works in general instructions to be drawn up by them
for that purpose, and the person who is successful in the drawing
of such lots shall be declared the selector.” The clauses relating to


selection before survey were struck out by a majority of five. Mr.
Gray asserted that they were lost through the weakness, vacilla-
tion, and insincerity of the Ministry, and the Attorney-General in
particular.
On the Bill being reported, several clauses were re-committed,
including clause 14 :—“ The Board of Land and works shall from
time to time, cause country lands to be surveyed in allotments of
not less than 80 nor more than 320 acres and Mr. Heales moved
that the words 320 be omitted and 640 inserted in lieu therof.
On a division this amendment was carried, by 25 to 20 votes
Other amendments consequential to this were then made. Mr. James
Stewart Johnson (St. Kilda) moved an amendment in clause 42, to
the effect that a selector should, to escape the penalty of ss. per acre,
be only required to spend in improvements, pounds sterling
“ equal to one half the number of acres ” comprised in his purchased
land, instead of pounds sterling equal to “twice the number of
acres ” comprising the purchased portion. This amendment was
supported by Mr. Service, much to the surprise and alarm of the
Convention party. Mr. Gray charged the Government with another
breach of faith, contending that the improvements to the amount
of £2 per acre should be compulsory as a guarantee of bona fide
selection. Mr. Don predicted that if the Bill were kept before
the Committee much longer, it would be shaped to meet the wishes
of the ultra-squatters of Victoria. He warned the Government
that, though it might obtain a majority, then its success would be
short lived. So much stress did he lay on this clause that he
thought if it were emasculated as proposed, the Bill might as well
be given up. Mr. Gray further pointed out that the clause was
intended to guard against the encroachment and rapacity of capi-
talists. As it stood, a man taking up 2000 acres would have to
expend £4OOO in improvements, and his operations were checked
accordingly, but the amendment proposed to reduce the amount
to be expended in improvements to £lOOO. The amendment was,
however, agreed to without a division.
On the third reading a warm debate took place, the most remark-
able feature of which was that the Attorney-General (Mr. J.
Denistoun Wood) spoke against the bill, intimating that he did not
concur in its main principles, and that he would only vote for it
“ because it would have the effect of putting an end to the occu-
pation of a frothy and empty-headed race of demagogues, and the
people would find that they had been deceived.” Mr. Gray warmly
took the Attorney-General to task for his duplicity, reminding him
that his cynical remarks against liberal land legislation that
evening were fully answered by his own manifesto to the electors
of the Ovens, through whose favor he held his seat. The third
reading was carried by a majority of 44.


The Land Bill was presented to the Council on 2nd May, 1860,
by a deputation from the Assembly, consisting of Messrs. Service,
McCulloch, Heales, Bailey, Caldwell, Sergeant. Mr. Fellows took
charge of the Bill in the Council, and moved its second reading
on 18th May. Messrs. Bennett, Hervey, Mitchell, A. Fraser,
Power and Black were the principal opponents. The grounds of
objections were, that the Bill tendered to create feelings of ani-
mosity between different classes ; that it gave undue importance
to a particular interest; that it fixed a uniform price of £1 per acre,
and abolished the system of sale of land by open competition,
which was the best and fairest; that it provided for deferred pay-
ments which could never be enforced, because persons when they
once occupied lands on lease could never be dispossessed for non-
payment of rent; that in the matter of commonages, too much
power of an absolutely despotic character was given to the execu-
tive ; that the power to proclaim farmers’ commons might be
exercised to ruin the squatting interests; that the Bill was not
calculated to facilitate agricultural settlement, because a man could
not borrow money on the security of his land for the purpose of
cultivation. The second reading was carried without a division, on
the understanding that numerous amendments would be discussed
in committee.
Clause 13 was what was known as the selection clause, and was
considered the essence of the Bill. It enacted that all country
lands should be sold by selection at the uniform price of £1 per
acre. In committee, on 29th May, the first amendment moved
was by Mr. Bennett to the effect that all the words in the clause
after “ sold ”be struck out, with a view to the insertion of the
words “as hereinafter provided for.” This amendmemt was carried
by 16 to 11 votes. Mr. Strachan then moved the elision of the
provisions in clause 14, that each allotment should be divided into
four sub-divisions, which was also carried by a majority of 7. The
first of these amendments was directed against selection at <£l
per acre, and the second against the leasing of unpurchased sub-
divisions.
Next day the Ministry tendered their resignations to the
Governor. After the rejection of two important provisions of their
Land Bill, they thought it would be a waste of time to proceed
further with it, and they consequently resolved to retire and throw
the responsibility of the situation on Mr. Bennett and his friends
in the Council who had brought about the crisis. In the Council
the resignation of the Ministry was severely condemned by Mr.
Bennett and others who voted for the amendments. They were
charged with unjustifiably deserting their post, and thereby attempt-
ing to coerce the House and prevent it exercising its undoubted
functions.


The Convention party in the Assembly were extremely jubilant
and enthusiastically supported the Ministry in the bold and deter-
mined stand assumed, and they were urged not to surrender one
jot or tittle of the Bill. Lukewarm friends and determined foes
of the Bill, however, censured the Government for having prema-
turely brought both Houses into collision, and ridiculed the pos-
sibility of passing “the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill.” The
Chief Secretary, however, sprang into an unwonted popularity in
the country, and his position was rendered all the more secure, and
his sincerity more readily believed in, from the fact that it was
known that a disagreement had taken place between himself and
his Attorney-General respecting the proper course to be adopted.
It was well-known that Mr. Wood was not a friend of land reform,
and his advice and conduct were regarded with suspicion. Both
Houses adjourned for a week.
In the interval, Sir Henry Barkley > who had not accepted Mr,
Nicholson’s resignation, had interviews with several leading public
men,, and discussed the probabilities of forming a new Ministry
and of the Council passing the Land Bill. He looked upon the
suggestion that Mr. Bennett should be asked to form an adminis-
tration as tantamount to an abandonment of the old Bill which
the Assembly had spent so much time in discussing, and passed
by a large majority. Furthermore, he arrived at the conclusion,
that in the face of that majority, it would be impossible that any
administration which Mr. Bennett might form could carry on the
business of the country. The result of his enquiries led him to
believe that there was a disposition on the part of several of those
who voted against the Bill in the Council, to submit to such modi-
lications of their amendments as would make it acceptable to the
Assembly. “ Under these circumstances,” said his Excellency, in
a memorandum addressed to Mr. Nicholson, “I trust that on
viewing the Avhole position of affairs, and seeing the loss of time,
exasperation of feeling, and the serious injury in many ways to the
community which must ensue from any attempt at a change
of Ministry at the present juncture, you will consent once more
to resume charge of the Land Bill, so as to afford an opportunity
of learning what the views of the Legislative Council really are, by
how many members they are shared, and in what shape the measure
will l>e finally suffered to leave that House.”
Mr. Nicholson complied with the request of the Governor, and
withdrew his resignation, and thus a crisis was averted by tire
friendly intervention of the representative of the Crown. The popular
party was exasperated beyond measure. When the announcement
of the withdrawal of the resignation was made in the Assembly, Mr.
Duffy, Mr. Gray, Mr. Barton, Mr. J. Yv T oods, and Mr. Don charged
the Chief Secretary with having compromised the House and


betrayed the country by bis want of firmness and bis change of
front, Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Service denied that the Government
bad made any compromise, and declared that they would not give
up one of the main principles of their measure —uniform price,
leasing, and commonage. They believed that the Council would
yield those parts of the Bill, and hinted at a conference as the con-
stitutional method of arriving at a decision on disputed points.
A motion for the adjournment of the House was negatived, but the
Chief Secretary sustained a loss of prestige by this sudden
change of tactics, which he never recovered, and from that time
his administration, which lived on the toleration of the reform
party, was doomed.
The Council then resumed consideration of the Land Bill in
committee. Amendments were carried to the following effect: —
1. That the allotments to be selected should be divided into two equal
portions instead of four. 2. That the Government should cause to
be surveyed within 12 months 1,000,000 acres only, instead of
4,000,000 acres. 3. That unsold lands within one mile of land
already alienated should be declared special lands instead of half a
mile. 4. That in case more than one application for an allotment
or sub-division were sent in, the same should be sold by auction,
at which auction the applicants for such allotment or sub-divisicn,
and no other, should be allowed to bid—the land to go to the
highest bidder. 5. That the purchaser of part of an allotment
should be entitled to a grazing license for the remaining sub-divi-
sion for a period of three years, at the rate of one farthing per
acre __ su bstituted for the Agricultural leasing clauses. 6, That
improvements at a rate of £1 per acre of purchased land should
not be compulsory. 7. That the land held on license should be
used only for pastoral purposes. 8. Penalties for selling or moi t-
gaging purchased country lands within one year after purchase
were struck out. The tax of ss. per acre on unimproved lands was
also struck out. 9. The farmers’ common clauses were struck out.
10. On the motion of Mr. Fellows, new clauses were inserted,
stating that nothing was to prevent the issue of “ licenses to
depasture on Crown Lands in the manner heretofore used, but such
licenses shall, until it is otherwise provided by Parliament, continue
to be issued in the same manner and form as if this Act had not
been passed; ” that when any substantial building or other im-
provement had been constructed, or any land occupied under
license, and such Crown Lands were sold, a valuation should be
placed on the building or improvement in favor of the licensed occu-
piers. Other material amendments, about-200 in all, were made
re-modelling the measure, so that its original form could hardly be
identified. The Bill was read a third time and returned to the
Assembly on 28th June.


Whilst the Council was amending the bill, the question was
raised as to whether they were constitutionally entitled to do so,
inasmuch as it was contended the Land Bill imposed “ a rent, rate,
tax, or duty,” and thus came within the limitation of section 56 of
the Constitution Act. Mr. Nicholson asked the Attorney-General
to advise the Cabinet on the point, and Mr. Wood gave an opinion,
one of the most extraordinary, perhaps, ever given by a law-officer,
in Victoria, to the effect that the Council could not oidy amend
the Land Bill but could amend the Appropriation Bill (a). In
other words, Mr. Wood considered that the Council were only pre-
vented from amending a bill, which both imposed a tax, and ap-
propriated that tax to a specitic purpose. For the redeeming
honor and credit of the Nicholson Ministry, it is but fair to state
that this monstrous doctrine was not sanctioned by the Solicitor-
General, Mr. James F. Martley, one of the ablest lawyers who
ever graced the bar of this country. Mr. Martley whilst enter-
taining the belief that the Council could amend the Land Bill,
because it was not a bill whose primary and specific object was
“ for imposing a rent, rate, tax or impost,” merely incidentally
doing so, did not think that a bill in order to come within section
56, should both appropriate, reserve and impose taxes ; he based
his .opinions on the distinction between bills “for appropriating”
and “ for imposing,” and “ bills appropriating ” and “ bills im-
posing.” A money bill, he argued, was for appropriating revenue,
or for imposing a tax ; whilst the Land Bill did neither of these
things ; the rent and price reserved by that bill was an equivalent
for land demised from the Crown, and was not a rent within the
meaning of the section.
On the motion that the amendments of the Council be taken
into consideration, a stormy debate took place. Special objection
was taken by Mr. Gray to the new clauses introduced, which, he
said, were intended to perpetuate the squatters’ titles. The hon.
member bitterly accused the Attorney-General of treachery ; he
asserted that those clauses had been introduced in the Council at
the instigation of the chief law officer of the Ministry. An amend-
ment moved by Mr. Duffy, that the House disagree with the
amendments of the Council, was negatived by a majority of 14.
The House rejected the Council’s amendments substituting
limited auction for the lot system; rejected the sub-division
of allotments into two parts ; rejected the Council’s amend-
ment omitting Is. 6d. for every acre leased in a sub-division, and
substituting one farthing per acre for three years, and in lieu
thereof inserted one shilling per acre, and restored the pre-emptive
right of purchasing at the end of seven years, consenting to the
leased land being used for pastoral purposes only ; disagreed with
f. A ) Hansard, vol. 0, p. 1441.


the Council in striking out the compulsory improvement clauses;
adopted the compensation for improvement clause ; rejected the
clause relating to the issue of licenses as heretofore. Several of
the Council’s amendments altering the machinery of the bill were
accepted, and the bill was returned to that chamber.
The Council decided to insist upon its principal amendments
and the bill was again returned to the Assembly. These negotia-
tions terminated in a conference between the two Houses, at which
a compromise was arrived at. The result was that on 18th Septem-
ber, 1860 the amended and severely mutilated bill became law.
Some of the details of this prolonged struggle have been given
in order to show the difficulties which the Land Reformers of
1860 had to contend with, and to explain how far the Land Legis-
lation of that period failed to come up to the programme of the
party. The Act was an affair of shreds and patches, almost com-
pletely destitute of sound principle, and it proved a most deplor-
able failure accordingly. There were few traces of identity be-
tween the bill as originally introduced, and the Act which became
law.


CHAPTER IY.
THE OCCUPATION LICENSES, AND THE DUFFY LAND ACT.
The Nicholson Administration having carried their Land Bill,
Parliament was, on 18th September, prorogued till 20th November,
when the necessity of providing for the exigencies of the public
service compelled them again to meet the Assembly. Their career
was doomed to be cut short. The Administration had, at no stage
of its existence, been a strong one. Its history was one unceasing
■struggle. Its poverty of definite principle left it with few warm
friends, and many vigorous foes. The Land Reformers were offended
with the Chief Secretary and the Attorney General, on account of
the pusillaninity and want of earnestness of one and the unmiti-
gated treachery of the other. At that time the Convention Party
held the balance of power in the House. Having no faith in Mr.
Nicholson and his colleagues they determined to join the straight
opposition, led by Mr. O’Shanassy, in order to expel the Ministry
from office. Accordingly an amendment was moved to the address
in reply to the Governor’s speech. Mr. J. H. Brooke, member for
East Geelong, and a prominent Land Reformer, was entrusted
with the amendment. The grounds of attack were that the Minis-
try had not declared their policy on the question of the occupation
of Crown lands for pastoral purposes; that they had unsatis-
factorily administered the Land Act; that no intimation had been
given respecting the necessary re-adjustment of the financial sys-
tem of the colony, and generally that the Government did not pos-
sess the confidence of the country. Mr. O’Shanassy seconded the
motion, which was carried by a majority of 13.
The Ministry resigned, and Sir Henry Barkly then invited
Mr O’Shanassy, as head of the previous administration, and Mr.
Elden, as leading seceder from the Ministerial ranks, to form a
Government. These gentlemen declined to undertake the task.
Mr. Brooke was then entrusted with the important duty. Knowing
that he merely occupied the position of nominal leader of the ma-
jority, he convened a caucus of the opposition, at which the members
of the incoming Ministry were nominated and elected by ballot.


Mr. Brooke then met the gentlemen so elected, and arranged the
distribution of port-folios. He was not allowed to grasp the coveted
prize of the Chief Secretaryship. Mr. J. S. Johnson, of St. Kilda,
was offered it, hut had not the courage to accept it. Mr. Richard
Heales became Chief Secretary, and the other offices were distri-
buted thus Mr. Brooke, Minister of Lands; Mr. Ireland, Attorney-
General ; Mr. Verdon, Treasurer ; Mr. Johnson, Commissioner of
Public Works; Mr. B. S. Anderson, Commissioner of Land and
Customs ; Mr. Thomas Loader, Commissioner of Railways; Mr. J.
B. Humphray, Minister of Mines. Thus came into existence the
celebrated Heales’ Ministry—a Ministry intended by the squatting
party to be a kind of ad interim arrangement to prepare the way
for a true-blue Conservative Government. Instead of occupying
that despicable position it became one of the most popular
Ministries that ever ruled Victoria. It laid the foundation of
Liberal Land Legislation, and left an honorable and enduring
reputation.
The name of Mr. Richard Heales is still a house-hold word in
Victoria. It is still respected ’by thousands who in years past
were guided by his example and encouraged by his manly exhorta-
tions. He was a temperance advocate, a social reformer, and a
man of the people. He arrived in the colony in 1842, a coach-
maker by trade. The story of his adventures and privations;
his gradual progress from 6s. per day, the wages of a day labourer,
to the post of Chief Secretary of “the People’s Ministry ” is one of
the most extraordinary in the annals of Australian biography. He
entered the Assembly as member for East Bourke in 1857, when
Mr. O’Shanassy first appealed to the Constituencies on behalf of
his ministers. On that occasion he defeated Dr. Greeves, Com-
missioner of Customs of Mr. O’Shanassy’s Government. In Sep-
tember 1859, Mr. Heales was returned for East Bourke Borough
and on the 26th. November, 1860, he became Chief Secretary of Vic-
toria. During his Parliamentary career he had always sided with the
cause of the masses, and took great interest in the Land question.
Not having been in office prior to his advent to the Chief Secretary-
ship, he was not familiar with political red-tapeism; yet in' his
official life as leader of the House and head of the Cabinet he dis-
played an amount of tact and plodding ability that delighted his
friends, and disappointed his foes. Having marked out and
adopted a Liberal policy, he proceeded to give effect to it; nor was
he unsuccessful ; although harrassed on all sides by implacable and
powerful enemies.
The new Ministry was not long installed in office before the
defects of the Nicholson Land Act, and its utter inability to meet
the requirements of the country with regard to the settlement of
the people on the soil, became glaringly apparent to them. It was


found that the eliminations effected by the squatters and large
landed proprietors in the Upper House, assisted by a powerful
minority in the Assembly, had left the measure a shameful abor-
tion. Fine Agricultural lands were thrown open for selection
in order that persons who desired to become farmers and raisers
of produce might have every opportunity of doing so if they could
according to law ; but most of the land so offered passed to the
squatters. Land unfit for cultivation remained uncalled for (a).
The so-called system of “ limited auction ” proved a disastrous
blunder. The squatters competed for almost every valuable allot-
ments put into the market, and drove out the small cultivators.
A return prepared by an officer of the lands department showed
how the land went into large estates.
At a place called Muntham, County Dundas—l3,3Bß acres were
proclaimed, and it was supposed that the pastoral tenant, Mr. Henty,
had obtained 11,146 acres. At North Wilgul, County Grenville,
about 11,000 acres were proclaimed, the whole of which was sup-
posed to have become the property of Messrs. Rowe, Me Yean and
Faris, pastoral tenants. At South Wilgul, Grenville, about
6,500 acres were proclaimed, the whole, excepting about 300 acres,
supposed to have fallen into the hands of of the pastoral tenants,
Messrs. Elder and M‘Yean. At Warracborunah, Grenville, about
14,000 acres were proclaimed, the whole supposed to have fallen
into the hands of the pastoral tenant, Mr. Timms. At Gala,
Hampden, 38,000 acres were proclaimed, of which about 25,000
acres were supposed to have become the property of the pastoral ten
ants, Messrs. Anderson, Wilson and Mack. At Mannibadar, Gren-
ville, 16,000 acres were proclaimed, nearly the whole of which had,
it is supposed, become the property of the pastoral tenants, Messrs.
Baird, Rowe, Mack and Clark. At Turkeeth, Grenville, 19,000
acres were proclaimed, nearly the whole of which was apparently
taken up on behalf of the pastoral tenants, Messrs. Armytage,
Beale, Calvert and Dennis Brothers. At North Poliah, Grenville,
11,700 acres were proclaimed ; 6,000 acres were supposed to have
fallen into the hands of the pastoral tenants, Messrs. Mack, Rowe
and M‘Yean. At Cressy and Yarima, Grenville, about 24,000
acres were proclaimed, of which 13,500 had been taken up—the
greater portion by and on behalf of the pastoral tenants, Messrs,
Bell, Elder and Russell. At Ondit, Grenville, about 16,500 acres
were proclaimed, of which about 13,000 acres appeared to have fallen
into the hands of the pastortal tenants, Messr. Bell and Calvert.
A poor man could not buy a farm in any part of the Agricul-
tural districts without having to run the gauntlet of competition
at auction against, perhaps, the richest man in the place, whose
interest in a neighbouring run gave him a strong inducement to bid

high in Order to keep off introducing selectors. The cost of coun-
try land was frequently as high as £5, £6 and £7 per acre ; the
average cost being £1 19s. 4d. per acre. In this way there was
little difference between the mode of alienating country lands, and
that of alienating special lands. Free selection at an uniform price
had no existance in law or in fact. A difficulty equally as serious
as that which stopped agricutural settlement also arose on and
in the vicinity of gold-fields. Thousands of miners and other per-
sons being unable to buy freeholds at auction built and settled
upon crown land without having a scrap of title, they planted
vineyards and orchards, cultivated little plots of ground, and there-
on established their hearths and homes. Their occupation was
utterly illegal and in defiance of the executive authority. But
what could be done 1 Were these unfortunate people to be turned
out of their houses and gardens into the wilderness simply because
an unrighteous legislature had neglected, or refused to provide for
their simple wants 1
It was under these circumstances—seeing that the intention of
the Land Act to settle the people on the soil, at the uniform price
of £1 per acre had been defeated, and that a large class of the
population were compelled to occupy Crown Lands in defiance of
the law, owing to the default of the law—that Mr. Heales and his
Minister of Lands, Mr. Brooks, guided by the advice of the
Attorney-General, Mr. Ireland, adopted the expedient now famous
in the history of Victorian Land Legislation, known as the “ occu-
pation licenses.” By section 68 of the Nicholson Land Act, the
Board of Land and Works was authorised to grant licenses for
terms not exceeding seven years, to persons to occupy Crown Lands
for the sites of inns, stores, bridges, or ferries, etc., “or for such
other purposes as may appear to the said board to be for the public
advantage or convenience,” On carefully considering this section,
Ministers arrived at the conclusion that its general power might
be made use of for promoting bona fide selection. The whole
question was one of legal interpretation. What was the meaning
of the words “ or for such other purposes as may appear to the said
board to be for the public advantage or convenience 1” Would
those words include a license to a miner to occupy a residence
area 'I Would they enable the Minister to grant a license to a
farmer to cultivate 1 ? “I think that the true interpretation of the
section,” said the Attorney-General (a), “will appear if it is observed
that the common point of agreement among the different classes
enumerated is that they each imply an enterprise which is under-
taken primarily indeed for the private benefit, but which tends to pro-
duce some public advantage or convenience.” In his opinion the
clause was applicable to any species of industry which was pri-
(a) Mr. Ireland’s opinion. Hansard, vol. 8, p. 78.


manly for the benefit of the individual, but ultimately for the benefit
of the community at large.
On the strength of this section, with its convenient interpreta-
tion, the Ministry resolved to issue licenses legalizing the goldfield
holdings referred to, as well as to enable persons to select small
farms. On the 23rd May, 1861, a proclamation was published in
the Gazette to the following effect
“ Fees for the occupation of Crown Lands for other than
Pastoral Purposes. —ln accordance with the provisions of the
Act, 24 Victoria, No. 117, the Board of Land and Works has
directed the fees hereinafter mentioned to be charged for the occu-
pation of crown lands for other than pastoral purposes, subject to
the conditions hereinafter prescribed.” Then followed the schedule
of purposes with rent, including among others :—“ For residence
and cultivating on the Gold-fields—£lo per annum payable
quarterly, in advance, authorising the holder to occupy and cultivate
two acres of land in such position as may be approved by the Board
of Land and Works, and to erect a residence on such land, together
with an additional fee computed at the rate of ss. per acre per
annum for every additional acre enclosed by the holder of the
license subject to the conditions, that the total number of acres so
occupied shall not exceed 20 acres. Conditions.—The Government
may, at any time, survey and alienate by way of auction or other-
wise, any of the lots so occupied, subject to the conditions of a
valuation for improvements. The Crown reserves the right to
survey and dedicate to public use such roads as may be deemed
essential for public convenience, through any of the allotments so
held without payment for any improvements that may be found on
such roads when so set out. The Government shall have full powers
to withhold the issue of, or revoke any, of the licenses aforesaid
Avhen deemed expedient to do so.”
This announcement did not attract much attention in the
Assembly when it was first made. Little importance was perhaps
attached to it by the opposition, as a formidable and determined
effort was on the point of being made to drive the Ministry from
the treasury benches. On Friday, 13th June, Mr. Hedley, member
for Gipps Land, was put forward to move a long threatened vote
of want of confidence. It was supported by Mr. O’Shanassy,
Mr. Duffy and other leading members who had helped to place
Mr. Heales in office. Mr. Higinbotham, then a new member,
disapproved of the trick by which it was proposed to effect a
change of Ministry, though he was by no means an ardent sup-
porter of theirs. Mr, Heales manfully defended his Government,
but the traitors and apostates in his camp were too many for him.
The motion was carried by a majority of 18, at a sitting which
commenced at half past four on Friday afternoon and lasted till 13
minutes past one o’clock p.m, on Saturday,


On the following Tuesday the House was startled by an announce-
ment that Ministers had obtained a dissolution, which would take
place as soon as the Appropriation Bill was passed. The majority
who had voted against the Government adopted an address to Sir
Henry Barkly protesting against the proposed dissolution, and
asking that Parliament should be called together as early as possible
after the general elections. Hot content with this, they inserted,
on the motion of Mr. Nicholson, an unprecedented clause in
the Appropriation Act, providing that no money appropriated
by the Act, should be available for payment after 31st August,
unless Parliament was then sitting. These outrageous proceedings
elicited a dignified rebuke from the representative of the Crown,
and excited strong .expressions of indignation throughout the
country.
Mr. Heales appealed to the country mainly on the land question;
his policy was free selection before survey, uniform price, and
periodic payments. The issue of occupation licenses was the main
administrative act for which he claimed approval. The regula-
tions of 23rd May were amended and improved by others proclaimed
on 28th August. It was announced that residence and cultivation
licenses would be issued to occupy country lands not situated
within seven and a-half miles from existing gold-workings and not
proclaimed for selection. The limit of area for which a license
could issue was not less than 40 acres and not more than 160
acres. The licenses were not to be transferable without permission
of the Board of Land and Works. No person under the age of 21
years could obtain a license. The licenses were to be from year to
year for a period not exceeding seven years. Licensed land could
be alienated by auction at any time, subject to a valuation for
buildings, fencing, and improvements, but the government under-
took not to sell such land during the currency of the license, unless,
on the applications of or with the consent of the licensee. If a
number of appplications were received simultaneously for the same
piece of land, the name of the successful applicant was to be deter-
mined by lot. The fees for residence and cultivation licenses of
country lands were fixed at the rate of 2s. 6d. per acre per annum,
payable in advance. Licenses were to be forfeited (1), if the land
described in the license was taken in collusion with any person other
than the person named in the license. (2). If more than one allot-
ment were occupied, or more than one license obtained by the same
person. (3). If land for which a license was granted were sub-let.
(4). Non-residence upon the land or neglecting to make improve-
ments thereon, within a reasonable period after issue of the license to
occupy same, precluded renewal of any residence or cultivation,
license. Licenses could be issued to occupy land before as well as
after survey. The system of land settlement promulgated by these


regulations was a startling revolution compared with the obstruc-
tive policy that had so long predominated in the colony. Now
it could be said, with truth, that the lands had at last been un-
locked ; the poor and struggling classes were no longer shut out
from enjoyment of the inheritance bequeathed to them by the
British Parliament.
The result of the appeal to the constituencies was an overwhelm-
ing verdict in favor of the Ministry and their land policy. The large
majority of members returned were pledged to support the occupa-
tion licenses, and the Government which introduced them.
Ministers met parliament triumphantly. The speech placed in the
hands of the Governor stated that the demand for occupation and
cultivation licenses was so great as amply to vindicate the necessity
and expediency of their issue. Such was the general satisfaction
evinced by miners and others desirous of providing homes for them-
selves and their families, but who had been hitherto practically
denied the opportunity of substantial settlement, that it was deemed
desirable to extend the advantages of the system to persons who
wished to engage in agricultural pursuits, under regulations framed
to prevent speculation, and undue competition, and to promote the
occupation of the lands by those who actually cultivated and
resided on them. “I trust,” said his Excellency, “that this, the
most liberal land system in the Australian colonies, —will not only be
duly appreciated and extensively resorted to by our own popula-
tion, and that the exodus of those unsettled portions of the people
who, having no fixed attachment to the country, are led away by
every rumour of a newly-discovered gold-field, will be checked, but
that it will be a powerful inducement to intending emigrants to
make this favoured land their home, who might otherwise have
directed their course elsewhere. It is not too much to hope that
the prosperity of the country, retarded by the want of facilities for
settling on the soil, will rapidly advance under the operation of the
new system.”
The new system, however, was destined to undergo many assaults.
No sooner had the Assembly met for business (12th September),
then Mr. Duffy moved a vote of censure against the Government for
undertaking to issue the occupation licenses announced in the
Gazette of 28th August. In this movement, Mr. Duffy was sup-
ported by Mr. O’Shanassy, Mr. Haines, and the land monopolist
party, with which Mr. Duffy, at this time, began to identify himself
and his political fortunes. Hitherto he had co-operated or pre-
tended to co-operate with the Convention party, and, in fact, acted
as one of their leaders in the House. By degrees, however,
he parted company with the land reformers and threw himself
into the arms of the squatters. He was now selected to attack
the occupation licenses. The grounds of attack were; 1. That


the regulations should have been approved by the Governor-in-
Council, whereas they had been promulgated on the sole authority
of the Board of Land and Works. 2. That the Land Act in no
way authorised or contemplated the exercise by a Minister of such
tremendous power as that assumed by the regulations. 3. That
the words of the 68th section “ for the public advantage or conve-
nience,” did not mean general purposes, but purposes of the same
kind and character as those comprehended by the preceding words
of the section—such as “inns, stores, bridges, or ferries.” 4. That
if those words would authorise the granting of licenses for cultiva-
tion and residence they would also legalise the granting of pas-
toral licenses. 5. That the Government had been guilty of a gross
contempt of Parliament in attempting to effect such a serious change
in our land system on the eve of its assembling without seeking
its sanction. The Government defended their action on legal and
political grounds. The country, they said, had approved of their
policy, and as regards the legal aspect of the question they had
acted on the opinion of their Attorney-General. In the meantim e
however, Mr. Ireland had resigned the Attorney-Generalship, and
had been succeeded by Mr. B. 0. Aspinall, The late Attorney-
General defended the legality of the licenses, but considered that
the Government ought to have consulted Parliament before adopt-
ing them. Mr. Aspinall very ably vindicated the policy of the
Government. Mr. Heales described the licenses as “ the fulcrum
for settling the people on the lands,” and he solemnly warned the
House not to surrender the advantage which it had gained over the
other chamber. Mr. Graham Berry, just returned as a colleague
of Mi\ Charles Jardine Don in the representation of CollingAvood,
distinguished himself in this debate. He deeply regretted the
secession of Mr. Duffy from the ranks of the land reformers.
Attributing his hostile action to the desire for office, Mr. Berry re-
minded the member for Yilliers and Heytesbury that he ought to
have been contented to have done as Mr. Wilson Gray, the member
for Rodney, had cheerfully done—content to fight in the ranks,
allowing men to occupy the Treasury Benches who had no stronger
claims than himself, but who had been placed there by the force
of circumstances. “The hon. member,” said Mr. Berry, “knew
well the power of the immense monopoly against which they were
struggling, and, therefore, it would have been more to his honour
if he had joined hon. members on his (Mr. Berry’s) side of the
House’ (a). “Through the great power and influence of this
party,” continued the member for Collingwood, “the House was
legislating, not as it would, but as it could after every other resource
had been exhausted, after the country had been brought to its
present state after the popular party had been brought weaker
(A) Hansard vol, 8, p, 145.


and weaker every day, while the party against which they were
fighting was increasing in strength and in magnitude every day.”
“Victoria had now an unworkable constitution. The constitution
had given them an Upper House, which would do nothing itself,
and would prevent the Assembly from doing anything —an Upper
House, composed of men determined to hold the land at all hazards
against the people of this country.” The division took place at 20
minutes to 5 o’clock on the morning of Saturday, 20th September.
The resolution and several amendments to it were negatived by
large majorities in favour of the ministers.
The enemies of the ministry, open and secret, perceived that the
occupation licenses were too popular with the country to be trifled
with, but they were determined to oust, by fair means or foul, the
men whose administration of the public lands would be so fatal to
the aggregation and maintenance of large estates. The financial
scheme of the Government had scarcely been placed before the
House by Mr. Verdon, when another raid on the Treasury benches
was commenced. On the order of the day for going into commit-
tee of Ways and Means, Mr. O’Shanassy moved.—“ That this House
having maturely considered the estimate of income for 1862 sub-
mitted by the Government, is of opinion that it is unreliable and
unsatisfactory. It is further of opinion that the inconsistent
policy upon which such estimate is founded, gives no assurance of
raising the country from its present depressed condition, and this
House, therefore, declines to enter upon its consideration.” Mr.
Nicholson seconded the motion. The Victorian Association formed
for the purpose of buying the votes of members in the interest of
the squatters were victorious, Messrs. O’Shanassy and Nicholson
found a pliant majority at their command. The Ministry were
defeated by needy schemers, notorious renegades, apostates and
traitors, who, for place, pay, power and patronage, sold themselves
and their constituents, and brought into contempt the represent-
ative institutions of the country. “ Never,” said the Chief Sec-
retary on the eve of defeat, “ never in the history of responsible
government had liberal and political principles received such a blow
as by the change of the hon. members who were elected to support
the Ministerial programme, but who had distorted the professions
of the Government, and lived on the hope that some little thing
would turn up to enable them to solve their consciences, and show
their supporters that they had a plausibility to justify their change;
in that respect the country had been deceived, and those hon,
members had inflicted a great blow upon responsible government.
It was for the Government to take the verdict of the House, and
leave the country to decide.” The resolution was carried by 40
votes to 34, and next day 12th November, Mr. Heales resigned
office.


Mr. O’Shanassy then formed his third and last Cabinet, the
offices being distributed as follows :—Mr. O’Shanassy, Chief Sec-
retary ; Mr. Haines, Treasurer ; Mr. Duffy, Commissioner of Lands;
Mr. Ireland, Attorney-General; Mr. J. D. Wood, Minister of
Justice ; Mr. Johnson, Commissioner of Works; Mr. Anderson,
Commissioner of Customs ; Mr. Nicholson seat in the Cabinet with-
out office.
Meanwhile the question of the legality or otherwise of the
occupation licenses, was decided by the Supreme Court in the
case of Fenton v Skinner, (sth December), The Court held
that the words in the 68th section of the Land Act, “ such other
purposes as may appear to the said Board to be for the public
advantage or convenience,” meant purposes ejusdem generis (of
the same kind) with those enumerated in the same section, and
that a license for “ residence and cultivation ” was not ejusdem
generis , and was therefore void. The entire fabric of the land
system constnicted by the Heales Government thus tumbled in
ruins, by the defeat of the Ministry and the decision of the Su-
preme Court, Not only did Mr. O’Shanassy and his collegues sus-
pend the operations of the regulations, but, actions for trespass
were commenced by pastoral tenants in all directions against un-
fortunate holders of licenses who resided on and cultivated parts
of runs. The new Government, however, did what they could to
discourage these actions, and resolved to protect the occupation
licenses by special conditions, to be inserted in the pastoral licenses
of the following year.
Several useful purposes at any rate were served by the oc-
cupation licenses. They alarmed the Upper House ; they induced
the squatting party to negotiate for a new land bill on a more
liberal basis ; they supplied the precedent and model of future
land bills ; they recognised the principle of leasing Crown Lands in
small allotments, subject to an annual rent; they suggested the
stringent conditions under which agricultural settlement should be
enforced, and they placed many hundreds of families upon the
soil (a).
On the 28th January, 1862, Mr. Duffy introduced a land bill,
having for its avowed objects the amendment of the defects' of the
Nicholson Act, and the adjustment of the terms of pastoral occu-
pation. The bill dealt with the entire territory—pastoral as well
as agricultural lands. At this time about 4,500,000 acres of the
public estate had been sold ; about 1,500,000 acres were reserved
for commonage ; about 500,000 acres were occupied and worked as
gold-fields, making altogether nearly 7,000,000 acres occupied in a
useful and productive manner by the great masses of the popu_
lation. There were 35,000,000 acres occupied for pastoral pur^

poses, yielding an annual revenue of £250,000, whilst 13,000,000
acres were unoccupied, and produced no revenue whatever. Of
the 35,000,000 acres of pastoral country 10,000,000 acres were
considered to be of pre-eminent value for agricultural purposes.
By the Duffy Land Bill it was proposed to reserve these 10,000,000
acres for proclamation in agricultural areas, and not less than
4,000,000 acres were to be surveyed and open for selection, within
three months of the passing of the Bill. The agricultural areas
were to be surveyed in allotments of not more than 640 acres, and
not less than 40 acres each. Persons wishing to select an allotment
were required to “ make a written application ” to the nearest land
office. The next principal feature of the scheme was that of the
system of sale by auction was abolished, and if more than one
application for the same lot were received by the land officers on
the same day, during office hours, the officer determined by lot
which of the applicants was entitled to priority. A selector could
pay the purchase money, £1 per acre, for the whole allotment, or
could pay the purchase money of half and lease the balance for
eight years at a rent of 2s. 6d. per acre, payable in advance. The
rent went towards the purchase money of the leased land. At any
time during the term of the lease the purchaser of the first moiety,
his heirs or assigns, was entitled to a grant of the leased moiety as
real estate, on payment of the difference between the amount of
rent actually paid, and the entire sum of £1 per acre. “ The occu-
pation license,” said Mr. Duffy, made the licensee liable for a rent
of 2s. 6d. per acre while he was in possession, but that rent was not
reckoned as part of his purchase money for the land. Is ow, the
Government proposed that every 2s. 6d. paid in the shape of rent
should be regarded as an eighth of the price of the land (a).
The conditions attached to selection were :—l. No infant or mar-
ried woman living with her husband could select. 2. No person
could select more than one allotment of 640 acres within a period
of twelve months. 3. Every selector was bound (a) to cultivate
one acre of every ten selected within a year after selection, oi (5)
erect a habitable dwelling thereon, or (c) enclose such allotment
with a substantial fence. 4. If any land within an agricultural
area remained unselected after the expiration of one yeai from
its proclamation it could be sold by public auction. 5. The Bill
required an intending applicant to make a declaration on oath,
_ . -■ a *1 • 1 *1 TO 1 _J. a. a. n 4- /-v« 4 m loIaA T AY»
that he applied on his own behalf and not as agent or trustee for
any other person, a false declaration rendering him liable to prose-
cution for perjury. Provision was made for protecting the rights of
holders of occupation licenses. Those who' had received licenses
for agricultural land were allowed to remain in occupation for 8
years at 2s. 6d. per acre, or they could at once come under the
(a) Hansard, vol. 8 p. 348.


operation of the Bill Every applicant for a license who received
a certificate of having applied prior to 18th November was placed
in the same position as the holder of a license. The second part of
the Bill provided for the sale of special lands by auction at an upset
price, to be fixed by the Governor-in-Council, not less than £1 per
acre. The third division of the Bill established a system of letting
public lands by lease or license for several useful purposes and enter-
prises, such as the growth of olives, vines, mulberries, hops, Arc.
The fourth part made provisions for commons and placing them in
the control of local managers. The fifth part dealt with pastoral
occupation of the country.
The precarious and doubtful nature of the pastoral tenancy has
been already described. Owing to difficulties explained, Mr.
Latrobe refused to issue 14 years leases to the squatters under the
Order in Council of March 1847. On 19th June, 1850, another
Order in Council was promulgated by the Queen in Council authoris-
ing the Governor to grant leases of waste land for periods not exceed-
ing one year for pastoral and other purposes and further authorising
the governor to sell to a leaseholder any part of the land comprised
in the lease. The squatters therefore held their runs under this
annual licensing system up to the date of the bill now under discus-
sion, for, although the Imperial Statute 9 and 10 Victoria, cap. 104,
under which the Orders in Council were framed, was repealed by
the Imperial Statute 18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 56 (the Victorian Con-
stitution Statute), the fourth section of the last named Act expressly
preserved the Orders in Council until repealed by the Victorian
Legislature and those Orders were left unrepealed by the Nicholson
Land Act. There was a general impression abroad that the squat-
ting system would terminate in 1861 or 1862. This feeling which
was very strong among the members of the Convention party may
be thus accounted for. The leases contemplated by the Order in
Council of 7th March, 1847, were not issued, but, notwithstanding
that the squatters continued in occupation as annual tenants. Had
they held the 14 years leases which they claimed, those leases
would have terminated by effluxion of time in 1861. On 28th
July, 1852, however, the Legislative Council in Victoria passed a
resolution by which it was determined that the leases should issue,
as of 7th April, 1848, so that if this was to be regarded as a pledge
given by Parliament the leases should not have been treated as
expiring before 7th April, 1862 (a).
This was the position of the pastoral question, when it was ap-
proached by the Duffy Land Bill. There were then 981 runs,
upon which assessment was paid, embracing 35,000,000 acres,
yielding a rental of about £250,000. Of these runs, 285 were
returned as carrying less than 4000 sheep ; 400 carried less than
(a) Mr. Ireland’s opinion. Hansard, vol. 7, p. G 7.


5000 sheep : and 250 carried more than 5000 and less than 10,000
sheep. The amount of stock, including horses, cattle and sheep,
depastured on the licensed Crown Lands of the Colony at this
period, showed an equivalent in sheep of 7,827,889, but there were
strong reasons for believing that this amount was far below the
grazing capabilities of the licensed land. The bill proposed to grant
licenses to occupy for pastoral purposes to persons in licensed occu-
pation of runs for that purpose at the time of the passing of the Act.
These yearly licenses were to be issued every year, for 10 years—
terminating in December, 1871. The rent to be paid was at the
rate of Is. 6d. per sheep, or 2s. for every head of cattle which a
run was capable of carrying. No license issued for a run was to
prevent any part of it from being sold, leased, or proclaimed a
common, or occupied under miners right, or license for other than
pastoral purposes. Crown land not occupied under lease or license
could be submitted to auction in pastoral runs of such extent as
the Governor in Council saw fit.
Among other general provisions of the bill was one repealing the
Orders in Council, and providing for the compensation of squatters
for improvements on parts of their runs, which might be reserved
or leased. A portion of the revenue derived from land was
appropriated for the purpose of assisted immigration.
The main objections to this scheme were raised by Messrs. Heales,
Brooke, Wilson Gray, and Berry. It was contended that the bill
was framed essentially in the interest of the squatters and wealthy
classes, and that a few liberal clauses were thrown in as a sop to
the farmers. Whilst the people expected that the squatting tenure
was to terminate in 1862, and that thereafter the whole of the
Crown Lands of the Colony would be thrown open for free pastur-
age, the Bill proposed to give to the squatters what was virtually
a perpetuity of title. If the system was to be continued the runs
should have been sub-divided and the rent determined by public
competition and not by arbitration as the measure contemplated.
Farmers were to buy small allotments whilst squatters were to rent
large sections, whereas, the two pursuits, agriculture and pasture,
should have been united ; at any rate, one class of men should not
be allowed such a great advantage over another. Another objec-
tion was that if agricultural lands were not selected within one year
after proclamation, they might be put up for sale by auction.
According to this arrangement land was only available for tree
selection during one year ; the result would be to enable squatters
to buy up whole territories. As to the provision that one person
could not select more than 640 acres in a year, that was absolutely
futile, as there was nothing to prevent the owner of one allotment
from mortgaging it to another, as was done under the Nicholson
Act. The action of Mr. Duffy was severely criticised ; he was


reminded of having denounced the Haines Bill as a swindle, because
it proposed to give the squatters annual leases for seven years ; he
was reminded that he had, on the same occasion, declared that the
squatters had no rights under the Orders in Council, yet, he now
asked the House to give 10 years licenses to the squatters with the
right of compensation for improvements. Mr. Heales declared that
this bill gave the squatters advantages which the Haines Bill never
proposed, whilst Mr. Gray asserted that Mr. Duffy’s Bill was inferior
to the Nicholson Act.
The second reading was carried by 38 to 26 votes. In com-
mittee, several amendments were made, owing to the persistency
and energy of the opposition. The clause providing for the sale by
auction of land unselected within one year after its proclamation
as part of an agricultural area was amended so as to allow pro-
claimed land to remain open for selection for three years. The
term of squatters’ licenses was reduced from 10 to 9 years—termin-
ating on 31st December, 1870. On the motion of Mr. M. J.
Cummins (member for South Grant), a new clause was carried,
giving persons who were the owners of freehold, purchased, the
right to select an allotment of Crown Lands equal in size to their
freehold lot, and not exceeding 320 acres, lease it on the same
terms and conditions as selectors under the new Act. Before so select-
ing these freeholders were required to produce a certificate from the
Crown solicitor showing their qualifications. Mr. Gray endeavoured
to carry an amendment limiting the maximum area of an allotment
to 320 acres instead of 640 acres, but it did not meet with strong
support. Mr, Gray proposed a clause to the effect that no Crown
grant should issue to any person selecting lands until twelve months
had elapsed after the date of such selection, and until such twelve
months had elapsed, it should not be lawful for such selector to sell,
convey, lease, mortgage, charge, encumber, or to agree then or at any
future time to sell, lease, mortgage, charge, encumber the same, or any
part thereof, and every attempt or agreement so to dispose of or affect
the same, should be illegal and void. The clause was negatived,
but the time came when the want of such a clause became deplor-
ably manifest. \
The bill was passed through the Assembly, and strange to relate,
received the assent of the Council without amendment, and became
law on 18th June, 1862. This circumstance of itself was extremely
suspicious. It can only be accounted for by the supposition that the
nine years licenses were baits too tempting to the squatting majority
of the Upper House, and that they had full confidence that the Act,
as it had passed the Assembly, could be worked in the interest of
their friends. With the passage of this measure two great political
organisations became defunct. The Convention party was dissolved,
Mr. Wilson Gray leaving Victoria to seek his fortunes in New


Zealand. The Victorian Association, more popularly known as the
bribing confederacy of the White Hart, adjourned sine die. Their
work was done and well done, the £30,000 spent in debauching consti-
tuencies and bribing politicians was, for the purposes of the Asso-
ciation, well invested; the gold of the squatters exercised a more
potent influence than the agitation of the Convention or the
thunders of the liberal press.
It is now necessary to see how the Land Act operated, and it
will, on examination, be seen that some of its most fatal blemishes
completely escaped the vigilance of the Liberal party in the As-
sembly. In accordance with the requirements of the Act 4,000,000
acres were thrown open for selection in agricultural areas. Then
began a land racket unparalleled in the history of Australia. The
land offices were rushed by crowds of dummies who selected the
best land on behalf of the pastoral tenants. On most of the princi-
pal stations gangs of dummies were organized and sent to the
neighbouring land offices to out-number the bona fide selectors, and
swamp them in the drawing of lots. At one office (Camperdown)
the dummies mustered in such strong force on the day proclaimed
for the reception of applications that the few bona fide applicants
present were absolutely prevented from lodging their forms during
office hours. The Act was not in force many months before it was
completely and ignominously riddled, and its brilliant framer and
adroit administrator became the subject of universal execration.
Before Parliament was again called together over 1,000,000 acres
of the best available agricultural land were mopped up by squatters.
The weak points of the Act may be shortly summarised. There
was nothing in it to render personal application for land necessary.
Consequently a squatter could send his agents and emissaries all
over the country, and put in applications, so as to be able to compete
with bona fide selectors in the drawing of lots. Indeed the bona fide
cultivator, who made personal application, was placed in a worse
position than under the limited auction system, whilst the squatter
was better off', having the chance of getting land at £1 per acre.
The squatter could put in 50 or 60 applications for one allotment
(through his dummies), and by that means the straightforward, honest
applicant had very little chance of succeeding. It subsequently trans-
pired that Mr. Duffy had acted on the opinion of the Attorney-
General in deciding that there was nothing in the Act to compel
the personal attendance of applicants. This was one of what Mr.
Higinbotham described as “numberless loop-holes through which
unprincipled persons might find the means of evading the provisions
of the Act.” A still more alarming defect was soon discovered. It
was found that by a most extraordinary oversight a word had beer,
allowed to creep into the Act which allowed dummies to transfer
their land without difficulty or delay under the sanction of law.


The fatal word was in a clause which stated that “on payment of
the last sums due on account of the rent so reserved, or at any time
during the term of payment of the difference between the amount
of rent actually paid and the entire sum of £1 per acre, the pur-
chaser of the first moiety, his heirs or assigns shall be entitled to a
grant of the remaining or leased moiety as real estate.” The word
“ assigns” in that clause enabled a dummy to take up land in his
own name and afterwards assign the lease to his principal, who could,
on paying the balance of the purchase money, get a Crown grant. In
this way unrestricted and unqualified power of assigning leases was
given. Nor Avas this the Avorse aspect of the poAver of assignment.
The Nicholson Act provided that a lease should become void if a
lessee or his assigns did not, Avithin a year of its commencement,
effect on the purchased sub-division of the allotment improvements
of the value of £1 for every acre of such pui'chased sub-division.
Under the Duffy Act the “ selector” only, and not the “ assign,” was
bound to carry out the improvement conditions. There Avas no
obligation imposed upon the assigns of a purchaser to make any
improvement at all. The lamentable result Avas this—that Avhere a
purchaser became fraudulently possessed of land, his legal liability
to improve it ceased the moment that he sold it, or transferred it
to the person for whom he Avas acting. A fraudulent selector could
assign his land immediately he took it up; his assignee was not
liable or compellable to carry out improvements ; the very act of
assignment destroyed the operation of those conditions of occupancy.
It Avas the selector only—the bona fide cultivator Avho took up
land and remained in possession of it without assigning—Avho Avag
subject to those conditions. In respect of improvement conditions
also the Duffy Act Avas inferior to the Nicholson Act, bad as that
was. By the Nicholson Act a selector Avas bound to reside on his
rented or purchased land, otherwise the lease was liable to forfeiture.
The necessity of personal residence Avas omitted from the Dufiy Act,
Avhich merely provided in an alternative form that a selector should
either cultivate one acre in ten during the first year after selection or
erect a habitable dwelling on the allotment, or enclose it Avith a
substantial fence. Here, again, the provisions of the Act were emi-
nently favorable to the land monopolist. Residence Avas not 6om-
pulsoxy. A slab hut, or a bush fence, was a sufficient legal com-
pliance Avith the requirements of the remaining alternatives, but
even one of these could not be enforced as against an assign.
In its penal clauses the Act broke doAvn also. An applicant had
to sign a declaration that he applied for an allotment on his oavh
behalf only, and not as agent or trustee for any other person what-
ever. A false declaration exposed him to prosecution for perjury
Two persons, named Taylor and Curtis, Avere prosecuted and con-
victed of conspiracy to procure persons to become selectors of allot-


ments for persons other than themselves; of procuring false state-
ments in a declaration made by the selectors under the Act; and of
procuring false declarations. The Supreme Court, however, quashed
the conviction on the following grounds ;—That the Land Act,
1862, did not forbid all purchases of land by trustees, but on the
contrary, by particularly forbidding in section 20 only such pur-
chases on behalf of infants and married women not judicially
separated from their husbands impliedly permitted such purchases
on behalf of all others ; the schedule to the Act, so far as it added
a declaration that the applicant applied “not as agent or trustee
for any other person whatever,” was repugnant to the Act itself, and
in derogation of common law rights ; that the schedule was of
inferior degree to the Act, and should yield to it, and was of no
avail to make selection by an applicant as an agent or trustee
unlawful; that a false statement respecting an act which the statute
did not prohibit ought not by implication to be deemed a mis-
demeanor under, the statute, and that as the conspiracy charged was
based on an act supposed to be unlawful but not unlawful, the
charge could not be sustained (a).
The Duffy Land Act thus became an absolute wreck of Legisla-
tion. The numerous swindles that were perpetrated under it will
never be forgotten or forgiven. Those swindles are still called to
remembrance with sorrow and indignation by politicians who know
with what wholesale fraud and audacious perjury the people of the
colony and unborn generations were deliberately robbed of nearly
1,000,000 acres of land, constituting the garden of Victoria.
Friends and foes of the o‘Shanassy Ministry admitted that the Land
Act was a disastrous failure, if not a political crime. The Argns
declared that the settlement of the country was not advanced one
step by the sales effected ; that the stability of the public revenue
was seriously impaired and that emigrants when they arrived
hereafter would only come to find the best of the land already
alienated. The Ballarat Star expressed its opinion that the lands
of the colony were being locked up more effectually than ever.
“The speculators,” said that journal (12th September, 1862), “have
high o’er leaped all bounds; they have burst through Duffy’s
securities, and have by their agents obtained possession of a very
large portion of the agricultural lands thrown open for selection.
The £22,000 taken at the land sale here on Wednesday were in a
very small portion paid by intending cultivators. The 1600 acres
that were alienated in one day at the Land Office have not been
purchased by those who mean to use them for themselves, but in the
larger number of cases by the agents of squatters who have found
ready tools to use for their work.” On the 13th of the same month
the Star said —“The great land swindle goes on prosperously.
(a) Wyatt and Webb s reports, p. 23, Law.


Dummies are a positive drug in the market, and the squatters and
their agents carry everything before them.” The Bendigo Advertiser
(15th September, 1862,) declared—“ The Land Act is a mockery, a
delusion, and a snare. The wrong men have got the greater part of
the first land thrown open, and if the system of gazetting agricultural
areas continue after the same prodigal fashion he will be a fortu-
nate farmer who draws an allotment in the future.” The Grenville
Advocate (13th September) said—“ The new Land Act is a miserable
failure. It does not facilitate the acquisition of land by bona Jide
cultivators, and it does facilitate its acquisition by squatters
and speculators.” The Ballarat Tribute , of the same date, asserted—
“ Fraud is a success, the Land Bill is a delusion, and the country is
robbed.” “Is Mr. Duffy a rogue 1 is he a fool 1 ? or is he a com-
pound of both 1” asked the Geelong Advertiser (17th September).
The Ararat Advertiser (16th September) wrote —“Never did the
speculator or squatter find himself so well adjudicated for as in the
present instance, and never was any measure so completely over-
ridden and laughed at by cute Attorneys or exulting sheep farmers
as the last effort of Charles Gavan Duffy. The working of the
people’s measure has inaugurated a perfect millenium for the squat-
ters.” The Leader (20th September) affirmed that-—“ By his (Mr.
Duffy’s) stupidity, or rascality, or a compound of both, he has
brought on the colony a dire calamity.” The public lands, added
that journal, were in process of rapid confiscation through the utter
collapse of all Mr. Duffy’s securites. All the limitations and con-
ditions proposed by Mr. Gray and his friends were contemptously
rejected by Mr. Duffy, whose purchased majority enabled him to over-
turn all opposition. The Land Act was the master piece of his folly,
the partition of the public lands was the compact, the paid hirelings
of the Victorian Association voted as he bade them. The Age was
equally as severe in its condemnation of the Act and its administra-
tors. Mr. Higinbothan afterwards expressed his opinion that the
Act was one of the greatest and most mischievous blunders ever
committed by the Legislature of any country.


CHAPTER Y.
THE LAND ACTS OF 1865 AND 1869.
The Duffy Land Act was described by its author as a compromise,
the result of a compact between the squatters on one side and intend-
ing agricultural settlers on the other. The squatters received nine
years secure tenure with compensation for improvements; the
farmers were to have facilities for selecting agricultural land. The
powerful moneyed class, however, had the lion’s share of the public
spoil, the fruits of this bargain. When the attention of the country
was fairly directed to the scandalous immorality by which the pro-
prietors of large estates were adding square mile after square mile to
their broad acres an universal demand, which no Government could
resist, arose for an amendment of the Act. Accordingly in Feb-
ruary, 1863, Mr. Duffy brought in an amending bill, biit it did not
reach its second reading, owing to the defeat of the O’Shanassy
Ministry on the cognate question of the assessment of stock. Under
the Land Act the rent of a run was at the rate of Is. 6d. per sheep
and 2s. per head of cattle which it was capable of carrying ; and
the grazing capabilities of the run were determined by arbitration.
The Ministry expected to obtain about £500,000 per year as rent
of runs. But when the awards were made by the arbitrators it
turned out that the revenue from this source would not nearly come
up to the estimate. The Government then brought down a resolu-
tion for the purpose of reviving the system of assessment and
license fees which previously prevailed, and under which the pastoral
tenants paid rent, not on the grazing capabilities of their runs, but
on stock actually depastured thereon. The resolution was negatived
by a majority of 16, and Mr. O’Shanassy and his colleagues resigned.
Mr. M‘Culloch then formed his first Government, consisting of him-
self, Chief Secretary; Mr. Higinbotham, Attorney-General; Mr.
Richard Heales, Commissioner of Lands ; Mr. Yerdon, Treasurer;
Mr. Francis, Commissioner of Trade and Customs ; Mr. Grant,
Commissioner of Railways ; Mr. Sullivan, Minister of Mines ; Mr.
Hervey (Legislative Council), Commissioner of Public Works. One
of the first acts of the new Ministry was to introduce a Bill for the


amendment of the Land Legislation of 1862. Its principal pro-
visions were :—l. That selectors could apply for land in blocks of
from 40 to 640 acres each at the price of 20s. per acre, and, in the
case of plurality of application for one allotment in the same day,
priority was determined by lot. 2. Ihe selector paid down ss. per
acre of the purchase money, and the balance by annual instalments
of 2s. 6d. per acre, the mortgaging or selling of selections being pro-
hibited. 3. The conditions of selection were cultivation and residence.
If these conditions were not complied with during the six years
allowed for payment of the balance of purchase money the State
could take back the land. 4. Lands thrown open for selection
could not be sold by auction till after the lapse of three years from
proclamation. 5. Selectors on fencing in their allotment were to
have all the rights of owners against trespassers. 6. No infant or
married woman co.uld select. 7. Arbitrators appointed to deter-
mine the grazing capabilities of runs were empowered to go below
the assessment of 1861, and power was given to the individual and
to the Government to appeal to the Supreme Court to review any
arbitration which was “fraudulent, erroneous, and unjust.” _ The
Bill was, however, rejected by the Legislative Council by a majority
of six. _ ,
’ In February, 1867, Mr Heales brought in a second Land Bill,
dealing with pastoral and agricultural lands. There were several
new principles incorporated in this Bill which are entitled to notice.
In the first place it proposed a system of selection by leasing instead
of by.conditional sale and it reduced the size of agricultural allot-
ments. A person could apply for a lease of 320 acres in a pro-
claimed area on which he had to pay a rent of Is. 6d. per acre foi
five years. At the end of that time if he had complied with the
conditions of occupancy he could get the crown grant at the upset
price of <£l per acre. The conditions were; —1. That the land
should be fenced in within one year after selection. 2. That the
selector resided on the land for three years. 3. That the selector
should not mortgage or assign his lease. 4. The Minister of Lands
should be satisfied by proof that the settler had complied with, and
had not violated any conditions before his right to the freehold
was admitted. The Bill also proposed to enable the Government
to grant 10 years leases of grazing farms, containing four blocks of
a mile square each —2560 acres. This Bill was passed by the As-
sembly but was thrown out by the Council. Parliament was shortly
afterwards dissolved. The cardinal questions submitted to the
country were the revision of the tariff and the amendment of the
Land Act of 1862.
Mr. James Macpherson Grant, who became Minister of Lands on
the retirement and death of Mr. Richard Heales, unfolded the
Ministerial Land scheme on the occasion of addressing his constituents


at Inglewood. “I have adopted in this scheme,” he said, “ that is
propounded on behalf of the Government, this principle of selection
—that bona fide settlement should precede alienation of any descrip-
tion ; that not an acre fit for agricultui’al purposes shall be alienated
until the person who selects it shall have given evidence to the State;
and the best evidence to the State, that he is a bona fide selector,
by the improvement that he puts upon his allotments.” “I am not
a theoriser or a philosopher,” the hon. gentleman went on to say, “but
I pretend to be what I am, a practical man, and I endeavour, when I
find a system which has produced good results, to extend and im-
prove it.” Ministers were returned with a substantial working
majority, and on 7th December, 1864, Mr. Grant moved the second
reading of their Land Bill. It will be here convenient to consider
the various aspects of the land question which at this time com-
manded the attention of Parliament.
At the passing of the Nicholson Act about 3,944,139 acres of
Victorian land had been alienated, and at the passing of the Duffy
Act, that number had been increased to 4,896,044 acres—in round
numbers. Under the Nicholson Act 4814 selections were granted,
comprising an ai’ea of 410,600 acres of purchased land, axxd 1807
sub-divisions were x'ented at Is. per acre per anxxuxn, comprising axi
area of 147,172 acres. Uxxder the Duffy Act, 8008 oixlixxary
selections were made, comprising axx area of 1,363,243 acres.
In 1862, whexx the Dufiy Act became law, 651 pastoral texiaxxts
were set down in returns coxxxpiled by the Laxxds department
as owners of 1,934,300 acres of pastoral laxxds oxx which a rebate
of assessment was claimed. In additioxx to this it was esti-
mated that 300,000 acres had beexx purchased by pastoral texiaxxts
whose runs had been absorbed by the pressure of gold-fields
population, and this land was xxot included in the returns referred
to. Another return prepared by the Lands department showed
that 110 pastoral tenants had selected 932,000 acres under the
Duffy Act. In other words, of about one and a quarter million
acres sold under that enactment, nearly a million went to 110
persons. This made up an approximate total of over 3,000,000 acres
out of 6,000,000 acres alienated which were taken up by large
landed proprietors up to December, 1864 (a). Such were the results
of sales by auction under Imperial legislation, of limited auction
under the Act of 1860, and of selection at an uxxiform price com-
bined with the lot system uxxder the Act of 1862. The average
pxfice of country laxxds sold by auctioxx xxp to that date was only £1
7s. 6d per acre, axxd yet the advocates of the auctioxx system cluxxg
tenaciously to it as the only souxxd px-ixxciple according to which land
should be dealt with. Let there be free trade in laxxd, they urged;
let land be treated as every other article of commerce, let it go to

the highest bidder. On tlic other hand the Liberal party contended
that the price of land afforded no adequate consideration equal to the
settlement of people on the soil. Suppose, they asked, if instead of
selling 3,000,000 acres to six or seven hundred persons at £1 7s. 6d.
per acre that land had fallen into the hands of the 600,000 persons at
£1 per acre, would not that have been a result infinitely more
advantageous to the State for all time to come 1 How then had not
satisfactory settlement been secured under the measures of 1860
and 1862, which pretended to promote and facilitate that progres-
sive policy 1 Because, the reply was, the conditions under which land
was selected for cultivation, and the tests of the hona fide character
of a selector were not sufficiently stringent to battle against the
superior power of money coupled with fraud, perjury, and every
form of cunning. It was to remedy these defects that Mr. Grant
now brought in his amending Bill.
The Bill proposed that there should be free selection after survey
in proclaimed agricultural areas, and that selectors should be entitled
to take up allotments of from 40 to 640 acres in extent. Each allot-
ment was to be held on lease for five years at 2s. per acre per annum
rent. Applications for leases had to be made in person to a land
officer. On the day appointed for receiving applications for leases,
if two or more applicants attended the land office, the order of
application was determined by lot. Every lease when granted con-
tained covenants: —1. For payment of rent, half yearly, in advance.
2. For non-assignment of lease within one year of its commencement,
and not then, unless certain improvements had been carried out.
3. For personal residence during three years after which he could
buy at £1 per acre, without competition. 4. For the carrying
out, within two years, of improvements to the value of £1 per
acre of the leased land. 5. If a lessee effected, within one year,
these improvements—consisting of clearing, fencing, draining, build-
ing, making reservoirs, &c.,—he could have the improvements valued
and the allotment put up to auction at an upset price of £1 per
acre. No person was allowed, within any period of twelve months,
to become lessee, sub-lessee, or assignee of more than 640 acres.
No infant or married woman living with her husband could become
the lessee, sub-lessee, or assignee of an allotment, nor could any
person lease land as the agent, servant, or trustee, of another. One
important clause, known afterwards as the 42nd, gave the Governor
power to grant licenses for a period of one year, which entitled
the holders thereof respectively to reside on or cultivate any land,
on any gold-field, or land adjacent thereto, not exceeding 20 acres
in extent, subject to payment of such fee and on such terms and
conditions as should be approved of by the Governor. Another
clause appropriated land revenue towards assisted immigration.
Forfeited land and land opened for selection and not selected for


12 months could be sold by auction to the extent of 400,000 acres
per annum. Lessees were to have all the right of owners, except
the right of impounding, and they obtained that as soon as they
fenced their allotments.
There are several features in the outlines of the Bill above
sketched which deserve attention, as they contained the germs of
very important principles of land legislation, which afterwards
developed into full bloom. In the first place, it will be seen,
that the Bill provided for residental and non-residental selectors.
If a man resided on his selection for three years and improved
it to the value of £1 per acre, he could purchase it at the
upset price of £1 per acre at any time after that during the
currency of the lease. To enable professional men, tradesmen and
miners who could not reside on country lands to take up allotments
it was provided that if a lessee made improvements to the value of
£1 per acre within two years of the commencement of the lease he
could then have his improvements valued and thq land put up to
auction at the upset price of £1 per acre. If he did not become
the purchaser he received the value of the improvements. A new
mode of determining the order and priority of selection within an
agricultural area was introduced by this Bill. Under the Dufly Land
Act if there were a number of applicants for one allotment, priority
was determined by lot. The consequence was that the moment a
land office was open for the reception of applications it was rushed
by an excited crowd ; the strongest got in first and the weakest
went to the wall. Dummies also applied for one allotment, so
as to out-number the bona fide, applicant and reduce his chances in
the ballot box. When Mr. Ileales’ second Land Bill was before
the House (25th February 1865) Mr Berry suggested that these
evils might be remedied by a simple expedient. Let all the
selectors who made applications at one office oh the same day be
placed on an equal footing—each having a chance of obtaining the
right of first selecting any allotment in the whole of an agricultural
area thrown open for selection. By this means the order of selec-
tion generally, and not the right to any particular allotment, would
be fixed by lot. By this means also, it would be according to the
doctrine of probabilities almost impossible for any organization to
succeed in taking up a large number of contiguous allotments
for the benefit of a particular squatter or land speculator (a). Thus
the man who obtained the first chance would be entitled to examine
the plans first and select which allotment he wanted, whilst the other
applicants would select in the order determined by the drawing of
lots. This was the plan adopted and incorporated in the Land Bill
now under consideration. The 42nd clause was evidently founded
on the principle of the occupation licenses. It was a short
(a) Hansard, vol. 10 p. 149,


clause of a few lines surrounded by no conditions, giving few
legal rights, enabling no resort to the Supreme Court, to justices, or
arbitrators, yet it contained, within itself, the seed plot of a power
not then fully understood. That clause, simple though despotic as
it undoubtedly was, conferred on the Minister of Lands a power as
great as that attempted to be exercised under the occupation licenses,
and it proved the salvation of the Act of 1865 (a). It was sug-
gested to Mr. Higinbotham by a public servant at Daylesford, who
informed the Attorney-General, that a number of persons were occu-
pying Crown Lands on and near goldfields which they would be
glad to pay for provided they could obtain security of tenure. Mr.
Higinbotham placed the proposal before Mr. Heales, and it was
adopted by his successor, Mr. Grant.
The gist of the Bill was the provision relating to probationary
leases. The rent paid during the currency of a lease was not to
go towards the purchase money. A selector was to remain a Crown
tenant for a cei’tain time, during which he had to show, by residence
and improvement, that he was not a dummy, but occupied the land
for his own use and benefit. Objection was raised to this proposal
by Mr. o‘Shanassy and others, who used arguments which are
generally raked up in opposition to every scheme for the preservation
and protection of the lands of the State. It was contended that the
■State would not be able to collect the rents ; that causes would arise,
such as bad harvests, sickness and disaster, which would prevent
the punctual payment of rent, and then political influence would be
brought to bear, and the rents would be waived or made part of the
purchase money; or that if the rents were regularly paid during
the five years, many farmers would make use of their leases to
exhaust the soil, and then lease the land. To this it was answered
that the rents or instalments of purchase money were regularly
paid under the Nicholson and Duffy Acts, and that there would be
no more difficulty experienced in securing the payment of rent than
payment of successive instalments of purchase money. The rents
payable under the occupation licenses were also collected without
any practical difficulty. To say that tenants would exhaust the soil
which they expected to buy was contradictory of the results of
human experience. As regards the possibility of agitations for
the conversion of rent into purchase money, the success of such
a movement would depend upon the will of the majority of the
people and the honesty of the legislature, and there was no reason to
believe that the majority of the population would allow the Legis-
lature to violate the terms of a solemn contract dealing with the
property of the state.
The Dufly Land Act set apart 10,000,000 acres for agricultural
settlement, and none of the land comprised within this area so re-

served could be sold by auction until after it had been proclaimed and
open for selection for three years. That Act also rendered it impera-
tive that at least 2,000,000 acres should be always kept open for
selection in agricultural areas. But by Mr. Grant’s Bill, these reser-
vations and distinctions of land were abolished. Any of the land
delineated on the map mentioned in the 12th section of the Act of
1862 could be sold by auction after the lapse of 12 months from the
passing of the amending Act. So that under the law as proposed by
this Bill the best part of the country could, at the discretion of the
Minister, be sold by auction. The Bill truly provided that persons
should be able to select land in proclaimed areas, but it failed to
state to what extent land would have to be proclaimed as open to
agricultural selection. The quantity of land which might be sold
by auction was practically. unlimited. “In principle,” said Mr.
Gillies, member for Ballarat West, “it is an auction bill, and selec-
tion is its incident” (a). “ The measure,” said Mr. Berry, “is
simply auction in disguise” (n). It was asked—How was this Bill
consistent with Mr. Grant’s speech at Inglewood, that not an acre
would be alienated until bona fide evidence was given that the land
would be settled and cultivated 1 But this pre-disposition in favor
of the auction system was not the only characteristic of the Bill
which favored the squatting party. Auction was to be applied
universally inside and outside 10,000,000 acres; at any rate, that
area was not absolutely set apart for selection; to that extent
the squatting tenure was rendered more secure. The squatters
then occupied 32,231,000 acres, and paid £228,000 rent per annum,
or £55,000 less then what they paid under the system of assess-
ment. The Duffy Act failed to secure a rental equivalent to the
estate or the security of title given to the squatters. The McCulloch
Ministry did not ask the House to revise the system of valuation
of runs, because they said it would amount to repudiation to depart
from the terms of the settlement made by the Act of 1862. In
reply to this excuse for not grappling with the question, Ministers
were taunted with having been placed and kept in power by the
squatters, who having made use of Mr Duffy, coalesced against him
when he proposed to re-adjust the rent on runs. Besides, it was
urged with unanswerable force, if the Band Act, 1862, was passed,
as it was said to have been, by bribery and corruption, it ought
not now to be flung in the hon. members’ faces to prevent them
from securing a fair equivalent for the public teritory.
The Bill was read a second time without a division. On the
motion that the Speaker leave the chair, howerer, Mr. John
M‘Gregor, member for Rodney, moved—“ That inasmuch .as the
means provided by the present Land Act have failed in obtaining a
fair and sufficient rental for the pastoral lands of the Crown, and as
i (B) Id p. 70.


that measure distinctly provides that no occupier of land for pastoral
purposes shall, by reason of its being hereafter repealed or altered,
be entitled to any compensation, this blouse is of opinion that it
is just and expedient that provision should at once be made for
securing to the state the payment of an increased and adequate
return for the use of the public lands for pastoral purposes.” The
amendment was negatived by a majority of 27.
Some important amendments in the Bill were made in committee.
The term of five years for leases was extended to seven years. The
period of one year within which no assignment of a lease should
be allowed was extended to three years. In the clause allowing
non-residental selectors, who had improved their allotments to the
extent of £1 per acre, to apply to have the land put up to auction
with a valuation for improvements after the expiration of a year
from the beginning of the lease, the term of three years was substi-
tuted for one year. The clause relating to the sale of forfeited and un-
selected land was amended so as to allow such land to be open for
selection for three years instead of a year, and reducing the amount
of land that could be sold by auction from 400,000 to 200,000 per
year. The clause which was complained of as abolishing the reser-
vation of the 10,000,000 acres delineated in the map, mentioned in
the 12th section of the Duffy Act, was amended so as to provide
that none of those lands except those reserved for towns and villages
should be sold by auction unless such lands as had been proclaimed
open for selection on lease for a period of three years, save in special
cases.
The Bill passed through the Assembly, and its second reading in
the Council was carried without a division. Several amendments
were made, to which the Assembly refused to assent, and a con-
ference was held. The points in dispute were settled as follows-
1. The Council agreed not to insist on its amendment that land
unselected or unleased within one year after proclamation should
be put up for sale by auction, the original term of three being
retained. 2. The Council gave way to the question of fencing
roads, and consented to the provisions against such fencing being
made applicable to surveyed roads. 3. The Assembly agreed that
compensation should be given for entry on lands sold under the
Act of 1862 by the licensees of dams, races, and reservoirs ; that no
members of Borough or Shire Councils, or Hoad Boards, should be
managers of commons, and that section 47 of the Act of 1862,
known as the “novel industries” clause should be repealed.
The principle of probationary leases embodied in the Land Act
of 1865 appeared to be a sound one. It was founded on the desire
of, and necessity for, the State as landlord, to keep a hold on the
selector and to fully control him, and to see that he performed the
conditions prescribed by law before giving him a Crown grant. It


is a melancholy duty to relate that wise, fair, and apparently
effectual as this probationary condition seemed, it was not able to
defeat the fraudulent schemes of those determined to defeat and
degrade the law. The skilful wire-pullers of the dummy system
discovered a means of turning the amended law to their own ad-
vantage. They caused their hirelings to select land as hitherto, and
fulfil the conditions in a perfunctory manner; meanwhile, they
either secured secret transfers, to become operative at the end of the
probationary period, or manoeuvred to get the selection forfeited,
and sold by auction. The control over the great body of selectors
which it was expected the minister would be able to exercise was
more fictitious than real, owing to want of sufficient discretionary
and inquisitorial power. Thus, whilst the new system was evaded by
determined opponents, its penal clauses pressed heavily on bona
fide settlers who had neither motive nor capital to avoid fulfilling
its conditions. While some political prophets were predicting with
indignation what actually took place, that selectors would in time,
begin to agitate that the rent should go towards the purchase
money, they overlooked the circumstance, that by the Act of 1865,
the rent of 2s. per acre for three years when added to the purchase
money, £1 per acre, actually raised the price of land to £1 6s. per
acre. They further neglected to consider the fact, that, whilst
a farmer had to pay 2s. per acre rent to the State and carry out
valuable and expensive improvements, a pastoral tenant was allowed
to occupy Crown Lands at a rental of 1 |d. per acre without being
required to improve them. Again, by the Land Acts of 1860, and
1862, under which the most valuable land in the country was taken
up, the periodic payments were not treated as rent, but part of the
purchase money. So it followed that under the Legislation of 1865,
an agriculturalist had to pay 6s. per acre extra for land inferior to
that which could have been selected under the old law. In truth opin-
ions were for a long time divided as to what would be the practical
result of Mr. Grant’s first Act. The circumstances under which the
McCulloch Ministry obtained office gave rise to the suspicions that
their Land Bill was framed pre-eminently in the interest of the
squatters. The large power of sale by auction claimed by the Bill
seemed to give color to the suspicions. As against that, were the
re-iterated assertions of the Minister of Lands that not an acre of
land should be alienated until the bona fide intentions of applicants
were evidenced by settlement. It was not until the Act came into
operation that the dubious and dangerous nature of some of its
details became apparent.
It was found that the conditions of, and impediments to, selec-
tion, were sufficiently exacting and stringent to press heavily upon
men of small means, but that they did not extinguish the dummy
system. The squatters, by the aid of dummies, were still able to


carry on their systematic frauds. In some dista'icts the general
selection clauses of the Act were productive of a vast amount of
good, hut in other districts thousands of acres opened for selection
during the first year of the operation of the Act, fell into the hands
of squatting proprietors. The obstacles in the way of selection
were it was asserted, considerably increased by the dilatory conduct
of the Minister of Lands in not surveying, and proclaiming for
selection, the quantity of land directed to be so open by the Act.
Section 10 of the Act provided that not less than 4,000,000 acres
of land should be open for selection within three months after
the Act became law, and that 2,000,000 acres should be con-
stantly kept open. This provision was completely ignored, not-
withstanding, that Parliament voted .£2,000 in order to expedite
the surveys. Many of the so called agricultural areas were mere
sham areas, consisting only of nine or ten allotments. Selectors
travelled about the country, spending their money in vain, seeking
for land. Under the Act of 1862, no land within the 10,000,000
acres area set apart for the agricultural purposes could be sold by
auction until they had been opened for selection for at least three
years. After the passing of Mr. Grant’s Act, land which had been
proclaimed open for selection under the Act of 1862, but which had
not been selected was immediately closed against selection and
sold by auction. Thousands of acres were selected by dummies
and left unimproved, for the very purpose of inducing the Minister
to forfeit the selections and sell them by auction and in numerous
cases this dodge was eminently successful. The conditions of proba-
tionary leases were as severe upon bona fide settlers as they were
favorable to dummies, whose object was to secure the forfeiture and
sale of selections by auction. These werje some of the early criti-
cisms passed upon the Act, and Mr. Grant’s administration of it.
His defence, if not quite satisfactory, suggests at any rate the
peculiar difficulties of the situation and its problem. When the
first selections took place at Hamilton and Camperdown it was
found that the land officers in their endeavours to comply with the
provisions of the Act, had unwittingly thrown open the whole of
certain runs. He then resolved, subject to the approval of the
Assembly, to exercise his discretion as to what portion of the public
territory should be thrown open for selection. Had he carried out
the strict letter of the law by proclaiming 4,000,000 within three
months he would have ruined hundreds of squatters, and he con-
sidered that the good sense and feeling of the community suggested
that it was improper this should be done.
What is to be specially noted however, is the fact, that notwith-
standing the delicate consideration shown by the Minister of Lands
to the interests of the pastoral tenants in his neglect to carry out
the commands of an Act of Parliament, these gentlemen did not


show a corresponding respect to the law of the country, or the
terms of the compact, by which they obtained their nine years
leases. The land racket commenced under the Duffy Act was
continued with aggravated energy. Persons, drafted from nearly
every class of the population, were yarded up as it were for the
purpose of acting as dummies. Taverns were kept open for the
accomodation of gangs of dummies; stage coaches were with un-
blushing effrontery engaged from day to day to carry the dummies
from sale to sale. Here, again, comes in another explanation by Mr.
Grant, to account for the paucity of allotments thrown open for
selection. He was compelled, he said, to withdraw from selection
a large number of proclaimed areas when he found that the pro-
visions of the Act did not protect bona fide settlers.
Two clauses of this Act which became potent agents for the dis-
tribution and loss of the public estate deserve special attention in
this sad record of the embezzlement of the lands of the state—the
solicitors’ certificates, and volunteers’ certificates, are now referred
to. By the Land Act of 1862, any person seised in law or equity
of lands in fee simple within the colony purchased prior to the
passing of the Act of 1860, was entitled to select and lease an
allotment of Crown Lands in any agricultural area, and hold the
same under lease on the same terms and in the same manner as ordi-
nary selectors,but the area which such an owner could select and lease,
was not to exceed the extent of land of which he was seised, and in
no case could it exceed 320 acres. This clause, known as Cummins’
clause, was passed in order to confer certain advantages upon people
who had, prior to 1860, purchased land at high prices and without
deferred payments. Certificates, enabling holders of land coming
within the meaning and qualification of the clause to exercise this
privilege, could be obtained from the Crown Solicitor, but it was
obligatory on them to apply for the certificates and use them within
12 months from the passing of the Act. This provision, which was
said to be justifiable on reasonable grounds, and was supported by
Mr. Wilson Gray, who thought it might assist bona fide settlement,
was eventually converted into a cunningly devised scheme for the ag-
gregation of squatting properties. When the real effect, and possible
use, of this clause became evident to the world, it was boldly asserted
that it had been placed in the Act as nothing more nor less than
a bribe to the landed proprietors to induce them to help the squat-
ters to obtain a good Land Act, and this statement was not success-
fully contradicted. The jobbery and corruption which took place in
connection with these certificates became a notorious public scan-
dal. It must be observed that there was a limit of time within
which these land certificates could be applied for and used. Owing
to the sudden suspension of selection under the Duffy Act, many
scores of persons entitled to certificates did not apply for them,


whilst many who had obtained them, did not, and could not select
within the time limited. Mr. Richard Heales, whilst in office,
denounced the unused certificates, and said they were not worth
the paper on which they were written. This brought them into
general disrepute as securities. But the Land Act of 1865 re-
enacted Cummins’ clause in a modified form. Section 7 provided
that any person who had, before the passing of this Act, became
entitled, under the Land Act of 1862, to select or purchase land
within twelve months from the date of the Act, and the executors,
administrators, and assigns of such person might, subject to all the
limitations, conditions, restrictions, and obligations attached by the
Act to such selection or purchase, exercise the right of selection or
purchase, upon making application to the Board of Land and Works
at any time within twelve months after the passing of the amending
Act. A stringent provision was added giving the Board of Land
and Works power to make regulations for the purpose of enforcing
the conditions and obligations attached to selection, and of pre-
venting the violation or evasion of any of the provisions of the
Act of 1862. These certificates were assignable, and they soon became
the subjects of an enormous amount of traffic. The squatters bought
up every available certificate at prices ranging from ss. per acre
represented in each certificate. A legal difficulty of an unexpected
character arose which somewhat disconcerted the proceedings of the
pastoral tenants. Were persons who selected land by virtue of
certificates in the same positions as regards rights and duties as
ordinary selectors under the Duffy Act 1 If so they would have to
comply with the conditions of occupancy prescribed by section 36
of that Act. —“ Every selector of an allotment, as aforesaid, within
one year after he becomes a selector, shall cultivate at least one
acre out of every ten acres thereof, or shall erect thereon a habitable
dwelling, or shall enclose such allotment with a substantial fence.”
By sec. 126, a selector who did not, within one year, either culti-
vate, or build a dwelling, or fence in his allotment, was liable to a
penalty of ss. per acre. It was generally admitted that owing either
to design or accident, the improvement clauses of the Duffy Act could
not be enforced as against the assigns of original selectors, and
seeing that certificates could be assigned, the grave question was
raised, whether the conditions could be enforced against the assigns
of certificate holders. The proviso referred to in the 7th clause
of the Act of 1865, enabled the Government to insert condi-
tions in leases to be granted to certificate holders and their
assigns, for the purpose of preventing evasions and violations of
the Act of 1862. Among other things, the Government inserted
a covenant in these leases by which the lessee undertook “ to
cultivate one acre out of every ten, or erect a habitable dwell-
ing, or enclose with a substantial fence”. In one case an ap-


plicant for a lease refused to subscribe to this covenant, and on the
Government declining to issue the lease without it, he commenced
a suit against the Crown to compel the issue of the lease. The
Full Court, reversing the decision of the primary judge, decided that
the conditions which the plaintiff had been asked to sign were wise
and fair, just to the state, and not unjust to the selector, and per-
fectly legal (a). This decision proved a great blow to the holders
of certificate selections, as it compelled them to carry out the condi-
tion of improvement which they were anxious to escape. A bill
was then brought into the Assembly by Mr. R. B. Tucker, of Kyne-
ton, to relieve them from the awkward dilemma. It was entitled
“ a bill to quiet the titles of selectors of land under certificates.”
From the outset it was plain that this bill was not introduced in
the interests of the original holders of certificates. They had sold
out long previously at reduced prices ] the squatters and money
lenders had got hold of bushels of these certificates which they
wanted to convert into leasehold, or freehold security on easy terms.
Whilst the Bill was under discussion, tfce lobbies of the House
were invaded by the minions and agents of the squatters, and bank
managers were actively engaged in beating up recruits to vote for
it. Notwithstanding the earnest and indignant protests of Mr.
Grant and Mr. Higinbotham, the second reading was carried by a
majority of two. The Bill, however, was lost in committee, and
subsequently, Mr. Charles Edwin Jones was expelled the House
for having accepted a bribe to vote for it. Ihe rebuff thus re-
ceived by the certificate system, no doubt, saved many thousands of
valuable acres to the country. As it was no loss than 3,841 selec-
tions comprising 616,415 acres were made under the provisions of
the Act of 1862, and 1865, relating to solicitors’ certificates.
As an illustration of the chicanery and fraud which squatters
practised to defeat the law and rob the state of its land, some of
the expedients adopted may be mentioned. In order to comply
with the condition of fencing, the pastoral tenant would enclose
large tracts of Crown lands with very suspicious structures, and
within these tracts they would select on certificates. These so-
called fences were then claimed and set down as a compliance
with the requirements of the certificate leases, although as a matter
of fact, they did not touch the boundaries of the selected allotment.
Yet it was said that as the fences included these allotments, together
with Crown lands, therefore the selected allotments were fenced.
In cases where these fences were disallowed or were inconvenient
to adopt, the pastoral tenant erected “a habitable dwelling” upon
the allotment of the following description:—Fie had a small
movable house, made of a light deal frame, covered with galvanised
iron, nine feet long, seven feet wide, and six feet high to the wall
(a) Kettle v. QueCn, 3 Wyatt, Webb and A'Becket Reports.


plates, formed in six pieces, consisting of two sides and two ends
(with gables), and two sides of the roof. Taken to pieces, it was
carried on a dray to the allotment selected. Four blocks were
sunk in the ground about eight or nine inches, and standing from
three to five inches out of the ground. The sides and ends of the
house were quickly fixed on the blocks, and fastened together by
screws ; the two portions of the roof were affixed in like manner;
a small iron fire-place screwed on, a nail driven through the foot-
plates into each block, and the building was then pronounced
by the builders complete. It had a door, and an aperture
covered with calico, for a window. It took about twenty minutes
to erect, was at once taken down, put on the dray, and removed to
another allotment to undergo the same operation. The builders
made notes of the erection of this “ habitable dwelling upon each
allotment, so as to be prepared to prove that it had been erected
upon the specific allotment on the day noted. This one dwelling
served to prove compliance with the certificate leases of selec-
tion in the several areas, and was of course a very convenient and
happy mode of defrauding the country. In other parts of the
country where this mode of compliance with the law was too civil-
ized and scientific for adoption, an ordinary bark hut was erected
and described as a habitable dwelling. On easy terms such
as these, the pastoral tenants exercised the privilege of free
selection.
By the sth section of the Act of 1865, every officer, non-com-
missioned officer, and member of the Volunteer Force of Victoria
who was unpaid, who was enrolled at the passing of the Act,
and who served as an effective for not less than five years, wa's
entitled to receive a certificate equivalent in value to £5O towards
the purchase money or rent of any Crown Lands. At the time
this clause was passed there were 2900 effective volunteers in the
colony, and if that number remained effective for the period men-
tioned, they would receive grants of land equal to £145,000 in
value. This provision was never applied for by the volunteers jit
was a gift on the part of the House. When it became law it was
found to be of little avail in promoting settlement. Most the
volunteers were young men residents of and engaged in business
in towns, who were unable to work 50 acre farms. It was not
long, however, before an effort was made to render these volunteer
certificates negotiable, like the certificates under Cummins clause.
They were unassignable at law and an attempt made to carry a
resolution in the Assembly affirming the desirability of rendering
them transferrable was defeated. The law was evaded with the
usual dexterity. Although the Minister of Lands could prevent
the sale and transfer of certificates, he could not prevent the
sale and transfer of lands purchased by the certificates. Volun-


teers who wished to turn their certificates into casli instead of land
sold to land owners the authority to buy on their behalf and gave
the certificates into the bargain. Certificates representing land worth
£5O were passed to those not intended to be benefitted, who only
paid from £3O to £4O for them. The traffic in certificates
increased to such an extent that the liability of the country for land
under this head became somewhat alarming. The number of certifi-
cates issued in 1867 was 719, representing £35,950 ; in 1868, 276,
representing £13,350. Up to the time of the financial statement in
1869 the value of land appropriated in this way amounted to about
£lOO,OOO. It was found that the volunteers had not, as expected,
taken up, and settled on, the land covered by the certificates but
had sold it to the squatters. The unfortunate experiment added
another to the long and melancholy catalogue of injurious land
laws.
After this wearisome review of legislative disasters, ministerial
blunders, dummyism, bribery, corruption, land certificates con-
verted into transferable scrip and sold like green-backs, and of every
form of legalised iniquity, it is a relief to turn to a section of Mr.
Grant’s Act which slipped in without notice and without debate, and
yetwhich, as previously hinted, proved the salvation of the measure,
placed thousands of people upon the soil, and saved Mr. Grant’s name
from absolute disgrace. The 42nd clause became a household word
throughout Victoria before the Act was long in force, and it was par-
ticularly popular among goldfields’ population, for whose benefit, no
doubt, it was specially designed. This clause took the place of, and
carried on, the great work of settlement so well begun under the
occupation licenses. It was founded on the principle of those
licenses. Its general terms gave the Minister enormous power and
almost unfettered discretion. Although the terms of the section
prohibited the granting of a licence covering more than 20 acres
the Minister was not thereby prohibited from granting more than
one license to one applicant. The rule was laid down that the
Minister would allow four licences to each bona fide applicant, thus
enabling him to select a farm of 80 acres in area. The rent charged
was 2s. per acre per annum. By virtue of the power conferred on
the Minister, regulations were promulgated from time to time, pre-
scribing the manner and conditions of selection under this clause.
Its operation was not confined to goldfields, or even to localities
within close proximity to goldfields. The Minister, in the exercise
of his discretion, proclaimed areas open for selection under this
clause distant as far as 30 miles from goldfields. The facilities for
agricultural settlement presented by this law were swiftly recognised
and largely embraced by the industrial classes. In less than
three years 25,000 licenses were issued to 13,000 bona fide cul-
tivators,


The total amount of selection which took place during, and under
the operation of, this clause from 23rd March, 1865, to 31st
December, 1869, was—l7,o3B holdings, containing 786,088 acres,
the average size of each holding being 46 acres. During the same
period only 5,900 ordinary selections were made, comprising the
gigantic area of 1,499,910 acres. The secret of the success of the
42nd clause was that it gave the head of the department responsible
to Parliament complete control of the leased land, and he could pre-
vent it from being mis-applied, or transferred to land sharks and
dummy-mongers. It was the only redeeming feature of the Land
Act, 1865 ; it suggested the leading idea of, and prepared the way
for, the Land Act of 1869.
Neither the general principles nor the administration of the land
Act of 1865 gave satisfaction to the country. The rent of 2s. per
acre that did not go towards the purchase money pressed heavily
on selectors, and hundreds of holdings taken up by steady, honest,
hard working men were forfeited, together with improvements,
which went to the state. The value of improvements thus confiscated
under this Act amounted to £IOO,OO0 —a tremendous sum, when it
is remembered that it was drawn from the savings of ruined families.
The enormous quantities of land thrown into the market and sold
by auction gave rise to a suspicion which soon grew into a strong
belief, that the popular minister was playing into the hands of the
capitalist, whilst professing to be the people’s friend. More land was
sold by auction during Mr. Grant’s long reign in the land depart-
ment than during the term of office of any other Minister of Lands in
Victoria. Under his Land Act 680,607 acres were sold under
the hammer, whilst the alienation by that mode under preceding
Acts were—Land Act, 1860,398,862acre5; Land Act, 1862,456,705.
It was, therefore, not surprising that long before the time fixed for
the expiration of the Acts of 1862 and 1865, strong organisations
were established throughout the country in favor of a radical
change in the existing land system. On Ist December, 1868, a
conference of land reform delegates representing associations all over
the colony was held at the Albion Hotel, Melbourne. There were
twenty delegates present. The following scheme was unanimously
adopted:—That at the expiration of two years after the land has
been taken up, if the selector has satisfied the Board of Land and
Works of his having carried out the improvements required by the
present Amending Land Act, the rent from that date shall be
credited to him as part of the purchase money, and that all pay-
ments shall be at the rate of 2s. per acre per annum, and that the
Act be made retrospective. That, at the expiration of two years
after the granting of the lease or license, upon the bona jides of the
selector being proved, a certificate of title upon payment of the
first instalment of ten yearly payments of 25., be issued to the holder


of the said lease or license. That selectors under the 42nd section
of the Act have the right of purchase at the fixed price of 20s. per
acre at the end of three years, if they have complied with the condi-
tions of the Act. That selectors under the 42nd clause be allowed
to select annually.
These proposals were embodied in a memorial and presented to
Mr. Grant who promised to place them before the Cabinet. They
formed the basis of a bill, which Mr. Grant brought in on 24th
May following, to amend and consolidate the laws relating to the
sale and occupation of Crown lands. The Bill was divided into
two parts, the first dealt with agricultural settlement and the second
with the squatters’ tenure. It was proposed to abolish selection
by lot introduced by the Act of 1862, and the probationary leases,
and non-residence selections which formed the main feature of the
Act of 1865. In place of those systems it was proposed with cer-
tain reservations to extend the principle of selection before and
after survey, and the operation of the famous 42nd clause over the
entire territory with this difference —that the intending settler would
be able to select 640 acres on license, and that after paying rent at
2s. per acre for three years, and residing on and cultivating the
allotment during the same period, the rents would cease, and he
would be able to purchase the Crown grant of the lands at £1 per
acre each, or pay the purchase money in instalments at the rate of
2s. per year. The Governor-in-Council was vested with the sole
and absolute power of determining whether a licensee fulfilled the
covenants of his license or not; whether he was a dummy or
whether he was guilty of any fraud, or trickery. Such questions
were to be for ever withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the ordinary
courts of law The Minister of Lands was, in future, to exercise
the duties and functions of state landlord. With regard to the
pastoral tenure, the bill proposed that the squatters licenses should
be renewed for ten years at a rental of Bd. per sheep and 4s. per
head for cattle and horses.
At the time of the introduction of this bill the territory of Vic-
toria stood as follows i—9,750,409 acres were alienated by auction
and selection ; 484,520 acres were used as roads, &c.; 2,000,000
acres were reserved as commons. Ihe remainder of the public
estate was either unoccupied or was held as pastoral runs. The
country under pastoral occupation was as follows ;
ACRES.
Mallee country, waterless ... 4,104,606
Partial mallee country ... ... ••• ••• 2,256,734
Lower Murray frontages, partial mallee ... ... 861,/76

16,093,660
In round numbers 10,000,000 acres were alienated j 2,000,000
acres appropriated for commonage ; 27,000,000 acres were under the
occupation or in partial occupation of pastoral tenants ; 16,000,000
acres were unoccupied. It will be seen from the above returns that
the amount of arable land suitable and convenient for cultivation
left unalienated was comparatively small. The best land of the
colony was indeed parted with under the Land Acts of 1860, 1862,
and 1865. The agricultural land available for settlement under the
proposed legislation of 1869, was far removed from the great centres
of population, situated either in treeless and rainless regions, or in
thickly timbered, and impenetrable forests. This circumstance, of
itself would probably have been sufficient to disarm opposition
from the squatting party to the proposed new land law, but when
it was coupled with the proposal to renew the pastoral tenancies
for ten years, it was quite secure from any demonstration of antag-
onism from that quarter.
The principal objections raised against the bill on the second
reading debate were :—(1) By the Liberal members of the House
to the continuation of the squatting system ; and (2) by Conserva-
tive members to the endowment of the Minister of Lands with
arbitrary power. By those members, like Mr. Everard and Mr.
Longmore, who represented the old views of the convention, the
proposed renewal of the squatting tenure was strongly opposed.
They contended that the squatters’ tenure was finally settled by the
Act of 1862, and that after the expiration of that tenure, the pas-
toral tenants of the Crown had no right either legal or equitable
against the community. Further it was urged that the squatters
had cut off all hope of sympathy and support from the people of
Victoria because they had plundered and divided the public inherit-
ance, and outraged every form of law, and order, by their criminal
practices. The opponents of the old squatting system were, how-
ever, divided in opinion as to what should be done with the waste


lands of the Crown if the squatters were driven into the Yarra,
or across the Murray, One section wanted the country thrown
open for free grass, but they were not quite agreed about the details
of the scheme. The leading argument in its favor was that the
industrial classes would not then be embarrassed in their effort to
settle upon the soil; that free selection would have a fair trial, and
that the squatters not being located upon the lands of the colony
with their flocks and herds would have no strong motive for seizing
every available block. Another section advocated the sub-division
of existing runs into small squattages, whilst a third party objected
to this proposal, on the ground that it would multiply impediments
in the way of selection, by creating a numerous and more powerful
body to oppose and resist popular legislation. What would be better
than this, it was argued, would be to sell existing runs by auction
or tender. In this diversity of opinion the squatting interests pre-
vailed. There were at that time about 1040 pastoral tenants. The
revenue derived from pastoral occupation in 1868 was £177,643.
The capabilities of runs for carrying sheep were as follows :—There
were 254 runs which carried less than 1,000 sheep each. There
were 182 runs carrying under 2,000 sheep ; 71 runs carrying under
4,000; 101 runs carrying under 5,000; 120 runs carrying under 7,500
sheep. Altogether there were 824 runs carrying less than 7,500
sheep each. There were 71 runs carrying under 10,000 sheep ; 80
runs carrying under 15,000 ; 40 runs carrying under 20,000 ; two
runs carrying under 30,000 ; three runs carrying under 40,000 ; and
there were two runs carrying under 50,000 sheep. It was estimated
that there were 6,500,000 sheep depastured on these pastoral runs,
and the amount of money invested in the property or represented
by stock was about £3,000,000. “ True,” said Mr. Grant and the
friends of the ministry supporting their Land scheme, “ we may have
a legal right to deal with that interest as we think fit, but as legisla-
tors, as statesmen—as men having all the interests of the colony
under our charge—would it be a wise thing suddenly to put this vast
property in a condition in which it might be exposed to serious
danger 1 If all these runs were let by tender or auction the State
would be a great loser, because the only persons who would bid for
them would be the present occupants. At all events we should not,
in my opinion, be a gainer by the transaction. But, apart from this,
let us consider, as wise men and as statesmen, whether we should
deal ; with that interest suddenly. If we do, we shall produce such a
commercial panic in this country as never has had a parallel in the
southern hemisphere, and probably would never have again.”
With regard to the enlarged discretionary power which the bill
gave the Minister of Lands, objection was taken to this part of the
measure by Mr. Duffy, Mr. Edward Langton and other hon. members,
who assserted that a political head of a department should not be


called upon to exercise judicial functions, and that under the new
system the right of a selector would be placed at the fnercy of a
minister. If this bill became law, it was said, a free selector, after
he has lived three years upon his land, made his improvements—com-
plied with the conditions—-and then desires to purchase the fee simple
instead of being enabled to do so in the ordinary course of law, could
only do so by the personal permission of the President of the Board of
Land and Works. Mr. Higinbotham . vindicated the policy of the
bill. “All our land legislation,” he said, “had failed so far as it had
failed through the competition of wealth against poverty, and fraud
against simplicity.” The Nicholson Land Act was hardly passed
before a number of squatters and capitalists, availing themselves of
the legal machinery provided by the Act for all, succeeded in secur-
ing for their exclusive benefit, and at a cost less than the real value
of the land, a large portion of the territory. The Du fly Land Act
was followed by the same disastrous and melancholy consequences.
The great defect of these acts, in Mr. Higinbotham’s opinion, was
the want of some strong central authority, in whom could be vested
a power not merely to carry out the wishes of the House, but to
give effect to those wishes and sustain them'through all opposition
coming from whatever quarter, and set in operation by whatever
means, legal or illegal. “It is idle,” said the lion member, “to say
that the land legislation can meet and defeat the various contriv-
ances of fraud. Those contrivances are so numerous, and the means
of resisting them, if absolute power be not given, so weak, that—l
care not how carefully your acts are framed—if men are tempted
by strong inducements of avarice, and are provided with legal means
to effect their object, the State will be defrauded, and the poor
man for whom you wish to legislate will be utterly defeated.
Therefore, I avow that while I regard these large powers as an essen-
tial part of this Bill, I am prepared to support the Bill because
it contains these powers, and I should not be prepared to support
any Land Bill which did not contain them.”
Mr. Berry was equally emphatic in his support of this principle
of the bill. “ I would warn hon. members,” said that gentleman,
“who are new in land legislation, who are sincere in their desire to
promote the settlement of the people, and who admit a largo amount
of settlement has taken place by the use of the discretionary
power vested in the Minister of Lands under the existing law, that
every attempt made by the Legislature to tie the hands of the
Minister, to give him no discretionary power, but to insist that he
shall follow the strict letter of the law, has altogether failed. If it
has failed in the past, we have no guarantee that it will not fail in the
future. I believe, however, that not only is their no objection, but
it is desirable to extend the discretionary powers at present vested
in the Minister of Lands provided that they are exercised publicly.


I think that we should constitute the Lands office something more
of a court than it is at present. It will have to deal with questions
of a much larger and more important nature than hitherto. Every
year, as free selection and the settlement of the country progress
numerous questions will arise which can be much better settled in
the Lands office than in the court of law.”
An amendment proposed by Mr. McGregor, member for Rodney,
declaring that the administrative powers proposed to be conferred
by the Bill, arbitrary and excessive, was negatived by a majority of
26, and the second reading was carried. It would be beyond the
scope of this work to follow the fortunes of this measure thiough
committee of the Assembly or to trace its progress in the Upper
House, and in the conference of both Houses until after many
additions and modifications, it became law on 28th December, 1869,
when the Macpherson Ministry was in office. It will be sufficient
for the purpose of this work to give an outline of the framework
of this Act, which was supposed to incorporate and concentrate all
the good results of our previous experience and observation in land
legislation.
Any person not being under 18 years of age, or a married woman
not judicially separated from her husband, could peg out and apply
personally to a land officer for a license to occupy an allotment of
land, before or after survey. The Governor could, if he thought
fit, issue a license to occupy an allotment applied for not exceeding
320 acres in the whole, for a period of three years at 2s. per acre
payable in advance. Every license contained conditions : —I. For
payment of license fees, half-yearly in advance. 2. That the licensee
would not assign, or transfer, or sub-let the allotment during the
currency of the license. 3. That the licensee would, within two
years, enclose the allotment with a fence, and, during the currency
of the license cultivate at least one acre out of every ten. 4. Con-
ditions for re-entry in case of breach of covenant, or in case the
licensee did not occupy the land within six months from the
granting of the license, or in case he did not carry out improve-
ments to the extent of one pound per acre before the end of three
years. 5. A condition that if the licensee occupied, fenced, and
cultivated, and proved to the satisfaction of the Board of Land and
Works that he had complied with the law, he would be entitled,
within 30 days after the expiration of the three years’ license, to
obtain a Oown grant of the allotment on paying 14s per acre, or
otherwise that he might obtain a lease of the allotment for seven
years at 2s. per acre, the rent to go towards the purchase money.
Besides this every license might contain such other conditions and
provisions, not inconsistent with the Act, as the Governor ap-
proved of. Every applicant was required to make an affidavit that
his application was in conformity with the law. 6. Assignment of


an allotment by act of parties or operation of law was utterly in-
operative. No person could select more than one allotment, or allot-
ments, to the extent of 320 acres. Persons whose allotments were
forfeited for evasion of the Act should be unqualified to select
again. Persons who had selected under previous Land Acts the
maximum number of acres allowed by this Act were not entitled
to apply for licenses. No one could apply as agent or trustee of
another. Licenses obtained contrary to law could be forfeited with
all improvements on land so licensed. Contracts made in violation
the Act were void. A licensee, lessee, or assign of an allotment
had all the rights of an owner as against trespassers except the
right of impounding, and that right was acquired as soon as the
land was fenced in. Licensees of land under the 42nd clause of
the Act of 1865, who occupied for two years and a-half, and erected
buildings and other improvements on the land, were entitled, if there
were no objections to the alienation on the ground of its being
auriferous, to have the exclusive right of purchasing the allotment
at a price determined by the Board not exceeding the upset price
of the nearest land sold by the Crown before the issue of the license,
and the rent previously paid by the licensee was credited as part of the
purchase money. The 42nd clause was reproduced with amendment
in section 49 of the new Act —by which it was provided that one
person could not hold more than one license, covering 20 acres. As in
the Act of 1865, the quantity of land that could be sold by auction
in one year was limited to 200,000 acres. The Governor was
authorised to issue yearly pastoral licenses to persons who at the
time of the passing of the Act were in the-licensed occupation of
runs for pastoral purposes. The licensed land, however, was still
available for sale, or for selection, or for proclamation as common-
age, or for occupation under miners’ rights, or business licenses.
The rent in each run was fixed at the rate of Bd. for every sheep
and 4s. for every head of cattle, which it was determined to be
capable of carrying. Unoccupied Crown lands and forfeited runs
could be converted into runs and exposed to auction in areas suf-
ficient to carry 4,000 sheep, or 1,000 head of cattle. General pro-
visions were made for the proclamation of commons and other
reserves, and for the issue of leases of land, for other than agricultural
or pastoral purposes.
From the above analysis it will be noticed that the Act of 1869
differed in the following respects from the law which it succeeded :
1. Introduced free selection before survey ; abolished agricultural
areas ] terminated selection by lot, and gave allotments to first
applicants leaving it to the land-officer or minister to decide in
priority. 2. Reduced the size of selections from 640 to 320 acres.
3. Applied the rent paid during the probationary period of licensed
occupations towards the purchase money. 4. Made the Minister of


Lands for the time being supreme j udge of the performance of
of conditions and covenants. 5. Imposed the conditions of resi-
dence, cultivation, and fencing as absolutely necessary to entitle a
lessee to a lease or Crown grant.
So came into force the great Land Act of 1869. It was supposed
to embody the highest wisdom of the Victorian Legislature derived
from our own memorable experience in land legislation, as well as
from the study of the land systems of other civilized nations. The
debates which took place in connection with the bill displayed a vast
amount of political knowledge on the part of the hon. members; nor
was the bill hurried through Parliament. For nearly eight months
it was under the consideration of the Legislature, of the press,
and of the people of the country. Surely this ought to have given
universal satisfaction 1 As already indicated when the land Act of
1869 was passed the best of the agricultural lands forming the
garden of Victoria was sold, the hulk of it being locked up in large
pastoral properties. The classification of available lands given on
a preceding page shows that the Act,pf 1869 had not the same
ample scope of rich and fertile country upon which to operate that
was open in the experimental period of Victorian land legislation.
This must be borne in mind in any critical examination respecting
the efficiency and success of its principles.
The Act came into force on the Ist February, 18/0. It took
two or three months to get it into working order. Applications for
licenses began to pour into the department in April. Between that
date and December, 1874, 4,501,968 acres were selected. Threeyears
probation being required, the first applications for leases, or Crown
grants were not sent in till April or May, 1873. In 18/0, 320, /19
acres were selected; in 1871, 477,685 acres; in 18/2, 780,819 acres;
in 1873, 1,041,779 acres; in 1874, 1,809,668 acres. In December,
1874, the number of selectors’ leases applied for represented
570,591 acres, and the Crown grants applied for comprised 82,415
acres, making a total of 653,006 acres, which, within four years passed
from the control of the department. From these figures it will be seen
that the provisions of the Act were extensively made use of from the
beginning of its operation, and that there was every prospect of its
popularity continuing. Notwithstanding this in September, 1873,
Mr. J. J. Casey, Minister of Lands of the Francis Government,
brought in a Bill to amend the Act, by increasing the area which
a person might select from 320 to 640 acres, and to alter the
conditions of tenure. The reason alleged for the proposed altera-
tion was that the quality of land then available for selection was
not nearly so rich and convenient as that already alienated ; and
that in order to make farming pay, a selector should be allowed to
take up an increased area, Mr, Higinbotham then took the oppor-
tunity of drawing attention to the alarming rate at which the


public lands were being alienated and the necessity of some radical
reform by which the state would not part with all its territory
for ever. He proposed the following new clauses Whereas it is
expedient, for the purpose of maintaining and increasing the public
revenue, that the State should retain in perpetuity so much at
least of the lands of the Crown in Victoria as shall not be required
either for permanent reservation for a public purpose or for aliena-
tion by license or lease under sub-division 1 of part 2 of the Land
Act, 1869, and this Act, and that the sale by auction of Crown
lands in fee-simple should accordingly be forthwith discontinued,
and that Crown lands should henceforth be sold by auction for a
limited term only, and should from time to time at the end or other
determination of such term, revert with all improvements thereon
to the State : Be it therefore enacted that sections 34 and 35 of
the Land Act, 1869, shall be and the same are hereby repealed, and
the two following sections shall, from and after the passing hereof,
be and be deemed to be the 34th and 35th sections respectively of
the said Act All lands of the Crown in Victoria, wherever
situated may be sold by public auction for any term not exceeding
21 years from the date of .such sale, subject to such covenants, con-
ditions, exceptions, and reservations as the Governor may direct;
providing that all such lands shall be sold at an upset price
of £1 for each acre, or at such higher upset price as the Governor
may direct, exclusive of any rent that may be reserved in respect
thereof. Once at least in every quarter of the year there shall be
holden one or more public sales by auction of lands for a limited
term as in the last section mentioned ; and any person authorised by
the said board may hold such sales without having an auctioneer’s
license or incurring on that account any penalty ; and notice of
every such sale shall be given in the Government Gazette within three
months and before one month thereof, and every such notice shall
declare, with all practical precision, the time and place at which
such auction will be held and the lands to be offered for sale
thereat and the lots in which the same shall be offered, and the
upset price for each lot, and the amount of the deposit required; and
no upset price shall be altered without as full notice of such altera-
tion by advertisement and otherwise being given as was or should
have been given to the original upset price.
A long and important debate took place on these amendments,
but they were ultimately negatived by 9 votes to 44. The Bill,
however, was lost. The Council insisted upon adding certain
amendments, curtailing the power of the Minister of Lands and
giving the right of appeals against the decision to the ordinary courts
of law. The Assembly rejected the new clauses, on the ground that
they would substitute for a responsible minister irresponsible bodies
and place the administration of the land law beyond the control of


Parliament, whilst the right of appeal to a court of law, proposed
to be given in all cases and in all stages would lead to endless
and costly litigation, impose insuperable barriers in the way of
selectors, frustrate the policy of settling the people on the lands,
and coniine the alienation of public lands to the wealthy and pro-
pertied classes.
In June, 1875, the same land Minister brought in another
amending land bill to increase the size of selection to 640 acres, and
lengthening the period of probation from three years to six years,
giving the selector a non-transferrable lease for seven years at the
end of the probationary period; and the providing for the issue of
non-resident licenses within proclaimed districts. In committee on
on the Bill, Mr. F. R. Godfrey, member for West Bourke moved
an amendment in favor of leasing instead of alienating Crown lands,
but it was rejected by a large majority. The Bill was discharged
from the notice paper on the break up of the Francis Adminis-
tration.
The years 1877, and 1878, were periods of great depression
among the farming population, owing to want of rain, and bad
harvests. In consequence of this unfortunate state of affairs,
hundreds of selectors were compelled to mortgage their leases in
order to raise funds. During the year 1877, 1,616 mortgages,
representing 318,797 acres, were registered in the lands depart-
ment. In the first nine months of 1878, 3,018 mortgages were
registered, covering 646,104, acres. In February, 1878, there were
38,800 licensees and lessees of land, and of that number 13,623
were in arears of rent to the amount of £158,066 ; in September,
1878, 41,820 licensees and 15,771 lessees owed £196,462 in rent.
In these times of hardship many selectors found the fencing con-
ditions press very heavily on them, as the cost of a substantial
fence round 320 acres was little less £2OO. Complaints were also
made that they could not under the stringent resident conditions
leave their homestead for short periods to take work and earn a few
pounds to help them onwards. These questions of grave import-
ance were inquired into by a commission, under the presidency of
Mr, W. J. O’Hea, appointed by the Berry Ministry. The commis-
sion found that generally speaking the settlement effected under
the Act of 1869 was bona fide and permanent did not admit of
doubt, but it was doubtful whether it would continue in conse-
quence of the pecuniary embarrassment in which a considerable
number of selectors were involved. The necessity of carrying out
improvements on their land within the time prescribed by law had
plunged them into debt, whilst the prolonged drought had proved
fatal to their crops and stock. The consequence was that many of
them were deeply in debt to the banks, to money-lending agents,
and to storekeepers; and there was much danger that a consider-


able number of these indebted selectors would not be able ulti-
mately to discharge their pecuniary obligations. In that case they
would lose their land, which would thus fall into the hands of their
creditors, and pass from these into the possession of persons who
apply themselves to aggregate extensive areas of land in the form
of large private estates. “In this way,” the Commissioners reported,
“ the wise and beneficent policy of the State, namely, to settle a
numerous yeoman class upon the soil, it is to be feared, will be in a
great measure frustrated, and the State will lose both its property in
the land and the consideration for which that property was parted
with, namely, a settled agricultural population, unless some means be
devised for averting this calamity. The primary cause of this
unfortunate state of things is the very limited capital—sometimes
the absence of capital—with which selectors enter upon their hold-
ings, combined with what is, under such circumstances, the burthen-
some character of the conditions of settlement imposed by the Land
Act.”
The remedies recommended by the commission were that the
conditions of settlement should be so modified as to lighten the
burden of selectors during the most onerous years of their oc-
cupancy. This could be best done by extending the preliminary
period of license from three to six years, during which the improve-
ments could be made and by reducing the payments to the Govern-
ment on account of purchase from 2s. per year to Is. per year. In
that case the selector would be 20 years in possession—six years
by license and 14 years by lease—before he got a Crown grant.
These recommendations formed the ground work of the amending
Act of 1878, brought in by Mr. Longmore, Land Minister of the
Berry Government. In addition to giving effect to the scheme as
proposed by the commission of lengthening the term of occupancy
preliminary to the issue of the Crown grant and reducing the
annual payments to Is. per acre per year, the amending Act allowed
a licensee on giving personal notice to a land officer to absent him-
self from his allotment during three months of a year. Selectors
under the Act of 1869 whose license had been issued within three
years from the commencement of the amending Act, were enabled
to surrender their old licenses and obtain new licenses under the
relieving Act. On the surrender of the old license every year of
occupation under it was allowed to count as two years in the com-
putation of time for which the new license would have to be issued.
Licensees of residence sites under the 49th section of the Act of
1869 also received some concessions. On proof of occupation
during a continuous period of three years and on payment of all fees
due, they were entitled to demand and obtain a Crown grant of the
site, provided it were not auriferous, of required for mining or public
purposes, or not situated within any city, town, or borough. Power


was given to issue “non-residence licenses.” The terms of these
were that the licensee paid 2s. per acre towards the purchase money
for six years; that he improved the allotment to the extent of £1
per acre during the first three years of the currency of the license;
that, before the end of the sixth year of the currency of the license
an additional £l per acre should be spent in improvements; that the
entire sum payable in respect of the purchase money should be £2 per
acre, and that residence or occupation was not necessary. This Act
and the Act of 1869 are at present in force in Yictoria, but a Bill to
supersede them, brought in by Mr. Walter Madden, Minister of Lands
of the o‘Loghlen Government, is now before the Legislative Assembly.
From Ist February, 1870, to December 1881, 8,700,866 acres were
selected, and 949,181 acres were sold by auction, making a total of
9,560,077, acres alienated under the Acts now in operation.


CHAPTER YL
RESULTS OF VICTORIAN LAND LEGISLATION.
A general review of the operation and results of Land Legislation
in Victoria will be of some service in drawing attention to salient
points which require a separate conspectus in a complicated narra-
tive of events extending over fifty years of memorable history. The
land question has been the great battle ground of parties in Vic-
toria ever since the foundation of the colony, and will continue to
be so for all time. In this country, as in others, it is the one grand
and enduring political problem which periodically reappears and
asserts its importance. Superficial politicians occasionally express
the wish that the whole difficulty were settled by the sale of the last
acre. Those who think the question will be laid to rest for ever in
the colony of Victoria by the sale of the last acre must have either
not studied the history of the human race at all or studied. its
lessons in vain. The history of revolutions has been the history of
land tenure.
The sale of Victorian soil began under Imperial Land Acts which
continued in force until the colony secured responsible Govern-
ment. The system established by that legislation was sale of land
in fee simple by auction at an upset price, beginning at ss. per acre,
then advancing to 12s. per acre, ultimately the minimum upset
price being established at £1 per acre. One half of the proceeds
of the sale of land was devoted to assisted emigration, and the
balance was applied to public works. Assisted emigration was
adopted as a counter-poise to the inducements offered by the sale of
land at a cheaper rate in Canada and the United States. The result
was to draw to these shores the out-pouring of British workhouses,
multitudes of the poor, the needy, and the destitute, who became a
burden and a curse to the struggling young community and the
servile dependents of those who acquired land by free gift or at
cheap rates. Hundreds of enterprising emigrants who came here
to seek their fortunes, and well able to become good colonists, were
compelled to leave because of the difficulties thrown in the way of


settlement, by cliques of monopolists aided and abetted by corrupt
and incapable Government officials. The squatters were in posses-
sion of nearly the whole of the territory. It was their interest to
discourage settlement, and they succeeded in doing so, until the dis-
covery of gold. Then came the social revolution. Thousands of
able and sagacious emigrants arrived in Victoria, and the cry
“ unlock the land” was raised in tones too emphatic to be resisted.
After a long struggle the Nicholson Land Act was passed in 1860.
At that time 3,944,237 acres of the pick of Victorian soil had been
sold by auction. The system of sale by auction, as it then existed,
was an easy method of handing over vast blocks of land to wealthy
buyers, against whom small and struggling adventurers had no
chance. A loud outcry was raised against it, and free selection at
an uniform price with deferred payments was demanded by a land-
less population. The Nicholson Land Act pretended to give this
so called liberal land law, but it was a delusion and a snare. It
allowed a man to take up 640 acres at £1 per acre, and if he could
not pay the whole of the purchase money at once, he could lease a
moiety of the allotment for pastoral purposes only, at Is. per acre
per annum. If more than one person applied for the same allot-
ment it was sold by auction, at which only applicants could compete.
This was called “ limited auction.” It did not favor settlement more
than sale by auction in open market, because bona fide applicants
were out-numbered and out-bidden by capitalists. The size of the
allotments open to selection made the squatters more eager to absorb
and save their runs. Capital was overwhelming, and destroyed the
o-ood intentions of the framers of the Act. Some slight settlement,
however, took place under an obscure clause, which gave the Land
minister power to issue occupation licenses. These licenses pre-
sented a most satisfactory solution of the land question but they
were declared illegal by the Supreme Court. The break-down of
the Nicholson Act led to the passage of the Duffy Act, which
to squatters nine years licenses, and introduced a system
of determining priority of selection by lot; fixed the size of al-
lotments at 640 acres ; prescribed certain improvements to be
carried out; gave the selector the option of paying the whole of
the purchase money at once, or purchasing a moiety, and leasing a
moiety for 8 years, at a rent of 2s. 6d. per acre, the rent to go to-
wards the purchase money. No person could select more than one
allotment of 640 acres in one year. This Act marked the inaugura-
tion of dummyism in its most repulsive form. It collapsed igno-
miniously after about 1,000,000 acres of good land had filtered
through it into the hands of large landed proprietors. It failed to
effect substantial settlement, and facilitated dummyism, because it
did not enforce personal application ; because personal residence was
not required as a test of bona fides ; because the condition of im-


provement did not run with the land, hut was personal to the
selector, and worst of all because the selector could transfer the
land as soon as he took it up. Next came the Land Act of 1865.
Its fundamental principles were that allotments of 640 acres could
be leased for seven years at a rent of 2s. per acre; the order of appli-
cation to be determined by lot; conditions —rent to be paid half-
yearly in advance ; non-assignment for three years, residence for
three years, and improvements, to the extent of £1 per acre,
within two years. On fulfilling the conditions of residence and
improvement the selector could buy the allotment without com-
petition at £1 per acre. At the end of three years, if the selector
had improved the land to the extent of £1 per acre, he could have
the land sold by auction with a valuation in his favor. Even by
this Act residence was not made an inexorably necessary condi-
tion precedent. The extensive power of sale by auction of un-
selected and forfeited allotments, dummy ism, and evasion of covenants
helped to swell the large estates, and defeat the policy of the
Legislature, whilst the necessity of improvements within a short
period, the payment of high rent, which did not go towards the
purchase money, and the obligation to pay the purchase money in a
lump sum, pressed heavily on selectors. The only part of this
Act which operated with undoubtedly successful results was the
42nd clause, founded on the model of the occupation licenses. The
Land Act of 1869 embodied the leading principle of the occupation
licensing, and 42nd clause system. It reduced the area of selections
to 320 acres; required residence upon the allotment; cultivation
of one acre in ten; fencing and improvements to the extent of
£1 per acre during a probationary period of occupation under
license at 2s. per acre, which went towards the purchase money ;
and if at the end of that term the licensee occupied, fenced, cul-
tivated and improved, as required, to the satisfaction of the Minis-
ter, he could either get a crown grant on payment of the remaining
14s. per acre or take a lease for seven years at 2s. per acre, the
rent to go towards the purchase money. No person could select
either in his own name, or in the name of any other person, more
than 320 acres. The squatters’ licenses were renewed for ten
years. By the Amending Act of 1878 the probationary period
was extended to six years, the term of lease to fourteen years, and
the rent was reduced to Is. per acre, thus payable over 20 years.

The settlement of the land question in Victoria was from the
earliest times, clogged and embarrassed by several adverse cir-
cumstances, principal among which were the squatting interests,
the limited extent of our territory, the want of rivers and of an
abundant water supply. The squatting interest alone was a for-
midable obstacle. But for that, Victoria might have had, in
1860, the Land Law of 1878, and with such a system, defective as
it is, the history of the colony would have been veiy different from
what it has been. In 1878 the squatting party was almost a party
of the past, and a liberal Land Law in favor of settlement and
against the aggregation of large estates became possible. The
squatters no longer were driven by motives of avarice or self-pre-
servation, to grasp every available inch of public territory. By that
time the earth hunger was nearly satisfied; most of the good land
previously held on license was turned into freehold ; the selectors
were driven to the burning plains of the North West, and the im-
penetrable wilderness of Gippsland. What then has been the real
practical out-come of twenty years bitter experience—twenty years
struggle to place a prosperous agricultural population upon the soil


Unhappily, it must be admitted that the able legislation of 1869,
improved by that of 1878, came too late to promote in a substantial
manner the lasting welfare of the colony. Let us first see what
has been done, and contrast it with what might have been done.
From the year 1851, just before the discovery of the gold-
fields to end of the first half of the year 1864, when our population
was 601,343, Victoria had spent the sum of £11,000,000_ in the
importation of bread-stuffs. At that time there were 17,679 agri-
cultural holdings, exceeding one acre in extent, covering 5,554,531
acres sold and in actual occupation for agricultural and pastoral
purposes, of which 507,798 acres were cultivated. In the year
1880-1 when our population was 858,850, the value of exports of
Victorian produced bread-stuffs, viz., biscuits, flour, and gram was
£905,403 ; in that year the number of agricultural holdings ex-
ceeding one acre in extent were 49,637 covering 18,141,114 acres
sold and in actual occupation for agricultural and pastoral pur-
poses, of which 1,997,943 acres were cultivated, and 194,140 acres
were in fallow. The cultivated area included land applied to the
growth of all kinds of crop—wheat, oats, barley, maize, potatoes,
turnips, onions, beet, carrots, cabbages, hay, green-forage, tobacco,
vines and other fruit trees. The value of grain and pulse exported
in 1875, was £7,623, and in 1881, £668,234 ; flour exported 1875,
£15,011, 1881, £206,932. These figures are significant as showing
the great increase in agricultural production which took place sub-
sequent to the land legislation of 1869.
Although there has thus been a very substantial and prosperous
increase in the agricultural productions of the colony, the results
are by no means so satisfactory as might have been expected. Un-
doubtedly, a great amount of profitable settlement took place under
the Act of 1869, notwithstanding the inferiority of the land avail-
able compared with that sold under previous Acts. This suggests
what might have happened had the same class of industrious
farmers been able to obtain land at an earlier period. Still, of the
nine or ten million acres disposed of, or in course of alienation, by
virtue of the provisions of the law now in force, it is to be feared
that large numbers of holdings are passing away from their original
holders. The evidence which justifies this apprehension is to be
found in the official statistics of the colony. According to the
Government Statist, Mr. Hay ter, there were in 1870, when the
Land Act of 1869 came into force, 31,842 agricultural holdings,
exceeding one acre in extent, and including 9,530,638 acies ; in
1881, the number of holdings had increased to 49,637, covering
18,141,124 acres, showing an increase of only 17,795 holdings.
But the departmental statistics show that during the period be-
tween 1870 and 1881, 70,371 selections were granted. It thus
appears that fully 50,000 of these selections, are not accounted for


in the official returns; what became of them ? The number of hold-
ings has not increased proportionately with the number of selec-
tions granted, and the number of acres selected. The calculation
may be carried backward with still more disquieting] results.
The total number of selections taken up under the three Acts of
1800, 1862 and 1865, was 39,631, embracing an area of 4,679,251
acres. This number added to that of the applications for allot-
ments, granted under the Act of 1869, should have made the total
number of agricultural holdings in the colony, in the year 1881,
about 109,631. Instead of that, according to Mr. Hayter, there
are only 49,637 agricultural holdings of over one acre in size. The
Lands department has no record of transfers under the Acts of 1860,
1862 and 1865, with the exception of holdings under the 42nd
section of the last mentioned Act. There could, however, be no
legal assignments, or transfers of leaseholds, under the Act of 1869,
without the consent of the Minister of Lands. The number of
transfers of leaseholds, registered up to the 30th September, 1882,
was 9,932, embracing 1,673,561 acres ; up to the same time, 3,396
Crown grants were transferred, including 374,482 acres. This
makes a total of 2,048,043 acres selected under the Land Act of
1869, which are actually registered as having passed from the
original holders. The rest of the unaccounted for holdings, must
have been either abandoned or forfeited, or transferred to large
landed proprietors, subsequent to the issue of the Crown grants.
Of the rapid increase of large estates in Victoria, owing to the
unscrupulous abuse of liberal land laws, there is an abundance of
evidence. There are 951 estates of the average size of 7,238 acres.
These estates which include 6,882,815 acres, are owned by 833
proprietors, whilst their total capital value is about £12,000,000.
Another item of testimony that the aggregation of estates has
been increasing more rapidly than the number of holdings, is the
fact that in 1860, when the first land Act was passed, there were
13,653 holdings, covering acres, in agricultural and
pastoral occupation, whilst in 1880, there were 49,637 holders, and
the number of acres in agricultural and pastoral occupation was,
18,141,124; during that period, therefore the number of holdings
was considerably diminished in proportion to the number of acres
sold.
We are now in a position fo notice the defective character of
our land systems, and the various insidious influences which ope-
rated against bona fide cultivation of the soil. It is impossible
to avoid the conclusion that the dream of the Land Convention has
not been realized. The very laws which were designed to establish
an extensive peasant propriety in Victoria have assisted to con-
solidate gigantic properties. Free selection at an uniform price, with
deferred payments, has been resorted to more freely and more effect-


ually by capitalists than by the artisans and working men of the
colony. The state has sold nearly 20,000,000 acres, and instead of
the country being crowded with farms and orchards, it can only
boast of a cultivated area of 1,997,943 acres. Capital has been
triumphant everywhere. It was successful under the limited auc-
tion system of the Nicholson Land Act; and it was still more suc-
cessful, with dummyism as a potent ally, under the lot system of
the Duffy Land Act. After that, a new and unforeseen danger
appeared on the scene. The people, in whose favor Parliament
legislated became traitors to their own cause. The demoralization
and immorality of the land racket became universally contagious.
Thousands of persons with little energy and limited resources took
up land on speculation, and afterwards sold out to those who were
only too eager to buy. The high price of land, caused by the great
demand for it, facilitated this species of speculation, and men who
got their land from the state at £1 per acre, readily bartered it
away at a profit, after formal compliance with the require-
ments of the law. Selectors, the class intended to be benefitted,
and upon whom was conferred the bountiful liberality of the nation,
sold for a mess of pottage the birthright which belonged to them
and their children. The prodigality of the state in parting so ex
travagantly and incautiously with the common inheritance of all,
has been only surpassed by the profligacy and the ingratitude of those
who were the objects of the paternal care and anxiety of Par-
liament.
These statements can be proved, not only by the evidence of
friends of the free-selection system, but by that of those organs -of
the press whose proclaimed policy for many years has been to favor
free-trade in land. The Argus of 11th November, 1881, thus de-
scribes the results of our land legislation :—“ But we know that the
attempt to create a yeomanry on a large scale has only been par-
tially successful. Selectors struggle on until they can get a title,
and then in too many instances their holdings, which they have
been granted on easy terms, in the hope they would be attached
to the soil, go to swell the estates of the large land owners. Then
with a sum of money in their pockets, which they have acquired in
a great measure at the expense of the general body of the Victorian
taxpayers, they take their departure for the neighbouring provinces,
where the capital with which we have furnished them can com
mand greater advantages.” The Sydney Morning Herald of 24th
February, 1882, gave the following testimony that Victorian selec-
tors were selling out and settling in New South Wales with
money realized by the sale of Victorian land :—“ All those men
who transferred their holdings in Victoria had no chance to select
again. The law prohibited such a process. It was necessary for
them to seek another colony, and the great majority were drawn


across the Murray by the superior inducements of the land
and land law of New South Wales. Immigrants to Victoria,
having in Victoria acquired capital by selling out, came to us with
their earnings and their energies and their experience as land specu-
lators. Five years ago we felt their influence in a new flush of
prosperity, especially in our south-western district. While Vic-
toria was mourning their departure, our land and customs and
railway returns were rapidly increasing ; our free and comparatively
illimitable land reserves were acting as a sponge, and we were be-
coming moist at our neighbours’ expense. To some extent, the
same conditions still exist. They might be perfectly satisfactory
if only the present were to be considered ; but it must be re-
cognised that surely as Victoria has met her reckoning day so are we
advancing on ours. Land monopoly is not unknown in New South
Wales. Dummy ism is a very familiar word in our vernacular ; the
process begun across the border is continued here ; land is going
for a fraction of its value to incorporated companies and non-re-
sident landlords. The lesser matters of continuous strife between
selector and squatter, and consequent'waste of energy, might be
forgotten could it be shown that we have in any degree learned
the lesson Victorian history teaches, or that our selectors were as
a body honest home-makers and tillers of the soil, and not merely
birds of passage and transferrors.” The reckoning day of Vic-
toria has arrived. The land laws of the past have been examined,
and reason enlightened by a sad experience has found them wanting.
A careful study of the history of Victoria leads me to the con-
clusion that the unfavorable results, which all deplore, and the
transparent vices, which all detest, are inherently associated with
the principle of absolute sale, on which all those laws were based,
It has been found that dummyism was less rampant, and speculative
selection less resorted to, the more the control of the state over its
land was increased, and the longer the period of probation was
extended. Much more, then, would those evils have been mitigated
and destroyed, had the state retained an inalienable control over
the land that belonged to it. The more one reflects on the question
the more does the conclusion appear inevitable, that the policy of
alienating the land, in fee simple, has been not only a fearful mis-
take, but a crime and an injustice, to a large portion of the people
of the colony. “ What right ” Mr. Darker asked on 30th Sep-
tember, 1873, (a) “had we, as legislators, to alienate any part of
that which belonged to the whole community for the benefit of a
small portion of the community T The right to the use of the
earth, subject to co-ordinate right of others, is as Mr. Herbert
Spencer demonstrates, as much a natural and inalienable right as
the right to the free use of the atmosphere and the sea. True, it
(a) Hansard, vol. 17, p. 1674.


was the policy of the country to settle an agricultural population
upon the soil, but effect could have been given to that policy
without sacrificing the public territory, without giving away the
land for ever, unrepresented by any adequate consideration. The
land could have been leased or sold for farms ; the state would
then have had the reversion. Virtually, the free selectors and
those squatters who availed themselves of free selection, through
the agency of dummies, have been buying the land for nothing.
The allotments which, under the Act of 1862, were paid for in
instalments of 2s. 6d. per acre per annum were worth that much
in rent for all time, and now, more extravagant still, a selector is
permitted to acquire his absolute freehold in 20 years by paying
Is. per acre per annum. Even this sacrifice would hardly be be-
grudged, if the persons intended to be benefitted were not guilty of
wholesale embezzlement of the estates entrusted to them.
The advantages of a judicious system of leasing the public lands
would have been very great. The state would have retained the
national domain as a lasting and un-assailable, unpledgable asset,
which would have gone on increasing in value from year to year.
Instead of a few individuals being enriched by the gradual increase
of the value of land, the whole community woidd have been bene-
fitted. The rent of land would have been a permanent source of
revenue. The vast sum of money sunk in the purchase of free-
holds would have been available for the employment of labor, and
the improvement of waste lands. The state would have remained
landlord of the soil, and could have applied every acre of it to the
best purposes, compatible with national interest and national pros-
perity. The wealthy lower orders would not then have been able
to plunder the working classes of their birthright, by the despicable
aid of fraud, perjury and subornation of perjury. There would not
then have been periodical confiscations and sales of commonages;
and the abolition of reserves for travelling stocks, followed by their
absorption into neighbouring squattages. Under such a system
the people would still have left for their use and enjoyment the
frontages of the few creeks and rivers that exist in Victoria.
Mountain scenery, the charm and gift of nature, such as Macedon
and the Hanging Rock, would not then have become private pro-
perty, so that the owners thereof could warn oft’ tourists and ex-
cursionists, or charge for permission to view the wonders of creation.
What a monstrous and barbaric law must that be, under which the
splendid land between Melbourne and Sunbury, and between Mel-
bourne and Geelong, capable of giving homes and existence to a
teeming population, is locked up in pastoral solitudes, whilst the
farmers have to seek a precarious livelihood in the hot and rainless
regions of the north-western plains! Would it not have been better
to grow sheep in the remote parts of the colony, and encourage


agriculture near the sea hoard, and adjacent to large centres of
population 1 It is impossible to contemplate such enormities and
anomalies as these, without agreeing with Mr Higinbotham “ that
the dictum of the French writer, that property is robbery is abso-
lutely true in regard to land ” (a).
The stereotyped reply to any argument, that Parliament should
stop the furthersale of land is, that the land is nearly all sold already;
that it is now too late to change the system, and that it is best to
settle the question once and for ever, by selling the balance of
the land. There are 32,000,000 acres at present unappropriated,
of which it is said that 9,000,000 acres are lit for selection. Surely
the destiny of such a large quantity of land as this, is a subject well
worthy of the anxious attention of the tax-payers of this country.
It must be remembered that when the last acre is gone, the land
problem will by no means be then settled ; it will then merely enter
upon a new phase, and in that form it will be handed down to coming
generations. The landless portion of the population will, in the
distant future, begin to enquire here, as they are now enquiring in
England, Ireland and Scotland, by what title those in possession of
laud, obtained that possession. Unless the sale of land be suspended,
and the further integration of large estates be prevented, either by
taxation, or by a law prohibiting the ownership or transmission of
land beyond a limited area and value, the time will sooner or later
come when the working classes of Victoria will awake to an un-
pleasant sense of their perilous situation. It is a notorious fact,
proved by the history of the world, that oppression and poverty
accompany the concentration of wealth and the amassing of grand
properties in the hands of monopolists. Landlordism is the curse
and ruin of every country in which it becomes predominant. The
owner of land can dictate terms to his tenantry, and evict them if
they refuse to accept those terms ; they must have land or starve.
This is the cause of anarchy and murder in Ireland. The land-
lords of Scotland have expelled their tenant peasantry from their
ancient glens in the Highlands, and the homes and haunts of
human beings have been converted into sheep runs and deer forests.
The pauperism, misery, drunkeness and crime, which abounds in
England, is traceable to the despotism of land monopoly, and the
appropriation by landlords of land, which in former times belonged
to the labouring classes. No political truth is so grim and startling
in the uniformity with which it appears from age to age as this—
that landlordism and tenancy are ever associated with the pau-
perism and degradation of an entire population. And this is the
condition towards which our free and glorious colony of Victoria
will drift, unless its advance in that direction be arrested, by the
courage and wisdom of her statesmen, assisted by the patriotism
(a) Hansard, vol. 17, p. 2050.


and foresight of her inhabitants. Let it not then be said, that it
is too late to save the remainder, or a portion of the public estate.
It may be premature to discuss the question of resumption, except
to a limited degree, and in special cases, but stern and determined
steps should be adopted to suspend the present process of legalized
robbery and confiscation of the land of the whole people.
From a revenue point of view the pastoral occupation of the soil
has been proportionately more profitable to the State than the sale
of lands in fee simple. This seems a startling assertion, and yet it
is an unquestionable truth. The revenue derived from the pas-
toral tenants of the Crown from the year 1840, to the end of the year
1881, amounted to £4,850,165. The revenue derived from the ab-
solute sale of Crown Lands from the year 1830 to the end of the
year 1881, was £20,192,791. This sum includes the amount paid
on lands purchased on deferred payments, of which the payments
were completed up to the year 1881, although the payments ex-
tended over a series of years. The area selected of which the pur-
chase was not completed in 1881, amounted to 7,144,362 acres.
Deducting 7,145,362 from 19,819,739 the number of acres sold,
selected and in course of alienation, it appears that 12,674,377 acres
have been sold out-right, yielding £20,192,791. The land sold, and
the upset value of selected land in course of alienation by deferred
payment represents a total of £27,338,153 as the results of 45 years
land sales, against £4,850,165 realized for the use of public grass
during a period of 41 years. In round numbers twenty million
acres has been parted with for ever for twenty seven million sterling;
whilst the grass alone of forty million acres produced during the
progress of alienation nearly five million sterling. If we sell our
remaining acres what will be done when the land revenue is ab-
sorbed 1 What inducement to immigration shall we have hereafter
to offer to the people of the old world 1 And what security for
new loans shall we be able to offer to the money-lenders of London?
The land policy of the future should therefore be one strictly of
conservation. Nothing will be lost, and we have everything to
gain by preserving the state domain from the further grasp of land
sharks, and dummy-mongers. Selection of country lands should be
stopped for the present, and leases for long terms at easy rents
with a valuation of improvements in favor of the occupying tenant
substituted. Town lands should be let on long building leases.
As a compromise to this sweeping abolition of old usages, and old
expressions, the free-hold of town lands might be sold for terms
ranging from 20 to 30 years, full compensation for improve-
ments being secured. And with regard to country lands the state
might give intending settlers the option of selecting or leasing, re-
serving to itself the right of pre-emption. Meanwhile every reserve,
common and river frontage should be religiously protected, and per-


manently secured for the lasting use of the people. Steps should
also be taken to resume possession of some of the frontages to rivers,
which were extensively, and greedily bought up in former years by
the squatters for the purpose of making the back country useless
for selection by cutting it off from access to water. In justice to
the State this extraordinary device to secure the monopoly of vast
areas of land at a nominal rent should be defeated. The law which
enables the Government to take possession at a stipulated price of
private land for the construction of railways or high roads should
be brought into operation here. Reserves of ten chains wide and
about two miles apart, leading from the back country down to the
river, should be taken possession of by the Goverment at a fair
price, and opened up as roadways through those river-side private
lands, to enable the stock travelling from the back country to have
access to the river. The improved value and enlarged settlement
of the back country resulting from this step, would more than com-
pensate tenfold the cost of the private land resumed, whilst the
right of the State to deal with its own lands without being liable
to be checkmated by the overreaching schemes of individuals would
be vindicated (a).
