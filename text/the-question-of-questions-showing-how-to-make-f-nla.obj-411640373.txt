Tub Author having been repeatedly reminded by his friends and acquaintance*
of his intended Poetical Work, which was defeated by the sudden deser-
tion of every Printing-office in Melbourne, on the Gold discovery at
Ballaarat, in 1851; is induced to renew his former announcement, of
THE AUSTRAL-ASIAN MUSE ;
In two Yols, Royal Bvo.
In the hope that Literary and Mental Productions, may not be wholly ex-
cluded from that support, which it is so universally admitted by the Australian
Public, and advocated by the Press, to be true patriotism of Colonists to af-
ford to the cultivation of Wheat and Wool, and of all other physical products
of “ the Land we live in Mr. Kentish—in accordance with the suggestion
of friends—is induced to submit to his Fellow-Colonists, the unpretending ef-
fusions of his Muse ; trusting that —however humble her merits—amongst his
literary acquaintances, and the educated and higher classes in general, of New
South "Wales (where, as an Editor he had the pleasure to cater for the greatest
number of subscribers, including almost every Magistrate in that Colony some
years ago), South Australia, Swan River, Van Diemen’s Land, New Zealand,
and especially Victoria, sufficient encouragement may not be wanting to sup-
port him in the publication of a perfectly Colonial Work, the whole having been
‘perpetrated’ in, and no sva&W portion being descriptive of, these several Co-
lonies respectively.
The first Volume will probably contain upwards of 300 pages of Miscellaneous Poetry, by
the “ From grave to gay—from lively ,to_ severe,”— comprising-^
AUSTRALIA—In three Cantos ; written in New South Wales.
NEW ZEALAND--By a Shipwrecked Traveller ; written in Cook’s Straits.
TASMANIA—Written principally during a Three Years’ Exploring Expedition in Van
Diemen’s Land.
VICTORIA—A Peep at the splendid Pastoral Province of Port Phillip ; written on the
Murray, in 1818.
THE BUSH IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA—A desultory Poem, in five Cantos ; written at Yan-
kalilla ; in one of which, is included a “ Colonial Opera,” containing sixteen Songc
and a Glee, (to be set to Music and sung by the privileged purchaser, 1 au plaisir.’)
LINES (350) on the Explorers of Australia and Tasmania.
RELIGION, an Ode ; PASTORAL HYMN and RELIGIOUS MISCELLANY.
CHRISTIAN FORTITUDE—In two Books.
fa*
THE REFORMATION—In several Books.

who perished in the Exploration of Northern Australia.
Numerous BIRTH-DAY ODES, SONNETS, and FUGITIVE PIECES, SONGS, FRIVOLITIES,

The second Volume (of at least 500'pages), wilt consist of a Compilation of the “ Gem*
op Australian Poesy,” extracted with great pains from the various Newspapers and
Magazines of each of the Austral Colonies, from their first settlemen to the present
date—enriched by hitherto unpublished compositions of merit, from the pens of Co-
lonial Literati—(which, if composed in Australia , will be entitled to a preference over
productions of the Muse, however excellent, warbled elsewhere): the object of the
Editor being, to bring into one focus—to centralise as it were, and give a “ local
habitation and a name,” to as large a number as practicable, of the really merito-
rious Odes , Sonnets , and Songs , Religious and pathetic pieces — humorous and satirical
effusions —and even Poems of considerable length as well as force, of Australian
Poets, and to rescue from oblivion the harmonious breathings of sundry Bards and
Ladyes-faire , whose melodies have hitherto comparatively , been in Australia
“ Like many a flower that blows to blush unseen,
And waste its fragrance on the desert air.”

PKEFACE.
The date of this, the last printed page of this Book, in its passage through the Press, viz., the
20th of August, shows that two months have been added to the three months which the manu-
script was detained in the Argus office.
During this period, and especially’ within the last fortnight, the subject matter of this
Publication, viz., “a radical Reform of the Regulations for the alienation of Crown Lands,”
has been brought prominently before the Public, at the monster Meeting at Astley’s Amphi-
theatre, on the 10th instant, and by the reception of the Deputation from that Meeting by His
Excellency Sir Charles Hotham ; which proceedings generally, have been promulgated by the
three Daily Newspapers: but as one circumstance of material importance in its bearing on
tins “ Question of Questions,” has been passed over wholly unnoticetfby the Reporters for the
Press—the Author feels it to be a duty to himself, and to the great majority of his fellow-
colonists, who are thoroughly loyal subjects , and not only attached to our gracious Queen, but
to the British Throne, and to our Mother Country, and as desirous of continuing, as a certain
self-constituted body, calling itself the “ People's League,” is agitating to snap asunder, that
connection —to put that circumstance on record, as part and parcel of this Pamphlet.
As Whigs and Tories have frequently united tor some great purpose, not incompatible with
the political principles of either for instance, “ to promote the Abolition of Capital Punish-
ment” —so, it is obvious, may Democrats and Republicans, as well as sound Church-and-State
men (being alike sensible of the advantage to the Colonists of bringing the Land into cultiva-
tion), conjointly petition tire Legislature “ to alienate the Crown Lands on that condition only.
Now it does unfortunately happen that this great and glorious movement, for really “ Unlocking
the Lands,” was originated at the same house where this Constitution-mongering clique has
held its meetings, viz., the “National Hotel,” and that the Landlord and some other persons,
who have been the chief concocters of what they are pleased to call “The People’s League,"
have also taken a prominent part in this “ Land Leagueand further, that the Theatre itself,
which has been gratuitously lent to the Public for the purpose of holding their Meetings on the
Land Question, is, as well as the National Hotel, in the hands of Mr. Mooney as Lessee. It is
therefore much less surprising, than it is gratifying to the “ People’s League” men, and dis-
gusting to the majority of the Committee delegated by the monster Land Meeting to carry out
their intentions; to find that these tico very distinct and widely different Leagues, are by too
many understood as identical.
It needed no Wizard, to assure the Author of this Publication, that such would inevitably be
the case; and it is no slight satisfaction to him, that lie actually pointed this out publicly, and
protested against the artful dodge, at the right moment, viz., at the monster Meeting assembled
in the Theatre to receive the Delegates’ report of their interview with His Excellency the
Governor; when, as will be in the recollection of the two or three thousand persons then present,
in consequence of an attempt made by the very person known as Secretary to the “ People's
League ,” to thrust into the Second Resolution, appointing the Delegates who had waited on
His Excellency, of whom he, the Author, had the honour to be one, in conjunction with some
other names [of persons pitchforked into a body (which was not consulted!) in the most
irregular, and some think unjustifiable, as well as unprecedented manner—to the exclusion, also,
of Gentlemen of honour, influence, and status in society, who had by their zeal and ability as
energetic leaders in the movement, become entitled to public confidence and acknowledgment
of sendees] a Committee to press their Petition for altering the Land Regulations on the new
Legislature—after it had been moved, seconded, and passed—some words to the extraordinary
effect, “ that such Committee [ including in it sundry “ People's League ” agitators /] should watch


over the Public interest {generally), and adopt whatever measures might [ i . e., in-fheir estimation /]
be calculated to promote the same!!! ” The Author of this Pamphlet emphatically implored the
Meeting, which unmistakeahly rejected the insidious proposition intended to be forced on them,
to define more precisely, and especially to limit “ the duty of their Committee,” strictly to their
legitimate object, viz., the support of the same Petition to the Legislature, which they had just
presented to the Governor ; which limits to their functions were, as he stated, the more neces-
sary, in consequence of certain Members of the Committee holding extreme political opinions in
connection with a movement of a very different kind, having for its object severance from Eng-
land —known as the “ People's League.” The soundness of this suggestion is already beginning
to be felt and acknowledged pretty generally!
The Author has nothing whatever to do with, and disclaims any knowledge whatever of,
the sentiments religious (or irreligious) or political, of the Gentlemen associated with him in
this great and holy object of the Committee, which has adopted the title of the “ Land League ,”
with some of whom he deems it an honour and a privilege, as well as pleasure, to co-operate for
the attainment of a measure of just, wise, and liberal policy, calculated beyond any other
human means, to benefit our adopted country—to confer wealth on the industrious and deserv-
ing cultivators of the soil —to give healthful employment to thousands—to create a substantial
yeomanry, and honest and contented peasantry, to become “ Victoria’s pride”—and to enable
the worthy struggling Immigrants from the mother country, to realize those hopes of “ pro-
sperity, on Farms of their own” which induced them to come round the World in search of
Land; and to enable our Citizens and Towns-folk, and Gold-diggers also, to obtain all the
productions of the earth, and most of the comforts of life, plentiful and cheap.
Recognizing the sound maxim, “ better late than never ” —happy indeed will the Author be,
as a lover of the land of his adoption, to see Carried out in 1855, the very object which he has
advocated, even from the first sales of Crown land in Australia, in 1831. It cannot, therefore,
be surprising that he, the Colonist who, of all other persons in Australia, has the longest and
most strenuously contended for the change now so clamorously demanded by the public,
should —being at liberty to do so, at this time—become a willing and gratified participator in the
movement, which, he confidently anticipates, will soon be triumphantly successful; for this
Publication—which is admitted, by persons of all parties , to be a fair exposition of their senti-
ments on u the Question of Questions” —being so remarkably opportune; it would he strange
indeed, and inconsistent, to shrink from an effort, which has almost become a duty, at the very
time that the object is about fo be realized, by a sort of coup de main ; and it is well known that
the Author is not deficient of courage, either moral or physical, to do his duty.
The events of the last few weeks, render it incumbent on the Author, to enunciate in tire
most unequivocal terms, that he is no less desirous to repudiate any connection whatever with
an association of the most objectionable kind—which he deems seditious, and of course, if so,
illegal—viz. that of a knot of brawlers, consisting, in no small degree, of Ignorant demagogues,
presuming to form a “ neic Constitution!” than he is willing and anxious to render his best
services, in every legitimate manner, as a loyal subject (much more of a Tory than Democrat!)
in support of the one object of the Land League, which is identical with that advocated,
however feebly, in this Book; the gist of which, is expressed in pp. 15, 16.
The “old hands,” and the Author’s friends and acquaintances in all the Colonies, and all fair
and candid readers who approve his sentiments, are respectfully requested to circulate this
copy, for perusal, amongst the intellectual and thinking classes; and, referring to our friend,
John Bull, Esq., page 97, to put themselves in communication wifli the Publisher, whose
address will be found on the cover.

TO his esteemed Friend and Fellow Colonist —of whom this, his Native-land, is
justly proud — HORATIO SPENCER WILLS, of Point Henry, Gee-
long (formerly 0/ Lexington, Mount William), Esquire— the Hon-
orable Member for Grant, whose enviable distinction it is, to have
originated in the Legislative Council, two of the most important measures
by which jit is possible to legislate for the great and general good of
the Inhabitants of this peculiar Colony, consisting of fertile soil, in an arid
climate—a wealthy, yet suffering community: — viz, '•'■for affording facilities
to the ‘ bona fide Cultivator ’ to obtain farming Land on terms advanta-
geous to himself and on conditions beneficial to the Government, and espe-
cially to the Public:” and “for causing Water to he procured and husbanded
for the use of Man and Beast, by artificial means, throughout Victoria, in
situations adapted to the formation of tanks and reservoirs, but naturally
destitute of rivers, brooks, or fresh-water ponds; ” and to the Honorable
the Speaker and all other Members of the Legislative Council of Victoria.
Gentlemen,
Trusting that the end I have in view, will be found
to justify my ambitious desire to draw for half-an-hour on your
valuable time; and conscious of being influenced by no unworthy
motive, in submitting my humble ideas—for what they are worth —to
my fellow-colonists, as well as, with all deference, to their enlightened
Representatives and to the Executive Government; —namely, the hope
of contributing by my quota of intelligence (which, however small, is
based on local experience somewhat large , acquired by twenty-five years’
residence in the Australian colonies), to the benefit of this com-
munity (which I hold to be, not only the proud privilege of English-
men, whose boast is “ freedom of the Press,” but the pleasing duty
to his fellow-men of every good subject) i I venture to adopt this
means of throwing out certain suggestions, which, as “ one of the
People,” I employed the anniversary of my arrival in this continent,
recently passed in a state of involuntary leisure, in addressing to the
local press. But the favour of giving currency to my humble opinions
in the journal of largest circulation, not having been accorded to me,-
in consequence of the length of my communication ; I have ventured to
place the M.S.—which has been returned to me this day —in the hands
of a highly respectable publisher, on the strength of his assurance,
that the importance of the subjects treated of —worthy of being
designated, as they undoubtedly are, “ The Questions of Questions ”
which now occupy the public mind —will rescue my effort to be
useful, from oblivion; and that even one scintilla of success, will
absolve the author from the obloquy of presumption. Under these
circumstances, I have resolved to “ cast my bread upon the waters,”
in the shape of the brochure which I now have the honour to submit
to your candid and impartial consideration.


Having, in common with most persons familiar with the press, an
insuperable aversion to copying or re-writing what has once passed
from my pen; I subjoin the letter, without altering a syllable, which
I amused myself by scribbling on the 29th of March, by way of
celebrating that, to me, memorable day. I would therefore be allowed
to deprecate the severity of criticism; and the candid reader will not
look for rhetorical flourishes or elaborate phraseology, in an unstudied
and rapidly written communication addressed to a newspaper; of
which, utility , or the hope of conducing to results of a beneficial cha-
racter, was the sole instigator. In penning that perhaps reprehensibly
lengthy epistle, the writer was —and in this his determination not to
hide his small light under a bushel, resolving with Robert Burns,
“ i’ faith I ’ll prent it,” he is—actuated by an earnest desire to aid in
the propagation of sentiments, in support of what he conceives to be
sound and beneficent principles , with respect to the most important
social interests of his fellow-subjects in Australia ; the predominance
of which sentiments and convictions in the Legislature, it is believed
by the undersigned, cannot fail to produce and to perpetuate in the
land, the blessings of plenteousness and prosperity —which no very
profound apology can be requisite for aspiring to promote, in this his
adopted country—and which he prays may be accompanied by health,
peace, and happiness.
With all deference to the Editor of the Argus , I am unable to dis-
cover in what respect my lucubration is more unsuitable to the ample
columns of that able and widely circulated Journal (in which it was
supposed to have a somewhat legitimate claim to insertion, in conse-
quence of this very topic having been partially discussed, as it loill he
further!) than many of the scores of letters by which the Thunderer is
diversified—but of this the Public must judge ; in the composition of
which letter, I had no other thought than to promulgate facts and
opinions, the fruits of my experience, in simple, but I trust intelligi-
ble language, the responsibility of which I avowed by my signature.
Being thus undesignedly driven into authorship, I will not neglect
the opportunity to append to my letter a few notes and extracts,
which—as my Essay, published in 1850, u On the Physical Qualities
and Capabilities of Australia Felix,” is out of print, and not above
a dozen copies remain—it may be convenient to bring into one view,
together with some re-prints which would have been unnecessary had
my letter appeared three months ago, at the time it was written.
With these explanations; humbly but earnestly commending the
one important subject treated of —Land ; and the other, more briefly
alluded to —Water ; to your patriotic consideration, as legislators,
not for the present emergency only, but for your own posterity as
Victorians, and for an embryo Nation bound to provide within itself,
as far as practicable, for the physical requirements of future millions; —
I have the honour to subscribe myself,
Gentlemen,
Your faithful fellow-Colonist,
Nat. Lipscomb Kentish.
Melbourne, 19th June, 1855.


TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘-ARGUS.”
Melbourne, March 29, 1855.
Sik, —Twenty-five years ago this day, on landing in Sydney from England,
—after touching ten days at Hohart Town—on greeting with inexpressible de-
light (which the termination, in health and safety, of a tedious voyage of six
months could not fail to heighten), the fair and long-looked-for continent of
Australia; I found it to contain fifty or, I believe, sixty thousand inhabi-
tants, of whom eighty or ninety per cent, were “ Prisoners of the Crown ”■—•
i. e. —convicts under unexpired sentences of transportation; and, perhaps,
three-fourths of the free population, consisting of “ emancipists ” (convicts
whose sentences had expired or been remitted) ; the small remaining propor-
tion, of about five per cent., being composed of military, and the staff of civil
officers of various grades, from the governor, —Major-General (afterwards
Sir Ralph) Darling, to the overseer of convicts in Hyde Park Barracks; —and
a small number of free settlers, comprising retired officers from the two ser-
vices, and a sprinkling of enterprising colonists—in general of high respec-
tability—who had been, most fortunately for themselves, induced by the
temptation of free grants of land, and unlimited convict labour, and even
greater advantages held out by the ministry of George IV., as formerly, but
with less success, by that of George 111., to such of their Majesties’ free sub-
jects as would display the vast amount of moral and physical courage, at
that time deemed to be evinced by the act of voluntary emigration to the
antipodal penal colony of “ Botany Bay.” A fourth, or more nearly, a third
of the whole population of Australia, was located in Sydney in 1830; of whom
about one-tenth part only, were females.
The 29th of March, in that year, I joyfully celebrated, by sleeping on
terra firma, in Prince’s-street. This, my quarter-century anniversary—albeit
no jubilee to me—l am employing in reminiscences of five-and-twenty event-
ful years passed in these colonies ; and, in contrasting the strange and as-
tounding present —the golden era of the World in general and of Victoria in
particular, in 1855 ; with the interesting, young, and promising country which
I found Australia (although gold was not dreamt of for twenty years there-
after), in 1830. But as it is not for the mere amusement of my own mind,
but in an humble effort to render my experience conducive to the benefit of
some at least, of the quarter or half million of fellow-colonists to which the
population of this fifth continent has increased during my residence in this
hemisphere, that lam desirous of spending this day ; —I propose, with your


kind permission, to throw out a few hints of a practical character, on one or
two of the many subjects of great local importance, which the observation
of the latter and more serviceable half of my life, and the great and wonder-
ful changes it has witnessed in this “ fifth quarter of the globe ” may, perhaps,
have qualified me to submit to my fellow-colonists, in aid of public opinion,
now very naturally, because feelingly, directed to the Question of questions,—•
Land, —how to get it and how to enjoy it, with advantage to the resident
owner (or tenant), and to the state.
Amongst the numerous aphorisms which, confirmed by experience, have
become established for the guidance of mankind—none will be more generally
or more readily admitted, than the maxim propounded by the great philo-
sopher, as well as lexicographer, of the last century, Dr. Johnson, that,
“ He is one of the truest patriots, and greatest benefactors of mankind, who
causes two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow, where but one had
previously grown.”
With this consideration impressed on my mind, and the enormous prices at
present current in Melbourne, of two shillings the four-pound loaf; meat,
sixpence; potatoes, fourpence per pound; water, fuel, and all other neces-
saries, in proportion (these last, consequent on the high rate of wages), in-
creased by the expense of carriage, some articles fifty, others 100 per cent.,
at the gold-fields; I could wish to impress it on the inhabitants of this colony,
whose population is increasing, and likely to increase, by many tens of thou-
sands yearly, whilst its insignificant extent of cultivation, if happily no longer
diminishing—as it had been doing since the gold discovery in 1851, till the pre-
sent year —is not yet extending in any degree at all commensurate with the
wants of the community. Impressed with these important facts, well may
anxiety be felt by the government, and by the people, and well may public
attention be directed to the consideration of Land, and the most legitimate
and effectual mode of bringing it into cultivation , so as to render the inhabi-
tants of the city, and of the towns —of the gold-diggings, and even of the rural
districts —less dependent on imports of bread-stuffs, even of hay for our horses
(at actually the same price per ton as sugar /) —of oats, and bran, potatoes,
fruit of every kind (dear and damaged) ; and to afford a hope, and some
chance at least, of obtaining vegetables on our tables with our meat, and
such a horticultural curiosity as horseradish, in this land of beef —which can
hardly be said to be the case at present; for, it is a favoured minority only of
this wealthy community, which is so fortunate as to be dieted on more luxu-
rious or more wholesome fare, than rations of bread and meat in towns; and
of meat and damper in the country.
What a change has come over the spirit of my dream, during the last twenty-
five years! The “ new chums ” will scarcely believe; but the patriarchal
“ old hands ” will bear me out in the fact; that, from twenty to twenty-five
years ago, the current price of meat was one penny per pound ; and I retain


one of my butcher’s bills, of 1831—Mr. New’s of Parramatta—as a cu-
riosity, in which I am charged, for so many pounds of beef and mutton, the
same number of pence; and for a quarter of beef, at three-farthings per
pound! About this time, I well remember being present at a public meeting
of the “ settlers”—meaning farmers and graziers in those days—held for the
purpose of taking into consideration their distressing circumstances, as the
owners and breeders of sheep and cattle ; at which Messrs. M‘Arthur, Blax-
land, Lawson, and other graziers and flockmasters, descanted feelingly on
their unhappy circumstances ; lamenting that, although the government had
more than doubled the convict’s ration of meat, and they (the graziers) were
well supported by the free population, who in general, with their families, pa-
tronised them at luncheon and supper, as well as at breakfast and dinner, sel-
dom eating beef or mutton ad libitum, less than four times a day ; yet, their
flocks and herds gained upon them to such an alarming extent, as to give rise
to serious apprehension that their live-stock would soon be so abundant, and
so far in excess of any possible consumption, as to cease to have any value at
all, beyond that of their wool and their hides : and the chairman, Sir John
Jamieson, actually suggested, and seriously proposed, that, in order to avoid
a state of things so much to be dreaded, and which seemed clearly to be im-
pending, the owners of live stock throughout the colony, ought mutally to
agree to kill their lambs and calves, to keep down their increase ; and it was
suggested that Sir John and the other stockowners present, should set the ex-
ample ! This sapient proposal, however, few will be surprised to learn, was
“ not carried; ” but, after a protracted discussion, it was arranged that a trial
should be made to form an export trade in cured beef; and the gentlemen in
the room put down their names, with the number of cattle which they"respec-
tively pledged themselves to deliver to the manager of a “beef export com-
pany,” then and there agreed to be formed; to be slaughtered, salted, and
shipped to London in tierces.
The effort to establish an export trade, proved triumphantly successful; the
meat was approved by the Royal and Mercantile Navy; and pronounced ex-
cellent, when some barrels were brought back to Sydney, after having been
carried round the globe. Within a year or two, meat advanced to three-
halfpence, and prime joints even to two-pence, per pound, and has never since
declined, but progressively increased in price—chiefly arising from seasons of
drought increasing the difficulty of bringing cattle and sheep from the remote
pastoral districts to Sydney; which was so much the case in the fearful sum-
mers of 1838 and 1839, that meat rose to what was, at that time, considered
the famine price of sixpence per pound; though, on the return of wet and
genial weather, meat fell rapidly to threepence; and I believe it has, since
that period, been but seldom below that average in Sydney, or in any other
town of the Australian colonies.
Little, indeed, was it foreseen by the settlers, or colonists, sixteen or


seventeen years ago, when their flocks and herds were first driven beyond the
settled districts, to graze on the unoccupied Crown lands in the then unex-
plored regions of New England, Yass, the Murray, and Murrumbidgee rivers;
of Bathurst, Wellington, Maneeroo, and the Darling Downs; and the term
“ squatter” was introduced and thoroughly established in the vocabulary of Aus-
tralia’s Anglo-Saxon sons; that an illimitable demand was about to be created
for their superabundant supply of live stock, and for any possible increase, by
the simple process of “ boiling down ” for the fat, which was introduced some
few years later; and which, though most wasteful in a physical sense, was but
little so in a monetary point of view r , as proved by the fact, that the settler, or
“ squatter” realised, for many years, very nearly, if not, as some think, quite as
large a net profit from the sale of the fat and hides of his flocks and herds, in the
markets of London and Liverpool, as he could have obtained for the animals of
the butchers, in the colonies : and still less could have been anticipated, the
virtual transfer of Smithfield Market to Melbourne, by the influx of hundreds
of thousands of British, American, European, and Asiatic immigrants, at-
tracted hither by the universal and omnipotent magnet,—Gold,—at that time
undiscovered and undreamt of in Australia, but found some ten years later in
these colonies; first in New South Wales, and early, in one enormous mass of
106 pounds weight, pointed out by an aboriginal native to his fortunate mas-
ter, near Bathurst; and soon afterwards in Port Phillip (now Victoria), in
quantities incredible, both on the very surface and at considerable depths; of
every conceivable form and weight, from a grain to a quarter or half hundred-
weight, at Ballaarat and Mount Alexander; —in one instance, a nugget of
132 pounds, and upwards (I think 1618 ounces, some penny-weights): but I
speak from positive knowledge, having not only seen this magnificent speci-
men, which had some very minute proportion of quartz, or conglomerate, ad-
hering to it, —supposed not to exceed five or ten pounds ; and which, in ap-
pearance was very much like a small leg of mutton, with the knuckle cut off;
but I saw it weighed at the Gold-office, in the Colonial Treasury ; and seeing
is believing.
But if such markets for the consumption of beef and mutton could not be
anticipated fifteen or twenty years ago, neither—it is fair to observe —did it
enter the mind of man in Australia in those days, as a circumstance within the
range of possibility , that in so few years thereafter, the entire extent of some
hundred millions, and upwards, of acres available for pasturage, could be ta-
ken up and located, and more or less grazed, by the new, respectable, enter-
prising, and valuable section of the community and class of colonists, the
squatters, who, even now, numbering about 3,000 only in Victoria and New
South Wales, share amongst themslves under the Government Regulations
twice the area of Great Britain, and on an average, perhaps, 40,000 or
.50,000 acres to each “ Run,” or more properly “ Principality,” as designated by
that able governor, Sir George Gipps.


Having thus rapidly glanced at the past; permit me, Sir, to direct your at-
tention and that of your readers, to the present state of things in Victoria
and New South Wales, with a population of some half-million of souls, and
the same number of mouths, increasing and likely to increase, by births and
immigration, say, 50,000 if not, as seems possible, 100,000 per annum.
It would be beside my purpose, and would be drawing unconscionably on
your valuable columns, to enter upon the delicate and much trodden ground
of colonial politics, or to enlarge upon the causes and consequences of the
anomalous and deplorable state of things existing in Victoria; namely, a
population of 300,000 ; an area of fertile soil adequate to the supply of
30,000,000 ; including a quantity of land purchased and possessed as freehold,
if not literally occupied by the colonists, ample, if cultivated, to supply the
inhabitants —numerous and daily increasing as they are—with an abundance
of all the necessaries and most of the luxuries of life; yet are we dependent
on importation from Van Diemen’s Land and South Australia, from Britain
and America, for nine-tenths of our provisions, as for the entire of our apparel,
furniture, and manufactured goods—in short, for everything but meat and
bricksj nor may even these be wholly excepted, as ship-loads of American
bacon and English fire-bricks abundantly testily to our confusion, and to our
national and individual loss.
Except in order to point to a remedy for these great social evils, which
convert this, in gold the richest, and in all natural advantages, one of the
most favoured countries on the face of the globe—into one of the dearest, most
comfortless, and most undesirable of colonies to reside in; it would be as
futile and unpatriotic, as painful, to allude to these sad facts, which are patent
to all intelligent persons in this colony, or even out of it, if at all connected
(as who is not, directly or indirectly ?) with this wonder and loadstar of the
world. These deplorable circumstances, have been brought about mainly, as
everybody knows, by the enormous rate of wages which, until of late, have
necessarily prevailed in the colony, since it became the grand theatre of
attraction to all persons of all countries who had a taste for digging gold out
of the earth for themselves, in preference to working, even at immoderately
high wages, for others; but such being the case, the matter for present con-
sideration is, what, under existing circumstances, can be and ought to be
done, to remedy such intolerable evils, and to convert this fair province into
the land of peace and plenty, which I will not doubt that it is by Providence
destined to become—l pray speedily.
The only, and the natural means of producing “ plenty ” (by which I mean,
principally, food of all hinds in abundance, and consequently at low prices'),
appears to me to be by bringing the Lands of the colony into cultivation to
such an extent, that the agricultural and horticultural productions of Victoria
shall l)e equal to, and in general excess of, the great and increasing demand of
her large population. This opinion may, perhaps, be assented to as a mere


truism: but immediately arises the important question, “ how is this to be
brought about?” The solution of this difficulty is a task worthy of the best
and most experienced of Australian Colonists, even of the great Australian
Colonist and Coloniser, the Rev. Dr. Lang, and could hardly be so well an-
swered by any other man, as by that talented, energetic Colonist and Historian,
the father of free immigration (which he introduced at his own risk, and in no
small degree at his own expense by the “ Stirling Castle,” upwards of twenty
years ago), and who ought, in common justice, to have been associated with Mrs.
Chisholm, in the well-merited tribute recently made by the Public and by the
Government, to that estimable and most praiseworthy amateur Immigration
Agent; for —though, unfortunately, not pulling cordially as a cooperator with
Mrs. Chisholm—it is a matter of fact and of notoriety, that that lady in vigorously
effecting the immigration of large numbers of females and of families, which
to her great honour, and their advantage, and that of the Australian colonies,
also of the mother country, she has successfully done ; Mrs. Chisholm but
followed in the wake of that enthusiastic Patriot and Colonist, Dr. Lang.
In order to occasion cultivation to take place, it is manifest that agricul-
ture and horticulture must be made remunerative occupations. Neither free-
holder nor tenant, will in general study the interest of the public so much,
and of themselves and their families so little, as to dig or plough and raise
corn, vegetables, fruit, or hay, unless they can be tolerably sure of realising by
their produce a living, and even a liberal profit. This can never be the case,
whilst labour is excessively high here, and so much lower in the neighbouring
colonies, still better adapted to cultivation, that the Tasmanians and South
Australians can afford to under-sell us in our own markets. There are two
modes of counteracting this state of things in any country, both of which have
been resorted to in the United Kingdom, viz., duties on imports, having a ten-
dency to check importations from other countries ; and premiums given by the
Government to encourage the production of commodities which it is found ne-
cessary to stimulate, but which are not per se, sufficiently remunerative to in-
duce the inhabitants to cultivate them. This latter mode was had recourse
to in the early days of New South Wales —nor this alone; but seed was lent,
Land given, and convict labour granted, many years, until the colony was made
to produce a superabundant supply of wheat, oats, and barley, etc., etc., which
were as cheap and plentiful twenty or thirty years ago, as was meat; prices
ranging about ss. or 6s. per bushel for -wheat; 3s. to 4s. for oats and bailey ;
maize, 2s. 6d.; potatoes, ss. to 6s. per cwt.; and garden vegetables and fruit,
about half the prices current in England, instead of quadruple, or in some in-
stances, tenfold those prices, as has been the case here the last three or four
years. But the former is the plan which has been adopted from time immemo-
rial in England, until the novel and strongly resisted Corn-law Reform intro-
duced by Sir Robert Peel, in 1848, by which the market was thrown open to
all the world; and the great principle was adopted of free trade in corn, by


which it is assumed, that the great mass of the people,—“ the millions ”of con-
sumers, —are benefitted, by obtaining, each the largest quantity of bread for
his money; and no apprehensions seem to be entertained of any material
diminution of agriculture in the United Kingdom, in consequence of this
great change in her fiscal regulations; nor of any great inconvenience to arise
therefrom, if such should prove to be the case. Perhaps, and probably in a
country situated like Britain, within a few weeks’ —almost days’—reach of the
great marts in the old and new world, with the binding relationship of mutual
interests firmly established, this may be all very well; but, as there is no rule
without exception—may it not be deemed that this country, in its peculiar and
unprecedented circumstances and position, is precisely the exception, which
may help to confirm the soundness of the general rule ? Such, I trow, is the
case. But, without asserting that the time may never arrive, when it will be
expedient to resort to the old bounty principle, in order to encourage the Land-
holders to “ speed the plough,” and become a corn and wine growing people,
and cease to be a community of shopkeepers and gold-diggers only:—I venture
an opinion that it is the true policy of Victoria to promote agriculture through-
out her vast territory by every legitimate means; of which, in her present
circumstances, import or customs duties is not one, but would be suicidal and
unjustifiable in the highest degree.
The chief, and indeed the only, mode of encouragement, which I would ad-
vocate, and have advocated for twenty years ; and which I deem would prove
effectual and sufficient, is that of enabling all persons who will guarantee to
cultivate the soil, to become possessed of farms, as freeholders, and even as
lessees, upon liberal, easy , and even seductive terms. My attention having
been directed to this subject as much as, and certainly for a longer period
than, most of my fellow-colonists; this is not the first time I have employed
my pen with respect to the circumstances and capabilities, etc., of this colony;
and an observation which I made on my first visit to Melbourne, with respect
to the streets of our metropolis, is so perfectly applicable to my present
purpose —the actual cultivation of lands located—that at the risk of being
obnoxious to the charge of egotism, I will venture to quote (a) from a former
paper of my own (“ Lecture on Australia Felix,” p. 94), that in this instance,
as in the other of locating town-allotments, there is one, and but one mode,
of protecting the public, and preventing the advantages of the colonists in
this instance, as the comfort and convenience of the citizens in the other,
being defeated and sacrificed by the purchasers to whom the land is conveyed;
and that is, by subjecting it, by the conveyance deed, to certain conditions,
binding on each locatee, and inflexibly enforced by the Crown, for the general
benefit of its subjects residing in the colony, i.e., for “the public good.” Need
1 to say, that the condition on which I would counsel the disposal of land
adapted to cultivation, freely, and in every part of the colony, on terms within
the reach of all disposed to cultivate and to rely upon cultivation for their


support, is simply—that locations of land shall be cultivated , and in such pro-
portion to their extent respectively, as is reasonable, and shall be stipulated
in accordance with a sound and judicious code to be carefully considered
and irrevocably established, and subject to penalties in case of non-cultivation;
—the gist of which regulations should be this ; that whereas, on fulfilment of
the stipulated conditions, the Crown shall make and issue to the locatee a
conveyance of the fee-simple of his location ; so on the other hand, on proof
established of any material breach of the conditions stipulated, the occupant
shall be treated as a tenant-at-will, who shall be liable to be ejected upon
notice given, and the Land, with its improvements, shall revert absolutely to
the Crown.
The high prices which are at present realised by farmers for their corn,
hay, potatoes, turnips, and produce of every description (although these, it is
to be hoped and expected, will materially decline), and the healthful and
agreeable life which country pursuits imply, and which is in general much
desired by persons of all classes, if their operations can but be earned on, on
a small freehold estate of their own which is unquestionably the most
independent life that can be conceived, and one of the most enviable—will,
there is no reason to doubt, dispose a very large number of persons, including
perhaps the majority of unsuccessful gold-diggers, to resort to the spade and
the plough, if, out of the 62,000,000 of acres in this fair province, they can
be enabled to select from 10 to 50 or 500 as their own, on moderate terms, to
be paid for by instalments at remote dates (of course paying interest in the
meantime, with security on the property, which in general must be every
year increasing in value), so that they might retain their capital for present
use in building, fencing, and bringing a portion of the land into immediate
cultivation ; instead of being deprived of the means of improving and cultiva-
ting, by the transfer of their money into the Colonial Treasury in payment
for Land, at or before it is actually conveyed to them by the Crown ; as is the
case under the present Land Regulations,which compel payment in full, within
a month, of whatever amount a purchaser may have been “ run up” by
Speculators and Land-sharks, or it may be, by fair but injudicious competitors,
at auction.
In determining at what prices, and on what terms, it may be reasonable
and judicious, on the part of the Crown—(or rather, I may say, on the part
of the People, through their delegated Representatives—alluding to the New
Constitution, the advent of which is arrived) —that is to say, just and gene-
rous, towards those parties who guarantee to become “ producers” of corn and
wine for their fellow-subjects and for the community at large; all existing
circumstances must be taken into consideration ; of which those most materi-
ally bearing upon this subject, appear to be : —lst, the circumstances under
which possession has been given by the Crown to its subjects in the colony,
of the million and half of acres already located, viz., the price actuallypaid forthe


same; and the fact of an understanding having existed in the public mind, not
only in this colony, but throughout Australia and the mother country, from
the day the first grant was issued to John Pascoe Fawkner, Esq., and his
enterprising pioneering colleagues the discoverers and first settlers in Port
Phillip, to the present time; that one pound per acre is the minimum price at
which Land should pass from the Crown to any individual subject, or com-
pany ; and 2dly, the rights and interests of the Crown—by which is to be under-
stood, as before observed, “ Representatives delegated to conserve the interests
and fair advantages of Her Majesty’s subjects resident in Victoria.”
In the early days of the settlement of Australia, when on the vast surface
of this continental island, there were no other inhabitants, exclusive of the
simple aborigines, than a handful of British subjects, consisting almost en-
tirely of convicts under sentence of banishment, and the officers in charge of
them; nothing could be more wise or generous on the part of the Crown, than
the issue of free grants of Land to all who possessed the ability and incli-
nation to settle on and to improve the same. But it is, perhaps,
unnecessary to point out, that the case is slightly altered now—and that
the circumstances of Victoria, with a population of 300,000 inhabitants,
increasing by thousands in a month, and sometimes in a day, are not precisely
the same as in 1830—with which year the “granting” of Land ceased except
to purchasers at public auction ; the minimum price having been established
at a pound per acre since 1833, on the petition of the South Australian Colo-
nization Commissioners —which was at first fixed at five shillings, and in the
second year raised to twelve shillings per acre, at which price it remained till
the founding of the new colonies of Port Phillip and South Australia, opened
the eyes of the Home Government to the real value of Land in Australia,
which as soon as purchased of the Crown in large blocks at a few shillings per
acre, was subdivided and re-sold in smaller sections or “choice corner allot-
ments” in townships by the fortunate grantee, at a great many pounds; the
price being invariably found to increase in an inverse ratio to the size of the
valuable property and choice selection disposed of: thus, a section of 640 acres
bought of the Crown for £l6O, being found too large for the occupation of the
first purchaser, he would “ accommodate" some friend with one-half, for £5OO ;
who subdividing his best half into four “ snug farms” would retain one, and
consent to part with the others at only £4OO a-piece ; one of which fortunate
purchasers of 80 acres at £5 per acre, discovering that nature had evidently
designed the N.W. corner for a township, would lay it out accordingly in
“ splendid allotments” varying from a quarter to a sixteenth of an acre each,with
noble “ frontage” to Imagination-street 30 feet wide, and “ let them go” at
moderate prices, varying from £lOO down to £2O each. This is a true sample of
the early age,and of the present mode of “making money,” by Land Speculators.
Now, after having sold nearly a million and half of acres at an average (of
course inclusive of Town Lands) —of more nearly £lO than £5 per acre ; what


sort of justice would it be to the present owners of this Land, for which the
Government has actually received some six or seven millions, and for which a
much greater amount, has actually been paid for it by these Freeholders, to one
another in purchase, mainly of speculators, who have subdivided and raised the
price at each partition to a total of more nearly twenty millions; —what kind
of treatment of these Landowners, who have purchased so dearly all the Land
at present located ; to commence all of a sudden giving away Crown Lands ad
libitum to New Chums? Perhaps, reader, you are the proprietor of some
choice corner Town Allotment, which, at only one or two hundred pounds per
foot, cost you, say £3,000 —or of a charming paddock of 5 or 10 acres in the
suburbs —or of a farm of 200 or 300 acres in the neighbourhood—or say a
section of 600 or 1000 acres in a good locality near some new township, a
day’s journey from Melbourne or Geelong—or it may be of a large block of
3000 acres, which from the magnitude of the purchase, and its remote situa-
tion, escaped the clutches of grasping competitors in the shape of Land Sharks,
and you obtained at the minimum price; which alike, whether 3000 acres, or
1000, 500 or 50, 10, 1, or an eighth of an acre, we may still suppose to have
cost you £3OOO. What would you think of the Government giving to Dick,
Tom, and Harry, and as many New Chums as might present themselves, for a
song—for five shillings per acre and several years to pay it, similar sections
of Land, and it may be adjoining to that very property which has cost you of
the Crown £3OOO ? Surely the injustice of such a regulation, would not be
less real and less felt, or less vehemently protested against by the entire
Landed interest, than the employment of convict labour in competition with
free—or than the cultivation of Crown Lands by Squatters to raise corn, and
under-sell in the market the cultivators of purchased Freehold Land ?
This would be manifestly unjust. Besides, such arrangement would
deprive the Crown—which means the executive government of Victoria—of
the fee-simple of the waste lands, which at one pound per acre would amount
to £60,000,000, but may be moderately estimated at thrice that sum, as real
capital; the use of which, as rendered available from time to time, may for
some ages provide the colony with ample means for its good government, and
for effecting roads, railroads, canals, and ample reservoirs , bridges and fortifi-
cations, and public buildings of every kind requisite to minister to the safety,
comfort, and advantage of the inhabitants, and entirely averting the occasion
for direct taxation, which must exist in all other countries not possessed (as
no old and occupied territory can be) of millions of acres of Crown Land, the
price of which, as located, is continually falling into the public exchequer.
I therefore assume that Crown Lands ought not to be disposed of in any
case, under the established minimum of £1 per acre ; nor do I advocate the
propriety, or admit the justice, of their being disposed of materially below
their fair intrinsic value;
happens to be unreasonably and unnaturally high, as has been the case the


last two or three years—but their just and proper price, according to situation
and quality, when things are in a sober, healthy state, as is now becoming
more and more the case daily. Nevertheless, lam of opinion that it is right
and proper, that every possible encouragement should be given, that can be
legitimately given, by the Government, to cultivation ; and that it is a duty
imperative on the Executive and on the Legislature to afford such; the
power being in their hands, and only requiring to be exercised impartially,
on a judicious and liberal system. The principle of such system has already
been enunciated six weeks, by Horace Wills, Esq., the Honorable and useful,
experienced and practical Member for Grant (6). Taking up the key-note
which had been so ably and energetically harped by my friend ; the influen-
tial assembly of gentlemen representing the important commercial interests
of this great country (in every sense of the word “ great”), have by their
agitation and elaborate Report, and the able Reply which that document
elicited from the well-practised pen of the father of their Chamber of Com-
merce,W. Westgarth,Esq. (c) —w'ell known and deservedly celebrated as a stati-
cian and Australian author, as well as senator —brought the subject of land and
cultivation, fairly and fully before the public, disclosing the disgraceful and even
alarming neglect of cultivation prevalent throughout this colony, even amongst
the owners and occupiers of Freehold Land ; the very last of whose thoughts
it seems to be, to make any other use of the same, than as a medium of
speculation , with a view to immediate profit! To the admirable principle
propounded by Mr. Wills —and which I, for one, contended for, when the
sale of Land was first introduced in N. S. Wales —I think no reasonable
objection can be made —no tenable objection can be raised. But in
order to meet the difficulties of the present extraordinary times —in
order to afford still greater encouragement to the purchasers of Land to
become bona fide “farmers;” and in order to insure the “cultivation” of
the Land located to them ; I venture with all respect to throw out the
suggestion to the Government, and to the Honorable the Legislative
Council, that whilst according undreamt-of advantages to the new locatee;
conditions should also be required of him, so that the advantages bestowed
on him by the Crown, may be sure of being reciprocated by the public! My
plan would be this—to abolish the auction system, the unfairness of
which, in its actual operation, is so great and so notorious, as to render its
exposure supererogatoiy ; and to enable any and every free subject of the
Queen to obtain land for spade or plough husbandry, under the following
arrangement: —a block of, say 1000 acres, being marked out by the Govern-
ment as open to selection, applicants to be supplied in rotation according to
the priority of registered application, with any portion, from 10 to 100 acres,
in such position as the Surveyor-General may sanction, in conformity, as
nearly as may be practicable, ■with the wishes of the applicant— upon these terms
and conditions —namely, that he shall pay for the same, the price according to


a previous fair and moderate valuation, inclusive of the surveyor’s fee for
marking it out upon the ground, by a deposit of ten per cent., and nine
annual payments of the same amount; the second payment to be made at
the end of the fifth year, and the tenth payment, which will complete the
purchase, at the end of fourteen years : thus allowing the purchaser the use
of his entire capital (except the deposit) for the first five years, to enable him
the better to provide himself with labour, and with bullocks and horses,
ploughs and harrows, carts, etc. etc., and requiring of him only the interest
annually on his unpaid purchase-money, which becomes a virtual mortgage
rental or capital lent to him, on the moderate interest of, say five, or not ex-
ceeding eight per cent, and payable by easy instalments. In return for these
great and extraordinary advantages, the purchaser to guarantee that he and
his family (or other person to whom he may transfer his land, with the consent
of Government, and subject to the same conditions) shall reside upon and
cultivate the same—not breaking up and bringing into culture less than a
certain proportion each year ; and shall not let off any part without consent
in writing from the Government, nor enter into any trade or business in-
dependently of farming the Land in question.
I would have no person who does not choose to subject himself to such
restrictions, required or desired to do so; but such dissenter may purchase
Land of the Crown by auction in the usual manner, or of any of the multitude
of speculators and Landowners willing to accommodate him. The regulation
I have thus dared to suggest, will, as it appears to me, be a just and liberal
and equitable arrangement, and not a one-sided, partial scheme, which must
be open to valid and strong objections. The Government will thus insure
the sale of large quantities of Land, at fair and reasonhle prices ; it will have
the very best of security, real property, increasing in value yearly and daily by
cultivation, with moderate interest from the date of giving possession : it will
at the same time confer substantial benefit on thousands of worthy men and
families, and give rise to those best of classes, a respectable yeomanry, and a
body of freeholders cultivating their own farms, throughout the colony ; and
further benefit the public at large, by gradually and effectually, and I opine
with much rapidity, promoting the cultivation of the soil, and the growth
of corn and wine, hay, fruit, and vegetables within our own territory, for the
consumption of the people, giving them a large loaf and a cheap one.
In offering these suggestions, I have not the weakness to expect to please
everybody, or to desire to do more than satisfy reasonable persons, whether
owners or occupiers of Land —whether growers or consumers only of its pro-
duce. lam aware that some will contend, that Waste Land ought to be “given
away” to every one who will undertake to cultivate it: with such, it is my mis-
fortune to differ in opinion, my reasons for which I have already explained ;
and I concur entirely in the doctrine laid down by Mr. Westgarth, in the ad-
mirable “ Remarks” of that Gentleman, on the recent “ Report” of the Com-


mittee of the Chamber of Commerce, on the Laud Regulations at present in
force”—(which document is, nevertheless, itself admirable, and a disquisition
of great importance)—that the “principle of giving for five shillings, what the
buyer would immediately sell for five pounds, is wrong , and liable to be grossly
abused.” But in dissenting from so high an authority, with respect to the system
of rack-selling, i. e., of obtaining the uttermost price for Crown Land, by sub-
mitting each plot as it is selected by a person desirous of purchasing, cultiva-
ting and residing upon it—to the competition by auction of eveiy man who may
or may not have occasion for it, but who, as a speculator on the selector’s
judgment, or from having a longer purse, or from having his attention directed
to a good selection which another has been at some trouble and expense to
find out, and has set his heart on, is invited to outbid him and “ run it up
I not only am supported by a strong opinion very decidedly expressed by the
great majority of the intelligent members of the commercial community ; but
I have strong reasons for believing this to be the sentiment of the Landed-in-
terest generally; (not of the speculators in Land, known as “ Sharks,” and not
inaptly named) —at all events, it is the conscientious sentiment of a disinte-
rested and experienced Colonist, who is—so he believes—influenced by no
worse or other motive than the desire to promote the public-weal of his
adopted country, with a strong leaning, not against, but in favour of, that
“ Patriot, and intending Benefactor of his Fellow-Colonists,” the enterprising
Agriculturist, who proposes to reclaim the wild bush from the comparatively
barren state of nature, and by using his axe to clear primeval forests, and
and putting his spade and his plough into the virgin soil of Victoria, not only
to “ produce two blades of grass where but one had grown before;” but to
produce tons of fine oaten and clover hay per acre, instead of a few hundred-
weight of coarse bush grass ; and 30, 40, or 50 bushels of good wheat per acre,
perhaps more, or oats or barley, where not “ one grain had before grownand
potatoes and garden-stuff, vines and fig-trees, turnips and mangold-iourtzel,
lucerne, and all other valuable productions which may be reaped in this
colony in abundance, if but sown !
But I would not be understood to limit the location of Land to purchasers
only. There will ever be—and I believe it is not undesirable, that there should
be—a class of cultivators and producers, amongst the hardy, and I trust honest
and virtuous poor, constituting a Yeomanry and Peasantry recognised by all
Political Economists, as “their Country’s pride,” as well as a more opulent
class of higher grade, “ Gentlemen Farmers of their own estates and unless
I could see any reason for supposing that the Crown (or “ the Government,’’
as we say in the colonies), would be a harder and a more undesirable Land-
lord, than a large Land-proprietor, who is not unfrequently a speculator in
Land, bent only on making the greatest return possible on his investment, and
who may therefore be likely to extort from his tenants a high rack-rent; I
cannot refrajn from recommending, that plots of ground, of size proportioned


to their means of employing such, should be leased by the Crown on very mo-
derate terms to “ Cottagers,” who will guarantee that they will bona fide reside
upon, and “ cultivate” a certain proportion of the same. What that propor-
tion should be—whether the rent might not be taken in grain—what propor-
tion it may be reasonable to allow to remain untilled in natural grass for the
cows and horses’of the tenant (or purchaser, on the terms and conditions above
proposed), Ido not presume even to hint. These are details for the arrange-
ment and decision of the Government, under the advice of its responsible and
competent advisers. All that I, as one of the People, and a Colonist of twenty-
five years’ observation and experience, presume to bring under public consi-
deration, is the “ notions” as Brother Jonathan would say —to which, my
lengthened experience, as a Government Surveyor in three Colonies, and an
Editor in one of them, has given rise; and which,'as one of the oldest Colonists,
and (until the other day), the Senior Officer in the Civil Service of the Crown
in Victoria, I am not ashamed to avow and to advocate, in the belief that their
introduction—especially at this critical period—will be productive of unmixed
benefit to the Colony —of good to all, as a community (except, indeed, the very,
very few hut certain Land Sharks, who will be thereby defeated of their in-
tended and expected thousand per cent, on their speculations—for whom I do
not feel, and am not aware who can feel, any extraordinary degree of pity),
and of immense benefit to thousands and tens of thousands of worthy and enter-
prising Immigrants and their families, of every grade—from the humble gold-
digger (successful or “ unsuccessful digger,” of course I mean—hut it may
be of good family), who has no other dependence than, under Providence, the
exertion of his thews and muscles, and his energies, with indomitable resolu-
tion ; to the capitalist—whether in pounds sterling, or in stalwart sons—desi-
rous and competent to embark more largely in agricultural enterprise; and to
the Colonist able and disposed to withdraw from the turmoil of mercantile or
professional life in the city, and to enjoy in quiet amid rural scenery, the
otium cum dignitate of “ Ketirement,” not of unprofitable existence in the country,
but as a cultivator of his own estate—or to his son the fortunate owner of pa-
ternal acres, so beautifully described by Virgil, and by our own pastoral poet,
Cowper.
“ Hackneyed in business—wearied at that oar,
Which thousands, once fast chained to, quit no more,
But which, when life at ebb, runs weak and low,
All wish, or seem to wish, they could forego;
The statesman , lawyer, merchant, man of trade ,
Pants for the refuge of some rural shade,
Where, all his long anxieties forgot,
Amid the charms of a sequestered spot,
Or recollected only to gild o’er,
And add a smile to what was sweet before,


He may possess the joys he thinks he sees,
Lay his old age upon the lap of ease,
Improve the remnant of his wasted span,
And, having lived a trifler, die a man.
Thus conscience pleads her cause within the breast,
Though long rebelled against, not quite suppress’d.
Ye Groves (the Statesman at his desk exclaims
Sick of a thousand disappointed aims),
My patrimonial treasure and my pride,
Beneath your shade your grey possessor hide;
Receive me, languishing for that repose,
The servant of the Public, never knows.”
Another and most important subject, intimately connected with Land and
its location and cultivation, is Water. And with respect to this important
and much needed element of comfort and success, in agricultural (or pastoral)
pursuits in this hot and arid climate, in which the sad paucity of rivers and
of fresh-water lakes or ponds, is the great and almost the only physical evil
—the one serious drawback to set off against the advantages of a glorious
country, possessing abundance of fertile soil, and the most salubrious climate
and exhilarating atmosphere in the world —[of course excepting the limited
localities of large and at present undrained towns ; and the immediate lines
of much worn high roads, which from the surface soil being converted into
an impalpable powder, fill the lungs and the eyes with dust during the
suffocating heat of the sirocco, too frequently experienced in Australia during
the summer months]: with respect to this evil and its remedy, my friend the
Honorable Member for Grant, is also the Man to have first mooted the subject
in the Council, and to have moved for assistance to be afforded by the Go-
vernment under authority of a vote of the Legislature, to enable the inhabi-
tants of ill-watered and unwatered districts to construct Reservoirs, in situations
adapted by nature to receive and retain large quantities of water from the
ample winter rain, and from the occasional heavy thunder showers in the
summer, for the use of the public ; under judicious regulations, it is to be
hoped, which remain to be formed, as does this valuable and most important
measure to be initiated, with many other desirable undertakings under the
new Constitution, being for the present in abeyance, (d)
That it is most important and desirable that some such measure be intro-
duced by legislative enactment, as that suggested by Mr. Wills, first specifi-
cally with respect to damming the mouth of the Bar won, (e) and converting
Lake Counewarre into a body of fresh water for the benefit of the inhabitants
of some twenty or thirty miles of country —thereby metamorphosing one of the
very worst, into one of the very best watered districts in the colony, (which I


hope and anticipate to have the gratification to witness, under the auspices of
the talented Surveyor-General, who has personally and officially examined the
locus in quo ) —and secondly, as the enunciation of a general principle, pro-
posing that £25,000 should be placed on the estimates towards the attainment
of this very greatest and best of objects ;(cT) no man will doubt, who, like the
Honorable mover or the undersigned, is a practical man, long and intimately
acquainted with this Colony and its physical as well as moral requirements
and resources.
So forcibly impressed was the writer, with the paramount importance of
this consideration, and with the expediency of turning to account the vast
capabilities of this splendid hut arid pastoral country (immediately after his
first inspection of some millions of acres of the same, chiefly in the hot
and level district of the Murray), with a view to remedy the crying evil “want
of water; ” that—as may be in the recollection of some of your readers—he
prepared and read before the members of the Mechanics’ Institute, in July,
1849, a paper on “ the physical qualities and capabilities of Australia Felix,
with reference principally to the best remedies of the great evil of the in-
terior—a deficiency of Water.” The views and ideas put forth in that docu-
ment, afterwards published (and of which I presume that a copy may be
seen at the Institute), may I would hope, be deemed worthy of consideration
by all who, like the Hon. Member for Grant, shake off the apathy of which
squatters and settlers in Australia, are unfortunately, by common consent,
convicted, and take a real and earnest interest in this subject of literally
vital importance. (f )
To allude even to the many ramifications to which anything approaching
to a full discussion of the most important interests of Australia, namely, un-
locking the Lands effectually, and efficiently giving Water to the colonists, and
as far as practicable to their live stock, would necessarily lead; would involve
a volume, rather than a column of print: apologising therefore for the great
length to which my lucubration has unwittingly extended, I will confine
myself to one single remark, namely l —that valuable public reservoirs may be
made under legislative enactment, in thousands of sites, (as illustrated by the
magnificent pool which affords a good supply of Water to the large popu-
lation of Campbell Town, New South Wales, who formerly had to cart
their water from the Manangle, a distance of five miles) — before Crown
Lands are disposed of to purchasers, each of whom has a right not only to
fence in his farm or his allotment; but to open dykes through the same or on
his boundaries, if he think proper; but which desideratum cannot be effected
afterwards, when once the ground is subdivided by ditches, and located.
I have the honour to remain, Sir,
Your very obedient servant,
N. L. KENTISH.

Proceedings of Legislative Council, Feb. 20, 1855. (Argus.)
THE'motioaj'of .the Hon. Member for Grant, debated in the Legislative Council on the 20th
February, 1855, and/or the present “negatived,” on the ground of it not being within the power
of the House, to amend or alter the Imperial Land Regulations, as yet in force; (the principle
on which it is based, namely, that of enabling the industrious agriculturist to occupy and
cultivate land, for his own advantage and that of the community, by the sale of farming land in
small quantities on long credit —being at the same time warmly applauded even by the Hon-
Members who spoke against the motion)—is as follows;
“1. That in the opinion of this House, it is of moment to the present advantage and future
prospects of this colony, that agricultural operations be carried on with prompt industry.
“2. That crown'lands of great extent adapted for the plough, exist in those portions of the
colony known as ‘intermediate’ and ‘unsettled’ districts.
“ 3. That the system now pursued in the disposal of crown lands in certain localities therein,
is opposed generally to the prosperity and happiness of the people, and directly to the
financial interests of the country.
“4. That to insure the speedy occupation and cultivation of land fit for agricultural pur-
poses, and the full value thereof to the Crown, (due regard being paid to Reserves where
necessary for the preservation of the winter rains; and also strict reservation of the
rights of the crown where minerals may be supposed to exist); allotments, in situations
at the option of his Excellency the Governor and Executive Council, not less than eighty
acres each, should be open to selection by persons Intending to become bona fide occupiers
thereof, on payment of twenty-five per cent, of a valuation, in no case less than one
pound per acre.
“5. That with a view to insure the cultivation of the land so selected, the occupier should
be entitled to the use for grazing purposes of a like quantity of the land adjoining, for
the term of three years, at a nominal rental; and at the termination of that period,
provided he shall then have under cultivation not less than three-fourths of his original
purchase, be entitled to purchase the second plot of land on the same tenns—or if it be
of less value, at a price according thereto.
“6. That the balance of purchase-money due on each selection be payable by equal instal-
ments in two and three years respectively, bearing interest at the rate of eight per cent,
per annum.
“7. That nothing contained in the foregoing resolutions shall be considered to interfere with
the right of the Executive to the disposal of Crown Lands under the system now in
force, in such places as to them may seem advantageous to the general interests of the
country.
“8. That these resolutions be embodied in an address to His Excellency the Governor.


In his very effective opening speech in support of the above resolutions, Mr. Wills is re-
ported to have said, “ a few days ago he had received a statement of the agricultural products
imported into the colony during the year 1854, viz., flour and bread, 31,272 tons; wheat, 128,315
bushels; barley, 62,560 bushels; malt, 85,062 bushels; maize, 94,707 bushels; rice, 2,321 tons;
other grain, 35,903 bushels; butter and cheese, 3,332 tons; potatoes, 12,394 tons; onions, 549
tons; and of hay, 10,656 tons; and vegetables, 158 tons. He (the honourable member) had
submitted that statement to an experienced mercantile man, who had, at very low rates, esti-
mated these imports at upwards of two millions and a half.

Report of the Special Committee of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce on “the best
means of promoting Agriculture and the Settlement of the Waste Lands of the
Colony.”
Your committee disclaim all political feeling in this momentous question; they have en-
deavoured in all their suggestions to provide for the general welfare of the colony, irrespec-
tive of all class interests; and in laying before the Chamber the result of their labours,
your committee wish it to be understood that in making the following remarks on the Land
Question they are not wedded to any particular system; if a more practicable and equally
comprehensive mode can be suggested, they are prepared to support it.
Your committee having duly considered the subject, and availed themselves of all the
documentary and other evidence they could procure, as well as information furnished by
several members of the Chamber, practically acquainted with what has been done in other
countries, have agreed in the following Report, which they now with confidence submit to
this special meeting of the Chamber for its approval and adoption:—
1. Your committee cannot but express their decided conviction, that the present Crown
Laud Regulations of the colony are radically defective, and have tended to produce and
aggravate much of the depression under which the colonists are now suffering.
2. Your committee consider, that it is only by a complete Change in these regulations
—their thorough revision and remodelling,—that the colony can gradually be restored to
a state of permanent prosperity.
3. Your committee declare, without fear of contradiction, that the sale of Land in Vic-
toria has failed to provide food for its population. Out of 62,800,000 of acres, the estimated
area of the colony, about 1,400,000 acres have been sold up to the present time; the remain-
der is held almost entirely by 800 individuals, under the annual licenses of occupation for
pastoral purposes. Had proper care been taken when selling the above Lands to secure
then- improvement and cultivation by the purchasers, it would have provided food for all
the present population of the colony; but as there is no such condition involved in the
terms upon which the Land has been alienated from the Crown, it is the opinion of your
committee, —although, in the absence of all reliable statistics, they have no positive evidence
—that not one-tenth part of the land sold, is actually under cultivation with crops suitable
for the food of man.
4. Your committee consider that the aspect of the Land Question has been entirely altered
by the sudden and large increase of the population of the colony, an increase unparalleled
in any country, except California On the 31st December, 1850, about four or five months
after gold was produced in quantity, the whole colony contained about 88,000 souls; and
on the 31st December, 1854, it may safely be estimated at 320,000; shewing an increase
m three years of 232,000 souls. It is most desirable that a sufficiency of Land should be
sold, and not only sold, but cultivated, to provide food and employment for this large in-


crease in the population, and render us in this respect independent of the neighbouring co-
lonies and of foreign countries.
5. Your committee report that the effect of the large increase in the population, com-
bined with the large production of gold, and the want of any provision to insure the cul-
tivation of the land—has been to diminish the resources of the colonists, and impoverish the
colony generally, by causing an yearly importation of breadstuffs and vegetable productions
to the amount of two millions, all of which we have to pay to the neighbouring colonies,
to Chili, the United States, and the mother country.
6. Your committee, while deploring a state of things so prejudicial, to the welfare of
the colony, express their conviction that the evil will be aggravated year by year, as popu-
lation increases, if an effort be not at once made to change our Land System, and suit it
to the wants and desires of the colonists.
7. Your committee beg to draw the attention of the Chamber to the great rise in price
of all agricultural products; premising that they quote the Melbourne wholesale prices, which
are much enhanced by the cost of carriage to the mining districts in the interior, where a
very large proportion of our population is now settled, all of which might be supplied
much more cheaply by the cultivation of Land in the immediate vicinity. They quote
from the “Victoria Almanack,” for 1855:
Wheat per bushel, Oct. 1850.. .. 4s. 3d. Oct. 1854 15s.
Maize, do. „ 2s. 6d. „ 10s.
Barley, do. „ 3s. Od. „ 10s.
Oats, do. / ~ 3s. 3d. ~ 9s. 6d.
Bran, do. „ lid. „ 3s. lOd.
Hay, pertou, „ £3 15s. „ £2O
Flour, Ist, do. „ £lO 10s. „ £35
Potatoes, per cwt. „ 6s. or £6 per ton. „ £2 ss. or £4O per ton.
B.—Your committee are of opinion that the system in operation at the present time for the
disposal of Crown lands is the worst that could be adopted in a country like Victoria. In a new
country, land should be obtainable by actual settlers at a low rate. The experience of Canada
and the United States,—countries settled and improved by Englishmen and their descendants,
proves that the greater the inducements offered to emigrants, in enabling them to settle
on small sections of land, and in the terms of payment, the more the country advances
in prosperity and wealth. California, one of the States of the Union, presents so strong
an analogy to the circumstances of Victoria, —in the small number of inhabitants prior to the
discovery of gold; in the rapid increase of population, and enhancement of the price of labour
and of food, that we cannot do better, Vhile considering this great question, than keep it
constantly before us. But all analogy ceases when we come to the land question. Owing to the
freedom from artificial restrictions and impediments, California, within six years, has become an
exporting country. We have good soil, abundance of it, a fine climate, and an energetic popu-
lation ; let us remove the barriers which prevent us from free access to our lands, and in a few
years we shall do as California has done.
9. It is the opinion of your committee, that the policy of Government in the sale of Crown
lands has injured the colony, and impoverished its inhabitants. Had our Crown lands been
surveyed and offered for selection, at a low fixed price, to actual settlers, the land would have
been cultivated, and an immense amount of capital retained in the colony; all of which has
been either swallowed up in the purchase of land at a high price, or paid to other countries to
provide us with food. The following shows the quantity of land sold and the price paid for it
at different dates
Ist July to 31st December, 1855,—501d, 145,000 acres, for £838,557, or nearly £6
per acre.


Ist January to 30th June, 1854, —sold, 213,270 acres, for £810,789, or nearly £4 per
This money has been employed partly in making roads and bridges, and partly in bringing
out emigrants; but your committee think that the extraction of £1,600,000 from the pockets of
the colonists in twelve months, has impoverished them and absorbed a gvat part of the capital
that would, with land at a cheap rate, and thereby entailing loss on themselves and their con-
nections ; also to the numbers who have come out to Victoria, and returned to the old country,
or re-emigrated to the neighbouring colonies, in consequence of the want of suitable employ-
ment.
10, Your committee have to report that the present system has had the effect of causing
Government and the land speculators to combine against the interest of the great body of the
colonists. By the 11th section of 5 and 6 Victoria, the Land Sales Act, the Governor is em_
powered to raise the upset price one-tenth part of any country land offered for sale; but at a
late Government land sale the proportions were almost reversed—about one-tenth was put up
at £1 per acre, and nine-tenths above that rate. Besides this, in general, all lots at £1 per acre
are too large for the small farmer, but are eagerly purchased by speculators and capitalists; and
whenever a working man, the most valuable kind of settler, attempt to purchase a lot of eighty
to a hundred acres at a Government sale he is exposed to the competition of parties who never
intend to occupy or cultivate the land.
11. To remedy this state of things, your committee, after due consideration, have to sub-
mit to the Chamber the following outline of a plan, similar, in many respects, to that which
has attracted such an extensive emigration to Canada and the United States, altered, in a slight
degree, to suit the circumstances and wants of the colony of Victoria. It has been your com-
mittee’s wish and endeavour, to provide a remedy for the present state of things, to avoid any
partiality to a particular class, and to have our land system established on a firm and permanent
basis.
12. In recommending their plan to the Chamber, the committee have refrained from al-
luding to vested interests, or to any claims which may exist upon the Crown lands of the co-
lony, for two reasons: firstly, it does not come within the scope of their duty; and secondly,
they consider the interest of the great mass of the people to be paramount, and that any impe-
diment in the way can be equitably arranged.
13. Your committee recommend to the Chamber the following system, as one which has
been tried and found successful in Canada and the United States, and has furnished a home to
thousands of our countrymen, and which has tended year by year to increase the prosperity of
those countries:—
Plan foe the Disposal and Settlement op Ckown Lands.
I.—The Colony of Victoria, so far as practicable, to be surveyed and subdivided into township
sections, of about six miles square, or a superficial area of 36 square miles.
2.—That roads be laid out at proper intervals in every township.
3.—That every township be laid out in sections of one square mile, or 640 acres subdivded
into 8 or 16 sub-sections or lots, of 80 or 40 acres respectively.
4.—That Government reserve for sale all land ascertained to be mineral, also such lands as
may be necessary for Government purposes, such as military stations, and other public
buildings.
s.—That Government land offices be established in different parts of the colony, where all
information shall be provided to the intending settler, in relation to all lands offered for
sale in the neighbouring townships, its location, description of soil, adaptation to agri-
cultural or grazing purposes, its facilities for irrigation, etc, Also that detailed plans of
the surveys be kept in these offices, showing the reserved lots, those sold, and what
remain unsold.


S. That any subject of Great Britain, or any foreigner who may declare his intention of
being naturalised, be entitled to select and enter upon any quantity of such unsold
Land, say from 40 to 640 acres, at the fixed price of five shillings per acre, on the follow-
ing conditions: —
L That he forthwith commence the improvement of the same by fencing, erecting a habita-
tion, and cultivating; and your committee would recommend that any foreigner becom-
ing a purchaser should be thereby entitled to his letters of naturalisation and enjoy all the
rights and privileges of a British subject.
2. That within one year he pay one-half of the purchase-money, or 2s. 6. per acre.
3. That within two years he pay the balance of 2s. 6d. per acre.
4. That Government shall, thereupon, give him a clear title to said land, subject to his own
use and disposal for ever, at a fixed charge of one pound for each title.
5. That, from the day of entering on the land, the settler shall be entitled to all minerals on
or under the surface.
6. In case such purchaser fail in any of the before mentioned conditions, he shall lose any
improvements he may have made, and his laud shall be open to selection and purchase
the same as if it never had been occupied.
7. All real estate in every township shall be subject to taxation for the following purposes,
such taxation to be imposed by the inhabitants of each township respectively;—The
cost of government of such townships, including police courts, jails, etc.; also for malting
and keeping in repair all township roads; also for the support of public schools, and for
the maintenance of the poor, and for any other improvement that the inhabitants of such
township may deem necessary for its advancement or protection.
8. That any township be empowered to borrow money for public works or improvements,
duly providing for the interest and repayment of principal of its loans, by taxation on all
the property of the township.
14. Your committee feel that the Chamber will look to it for the reasons which have in-
duced it to recommend the foregoing, to its adoption. Your committee think that the stimulus
of cheap Land, which is now annually draining Europe to the amount of nearly 400,000 persons
who all settle in the United States and Canada, has been the main source of the prosperity of those
countries. We are at a much greater distance from the mother country and from Europe, but
your committee is satisfied that were it once known that in Victoria, under the British flag, a
home was offered to all the world, combining the advantages of moderate price, easy terms of
payment and local self-government, we should induce an amount of immigration, of which, at
present, we have no conception.
15. Your committee venture to express their conviction, that were the Crown Lands of
this Colony thrown open on the above terms, the general Government would be at once freed
from a position which at present embarrasses it much, viz., the providing of magistrates, police,
forage, etc., for all parts of the country. By giving the Colonists local self-government, your
committee believe that the people would be more contented and happy, and would provide ade-
quately for their own wants.
16. Your committee would likewise remark on the impolicy and injustice of the emigra-
tion system at present in force. It is most expensive, and provides us with the worst class of
immigrants. The sending money home for such a purpose, has tended to raise the passage-
money of the immigrant who comes here at his own cost, at least 50 per cent. Besides, we
furnish Government immigrants with employment on their arrival, and board and lodging till
they get it; while we tax the industrious and valuable class of free immigrants, and leave them
entirely to their own resources.
17. Your committee do not hesitate to condemn this vicious system, and to recommend its
abandonment. They are satisfied that we shall get sufficient immigrants of a superior class,


by opening up our lands at a low price; and that we are only draining the colony of its resources
by remitting over half-a-million annually to bring out an inferior class of settlers.
18. Tour committee are decided that the present system of auction sale of Crown Lands is
most impolitic, and is rapidly diminishing the capital of the colony. The farmer requires capital
quite as much as the merchant. In a new country he incurs heavy expense in preparing his
land for crop, and has to wait for that crop before any return can be received for his outlay; and
if he has to lay out all his capital, as at present, to buy a piece of land, he has none left for im-
provements.
19. Your committee would briefly allude to the importance of opening up the country by a
general system of railways; they would merely express their conviction that nothing would
tend more, in conjunction with the sale of Land at a low price, to develop the resources of this
fine colony, and to render it great and permanently prosperous.
20 Your committee find that the present Land System is producing the same effect as the
English Com Laws; capital and men are fast leaving the colony, and finding their way to
countries which will yield a better return; the price of food is kept at an artificial rate, while
the wages of labour are falling day by day. To throw open the Lands, we should at once require
railways and labourers, capital will find that it can be profitably employed, and the price of
labour will not fall materially, even should the expense of living be much reduced.
21. Your committee would point out the great benefit of District Land Offices, in affording
reliable information to the settler, in the immediate neighbourhood of the Land he wishes to
purchase, and securing him thereby from being deceived by Land Jobbers or Speculators.
22. It is clearly for the interest of the Government that the Colony should be settled as
soon as possible, and by people who will not only purchase, but occupy and improve the Land-
Our general revenue is raised by a tax on the consumption of spirits, wines, beer, tobacco, sugar,
tea, and coffee; and surely everything that adds to the number of producers, will increase the
number of consumers also, and the more will Government get in the shape of taxation.
23. Your committee cannot think that the occupiers of pastoral lands would be prejudiced
by any measure that will increase the number of consumers of beef, mutton, and wool; they
know how much their interests were improved by the rush of population following the dis-
covery of the gold-fields, and thereby can estimate the value of a continued increase of co-
lonists.
24, Your committee consider it imperative on the Government to do all in its power to avert
a famine. With a large population dependent almost entirely on foreign countries for breadstuffs,
we are liable at any moment to feel the effects of a bad crop in the neighbouring colonies. We
possess a soil capable of producing everything required by man, and it behoves the Government
to place no stumbling block in the way of opening the lands. Were we to be thrown on our
own resources, owing to short imports of food, or a bad crop in the other Australian colonies,
your committee believe that the whole country would be thrown into anarchy and confusion.
25. In concluding their report, your committee have to mention that their wish has been
to recommend the introduction of a system of land sales, based upon the broad principles of so-
cial and political economy. They feel satisfied it will recommend itself to the Chamber and to
the community at large. It has been their wish and endeavour to avoid anything of apolitical
nature, and to free the question from any allusion to existing interests, whether of occupiers or
purchasers of land, under the present regulations. Your committee are convinced that once the
great question of really and truly settling the Crown lands is brought fairly before the public,
the settlement of vested interests will be a matter easily arranged.
26. Your committee would sum up their report in a few words: —
Ist. It condemns the sale of land by auction, and consequent competition,
2nd. It points out the evil effects of a high price for land.
3rd. It shows that at present no provision is made for cultivation or improvement.


4th. It shows that capital is fast leaving the colony, and that the colonists arc im-
poverished by their means being spent on laud and on the importation of food.
sth. It recommends an entire change of system:—
Land at a low price , and easy terms of payment , with the view of attracting and retain-
ing capital in the colony.
Provision for cultivation and improvement of the land.
Local Government and taxation for all roads, etc.
District land offices, to afford information to purchasers.
By abandoning Government immigration, it destroys the competition which has in-
creased the free immigrant’s passage-money at least fifty per cent.

Remarks in opposition to the Views of the Committee of the Chamber of Commerce,
upon the Land Question. By William Westgaeth, Esq.
The Credit System, in the selling Public Lands, is undesirable in a colony so large as this, in
complicating Government accounts, and placing large numbers of the people in a dependent
and unconstitutional relationship to the Government.
The price of ss. per acre is too low, as a general minimum, in a colony whose entire terri-
tory has been extraordinarily enhanced in value by the gold-fields, and is now so wealthy and
populous.
To do away with the Auction System is to abrogate the only satisfactory mode of dealing
with tens of thousands, requiring lands that are of endless diversity in point of quality and
value.
The alterations proposed, moreover, are not competent to colonial powers, as the present
Land Eegulations are an Imperial Act These regulations were adopted after much debate, and
the abrogation of some previous regulations that approached nearer than the present to the com-
mittee’s proposals.
Giving away Land so cheaply as here proposed would have the undoubted effect of promptly
settling the country. It is, in fact, almost equivalent to giving the Lands for nothing, which
would have a like prompt effect. But besides a needless sacrifice of the public property by
such a procedure, there is the question of th ejust dissatisfaction it would occasion; for assuredly
such would be the result where this commodity of Land was given away at rates far under its
current market value in blocks to each that would ensure every thing available being speedily
taken up, and that at a faster rate than any surveyor’s staff could reasonably supply. Assuming
there are twenty millions acres of available Lands in Victoria yet unsold, this quantity at five
shillings per acre would not require more than six months’ value of the colonial exports, for the
purchase of the whole. If every one could take a square mile, this would be Land for thirty
thousand persons, and assuredly at ss. per acre that number would promptly present them-
selves as applicants for the whole twenty millions. These persons, or the prompting capitalists
who may be in the back-ground, would most likely find ways and means alike of evading and
complying with the law. If the colony could not be thus bought up, it would be chiefly, per-
haps solely, because the official surveys were in far arrear o£ the applications for Land, and this
would occasion endless dissatisfaction, even more than at present, because it would appear that
a comparative few were getting more than enough at nominal prices, while the great bulk
would get nothing.
The case of America is quite different from that of this colony, and offers no fan analogy.
The area there, as compared with here, is unlimited. Although the Land there is given cheap,


yet, after clearing the timber, it stands in reality much dearer than the comparatively clear
Land of this colony. In America, the forest Land thus given at 4s. or ss. per acre, has, in its
natural state, no higher current market value; whereas here, even if it were possible that the
whole colony could be surveyed and brought forward for sale at the same moment, on the com-
mittee’s terms, the value of many millions of acres, accessible as proposed to the first appli-
cants at ss. per acre, would bear a far higher market value than this official price.
The principle of giving for ss. what the buyer could immediately sell for £5, is wrong, and
liable to be grossly abused. If the apprehended abuse is attempted to be corrected by certain
restrictions and enforcements as to the land, the correction itself may be a drawback, to say
nothing of the proverbial facilities of evasion. It seems altogether unadvisable to bind every
one to cultivate purchased land. Cultivation is only one among many different modes of use,
to which land is beneficllaly applied. There should not, therefore, be compulsion in this res-
pect, because it is quite impossible to prescribe or predict what the best use may be, in each
locality or each case. Instead of a regulation of this kind, the object might be attained with-
out any injurious pressure, by taxing unimproved property in common with other property,
according to its assessed actual value; in short, placing all real estate, whether improved and
occupied or not, on the same footing as to the public burdens.
The present land system has not answered, because it has not had justice. The defect seems
not in the minimum price or the system, but in the supply being altogether inadequate.
Under the present system, millions of acres might be always available for selection as the
unbought overplus of auction sales. It is highly desirable to urge upon the authorities those
steps which they are actually empowered to take, and so procure an immediate remedy. Millions
of acres should be promptly surveyed to be in readiness for sale. Instead of a resolution of the
nature proposed, viz., the adoption of the report, he should suggest the adoption of the follow-
ing, which he should move as an amendment:—
That the thanks of the Chamber are due and are hereby given to the committee for the
valuable and interesting information contained in the report they have presented.
That the views of the committee, however, have had reference to colonial land systems in the
abstract, rather than to the particular imperial regulation under which the lands of this colony
are administered and which the colonial Government is not authorised to alter, even if the views
of the Government and the public were agreed in their object.
But the fault hitherto with the land system of this colony has been the very limited quantity
brought forward for sale by the Governqjpnt; and that as this has proved of great injury to the
colony, and the remedy is urgently required—it be an instruction to the committee to reconsider
this subcct with reference to what can be at once accomplished by the powers conferred in

AGRICULTURAL RESERVOIRS.
The lion. Member for Grant, moved in the Legislative Council, on the 20th March, 1855,
that “this House resolve itself into a committee of the whole, for the purpose of considering
the propriety of presenting an address to the Governor, praying that His Excellency will be
pleased to place on the estimates for the year 1855, the sum of £25,000 for the construction of
dams, or other arrangement for the preservation of winter rains, in such agricultural localities
as to the Executive may seem desirable.”
The desirability of giving effect to the proposal of the honourable mover, was cordially ad-
mitted by the Honourable the Colonial Secretary, by the energetic Member for Talbot, Mr.
Fawkner, and all other members generally, who took part in the debate; and as amended by Mr.


Campbell (so as to include pastoral as well as agricultural districts, and the amount increased
to £50,000), was carried; though strange to say—by a majority of one only: but still more
strangely was “ shelved ” (but happily only shelved until the next session) —by the anomally of
rejecting the adoption of the report just made by the chairman of committee, “ that the resolu-
tion of the Honourable Member for Grant, had been agreed to;” several of the supporters of the
measure having, in the brief interval, left the House, under the impression , that having given
their vote and divided the House on the motion, which was carried —the matter was disposed of,
affirming Mr. Wills motion ! which was thus lost, by a remarkable and ludicrous inadvertency
only; to be brought forward and doubtless carried triumphantly in the next session, more me-
thodically : the proposition of such vital importance to the far greater part of the entire area of
the colony—sixty-three millions of acres—being in the mean time taken up ardently in numerous
localities, and systematized by the Honourable mover, Mr. Wills, for the benefit of the Colony
at large.

PAPER ON “ AUSTRALIA FELIX.”—p 84.
It has been demonstrated that it is perfectly practicable, as well as highly desirable, to
remedy the evils felt so severely in seasons of drought, which are here of such frequent oc-
currence, by the application of ordinary intelligence, in preserving in tanks and reservoirs, a
supply of that element, of which the want is so severely felt, eleven, or more than eleven
months in the year—although enough rain falls in a week or two of the winter—and not unfre-
quently, in some genial but heavy thunder-shower in the very hottest weather—to supply the
country, Sheep, Cattle and all, for the whole year, if water were husbanded with ordinary care,
instead of being permitted to run off to waste, as rapidly as it falls on the surface; which, being
sandy or porous, has not a vestige of moisture remaining on it, after the third day.
It is unnecessary to observe, that a sandy surface cannot be made to retain water, without
the entire of the bottom and sides of the basin, being perfectly lined with soft tenacious clay,
well worked, in the manner called by navigators ‘puddling;’ and although to do this, and cart
the clay from a distance, must be an expensive undertaking—there are thousands of cases in this
Colony, in which no money could be so advantageously expended on a Run. But there are num-
berless situations, in which the soil is perfectly tenacious, and nothing is wanting but a little
labour, judiciously bestowed. Of the modes of employing this, with most advantage, we will
now take a cursory glance.
A dead level—which we often hear spoken of on land, as applying to an extensive tract
strictly speaking, does not—nay, cannot exist. The vast Plains of the Murray, are in common
parlance , in many parts, for miles together, “a dead level;” and I can vouch for several situa-
tions, which I have tested with the spirit-level attached to my theodolite, and have found not to
differ above a foot or two, in a mile: but, even if I knew, as perhaps I think, that I could
point out two spots, a mile, or several miles apart, of precisely the same level, to an inch; it not
only does not follow, that it will continue so, like the surface of a lake, the whole intermediate
distance, from one point to the other, and the same crossways, and in every direction; but just
the reverse of this. Where the surface soil is entirely sand, and the rain penetrates equally
through it, as through one largo sieve, this will be most nearly the case; hut this is not very
general; and even where it is, the whole being saturated, and some water being left on the sur-
face occasionally, in very heavy rains; as this water subsides by miming off upon the surface, it
will, of necessity, form channels, however slight, coursing away to the river or nearest creek;
because, in the nature of things according to the proverb, 11 Water will find its level”—will run


to the lowest ground. Upon even the most level of our Plains then, places may be found, if
sought (and I need hardly to observe, that floods and heavy rains, are the best times to find
these out) —which are perfectly capable of being converted into, being by nature adapted to the
construction of Reservoirs. Suppose a Country which is not level, but gently undulating, as
that surrounding this City: spots, I feel assured, must occur to the recollection of each person
present, which are by nature well adapted to the purpose we are considering: the most obvious
to the superficial observer, is that of a strong channel or ravine, down which the water poms,
time of rain : a strong dam thrown across such channel in a narrow place, will simply and surely
form a Reservoir: and this is most true; but an engineer by profession, who has made this sub-
ject his study, will view the matter in a totally different light, from that in which it is seen by
the uninitiated. This can only be explained, but may be so clearly explained, by a diagram;
that however roughly it may be represented on a black board for canvass, with a piece of chalk
for a pencil, my ideas will soon, by this means, be made intelligible to all; and if I were a
younger man, or more weak-minded than I am, I should not thus reveal to all, one of the secrets
of my profession: but I have very little jealousy in the composition of my mind, such as
nature and some culture have made it: on the contrary, lam a decided utilitarian , and ad-
vocate the diffusion of knowledge of every kind, especially of that which can be made
practically useful and beneficial to all who will apply the information imparted to them.—
Here it is—a very simple thing when understood—but like Columbus and his egg, until known,
a matter of as great difficulty, as standing an egg on its end; of as general ignorance, yet of
great importance.
If advantage were taken, by the employment of a little judgment, or it may be science,
to make use of those advantages which nature so kindly presents to the grazier in this fine
pastoral territory; tanks or reservoirs, might be made in ten thousand instances, to contain
a million of tons of water, at less expense than £lso—and at the trifling cost of from £lO to
£5O, such minor tanks, as would be beneficial beyond calculation, and would in many in-
stances pay for the expense of construction, in a single season. Of course, it is desira-
ble in such a climate as this, that the reservoirs or tanks should be deep—as the evapora-
tion is great in summer—and water will keep longer pure, when of great depth, as well as
being cooler, in proportion as its surface is small: and these are the very objects desiderated.
In general, it will answer well, to cover an artificial, or even a natural water-hole, with a
roof, either of thatch which is best, or shingles, or even thick boughs laid on rafters, to
shelter it from the sun, by screening it entirely on the North and West. There are vari-
ous modes of preventing cattle from rushing into and fouling the water, which is so preci-
ous an article as to deserve to be taken care of; but I pretend not now, to such details as
these.
I have now briefly adverted to the principal—to the two principal means—by which the
terrors of an Australian Summer in the Bush, may be very essentially mitigated; and these
two, well-sinking, and especially dammixo-up —are of almost universal application, as al-
ready explained.
But in a very large portion of Australia Felix, I can vouch from practical knowledge,
and months of personal observation daily, last winter—though an unusually dry one—that
these are not the only, nor the best modes of providing water all the year, on the stations
on the Murray; on some of which, I have myself seen water carted to the out-stations, a
distance of from 5 and 10, to that even of 18 miles: I trust there may possibly be some few
gentlemen present, from that remarkable district; and from the deep interest which I can-
not help feeling in a subject connected with what has over been with me a favourite branch
of my profession, irrigation—in reference to a country of which I have surveyed no small
portion (half a million of acres, extending 100 miles on the north bank of the Murray)—and
am, therefore, perhaps, the first person to have observed with professional eyes, and with
spirit-level constantly in hand, the great peculiarities of that magnificent district;—if not the


first to notice, I believe it is my lot to be the first person to draw attention to the subject,
by thus publicly, however imperfectly, describing to the audience I have the honour to ad-
dress, of Port Phillippians, those circumstances and peculiarities, which it is both a sin and
a shame, should he longer neglected to be made available—of course, I mean, to the benefit
of the truly fortunate lessees. It would not, however, be difficult to show, that as the
community consists of individuals, the colony at large, would partake of the benefit; but this
woidd be diving into political economy; which is quite beside my present purpose.
The physical construction of the vast Plains of the Murray, is a peculiarity in respect to
Australia; and little less so, with respect to the terra firma of the globe. In the district of the
Lower Murray, which I have inspected—indeed surveyed—and I believe the same of a vast ex-
tent which I have not seen; that magnificent body of water, the reservoir of many millions of
acres—that splendid mole, has been ordained by Providence to work its tortuous course—not
as is the case in most other rivers, and in all others in these colonies, and in Britain, with which
I am acquainted—as in V. D. Land is invariably the case—through the lowest ground, so as to
become the channel into which rain and surface water must flow from the adjacent lands: but
through a vast plain, of what is called a dead level, and is very nearly such, as I have explained
—the sluggish stream flows gently on towards Lake Alcxandrina in South Australia, through
the highest instead of the lowest tract that exists. The formation of such extraordinary and
most advantageous course of a large river, through a level and in general arid country, is, I
apprehend, perfectly explicable on Geodesical, or perhaps, I should say philosophical principles.
To these I may not now advert, without intruding too much on your time, which it was pro-
posed to devote to another purpose ; and, therefore, I must confine myself strictly, as the law-
yers gay ad rem. Such is the great fact, which, though not generally known, I can prove, as
I now positively assert; and if there be any gentlemen present, acquainted with the Murray
River district, they must, I know, confirm the truth of my assertion. The River Nile, there can
be no doubt, is similarly circumstanced, the overflowing of which fertilises by irrigation, so
large a portion of Egypt: and some considerable portion of the Po also flows through a channel
higher than the land contiguous: and doubtless such may be the case in numerous instances,
with which, in this newly-inhabited portion of the globe, we are but little acquainted. But
this fact is as important to that country—the Murray District—as it is extraordinary: all
the channels connected with that great river—and they are numerous—are the aqueducts
formed by water pouring not into, but out ofi that great basin, when it overflows its banks; and
as a person practically acquainted with the subject, I could not but be struck with what to me
appeared a perfect phenomenon—and a most providential one indeed it is; which I conceive it
to be absurd in the extreme—if not actually wicked—to neglect to benefit by. To me, it can
only be compared to persons perishing, or literally letting their flocks and herds perish of
thirst, -with abundance of water within their reach, which they are too indolent or inconsiderate
to draw from the well—or rather, from the fountain, in their view—nay, forming the very
boundary of their princely domains. Such apathy can only proceed from repletion. However
excellent the pasturage, healthy and sheltered the country, and convenient the locality, on
which a grazier may have squatted with his flocks and herds; -when, on the approach of sum-
mer, the want of water is sometimes seriously felt; it is quite obvious, that in a pastoral
country of boundless extent, and unobstructed by fences or mountain ranges, or ravines; the
migratory shepherds and flockmasters would seek a remedy, by driving their flocks and their
herds in the direction which they might judge most probable to find a creek, until they came to
water; and would then squat, and keep their sheep and cattle within a few miles of that indis-
pensable element, whether the feed bo good or bad—little or almost none. But from the
moment a Squatter is limited to certain boundaries—however extensive his Run may be—it
certainly behoves him to adopt means to provide and secure water all the year round, on !iis
own grating domain.
Some suggestions have been offered, how this may be done in ordinary situations. We


■will now speak of tlio extraordinary and highly favoured situation of the Flats on the hanks of
the Murray. I myself have seen, know of, and could point out, hundreds of situations, in
which a simple, hut stout flood-gate —which might he made on the spot, fixed and completed
at half the expense of five pounds; would pen up water, and keep all the natural holes, and
great part of the channel of a Creek filled, of very many miles in extent, hy simply preventing
the water running back into the River, when it falls (which it docs, as it also rises, rapidly) ;
and I can point out Stations, not a few, which might, and when the attention of Lessees shall
be roused to the subject, I doubt not yet will, benefit far. more than £lOO a-year, by the erec-
tion of a common flood-gate, in a judicious situation, at an outlay of fifty shillings, or we will
say of £5. This, Gentlemen, is the egg !—when once the plan is adopted—(and I cannot believe
persons to be so blind to their own interest, as to neglect this simple, but sure and important
means of benefiting themselves, and incalculably improving their stations) —it will, it must
become general; and it may perhaps be remembered, as I certainly could wish it to be—that
the pleasure of publicly making and promulgating this simple but important and practical sug-
gestion, was reserved for the individual who has the honor to address you, this, twenty-fifth
day of July, 1849.
But this simple and obvious mode of keeping the water in the Wakool, Thule, Beremagad,
and a thousand other Creeks and ana-branches of the river on the Plains of the Murray, when
that river has overflowed its banks and filled them—though the mode of least expense and most
easy to be adopted generally—is neither the only nor the best means of watering that country,
nor anything like it. By either of several various modes—of whieh a common pump worked by
a crank, is amongst the best for simplicity and economy (but a steam-engine would of course be
more powerful and effective), and at a trifling outlay between three or four stations, whose
lessees might unite for the purpose; (though 1 believe I could point out a better, more simple,
and less expensive mode than either) —water being raised to, or a little above, the height of the
river bank—say 12 or 15 feet perpendicular—a stream of water might be kept fresh and constantly
flowing from out of the river, to points so distant as 15 or even 20 miles, throughout the entire
summer months, thoroughly watering the whole intervening country. Again, by means of
pipes—or better, by open shutcs or troughs—water might be conveyed, even on the surface of
the ground, to any desired locality: and in hundreds of situations, a canal large enough to
carry a boat or flat bottomed barge or punt, might bo constructed at an expense ridiculously
small, in comparison with the immense benefits to be obtained by such, in thoroughly watering
—as by a river—a tract at present almost valueless, being quite unavailable in the summer;
and at the same time, affording the best possible mode of transit from one estate or station
to another.
By and by, in a few years, when that splendid country shall have become populated—but
long before the charming but expensive desideratum a railroad can be introduced —(and I have
not the slightest doubt in my mind, of steam carriages, conveying at the rate of 15 or 20 miles
an hour, (perhaps 30,) all the Sheep and Cattle, as well as bipeds, which at present cannot
travel at the average rate of above half-a-mile an hour, viz: twelve miles a day, (which is more
than far enough, in a journey of two, three, or four hundred miles) by rail, between Sydney
and Melbourne, before tins day twenty, if not this day ten years), but between this time and that,
it may possibly, and I conceive not improbably, bo found well worth while, in several parts of
the Country—formed, as it were, by Nature, for the purpose—to open regularly navigable boat
canals; which may be done at an expense incredibly small, and—if population but increase—
with advantages, not incredibly, but amazingly great. Whether these are to accrue to the
Government, or to enterprising individuals, with judgment to embrace the golden opportunity,
remains to be tested; but I hope and expect, by both.
Much, as Canals are superseded as a medium of transit, by Railroads in Britain, which is a
cool and well watered country: in these colonics of Australia, which are precisely the reverse,
in both respects—and especially the Murray District, being excessively hoi, and in Summer


utterly destitute of water —Canals must be incomparably more desirable and advantageous than
Railways. It is almost surprising to us, who know something of Australia—and to all persons
not resident in, and who can have no practical knowledge of this continent, it must be very sur-
prising—that no use whatever, is at present made of the splendid channel and gentle stream of
the Murray (more resembling an artificial canal, except from its great and extraordinary bends)
—for the purposes of navigation. The wonder, however ceases, as soon as it is known and con-
sidered, that the population—l mean the white population—does not amount to one sold per
thousand, nor in some parts per ten thousand, acres; whilst in the United Kingdom and in
Europe generally, population averages—exclusive of cities and large towns—from one to ten
souls per acre; that is, from one thousand to one hundred thousand souls in England or Ire-
land, to one solitary individual on the River Murray. lam of opinion, however, that even with
such limited population; as there are stations on both sides of the Murray, at an average dis-
tance apart, of say from 10 to 20 miles—taking the course of the river: or at all events, that
there are, according to Ham’s map, about 80 or 90 Settlers on the river:—l feel assured, that a
steamer of small draft of water, would pay even now: but when the tortuous course of the river
is known, no one can suppose it would be navigated, except by a steamer as a trading and
carrying river craft. In one instance I have surveyed a bend of the Murray (or series of bends)
of six miles, enclosing for my fortunate employer, a paddock of several thousand acres, (for no
enclosed tract of land is too large to be designated “ a paddock ” in these colonies) —by a fence
of a few tods, I was going to say—but I believe in the instance I allude to, there is upwards of
one mile of fencing to the enclosure, or horse-shoe formed by the river, of six miles: but in ano-
ther instance, on the same river, to my perfect recollection, a fence of an eighth of a mile, or
forty rods, encloses a horse-shoe paddock of two or three miles in circumference, at a well-
known place called “The Slaughter House,” from the circumstance of some hundreds of cattle
belonging to Mr. E. B. Greene and Mr. John Clarke, the enterprising Squatters and Pioneers
for others in that fine district, who first ventured to settle amongst the formidable tribe of the
Murray, having been slaughtered wholesale by the Blacks, on this very spot, six years ago.
When the splendid Plains of the Murray, shall be somewhat more fully occupied, than by
one sheep to ten or twenty—one head of horned Cattle to fifty or a hundred—and one human
being to a thousand or ten thousand acres—lrrigation may be employed with immense advan-
tage ; of which it is almost idle, even to think, in a country so nearly uninhabited, though most
admirably adapted by Nature to the noble purpose; of which the accomplished explorer, Count
Strzelecki, and the talented engineer, Major Cotton, speak with judgment, based on scientific
observation, as well as with patriotic enthusiasm as Australians. No part of Tasmania, and
probably no other part of the Australian Continent, is so well adapted to irrigation, and to the
cultivation of Tobacco and Sugar, but especially of Rice, and other tropical productions requir-
ing much moisture, as the noble Plains of the Murray.
I may not venture to enlarge on this subject, of great interest to me as a matter of physical
science, and benefit to Australia Felix; but of much greaterinterestto scores of wealthy and for-
tunate Settlers who may easily, if they will, convert their hundreds into thousands of pounds
capital, and vastly improve their Estates and Runs, or rather Principalities at the same time :
but I must forbear, or shall I detain you too long, without even adverting to Artesian Wells,
which might in many instances be introduced with as great advantage here, as in any part of
the Globe; unless it be the Great Sandy Desert of Sahara, where they have been successfully
employed several years.

On the 9th of February 1855, it was moved in the Legislative Council, by the Hon. Member
for Grant:—
“ That an Address be presented to his Excellency the Governor, praying him to order an
immediate survey of the Barwon River at its junction with the sea, and to obtain a Report as
to the practicability and probable expense of effectually closing that outlet, in order to the
sweeping by floods of the salt water from Lake Connewarre, and the eventual attainment of
fresh water, of the same, or if possible of greater depth.!’
The debate on Mr. Wills’s motion, resulted in its being carried mm. con. But after the official
Report of the Survey having been laid on the table of the House, with Plan and Section of the
Barwon mouth, on debate on the 27th April, the proposal to apply to Government for a grant
of money to carry out the object of the Hon. mover, was negatived, on the ground that whilst
the expense would inevitably be very great, the result was somewhat questionable; and even
if from more full and perfect examination, it should be decided by a majority of the House, to
to be a desirable object to be effected; yet as it was of no urgent importance to be immediately
carried out; it would be one of the many desirable public works which being not indispensable,
must be deferred to a period when the finances of the Colony may better afford to bear the
expense. Thus the matter rests for the present.

Paper on Australia Felix.— Page 94.
Connected with this view of the subject, there is, however, one point, so important to the
Government, to the citizens of Melbourne, and inhabitants of Geelong, and other towns, which
are springing up in Australia —one, to which I can perceive no indelicacy, or impropriety, in
adverting; but from the agitation of which, incalculable good may arise; that I trust no apology
can be necessary for directing public attention to the mode in which the towns are laid out—or
rather, I should say, to the circumstance which has defeated the intentions of the Survey De-
partment, and of the Government, with respect to the formation and arrangement of the streets
of Melbourne and Geelong; converting towns of good design, consisting of broad and hand-
some streets, and building allotments with large gardens, and back entrances to each—into a
crowded town of dirty lanes and narrow alleys, without a garden, or space for one, in the
whole city, and scarcely the possibility of a back entrance to any dwelling-house; instead of a
private road in the rear of each. The fault and the misfortune to the entire city, and to eveiT
soul residing within it, are so palpable as not to be doubted or denied by any one—not even by
the spoliators themselves. But whilst all witness, all admit, and all deplore the evil —which is
particularly striking to every new comer; — is it wise with the Report of the Sanitary Com-
mission before us, proclaiming that which is palpable to the sound common sense of each citizen,
viz —that such crowding of small huts, in dirty alleys, must engender cholera and all sorts of
disease, in such a hot climate as this; and that the only remedy of this evil, and preventive of
disease, must be found in opening wide and clean streets, as far as practicable, and providing
good sewerage; is it, I venture to ask, wise, to look supinely on, at the destruction of the City —at
the conversion of a locality designed for a spacious and airy town, adapted to the climate, into a
mass of miserable hovels, and narrow lanes and alleys, as unsafe to the general who
have occasion to traverse them, as unhealthy and intolerable to the families doomed to reside
in such ill-contrived habitations? So true is it, that “what concerns everybody, is attended to
by nobody,” that it will be mentally replied by all, “We know this very well —the city is in
process of being cut up into alleys, and fractional building allotments, and being ruined before
our eyes; but what, can he done to prevent it ? Each owner of land in the city, has a right “to
do what he will with his oven;” —and if a man choose to build a dozen huts, upon a quarter-of-
an-acre allotment, and make a narrow road, or even a foot path between them, who can prevent


him from doing -what lie thinks most to his own advantage, how muchsoever it may be to ths
detriment of the neighbouring householders, and to the disgrace and disadvantage of the City?’’
It is not easy to reply to this objection: but perhaps the best way to do so, may be first to
reply to the question, “How may this crying evil be provided against, in the formation of future
towns and cities ?” and how might such nuisances, so discreditable to the metropolis of the
fair province of Victoria, and to the Corporation of the city of Melbourne, and so injurious to
the citizens, have been averted ? To this query I have no hesitation to reply. The allotments
as laid out by my former brother Officer, the able representative of the Surveyor-General, in the
formation of this City and district, should have been disposed of, and conveyed by the Crown
ft> the respective purchasers, subject to one condition , or reservation, only, viz;—that “ no Mes-
suage or Dwelling-house whatever, should be erected, in other situation, than fronting or
abutting on the street.” This, it was perfectly competent to the local Government to have done;
and the result of such happy stipulation, would have been, that Collins-street, Bourke-street,
and Flipders-street; Elizabeth-street, Queen-street, and Russell-strcet, etc., would have retained
handsome large gardens to each house, with the convenience of a back entrance: whilst the
minor streets or lanes, would be little used as public thoroughfares, as there would be no
buildings in them, except stables, or sheds, belonging to the houses in front, or perhaps, an
occasional warehouse, smith’s forge, or other out-building—but not any dwelling-house. It is
now too late to remedy the mischief easily, or very quickly; but having respect to the rights
of the next generation, and of posterity, as well as a just consideration for the present propri-
etors ; I cannot but think, that our Citizen Member of Council would render a service to this
Metropolis, which would entitle him to public thanks, to the blessings of posterity, and to a
statue in the centre of some square, hereafter to be formed, as formerly designed; if he were
to initiate a Bill in the Legislative Council, to the effect, that no dvvelling-honse should be
erected in any of the narrow streets, nor shall those now existing be replaced as they give way-
in their not very solid masonry,* under the hand of old Father Time: and especially to provide
that, in the extension of the Town , now in fact taking place, no dwelling-house shall be erected
except with frontage to the main street. This, would stop the evil from progressing more exten-
sively, then it has already’ done; and in about twenty or five-and-twenty years, the evil al-
ready created, would be gradually’ abated, until entirely removed. But in the laying out of
new Towns, a*d Cities too, in Australia—which will doubtless take place, much within that
period, in various localities of this immense territory’—as well as with respect to the extension of
both Melbourne and Geelong, at this moment progressing; nothing can be more important,
than the introduction and peremptory observance of such condition, in the future alienation of
the Town Allotments. There can be nothing arbitrary, or unfair, in it Each town proprietor
would be bound by’ a certain condition, for the benefit of all. Of course, compensation would
be awarded by arbitrators, to parties injuriously affected.
Ho one w-ho ever gave the subject a moment’s thought, can be surprised at what has taken
place, wholly and solely for want of such provisions being stipulated by the Government. It is
precisely that, wdiich I for one, not only expected but foretold; for, I remember on first seeing
this sketch of the intended Town of Melbourne, published in 1836; I confidently predicted,
what has now taken place—that the purchaser of each allotment, finding he had two frontages,
would build very generally, a house at each end; and as these allotments would be sure to be
divided by the purchasers; and at first, those fronting the lanes, would be most easily pur-
chased, they would in general be first built on, and the narrow streets become the greatest
thoroughfares. Such was the case at Adelaide—and thus Hindley and Bundle, though some-
w r hat narrow, and intended by Colonel Light to be secondaiy streets, were those first formed
and which became and continue, the most business streets in that now thriving City, of the
same age as this.

round ; and then to buy up the Yreehold by easy instalments yearly, ’cording
to the plan thee proposes:—l do zay this be all roight and I approves on’t
zincerely;—yet arter all, thy, or rather Mr. Wills’s zuggestion, is neither
more nor less than what one has, as I may say, a roight to look for, from “old
hands” that have been “in the Bush” I’ll be bound, many years, in most of
these here colonies, and larnt the “ ins and outs” of things, and knows what’s
what. Zuch zound practical proposals for the benefit of the colony and all
the mouths in it (aye and bellies too); also for the encouragement of the
rail cultivators of the zoil—and for the azistance of the honest and hard-
working Hem-migrant (or Him-migrant as zome calls ’em, whichever be the
correctest name—for I be no scholard), from the vanning Counties at home,
who be able and willing to plow and zow and reap, enough to veed all the people
in the colony, Towns, Gold-fields and all, without zcnding to' tother polonies
to Haymericay and even to England for bread-stuffs, etc.: this I zay is “ all
roight—quite so—but it is only exzactly what might be expected as the zound


advice and zensible zuggestions of practical “ old hands,” and as the rezults of
long experience. Zartainly I zees nothing in your letter zur, but zound prin-
ciples, based on-tirely on honesty, patriotism, and common sense, which I believes
zomebody zays:—
“ The most uncommon and most useful is, of senses ‘mongst Mankind."
But now Mr.Hawthur, having done you the honour to read through your long
letter which I blames you for not having put in the Har-gus— [Author. —lt was
sent to the Editor, but refused insertion ] —as an advertisement, I means ; he
wouldn’t ha revused it then I’ll warrant, and t’would’ ha cost thee very little
more than this pamphlet— [Author. —True, it’s a pity that bright idea never
struck me before]; then I should have zeen it long ago, and zo would all my
neighbours in the country, zeveral of whom are Honourable M.L.C.s, and
zome of ’em would have been zure to have brought it under the notice of
tothers of their colleagues, before the Council broke up—Hows’ever I hopes
you will send a copy of it to each on ’em, at their country houses, where
they’ll ha’ time to con it over, and will conzider the zubject, afore they meets
agin—“that’s my zuggestion”; because it zeems to me, to be of more con-
sekence for thy letter to be read and conzidered, and thy reasoning upon
the Land question well understood, by his Exzellency the Governor and the
Members of the Council which has the making of our laws ( and will have the
mending of ’em I hopes ), than by all the rest of the populatiou put together,
whether Marchants or Tradesvolks, Gold-vinders or Gold-zeekers, Zoldiers or
Zailors, Squatters or even Varmers ; for all of us, as good zubjects of Queen
Victoria— God bless her! and of the Colony of Victoria—God bless it too, says
I—have nothing for it, but to obey the laws, with or without grumbling, which
you know is John Bull’s privilege and pleasure: but them gentlemen as be
returned to reprezent us in the Colonial Parliament, zuch as the Honourable
member for Grant, they makes the laws, and as it is their special business
and dooty to look arter the interests of every class of the community, for the
common good of the whole, I hopes that while they takes zo much trouble
about the drones and doo-littles, they won’t forget to take zome care of the
working-bees of the hive, which have been most shockingly neglected, that’s
zartain! but that they will vollow up Mr. Horace Wills’s admirable motions
(long life to him!), and be sure to take a leaf (pp. 17, 18) out of thy book,
Zur. Then, ’t will be of zome raal zarvice to your adopted country, and to
our yellow-colonists, which I am zartain must ha’ been your arnest and
anxious desire, when you took the trouble to compoze zuch a letter on thy
hanniverzary day, which, to be zure, would be a queer zort of enjoyment, if
’t wam’t for the object you had in view, which I means to zay, and I’ll stick
to it, was a useful and a good un ; and zo zuccess to it, zur, and here’s to thy
jolly good health. Vurther, Mr. Hawthur, I begs leave respectfully and
zincerely to return thee my best thanks for thy good intentions, and volun-
tary exertions, as a colonist, to benefit our adopted country ; and I speaks


veelingly, and not vor myself only, but on behalf of a very large family I’ve
left behind me in Mother Country, Old England, many of whom are coming
out to “try their luck” at the gold-fields ; but others I shall zend for, if so be
they carries your plans out in Council, about zelling land on long credit —
binding ’em down to live on, and dig, plow, and sow it —which iz but raison-
able and right —to come out here and be Varmers of their own land in Vic-
toria.
Author. —l am glad to find that I am so fortunate as to have afforded
satisfaction to one of my intelligent readers, who so kindly, and I may
conscientiously declare, correctly, appreciates my motives, —and that one, a
gentleman of such distinguished abilities and unquestionable judgment, whose
commendation is as intoxicating as his opinion is disinterested. My name,
sir, is known to you. May I therefore be permitted to ask of my new and
agreeable acquaintance, with whom have I the honour of discussing this im'
portant and interesting subject?
Reader. —My name, zur, be one of which I ma’ never he ashamed , —one,
indeed, of which any man of any country in the whole world, may be justly
proud —and zur, my vamily is one, a very large one—well-known, zur, and
known only to be respected all over the globe, even from my vatherland to
this here, which is at t’ other side o’ the world; we be known, zur, in
general to be veared, but always to be loved.— [Author. —What illustrious
name did I understand you to say, Sir?] I be Varmer Bull, zur, at thy
sarvice; or to be more exact, my name be John Bull —a name to be
cherished by all the vriends of my vamily, and every true lover of liberty,
whether French, or Turkish, or cousins-German, especially by my three
brothers, Andrew, Taffy, and Pat; but, let me tell thee, not to he sneezed at
by our enemies, whether llooshians or any other blackguards. But, zur, —
vor Ibe a very plain man, and very plain-spoken, —I do hope youbain’t poking
vun at me, though I likes your writing or Mr. Blundell’s printing pretty well,
or I may zay, for the matter of that, pro-digiously, and would like to have
some further talk with thee about a great many things colonial, that you be
acquainted with better than I; zo, without intending anything onpleazant, I
would ha’ thee understand that I doan’t intend, by consulting with thee, that
thee shouldst putt inzult on me, about “ ’toxication,” indeed! Why I’d have
thee know, zur, that Ibe almost as good as a Tea-totaller; vor my wife be one
of that virtuous vraternity, and she be, you know, only my “ better -half.”
Author. —A thousand apologies, and as many more as you please, to my
esteemed countryman (Hampshire, I think, or Moonraker?) ; I am always
delighted to meet with a friend from the South or West of England, whom I
can tell immediately by his manly homely dialect, which has, and will ever
have, a charm for me, —the magic influence of fellowship, in connexion with
the happy associations and pleasing reminiscences of early life. But touching
the topics on which you would have me enlighten you ?


Mr. John Bull. —“ Top picks” and“ lightning” I cares nought about, not I;
although it is zartain I do hail from De Yizes in Wulkshire, and wife from
Zomerzet, zo you he roight either way ; but I he zo taken with thy zenti-
ments about the Land Question, and the Water Question too, that I should
like to hold another yam with ’ee about zeveral other matters, on which it be
my opinion, that thy long residence in.these parts, must have qualified thee to
form a tolerablish good opinion of your own, from observation ; zome of which
matters be, to my mind, but little inverior in importance to thy Questions of
Questions, —land, how to get it, and how to keep and cultivate —and vood
and how to get that cheap and plentiful within the colony; which great
questions, I will do thee the justice to say, thou hast answered very much to
my satisfaction, anyhow. But as you’ve been at the “ Diggins,” no doubt,
and upon “ Runs,” or stations, all over the colony; I should veel obliged to be
vavoured with more of thy “ notions” about such like, and things in
general. .
Author. —Good Sir, yours is a flattering and extensive order. Perhaps,
the better to enable me to fulfil the same, you will condescend to famish me
with an invoice, or bill of “particulars,” of the commodities on which my
report is desired. I will then comply with your requisition to the best of
my humble ability, seriatim ; on three conditions, however, for which I shall
stipulate.
Reader. — What are your conditions ?
Author. —That you shall not interrupt me, till you have heard me out;
2nd, that should you differ in opinion on any point (which you are at perfect
liberty to do, if conscientiously'), you shall shake hands with me at parting, as
a disclaimer of enmity, and avowal of a bona fide feeling of cordiality and
good understanding existing mutually between us (and if you are a really
good fellow, you may give us a song !) and 3rd, that you shall place to my
account at my publishers’s, No. 44, Collins-street west, a lawyer’s fee of 6s. Bd.
sterling coin of the realm, and no counterfeit; or otherwise, which will be
more satisfactory to all parties, enter your name for a copy of your (may I be
permitted to say amusing, or instructive ?) companion’s “ Australasian
Muse,” at the worthy bookseller’s aforesaid, —that is, if you have any taste
for poetry or lyrics, which, my dear Sir, I am not so rude as to doubt !
Reader. —Those being your conditions, Mr. Author, I say, “ done! that’s a
bargainand now for my catalogue. First, of course, comes Gold; then
these: —the Squatting Question, the Revenue, Customs, Salaries, &c., &c.,
Railroads and other Roads, Ship Canal to Melbourne, Incorporation Act,
Mint, and the New Constitution ; the Rifle Corps, Banks, and Miska Hauser,
and our Defences, Chinese, and Wizard of the South, Immigration—and
one or two other subjects about which I feel some curiosity, but which must,
I apprehend, be of greater interest to yourself at present, than to anybody
else, whatever may be the case hereafter.


Author. —Hold! hold! hold ! A modest request, truly I and moderate de-
mands, very ! However, in order to remove any possible doubt of my desire
to comply with the expressed wishes of my more handsome than considerate
new acquaintance, and to render myself less unworthy of the distinguished
patronage of my honoured guest, and this bagatelle better worth the sterling
pence invested in its purchase (especially when taking into consideration the
consulting fee promised on honour to he paid into the house of Blundell and
Co.), I yield a cheerful compliance; hut for the sake of convenience, I will,
with your kind permission, take only one subject at a time, beginning, if
quite agreeable to you, with that which is most nearly allied to the subject of
my rejected letter to the Argus.
Reader. —l am all attention.
Author. —You’re a Gentleman.*
THE SQUATTING QUESTION.
We [i. e., the author] must be brief [not in the lawyers’ sense of the
word,] and merely glance at the “ main points” of present interest, on each
subject of importance, or we shall tire your patience, and you will make me
hoarse [psha! I mean blind'] with talking to you. Were Ito attempt to
dilate, a small volume would not suffice, nor a few meetings, to discuss the
Political Economy of this extraordinary land of gold, wool, and dirt. Why,
the mere report of the late Government Commissioners appointed to inquire
into the squatting question—and a most able document it is—fills a folio
volume of 78 pages; and a precious hubbub it has created, as might natu-
rally be expected. But to make you, who are a “ Johnny Newcome,” under-
stand the subject, we must go back to the beginning, and I’ll give you my
notions in a very plain manner— [Bull. —Aye, that’s just what I likes, so as
a person without much headication may understand]! and in few words. In
the early days, and indeed until within the last five or ten years, I may say,
until the gold discovery, which brought hundreds of thousands to Australia
—yourself amongst the number, —the proportion between the population, or
even the live stock, and an area of 200,000,000 of acres, was so absurdly
small, that there could be no rational objection to any person possessed of
sheep or cattle, grazing them upon the unoccupied Crown lands. Stockholders
were therefore permitted and encouraged by the local Governments to occupy
the same ad libitum , and they might locate on any “ country” they chose to
“ take up,” i. e., to select to any extent, from 500 to 50,000, or even 500,000
acres each, upon payment of a registration or license fee of £lO per annum.
* Unless * Lady. — Printer's Devil.


The system, though not unexceptionable, was on the whole a good system
under the circumstances ; and under its fostering influence, flocks and herds
have multiplied in a ratio almost incredible; and notwithstanding the won-
derfully increased consumption, have spread over the length and breadth
of each and all of the Australian colonies, to the advantage of the entire
population. The squatters in general have realised, as they deserved to do
(I allude principally to the early and enterprising pioneers of the hush and of
civilisation), handsome fortunes; nevertheless it is obvious that the towns-
people and every mutton and Beef-eater in the colony, owe the Squatter a
debt of gratitude.
These waste lands of the Crown, which have been occupied on “ sufferance”
only, were always known and perfectly understood by the owners of the
flocks and herds grazing on them, to be liable to be withdrawn to any extent
that might be required, for sale, for settlement and cultivation, or for any
other purpose, at the discretion of the Government. But such withdrawal
was little or not at all apprehended, especially in the remote interior; and
the squatters applied to have “ leases” granted them of their “ runs,” w'hich
they alleged, with much reason, would, by giving them confidence of undis-
turbed possession for a certain number of years, induce many of them to erect
better dwellings both for themselves and their servants, and to effect perma-
nent improvements at a considerable outlay of capital, which, while adding
to the comforts of the denizens of the bush in general, would have a tendency
to settle, improve, and open-up the country.
About eight or ten years ago, a general outcry for “leases” gave rise to
new regulations issued by the Queen in Council; and in 1848-50, every person
that could use a land-chain and theodolite was put in requisition to survey
the “ runs” and send in to the Government rough-plans of the whole of New
South Wales, in which colony Victoria was at that time included, as the.
district of “ Port Phillip,”—it being palpable that a description, however
loose, must be furnished, before a lease of any “ run” could be prepared ; and
commissioners were appointed to determine disputed boundaries. The leases
which were meditated, of “ eight years” in the settled, and “ fourteen years”
in the remote or unsettled districts, however, have not been issued; and now
the entire Land Question of this colony of Victoria (and it is presumable that
of N. S. Wales will be dealt with in the same manner), is about to be revised,
—the whole ot the waste lands, and all the gold and other metals within its
bowels, having been, with astounding liberality, given up absolutely by the
Crown to the colonists, the occupation of Crown Lands, or the “ Squatting
Question,” is necessarily one of the most important subjects that can be dis-
cussed, of the many that just now agitate this community.
Notwithstanding the odium which the squatters have of late years drawn
upon themselves, by the rapacity of their intentions and assumptions in their
collective capacity as a class, as enunciated by their champions, in and out of


the Legislative Council, and chiefly by their monstrously absurd pretension
to large compensation for the remainder of their alleged “ rights” and interests,
with respect to the domains of the Crown which they have overrun with their
flocks and herds on sufferance , so long, that many of them assume to believe,
and some few may be so ignorant as well as grasping, as to have actually
persuaded themselves, that the great length of time they have been permitted
to enjoy, and by the Government regulations protected in the enjoyment of
their runs as annual licensees , gives them an equitable right fqy., for themselves
and their heirs for ever?) to continue in the enjoyment of the same
“ License,” to occupy their princely “ runs,” now that the colony is populated
by hundreds of thousands, and rapidly increasing in numbers, —now that tens
of thousands of their fellow-subjects, whose claims are much stronger (their
rights being equal to those of the squatters, who have been so long and so
greatly favoured), are all anxiously asking of their Sovereign and her repre-
sentative in the colony, to let them participate in H. M. munificent disposition
of the Crown Lands, —who are loyal subjects, also resident in the colony, and
desirous to do all that was expected of the first and present race of squatters,
viz., to breed sheep and cattle on the natural pastures; but who propose to
do much more , viz., to pay to the Crown a larger license-fee for one square
mile, than has hitherto been paid for ten, fifty, or a hundred square miles,
viz., £lO per annum; and express their willingness to do much more than
that, viz., to pay such moderate “ Rent," for the occupation of the waste lands
of the Crown, and in moderate quantities, as mag be decided by their repre-
sentatives in the Legislature, to ha just and reasonable : which rent, to arise
from 60,000,000 acres, when all located, cannot possibly be estimated at less
than ten millions per annum (for by that time, land will have vastly increased
in value in every locality), but might be made immediately productive of one
or two millions, not only without injury to any, but with the very greatest
imaginable amount of benefit to a multitude of worthy and deserving persons
at present proscribed from any participation in the natural advantages of a
country possessing “ commonage,” of boundless extent, monopolised by the
handful of gentlemen whose singular good fortune it has been to arrive in the
early and palmy days of Australian colonisation. Notwithstanding the odium
which the selfishness of grasping monopolists, and the unanswerable argument
by which their policy and their position, as unjustly favoured monopolists,
are denounced by their uncompromising political foe —the able, honest, and
independent Member for Talbot; there can be no doubt that the private senti-
ments of the Squatters, (as conscientiously felt, and privately or separately
admitted by them, almost to a man), are, as was very plainly stated in an
able letter to the Argus some six years ago, by the late Ed. Curr, Esq.,
of St. Heliers, that they are perfectly aware of their liability to relinquish
their runs, or any portions of them, the moment they may be required for sale
or purchase,—for cultivation and occupation, as purchased land, —and all they


asked, and the utmost they hoped, was permission to occupy as they were
then doing, till such occasion should arise. Now, such time has arrived, and
such occasion has arisen, long since; for no sane man, will have the effrontery
to contend, that the circumstances of this colony are the same now, with
300,000 inhabitants, augmenting daily, as was the case when the “runs,” into
which the whole territory is divided, were taken up (principally 10 or 15 years
ago), when not a person in the colony possessing the smallest flock of sheep,
or a few head of cattle, was precluded from taking up a run, if he would hut
take the trouble to fix upon any “ country,” not offensively near to, i. e., not
within a day’s ride of any previously licensed Squatter. Well, the claims of
the aristocracy of Crown Land agistment, now in occupation of the small
extent of 60,000,000 of acres in this colony (or if not of the entire Crown
Lands—of the whole of the cream, and of all but such insignificant proportion
as they have left untouched, because only rateable as skim-milk), stand at
the enormous rent—with which Mr. J. P. Fawkner delights to twit them —-of a
quarter of a farthing per acre! which is about the fact; and with the vast
addition of the assessment of £d. per sheep, and 1 |d. per head of horned
cattle (to which they most magnanimously submitted, I believe even volun-
tarily proposed, some years ago, on condition that the same should be expended
on a Bush Mounted Police for their protection, in their isolated domains all
over the colony (and of which force, the Black Police was the cheapest, most
efficacious, and most valuable to the denizens of the bush, as well as affording
a philanthropic and patriotic mode of employing and civilising the poor,
miserable, and now discarded aborigines); this self-imposed burthen increases
the Squatters’ liability, as a gross total, for rent and taxes, to the handsome
figures of about £-003, or of a penny about -876 ; but I will not pledge myself
to a fraction, but, allowing a wide margin , say somewhat less than a penny
per acre.
I observe the smile of astonishment, bordering on incredulity, on your
good-humoured countenance, Mr. Bull; and you’may well ask'what compens-
ation a squatter can expect, or what, for , when the “ run” he has so long
been permitted to occupy, or any portion of it, may be required for use by
the owner ; but, don’t you see ? tbe case is this, —the Squatter says, I took up
my run in 1840, and stocked it with a flock of 1,000 ewes (purchased at one
or two shillings per head!) I have taken care of it ever since, and, besides
sending into the market an average of 1,000 fat sheep (at 20s. or 30s. a head)
for the benefit of the diggers and townspeople, for the last seven years, and
sundry bales of wool and tons of fat, for the benefit of the people at home, —
having, by my industry and perseverance, benefitted the colony, and (whilst
making a handsome fortune for myself, certainly, as I deserved to do), having
increased the stock now upon my run to 20,000 sheep, and upwards of 1,000
head of cattle, besides horses, and built a good stone house, as well as large
woolsheds, etc., it does seem a hard case, that I should be disturbed by the


Government, and their new-fangled regulations, in the enjoyment of my
property ! Have n’t I made it what it is ? then, I wonder who has a greater
right to it! and what would it he now, if it had n’t been for me ?—a wild
desert, occupied by the kangaroo and emu, by the wild dog, and perhaps by a
small tribe of black-fellows, as wild as either! If, then, the Government
choose to take my run, with all its present advantages,—whether for their
own benefit, or somebody else’s, makes no difference to me; of course not!—
I ask, have they not a right to pay me, for what I may call “my good-will
interest, the same as any other person perhaps some Johnny Newcome, —
would do ? Why, I could sell my good-will of the run to-morrow for £5,000:
I mean to say it is cheap at that figure, to any one—of course I mean the
transfer of my lease, that is, “ license,” without the stock. Well, what is it?
why, a compact block of country, not so large as ******’s by one-half,
it’s true; but then it’s often times better quality, and being just 20 miles
each side (and the river is the longest side; but the surveyor calls it, by the
chain, taking all the bends of the river, and both creeks, at pretty nearly 100
miles round the boundaries), which is easily calculated at just “400 miles;”
but I think id, acres it is a trifle more, or close on three hundred \_Mr. Bull. —
Man alive! 300 acres ! why, my varm in Barkshire, which is less than vour
miles in circumference, contains upwards of vive hundred acres !] Author. —
“ Three hundred thousand ,” I was going on to say, Mr. Bull, if you had not
“ shut me up” with your exclamation [Mr. Bull. —Beg pardon, zur.J Author. —
No apology is necessary, for your surprise is quite natural: —“we,” that is, the
squatters, “ do not speak of the areas of runs in this country, by the acre, but
by the thousand of acres; or more frequently by the mile, which, as you are
aware, contains 640 acres ; so that this Run, if a true square of 20 miles, would
contain 256,000 acres, but the boundaries not being all straight lines, are likely
to include some odd 40,000 or 50,000 acres more, rather than short of this
quantity.” But to continue, my squatter friend’s observations : —“ The longest
side is along the river and creek, which together give 40 miles water frontage;
and I am well aware that I can divide my country into three or four splendid
grazing stations, of say from 50,000 to 60,000 acres each ; and I want to know
who would mind giving a couple of thousand pounds for either of them, as
things now are, when sheep readily fetch £l, that would not, in former times,
have brought a dollar ? Then, there is one little corner, the Government
people have pitched upon for a Township,—about a mile or 1,000 acres, I
think it is, and certainly of the very best of my land, —why, they expect it
will sell at £lO, and some £2O, for half-acre allotments; then why should not
they pay me liberally for giving it up, as it is certain the public, and especially
the publicans , are fools enough to pay them such long prices for it ?It is
true that the new township, will make my station of three times the value it
was before, by bringing a population, and all the conveniences of a town and
police, near to me, and a market at my very door, to give me double the price


on the spot, for my sheep and cattle, that I could have got for them in Mel-
bourne and Geelong, after driving them 200 miles; but what has anybody to
do with that, but me ? Again, it may be maliciously observed, that I pay two
license-fees only, viz., £2O a year for the Eun ; that’s true enough ; and that
the corner they have taken off is but a fraction, a 50th, or 300th, or 500th
part of the whole, —which is also true: but what of that? If I can prove—
and that I both can and will —that the 1,000 acres they are taking away from
me, is as good as water-meadow, the part I can best depend on, out of all
my country of four or five hundred square miles; and that from this very spot
I have been in the habit of clearing at least £SOO a-year, for the last thirteen
or fourteen years, that is, from the very first year that I took up this country;
if I can prove this—which I can, by my overseer and by my books too —I
wonder what jury would give me less than two or three years’ loss of average
profit, as a just and reasonable compensation , in equity , for the “ abstraction ” of
that bit of my run, —say one or two thousand pounds !”
But this subject is laid before the British readers of the Argus, in so lucid
a manner, by the talented editor of that deservedly influential journal, in its
summary of colonial affairs, of this date, July 20, 1855, for the “Marco Polo,”
that I cannot do better than read it to you; merely observing that I cannot
bring myself to believe that the Squatters, who have made a demonstration by
their “hundreds,” will have the temerity to attempt seriously, to appeal to the
Crown, through the Court of Chancery, on a question now to be sent back to
the Legislature for adjudication in the colony, to whom the Crown has con-
ceded its right to the waste lands ; but they will have the wisdom—knowing
“ discretion to be the better part of valour” —to adopt the sound and sensible
views enunciated at their late meeting by Dr. Murphy, M.L.C.
“ The occupants of Crown lands, or “ the squatters,” to use their more
familiar name, have been thrown into the greatest consternation by the report
of the Commission of Inquiry into the “ squatting question,”—that is to say,
into the rights of the Squatters, the laws affecting their tenure of their runs,
etc. This Keport indeed does, we think, deal-out somewhat hard measure
to them. Their legal title may be exceedingly defective, and they assuredly
deserve little favour or affection from society, after the selfish stand they
have always made upon their supposed rights, and their recklessness as to
how much injury the colony at large sustained, provided they could secure
the least personal advantage. But we think they have acquired certain
equitable claims that have, in fact, been always admitted by all classes ; and
on the faith of which, other members of society have never hesitated to
purchase Squatters’ runs. The commission has reported very much to the
effect that the Squatters have no title to their runs; and has altogether omitted
to consider the question of “ compensation.” We believe the general spirit
of fair play, throughout the community, would have been most satisfied by a
declaration that the squatters should not be permitted to be obstacles to


progress, as they have been ; but that even they, should not be turned out
of their runs, and deprived of all benefit from a contract which both parties
thought to be, to some extent at least, valid, without any compensation
whatever.
“ The Squatters, have, however, taken what appears to us to be a most
injudicious course. On the 26th ult., they held a meeting, at which they
violently denounced the Government, the Commission, the Report, and all
concerned with it, and resolved to throw the whole question of the public
lands into Chancery ! If the sales of land could be arrrested, they fancy that
Government and people together would be only too glad to entertain the
question of due “ compensation.” The evil to the colony of such a suspension
of land sales is, of course, a minor consideration with gentlemen who never
trouble themselves with any misgivings of this kind.
“In pursuance of this design a number of Squatters put down a hundred
pounds a-piece, towards the payment of legal expenses ; and altogether this
impoverished class has resolved to spend L. 5,000 in fees to lawyers, for fighting
the squatting cause. The Squatters mean to appeal from the local Courts to
the Lord Chancellor, the Privy Council, the House of Lords, —any tribunal
they can think of, which, if it will not gain them their case, will at least gain
them time, inconvenience the colony, and so force the Government and
Legislature into a compromise. Their claim, in the way of compensation
one of their leaders has already stated at two millions sterling ! Their present
position is certainly a most ungracious one. They stand confessed as building
their hopes, on the mischief they cau do their country by causing delay in the
sale of Crown lands. Their position is precisely analogous to that of those
Italian and Spanish brigands who extort money, for immunity from torture.
They fancy they have it in their power to inflict a serious injury,—they know
their reputation too well to doubt the acceptance of their assertion that they
will do that injury if not bought off,—thus they make capital of their cruelty,
and we may be sure will be as cruel as they promise, if only to avoid diminu-
tion of that capital. We do not doubt they will carry out their threat, but
they play a dangerous game when, with questionable legal rights, they array
themselves against the feeling of all the rest of society. The Gordian knot
with which they hope they have tied up the lands of the colony, may,
perchance, be rudely cut through ; having thrown themselves upon the law
courts, defied the public, and cast away all considerations of abstract right,
they need expect neither pity nor mercy if their legal quibbles fail them.
They demand justice and their “pound of flesh,” and may learn yet to attach
a new meaning to the words of Portia, “ Thou shalt have justice more than
thou demandest.”
I see you are growing fidgetty and impatient, my dear Mr. Bull, for the
upshot of this long yarn ; so I ’ll cut it short. Well, in conversation with my
squatting friends, and many of them are nice fellows in every sense of the


word [Mr. Bull.— May I be allowed to except one,—selfishness ?] or perhaps
I may be constrained by you and by conscience to say, with one small excep-
tion [Mr. Bull. —Say large exception, if you please, zur;] well, with one
exception—(which exception, however, I believe to be common to all other
persons, of even' class and name whatever, viz., loving themselves the best of
all their mother’s children, and each taking all the care he can of himseZ/’),
observations to the above effect have been repeatedly addressed to me.
Mr. John Bull. —And how did you, or would you reply ?
Author. —Thus : a friend of mine of great wealth and extremely generous
and kind, having a mansion and extensive grounds unoccupied, upon the
solicitation of several poor but respectable neighbours, to allow them to live
on the premises, and promising that they would take every care of the same
for him, till he should have occasion to reside on, or procure a good tenant
for, the estate—readily gave them his permission ; requiring nothing of them
more than to protect the property from malicious injury, but pay to him a
quit-rent of a peppercorn by way of an acknowledgment—This permissory
occupation, continued many years. At last, the Landlord was applied to by a
good and desirable tenant, to grant him a lease of his estate, for which he was
willing to pay a resonable rent; on which occasion, the owner sent for the
poor people whom he had so long and so kindly allowed the use of his house
and grounds, and was quite delighted to see how much improved they all
were in apperance —proving not only, that the Country was “salubrious,”
but fertile, as by its produce they had so much improved their circumstances
as to be hearty and hilarious, with plenty of money in their pockets, and in
general well mounted, with abundance of beard and moustache. He then
addressed them, —“My good friends, I am thankful to have been enabled to
afford you a home for so many years, and am rejoiced to find you have made, in
and by it, so good a living, and have so greatly improved your circumstances,
so that it will not occasion you any distress —and I regret if it should, even the
slightest inconvenience—to surrender it up to me, now that I have at length
met with a tenant, in whom I hope you will also find a friend and neighbour
and some of you an employer, and a good customer.” Well, what do you
think ?—if you were not acquainted with the failing, the great and general
failing of poor human nature, you would not believe it! —the ungrateful
blackguards burst out into one roar of laughter, and asked the governor; some,
whether he wms serious ? —others, if he were not joking ? Some were serious,
—some, facetious —all, were exulting. Some said, they would not give up
possession, of that, to which length of occupation had given them a right—
others, said they defied him to take possession or to eject them,—others,
actually said they had a claim on him for so long residing upon and taking care
of the place for themselves : and they all drowned his voice in their hypro-
critical clamour about “equity ;” but the climax was this, a popular move-
ment, amongst these tenants-at-will, or tenants-on-suferancc, to subscribe


L.IOO each, to the extent of five or ten thousand pounds, to fee sundry
lawyers, to bring an action against the worthy owner of the estate, for com-
pensation to them, in money, equivalent to the value of the accommodation
he had so long afforded them, but now dared to think of discontinuing.
Mr. Bull. —And what, Sir, was the result ?
Author. —The “ result” remains to he seen : but I tell you, in confidence,
that I have my opinion on the subject—but that’s a secret.
Mr. Bull. —That information is mighty great, truly; but no doubt thee hast
thine own opinion how these Sqatters ought to be dealt with now, in framing
new land regulations, which, of course, ought to be alike for thee, or me, or
them. What plan dost think would be just and right, and vair vor all ?
Author. —The subject, you see, Mr. Bull, is rather complicated; and no
sweeping law applying to all licenses alike, such as has been proposed, for
instance, of “ letting every Run by auction or by tender, to the highest bid-
der,” would be qually fair to persons who may be very differently circum-
stanced, with respect to the “ price or no price,” paid for their licenses, respect-
ively. Each claim, or each case, should be decided in an equitable manner
on its oivn merits: but as it would be out of the question, to hold an Arbi-
tration Commission on each of twelve or fifteen hundred Runs ; my idea is,
that some general principles should be laid down for the guidance of the
Executive, and chiefly this: that just as a promissory note must be paid if
held by a third party who has taken it as money; which might be resisted in
the hands of the drawer: so the holder of a Run, the right of which he pur-
chased for a valuable, and it may be for a large consideration, under regula-
tions from which he had reasonable grounds to believe, that he would not be
interrupted, but should he confirmed in possession, by the Government, should
be allowed a moderate compensation if dispossessed ; which allowance should
come from the pocket of the party by whom he may be superseded in his
Pastoral Domain; but that the occupier of a Run obtained by himself from
the Crown direct, and for which he has paid no more than his annual license
fee and agistment assessment, shall receive only what he is entitled to—
viz., nothing. I would advocate a sliding scale, so that if a person be obliged
to relinquish a Run which he purchased within the last twelve months, he
shall be entitled to so much —say 50 per cent, of the sum which it may be
fairly computed that he gave for the transfer of the same, over and above
what would have been a fair price for the Stock without the Station; if
within the last two years, 40 per cent. ;if four years, 20; and if within five
years, 10 per cent. Something of this kind, I conceive, would meet the
equity of the case, as to “ compensation ;” but regulations should be immedi-
ately made to break up the monopoly, and to prevent the possibility of any
Squatter retaining, or any person obtaining possession, on any terms what-
ever hut purchase, of ten times as much land as is necessary for his stock, to
the exclusion of his fellow-colonists, who may desire to rent and occupy a


portion of the same, which is the case at present; and in order to discourage,
as far as practicable, the detestable spirit of monopoly, I would have the
rent fixed on a sliding scale: so much for the first thousand acres, with a
gradual increase of 10 per cent, on the second thousand, 20 per cent, on the
third, and so on. Few persons would then, grasp at a million or even one
hundred thousand acres (which is by no means a large Run at present)
without being able to make the slightest use of one-fourth or perhaps even a
tenth of their Ducal Domain.
Mr. Bull. —Well—well. I be well pleased with thy “ notions” on this
great Squatting Question, as well as on thy “ Question of Questions,” from
which this aint var removed ; indeed, I believe, it vorms part of the Zubject,
“not the smallest part” neither, be it ? I can only zay vurther, that ye have
my thanks and happrobation, on-tirely ; and I thinks you dezarves the zame
from every Squatter if he be a raisonable man ; and from every Hem, or Him-
migrant (which be right of them two words ?) that has a mind to become a
Squatter. I always laughs when I uses that ere word—it makes me think of
a zong I larnt on board ship, that was made by a young man on the voyage to
Adelaide. He was a Countryman of oum from Zomerztshir.
Author. —-I am excessively fond of a song,, and you excite my curiosity
i greatly Mr. Bull ; I hope, therefore, as you have drawn out of me a long yarn,
you will allow me the pleasure to draw upon you for your Australian Immi-
grant’s Song.
Mr. Bull. —Zur, I always zays “ Who sings the wust, should zing the fust,”
Zo to oblige you, here goes : —but before I start, I must make my “condi-
tions.”
Author. —What are they, Mr. Bull?—Happy to comply with any reasonable
wish that can be expressed, by my hearty and respected friend John Bull.
Mr. Bull. —Then, Mr. Hawther, you be in for’t three ways—fust, thee
must zing a Zong arter mine (and as I ’spect thee of being a bit of a Poet, if
it be of thine own making, it ’ll be all the more pleasing and the more obleeg-
ing!) but that be last of the “ three conditions” ; and secondly, thee must
promise to join (and zo must every body else present, or I ’ll deem qiyself
grossly ’nsulted) in my jolly old chorus—(Oh, my! did n’t the zailors roar
it out merrily ; thee must have heard ’em ashore from off the Line, a’most);
and t’other, which is the fust condition, is this—that • you must drink a glass
of grog —unless so be you’d greatly 'prefer the same quantity of zalt and water—
will you agree ?
Author. —Hard conditions, Mr. Bull ;
Here’s to your health, the glass is full.
Mr. Bull. —Now dang it all, thee canst make rhyme*.
Author.— Alas ! ’t is true : such are my crimes—
Mr. Bull. —Now bless us all. I’ll take my fling—
To stop thy rhymes, at once I’ll zing.

About the Pop-ulation—

I ’ll tell all the ins and outs
Of Him and Hem-migration.
In England I liv’d in a Town,
The prattiest in the Nation ;
But many volks of late came down
To mend the Pop-ulation;
And one of them a Mr. Prown
Made sich a lam’d oration,
That he would all our wishes crown
By means of Hem-migration.
He told us all that he was v *zure
Volks had outgrown the Nation ;
And nothing could the evil cure
But a brisk Hem-migration;
He was most anxious to improve
The comforts of the Nation ;
And zo he told one-half to move
By means of Hem-migration.
No longer to Haymericay,
Said he in his relation,
Nor yet indeed to Bot’ny Bay
Would he lead Hem-migration
But to remove away the ills
Of a large population,
He had prepared some Golden Pills,
And these were Hem-migration.
“Go now my Lads, and Lassses too,
Away from this old Nation,
Unto a viner land and new,
In want of Population.
If now good Volks you’d like to hear,

And now I’m here, alas ! how dear,

Ma’nt understand the ins and outs

For He, no doubt, they uses Him,
And calls it Him-migration,
And ’case the Shes ’most always hem,

Author. —Mr. John Bull, or with the correction “ John Bull, Esquire,” your
health and song ; and on behalf of this honourable company present, I beg
leave to return you many thanks for the song amusing, of your choosing, and
for the highly intellectual treat you have afforded to your delighted audience.
The ideas of your facetious and merry shipmate, are not bad; but may I be
permitted to doubt the words being “ original ?” Is it quite impossible that I
heard them sung in Adelaide some thirteen or fourteen years ago ? or, that I
met with them in a “ Bush Book,” a year or two later, in Hobart Town ?
Mr. Bull (rather excited and excitable). —Zur, do you mean to doubt my
weracity I
Author. —Oh, that is unquestionable—“ Touch my honour , touch my life.”
Mr. Bull. —Why, truly, Zur, that’s it. You did n’t perhaps know that my
son—one of my own sons, zur, be a poet. Is n’t he, that’s all ? and did n’t
1 zee and hear him compose it on board ship ? Now, zur, what do you zay
to that ?
Author. —Oh ! that’s a plumper, and no mistake.
Mr. Bull. —I’m glad that you be convinced you wur mistaken: and now
if you please, zur, we ’ll have the third condition of our agreement; you have
joined in right jolly in my song chorus, that I will zay, just as if you had
been used to it —you’ve toss’d off your “ nobbler”'of salt and water, or grog
(which wor it ?) and now we ’re all waiting for your zong.
Author. —Well, friend Bull, and gentlemen all, as this is, or rather'yester-
day was, “ Separation Day,” which we are now celebrating (Monday, Julv 2,
1855), I’ll tip you a stave that was written and published in Melbourne
expressly on the great and glorious occasion of the, erection of this former depend-
ency of New South Wales, as Port Phillip, into the independent Colmiy it now is,
which original Separation-day was nobly celebrated, by swearing-in His Excel-


lency, the late Superintendent, Charles Joseph LaTrobe, as the first Governor
of Victoria: by the Proclamation of Independence— from New South Wales,
I mean —(and breaking half the windows in the Government offices, in firing
the salute close to the House, in the court-yard I) and by,the greatest procession
ever witnessed in Melbourne, in the formal opening of Prince’s Bridge-—illumi-
nation, bonfires on all the hills, etc., this time four years; and of which song
it may be observed, that “many a true word is” sung sometimes, as well as
often “spoken, in jest and calling upon you again, Victorians all, for a
hearty cheer:—
SEPARATION.
[A thoroughly Colonial Anthem, with Chorus to he swig hy every man, woman,
and child in “ Victoria,” in celebration of the joyful event of Port Phillip
being erected into an independent British Colony, separated from New
South Wales, under the Royal and auspicious designation conferred on the
entire Province of Australia Felix, henceforth “ Victoria.”]
(respectfully inscribed to the rejoicings’ committee.;
Air. —The Coronation.
God bless Old England’s much-loved Queen —
Long last her coronation ;
If e’er Jher Enemy be seen,
He shall make reparation!
Victoria hail—Australia’s Queen !
Hail, land of immigration!
No thought our joy shall intervene —
Huzza ? for Separation !
Ri tooral, looral, looral 100,
Hi tooral, looral, lido-
Ri tooral, looral, looral loo —
Hi tooral, looral lido.
Not from our Sovereign —bless the Queen! —
Have we sought Separation ; .
But from the rogues, to whom we’ve been
Long under sequestration;—
The rogues of New South Wales, I mean,
Who to our consternation,
Have fattened on our spoils, I ween—
Huzza / for Separation !
Ri tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
We ’re loyal subjects—bless the Queen !
She will grant reparation,
To Squatters in her Province green,
Rejoiced at Separation.


Victoria is Victoria's Queen!
A joyful declaration, —
Our love, nought e’er shall come between !
Huzza / for Separation !
Three cheers for Britain, and her Queen,
With joyful acclamation!
And thrice three cheers, or cheers thirteen,
For rightful demarcation.
Cheers for Australia’s Empress Queen ,
Who’s held in adoration,
By loyal subjects,.who all lean
On her, and Separation !
The Sydney coves have prigged our gold,
For the last generation ;
They’ve prigged so much, it can’t he told !
To honour’s desecration :
But no more plunder’s theirs ! behold
The joyous declaration—
“ Victoria” new, from Sydney old,
Has glorious Separation !
Our Mayors and Councillors rejoice—
Each trusty Corporation !
Our new M.P.’s all with one voice,
Make a Stentor-oration —
As Britons, Colonists, and Friends,
Our heart-felt approbation,
With love of Country, fondly blends
In one word — Separation !
Queen op the Isles ! of Ocean’s throne !
Hail a new Coronation!
Victoria’s Sons, are all your own !
The Sons of a new Nation !
Our loyalty and love be shown,
By just co-operation.
Victoria’s Queen, Victoria’s known ;
Huzza I for Separation !
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.


Our joy we ’ll vent this glorious day—
The day of Separation
From greedy elves of “ Botany Bay,”
Long held in detestation !
Long live Lord Russell and Earl Grey !
Their noble appellation,
Be ever honoured on this day
Of glorious Separation !
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
From Britain’s Ride, and Britain’s Queen,
W(; wish no separation !
For past injustice, it is seen,
We ask slight reparation !
In grateful joy, our pastures green,
With notes of preparation,
Resound all shout “ Gor> save the Queen
Who gave us Separation !”
Hi tooral, looral, looral 100, &c.
This is our joyful Jubilee !
It needs no peroration,
To let folks see, we all agree,
In Freedom’s free oration.
From age to age, both grave and gay,
In blest commemoration
Of glorious work, shall hail this day —
The day of SEPARATION ! ! !

Ah me! I thought, I only sought
A gentle, handsome, manly youth ;

[A conversation here takes place, of a most interesting, extraordinary, and supernatural
character (which the amiable and intellectual and delighted reader is allowed the privilege
of deriving from his own naturally exalted and supernatural imagination), carried on rather
mysteriously, in a score or more of languages, between various personages of all the sexes,
some human, some inhuman, some sub, and some super natural: amongst which the
euphonious dialects of the Welsh and German, the Chinese and aboriginal Australian,
are delightfully predominant ; and the subjects of their various vocal, oratorical, sonorous
metrical, and overwhelming orations and declamations, are to be thought of, not talked of.
The anxious iquirer is therefore referred to the great “ Wizard of the South,” who is
supposed to be the best authority, and is more than suspected of being the veritable ventrilo-
quising author of the sublime and ideal—what ?—Aye ; that’s the question !

glyphics of certain Peers and Members of Parliament, and some few illustrious personages

admits that he is. The illegibility of Mr. Bull’s autograph leaving the animus , together with
the orthography, in a state of “ glorious uncertainty,” he has given Mr. Bull the benefit
of the doubt, and as good-humourodly submita to the pleasantry of his sleepy friend

be practising [and hope to make a decidedly good hit —for a dinner; asidd]

quent than I could wish—according to my humble talents, drawn out by ad-
miration of your great virtues, etc. And now I pause, Sir, for a moment, to—•


Author. —Ah, do ! that’s a good fellow; that’s what I have been trying to
make you do the last half-hour, and hoping you’d soon be wound-up and out
of breath, with ringing my praises in my ears till they tingle quite distress-
ingly, from the fact, that I am sincerely of opinion, with the Poet, that
“ Praise, undeserved, is censure in disguise.”
But I have further had in mind, the whole time, whilst compelled to listen to
your flowery oration (for which, in token of my acknowledgments, I make you
a low bow), that talking is the trade of a paid advocate, and I have been
wondering whether you had not bathed in the Lake of Killamey, and kissed
the nate stone of St. Blarney; it further struck me forcibly, most “ learned
friend,” that your name is—l rather think, Sir—is it not—
“ Gammon ,” Sir, at your service.
Author. —Exactly so !
Mr. John Bull. —Sir Hawther, now, as you be chairman in this your own
Study, or “ Studio,” or “ Sanctum,” I believes they calls this book-room of
yourn, I makes so bold as to call upon you, to call upon our new acquain-
tance in wig and gown, to come down with a zong, vor I hears you call ’n a
“ lamed gentleman,” and in speechifying he do “pitch it zo exceeding strong,”
that I veels zartin “he’s all there and arter giving us zucha tough yarn or
horation, I thinks you calls it, well able to tune up a vine zong. I ’ll do my
best to encourage ’n with a toorle loorle, as you knows I *ve a tolerable strong
base voice, for a chorus —ha’ n’t I, Zur ?
Gammon. —l cannot sing, asl’ma sinner,
Till after I have had my dinner.
Mr. Bull. —l proposes, then, gentlemen, if so be your both agreeable, I’ll
take a smoke with one on ye, whilst t’ other gives us a yarn. Mr. Gammon,
will thee take a cigar ? I smokes my pipe.
Gammon. —Thanks, Mr. Bull, ’t is my delight: I patronise the weed ex-
tensively.
Author.— For my part I disapprove of smoking, and detest the weed ; and
therefore I wholly eschew it.
Bull. —Thee chews it, Zur, do ’ee? here’s some nigger-head for thee:
Ibe zorry’t aint pig-tail.
Gammon. —Bull, our distinguished friend and entertainer ! doth not enter-
tain even the thought of smoking, still less of chewing; so we must be
content to smoke without him.
Bull. —Tut, man-alive, dost mean to contradict me thus? and that,
too, before the very man—the gentleman I means, hisself? [To Author] —
Did n’t thee zay thee chews ?
Author. —l can’t deny I said, “I chews”; but then it was es-chews I said;
Admitted this, still I refuse, to chew aught else but meat or bread.
Bull. —Hawther and Lawyer, now you both means “ gammon
Be not zalt fish a proper name for Zammnn?


Gammon. —We will not argue on this knotty point, hut will refer it to the
arbitration of either Johnson, Sheridan, or Walker.
Bull.— T is true I be no scholard ; and I be glad to vind I be mistaken
as to the chewing part of the business; and if so he eschewing doant
mean eating of the nigger-head, I begs leave to propose that whilst thou and
I enjoys our smoak, our es-chewing friend favour us with a yarn, upon one or
other of the zubjects which he has not yet disposed of, hut is under an obli-
gation to give me his val’ed opinion on; for I holds his promise on honour.
Author —(bowing a compliance as gracious as graceful, and precisely as
graceful as gracious, and looking inquiringly over his notes) :
THE WAR IN EUROPE.
Touching the War with Russia which, humanly speaking, is admitted to
have been rendered justly necessary, for the protection of our ally, and for
preserviug the balance of power in Europe from violation; whilst I am of
opinion that the miserably meagre contributions to the “patriotic fund,” by this
richest of British colonies —a Province, too, that is exempt from any conscrip-
tion of men to join the army now fighting the battles of our country, is most
disgraceful to Victoria; I am, and ever have been, of opinion, that it is the
bounden duty of England, and of every Government, to make ample provision,
from the Public Revenue, for the wounded soldiers, and the widows and
orphans of those whose fate it may be to perish on the battle-field: —not only
so, but men who expose their lives to dangers so imminent, as do the
soldier and the sailor in War, ought to be very very much better paid than
they are ; and ought to be paid double, instead of half, the amount of wages
current for ordinary employment, unattended with danger, or removal from
country and from home. This matter is worthy of the powers of our most
able, philanthropic, and patriotic Legislators, in both Houses of Parliament,
and in each and every Provincial Legislature. Would that I had influence
in order to bring it to bear on this sadly unheeded subject. All honour
to Miss Nightingale, and her angelic sisters ministering to the wounded
heroes at Sebastopol; and all honour to Miss Catherine Hayes, and the brave
soldiers’ friends here, the Amateurs, the Clergy, and other Contributors to
the fund for the widows and orphans.
[Here an unaccountable “ hole in the ballad,” or “ fracture in the yarn,” leaves the
Publisher in a state of as “ glorious uncertainty” as would a suit in Chancery; and affords
to the imaginative and discerning Reader, the privilege of disposing of our illustrious
friends, the Author, and Mr. John Bull, with their learned guest Mr. Gammon, in whatever
way may be most satisfactory to said Reader, and agreeable to this distinguished trio.
On this matter, and as to the manner in which those illustrious heroes beguiled the
midnight hours, we (i.e. Editor) have our private opinion, which the Reader is at perfect
liberty to guess. The M.S.. evidently relating to the following day, proceed* thus :—]


Author. —Hallo ! “ Stop that knocking—stop that knocking—stop that
knocking at the door!” Who can that be, thundering on my knocker like a
Lord Mayor’s state coachman ? It must be some person of importance.
Haste, Sprightly, haste, and ope the door.
Servant. —Please, Sir, it was your old friend, Master John Bull, making such
a terrible knocking at the door ; and I s’pose he was rapping for all the people
along with him—a rare lot of ’em, which he calls a rat-in-you —but real gen-
tlemen they all seems to be —quite the “ nobs,” like, of the City and of the
Colony. They are all coming two and two, procession-like, with Mr. Bull at
their head ; but here he comes, and his tail after him; but this first gentleman
says he is Mi - . Reputation and M.L.C.
Mr. Deputatio/i, Sen., M.L.C. —Beg pardon. Sir; but when I acquaint you
that in thus intruding, it is in performance of a duty which it will be no less
agreeable to you to be informed of, than to myself to explain—l feel [Author
bows] that I am already more than pardoned. The Members of the Legislative
Council, Sir, are, of course, the Representatives of the People : I, Sir, have the
honour to be a deputation from that august assembly, commissioned to re-
quest of you, Sir, to convey to your friend and coadjutor the Honourable
Member for Grant, in the name of the Colonists of Victoria, the expression of
their well-earned thanks to that distinguished native-born Australian (or as
yourself, Sir, and the “ old hands” would good-humouredly style him, that
manly “ Currency Lad' and exemplary Colonist), as a “ thoroughly practical
Man” and energetic Settler, devoted to the best his country—
Agriculture; for his noble efforts in the Legislative Council to introduce a
measure of just and liberal policy, which (to the confusion of monopolists,
and to the discomfiture of that odious class known as “ Land Sharks”) shall
put the fifty-eight millions of unappropriated land in this glorious Colony, into
the possession, pro rata, of those who best, and indeed who alone, deserve such
great indulgence as is proposed, viz., those who will undertake to reside on,
and, according to their ability in manual labour, to cultivate, the soil, for the
benefit of this community; and, it is hoped and intended, to their own great
advantage severally. lam also instructed to convey to you, Sir, the expres-
sion of great satisfaction which is universally felt towards yourself for having
brought the subject more fully under public notice, in your well-intended
effort to support, and even to extend, the arrangement mooted by the Honourable
Member for Grant, as promulgated in your “ Question of Questions.” The
august Assembly which I represent is further desirous of supporting your
literary productions, and, of course, wishes to confer on your “Australasian
Muse” the patronage and prestige of the Honourable the Legislative Council,
in your subscription list; but we would greatly prefer supporting you in a
substantial account of this, and indeed of the other Australian Colonies,
which your lengthened experience points you out as a suitable person to ex-
pound, in sober prose, which sober-minded men of the world will in general


prefer to the flights of fancy, and the powers of imagination, however harmo-
niously breathed in numbers, as mere “ Poetry.”
Author. —d shall ponder, Sir, on what you have said, which has “ reason
in ’t;” but this Colony is so well, and so fully, and so recently laid before the
public by Mr. Westgarth and Mr. Wathen, and Australia generally by Dr.
Lang, that I should deem it to be presumptuous and supererogatory to publish
my notions further, or much further, than I have already done.
Mr. Deputation. —Except the last-named gentleman, your experience is the
greatest, and you would, I feel assured, be well supported; especially if your
views be as sound on other subjects of Colonial importance, as on the Land
Question they are generally admitted to be, and therefore popular.
Author. — I certainly have "jottings” not a few, made from time to time in
the last twenty-five years; and if I should think seriously on the subject, I
will not fail to acquaint you, but will solicit the honour of the Legislative
Council to accept the dedication. In the mean time, as a mere Poetaster, I
beg leave distinctly to disclaim any greater pretensions to the high distinction
of a Poet " than a connoisseur in painting, or an admirer of good pictures
has to the renown of Artist, or say a wine-connoisseur (which I happen to be,
i. e., a lover of good Old Port), to the title of Yintneb. But since I first
became infected with poesy, at Paramatta, four-and-twenty years ago this day
(August 13), the "perpetrations” I have committed under the tutelage of my
vagrant Muse, have been so considerable, that—as they truly extend " from
grave to gay, from lively to severe—” I have the temerity to brave the ordeal
of public opinion, quite prepared to be made mince-meat of, by the " critics,”
especially such as are better able to censure what is deserving (or even unde-
serving) of censure, than to sing better ; to be ridiculed by the youthful and
the gay, as too solemn and severe—and, more deservedly perhaps, by the
aged, the serious, and the wise, as unbecomingly mirthful and hilarious; Nemo
mortalium, omnibus horis sapit: and perhaps lam wrong in putting my "trash”
(which, I am fully aware of my versification being, comparatively with Cow-
per, Young, Pollok, Martin Tupper, and Walter Scott, Byron, and Tom
Moore), into print; but again, if so, will not the candid, especially the
talented, who are ever good-natured, admit that error non est culpam ?
John Bull — (bowing, or looking as if he would bow, if his corp-o— i.e., his
portly person of twenty-one stone and a half, would only give him leave to
stoop).—Friend Hawther, it be my pleasing dooty to interdoose to thee these
here men— Gentlemen all, they be, who’ve come along with me into thy worthy
presence, to do thee the honour, I says,—but they be all so purlight that each
on ’em calls it doing hisself the honour, of waiting on the Hawther of the great
“ Question of Questions,” to tell thee ’n’s own mind about it, which be alto-
gether in vavor of thy notions. Zo, as each of ’em wool spin his own yarn to
ye, and, thee must ha’ it out together, I shall leave ye alone, after ’xplainin
how it happens that sich a tarn-out as this, should take place ; and how I


jer umble’sarvent—and zincere friend, mind ye—happens to be at the bottom,
or, as you may zay, at the top on ’t. Thou shalt hear.
Author. —I am all attention, as well as astonishment, Mr. Bull; and, at
present, sorely perplexed, at this noble array of Learned, Reverend, and
Honourable, Gallant, and Right Worshipful Gentlemen, who have deigned to
visit so humble an individual as the obscure Author whom they now behold;
and I have not even the accommendation of seats to offer them, being only
but amply provided with chairs for all my friends. [Two stools in sight.]
Mr. Bull. —The vact is this, Zur : being myself so much deloighted with
thy notions, as put vorth, in thy “ Question of Questions,” and I may zay
on the Squatting and some other Questions, in which thee hadst done me the
vavor to make me the repositoiy of thy veelings and zentiments-—I said as
much to a gentle and a very nice man, with whom I became acquainted at a
meeting; and he zeemed to be zo completely taken with thy notions, and
what I zaid about them and their Hawther, that he zo won upon my affec-
tions, that I did quite confidentially let him into the zecret of thy dezire and
endeavour to benefit thy country in every possible way within thy power—
especially with regard to shewing the Law-makers and the Yarmers the way
to attain prosperity, and the people plenty, by means of cheap land, and
ploughing and sowing, instead of gambling with it. Upon inquiring the
name and quality of the acquaintanaee, who had thus captivated my regard,
he proved to be—who dost think ? [Authoi\ —Can’t guess—the Town Crier,
perhaps !] Zactly so—the “ Reporter and the sub or super Headitor of the
press ! Well, zuch being the case, you wont be zurpi-ized to hear, that my
secrets were zecrets no longer ; that the “ news” spread like wild-fire through-
out the City, and the Colony of Victoria, and the whole Continent of Aus-
tralia, what Mr. Hauther had said about the “ Question of Questions and
that I, your friend and father—[ Father , Mr. John Bull?] Yes, “Father,”
Zur ! Baint you from Old England, and from Zomerzet too ? [No, “Hamp-
shire.”'] Aye, from Harazhire. [Certainly!] And wouhlst thee dare to
dizown jour hown mother Britannia I [Oh no!] Or to deny your own
ancestry, being a legitimate son of “ John Bull?” [Certainly not!]
Author — (aside). —My dear friend and Paternal A ncestor I ha! ha! ha! I
am clean “ done,” —beaten hollow / I owe you one, which I shall never be
able to pay you off; but being your affectionate and dutiful son (by-the-bye,
which of your sons is the author of “ Hemmigration ?”) pray, father, be pleased
to despatch your business, and enable me to despatch mine with this multi-
tudinous and grotesque, yet illustrious assemblage, of—what am I to under-
stand ?—deputations ? delegates ? with addresses ? !!!
John Bull. ’Zactly so, son I means Mr. Hawther ; these here
gentlemen having heerd the vame of thy “ Question of Questions,” be all come
to open to thee their minds upon it; they be all delicates, and comes as
depitations ; they *ll each tell thcc the rest, and zo I have only to interdoose


’em one at a time. Now, Gentlemen, come forord and hand me your paste-
hoards, that I may make no mistakes, and I will be Hay-de-gong. This, Mr.
Hawthur, be His Worshipful the Right Lord Mayor and Corporation, nobly
reprezented by an old friend of thine, the worthy Town Cleric, formerly Aider-
man of Melbourne, and founder of the “ Argus'’ [Author . —I know him well,
and have known him long, and shake him by the hand right cordially). The
next is the Hon. Member for the Country, whose constituents cordially approve
of thy proposals for the sale of land to bonny-fide varmers, as do the citizens
and townsfolk of thy “ conditions ” for the disposal of building allotments, so as
to prevent the destruction of towns. This, Zur, be Mr. Grazier, who, on behalf
of all the Squatters that have invested hy purchasing their Runs, dezires to
express zatisfaction with thy just proposal (p. 48), that on being deprived of their
stations, they should receive moderate “ compensation” from the Government,
who must be reimbursed by the next occupiers of the land. Here, Zur, be
Mr. Alphabetical Crook, who for himself, and on behalf of all other proprietors
of land in the colony, intimates his cordial approval of thy plan for the future
disposal of Crown land, “according to a fair and just valuation whereby the
property they now hold, and have paid twenty or thirty millions of cash
sterling for, will not be unfairly depreciated, as it would be if Crown land were
now to be given away at a pound an acre or so. The next is well known to
thee as Mr. Civil-Officer-General, who on behalf of the Colonial staff of Govern-
ment servants, desires to present his compliments to thee, as being the senior
amongst them all; and as a mark of their esteem, you are to set them each
down for a copy of the “ Australian Muse.” These two gentlemen, be a Land
Surveyor and a Civil Engineer, who, in behalf of thy colleagues throughout
Australia, with this Mr. Builder, desirous to be associated with them (though
thee disclaims the profession of an architect), beg leave to support you, the
senior Surveyor, in Government or private practice, in all the Colonies, with
the expression of their entire concurrence in thy zentiments and zuggestions
on the Land Question ; and to request each to have a copy of it, and of the
“ Australian Muse.”
Author. —I am delighted to fraternise with my professional brother-chips
of the chain and theodolite, and spirit-level, which in Britain and in four
colonies I have used, more extensively than almost any other person living.
Honour me with your hands, gentlemen, in token of real good fellowship.
All three—(shaking Author’s hand). —Huzza !
Mr. Surveyor, C.E, (of Van Diemen’s Land.) —For myself and our pro-
fessional brethren in Tasmania, both in Government service and in private
practice, I have the pleasure, on the present occasion, to present the felicitations
of all your old friends and colleagues, who recognise in you, not only a veteran
surveyor, but the most severely worked and most successful Road-Engineer
and Explorer of that Colony: and though, from our present Land Regulations,
the suggestions in your “ Questiori of Questions” are less applicable to our


Island than to the several Continental Colonies, we concur in the soundness
of Mr. Horace Wills’ views and yours, as to alienating Crown Lands in suit-
able localities, on long credit, to persons who will not speculate with, hut
will guarantee to cultivate the same. But whilst expressing our desire to
support your literary effusions, in conjunction, we are sure, with all your old
friends, and the leading Colonists generally, I am desired to express to you
our sincere sympathy, in having reaped no other reward for the triumphantly
successful accomplishment of the important but difficult object of your three
years’ exploratory labours in the dense forest of the north, than the “ official
thanks ,” of his murdered Excellency, Sir Eardley Wilmot; and sir, your col-
leagues, and all the Colonists who are acquainted with the “ Western Country,”
and every person who has seen your Map of, and Report on, the new or
“Great Western Road,” —of your achievement in 61J miles, and of the old
route of 101 J miles, over Gad’s Hill, from Deloraine to Emu Bay,—all think
that such success, viz., a saving of two-fifths of the distance, and at the same
time, three-fourths of the altitudes, viz., 7,324 feet out of 10,069—the making
a short and travellable road, to supersede one long and impracticable, through
a country scarcely exceeded in physical difficulties on the face of the globe—
ought to have made your claims to consideration as irresistible to poor Sir
Eardley’s successors, as they were pronounced by your friend and patron, and
would have proved, had he been spared. Sir, you have the good wishes of
of your colleagues, who are desirous to remind you, that it may not even yet
he too late for you to obtain just consideration and recompense ; as instanced
in the case of a Mend of yours, who, after endurance of the most abominable
injustice perpetrated against him at Hobart Town, on appeal to the Privy
Council obtained the reversal of an “unwarrantable sentence,” which was
denounced by Lord Brougham ; and, as the only sort of compensation that
could be made to that Gentleman for five or six years of endurance, he was
honourably raised from the Bar to the Bench. Sir, success to you also ! Had
they but the opportunity, your professional brethren in the old country would
also no doubt be glad to join in this expression of cordial sympathy with one,
who, as a Road-Engineer, has left no feeble monument of his services on the
Great Western Road, near Salisbury, which, I believe, was yonr first public
work.
Author. —It was so, viz., in the year 1820, when just out of my articles, I
had the good fortune to effect the alteration of that road at Coombe Hill;
which, I believe, was the chief reason of my humble services being, a few
years after, invited by Prince Lieven to enter the Russian service; which I
declined. Good bye.
Mr. John Bull. —This, Zur, be Major Officer, a very old acquaintance and
pupil of thine at Sandhurst, who, on behalf of all the Military in the Colony,
and of all Sandhurst College-men at the Crimea and elsewhere, presents his
respects to thee as a comrade, or Military colleague, though o'nly a Civil Pro-


fessor of the Royal Military College, and also desires to secure for the Service
a copy of your “ Muse.” This gentleman, though a soldier, is also deputed
by the R.M.C. Civilians in these Colonies, including amongst your quondam
College cadets, with His Excellency Sir George Grey, of the Cape, late Gover-
nor of New Zealand, and the Chief Commissioner of Gold-fields in this
colony, Captains Lugard and Kater, in New South Wales, and Mr. Calder,
the Senior Government Surveyor in Van Diemen’s Land, —to convey to you
their respects and good wishes, and, of course, to set them down as sub-
scribers to the “ Austral-Asian Muse.”
[Here the worthy Aide-de-camp, finding -his strength and his breath failing, very judiciously
pauses in his ceremonial, to re-invigorate both, by the application of a pistol (which, as a careful
and cautious , though not timid, character, he generally carries in his capacious pocket) to his
—not to his head, most courteous, delighted, And,handsome reader —but to his capacious mouth;
the instrument being a compact and portable vessel, not for destruction, but imbibition, vulgarly
called a “pocket-pistol,” used to carry liquor more spirituous than the cold tea, which in this
instance —being, as Mr. Bull admitted, properly “ medicated”—had the happiest effect upon the
bland disposition of that gentleman, inspiring him with new life and energy, and rendering him
“ all serene,” like Mr. Pickwick himself; and he then resumed his introductions thus, to our
friend “the Author,” who had availed himself of the opportunity to exchange courtesies with
his distinguished guests, embracing and caressing three of them, which were the Delicates he
liked best.]
Mr. Bull. —Mr. Hawther, I resumes my introductions, with these two
Gentlemen, the Surgeon of H. M. ship “ Duke,” and the Captain of the same,
who wished also to accompany him. I should tell ’ee, zur, that, it having got
abroad —from my “ confidential friend” the Reporter, I suppose—that you be
the zon of a Zailor, although he wur also a doctor; these gentlemen resolved
that the Royal Navy, in which thy vather served with honour as Surgeon, in the
American and French Wars, should, as well as the Military in these parts, pay
thee the compliment of ordering one of thy Books for the use of the Naval Ser-
vice, as Jack Tars be always fond of a zong. This Gentleman, Dr. Cure’em, on
behalf of the Medical Profession throughout the colony, the same : one copy.
Here, zur, is Mr. G. V. Young, on behalf of the Tragic and Comic Muse, and
of the Musicians vocal and instrumental, recognising your claims to their con-
sideration, as the author of a dramatic piece, request to have a copy of your
“ Muse,” and tender their services to bring out your Bush Opera.
Author. —The honour done me, and the favour offered, are inexpressibly
great and flattering. My little Opera, 5 1 would much like to see brought out,
and that immediately (and, in order not to deprive it of novelty, before the
publication of the Poem in which'it is comprised) for the benefit of the Widows
of the War, and for two other desirable objects ; but I have ever contemplated
bringing it out with the kind assistance, principally, but certainly not exclu-
sively, of amateurs.
Mr. Bull. —This, Zur, be Mr. Hamature, deputed by the Garrick Club to
set them down for the “ Muse,” and to tender their services to bring out you
Opera.


Author. —Ten thousand thanks: with the powerful co-operation of one or
two professional “ stars,” success is certain.
Mr. Bull. —These two Gentlemen, representing your old colleagues, the
Government-officers, and the old Colonists of New South Wales, greet you
heartily; these two Gentlemen from South Australia, the same ; these two
from Van Diemen’s Land, ditto: and each desires to subscribe for your
“ Muse,” and also for thy “ Question of Questions,” which they declare is
alike applicable to the other colonies as to Victoria. These three aborigines
from the three Colonies desire to greet you cordially. [ Blacks . —Budgeree
fellow you; kombarly you boojeree white fellow ; you bery good. Black-fellow
you long time ago, I believe —broder belonging to mine—den merrijig jump
up white-fellow. Budgeree, ah ! yah I bullarto gaygip, by and bye, big moon*
plenty corroheree : you come.
Author. —Budgeree, Black fellows, I believe.” I wish, from my soul, Mr.
Bull, it were in my power to do something effectual, for the good of these
simple, harmless, wretched, and abused, yet gentle and even amiable poor
creatures. I have ever felt-—though I blush to think how little I have shown—
a warm interest in these our miserable fellow-creatures; our equals in the
sight of God, as mortal men; but whose inferiors, I fear, we are greatly, as
cruel instead of gentle, compassionate, kind, and sympathising, which, as
human fellow-creatures, blest with Christianity, and boasting of humanity and
civilization, we ought to be; and much more their “protectors” and guides
in the paths of humanity and religion, than we, the intruders into their coun-
try, are or have been (I do not say or admit “unjustified interlopers,” such idea
would be both farcical and pharisaical in the highest degree)—but as uninvited
guests of the original and abject denizens of Australia, we are bound, by every
obligation professed to the Supreme Being by Christians, and avowed to Man-
kind by the honour of the British Nation, to ameliorate and improve their
condition, who —however humble as a race, in our estimation, and in that of
all your sons, Mr. John Bull —yet form one of the Races, constituting the
brotherhood of the large human family descended from one common ancestor 1
I feel now very strongly on this subject, and have felt,and can never cease to
feel, since the Almighty, by His Providence, made two of these simple, but
not barbarous race, the instruments of saving my life, on the 27th of May,
1850, when I was at the very last extremity, and on the point of perishing
from exhaustion, fatigue, and starvation, at Myers s Creek (then dry), near
the now Bendigo gold-field, after having lost my horse, and been myself lost
in the Bush four days, without food or fire! when, upon inquiry, which I
had just strength left to make, of my sable and unexpected deliverer, who
was not less the saviour of my life than if he had been an angel from Heaven
to administer to my necessities, “ What name you ?” I was greeted
by (me of the finest young Aboriginals I had ever beheld, with the certainly
extraordinary reply, “ Prince Albert” (no unworthy representative to


me, of Lis Royal and illustrious namesake !) whose successful shot at
a “ morepork,” or speckled owl —which I called fowl —instantly cooked,
with the aid of his companion Charlie, “ son of King Charlie,” was, by giv-
ing me food, when in the very last stage of exhaustion, the means, in the
hands of Providence, of saving my life. I now pray, as I then prayed, with
fervent gratitude to God, that may be conceived, but cannot be described,
that “my life, thus providentially saved, may be prolonged, in order to become
a blessing to my family, and of service to mankindand especially, is my
heart’s desire, to these pjoor aborigines of Australia.
Mr. Bull. —’ Tis but natural and proper, Zur, that thee should thus feel
towards the whole race of the sable natives, by whom your life was thus pro-
i
videntially saved. I wish you could get a “ bumper house” at your Bush Opera,
and lay out the proceeds judiciously for their benefit.
Author. —That is precisely my hope, and my long-cherished intention.
Mr. Bull. —This young gentleman wishes to speak to you himself.
Currency Lad. —l, too, am a “Native ” of Australia, and am deputed. Sir, by
all the Native Youths, both older and younger than myself, to acknow-
ledge, with our respects, the compliment you have been pleased to pay to us,
in dedicating to us your “Question of Questions,” and politely styling us the
“manly Sons of the Soil,” which we hope and believe, that, as a body, we
are; and we beg, Sir, that you will set us all down as subscribers to your
“ Austral-Asian Muse.”
Author. —You are a noble lad. What age are you, my young friend?
Currency Lad. —Twelve, nearly.
Author. —Then, my dear boy, I will take care that you shall have a copy;
and you may tell all your little friends, younger than yourself, that I shall
present a good many of them with the production of my humble Muse, and
for that purpose will send one or two copies to every school (of girls as well as
boys) in the Colony, to be read by all the scholars, and presented to the best
of my “juvenile friends,” for such I esteem all young people of whom I am
very fond, having some of my own; on condition of their learning to recite
nicely, one or two pieces, which I shall point out.
Currency Lad. —lf you please, Sir, we all wish to have your “ Question
of Questions” also, as we are told by our parents that we shall understand the
subject better in a few years, and be deeply interested in it; and we quite un-
derstand “Mr. John Bull,” and his and your capital songs about “Separa-
tion,” and “ Him and Hem-migration;” and can sing them too—l can—and
we ’ll all join in “ toorle loorle” in prime style, and make the Bush echo to
your heart’s content, Sir, especially will we all, at the Diggings, in singing the
“ Gold-digger’s Song,” dedicated to our colleague, Henry N. L. S. Kentish,
Gold Finder and Currency Lad, that’s your son, Sir ;by the Amateur Lau-
reate of Victoria, Gold Digger, that’s his father —so we all say, and that you
won’t deny it.


A uthor. —Why should I, my fine little fellow ? There’s nothing to be
ashamed of, as the maker of songs and verses,
“ Except , indeed, when verses are so bad,
As to be justly styled, ‘ bad prose run mad.’ ”
But who have we next ? so little and so pretty
Mr. Bull. —These be three of my little grand-daughters; pretty, and pret-
tily named, be these most important delicates ofidhem all. The little girls
shall speak for themzelves. *
Australia (with Tasmania and Victoria). —If you please, Sir, the Bishops
and the Clergy, of all nations, and of all denominations, have sent us chil-
dren to say to you. Sir, that for themselves, in the name of “Christians ,” they
wish to have a copy of your Poetical Book, Sir; because they all expect it
will contain moral and religious reading ; and they wish to show their respect
for the Author who first attempted to introduce serious matter, fit for Sunday
reading, into the Bush in Australia, by publishing and making an attempt to
establish the “ Christian Magazine,” in New South Wales, exactly twenty-
one years ago.
Author. —Then, my little delicate Delegates, you are the very best and most
suitable representatives of all Christians; for, besides being pretty, you are
gentle, meek, and humble. Are not you ?
Victoria. —-Yes, Sir, and we hope you will put something in your Book that
we can read, who are very young children.
Author. —l give you a kiss each, as a pledge that I will endeavour to do so,
and to make my volume worthy of your Ministers’ and Parents’ perusal also,
and of yours, when you are grown up.
Tasmania. —If you please, Sir, we would wish you to let us see the Maga-
zine you published for Sunday reading in the Bush, with the ode in it called
“ Religion’s all.”
Author. —I will, therefore, annex it, and another little work in prose, to
the “Religious Miscellany,” in the Austral Asian Muse; and thus embrace an
opportunity of circulating amongst both young and old, reading, which if
less amusing, will be more edifying than any other compositions of my writing;
and you will like that best, from which you may most improve yourselves, in
all that is amiable and good. Will not you?
Australia. —Yes Sir, indeed that we will; and we will love you as another
Papa.
Author. —I already love you next to my own children; and, therefore, as I
dare say you would like to know, I will tell you how I happened, without
being a Clergyman, to write and publish on the subject of Religion. When I
came to Australia, many years before you were born, I had a very great
number, nearly a thousand convicts, at work upon the roads, placed under my
charge; and as I soon found that they had not a single Bible amongst them
all, nor, during all the years that many of them had been in the Colony, had


heard the name of God used except to blaspheme, I felt it to be my duty and
very great privilege, as a Christian man, to exert such influence as I possessed,
to introduce some religious observances amongst these poor outcasts; and,
notwithstanding some ridicule heaped on me by my Official superior, as a
“ methodist and a fanatic;” as the Government refused to oppose my efforts,
they, by God’s blessing, so far at least succeded, that they led to the intro-
duction of a better state of things, including chaplains and lay preachers to
itinerate in the bush generally, as well as to visit the Road-Gangs on Sundays.
In support of this object, and with a view to cause to be circulated, in the far
interior throughout the Colony , a publication suitable for Sabbath reading, I
commenced the Magazine called, “ The Christian in Australia;” but so great
was the opposition to any thing serious, and especially of a religious character,
that the first number printed was surreptitiously destroyed; and on its repe.
tition, not the slightest encouragement, was given to it; and as I could not
afford to publish without payment, I was reluctantly compelled to give it up.
But you shall see that first and last number of “the Christian,” dated June
15th, 1834.
Mr. Bull.— These, your old New Zealand friends, will address you in their
own language.
E Tipe, New Zealand Chief. —E boa ! Tena koe. Kei hea tou wahine pai
to tamariki hoki, ka kite i a au i mua kite Wai Pounamou?*
Author. —Tena koe, E Tipe. Kahore au e mohio te reo Maori. Korero
mai kite reo Pakeha. Ka Kupu mohio nga, Tena koe E Tipe?f
E Tipe. —Well, I do remember, very many years ago, when I was a little
boy, and you were but a young man, your living many months at Guard’s
Whaling Station, Kakapoh, Cloudy Bay, with your handsome wife and two
infant girls, shipwrecked from the leaky Brig “ Sarah,” with a drunkard
Captain. lam glad to see you here in your own country, yet alive and
well. I hear that you are a great friend of the late Governor-in-Chief, Sir
George Grey, and I like you the better on that account, as he was a just
and noble Governor over both Maories and English. There were no White
Settlers when you were at Cloudy Bay, twenty-one years ago, for your wife
was the only white woman seen there, except Mrs. Guard.
E Tipes Wife. —Do you remember the terror into which you and your
wife were thrown, one moonlight night, by the arrival of one hundred
Maories, in their canoes, from the opposite coast ? You all thought it was
Tyroa’s party, and expected that they would kill and eat you and your
children.
• My friend, I greet you. Where are your fair wife and pretty children that I saw with
you, long time ago, in New Zealand?
t Good day, my friend E Tipe. I recollect so little of the Maori language, you must speak
to me in English. I can only ask you, how do you do ?"


Author. —lndeed I can never forget that terrible night! The Natives,
who happily proved to be our friends, danced their war dance on the
beach; whilst Mrs. Kentish and Mrs. Guard were thrown into hysterics.
E. Tipe. —We heard that your friends were making you a visit of
honour, and we gladly joined them to see you, and to rub noses, in
token of friendship and of former acquaintance. Good bye.
Mr. Bull. —This, Zur, be the representative of the “Fourth Estate of the
Empire”—the great and glorious Free Press— the organ of the People.
Typo. —Sir, on behalf of the Press in Australia, Tasmania, and New
Zealand, I have the honour to claim you as a colleague, and am deputed to
say that in addressing the oldest Editor in Australia, who was formerly the
Proprietor and Editor of the Paper at that time of largest circulation in this
Hemisphere—the Sydney Times —one who has been connected with the Press
in South Australia, and Van Diemen’s Land; and who was the first Author as
well as Poet who put his thoughts to paper in New Zealand; —we beg to inti-
mate our cordial good will, and desire to support you, the “ Father of the
Press” in these Colonies, with our influence, as far as we may do so with
honour and consistency; and more, we are sure, you would not desire of us.
Author. —Nor would I willingly accept more than your kind support, so
far as it may be legitimately accorded to me, unsolicited—but that I am
capable of appreciating.
Old Hand. —I am an older colonist than yourself, Sir, and was a subscriber
to your temperately conducted newspaper, from its first issue in 1834, till you
left Sydney for a Government Appointment in South Australia, I believe, in
1839 ; and on behalf of all your subscribers —which I know comprised nearly
all the Magistrates and respectable Settlers and Citizens in those days—l
have the pleasure to order a copy of your “ Muse” for each, well assured
that they will all be glad to -revive acquaintance with her, and with the
Editor of the “ Sydney Timesand without fail you must enter each one for
a copy of this “ Question of Questions,” for there is not one of them, I will
vouch, who will not wish to have it; or who will not wish to see your sound
and reasonable proposals, for the alienation of Crown Land in Victoria,
carried into effect also, in New South Wales ; —so that you may count on the
support of the “ old hands” generally—who also much approve of your proposed
“ Sheep and Cattle Insurance” against cattarrh, and black-leg; and would
like to see it carried out yet, as a far better plan than any the Government
has adopted, or seems likely to adopt.
Author.- —lt is with much gratitude, as well as pleasure, that I receive
your cordial greeting and kind remembrances of “auld lang syne,” firmly
persuaded that there are hundreds of my old fellow-colonists who will thus
warmly greet me as an acquaintance, and, in some sense at least, as a
“ Literary Friend.”


Old Hand. —Doubtless a new race lias sprung up, since you lived in the
Colonnade; but besides your old friends, which are still numerous, many of
them now in the Council, including our talented Speaker, Sir John Nicholson,
Dr. Lang, George Rt. Nichols, the Suttors, etc.: but as the inhabitants have
not degenerated, but “advanced,”! am persuaded that amongst the leading
men of the Colony, there is not a reading man who would not desire to
subscribe to the “ Austral-Asian Muse,” if he were aware of such a publication
of honafide “Colonial Poetry,” by an old “f&r in the Bush”—especially if you
were to enrich the Volume with some of the gems from the pens of your old
and talented friends Kenry ESalloran and Mr. Woolls, of this Colony; Sir
William a’Beckett, and Mr. Hurrey, of Victoria; also, Mr. Home, the accom-
plished author of Orion, if he still woos his Muse in this Continent; and Mrs.
Bailey, and other talented Poets in Tasmania and South Australia, with
whose effusions of taste and genius, your habits and associations have
doubtless made you acquainted.
Author. —This is the very purpose I had in contemplation in 1851, when
the Gold-diggings were discovered in this Colony—which was defeated by the
sudden desertion of every Printing-office in Melbourne, which, as is well
known, had the very greatest difficulty in bringing out the two newspapers
that alone survive, out of five.* It is my present purpose to bring out a
second volume of the “ Austral-Asian Muse,” to consist of all the best pieces
composed in these Colonies, which have from time to time appeared in the
various newspapers and magazines ; and as these Australian and Tasmanian
compositions must possess much local interest , in addition to the poetic
merit of no mean degree, to which many are known to be entitled, it is my
hope to make the work, as a whole, inferior to none that has yet issued from
the press in the Southern Hemisphere; and that the beauties, the variety and
excellence of the pearls in the Second Volume of “ Compilations of Australia’s
Muse,” by the Editor, will abundantly compensate for the short-comings of
the Eirst Volume, by the Author. On issuing the Prospectus (in the cover),
*By way of illustration, one instance may be worthy of record. The best Magazine ever
issued in this or any other of these Colonies, was the Austral-Aslan Quarterly Review, published
at Geelong, so ably edited by G. H. Wathen, Esq., who has just published, in England, “The
Golden Colony of Victoria,” The fifth number was passing through the press, at that time
(October or November, 1851), when not only were the sheets printed, left unfolded by the print-
ers ; but the printer, compositors, and pressmen, bolted off to Ballaarat en masse, and with them
press, types and all, which might have been seen in transitu between Geelong and the diggings,
on a certain vehicle yclept “Wheelbarrow,” impelled bya most—extraordinary influence, I was
going to say, but that would be the very reverse of fact and of truth; for the influence was and
is not at all extraordinary, but perfectly irresistible , of the motive power, which, guided by the
strong arms of the Printer’s Devil, attracted the said literary conveyance and company; and
that was the magic wand of the great Wizard of the South, which was currently reported, and
most solemnly believed, to consist of “ pure Gold.'"


in 1851, I received such encouraging promises of support and 00-opefatiou
from friends and acquaintances, inclusive of Poets not a few, from each of
the Colonies, with flatteringly kind letters from several influential characters,
intimating a more than ordinary desire to see “ my well-directed efforts to
* advance Australia,’ in the quality in which she is most defective literary
reputation,” well sustained and warmly supported; and from none more
so, than from the late Governor-General, Sir Charles Pitzroy; that if
I had not been defeated in my purpose by the gold discovery, I believe
I should have benefitted myself, as well “ as made an agreeable and valuable
addition to Australian literature,” as observed by more than one of my cor-
respondents ; but though times are not just now so good, readers are more
numerous; and I will hope that Colonists will not be less liberal nor less
■patriotic as Australians and Tasmanians, in favouring me with their names as
subscribers. In this respect I know that my wealthy, rough-and-ready friends
at the Gold-fields, will not be backward, especially as I claim fellowship with
them all, as a honafide “ G.D.my more fortunate son took his degree of G.F.,
with great eclat, by finding, in conjunction with a party of three other young
fellows, ten pounds of gold at Fryer’s Creek, in about as many days. This
Gentleman in plaid jumper, I have no doubt, is the Diggers’ Delegate; flue
manly chap, he is too, with his black beard and moustache; he looks capable
of taking out a nugget of a hundred-weight.
Miner, G.D. and G.F. —Jolly old fellow! I come to tell you, on behalf of all
the Diggers on all the Gold-fields, that you ’re a “ Brick,” and no mistake. We
have seen your “ Question of Questions,” and approve of your suggestions to
a man; and what’s more, we are resolved, as a body, to support you in
carrying them into effect. We heard your Gold-digger’s Song, and suny it
too , when you first wrote it and dedicated it to your son, who was “one of us,”
and as fine, manly a young fellow as ever sunk a hole, or “ pulled out” a
nugget, or shared his grub with and gave his “ ounce” to an unlucky digger,
as he was ever the first to do; and for that alone, and the downright “ good
advice,” so good-humouredly given at the foot of your song, we’d stick to
you, and give you our support right heartily: so I may tell you that you may
please to send to all the Diggers your “ Question of Questions,” and without
question they ’ll every one of ’em take it, and pay to your collectors at the
diggings; and we ’ll each subscribe to your two volumes, authorial and editorial,
of the “ Austral-Asian Muse and any number of us will pay for it in advance
if it will be any convenience to you, as the many may help the few ; and by
Jupiter, that’s rhyme as well as reason.
Author. —Thanks, most kind and liberal friend: your order is as extensive
as your mind is liberal, and as your “pile,” I hope, deep, and those of your
confreres , the hardy, hard-working, jolly, and lucky diggers. I shall send a
portion of this little publication to each of the Gold-fields, and thus afford
your friends, who ma} r be disposed to support my literary effort, an oppor-


lunity of doing so, by setting down their names as subscribers at my agents’,
or by addressing me at my publishers’. But being a believer in the maxim
that “ there are but two sorts of bad pay,” I will on no account accept pay-
ment, until the delivery of the work, and then, to provide against the
difficulty of communication with subscribers scattered all over Australia, I
will hope for the favour, in general, of cash on delivery; any other mode of
collection being altogether impracticable.
Miner. —I cannot blame you for your scrupulousness, which is honourable;
but may I ask you, did a “ Gold-digger,” who I remember offered you his
assistance, in a manner apparently bona fide, through the “Argus,” several
years ago, to test your alleged “ motive-power,” ever keep his word, or per-
sonally communicate with you?
Author. —He did not: nor have I the remotest idea who was the party.
The Editor of the Argus informed me that he was a gentleman of ample
means, and perfectly sincere; but he did not feel at liberty to reveal his
name ; and so his public offer ended—very much like that of sundry private
“ friends”—in smoke. lam averse to the use of a vulgar word; but I know of
none, in the English or any other language, so expressive of that which it
has been my fate to experience, more frequently and more severely than I
both hope and believe any other man living, at all events than any other
Colonist in Australia, as that of “humbug !”
Miner.- —Would your “ motive power” be applicable to quartz crushing?
Author. —Perfectly; and, also, to the removal of a crushing-machine,
however ponderous, upon anything like a tolerably even surface, being level
or nearly so.
Miner. —There are hundreds of mining parties at this moment, would be
both willing and desirous to place any requisite amount of funds at your dis-
posal, to give it a fair trial, if they but knew this from your own lips.
Author. —They now have it from my own hand.
Miner. —You shall hear further from me very shortly. In the meantime,
as I find that I am left alone with you and our paternal friend, Mr. John
Bull, may I hope that, before taking my departure for Forest Creek and
Bendigo, you will both regale with me, and drink “success to the Gold Diggers
of Victoria.” [Mr. Bull. — Hear, hear /]
Author. —We shall be delighted.
Philosopher. —The garrulity and bluntness of your friend “ John Bull”
having confirmed the report, and caused it to be generally known, that a Co-
lonist of such practical observation and experience, whom he with great fami-
liarity designates an old “ in the Bush,” has promised to open his eyes
as a “ New Chum,” as he calls himself-—with respect to the several topics of
importance that now agitate the public mind in this Colony, by giving him
the benefit of his opiniomand sentiments:—! am deputed by the gentlemen,
who, on behalf of the various sections of this community, have had the


honour to present addresses to you, to solicit the favour of being permitted to
share with your sterling Paternal Friend, Mr. John Bull, in the pleasure of
your society, and in the advantage derivable from your interesting and edi-
fying discussions with that frank and substantial Gentleman.
Author. —Need I to say that I am greatly flattered by the honour done me,
in preferring such.request. In every respect I shall be the gainer by the cor-
dial acquiescence which I yield ; and, as our meetings are “ harmonious,” in
every sense of the word, I hope that you and your several coadjutors are
good vocalists.
Enter Mr. Bull, with a posse —not of constables, hut of Colonists.
Mr. Bull. —Now, Zur, if you please, we’ll have your paper on —
.4 ll. —Hear ! hear!
the gold-itields and their Concomitants.
Author. —My thoughts, Mr. John Bull, and Gentlemen, on this subject,
would occupy hours instead of minutes, a large volume instead of a small
page, if entered into fully: of this neither time nor space will admit
Without looking back, therefore, to comment on the errors which unfortu-
nately were committed, with respect to this most important interest, in the
early part of auriferous discovery, I have only to say, that even now it seems
to me most desirable and essential, that no unregistered person should be
permitted to dig for gold ; and that none should be registered, or licensed by
the Government, but naturalized subjects of the Queen of England and Aus-
tralia, without security being given for honesty, and submission to our laws
and regulations. Desiring to avoid entering on Colonial Politics, I have no
more to say on this topic.
Mr. Bull. —What is your opinion as to the quantity of Gold.
Author. —That it may be fairly deemed “ inexhaustible and that now
sensible and powerful machinery is being so generally brought to bear upon
the matrix; far larger fortunes will be realized, than yet have been, by Gold-
diggers.
Mr. Bull. —I be, and I thinks we all be, on-tirely of your opinion, Zur ;
and as I knows that young Gentleman, so very like to thee, has been a Gold-
digger, and a Gold-finder too, and can sing a very good song, I beg leave to
call upon your son and heir
Henry N. L. Kentish. —I must be your grandson then, Mr. Bull. So
having the words of a Gold-diggers song, which was made and affectionately
dedicated to me G. E., by the Amateur Laureate, your son and ray father,
G. D., I ’ll do my best, conditioned that you all join in chorus right heartily.


MOUNT ALEXANDER GOLD DIGGERS’ SONG.
Chorus hy all the Diggers , in full costume.
[Anxiously solicitous for the prosperity of his Son, and of his friends and
fellow-colonists at the Gold-fields of Victoria, in their laborious hut glorious
occupation (“ Nihil sine laboref is the writer’s, and should be the Gold-digger’s
motto;) and assured that no circumstance is better calculated to promote
success in their arduous pursuit, than mirth and good humour, cordial co-
operation and cheerful labour; the undersigned, with a view to aid their
laudable desire to dig in harmony , earnestly recommends to the vocal con-
sideration of the Worshipful the fraternity of Gold-diggers in general, and of
Gold-finders in particular (also to that most comprehensive class in the whole
World, the Gold-seekers), this “ Victorian Gold-diggers Song:” affectionately
inscribed to Henry N. L. S. Kentish, G.F., by the Amateur Laureate of Vic-
toria, G.D.; by whom presented to all Gold-diggers.
Aik.— The Coronation.
You’ve heard, no doubt, the ins and- outs
Of He and She-migration ;*
And now I will remove your doubts,
About Gold-exploration.
’Twas Sydney old, that first found Gold,
And made the declaration
That “ Ophir” Gold, all might behold.
Cut off by “Separation,”
From Port Phillipians, toorle 100
Hi toorle loorle lido.
Disclaiming aught with them to do.
Ri toorle loorle lido.
Rul now “ the case is altered !” much,
Quite to the consternation
Of Sydney folks, and other such,
Who view with perturbation,
The Golden region we have found.
From them, by Proclamation
Cat off; whei’e “nuggets” most abound..
Victoria—Separation ! !
Cut off from Sydney, toorle 100,
Hi toorle loorle lido ;
And all their kidney, and friends too,
Ri toorle loorle lido.
* An Immigrant's Song , perpetrated by the same Poet, hr South Australia.


Of “ Turon Diggings” we have heard,
And tender gratulation,
With all good feelings—’pon my word, —
To New South Wales—Old Nation.
But “out of them ice’ll take the shine,,"
With much consideration,
By showing our unequalled mine
To their commiseration.
For digging health, and digging wealth,
There’s nought like excavation ;
And health and wealth not gained by stealth,
Proclaim high reputation ;
Which true Victorians now enjoy,
Who dig for relaxation ;
Gold by the ounce, and the pound Troy,
Free from unjust taxation.
True Bushmen we, we all agree.
That no consideration^
Shall cause disturbance ’mongst the free,
Upon this Golden Station.
In Bush attire, let each aspire,
By noble emulation,
To gain a Digger’s chief desire—-
Gold, by wise regulation.
With spades and picks, we work like Bricks,
And dig in gold formation ;
And stir our cradles with short sticks,
To break conglomeration ;
This Golden trade, doth not degrade
The man of information,
Who shovels nuggets with the spade,
Of beauteous conformation.
What mother, can her infant stock
View with more satisfaction,
Than we our golden cradles rock,
Which most love to distraction?
Hi toorle loorle loorle 100.
Hi toorle loorle loorle 100.
Hi toorle loorle loorle 100.
Hi toorle loorle loorle 100,


Let those who dare, try thwart our care,
At our gold occupation ;
They with bewilderment will stare
At Golden incubation.
We dig and delve from six to twelve ;
And then for relaxation,
We wash our pans and cradles shelve,
And turn to mastication;
Some decked in blue, and some in red,
Then with vociferation
Resume our work till time for bed,
Without refrigeration.
Where gold abounds, we “ dig” up pounds,
A charming recreation!
When stone or wet our work confounds,
We deal in execration.
Too much I fear, of this all hear,
Upon my reputation,
Who sink a hole, or surface clear,
Tor Gold remuneration.
But when success, our labours bless,
At this Gold occupation;
Our thanks and joy we all express,
By the appropriation
Of “ nuggets” large, of golden gains,
To the amelioration
Of want ’mongst those to whom remains,
Alas! deterioration.
Gold Digging's a laborious trade,
Un-gentle occupation ;
Gold Finding , such has glorious made,
And will make a new Nation 1
Britannia’s Sons—Victoria’s Sons,
The pride and admiration
Of all the World, whom their luck “ stuns”—
Thus ends mv Gold-oration.
Hi toorle, loorle, loorle 100.
Hi toorle, loorle, loorle 100.
Hi toorle, loorle, loorle 100.
Hi toorle, loorle, loorle 100.
Hi toorle, loorle, loorle 100.


T*t what is Gold, without the prize
And best glorification
Of young and old—fond sighs—bright eyes
Extorting adoration !
As to their Queen, hearts loyal lean
In love and admiration ;
So in our conduct, may be seen
Each manly aspiration,
Hi toorle, loorle, loorle 100,
Ri toorle, loorle, lido
Ri toorle, loorle, loorle 100
Hi toorle loorle lido

* A SHILLING’S WORTH or ADVICE TO “ DIGGERS ” —A DECIDED BARGAIN,
WELL WORTH A NUGGET !
Friend! unto thee, I would give good advice,
But that it is unheeded, at that price;
Whilst bought experience , as you right well know,
Is that from which most benefit doth flow.
Digger, be wise, and purchase counsel sound,
That would be dirt-cheap at a single pound
Of Gold ! ’T is worth a nugget, more than shilling,
To teach you, “ at your labour to be willing—
Instead of grumbling, when some work goes wrong—
Be kind— be cheerful, and tune up my song.”
For this advice alone, I take a fee ;
My humble song I freely give to thee,
Conditioned—that when you have dug up wealth,
You do not fail to drink the poet’s health,
Whose song you sing, and who from his heart gives—
“ Success to every honest man that lives.”
* One moiety of the “ fees for advice,” to be handed to the Gold Commissioner, as the first
subscription towards a fund for the relief of such Diggers, or other persons in connection with
the mines, as may by sickness, accident, or other cause, stand in need of friendly assistance.
Mem. It is confidently hoped that the Minstrel's example will he liberally followed
by all Gold-finders, who, when they deposit their “ pounds” with the Commissioner, may well
afford to subscribe a “nugget” to the Digger’s Fund, for luck; but in electing Trustees and
Managers, let them carefully avoid the “ Honourable Members ” of the Committee of the Bush-
Fire Sufferers’ Relief Fund.


Mr. Bull (amidst shouts of applause from Miner and all hands). Well
done, my dear Australian grandson, G. D.! —I begs pardon, G.F. I proposes,
Gentlemen all, that we gives three cheers for the Singer, and three cheers for
the Author, and three cheers for their jolly old Father and Grandfather, John
Bull ; that ’s me; and here’s to our noble selves, and to every Gold-digger
in the Colony, and good health and good luck ; huzza ! and now I call upon
our friend Miner.
Miner. —l have much pleasure in responding, Mr. Bull, Mr. G.F., and
gentlemen all, to give you the Victorian “ Rule Britannia.” written by our
friend, the author of the song just sung by his son, in celebration of “ Sepa-
ration and as we are all loyal subjects to the backbone, lam sure it will be
acceptable to all Australians, and the number of friends present will give
effect to the chorus.
COMMEMORATION NATIONAL ANTHEM.
VICTORIAN-AUSTRALIAN “RULE BRITANNIA,”
COMPOSED IN CELEBRATION, OF THE GLORIOUS OCCASION, OF “ SEPARATION.”
RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO THE LADIES OE VICTORIA.
When Britain first at Heaven’s command
Arose from out this azure main;
This was the Charter of the Land,
And guardian angels sung this strain; —
Rule Britannia, Britannia rule the waves—
For Britons never shall be slaves !
And now Australia is arisen,
The Southern Hemisphere to bless;
The joy be ours, to whom ’t is given.
In glorious accents to express—
Rule Australia, Victoria rule the waves—
For Britain’s Sons shall ne’er be Slaves !
Though distant from our Father-Land ;
Our hearts we tender fair, to share
With those who can best understand,
Our truth —the lovely British Fair !
Rule Britannia—Victoria rule the waves—
Victoria’s Sons shall ne’er be Slaves !


Yet British Maidens, though you ’re blest
With Virtue and unnumbered charms,
Australian Lasses well contest
The conquest of true Lovers’ arms!
Rule Australia—Victoria rule the waves—
True Britons’ Sons shall ne’er be Slaves !
As brave as Britons’ Sons must be,
With hearts affectionate and warm;
We dare to share upon the sea,
Their merit, both in calm and storm !
Rule Victoria—Australia rule the waves
True British Scions ne’er be Slaves!
Manly, are all Victoria’s Youth,
And charming, as her glorious clime;
For love-of-freedom famed, and Truth !
Country and Sons are in their prime!
Rule Victoria—Australia rule the waves—
Victoria’s Sons will ne’er be Slaves !
Whilst neighbouring Countries, great and small,
By dearth or foes may be opprest;
In peace and plenty, more than all
Be thou by health and Nature blest!
Rule Australia—Victoria rule the waves,
True Britons’ Sons shall ne’er be Slaves !
Victoria hail ! hail our loved Queen!
To Heaven our heart-felt pceans rise !
Not Erin’s Isle is half so green !
Nor Land more fair, beneath the skies!
Rule Victoria—Australia rule the waves—
Victoria’s Sons shall ne’er be Slaves !
All Nature’s seeds from Britain cold,
In this mild climate but improve;
Herds, flocks, and bales, can scarce be told!
And hearts are found most time in love !
Rule Australia —Victoria rule the waves—
Victoria’s Sons shall ne’er be Slaves!


■Victoria new —Australia grand!
Hail, verdant soil of Grove and Plain f
Of Freedom’s Laws, now happy Land—
Hail, Mistress of the Southern main !
Rule Britannia—Australia rule the waves—
Victoria’s Sons shall ne’er be Slaves!
The Amateur Laureate of Victoria.
October 7, 1850.
Mr. Bull. —Nothing can be more proper and more delightful than such
true loyalty—and as the Vather as well as loving zubject of Queen Victoria
—God bless her Majesty ! I returns thanks to the Author and capital singer,
and I proposes the health of “ the Queen long life to her, and confusion to

Queen,” which is the only anthem that can surpass the last.

The Amateur Laureate of Victoria,
Here the enthusiasm of the loyal vocalists, and their acclamations with
which they rent the air, surpassing all description, are left entirely to the
imagination of the courteous and handsome and delighted reader, i. e., singer
of course—who is earnestly invited, before parting from the bacchanalians, to
join them and the writer in a glass of wine, to drink to “ better acquaintance.”
“ Most happy,” we understood the polite reader to say distinctly. The
Author bows and drinks, and “is most happy too.” [Qy. two.—Printer’s Devil.]
Author’s Servant. —Here is another Reputation, sir, of Gentlemen from the
Exhibition Building.
Secretary of Melbourne University. —Sir, I have the pleasing duty to wait on
you, as the delegate of the Scholastic Establishments throughout Victoria, to
intimate that the heads of the University, and of the public and private
Schools, whilst approving cordially of your agricultural sentiments, enunciated
in your “Question of Questions,” having the pleasure to recognise in its
author, a fellow-labourer in the great cause of education, as having been
formerly a Professor in the Royal Military College of England (many of whose
cadet pupils now hold a distinguished position in this and the neighbouring
Colonies, and amongst our gallant troops, now alas ! nobly imperilling their
lives at the Crimea and elsewhere) desire to unite with the other sections cf
the Colonists, who also warmly fraternise with you, in expressing their earnest
desire to support the Poetical Work you have announced, which, has such
strong claims on the reading, thinking, and intellectual classes of Colonists,
that they deem it to be their pleasing duty, to encourage by every means in
their power, this, almost the very first emanation of strictly Australian Literature ;
and as one volume is from the pen of their fellow Colonist, whilom of Sand-
hurst College, they have the greater satisfaction in requesting him to let th«


Melbourne University, and each School in the Colony, be entered as Sub-
scribers to the “ Austral-Asian Muse,” and also to your “ Question of
Questions.”
Author. — The extensive patronage thus kindly bestowed on me, can only be
exceeded by the honour which I have gratefully to acknowledge, and the
prestige which the status of my literary patrons, cannot fail to confer ; but
literary support to my second volume, in the shape of “oi'iginal contributions”
of merit, will be most valuable of all.
Secretary. —l will make known your wishes in this respect. But have I
not heard that one of your old cadet pupils here, is a Poet of some merit ?
Author. —Who can that be ? Sir George Grey, of the Cape, is an author
(and I have this very day been reading his last work, on the “Mythology of
New Zealand”), but I am not aware of his being poetical ; nor have I heard the
“soft impeachment” attributed to my friend the Chief Commissioner of the
Gold-fields, or to Captain Baxter, or Mr. Gates of the Customs, Geelong,
which are all that I bring to recollection of my old pupils now here. But if
you can forage him out, pray lay the Poet under contribution to the “ Austral-
Asian Muse,” edited by his former preceptor.
Secretary. —Assuredly. It may not, however, be amiss to remind him,
when found, of Sir Philip Sidney’s doctrine, laid down in his “ Defence of
Poesy,” that “ such must not be drawn by the ears ; it must be gently led, or
rather it must lead ; which was partly the cause that made the learned ancient
affirm, it was a divine, and no human skill, since all other knowledge lies
ready for any that have strength of wit. A Poet no industry can make, if his
own genius be not carried into it ; and therefore is an old proverb, ‘ Orator
fit: Poeta nascitwr.' ” But my sentiments on the “Art divine,” are embodied
by George Wither, in these lines :
“ Poesy ! thou sweet’st content,
That e’er Heaven to mortals lent;
Though they as a trifle leave thee,
Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee
Though thou be to them a scorn,
That to nought but Earth are born ;
Let my life no longer he,
Than I am in lore with thee /”
Secretary of the Philosophical Institute. —The United Societies, Sir, of which
you are a member, viz. the Victorian Institute of Science, of which you
were one of the originators, and its junior rival the Philosophical Society,
now happily united under the title of the “ Philosophical Institute of Victoria,”
have deputed to me the honour of waiting upon you, as a member of their
body, to express their cordial concurrence in the principle of your proposals
in your “Question of Questions,” which go still further than those of your


friend the Hon. Member for Grant, and their desire and intention to give to
you, as a literary coadjutor, all the support in their power—of course they
desire for their library a copy of your “ Austral-Asian Muse.” But it is more
particularly on a subject of a scientific nature, with respect to which you are
known to be very zealous, and to which you are understood to have
devoted your attention several years, that I am instructed [to communicate
with you, viz. some new mode of propulsion, which you long since avowed
having discovered ; alleging, I believe, that your principle, if carried out,
would be calculated to supersede steam-power, as being perfectly, if not
equally, efficacious for propulsion, yet infinitely less expensive, and certainly
far from dangerous, being independent of fuel and of fire, and of any
explosive material, such as gas, or compressed air. Am I correct. Sir, as to
your avowal?
Author. —Perfectly correct; further, my “Victorian Motive-Power,”
though generally misunderstood as being applicable only to propulsion on the
water, is, on my word, equally applicable to railroads and common roads; and
also to grinding and saw mills, and machinery of all kinds, to which steam-
power is applicable; but, as you observe, at comparatively no expense, and
entirely free from the dangers incidental to the use of fire and steam.
Secretary. —Your discovery or invention is not, I believe, yet established
by any positive test; although it was brought under the notice of the Legis-
lative Council in August, 1852, and 1 know it is understood to have
been referred, by the Committee appointed to look into the matter, to some
gentlemen of science, for their opinions and for their evidence; on which it is,
of course, to be assumed that the Committee drew up their Report to the
House, that “they had afforded to Mr. Kentish ample opportunities for explain-
ing the nature of his discovery of a new motive-power; and they had likewise
had the advantage of receiving, on the same subject, the opinions of Mr. Ginn
and Mr. Brees, gentlemen of scientific attainment, in the service of the
government; —but while your Committee admit that Mr. Kentish is deserving
of considerable credit, for the originality of his conceptions, they, at the same
time, do not consider these sufficiently matured, to warrant them in recom-
mending an appropriation of public money for the purposes that Mr. Kentish
requires. Your Committee being under a promise of secrecy to Mr. Kentish,
are unable, in this Report, to enter into the merits of the case.”* May I ask,
* The Petition presented to the Legislative Council by Dr. Murphy, on the 24th Aug., 1852,
was to the effect that, “ Petitioner having discovered an entirely new mode of propulsion, more
convenient and economical, and less dangerous than Steam (as certified by six gentlemen
acquainted with the principle, each having confidence in its reality), prayed that the
Government would cause it to be tested on a carriage, a decked vessel, and a mill.” It is but
right to add, that Mr. Kentish is still better able to demonstrate his propulsive discovery now,
than was possible this time three years—much thought and attention having been given to the
subject continually from that time to the present.


was it not competent to the Committee, or their two scientific referees, t©
test the invention or principle, so as to have demonstrated its truth, or its
fallacy, by its success or its failure, on trial under your specific direc-
tions?
Author. —Most certainly. To attain this result, or even as a preliminary
matter, to obtain the professional opinion of disinterested persons, competent
to judge of my theory, and of my demonstration in a scientific point of view,
before incurring the expense of some few hundred pounds to give it a practical
test, was the very object of my application to my Country— i.e. to her Repre-
sentatives assembled in Council, with the Delegates representing the Govern-
ment, constituting our local Legislature. But not only was no test attempted
experimentally, even with a model, by the two gentlemen selected by the
Committee; but no investiyation whatever of my theory, took place by them;
and one of them most relied on, as being a high Government Official, and
supposed to be the very person of all others in the colony, by profession
best qualified to arrive at a sound conclusion, viz. Mr. Brees, at that time
“ Colonial Engineer,” never so much as looked at the plan and synopsis which
I confided to him for three days; but as he did not condescend, or give himself
the trouble, to break the seal of the envelope, or to have one single interview,
with me on the matter, beyond a few minutes’ conversation in the street;
it is somewhat evident that he was precisely as competent to form a judgment
or to offer a reliable opinion on the truth or fallacy of my alleged discovery,
or of the probabilities for or against its success, as you now are, and no more
so ! Disgusted at the treatment which I experienced in the matter —placing
some hopes on promises, which proved delusive—and influenced by feelings of
delicacy (which I have been long convinced was, under the circumstances,
entirely false delicacy), I have abstained from drawing public attention, or
even that of any one of my acquaintances, to the almost incredible but un-
doubted fact, which I am but too well able to prove, of my having been thus
treated by the Legislative Council; which is almost as bad, as I had been
previously treated in the matter by certain professing “friends.” Another
reason, and the strongest of all, for my remaining so long quiescent (which
very few persons could have had command over their feelings to do, believing,
as I have ever believed, and still do believe with the most unshaken confidence,
that lam in possession of a secret which, as soon as developed, will both
astonish and benefit mankind, more even than the steam-engine) has been the
hope and expectation to possess the ability to test my alleged propulsive
discovery fairly and fully, by experiment, on the Sandridge Railway, I con-
template, with permission of the Directors (which I cannot doubt will be
readily granted, for a purpose at once so novel and important, as that of
propelling their present train of carriages without the Engine, nearly or quite
as well as with it), with funds of my own, and without occasion to be indebted
for assistance to any human being—-i. e. farther than to the Machine Engineers


and Mechanics for fulfilling my orders, at the ordinary business price* for
Ca«h.*
In order, however, to establish what I have told you as to my treatment,
with respect to my application to the Legislative Council, I will confidentially
show you the identical letters which I addressed to Dr. Murphy, Chairman
of this Committee, at the time of their notable “ Report !” but you must
promise me not to make them public. Here they are, you can read :
“ To the Select Committee of the Legislative Council of Victoria, appointed
to inquire into and report upon an alleged New Motive Power, discov-
ered in this Colony by N, L. Kentish, which he has petitioned the
Council may be tested by three sufficient experiments on a vessel,
land carriage, and a mill.
Gentlemen,—Not having been present yesterday at your interview with
Messrs. Ginn and Brees, I am necessarily in ignorance of what has been stated
to you by, or may by you have been inferred from, the specific, or perhaps
vague and amhigwms intimation of the sentiments of those gentlemen; as it was
not my good fortune to be invited to exercise the privilege usually accorded
on similar occasions to the party interested, of eliciting from witnesses whose
evidence is material to the issue to be tried, testimony which he is aware that
from their knowledge of the facts of the case, they cannot fail to give, establishing
the point contended for, if pertinent questions he answered by them, which of
course may best be put, by the individual whose facts, in a peculiar sense, they
are, and who is aware of the witnesses’ privity to such.
I am given to understand by your respected chairman, that from what
passed at the interview with my two professional confidants, the committee
does not feel warranted in recommending to the Council to afford me the
assistance required and desired to test my propulsive inventions—the hona fide
character, of which is, and from the very moment of my exposition being
made to them, has been, as it could not but be acknowledged by the two gen-
tlemen whom you selected to judge of my discovery confided also to your
selves; and as I am assured by each unequivocally, that he perfectly admits the
* But I recognise an obligation, and a great one, on the part of every employer to the
tradesmen, professional men, mechanics, and labourers, -who execute his wishes, although
paid for doing so; and assuredly if the carrying-out my ideas enable me to achieve (as I
have never for an instant doubted that, when carefully carried out they will do) an object
second in importance to not one in the whole World of physics (for if a new and infallible mode
of propulsion, free from the danger of explosion, and from the expense and burthen of fuel, be
less wonderful, who will doubt its importance, its utility and its benefit to mankind, being
greater than even the Electric Telegraph, which may, probably, in very few years, encircle the
Globe?) If such should be the case, must I not ever feel an obligation to those persons who
shall have been (though paid agents) instrumental to my success; in a manner somewhat
analagous to that which any man of well regulated mind must feel towards the sailors who,
by their valour, rescued him from drowning, although they acted under the orders of their
captain, and in his pay ?


soundness of the principle on whch my mode of propulsion is based, and that as
soon as it shall have been established by experiment, he will be prepared fur-
ther to admit the positive infallibility as well as efficacy, of my Victorian dis-
covery ; I cannot imagine that even the most extreme cautiousness—which the
dread of the possibility of committing themselves as men of science, by admit-
ting too much, may have excited—could induce men of honour and talent' to
compromise the interests of the World, which are identical with those of the
privileged discoverer-—by intentionally leading you to infer that they do not
deem my novel principle worth experimenting on; which would obviously im-
ply, that their doubts of its success amount to a confident expectation of its
failure, and disbelief of the reality of the power—which I know to be the op-
posite to their expectation (and may I not add, to yours ?) I therefore feel it
necessary, respectfully and earnestly to request, that before making your Re-
port to the Legislative Council, you will be good enough to apply to Mr. Ginn
and Mr. Brees for the favour of explicit answers to these three simple but
material questions, to be embodied in such Report, viz.—
1. Do you believe the principle in Science and in Physics on which Mr. Ken-
tish’s alleged propulsive power is based, to be sound ?
2. If, upon being tested by Mr. Kentish’s three proposed experiments on a
vessel, a locomotive carriage, and a mill—the reality and efficacy of his
alleged Victorian motive-power be established ; will it, in your opinion,
be calculated to supersede or, in some cases, to be employed in prefer-
ence to steam ; and to benefit the World by achieving propulsion by a
new means, either more economical , or more convenient and portable , or
less dangerous, or more powerful, than Steam—all, or either ?
3. What sum do you apprehend may be sufficient to establish the reality, or
fallacy, of Mr. Kentish’s alleged discovery of a new motive-power, by
experiment, on a cutter, a cart or carriage, and on a mill ?
Aware that no recommendation of yours —no vote of the Legislature—no
assistance of individuals or of Government — can give efficacy to my principle,
if wrong ; and that no opposition of Government, of Council, or of “ men of
science,” added to the repulses of my fellow-colonists (which,'with the insince-
rity of “ professing friends” —the prejudice and it may be jealousy of ignorance,
causing incredulity—and the proverbial apathy of this community, I have had
to contend with for years, because destitute of pecuniary resources), can pos-
sibly defeat its ultimate triumph, if lam right ; although these may still further
delay, as they have so long parried off, the introduction and adoption of my
Victorian propulsion;—it is most astonishing, and does appear almost incred-
ible, that you should not deem my propulsive inventions of sufficient impor-
tance to be tested-by experiments, despite the most positive testimony of six
gentlemen of intelligence, whose certificates you hold —especially those of Mr.
Kerr and Mr. Hurrey—who avow, from knowledge, that “ they are convinced
(as is Mr. Dow, the Engineer) of it being impossible that the application of my


principle to propulsion can failsupported, if I am not greatly mistaken, by
the impression of yourselves, now acquainted with my simple, but impor-
tant secret; and confirmed by the testimony of two men of science ; one of
whom, Mr. Brees, is made acquainted with the principle (but that is all, for
he has not so much as opened my papers, but intimated that to go into the
subject thoroughly, in all its details, might occupy some twenty or thirty days,
which, at ten or twelve guineas a day, would astonish the Committee!) and
the other of whom, Mr. Ginn, has been good enough to go carefully through
my synopsis—(about fifty pages exclusive of diagrams) — both of whom assure
me , that “ they perfectly admit my principle,” although they hesitate to express
officially a confident opinion on the subject, until the theory—which they admit
to be sound and indubitable—shall have been converted into practice, by ex-
perimental tests, which they have expressed a great desire to see applied.
I say, Gentlemen, that, under these circumstances, it is to me quite incom-
prehensible how, as a Committee, you can possibly arrive at the conclusion
that you are not warranted in recommending assistance to be granted me to
test an alleged discovery of confessedly vast importance; but it cannot be
known, till tested and established, how vast!
If it be alleged by the Engineers, whom you have had before you (as I
understand to be the case), that “ they are not perfectly acquainted, with the
various and intricate details, on which much must depend, and, therefore
are not prepared" to speak positively as to the amount of power attainable, or
the degree in which success may be expected to attend experiments for testing
the Victorian discovery I beg leave to state, most emphatically, that it
can be no fault of mine, if they be not thoroughly acquainted with my whole
scheme, in every, even the minutest particular; for, I most unequivocally
and unreservedly explained to them, orally, the grand principle in which my
propulsive discovery mainly consists ; when (like every other person who has
been let into my secret), they immediately acknowledged, and appeared to be
satisfied of, the infallable certainty of my arrangement to compel propulsion, as
soon as applied to wheels or paddles ; and I personally delivered to, and left
with, those gentlemen, my synopsis complete, for their investigation at leisure,
which remained four or five days at the Colonial Architect’s Office, when Mr.
Ginn returned the papers to me, with his assurance that he had read through
and examined the whole—but Mr. Brees had not found time to look at them—
which, being full and explanatory, are necessarily voluminous.
Now could I have imagined, or deemed it possible, that either of these my
Professional Brothers, could entertain a shadow of doubt with respect to a
palpable fact in physics, relating to a branch of science, which as Civil
Engineers, they must or ought to be familiar with, enabling them to under-
stand my principle when expounded to them, as well without, as an ignorant
person would by witnessing the experiment; I would have spared myself the
disclosure, which at your suggestion I have made to them, apparently without


answering the slightest purpose: indeed I should have thought it just as
necessary, in support of the doctrine of specific gravity, to exhibit to them
Newton’s demonstration of an apple falling from a tree, or a stone pushed otf
the top of a wall, in order to convince them that its own weight will bring any
solid to the ground, if unsupported ; as to do more than I have done by ex-
planation, in illustration of my propulsive principle, to men of science ; hut as
they (like the rest of the world, including the unscientific public), will be
satisfied with nothing less than “physical demonstration and as lam told
that you Gentlemen, do not propose to recommend the Government to aid
me with the means of demonstrating, by fair and full experiments, the reality
and efficacy of my alleged Victorian motive-power, until after I shall have
myself demonstrated by experiment, and thereby established the same: —l
have this day taken steps for the purpose, though on a very small scale, in
conformity with my limited means ; and I trust in a short time to remove the
doubts of the incredulous, and of the public at large; after which , any govern-
ment aid will be just too late to confer any very great service on the World,
which may benefit by the introduction of a new, cheap, safe, and powerful
Victorian propulsion; or on the privilged, yet fated discoverer and inventor :
patronage and support, however desirable, and it may be essential, in bringing
a novel principle into notice, being superfluous—if not worthless, when the
value of the same is acknowledged and appreciated.
I Will, therefore, in conclusion, request of you three favours, which it may
not be unreasonable to expect of the Committee, which kindly undertook to
act with me, viz.:—Ist, That according to your promise, on honour, you will
be good enough to keep my secret, and not breathe a hint of its nature to any
one 2nd, If you do not recommend to the Council, to sanction tests being
applied to my motive power, that you will be pleased, by silence on this point ?
to abstain from influencing that body to my prejudice—which, stating that
“ you do not recommend assistance to be afforded me,” would obviously be
doing; and—3rd, That in your Report, drawn up as you deem most proper,
you will be good enough to embody my three queries, with the answers of
Messrs. Ginn and Brees, which I believe will convey the gist of the informa-
tion desired by the Legislative Council, and by the Colonists of Victoria.
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
Your humble and obedient Servant,
N. L. KENTISH.*
Audit Office,
November 2nd, 1852.
* Had Mr. Kentish been honoured with any reply to this or any other letter addressed to
the Committee, he would not be guilty of the disingeuuousness of suppressing such.


Audit Office,
November Bth, 1852.
To F. Murphy, Esq., M.L.C., etc., etc., etc.
Sir, —May I beg the favour to be furnished with a copy of the Report of
Committee, to the Legislative Council; and, also, to have returned to me
(having no perfect copy) the letter which was left for you and the Committee,
at the Council Chamber yesterday morning— too late, I fear, to have been
received and perused, until after your Report was prepared and signed.
Without intending, and I trust without giving, the slightest offence to
yourself and the Gentlemen of the Committee—whose conscientious discharge
of a duty which they politely took upon themselves, I have no desire to
impugn, but on the contrary, whose courtesy I have great pleasure in
acknowledging; I feel it to be due to myself, and to .the great interests of
the public, inseparable from my still alleged but untested propulsive discovery,
to explain publicly a misapprehension, under which the Committee must
have laboured, in stating that “ my plan is not matured;'’ for it actually is, and
has for many months been so thoroughly matured in all its details, even to the
minutest particular, that if I had unlimited funds at command, to test my
several inventions at this moment, I would have nothing to do but direct
certain mechanics and others, to “ follow implicitly the instructions contained
in the synopsis,” which Mr. Ginn had in his possession several days. Indeed
if my life were to terminate this instant, my successor could carry out my
plans without the slightest difficulty ; for nothing more could be 'done by me
till the machinery is put in hand, than I have already pointed out clearly in
.detail: although improvements may, and doubtless will, be made in my
proposed arrangements, when experience shall have shown in what particu-
lars, the details or minutiae, may be susceptible of improvement; hut the
principle is unalterable.
I find that the Engineers to whom 1 referred you, stated to the effect, that
“ they had not sufficiently made themselves acquainted with the details” (which in
my synopsis are very full) “to give a confident opinion;” and I also know
that they expected to be requested by the Committee to examine into the
same, and, after having done so, to report more fully as well as explicitly—
and I have strong reasons for believing that they would have answered, and
yet ivill answer, my proposed queries, if put to them, in the affirmative.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your humble and obedient servant,
N. L. KENTISH.
P.S. —Please also to return my letter addressed to Mr. Brees.
With respect to that most important of circumstances, funds—l have been
again defeated, and thrown upon my “ beam-ends,” by the “ Government re-
ductions,” by which, it is well known, I am still a sufferer, and have been six


months, or 1 should now have means at command sufficient to answer the
only purpose I require, viz., to establish my principle, if I be right in my
theory (and to give my enemies a laugh at my expense, if wrong); but at
jeast to place the question beyond all doubt. If, on the fair application of
my magic power, the wheels will not move; whilst laughing at my discomfi-
ture, the laughers will soon detect and expose my error ; but if it should hap-
pen, not to deceive me by any unconquerable obstinacy, but should propel in
conformity with my wishes, by means of the magic powder shaken over the
wheels ; that first object attained (and I declare on honour , without the slight-
est confederacy with the Great Wizard of the South) —the object of primary
importance will be accomplished, and all the desiderated results will assuredly
follow ; which I will not permit myself to indulge in, by anticipation. Man
is mortal: lam a man—and therefore I may be mistaken. I have already
said, I believe I shall not be, in this matter ; but even, if so, when my ideas
become known and understood, fools only will laugh—men of science will
afford me their sympathy, and philosophers will kindly remark that a mistake
is not a crime. And who will have the hardihood to assert that the disclosure
to the scientific world, of the “ notions” which the Committee of the Legisla-
tive Council have —either upon their own opinion, or upon that of the late
Colonial Architect, Mr. Ginn, or generally on both—officially declared to
be “ original ! ” [which is the only merit, and precisely the merit —however
humble it may prove —that I claim !] and entitling the discoverer of it to
some commendation ;— who, I ask, will venture to be quite sure, that the dis-
closure of my original conception and design, w ill be unprofitable to the w'orld
of science ? Who will bet great odds, that, with respect to, an entirely new mode
of propulsion, the humble Author of this “ Question of Questions,” in Vic-
toria, may not yet be privileged, after years of discomfiture and repulses, to
adopt—as Fulton enjoys the undying fame of having done with respect to
“ propulsion by steam” —the triumphant exclamation of Archimedes—
“ Eureka !”—I have found it out.*
* For the information of the juvenile reader, it may not be uninteresting to mention the
circumstance which gave occasion to the great philosopher and mathematician of antiquity, to
utter exultingly and stark-naked in the streets of Syracuse, this celebrated ejaculation, viz.,
the great discovery which he had that instant made, by the immersion of his own body in a
small bath full to the brim, causing it to overflow as he stepped into the water, which Archi-
medes immediately proved and established by analysis, viz., that “ every body heavier than its
bulk of water, loses so much of its weight by being suspended in water, as is equal to the weight
of a quantity of water equal to its bulk,” by which discovery he forthwith solved the problem
which he at that time had under investigation for Hiero, King of Syracuse, viz., the proportion
of metal of weight inferior to gold, with 'which the jeweller had alloyed a certain quantity of
pure gold, which the King had entrusted to him to make into a crown. This, Archimedes
/ found out;” and by the same means Dr. Davy or any other scientific person may detect spu-
rious gold, if again attempted to be palmed off by any of our miners-or others.


Secretary. —Would your scruples cause you to resist the disclosure of your
secret to your co-members of the Philosophical Institute ?
Author, —I would have not the slightest objection, but the greatest pleasure,
in confiding my ideas and my design to the President and any one other suit-
able gentleman, under the most positive pledge of secresy ; but even this,
I would wish to defer, until one piece of machinery be completed; and, as
soon as that can be effected, my scruples will cease, and I shall be delighted
to communicate my ideas unreservedly to every man of science who may hon-
our me with his attention ; and be most thankful for the favour of their
candid opinion—whether favourable or adverse to my wishes; and will
be sincerely grateful for the valuable suggestions which yourself and many
of our associates may be able, and I trust, kind enough, to give me the benefit
of, which however, I must do myself the justice to declare, I would scorn to
avail myself of, without permission, or without publicly avowing the obligation
and its author; for I deem that honour and honesty require the strict obser-
vance of the maxim— “ Palmam qui meruit feral.”
Secretary. —Then, if I apprehend you aright, as soon as you shall have got
one important—l presume fundamental—part, of your machinery or apparatus
completed and adjusted ; that probably to contain your “ magic powder”—
(being neither fire, air, steam, nor gas of any kind)—which is to produce your
motive-power—you will consent to reveal your secret, and explain every
thing, to a committee of two or three members of the Philosophical Institute,
without waiting for a full and perfect test, which may perhaps be attended
with considerable delay, as well as outlay.
Author. —Exactly so ; and I shall have great pleasure in nominating as
such Committee, to be confidentially made the depositaries of my secret, our
respected and talented President and yourself, as having been the Secretary
of the first, and now of the United Society, which has for its object the
advancement of Science, Philosophy, and Literature ; and though I have an
objection to a numerous Committee on a matter to remain for the present
strictly secret; yet if you two Gentlemen honour me with your attention, I am
quite willing that you should associate with you any one Gentleman of our
Society, whom you may deem most suitable to consult with. But before any
such arrangement take place, I could wish it to be understood that the three
questions which I wished put to Messrs. Brees and Ginn, by Dr. Murphy
and the Committee of the Legislative Council—but which never were put to
those Gentlemen —shall be answered by the Committee of the Philosophical
Institute, after they shall have been put in possession, by myself, of the pro-
pulsive secret, and examined and considered what I shall lay before them.
Secretary. —I will communicate your explicit and explanatory reply to the
Society, to which I cannot doubt that it will be satisfactory, from its candour.
Author. —ln the meanwhile, I have the honour to solicit of the Philo-
sophical Institute, through you, Sir, the favour of a reply to the following


queries, not irrelevant to the matter under discussion, which, you will per-
ceive, relate to philosophical and mechanical (not to medical /) scienc'e,
viz.:—
What is understood by “ perpetual motion ?”
What is its proper definition ?
What would constitute and be accepted as “perpetual motion,” according
to the meaning intended by the Royal Society of England, which very many
years ago offered a reward (of £lO,OOO, I think), yet to he awarded, for the
discovery of perpetual motion ?
In the language of mortals, and relating to the period in which they have
existence on earth, called “ Time,” perpetual cannot mean eternal, can it ?
If not, what number of years, or of generations, or what other measure, is to
determine the import and signification of mundane “ perpetual motion ?”
Would a machine so constructed as to continue in uniform motion
for very many years (and that regular motion powerful, and capable of
being imparted to other mechanical agents) with so little friction as to be
capable of continuing, and adapted to continue in operation, with undimi-
nished efficiency for ages, in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature ;
and if at the end of one or more centuries requiring renovation or repaii’, as
capable of being repaired or renovated, as it was possible to be constructed; —
would it be admitted by the Royal Society of 1855, or would it not be admitted
to constitute fairly and bona fide “perpetual motion?” Would such discovery,
upon its disclosure and demonstration or proof by one year’s trial, entitle its
author to the not inglorious fame of having discovered and achieved the long
desiderated, and long despaired of, wonder of the world:—would this entitle him
to the Royal Society’s not unsubstantial premium, offered for the “ discovery
of perpetual motion?”
John Bull. —Aye, that’s right, Mr. Scratchetary. Ibe well pleased with
this conversation, and hopes the Philosophical Institute will institute philo-
sophical and scientific investigation into the alleged discovery of our Victorian
friend, the Hawther of the “ Question of Questionsvor if he be as roight in
his notions about driving ships, coaches, and railway trains without steam, as
he be in his plan for putting the plough and the seed into the ground, and
getting plenty of vood out of the ground, in this Colony, so as to secure pro-
sperity and a cheap loaf (which be the best promoters of peace!) I bainf sure
which ’ll be the greatest benefit; though zartainly, his advice, if acted on,
for putting the land into the possession of varmers that ’ll cultivate it, will be
of sarvice to this Colony, or say to Australia, only, or principally; but a new,
cheap, and safe mode of steaming, I was going to say, without steam, wool
benefit the whole world. I heard and read a good deal about this Victorian
discovery of Mr. Kentish’s new motive-power, in the Illustrated News, and in
the Edinburgh papers, when I was in my own country—that’s England—four
years ago. [To Author]: —Well, son, Ibe rejoiced to zee the turn that things be


loikely to take in thy vavor. This affair of thy motive-power, if it he hut
brought to bear according to thy hopes and expectations-^*nc? mine, Zur —in
this Colony, as well as having been revealed to thy mental vision in it, may
well be called the “ Victorian Motive-Power,” in honour of Victoria’s coun-
try and Victoria Queen, who will be more ready to acknowledge thy services
than thy fellow-Colonists, in and out of Parliament, have shown themselves;
and if this be once fairly established, thy “ Australian Muse ” will sing I
s’pose for amusement, and thee wilt publish for honour only instead of profit.
Author. —Just so, friend Bull. But though 1 confidently hope and ex-
pect soon to be able to exclaim “ Eureka!” —fie., I have found out a new,
cheap, convenient, and infallible mode of propulsion ; and to hear the World
exclaim, “ he has found it out —I refrain from asserting that such will and
must be the case—because a fool is positive, and a positive person is generally
wrong; but if I prove to be right, I shall rejoice for the World at large, I
trust, without undue exultation at the distinguished privilege which in such case
will be admitted (but only because it can be no longer denied or resisted) to
pertain to the humble Author of the “ Question of Questions, in Victoria” —
and I shall, in such case, have but little occasion, time, or inclination, to
trouble myself about other matters of comparatively little interest or impor-
tance, to myself or to the public. But adverting not to what mdy be, but to
what is, the case at present; the prospect of issuing the “ Austral-Asian
Muse,” in two volumes, with credit and with profit, by a goodly list of sub-
scribers, is most cheering.
Mr. Bull. —Yes ; thee may’st already reckon a goodly number. Let me
see: all the addresses presented to thee by the fraternities which glory in thy
fellowship—each ordering some, and several ordering a vast number of copies,
—here they be : Ist, the Legislative Council; 2nd, the Mayors and Corpora-
tions of Melbourne aud Geelong; 4th, the Agriculturists ; sth, the Squatters ;
6th, thy Eellow-Colonists and Government Officers of Victoria; Bth, ditto of
New South Wales ; 10th, ditto of South Australia; 12, ditto of Van Diemen’s
Land ; 14,15, 16, Surveyors, Engineers, and Architects ; 17, 18, the Army and
Royal Military College; 19, the Navy; 20, Medical Profession; 21, the
Aborigines but I s’pose they don’t count, so we will take the next for 21,
the Native Youths; 22, the New Zealanders —do they count? —[ Author . —
Yes, certainly; they are both English' scholars and Christians.] —23, the
Christian Church; 24, the Press ; 25, the Diggers—and their order alone, I
s’pose, may be taken at 10,000 copies, at least: and especially the Schools.
Author. —With such a connection as a quarter of a century of active and
not unuseful life in Australia, has formed for me in the several Colonies, I can
hardly permit a doubt that, amongst half-a-million of Colonists, a few copies
of a work of Australian, Tasmanian, and New Zealand Literature, of local
interest in each Colony, may peradventure receive sufficient support to be
serviceable to me, and to enable me to be serviceable to my fellow men : viz.,


one in 100 would give me riches —one even in 200 would do me service—but
less than one to 300 or 400, would inflict on me loss of both money, and time.
Mr. Bull. —My Son, I commend thee to all my children in this hemisphere.
Author. —There are about five-and-twenty copies ordered, then, exclusive
of the Diggers.
Mr. Bull. —Yive-and-twenty what ? copies ? hundreds, if not thousands,
are nearer the mark. Take the fust.
Author. —That is, “ one for the Legislative Council.”
Air. Bull. —One ! nonsense, man alive ! One for each Legislative Coun-
cillor ; Ihe witness to that. That’s sixty, ain’t it ? bezides the Clerks of
the Council, etc.
Author. —You are a capital constructor, Mr. Bull; that you are ! Then I
suppose I am to understand one for each Squatter, and one for each Agri-
culturist ?
Mr. Dull. —Certainly!
Author. —How then, about the Army and Navy ? I understood one for
each “service.”
Mr. Bull. —Well, that would be funny ! they’d have some travelling and
voyaging too, to be seen by all the Eegiments and all the Men-of-war! Send
them at least one to each Regiment, and three to each ship of the line, for the
Officers.
Author— To your order, most worthy Pater I but I must have the plea-
sure to present the same number to the non-commissioned Officers, Soldiers,
and Sailors.
Mr. Bull. —Thee shouldst print off not fewer than 20,000 copies, which, at
a guinea each, I should hope will net thee a profit of one-third ; but I be well
aware that by a single thousand, you would net nothing but trouble; and
that to print vive hundred only, you would be negrly as many pounds out of
pocket.
Author. —Your judgment is perfectly correct: but as I have great scruples
in adopting your construction as to the orders given by the various Gentlemen
who honoured me with the presentation of their addresses ; 1 shall request my
Publisher to apply to them respectively, for more specific instructions as to
the names of “ subscribers.”
Mr. Bull. —Do so. ,

The Author, respectfully to the Purchaser, being an adult; —
Sir, or Madam, —
If being of a grave and thoughtful turn of mind, you have felt
au interest in the perusal of the first pages of my “ Question of
Questions,” it is quite possible that it may be my misfortune to be blamed for
having appended to it the latter pages of frivolity ; but if I happen to be
addressing a person of very lively temperament, more pleased with fun and
frolic, than with political economy ; and less interested in cheap land, than in
a merry song; in such case, it is not impossible that thfe grave question of
colonial policy, with respect to the alienation of Crown land, may be deemed
unpardonably dry (and that of water, intolerably wet). Happily, however,
for poor me, there is a third and a very large party, who deem it no verv
heinous offence in an author, to exercise his privilege of driving his grey goose
quill “ From grave to gay—from lively to severe.”
But to each, and all, of the adult purchasers of this book, I beg leave
distinctly to give notice, that the latter half is neither written for, nor sold to,
nor does it belong to, them - but is affectionately presented by the author to those
of his friends for whom he cherishes the most lively regard, viz. those dear little
unsophisticated friends, who have “not yet attained to their teens:” and he
accordingly, informs the juvenile reader, that if papa or mamma, uncle or
aunt, bought the “ Question of Questions,” we, the author, do hereby present
unto the purchaser’s child or children, the last pages of this most inter-
esting work, foi -juvenile amusement only; as the Publisher has sold the first
forty-nine pages, for papa's or uncle’s edification !
In witness of which, our Deed of Gift, unto the said little son (or daughter)
of the said purchaser—provided he be able to read and “ toorle, loorle”—we
have hereunto subscribed our name, this 20th day of August, Anno Domini
1865. God save the Queen !
The Author, his
Witness,
The Publisher.
It having been suggested to us by our intelligent “ Printer’s Devil," that
there will be several pages of “disputed property” betwen Papa and “ the Boy,"
each of whom is likely to claim Mr. Bull as his own; we have anxiously
considere d the important point raised, and are sorely perplexed as to the
equity of the case ; which, if referred to the three learned Judges, will, doubt-
less, be righteously decided by their Honors —that all the sense and land advan-
tages pertain to “Papa,” and all the fun and nonsense to the “Boy.” Bu t
which is sense, and which nonsense ? that's the Question ! and that important
question is referred to the arbitration of Mamma, who is to be saluted jvith a
fee by each suitor, on making her award.
The AUTHOR!

The Publishers respectfully intimate—that as this pamphlet is issued
by the Author, not with a view to profit, but to disseminate his sug-
gestions amongst the Legislators and leading men in Victoria and in
the several sister Colonies—as well as amongst his extensive circle
of friends, acquaintances, and fellow Colonists throughout this Hemi-
sphere ; in the hope of thereby giving effect to his effort to he useful —
the publishing price, will be received at 44 Collins Street West, of
such Readers as may voluntarily pay the same in aid of the cost of
printing, which is no trifle in Melbourne, at current wages.
N.B.—Subscribers’ names (a list of which will be published,) also
received to the “ Australasian Muse,” as announced inside of cover.
N.B. The Gentlemen at the various Diggings are informed, that there being
a very limited number of copies of this Pamphlet, the author has issued tha
Gold-diggers’ and other Songs separately, for the convenience of his musical,
and especially of his vocal, friends —to be had, in general, at the Post Office*
or principal Storekeepers, on each Gold-field.
Although Papa has a right to write his name in the front page of this
“ Question of Questions” book, because that belongs to him, which he bought
and paid for, that’s right enough; yet as he only bought down to page 49,
I have a right to write mg name on all of the pages from page 50, down to
here, ’specially on all those that have Songs, and “ toorle loorlc,” in them;
as I’ve a right to have them, and to sing them too, —’cause all those that
have got any “fun” in them were not given nor sold to Papa, nor yet to any
grown-up person, but they are affectionately presented by the Author —jolly
old feller ! —to the schoolboy (that’s me—ain’t that prime ?)
