INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
i
?Those who ignore the Past will take hut little heed of the
Future .?
This little book will prove to be but a continuation, and in
some respects at least a supplementation, of the old records
contained in the first volume of ?The Good Old Days of the
Hawkesbury.? I am deeply indebted for a deal of the infor-
mation covering its pages to the close research work done by
many enthusiastic ?Australiana? students; whilst I have my-
self lost no opportunity which presented itself of gathering
from all sorts of unexpected sources authentic notes regarding
early pioneers, their doings and sayings, and all that seemed
worth recording about the times in which they lived ?the good
old times for which all true men wear perpetual mourning.?
There is a charm in the matter of writing and reading the
simple history of the days that now are dead. Lord Lytton
has given immortality to the sentiment in those lines of his
with which I conclude this brief introductory note: The
past lives in words; a thousand ages were blank if books had
not evoked their ghosts and kept the pale embodied shades to
warn us from fleshless lips .... There is no Past so long
as books shall live. 55

THE RIVER HAWKESBURY.
I 1 rom the rising of these mountains , I did not doubt hut
that a large river would be found? ?Governor Phillip.
So spake Phillip?he who served that land
Whose standard proudly waves o?er every sea;
W hose ships, by bold and fearless seamen mann?d,
Have left their mark on every foreign strand, ?
Whose sailors fought to set the bondsmen free)
So spake he, when, like the fair Cybelle,
He saw the hills and strove to reach their feet,
And pictured there some rich, sequestered dell,
W here waters met and murmured as they fell,
And air, like song of birds, was pure and sweet.
??Then felt he like some watcher of the skies
W hen a new planet swims into his ken,?
For as he gazed afar with wistful eyes,
He felt that here a settlement might rise,
And prove a home of happiness to men.
He d dreamed of such a place and dreamed again,
And as he stood within the shadows gray,
Again he dreamed that o?er a boundless plain,
Through vales and rugged gorges to the main
A noble river rippled on its way.
******
And after months of weary search, ?twas shown
That Phillip?s judgment has not erred?a stream
As great in volume as the rushing Rhone,
the broad Moselle or Hudson, here had grown
In ages past and gone. Thus Phillip?s dream
Was realised. Around in slumber lay
?Dark frowning heaths grown bright with Ceres? store,?
And as at early morn the sun's bright ray
Fell flashing on the river far away,
?Twas such a sight as he?d not seen before.
******
Through woods the party marched, and natives fled,
And safety sought in habitations rude;
They ne?er had seen a white man, and the dread
Of danger seized them, as the measured tread
Of armed men disturbed their solitude.
More friendly tribes approached them, bowing low
7


And showing no alarm, as Phillip?s men
Bestowed their gifts of beads and knives, and so
Induced their dusky friends the way to show
O?er paths known but by forest denizen.
The natives led them to a scene most fair
And beautiful; and from a neighbouring height
Rich country, destined later on to bear
The fruits of honest toil, was seen where?er
The vision ranged ?before, to left and right.
From Richmond Hill* so picturesque and wild,
They saw through Lansdowne and Carmarthen?s mist
Avoca?s lovely vale, where undefoled,
Venrubbin met the Grose, and like a child
Joined hands, and mingled tears and sweetly kis?t ?
Then onward flowed, and gathered as it went
New vigour from the streams whose waters fell
Into its channel, broad and continent!
Thus golden sky and flower-clad uplands lent
A charm which only poet-tongue can tell.
�***�*
And as on Richmond Hill they lay at eve,
And heard the cascade o?er the mountain roll,
What thoughts in Phillip?s mind did fancy weave,
What dainty pictures did his brain conceive,
What hopes or fears did animate his soul?
Did e?er he in prophetic moments dream,
As peeped he o?er the Future?s horizon,
That either bank of that broad silver stream
Ere long with sturdy yeomanry would teem,
Or did he think the trials undergone
By other men like him, who dangers braved
Of flood and field and savage hate and fear
Would naught avail? He from such fears was saved,
For in fair Austral?s sunny land he paved
The way for many another pioneer
Who followed him in years, and helped to build
A nation up, whose growth is marvellous;
Whose broad, prolific acres now are till?d
By men, with noble aspirations filled
"To make their native country prosperous.
***** *
Could Phillip stand on Richmond Hill and gaze
Across the fields now rich in gold and green,
* Now known as Belmont,

THE EIYEE HAWKESBUEY


And note the change which Time has wrought since day'
When mighty forests stood where yellow maize
Now ripens ?neath the summer?s silvery sheen.
Could he have lived to see the progress made
In scarce a hundred years, since valiant Ruse
And Williams tilled the soil of yonder glade
He?d sigh like Alexander, to invade
New worlds, and honest settlement induce.
He laboured well and nobly to secure
The welfare of his people, and he laid
Foundation for a State which will endure,
And grow in strength and wisdom, and mature,
And gain a lustre that will never fade!
* * * * * *
The Hawkesbury, famed for fruit and fragrant flow?rs,
Has in our history played a noble part:
Then let us pray that fortune?s favouring showers
Will freely fall, and make this land of ours
A home of science, literature, and art.
Ruse?s grant was at the junction of the South Creek and
the Hawkesbury, whilst that of Williams adjoined it in Pitt
Reach, on the Hawkesbury. These holdings are now owned
by William and Alfred Hannabus respectively.

THOSE WERE THE DAYS
HISTORY OF THE HAWKESBURY DISTRICT.
We have no record of a bygone shame,
No red-writ histories of woe to weep;
God set our land in summer seas asleep
Till His fair morning for her leaking came.
?John Farrell.
This fine old land of ours is but a child,
Yet in a go-cart. Patience! Give it time
To learn its limbs; there is a hand that guides,
?Tennyson.
?WAY back in the dim red dawn of man,? when
Holland and France and Spain and Great Britain
were pitted each against the other as enterprising
rivals in the somewhat hazardous task of sailing
their modest ships into unknown seas, in search of
the new lands of the South, there came to the then
unexplored Continent of ?Australia? (for so it was
designated on the charts of the day), an intrepid
British navigator, one James Cook, who raised on one
of the most notable of its headlands the flag of his
country, taking of it full and complete possession
on behalf of his King and of the great Island nation
over which that potent Sovereign exercised sway.
Many were the brave sailormen of British and other
climes who had coursed their several ways in the
vicinity of the Great South Land long years before
11


Cook came hence, and as far back as 1605 Torres
really discovered the Continent of which he was in
search, but knew not that his task had been success-
fully accomplished; whilst in 1688 Captain William
Dampier, scientist, explorer, and author, made some
part of Australia, and left on record a statement to
the effect that he was doubtful as to whether it was
an island or a main continent, though certain that
it neither joined Asia, Africa, or America. In 1616,
Dirk Hartog landed on an island in Shark Bay
(W.A.), and nailed a tin plate to a post, to be found
eighty years afterwards by a Dutch navigator, Wil-
helm de Vlaming, who went ashore on the continent
in several places, and then sailed to New Guinea,
which he sighted on January 1, 1700.
Be all this as it may, the fact still remains that
James Cook sailed into Botany Bay not one whit too
soon, for close upon his heels w r as the Frenchman,
Comte De Laperouse, whose ships, the Boussel and
Astrolabe , reached the Terra Australis of the Dutch
(1664) just three days after the great Englishman had
taken possession. The whole history of Australia, in
the largest sense, hung upon this little big accident.
?Had destiny ordained it otherwise, the territory
would have been French instead of British and De
Laperouse would in all probability have been saved
the disaster that met the vessel in which he sailed,
which was lost on a coral reef shortly afterwards,
thus leaving his fate surrounded in complete mystery
for a period of over forty years.?
In the Old Country, a colonisation scheme was
promoted, and as the outcome of it Captain Phillip
set sail on board the Sinus, in command of the First
Fleet, on the 13th May, 1787, taking with him 756
men and women in the transports, with a full com-
plement of officers and marines, supplies, and all the
requisites necessary and obtainable to fully equip the
party for the successful accomplishment of the task
they had voluntarily and involuntarily undertaken.
12
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


His last message to Nepean was to some extent
prophetic: ? ? Once more I take my leave of you;. .. .
but at a future period, when this country (Great
Britain) feels the advantages that are to be drawn
from our intended settlement, you will enjoy the
satisfaction that will, I am sure, make you ample
amends.? Exactly 36 w r eeks from the day of sailing,
all Phillip?s ships were safe in their destined port;
of 212 marines only one had been lost; and of 775
convicts but 24 perished on the way.
Now let me deviate from these somewhat stereo-
typed introductory details ?though they have proved
most essential to a proper and thorough presentation
of a recital of the Hawkesbury?s early history?for
the landing of the expedition of 1787 and the dis-
covery and development of the district alluded to
proved well-nigh contemporaneous acts, and the record
of the one is inextricably intervowen with that of
the other. The initial difficulties in the matter of
housing the new-comers, and of establishing a settle-
ment, overcome, Captain Phillip, ?the little man with
a thin aquiline nose under a large cocked hat,? set
about spending such spare time as fell to his lot in
the making of tours of exploration; and his accom-
plishments in this direction rendered him worthy
of a greater meed of renown than the historians of
the past have vouchsafed him. He had faith in this
new dominion over which he was appointed to exer-
cise governmental authority; and, despite the fact
that there were many passimists about him (such, for
instance, as Surgeon White, who described it as ?a
country so forbidden and so hateful as only to permit
execrations and curses?), he sturdily maintained his
optimistic spirit, and indulged his prophetic fancy
to the full. What Marcus Clark denominated the
?phantasmagoria of that wild dreamland termed the
bush? had such temptations and attractions for him
that he daily penetrated the surrounding country,
and navigated the inlets and streams, and climbed
13
HISTORY OF THE HAWKEBBURY DISTRICT


the hills from which a broad expanse of ocean was
so plainly visible. His steps turned more than once
towards the fertile valley whose centenary was duly
celebrated in fitting fashion, and on one of these
jaunts, before he and his party had actually reached
their ultimate destination, he saw ?the great range
of mountains of which they had caught distant
glimpses on former occasions?they seemed suddenly
quite close, as if a veil of clouds had rolled away
in a moment; Phillip, generally happy in his selection
of names, called them the Blue Mountains.? Let the
Records now tell the tale:
?Towards evening they found themselves at the foot of
a mountain covered with lofty trees, but free from scrub;
the country all around being pleasant to look upon, rich
with grass, and without any of those rocky patches which
met their eyes so often in other directions. The charms
of the scenery led them to move some distance up the hill
before they camped. In the stillness of the night they
were startled by the roar of distant waters falling over,
reeks, and concluded at once that there was a cataract in
the way which would stop their progress up the river.
In order to satisfy themselves on that point, they walked to
the top of the hill next morning, when they saw an im-
mense range of mountains only five or six miles off;
between this range and the hill on which they stood ?
which Phillip had named Richmond Hill ?lay a deep
valley; while in the range itself they saw distinctly ?a
remarkable gully or chasm? about five miles away. On
each side of this gigantic gap stood two hills, which Phillip
had named the Carmarthen and Lansdowne Hills. ?. . . .
They found the intervening country perfectly clear of scrub,
the trees standing wide apart, and all of a great height;
the soil, too, was good; a small patch was turned up under
Phillip?s instructions, and a few potatoes, some Indian
corn, melons, and other seeds were sown.?
Thus were the noble reaches of the noble Hawkes-
bury first navigated, and their banks perfunctorily
explored, by this small band of white men, ? all armed
with musquets.? To them-the task of reaching the
base of that ?prodigious chain of lofty mountains,
running north and south further than the eye can


trace them,? seemed comparatively easy, though sub-
sequent events proved that they had sadly miscal-
culated both the distance and the difficulty; and it
was fully twenty-five years later before their summit
was reached. In 1789, Captain Tench travelled some
distance along the stream which is now called the
Nepean, and which later on (in 1791) was ascer-
tained to be really part and parcel of the Hawkes-
bury itself. The historian writes of the exploratory
achievements of Phillip thus :
?But for the discovery of the Hawkesbury, it would
hardly have been possible to have made any way at all
into the surrounding country. It was almost equivalent
to making a road. Followed, as it was shortly afterwards,
by the discovery of the Nepean, it enabled Phillip to gain
some insight into the character of the country inland.
Had the work of exploration been understood in his days,
the advantage thus gained might certainly have been
turned to better account. A depot, for instance, might have
been established at Richmond Hill, which would then have
become the basis for further operations. .. . His ex-
ploration of the Hawkesbury and of the country which lay
between it and the Sydney Cove not only rescued the
settlement from the peril of ultimate failure, but it may
be said to have laid the foundation of all subsequent dis-
coveries.?
The Hawkesbury, by the way, was so called after
the first Earl of Liverpool, Baron Hawkesbury, whilst
the aboriginal natives referred to it as Deerubbin,
or venrubbin.
In a Despatch dated April 29, 1794, Lieutenant
Governor Grose wrote : ? 4 4 1 have settled on the banks
of the Hawkesbury (and South Creek) twenty-two
settlers, who seem very much pleased with their farms.
They describe the soil as particularly rich, and they
inform me that whatever they have planted has grown
in the greatest luxuriance.? This little band of
agricultural co-operators, then, dumped down at the
settlement which Grose had christened The Green
Hills (which title was on December 13, 1810, changed
to Windsor) proved the nucleus of that larger and
15
HISTORY OF THE HAWKESHURY DISTRICT


more important wealth-producing centre which to-day
is renowned the whole of Australia across.
Their names deserve to be writ large upon the scroll
of fame: ?Giles Moore, Dan Barnett, W. Pawson, J.
Butler, T. Howell, J. Rous, C. Williams, J. Wimbow,
W. Snarlham, J. Acres, W. Douglas, J. Wright, J.
Fendlow, Peter Bond, J. Owen, E. Cunningham, R.
Davis, J. Roberts, Thos. Saunders, J. Webb, T.
Welsted, and Thos. Caldwell. Rous had been farm-
ing at Rose Hill (Parramatta) prior to gravitating
to the Hawkesbury; he had proved his prowess as a
farmer, and was given one of the best areas at the
new settlement.
On December 13, 1810, by a Government and
General Order, five separate townships in the Hawkes-
bury and Nepean districts were ordered to be marked
out, and to bear the names of Windsor, Richmond,
Pitt Town, Wilberforce and Castlereagh. Roads from
the central settlement at Farm Cove, through Rose
Hill (Parramatta) had been constructed to Windsor
and Richmond, and the Records show that Governor
Lachlan Macquarie?who was a frequent visitor to
the Hawkesbury, and responsible for the establish-
ment of some of its earliest and most valuable insti-
tutions ?brought into existence a system of road and
river tolls, with the object of raising revenue with
which to keep these thoroughfares in order. Thrive?s
bridge was erected over South Creek at Windsor, and
was opened in 1813; whilst a ferry service was estab-
lished to connect Wilberforce with Windsor.
Then the population gradually grew, and all the
requisites of a civilised community came by-and-bye
to be supplied?the hospital, the court house, public
granaries for the housing of the farmers? produce,
the church and school, and all the other features of
a well-ordered community. And as at Windsor, so
the same set of conditions operated at the other ad-
jacent centres of Richmond, Wilberforce, Pitt Town
and Castlereagh. And all the time these settlements
16
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


progressed?there came drought, and flood, and
tempest, and all these carried destruction in their
train; but there were the seasons of plenty that more
than made good the losses of other years. And the
sons grew up to man?s estate, and their fathers went
hence after life?s grim toil had been done, and left
the continent the richer and the better for their efforts
as colonists and producers. In the district cemeteries
the names of some of the heroes of early days are
to be found recorded on crumbling tombstones, but
the great bulk of them have left no mark of their
existence save in a general way. Yet they one and
all played their parts in the tragedy of life, and
bore the heat and burden of those days of alternate
sunshine and despair with a fortitude worthy of the
warmest possible commendation.
As the ?granary of Young Australia,? the Hawkes-
bury furnished for years the raw material needed
for the maintenance of the main settlement ?in fact,
at more than one period of the early existence of
the colony, the whole population was dependent upon
it for foodstuffs; and we have Captain Collins writing
in this strain on the subject:?? Had that river and
its fertile banks been discovered before the establish-
ment at Sydney Cove had proceeded too far to remove
it, how eligible a place would it have been for the
principal settlement.? For in those days, so it is
recorded, ?the policy of the Government consisted
mainly in providing something to eat,? so frequently
did the demands of a large body of men and women
exceed the possibilities of supply in this new country
of ours. It was well, therefore, that some such pro-
lific district should have been put under cultivation,
and have its resources tested with so many excellent
results and so much tangible benefit to the colony
as a whole.
What a phenomenal growth there was during the
first one hundred years that followed the several
settlements along the Hawkesbury were first estab-

lislied! With all his unbounded faith in the future
of the land to which he sailed a stranger, and despite
the confidence he ever displayed as far as its pros-
pects were concerned, it is questionable whether
Captain Phillip, could he rise to-day from his not-
long-ago-diseovered grave at Bath, and look once again
upon the Great South Land of his waking and his
dreaming moments, with all its cities and its towns,
and its general air of solid progress and prosperity,
would not feel impelled for the moment to rub his
eyes so that he might make sure that he was really
wide awake. But it is all reality?a stem reality?
a reality tangible and lasting?due alone to the
enterprise and grit of that race of sturdy men and
women who brought with them the courageous charac-
teristics of the nation from which they sprung; that
mere handful of Britishers who pioneered this new
land of the South in the days of old, and thus laid
the foundation upon which our present day prosperity
has been so securely built.
In their respective day and generation the offspring
of many of the men and women (both bond and free)
who formed out earliest settlers have earned distinc-
tion in every walk of life ?as scholars they have very
conspicuously made their mark; in the fields of litera-
ture, law and commerce; in the political world as
well as in the realms of sport their names are legion.
At the seats of the mighty all the universe over, for
instance, the name of John Tebbutt, astronomer, is
one to conjure with; whilst Tompson and Harpur, the
first poets of the Hawkesbury, enjoy a prominence
essentially their own. All these worthy sons of
the earliest of Australian settlers owe much of
the prestige they have enjoyed to the exercise of
those beneficent gifts bestowed upon them by a
generous Providence; still, they had the thorny path
of learning smoothed for them by the men and women
who went before ?who blazed the track and levelled
the forest and built the houses and the towns; and
18
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


it is to these big-hearted, sturdy samples of healthy
manhood and tender womanhood that the fullest meed
of honest praise must needs be unstintingly awarded:
Hail to the veterans, true and tried!
The men of bygone years. j.
Could all the world put match beside
Our brave old pioneers?
The brooding forest, like the night,
Lay dark upon the lands;
But they had charms to break its might;
Their strong, soul-driven hands.
Their magic axes, keen and stout,
Lit many a dark recess,
And hewed a thousand homes from out
The leafy wilderness.
Soon, where the serried trees were shields
For tangled thorn and vine,
Far spread the rich full-blossomed fields? �
The grasses and the kine.
And where the forest spires alone
Shot from the soil untrod,
The temple bell?s inviting tone
Calls men to worship God.
For these, what guerdon now is best,
Who strove with stubborn Fates?
Lo, theirs shall be the seat of rest,
While rev?rence on them waits.

EARLY RECORDS FROM THE "SYDNEY
GAZETTE.?
THE first issue of the ?Sydney Gazette? bears date
March 5, 1803, and from my copy of the first year?s
file I take the following extracts, which will prove
of some interest to Hawkesbury folk:?
March 5, 1803. General Orders.?Repeated com-
plaints having been made of the great losses sustained
by the settlers of the Hawkesbury from the vexatious
conduct of the boatmen by whom they send their
grain to Sydney, the following regulations are to be
observed: Every person sending grain from the
Hawkesbury to Sydney in an open boat or a boat
that is not trustworthy, the magistrates are directed
to take no notice thereof. If on -proof it appears that
the master of a boat receives more grain than the
vessel ought to take with safety, the master shall
make good such quantity he may throw overboard
or otherwise damage, lose the freight of that part,
and, on conviction before two Magistrates, forfeit �5
to the Orphan Fund. If it shall appear to the Magis-
trates that grain coming round to Sydney has been
wetted, that it may weigh heavier or measure more
than the quantity put on board, the master shall on
conviction forfeit �5 to the Orphan Fund. The'
receiving granaries at Parramatta, and Hawkesbury,
being filled with wheat which is spoiling, no more
can be taken at those places until further orders,
except in payment for Government debts. Wheat will
continue to be received into the Stores at Sydney
until further orders. By command, W. N. Chapman,
Secretary, Government House.
(Apparently this was the original Australian wheat
pool, though nothing is said about a mice plague, or
Georgeson, or Talbot or Grahame. Neither is there
any complaint about excess dockage or difficulty in the
26


matter of procuring dunnage; nor is there mention of a
Government guarantee of 7s. 6d., or complaint that the
Government has not kept its promise to pay 2s. 6d. cash
per bushel on delivery.)
Sailed for the Hawkesbury, His Majesty?s armed
tender Lady Nelson: arrived from the Hawkesbury
with grain, the Raven, T. Raby, owner; sailed William
and Mary, J. Miller, owner.
Died, Cornwallis Farm, R. Withers, a settler of
the Hawkesbury, ?of an appoplexy. ?
March 19, 1803. Died last week in Sydney an
infant son of James Mileham, Surgeon,
March 26, 1803. Last week a woman was examined
before a magistrate at Hawkesbury on a charge of
carrying away from the barn of T. Grono a quantity
of wheat, his property.
April 2, 1803. On Sunday morning last T. Diggers
rode to town (Sydney) from Hawkesbury, a distance
of more than 40 miles within the space of three hours,
having left the former place at 7 o?clock and arrived
at Pitt?s Road rather before 10.
April 10, 1803. This being Easter Sunday, Divine
Service will be performed by the Rev. Mr. Marsden
(Rev. Samuel, who died years later at Windsor) at
St. John?s Church, Parramatta, for the first time.
April 17, 1803. Every person throughout the
Colony professing the Roman Catholic religion is to
attend Government House, Parramatta, on Wednes-
day, 20th April, at 10 o?clock in the forenoon, previous
to which those residing about Sydney are to give
their names, places of abode, &c., to the Rev. Mr.
Dixon, to the Magistrate?s Clerk at Parramatta, and
to Thomas Arndell, Esq., at Hawkesbury. By Com-
mand, U. N. Chapman, Secretary, Government House,
April 12, 1803.
April 24, 1803. General Orders: A settler at the
Hawkesbury having been promised an allotment of
land sometime past, which he sold soon after it was
measured, before the Grant was made out, which
27
EARLY RECORDS FROM 1 ? SYDNEY GAZETTE?


specifies that if the farm granted is sold before the
term of five years is expired such grant is null and
void?in consequence of which the Grant is cancelled.
To prevent such fraudulent practices in future, every
person about to purchase a farm will do well to inform
himself if there are any legal Title Deeds, otherwise
any loss and disappointment must fall on the seller
and buyer. By Command of His Excellency.
Regulations to be observed by the Rev. Mr. Dixon
and the Catholic congregations in this Colony: (1)
They will observe with all becoming gratitude, that
this extension of liberal toleration proceeds from the
piety and benevolence of our Most Gracious Sovereign,
to whom (as well as our Parent Country at large)
we are, under Divine Providence, indebted for the
blessings we enjoy. (2) That the religious exercise
of their worship may suffer no hindrance, it is ex-
pected that no seditious conversations that can any-
wise injure His Majesty?s Government or affect the
tranquility of this Colony will ever happen either
at the places prescribed for their worship or else-
where. But that they will individually manifest
their gratitude and allegiance by exerting themselves
in detecting and reporting any impropriety of that
or any other nature that may fall under their obser-
vation. (3) As Mr. Dixon will be allowed to perform
his clerical functions once in three weeks at the
settlements at Sydney, Parramatta and the Hawkes-
bury, in rotation, the magistrates are strictly for-
bidden suffering those Catholics who reside at the
places where service is not performing from resort-
ing to the settlement and district at which the priest
officiates for the day. (4) The Catholic service will
be performed on the appointed Sundays at 9 o?clock
in the morning. James Dixon.
Proclamation:?By His Excellency Philip Gidley
King, granting unto the Rev. Mr. Dixon a Conditional
Emancipation, to enable him to exercise his clerical
functions as a Roman Catholic Priest, which he has
28
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


qualified himself for by the regular and exemplary
conduct he has manifested since his residence in this
Colony, and his having taken the oaths of allegiance,
etc., prescribed by law.
May 8, 1803. On Wednesday, 27th nit., a Hawkes-
bury boat, belonging to Mr. Andrew Thompson, was
totally lost near Broken Bay, on the passage to
Sydney, with a full freightage of maize, potatoes and
melons.
A stranger has remarked that old English hospi-
tality expands itself throughout the Colony. In
Sydney, he says, he was entertained with ceremonious
politeness; in Parramatta with friendly affability;
and at the Hawkesbury as one of the family.
May 16, 1803. His Excellency having granted his
permission to H. Kable to run a Common Stage
Machine from Sydney to Parramatta and Hawkes-
bury, the undertaking will be accomplished about the
middle of July, and should the contest between Profit
and Loss determine in its favour, the plan will be
found to be of much public benefit and utility.
May 22, 1803, Died in the month of March at
Parramatta, in the 64th year of his age, Mr. James
Reid,, settler at Portland Head, and lately an officer
in one of His Majesty?s West Indian Regiments.
May 29, 1803. On Monday last a Criminal Court
assembled for the trial of Thomas Jamison, Esq.(!),
on the complaint of Mr. James Mileham for an
assault and battery on the 3rd May. Several wit-
nesses were called for the prosecution, Mr. Jamison
declining to set up any other plea than that of self-
defence. The Court were of opinion, from the evi-
dence, that Mr. Mileham struck Mr. Jamison first,
and consequently what followed was self-defence on
the part of Mr. Jamison. ?They therefore do acquit
him of the assault and battery laid to his charge, but
think it necessary to bind him over to keep the Peace
towards all His Majesty?s liege subjects, and par-
ticularly towards Mr. Janies Mileham, himself in �250
29
EARLY RECORDS FROM ?SYDNEY GAZETTE?


and two sureties in �125 each, for a term of three
years from this date.?
On Sunday last the sloop John, belonging to J.
Palmer, Esq. [Palmer, of Palmer?s grants fame] on
her passage from Hawkesbury with a cargo of 160
bushels of wheat, 60 bushels of maize, 2 tons of
potatoes and a number of very fine pumpkins, was
totally lost oil Broken Bay. Her hands got safely
ashore.
June 12, 1803. To be sold by private contract a
most commodious dwelling-house, with granaries for
wheat and corn, and barns, all weather-boarded and
shingled, with flock-houses and yard, well-watered and
free from floods; 60 acres of land of which 26 are
now sown in wheat and 7 in barley, all looking very
well, situate at Green Hills (Windsor). Likewise a
very valuable mare in foal, with a filly foal four
months old, a gelding rising three years, and a stallion
rising two years. The whole may be viewed upon
application to Thomas Rickerby [Rickerby?s Creek
is named after him] on the premises.
The Cato last week received on board 24 tons of
coal procured at the New Colliery at Hunter?s River
[the first coal discovered in Australia at ?Coal
Creek,? Newcastle] and brought round by the James
and Raven, belonging to Thomas Raby. The net sum
for which the entire freight sold w 7 as �63/11/-. [Raby
was husband of Mary Haydock, confused by many
with Margaret Catchpole.]
June ,26, 1803. General Orders; From the general
abundant crops of maize and the present thriving
state of swine and other stock, the Governor recom-
mends as ranch grain as can be spared from domestic
use to be appropriated to feeding swine, etc., which
must insure its increase. To enable the settlers to
save their breeding sows and increase the size of
their hogs, the quantity of salt meat received from
the Cape by the Bridgewater, will allow of a" certain
number of casks of salt beef being lent to such
3t)

settlers as may be approved of, on 1 condition of an
equal weight of fresh pork, exclusive of the head
and feet, being returned to the respective public stores
between the 5th June and the Ist August, 1804.
Applications for participation in this advantage by
settlers o?f the stores to be made at the Commissioner?s
Office, Sydney; to Mr. Williamson, at Parramatta;
and Mr. Baker at Hawkesbury. By command of His
Excellency.
Mr. J. Archer, of Hawkesbury, a settler, last week
lost a mare that died in consequence of a hurt, for
which he was a short time before offered 100 guineas.
Sale by auction: To be sold by Vendue at the House
of Andrew Thompson, Hawkesbury, on Wednesday,
6th July, and following days, a quantity of Irish
linens, Bandana handkerchiefs, calicoes, shoe and sole
leather, printed cottons, nankeens, leaf tobacco, salt,
and an assortment of ironmongery, &c., belonging to
the estate of Mr. Wm. Cox.
To be sold by auction by the Provost Marshal, by
virtue of an execution, on Monday next, 27 inst., 30
acs. of excellent land situate on the South Creek, at
Hawkesbury, and being part of a farm known by
the name of ?Farrell?s Farm.? Particulars known
by applying to Thos. Smyth, Provost Marshal.
To be sold on the premises at the Hawkesbury, the
effects and estate of the late John Castle, viz., a
20-acre farm, 10 acs. of wheat sowed and about 114
7 / ?I
of barley, a small stock of wheat, a quantity of maize
in cob, farming utensils, a steel mill, 3 blankets, a
small quantity of wearing apparel, about 30 fowls,
2 sows, 7 barrow slips and a quantity of potatoes
by the cwt. Six months? credit given on good
security.
July 3, 1803. We understand that His Excellency,
during his late visit to the out settlements has given
instructions for making a more convenient road to
Hawkesbury from Parramatta, by which the mischief
St
EARLY RECORDS FROM ? ? SYDNEY GAZETTE i ?


occasioned to horses and carriages from the necessity
of crossing the Seven Hills will be totally removed.
Ground has been measured at the Green Hills for
building a "school-house, 100 feet in length by 24 feet
wide, for the education of the youth on the banks
of the Hawkesbury, for which purpose the Govern-
ment has undertaken to make the bricks, and to give
such other assistance as may be admissible to effec-
tuate so desirable an institute in that quarter of the
Colony.
Whilst every reflecting person must view the exer-
tions now making by the settlers of the Hawkesbury
to forward the cultivation of their farms with that
satisfaction that a liberal mind ever feels in the
general welfare of a society, yet it is much to be
lamented that the settlers in that fertile quarter, as
well as in other parts of the Colony, have not turned
their attention more generally to procuring cattle
and ploughs than in persevering in the toilsome,
tedious and ruinous expense of the hoe. There are
now two influences which ought to serve as an en-
couragement to the industrious; the first is the Rev.
Mr. Marsden, who, if we mistake not, has ploughed
upwards of seventy acres this year ?-the second is Mr.
Palmer, who has very successfully ploughed three
hundred acres of his farm at Hawkesbury and sowed
it with wheat. When it is considered that the latter
employed nearly 300 men with the hoe, on a labour
that has been performed this year with less than
fifteen men, surely such great savings ought to induce
the settler to an endeavour at procuring their labour
by similar exertions.
Notice: William Baker, resident at Mr. Grimes?
farm at Hawkesbury, feels it incumbent on him to
request that persons who may have business to
transact on or about the said premises will not
exceed nine o?clock at night, until which hour his
dogs (which have been complained of as troublesome)
will be kept secured. He further acquaints persons

whose concerns may lead them that way that he has
lately turned his road.
A new Road has lately been marked out from
Richmond Hill to Prospect, by which a distance of
ten miles will be saved in making the journey.
July 17, 1803. Any person having a claim or
demand on the estate and effects of the late Robert
Wethers of the Hawkesbury (who died intestate) are
requested to give a statement to the Judge Advocate?s
Office within one month from the date hereof.
The farm and effects of the late John Castle, sold
by auction at Hawkesbury on 5th inst. and the prices

maize, per bushel, 3/11, later 3/11; potatoes, per
cwt., 11/6; a small stack of wheat, �B/10/-; the
farm and standing crop, �l7O. ?D. Dunslow, pur-
chaser. The above sales w r ere made on condition of
six months? credit, the same to be paid in wheat at
the Hawkesbury.
The Sophie Mary left Hawkesbury on the 14th and
was lost?she was the property of T. Dargon.

directs
September 18, 1803. To be sold by auction by S.
Lord, on Monday, 26th September, on Lieut. Hobby's
Farm at Hawkesbury, a herd of Goats in number
about 200, and which, for the convenience of Pur-
chasers, will be put up in small lots. Persons pur-

Tracey, and Brien O?Brien indicted for felony com-
mitted in the house of Samuel Philps at Hawkesbury

tenced to death and Brien discharged without a stain
on his character. [Of the above, the death sentence
in the cases of John Pearson and McLaughlane, Junr.,
were altered to imprisonment for life.]
A strong, well-built sloop, from 35 to 40 tons
burden, belonging to Mr. Andrew Thompson, was on
Saturday, 17th inst., launched at the Green Hills,

nearly the same size now on the stock, which will
be nearly ready to launch.

Advertisement: Complaints having been made by
subscribers resident in some parts of the District of
Hawkesbury of disappointment in receiving their
papers in the proper time, we beg leave to inform
our readers in that vicinity that they are now
addressed to the care of Mr. Andrew Thompson, to
be left at the Bridge House, Hawkesbury [the Bridge
House on the left side of the South Creek Bridge,
going McGrath Hill-wards], Mr. Thompson having-
made a voluntary tender of his good offices in that
delivery. In future, both to save trouble to the
person deputed to publish the papers at the Bridge
House and disappointment to our readers, the name
of each subscriber shall be written on his paper, which
will be given to such persons only as may be properly
authorised to receive them.
October 9, 1803. General Orders: From the im-
provident method taken by the First Settlers on the
sides of the Hawkesbury and Creeks in cutting down
timber and cultivating the banks, many acres of
ground have been removed, lands inundated, houses,
stacks of wheat and stock washed away by former
floods, which might have been prevented in some
measure if the trees and other native plants had been
suffered to remain: and instead of cutting any down
to have planted others to bind the soil of the banks
closer, and rendered them less liable to be carried
away by every inconsiderable flood. Nor is this the
only evil: The public convenience having suffered bv
the numerous large trees lying in this stream and
fallen across, rendering water carriage on the Creek
almost impracticable, and in some part of the Hawkes-
bury very dangerous. As several settlers have been
and are now fencing on the lower part of the Hawkes-
bury, along the Nepean, South Creek, and George?s
River, in situations where the above evils may be
prevented, it is herebly directed that no Settler or
other person to whom ground is granted or leased
on the sides of any river or creek where timber is
35
EARLY RECORDS FROM ?SYDNEY GAZETTE?


now growing do on any account cut down or destroy
by barking or otherwise any tree or shrub growing
within two rods of the edge of the bank, except for
an opening, one rod wide, to have access to water.
Mr. Evans, Acting Surveyor of Lands, is directed to
communicate this Ordinance to those lately settled,
and give the Governor a list of those who have not
vet cut any timber down in the above situations,
that it may be made a condition in their grant, and
should they not be sufficiently sensible of the general
and individual benefit arising from this necessary
regulation, the Magistrates are hereby required to
levy a fine of fifty shillings for each tree cut down,
the penalty to go to the informer prosecuting to
conviction before two Magistrates. Within the two
rods of timber left on the banks another rod is to
be left for a Public Road along the sides of the River
or Creek, which three rods are not in future to be
measured in the respective allotments. It is earnestly
recommended to those who already hold farms by
grant, situated on the side of any river or creek
liable to floods, and which have been cleared of timber,
to replant the banks with such binding plants and
trees as they can procure. By Command of His
Excellency, W. N. Chapman, Sec., Government House,
Oct. 4, 1803.
October 9, 1803. Execution: Last Friday fort-
night, Thomas McLaughlane was? removed from
Parramatta to the Hawkesbury, there to suffer the
sentence of the law; and about five in the afternoon
was lodged in a place of security near the New Store,
and there attended by the Rev. Mr. Dixon, Minister
of the Church of Rome. At nine on Saturday morn-
ing the then unhappy criminal was taken from his
last confinement to the place of execution at the
Green Hills, near the back of the Old Store. In his
latter moments he conducted himself with decency
of his confinement; to the Minister he attended with
fervour and observed a profound silence. At 10 he


was given up to the executioner, and in a few moments
after atoned for his offences. This is the third who
has suffered of the eight cast for death, the rest being
pardoned on condition of remaining Transports for
Life. May that Mercy be productive of the desired
good effect.
The new Hawkesbury sloop, built at the Green
Hills, Mr. A. Thompson, owner, came round for the
first time on Monday last with 1,160 bushels of wheat
on from Cornwallis Farms, cultivated by the Govern-
ment, and could have taken in with safety 250 more.
This vessel, called the Nancy, was built under the
sole management and direction of Mr. Kelly, Chief
Mate, formerly of the Eliza whaler, who also navigates
her. Her computed burthen is 40 tons, carries five
men, and has four swivels mounted on her quarter
railing. Connoisseurs find no other fault with her,
than on account of her being ?rather shallow in the
bow.? A turkey once presumed to censure the legs
of a Peacock!
November 6, 1803. Last Monday the Hope, Small-
wood, coming round from Hawkesbury, freighted
with grain, sunk near the North Head, but the hands,

EARLY RECORDS FROM {i SYDNEY GAZETTE ?


CENTENARY OF WINDSOR.
THE celebration of Windsor?s Centenary took place
on the Hawkesbury Racecourse, during December,
1910, when natives of the Old Hawkesbury came
along from near and far. The speech of the day was
made by Mr. Joseph Cook, who, proposing ?The Day
w r e Celebrate,? expressed his indebtedness to Mr. J.
C. L. Fitzpatrick and warmly congratulated him on
his book entitled ?The Good Old Days.? Mr. Cook
proceeded to ask the question: What did" The Day
we Celebrate? mean? Did it mean the highty flow-
ing river of our present day civilisation, or that trickle
or rill which was but barely traceable a century ago?
Did it mean the noonday and the refulgent glory
of the present, or the mist and twilight of its dawn
in the days of long ago? He thought it included
both. If they measured the present by the past the
contrast would be great indeed, and yet if they looked
closely they would find that though the externals of
progress and civilisation had changed?though, may
be, they had changed their colour and shape and form,
they would find that the inside had changed, perhaps
less than they thought. What he meant was that
in the days of long ago there was the same human
nature expressing itself in its infinite and varied
forms just as they saw it to-day. Then, as now, men
sought to realise their life and destiny through many
and varied exercises of that mental heritage which
was our God-given birthright. And just as they
differed in their qualities, so did the expression of
their life shape itself. Not only did they fight nature
?with the blacks by day and with the kangaroos by
night?but they also fought as strenuously as now
on the fields of sport. He had been looking over
the roll of honour on the wall behind him. He noticed
40


that amongst all the splendid horses which the district
had produced ?Jorrocks? was singled out for the
supreme place. Perhaps this was right. He read,
however, that Killarney was eventually the master
of old Jorrocks. So perhaps they might go together.
Then he noticed on the cricket roll the name of their
old and good friend, W. Howell. But while they
rightly honoured his prowess on the field in these
modern days, they must not forget George Freeman?s
six wickets for seven runs. He (Mr. Cook) had seen
Howell do the hat trick, but he did not know if he
could beat George Freeman?s record. Then, if their
old friend, Dan Mayne, were still here he could speak
of the cock-pit of ?ye olden time,? a thing they
had now left behind them. He also noted that in the
boxing of the olden days the place of honour was
given to Norris. From his reading, however, he was
not sure if Teale was not equally entitled. Then, if
they came to political fighting it would be found that
and propriety, as he had done during the whole term
this was in every way as vigorous, as picturesque,
as interesting, as the fights of to-day. In this respect
they remembered such gladiators as Messrs. Fitzgerald,
Bowman, McQuade, and their late good old friend
Mr. William Walker. Wherever they looked they
found the civilisation of ?the long ago? as varied,
as vivid, as agitated, and sometimes as confused as
now. Perhaps they might best measure their progress
by reference to those attributes of civilisation which
had to do with justice and liberty. They might re-
member how the woman, Batkins, was sold by her
unworthy husband in the street for �l6 and some
cloth, and how the unfortunate woman went gladly
to her purchaser, believing that he would make a
better husband than her former one. This kind of
thing was now and again done even in our day,
though no longer, he was glad to say, in the Empire.
Then there were banks and burglars just as now,
and they knew how to charge interest, too, in those
41
CENTENARY OF WINDSOR


days. They read of �2/10/- being paid as interest
on a loan of �5. Let them think of the poor convict,
who, for running away, received 150 lashes; and of
the unfortunate who for stealing a keg of rum paid
the forfeit of his life; or again of the boy Bennett,
a 17-year-old youth, for breaking and robbing
a tent, was executed. All these incidents shocked
them as they read and pondered the record. He, how-
ever, wanted them to remember that such a criminal
code was not peculiar to Australia at that time, but
w T as the penal code of England. They were too apt
to think that these happenings were due to some
entirely unprecedented and abnormal administration.
It was, however, simply the full and effective, if
sometimes harsh, administration of the laws of the
realm. They were told, for instance, by Blackstone
that in the reign of George 111 there were no fewer
than one hundred and sixty offences which were
punishable with death. They heard of the splendid
thirst of the men in those days, and it is recorded
that one man sold his 100 acres of land for �2O to
a publican, and did not leave the pub until the whole
of it had gone. (Laughter.) But what occurred at
that time elsewhere? Macaulay told them that ?It
was a favourite amusement of dissolute young gentle-
men to swagger by night about the town (London)
breaking windows, upsetting sedans, beating quiet
men, and offering rude caresses to pretty w r oraen.?
He further speaks of the ?Mohawks,? those ?sons
of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.? These
things prove that if such manners and habits pre-
vailed now the old laws would be still in force. Let
them remember his point, which was, that though
the externals of their civilisation had greatly changed,
their internal human nature had changed but little.
They might also look at the other side of the picture.
Let them think of and hold in honour the bravery
of the men in their fight with wild nature; of their
efforts to construct and multiply the facilities for
42
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


intercourse, such as roads and bridges. He had
travelled from Parramatta that morning in three-
quarters of an hour. Once upon a time it took 21
days to get from Parramatta to Windsor. It is true
16 days of this was spent at Magrath?s Hill.
(Laughter.) No, he did not mean internal irriga-
tion, but that which even now sometimes caused them
trouble?he meant a mighty flood. But when this
was subtracted from the total it left five days for
the journey. Then again, only the other day in
Sydney one of the members of the Art Society had
soundly rated the members because he said they were
doing nothing but painting in oils nowadays. It
reminded him of the time when the residents had
to send to England to get (Governor Macquarie?s
portrait painted in oils as a memorial of the success
and justice of his tenure of office. The fact was some
of these early pioneers builded better than they knew.
In the scantiness and deprivation of their own liberty
which they suffered, some of them watered and
fructified the soil on which their liberty to-day grew
so luxuriantly, that it almost tended to run to license.
In building these bridges and roads they ministered
to their own daily necessities and wants, all uncon-
scious of the fact that they w r ere at the same time
providing facilities for the dissemination of know-
ledge and influence over all Australia. They little
dreamt in their hard lot that around them were
thousands of millions of latent wealth in the sheep
pastures of the continent, and many more hundreds
of millions in the mineralised grounds of Australia.
Nor should we forget amid these more material con-
siderations the efforts of the good and brave and
self-sacrificing men who held aloft the torch of truth
and carried the banner of freedom. They did their
best amid untoward surroundings to impress the
altruistic and spiritual ideals upon the life and
movements of their days. The evidence of this was
to be found in the old sacred edifices which still stand
43
CENTENARY OF WINDSOR


to bear witness of the truth of things. We might
at a time like this well ask ourselves what had the
century brought us? The answer was?better social
relations. A justice that can neither be bought nor
sold ?a justice also penetrated with wisdom, intelli-
gence and sympathy, as becomes the spirit of the
twentieth century. A justice that in its exercise
amongst the unfortunate is oft-times linked with the
quality of mercy. It had also brought them a kind-
ness and humanity which expressed itself in hospitals
for the sick, in pensions for the poor, in better con-
ditions of employment for the men ?indeed for all.
It had brought them also an increase and diffusion
of knowledge and in the facilities for cultivating the
spirit and training the mind of the nation. To this
our public and private, our primary and secondary
schools, bore witness; and last though not least the
great agricultural college on the old common yonder.
It was a most fitting thing that here in the birthplace
of the agricultural and industrial enterprises of the
people, there should be founded the best school of
its kind in all Australia. Long may it prosper and lay
in the future the basis of a healthy and numerous yeo-
manry, which was the only enduring guarantee of
the nation?s future prosperity. And what of that
future? They were to-day measuring the range and
scale of their advances during the past hundred
years. Bright as that page of progress was, the next
hundred would eclipse it. With ?freedom
slowly broadening down from precedent to prece-
dent,? and with the economic ideals of the nation
tinctured and influenced by the altruistic spirit which
was abroad, they need have no fear to step out into
the next century of national existence. They believed
in their race and hoped to preserve this continent as
the home of a great white people, who in all the
time to come would hold this outpost for the Empire
and for the good of humanity at large.
44
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


WHEN WE WERE BOYS TOGETHER.
In vain! There never grew a grape
On Greek or Lusitanian shore
Whose juice could help us to escape
The thoughts of days that are no more.
?Victor Daley.
SOME years ago I called upon a somewhat treacherous
memory to furnish me with flashlight photographs of
residents of the Windsor and Richmond districts of
30 years earlier?for such facts and incidents relating
to their every-day life, calling, eccentricities, and
what-not, as were likely to prove interesting?and
the result, after all, was not altogether disappointing.
I had pleasure in looking upon their faces once again,
even though it were but in fancy, whilst readers of
the notes perhaps secured some little enjoyment from
a casual contemplation of the records of the past.
A character in a modern work of fiction (entitled
?The King?s Blue Ribband?) was credited by the
author with this remark: ?There?s a rare virtue,
Madam, in giving the Past the Go-by, and painting
the Future in the rainbow rues of Hope ? ? ?but surely
no greater counterfeit sentiment was ever minted
in the gold-strewn vaults of reason. We have justi-
fication for being proud of our Past, for, as one of
our first and most appreciated poets put it:
We have no record of a by-gone shame, ,
No red-writ histories of woe to weep;
God set our land in summer seas asleep
Till His bright morning for her waking came.
And as far as the Hawkesbury is concerned, even
though in the earlier stages of its colonisation and
settlement it went through many rough experiences,
45


it still had amongst its population the best of good
stock, and its native-born men and women would
stand test against the captious critics of to-day in
whatever department of activity they might be called
upon to display their prowess.
But enough of the introductory element ?my object
here is to make brief reference to several local nota-
bilities who, though entitled to some sort of passing
recognition, managed to avoid, for the time being,
contact with the mental camera; and to others who
have gone hence in the interval.
Take that most picturesque old figure, known to
Richmondites, young and old, of the time, Constable
(or was it Senior Constable?) Tom sur-
name generally corrupted locally till it became
Tierney. He lived somewhere over in one of the
back streets, in a pretty cottage, and he had a daughter
whose Christian name I just now forget, though a
quaint suspicion afflicts me that it was Maggie. Any-
how, Tom Tiernan was a prominent figure upon the
local landscape. He frequently visited Windsor, the
police headquarters, riding a black charger, which, of
necessity, had to be somewhat of a weight-carrier,
inasmuch as Tiernan was a man of much weight. He
died in the old town long years ago.
Then there was the late Rowland Hill Ducker, who
was in business in Richmond for a very considerable
period, and was a pillar of the Methodist Church.
He married a daughter of the late Enoch Fowler,
who started making pottery in Parramatta Street,
Sydney, about 1839, and one of whose sons, ?Bob?
Fowler, was M.P. for Camperdown for a number of
years.
Then there was good old George Match am Pitt, of
"Sunnyside," whose house was one of the ? ? open
door? type. Who that ever visited it but can recollect
the generous table, groaning under a weight of good
things, and every chair down its long length fully
occupied, morning, noon, and night. One met under
46
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


this hospitable roof the best Australian and visiting
artists?Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, A. H. Full-
wood, and others of that ilk. Everybody who was
anybody, and who ventured Richmondwards, was
welcome at ?Sunnyside,? and sure of a good time.
The name of Pitt has been a household word ever
since the earliest days of Australian colonisation,
and not the least worthy representative of an honoured
family was the late G.M.P. As for Mrs. Pitt, who
predeceased him, she had a great fund of the milk
of human kindness in her composition, and the district
as a whole was the poorer by a long way when she
went hence.
Obituary announcements call to mind two one-time
popular business men of Windsor?Mr. Frank Howard
and Mr. Peter Fraser. The former was an ironmonger
by occupation, employed by the late Mr. William
Beard, who at that time did his trade in a squat
little building on the site of the present two-storied
structure. Mr. Howard became a partner in the
business. He was a genial personage, and enjoyed
his joke and his pipe. He weighed out pounds of
nails and sold ploughs and gears, and the thousand-
and-one requisites of the householder and the farmer,
to the accompaniment of honest laughter. One saw
him wending his way to the George Street shop at
7 a.m., and met him again leaving that establishment
at 9 or 10 p.m.?for there were no limitations put
upon the hours of employment in those far-off times;
and he never seemed out of humour with the world
at large. One of his sons was Mr. Alf. Howard, and
a daughter married one Gillies, of the Prisons Depart-
ment.
Almost his next door neighbour was Peter Fraser.
He was a watchmaker, etc., in the employ of Cooper
Broderick, and my first recollection of him was when
the shop, with its clocks of all sorts of shapes, sizes,
and classes of ?tick,? was situate in a little one-
47
WHEN WE WERE BOYS TOGETHER


storied terrace on the site of the existing Commercial
Bank. One section of the premises was the residence
and drapery store of Mr. Patrick Butler, another
was Cooper Broderick?s, but I forget who tenanted
the balance. Anyhow, the watchmaker?s shop was
always well patronised at night by the men gossips
of the town, and whilst Peter Fraser discussed what-
ever was doing for the edification of all and sundry,
Cooper Broderick, a stout and sturdy Englishman
of the best old stock, smoked his pipe, and ventured
a word of two by way of punctuation or elaboration.
Richard Ridge, John Michael McQuade, the William
Dean of the day, John and Alexander Neilson, Jim
Holmes, and the Walkers (Bob and Matt), as well
as Senior Sergeant J. J. Fitzpatrick, and a host of
others, looked in and added a word or two to the
discussion. He was a kindly hearted citizen, the
same Peter Fraser, and for years he played his part
at St. Matthew?s Church of England, when the Rev.
C. F. Garnsey was incumbent. His death, in 1920
or thereabouts, was not unexpected, and it came as
a sort of relief after years of patient suffering; never-
theless, the circle of former friends who will regret
Mr. Fraser?s removal from their midst is very, very
large, indeed.
On the Richmond Road in the 70?s and 80?s were
quite a number of training stables, conducted by the
Dargins, Joe Cook, and other experts whose names
will not just now answer the call. Joe Cook is still
in the flesh, and can tell many interesting stories
of his experiences on and off the Hawkesbury race-
course. James Huxley kept one of the hotels on the
road, and another was presided over by Mrs. Mark-
well, and some of the best-known jockeys of the time
were in residence there, including the then popular
Brickey Colley. The Kirwan family grew up in this
region, whilst not far distant were the homes of the
Hoskissons, the Dights, the Barkers, Shepherds,
48
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


Roberts, Bowmans, and others too numerous to
mention.
Out ?beyant,? at Hobartville, amongst the oaks,
Mr. Andrew Town, the Uncrowned King, held sway.
Of him, as a breeder of famous horses, blood and
draught; as farmer on a large scale, and as adviser-
in-chief and banker to a large clientele, much has
been written in the past. He was a man of generous
proportions, and his heart w T as in the right place, and
as big as his frame. Later on he paid the penalty,
as many good men do, and when the crash came
many of his former friends, and many w T ho had eaten
of his salt and enjoyed his bounty, freely reviled him,
quite forgetful of the good features which had marked
his long and useful public and private career.
Richmond in those days was the home of many
good old types of the Hawkesbury native ?the Onus
brothers, Joseph being Mayor of the town for a
number of years; John and William Lamrock, both
splendid men, who had views of their own and the
courage to express them; Mr. G. Guest, senr., and
his son Charles, for many years secretary t6 the
Hawkesbury Race Club and the District Agricultural
Association; Alex. Benson, W. Durham, Prosper H.
Ridge, Frank Gow (for many years a member of the
firm of John Bridge and Co. ?he married a daughter
of the late Mr. Thomas Pyrke, another Richmondite,
well and favourably known to a large circle of
friends); W. Reid, who kept the Royal Hotel; Mr.
and Mrs. William Sly (of the Black Horse), William
Mitchell, George Cobcroft, Harry Stevenson, of North
Richmond, and Jack Town and Jack Smith of the
same place; Alfred Smith, who had a long and varied
career, during the course of which he travelled cattle
north and west over beaten and unbeaten tracks till
he knew the whole countryside like a book; Matthew
Nowland and Christopher May, of Pitt Town Bottoms,
and Michael Waters, of Richmond Bottoms, three
49
WHEN WE WERE BOYS TOGETHER


familiar figures in Windsor at least once a week; the
Davenports and Slatterys, Bathers, Barlows, and
heaven knows how many others, all good citizens,
most of them with a long string of descendants who
worthily follow in the footsteps of their parents.
One local functionary who deserves special mention
was Robert Tilling. He was the bailif and pound-
keeper at Richmond for years; and who doesn?t
recollect him, as he jogged his way through Windsor
on a bob-tailed nag, with the reins hanging loosely
over his left arm (from which the hand was missing),
whilst he brushed the dies away from his face with
a handkerchief or a bough from one of the bush trees.
Then there were the Forresters ?William, from
Liverpool, and William who once had stations in the
West?both of them are dead. They were locally
known as ?Black Bill? and ?Red Bill? respectively.
In the heyday of their careers, both were wealthy,
but something happened, and they fell from their
high estate. Bob Forrester, from Kurrajong, was of
the family?a good sport and a well-read man. And
Chaffie Roberts, the butcher, must not be forgotten.
He was a host in himself, and could entertain a crowd
as well as most men of his time.
Back to Windsor again, and we are brought into
touch with William Commins, who reached the old
Hawkesbury town in the 70?s, and perhaps one of
the first jobs he and his partner, Mr. L. Pickup, did
was the renovation of the police barracks. They had
in their employ a labourer, whose name I forget. He
was a burly, fresh-complexioned man, jolly and good-
natured, and he died suddenly from an attack of
cholera, or some such complaint. Down in George
Street, near where Collison the undertaker lived, was
the shop of a painter named Louis Lind. lie was a real
artist, and an entertainer of high repute ?a French-
man, who made many friends in Windsor and there-
abouts. Up in the terrace of cottages close by where
50
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


Mr. and Mrs. D. Holland, senr., lived (Catherine
Street), the Bannister family resided. They have
long since shaken Windsor?s dust off their feet, going
Sydneywards. Not far away resided Mr. John Perry
(then an employee at Busby?s tannery). He took
an interest in racing, and owned a very slippery little
pony which ran at the Boxing Day meeting in the
Long Lane. Later he secured a position in the railway
service, and later still was proprietor of Marsden?s
Hotel at Liverpool.
The Cambridge family is almost as old as Windsor
itself, and the present postman is the third generation
of postmen of the name in the old town ?and let?s
hope there are more to follow. No more highly-
regarded resident was to be found than Mrs. Cam-
bridge, senr., of the Peninsula, and none could more
richly deserve such regard than this kind-hearted
gentle, old lady, with her years thick upon her.
Just a few more familiar names, and then for a
' halt: The Cronos from riverwards; Bill Jones, of
Colo, and his neighbour of many years, Billy Moran;
then there was Bob Bales, whose deafness was a pain-
ful affliction; Mrs. Lowe, one of the grand old ladies
of the river, and mother of Councillor Bob Lowe;
long Tom Rose, of Webb?s Creek; Ned and Alf.
Robinson, of Freeman?s Reach and Wilberforce
respectively ; at the Reach Ned had a monkey in
? captivity, and the animal was saved with difficulty
on the occasion of one of the floods about the 70?s;
Henry Wilson, of ?Riversvale,? Wiseman?s Ferry,
and James Walmsley, senr., who kept the hotel at the
Ferry, and of which his son James later became land-
lord; William and John Owens, Roger Ryan, and
Mr. Mahony, father of the John Mahony of to-day?
all of Pitt Town; Mr. Mawson, the Pitt Town Boni-
face, and Hobbs, the local postmaster, as good a sort
as one could meet in a week?s walk; Harry Curl, who
passed in his checks years ago?father of the pro-
51
WHEN WE WERE BOYS TOGETHER


prietor of the Royal Hotel, Windsor ?a straight-goer,
who rode his horse like a dragoon and who had seen
much of the world outside Pitt Town. We must not
forget little King George, of Pitt Town, who came
from down the river. He was very short of stature,
stout, and had a family of sons and daughters built
like unto himeslf. His advent to each year just about
Christmas-tide was the signal for an outburst of en-
thusiasm on the part of the boyhood of forty years
agone. There w r as also Joe Jacklin, from Maroota,
a quaint little chap. Then there was Mrs. Slater, of
the Brickfields, Windsor, whose life was rendered
miserable and scarce worth the living by the youth
of the self-same period, w T ho hailed her with cries
of ?Beelzebub,? and then took cover round street
corners whilst the old lady stood for a moment or
two and let loose the vials of her wrath. Also Mary
Green, whose mansion was situate in the same aristo-
cratic locality. She had a family of both sexes, who
became scattered far and wide as the years rolled on.
And who doesn?t remember the Tuckermans, par-
ticularly Prosper, who contributed to the local press
and played cricket; also Mrs. Davis, who ran a
passenger vehicle to Sackville Reach for many years.
Likewise old Peter de Rome, of Stannix Park, and
the Teale, Dunston, Bushell, Bowd, and Cobcroft
families, of Wilberforce. Since writing the above
several other names have cropped up. There was a
Mr. Cadell connected in some way with business in
Windsor in the 70?s. Can?t altogether fix him, but
recollect that the old brewery, just below ?Sunny
Brae,? was known as Cadell?s Brewery. It consisted
of a nest of solid brick buildings filled with rusty
boilers and machinery, and the structures were pulled
to pieces over twenty years ago. It would be interest-
ing to learn when they were erected, names of builders,
by whom conducted, and how they came ultimately
to be abandoned. Perhaps someone who knows will
52
THOSE WEEE THE DAYS


furnish the necessary information. There was also
a family named Cadden, resident in Macquarie Street,
all of whom have since disappeared. The last of them
lived in a cottage somewhere close to Mr. L, Pickup?s.
News of the retirement from business of Mr. George
Marden calls to mind the fact that his father was a
highly respected resident of Old Windsor; and George
himself is a worthy son of a worthy sire. His good
wife was of a gentle and kindly disposition, and the
loss the family have sustained is irreparable. Mr.
Marden is a living exemplification, if one were needed,
of the truth of the old adage that ?God helps them
who help themselves.? He is not one of the type
who sit down and wait for someone to come along
and put food into their mouths and money in their
pockets. He struck out for himself, and without the
aid of that grandmotherly legislation, which is most
surely sapping the people?s independence, he so made
his way in the world that to-day he is able to take
ease beneath his own fig-tree. May he live long to
enjoy his well-earned leisure.
SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE.
[Written by Himself ?1906.]
I WAS born in George Street, Windsor, on Bth July,
1829, and am, therefore, in my 78th year. Out of
that long life 33 years were spent at Bathurst and
Forbes ?principally the former, where, in company
with Jip Ford, a racing man, I started the TattersalFs
Hotel.
During the excitement of the gold-fever and the
period when the bushrangers held the West in awe,
I had opportunities of coming into contact with many
celebrities, of whom I can tell when we get properly
going.
My newspaper, The Bathurst Sentinel\ also brought
me into touch with some smart literary men. Among
53
SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE


those who wrote for me were Hunt (?The Flaneur?),
A. G. Taylor, Harold Grey (?The Pilgrim?),
Montague (once editor and proprietor of Punch),
Tom Naylor, and Dick Thatcher.
My parents were Irish ?both born in the Province of
Connaught. At the time of my birth?so lam told ?
they resided in a little weatherboard cottage ?one
of a row which graced the main thoroughfare in those
early days?opposite where Mr. J. O'Brien kept a
shop until recently, and next door to Paddy Doyle?s
?Rose Inn,? long-since closed up.
Often I have heard old hands of the previous
generation speak of an amusing incident in connection
iwith my birth, which important event happened at
about 2 o?clock in the morning. It appears there was
an hotel a little way up from our home, kept by one
of the earlier generations of the Dargins; and the
bar boy?s name was Jimmie Brady. Brady, who is
now no more, occupied an upstair room somewhere
at the back; and those who were ?in the know,? and
happened to want a drink long after hours, when
?the house was all asleep,? could always bring down
Brady by rattling a long pole, the end of which ran
up into his room. And so, one morning, shortly after
two, my Dad (James Mayne), who liked a glass now
and then, and invariably celebrated any special occa-
sion, prodded up Brady. Mrs. Mayne had just given
birth to a boy, and he called to drink its health.
Half an hour afterwards he returned to wake Brady
up again. A second boy had been born. And a little
later on there was another call. Brady was asked
to ?fill ?em up again,? but he could hardly credit
the statement that there were three babies. This
was considered but a joke. Nevertheless, it proved a
true bill. Yes, yours truly was one of the three. And
lam told the military men ?I forget which regiment
was quartered in Windsor at the time ?afterwards
came down in dozens, bringing all sorts of presents.

THOSE WERE THE HAYS


Unfortunately two of the triplets died within a fort-
night.
The population of Windsor in those days was much
larger than now; and it was a much busier place.
At my earliest recollection the hotels alone numbered
about twenty-seven. It was, indeed, a great place
for pubs. In a short thoroughfare like Fitzgerald
Street there were no less than three. It was known
as ?Hangman?s Row.? There were also several pubs
in Macquarie Street ?now there are none in the by-
streets, and only six in the whole town.
In those days several boats came to Windsor loaded
with material, for building purposes.
There were a lot of business people here. It was
like a little city. Night auction sales used to be held.
A Mr. Thompson was one of the auctioneers. He was
father to the Tommie Thompson, who for many years
had the mail contract between Windsor and Wiseman?s
Ferry, and claimed to be the oldest mailman in the
State, and to have been carrying longer than any other
man.
The grandest wheat in Australia was grown here,
up till the time the rust came. There were two mills
in Windsor and one at Wilberforce, w T hile there was
also a watermill at Richmond.
The road to Sydney was alive with teams. On
market days we would hear them rumbling through
Windsor at 1 o?clock in the morning. The teamsters
would take down wheat, hay and corn, poultry and
eggs, and return laden with goods for the storekeepers.
On the road there was a pub every three or four miles.
Where the Fitzroy bridge, Windsor, now spans
South Creek, was a wooden bridge and a toll bar.
The tollkeeper?s house is there yet. There Avas a punt
service at Windsor and Richmond, and boats to take
passengers.
The first school I went to was kept by a man named
Cassidy, down the lane by Miss Bushell?s, in a place
55
SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE


called Creely?s mills. Of course, there were only the
denominational schools then. It is needless to explain
which wastmine. The name of the teacher is enough!
Tom Maloney, who died a short time ago, was a school
mate. Billy Linsley (the late Major Linsley) was
another. There were also Johnny and Billy Kilduff,
and the late James Cunneen, who became Postmaster-
General. Joe Teale, w r ho turned out the great fighting
man, and Mick Flood were also among those I can
remember, but the only one still living is Tom Collison,
of Windsor.
A lot of the Protestant boys went to Cassidy's. For
a while I also went to the Church of England school,
which was near the School of Arts, and was last kept
by Mr, W. Bailey; the building has lately been
demolished to make room for the residence of Senior-
Sergeant Boyd. The first teacher there was a Mr.
Quaife, and among the scholars I recall John Tebbutt
and Henry Moses ?the astronomer and the M.L.C.
respectively.
This was a great place for races, held once a year.
I cannot remember the meetings at Killarney.
Dargin?s course was the earliest I recall. I used to
go there a lot with Charlie Smith, a Sydney butcher,
who had a great breeding and training place at Clifton,
where Mr. Sam Hoskisson now lives. I remember
Smith?s celebrated mare, Beeswing, getting killed.
The late Johnny Higgerson rode for him. Jimmie
Holmes, with whom I have been chums since boy-
hood, used to ride for George Hall. Micky 0 Brien
father of Jack and Bill O?Brien?was a great horse-
man. Of all the jockeys of those days I liked him
the best. He had splendid hands, was cool and daring,
and rode with great judgment. And James Dargin,
I remember him riding a celebrated mare called
Cassandra.
Jimmie Holmes often comes to see me. We had
a long chat the other day, and together put down
56
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


the names of the jockeys we used to know; but I
have lost the list. Very few ,of the boys of those
days are now left. Reminds me of Adam Lindsay
Gordon?s lines ?
Aye! nearly all our comrades of the old colonial school,
Our ancient boon companions, Jim, are gone;
Hard livers for the most part, somewhat reckless as a rule,
It seems that you and I are left alone.
[Since the above was written, both Dan and his
friend, Mr. James Holmes, have passed over to the
great majority.]
MORE OF DAN MAYNE?S REMINISCENCES.
I REMEMBER, when I was only a little fellow, the
two Freemans?George (called ?Clear the Kitchen?)
and Thomas, kept hotels. George also had a tine farm
at Cornwallis, now occupied hy the Gows, just below;
old St. Matthew?s. The cricket dinners were mostly]
got up by George, whose hotel ?a three-storey one,
long since pulled down ?was close to where Miss
Dick?s residence is now. ?The Cricketers? Arms?
was the name of the pub.
In those days the cricketers used to play for �1
a bat ?�11 aside. ?Home and home? was the method
?Parramatta would come here, then Windsor would
go to Parramatta, and so on. A dinner for twenty-
six, including the umpires and scorers, would be worth
catering for?�26 !
It was at the old ?Cricketers? Arms? that I learned
the art of dancing, from a Mr. William Clarke, who
hired an assembly room there, and also visited Rich-
mond. He had a brother John in the same line in
Sydney. They were fine fellows. It was while con-
ducting these assemblies that William Clarke met his
wife, a nice, clever young lady living with the Free-
mans, who adopted her on the death of her parents
when she was very young.
The two Freemans were bitter enemies, and strove
57
SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE


to outvie each other. Whatever one had the other
would get. Each had a blind fiddler.
Thomas Freeman?s hotel was just about where Mr.
Swords? saddlery shop is now, and his fiddler was a
red-headed chap.
Music was allowed in the hotel bars then, and
dancing and singing. Not the dancing such as Mr.
Clarke taught, but hornpipes and four-handed reels,
especially the former. Tommie Burns and Blind
Loftus were great at it, and were in demand by the
publicans. Then there was Davie the barber.
Blind Tommie used to have to sing a song entitled
?Bold Jack Donohoe.? Donohoe, you know, wms the
bushranger w?ho used to bail people up about Liver-
pool and Penrith. He had two followers, Walmsley
and Webber. But one day, w-hen pursued by the
police, these followers deserted Donohoe, leaving him
alone to fight three of the police, who, after a des-
perate encounter, put a couple of bullets into his
breast and killed him. The song described the affray,
and was a favourite with everybody, particularly the
ticket-o?-leave men.
Talking about dancing, it reminds me of a bit of
sport got up by the ticket-o?-leave men in a pub
opposite where Miss Bushell is now. It was kept by
George Freeman, who wms always on the shift. First
in one pub, then another! Well, the men got up a
purse of pennies for a match betwmen Sal the Pieman
(daughter of an old pieman) and Jack Linsley, w T ho
was a big lump of a boy then, and used to knock
about, like most of the youngsters of those days, bare-
footed. Blind Johnnie, the fiddler, played for the
match. The pair danced on the board in their bare
feet. The only step they knew wms ?straight fives,??
and at it they went. For further fun, instead of
declaring one a winner, they made it end in a scramble
between the two. How they rolled over one another
picking up those pennies! Jack, as I said before,
58
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


eventually got into Parliament, and died a wealthy
man.
Over seventy years ago a Mr. Beazley kept a pub
where the late Mr. W. H. H. Becke once lived. He
was an enterprising fellow, and kept two sailing
vessels, trading from Windsor to St. Albans, and
doing remarkably well. He owned the house he lived
in, and, among other places, the pub next door, kept
by Dan Dickens, whose two daughters were burnt to
death one night. They went down into the cellar to
draw some rum by candle light, and the spirits ignited.
Mr. Beazley had a-very large family of good, respect-
able sons and daughters, of whom Mrs. James Holmes,
was one. He sold out his house property for �1,500,
and opened another hotel, in the building once occu-
pied by Mr. E. Board. It was originally only ' one-
storey, and belonged to the Cope family, Mrs. Cope
adding the top storey. For a long time it was kept
as a pub, and was largely patronised by Mr. Beazley?s
down-the-river clients.
I notice that the Bank of New South Wales has
demolished the old brick stable, put up by the late
Mr. James Hale, at the rear of the establishment.
It was splendidly built, and floored with white stone.
On. the spacious loft Mr. Hale once gave a grand ball.
I think it was at the time of the first race meeting
on Dargin?s course. A large crowd attended. Hale
subsequently resided at Fairfield, where he died.
Others who used to give swell balls in those olden
days were William Cox, of Clarendon; Mr. W. Cox,
Hobartville; Mr. S. North, Police Magistrate of
Windsor, who lived in old Government House; Mr.
Bell, of ?Belmont?; and Captain Cox, who lived at
Fairfield before Mr. Hale. Clarendon proper was
then near Clifton, Mr. Arthur Dight?s residence.
Between it and Richmond was Little Clarendon. At
Little Clarendon, in the early days, lived Mr. Edward
Roberts, the founder of the Roberts family.
59
SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE


Those were the palmy days of the old brickfields,
Windsor, and among the men who used to make their
money there were the two Butlers, one nicknamed
?Daphne? and the other ?Ned the Whisperer,?
ironically termed so because when he spoke he could
be heard a mile off, as the saying is?and especially
when he was fishing!
In that locality, and near the present convent,
stood ?The Rising Sun,? built by an old military
pensioner named Heath. After he left it the late
Jim Dorset, grandfather to Mr. George D. Wood,
lived there, and used to run a lot of water trucks
for years, supplying Windsor. I remember some of
his drivers. One was Miley; another, Bob Fitz, who
had a habit of every now and then looking up at
the sun; and a third a chap we called ?Not Net? ?
he could not say ?Not Yet.? A lot of old hands will
remember these characters.
Another publican?but not of the very early days
??was Frank McDonnell, an Irishman, who kept a
place opposite the present Salvation Army Barracks.
He was uneducated, but a prominent identity in local
politics?a keen supporter of Mr. Wm. Walker. When
any of Mr. Walker?s opponents were spouting,
McDonnell, who always wore a block hat, long black
coat, black handkerchief round his neck, and yellow
vest, would turn up, and after walking up and down
the crowd for a while, would suddenly stop in the
middle of the speech, and ask, ?Pwhat about the tay
and sugar?? Then with a satisfied grunt, he would
go and tell everyone the candidate could not answer
him. A peculiar weakness!
Speaking of the old characters of Windsor, I was
nearly forgetting Dunne the plasterer?a civil, nice
old fellow, and a great tradesman. He plastered the
two houses occupied by the doctors, and left the
walls with a face just like glass. The juveniles were
fond of Dunne, who used to interest them with
accounts of the hunts with the hounds in Ould Ireland,
60
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


?Tell us the names of the dogs again,? they would ask.
Then Dunne would rattle over his list, which used
to amuse the' ?nippers? immensely?Touser, Sanko,
Tippo, Flora, Hector, Bully, Nero, Rover, Dido, Juno.
The poor old chap came to a bad end. He was
burnt to death, somewhere in the vicinity of the
wheelwright shop later occupied by Mr. John Jones,
near the South Creek bridgehouse.
Again, I must not forget ?6-cwt. Cooper.? This
?hard case? worked for my mother, who had a
cooperage in George Street, and also employed two
nail-makers. There were no imported nails then, you
know; all the builders were supplied with that handy
commodity from my mother?s shop.
Well, one of the Doyles from down the river?the
great sporting family already referred to ?backed
the cooper to carry 6-cwt. of sand fifty yards. It was
for �5 or �lO aside. He was a powerfully-built Irish-
man. After doing half the distance he let his load
drop. They did not put it properly on his shoulders,
he complained. However, the peculiar nickname by
which he then became known w r as never dropped!
The father of the late Sir James Martin was, I
think, coachman to one of the Governors; and I well
remember young Jimmie as a boarder at Cassidy?s
school, Windsor, for a while. Later on he was
articled to the celebrated George Robert Nichols, and
when he finished his term he came up here to stand
for Cook and Westmoreland, of which constituency
the river at Windsor was a boundary, and Wilber-
force the chief polling place. The electorate ran as
far as Hartley. I remember the morning ?Jimmie?
arrived at Windsor, and put up at Ridge?s hotel. He
had a green gig, and his driver was an Irishman
in a green coat. I don?t know if the horse was green,
but ?Jimmie? was not!
The opponent was Judge Cheeke, a fine fellow, and
a great sportsman, too. He used to visit Windsor
81
SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE


as District Court Judge. Well, Martin beat the Judge,
and thus made his entry into political life.
But, Attorney-General Plunkett raised a point,
upon which Martin was ousted. The property quali-
fication applied then. Martin needed to own �2,000
worth; and as a matter of fact he did not own 2,000
shillings. Robert Fitzgerald came to the rescue and
?gave? him a property to that value; and the electors
put him in again. Some of the other side then taxed
Martin with perjury. They regarded the ?gift? of
the land as not bona fide, and contended that he could
not swear to the contrary. The late John Tloskisson,
founder of the well-known Clarendon family, was a
great admirer of Martin. ?Put him out again,? said
Iloskisson, ?and we will put him in again!?
The reason I remember the whole affair so well was
this. I was a boy in the band at the time, and we
went up to a polling booth at Kurrajong, and played
all the way to Wilberforce, where the declaration
was made. And that night we played for him at
Windsor, where a dance was given at Panton?s. When
going away Martin left �l6 for the band ?sixteen
players, including the boy (myself), �1 each. I was
in great glee at the idea of getting a whole �1 to
myself. I was going to take it all home to Mother,
who, although then struggling, had spared no pains
and expense in fitting me up with the blue jacket
and yellow braid and belt, and making me look spic
and span to go and play for Mr. Martin. But a
meddlesome fool of a fellow named Fitzgerald, a
barber in Hangman?s Row, who was always putting
in his spoke when it was not wanted, considered I
was too young to draw �l, the same as the rest. And
so they gave me only 6/-. It nearly broke my little
heart!
One more early incident I recall in the life of
?Jimmie? Martin. When Wentworth was, on one
Occasion, leaving for England he sang out from the
62
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


ship?s side to ?Grandfather? Hoskisson, ?Look after
Martin! He?s a coining man!? Subsequent events
proved the correctness of the prophecy. The name
of Sir James Martin became interwoven in the colony?s
history.
Among the publicans I can remember of fifty or
sixty years ago were P. Byrnes (who occupied the
site of Mr. Jos. Ward?s store of to-day), Tom Norris
(whose place, where Mr. Gow resides, w T as the scene
of much cockfighting, which was legal in those days),
Win. Cross, George Loder, Nellie Donnelly, Jack
Rafter, Morgan Carroll, Ben. Bullock, Neddie Robin-
son, Mrs. E. Smith, John Coffee (the first to open
an hotel where Dr. Callaghan resided for years),
Johnny Daley, Jim Dorset, Thompson (father of the
veteran mailman, Tommy Thompson), John Noakes
Fisher, Thos. Dargin, also his mother, ?Smith the
Ginman,? John Barker, Walter Blanchard, W.
Gosper, and a man by the name of Brown, who had
five daughters as fine as one would wish to meet;
Mrs. Dorset, Mrs. Chas. Barker, Mrs. James Norris,
Mrs. Lucy Upton, and Mrs. Pearson.
Others have already been referred to.
Thompson?s pub was where Mr. Ted Day lived in
Macquarie Street. There were three houses there
conjoined. The other two were occupied by a bank
and by Mr. Walker (the schoolmaster, father of Hon,
William).
Thompson had the first billiard table that ever came
to Windsor. It was not of slate, though?only wood;
and how the balls would rattle over it!
One of the earliest hotels was kept by Mrs. Dargin,
mother of the old Dargin family?John, William (who
fought Ned Chalker for the championship), Thomas
(who kept the White Swan), Joseph (father of the
late James Dargin, who died at the age of 82), and
three daughters?all fine, strapping, straight men and
women, typical Hawkesbury cornstalks.

SOMETHING ABOUT DAN MAYNE


Why did we have such fine big natives in those
days? Because the fathers and mothers were strong
and healthy, and married no blood relations. The
food was plain, but good. There was the best of beef
and mutton, poultry and bacon. They grew too much
to sell?feasted on it themselves. The boys grew into
manhood without drinking alcohol, or smoking. The
favourite quencher was lemon syrup, ginger beer,
or cloves. Now the natives begin to smoke at 8 or
10, and drink very soon afterwards, and I don?t know
but what in another thirty years our race will be too
small even for jockeys!
A PIONEER-HENRY KABLE.
THROUGH the courtesy of Mr. Walter L. Kable,
P.L.G.A., P.S.P,A? of Bathurst, and a native of Pitt
Town, I produce herewith a particularly interesting
historical sketch of one of the oldest, if not the oldest,
families of the Hawkesbury. The subject matter of
this sketch has been carefully compiled and was
secured from Mr. Kable first hand for publication
in the Windsor and Richmond Gazette.
Descendants of the original Kable family are so
numerous that they have spread to almost every nook
and corner of Australia, and even in Tasmania and
New Zealand the name may be frequently met with.
The original Mr. Kable and the three subsequent
generations carried out the old biblical injunction ?To
increase and multiply and replenish the earth.? ? As
a consequence the Hawkesbury district proved too
small to hold them all, and they spread out wherever
the old pioneering instinct led them. Members of
the old family followed the opening up of the West,
the rush towards Queensland and West Australia, and
moved along the track where anything ?was doing.?
In the western districts of New South Wales there
are families of Kables about Bathurst, Newbridge,
Peak Hill, Cowra, and away out to Cobar and on to

the Never Never. They are in Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, Perth, etc., and one could not stray far in
any direction without coming in touch with one of
them.
Henry Kable came to Australia as a free settler
in Governor Phillip?s first fleet in 1788. As the story
is told, when rowing ashore the boat grounded on the
sand, and Henry Kable, taking Governor Phillip on
his shoulders carried him ashore at Sydney Cove?
this was the first landing. Henry Kable married
Susanna Holmes soon after landing, she being a first
fleeter also. The wedding ceremony was performed
by the Rev. Richard Johnson. This was the first
wedding in Australia. There were, in all, eight
children of the marriage, the first, a boy, who died
in infancy in 1792, was buried in the oldest of
cemeteries, the site of the present Town Hall, Sydney.
There is a record of the oldest grate with the oldest
stone slab, bearing the verse:?
Oli! cruel death, that could not spare,
A loving child that now lies here;
Great loss to those he left behind,
He eternal joys will find.
There were three girls, Dinah, Susanna and Eunice.
Dinah married William Gaudry, who was a clerk in the
Chief-Secretary?s Office, and lived close to where the
Port Jackson Hotel now stands in George Street North.
Of the marriage there were three sons and one
daughter. William Gaudry died on January 3 1816,
and was the first to be buried in the Kable?s? vault
in St. Matthew?s Church cemetery, Windsor. His
widow afterwards married John Teale, who was a
miller at Windsor. In March, 1855, one of the news-
papers of the time had the following notice:?
DEATH OF THE OLDEST WHITE AUSTRALIAN".
On Friday last Mrs. Dinali Teale, widow of the late
John Teale, miller, of Windsor, died at her residence in
Macquai ie-street. Mrs. Teale was the second white person
c
65
A PIONEER?HENRY KABLE


born in Australia and the first to live to maturity. Mrs.
Teale?s father, the late Henry Kable, was the first man of
Governor Philip?s party to set foot ashore at Sydney in the
name of the British Government.?
The issue of her second marriage was two daughters
and three sons. Joseph and Henry Teale were well
known all over the State. The father, John Teale,
died on September 25th, 1852, v and is buried in the
Kable vault. Susanna Kable married Dr. Mileham,
an early surgeon, who died at over 80 years of age
and was buried in the old sandhill cemetery, Devon-
shire Street, now the site of the Central Railway
Station. His widow received a pension of �IOO a year
for nearly 60 years before she died (Susanna was only
24 years of age when she married Dr. Mileham). At
Yanderville, near Camden, where she is buried in the
old cemetery at The Oaks beside her brother Henry,
the following inscriptions are on their tombstones: ?
1. ?In memory of Susanna Mileham, died June 20th, 1885,
aged 89 years. She hath done what she could.?
2. ?Sacred to the memory of Henry Kable, born February
17th, 1786, died May 15th, 1852.?
The third girl, Eunice, married Mr. Robert Fitz, a
man of some note in Windsor and who was Clerk
of Petty Sessions from 1817 to 1835. He arrived in
Australia in the ship Pitt on April 11, 1800. Of
boys, Edgar died on April 28, 1849, aged 42. George
kept an hotel (the Crown and Anchor), at Windsor,
1822, and later at Gorman?s Hill, Bathurst. His
descendants are scattered about the State in various
towns. John was the father of a large family, the
names of his children being:?Eliza, Emma, Julia,
John, William, Charles, George, Edgar, James,
Prosper, Josephine and Caroline. The original Henry,
founder of the family, possessed trading instinct and
money-making ability, and seemed to be a favourite
with the early Governors, with the exception of Bligh.
Not long after the official landing took place, Henry
66

Kable was appointed Chief Constable of the settle-
ment, a position he held for some time. When the
settlement grew, he resigned and started a store-
keeping- business. His store was somewhere about
where No. 4 Police Station is now (George Street
North), at one time called The Rocks. He made
money there and afterwards removed to Windsor in
1800. He had several coaches running from Kable
Street.
When he was, in 1801, a member of the firm Kable,
James Underwood and Simeon Lord (large ship-
owners engaged in the sealing trade in Bass Straits?
H. Records, Vol. 5, page 311), and having vessels
trading on the Hawkesbury and elsewhere, trouble
arose on account of refusing to comply with some
new taxation regulations introduced by Governor
Bligh, whereby vessels entering the harbour would
not be allowed to lay out in the stream. Instructions
v ere sent to owners that all vessels must come to
the wharves, tie up and pay wharfage duties. This
Kable, Underwood and Lord refused to do, and so the
trouble started. Bligh, who was looked upon by the
majority of business people and others as being a
tyrant, threatened to arrest all who disobeyed
his orders. Kable & Co. wrote the Governor direct,
with the result that in the Sydney Gazette of 16th
August, 1807, the following paragraph appeared:?
On Tuesday, 11th August, a bench of magistrates
was ? conveynetl ? for the purpose of receiving under
consideration a letter on the evening before, addressed
to His Excellency the Governor, by Messrs. Lord,
Kable, and Underwood, which was couched in im-
proper terms, and highly derogatory to His Excel-
lency s high rank and authority. The Bench, ofter
a long deliberation, thought it proper to pass a censure
on the same, ? and to order that the subscribing parties
should be imprisoned one calendar month, and each
pay a fine of �IOO to the King.?
67
A PIONEER?HENRY KABLE


Mr. Bladen, the historian, adds to this: ?It was not
stated who the magistrates were, nor whether Lord,
Kable and Underwood were called upon for any
defence. ? ? Some of the early governors did not pay
much heed to the legal rights of individuals. King
applauded Marsden for flogging a free man on the
spot, because he would not work for the general good
in rescuing property and stock at the Hawkesbury,
when the big flood of March, 1806, was subsiding.
Robert Campbell, at the trial of Mac Arthur, for
?various misdemeanors and outrageous offences? (Feb-
ruary, 1803), stated that he had always conceived that
the Governor could give such orders as he thought
proper, even though they might be repugnant to the
law of the land, and he stated that such had been done
in the past. ? ?
The following is a copy of the order for the con-
finement of Lord, Kable, and Lnderwood: lo Daniel
McKay.?Receive into your custody Messrs. Lord,
Kable and Underwood, committed by a Bench of
Magistrates for one calendar month from this date.
For which this shall be your authority, 11th August,
1807. Rich?d Atkins, J.A.?
George Gaudry, mentioned above, was a bit of a
boxer in his time. Amongst others he fought Bishop
on the Windsor racecourse, and his half-brother, Joe
Teale, fought Sparks (after his return from England)
at Cook?s River, and beat him. Sporting boys were
those Hawkesbury natives!
In the old cemetery at Cobbity is an ancient monu-
ment, which records the death of Captain Wild, of
the British Army, who obtained from Governor
Darling 2,000 acres of land, and 200 additional acres
?in lieu of rock,? at Yanderville, on condition that
he maintained 60 Government men (convicts). George
Gaudry, the grandson of Henry Kable, was the ovei-
seer of this "property. Emiline Gaudry, the sister
of George, the overseer, married John Wild, son of

THOSE WERE THE DAYS


the captain, they being the parents of William Vander-
meuluen Wild, a barrister-at-law, who, at the age of
23, was chosen to represent Camden, in the first re-
formed Parliament, that of 1859. Mr. Wild died
young, in May, 1861, in his 26th year, and was buried
in the old cemetery, St. Stephen?s, Newtown, and to
his memory there is a mural tablet in St. James?s
Church, King Street. Good sterling colonists, and
prolific, were the Kables and the Gaudrys.
In 1922 (July), at the mature age of 94 years, the
late Mrs. John Henry Kable passed peacefully away
at the residence of her son, Mr. Ophir Kable, Lambert
Street, Bathurst. Bom in O?Connell Street, Sydney
(one of a family of fifteen), she spent many years
of her young womanhood in the Rylstone district.
She was a daughter of the late Mr. John Mills, one
of the earliest Englishmen who came to Australia, and
who was a teacher for some years at Kurrajong. In
the Rylstone district she lived for many years with
her husband, who was engaged in farming activities.
About 1870 they disposed of their Rylstone property
and settled on the more fertile lands in Bathurst,
where they were very successful in life. With the
exception of a few years? residence in Sydney, they
lived in Bathurst practically for the last fifty years.
Her husband predeceased her by about six years.
The late Mrs. Kable possessed a particularly strong
constitution, and enjoyed excellent health until a few
months ago. She had wonderful vision, and right to
the end of her days did not need the aid of spectacles
to read her daily paper. A family of seven survive
her. They are Messrs. G. M. Kable (Orton Park),

A PIONEER?HENRY KABLE


THE BLACK HORSE HOTEL, RICHMOND.
Who?er has travelled life?s dull round,
Where?er his stages may have been,
May sigh to think he still has found
�/ o
His warmest welcome at an Inn.
THE genius of romance haunts the Black Horse Inn
at Richmond. One hundred and three years ago wine
and spirits were retailed in this house, which stands
upon the high road of the picturesque town. It is
adjacent to St. Peter?s Church of England, and the
old churchyard where Charles Harpur used to wander
in his youth, and where Margaret Catchpole, the
heroine of Cobbold?s stirring novel, was buried, and
where Gould, the ornithologist, shot his first pair of
Wonga Wonga pigeons. In the distance, cornfields
gleam and lucerne plots reveal thW purple flowers,
and across a vast expanse of rural scenery, the Hawkes-
bury, like a silver-backed serpent, drags its lengthy
coils through long vistas of verdant willows that droop
to kiss the rippling surface of the river.
The beautiful country around the ancient hostelry
was explored by Governor Phillip shortly after the
foundation of the colony, and in the course of time
settlers established themselves on the rich tracts he
had discovered. As floods frequently destroyed the
homes of the pioneers as well as the fruits of their
labours, Governor Macquarie, at the beginning of his
epoch-making administration, visited the Hawkesbury
district and marked out a number of towns on
elevated ground, where settlers and their families
might live in safety and preserve their stock and
harvests from the ravages of flood. Pitt Town, Castle-
reagh, Wilber force, Windsor, and Richmond were the
towns he founded, and the last-named was particularly
well-designed, for the streets are straight, fairly wide,
and intersect each other at right angles. There are
a number of buildings in Richmond; some were erected
70
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


seventy, eighty, or ninety years ago, but others display
the architecture of a more modern period. An air of
serenity, reminiscent of a bygone age, still hangs over
the township. Heavily-laden waggons, drawn by
bullocks, or old-time vehicles, or, perhaps, a hardy
old stockman on horseback, is occasionally seen in the
vicinity of the Black Horse ?fitful glimpses of the
past, which appear and disappear when least
expected!
There are several fine hotels in Richmond to-day?
the Imperial, the Commercial, the Royal, and the
Black Horse, but the last, from its historic and
romantic interest, takes precedence, not only of hotels
in Richmond, but of every hotel in the Commonwealth,
and, therefore this article will be devoted to an
examination of the principal historic and romantic
details associated with the ancient tavern of the Black
Horse.
The first certificate granting a license to the inn
is extant, and bears date 20th February, 1819. How-
ever, there are some indications that liquor was sold
on the spot before that time. One old resident quoted
a tradition that the blacks held a corroboree in the
yard of the hostelry in the year 1816. Then there
is the opinion of Mrs. Ashton, a native of Richmond,
to the effect that the hotel existed long before she
was born. Other old residents specify in a vague way
certain incidents as having occurred prior to the
license dated 1819. But after a careful consideration
of a number of different statements, it is found that
there is no ground for making any definite assertions
about dates previous to the year 1819, although there
are indications that the Black Horse was doing busi-
ness in beer and ardent spirits before that date.
In my first volume of ?The Good Old Days,? there
is an exact copy of what is believed to be the first
certificate granting a license to host Randall of the
Black Horse. As this historic document is very in-
71
THE BLACK HOKSE HOTEL, EICHMOND


teresting, and is drawn in a quaint form, the full text
is re-printed. It reads as follows:
?At a general meeting of His Majesty?s Justices of the
Peace for the said county (Cumberland) for licensing per-
sons to keep common inns and ale houses, on the twentieth
day of February, in the 59th year of the reign of our
Sovereign Lord George the Third, and in the year of our
Lord, one thousand, eight hundred and nineteen.
?We, His Majesty?s Justices of the Peace for the said
county, whose hands and seals are hereunto set, assembled
at the said meeting, do allow and license Paul Randall, at
the sign of the Black Horse Prince, in Richmond, within
the said colony, to keep a common ale-house, or victualling
house, and to issue and sell Beer, Ale, Cyder, and spirituous
liquors in the house wherein he dwelleth, and not elsewhere,
for one whole year, from the twentieth day of this present
month, February, and no longer; so as the true assize in
bread, beer, ale, and other liquors be duly kept; and no
unlawful game or games, drunkenness, or any other dis-
order be suffered in his house, yard, garden, or backside,
but that the good order and rule be maintained and kept
therein according to the laws of Great Britain, and the
general laws of this colony in that behalf.
?Given under our hands and seals the day and year above
written.

[Edwin Walker, J.P., is the name of the other magis-
trate.]
Paul Randall, who is named in the foregoing- cer-
tificate, was a well-known colonist, and his contem-
poraries had great respect for himself and a particular
regard for the tavern, of which he was the owner
as well as the licensee. Mrs. Ashton, an old identity
of Richmond, already referred to, informed the writer
of these reminiscences that she knew Mr. Randall and
his wife??a reg?lar ole lady??and had conversed
with them often when she was a child. She described
host Randall, of the Black Horse, as a short stout
man, and the hostess, his wife, was short and thick
set, like her husband. Incidentally, Mrs. Ashton re^
72
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


marked that ?you couldn?t see what he was drawin?
for you in ?em times,? because the glasses were always
filled behind a screen, after which they were handed
to the guests through a little square opening, still
to be seen, in the wall. This old lady also said that
she had seen convicts stripped of their shirts and
flogged up the main street of the town; and further
stated that the blackfellows used to infest the place
when she was young, and would pester the towns-
people for a gill of rum or a pipe of tobacco.
When Mrs. Ashton had told her story, her daughter,
who, by the way, had just turned seventy-two, took
a turn in the conversation, and had a fund of interest-
ing reminiscences to relate. Her nonagenarian
mamma was born in Richmond, she said, and was
left a widow about forty-four years before. The late
Mr. Ashton arrived in the colony in the year 1818,
and with him came a shipmate, of the name of Mason.
Mason subsequently became chef at the Black Horse,
and, according to tradition, turned out some jolly
fine dinners in his time. The fame of his dishes spread
across the mountains and the plains, and many a
weary wayfarer was regaled with the appetising viands
which he put upon the board of the old pub. He
was believed to be a veritable Napoleon among the
knights of the oven, and swayed his rolling pin, as
if it was the sceptre of a ruler, in the kitchen of the
tavern where he was boss for many years. When
poor old Mason slipped his moorings the epicureans
of the period lost a good friend and the old inn half
its fame.
The same lady related a very amusing episode about
the state of affairs in Richmond the night old Mr,
Bowman was elected to the first Parliament (she thinks
it was the first) under Responsible Government. He
was returned on a majority of four or five votes, and
on the proclamation of the poll the crowd, who had
previously been well filled with liquid comfort, went
73
THE BLACK HORSE HOTEL, RICHMOND


mad with joy. Immediately they pounced on Mr,
Bowman and bore him through the town shoulder-
high, seated in a blue chair. A number of his sup-
porters ran before him like the lictors of a Roman
consul or the heralds of a king. They dashed into
the highways and the byways, and howled forth the
glad tidings of their man?s success outside the street
doors, and many an honest townsman was recalled
7 �/
from the arms of Morpheus by the uproarious be-
haviour of the enthusiastic champions of the Bowman
cause.
Another interesting matter drawn from the same
source was an account of a banquet given to Mr.
Bowman at the Black Horse after successfully con-
cluding one of his electoral campaigns. The board
was spread in the great room of the inn, and Mrs.
Ashton?s daughter was proud of the fact that she
waited on the table on the occasion. She carried in
the steaming joints and w r ell-seasoned poultry, and
also set down the tarts and jellies before snch men
as Parson Elder and Messrs. Tebbutt, Sloper Cox,
Arthur Bight and a few more ?old timers,? who
have long ago journeyed to the wan shades of that
dim port whence no traveller returns.
Miss Randall became the owner of the Black Horse
after the death of her parents, and she espoused Br.
Seymour. They were the hosts for many years. The
doctor was a bright old chap, and often sat among
the village statesmen smoking his pipe and quaffing
his pot with the rest of them. Mrs. Bailey, a resident
of Richmond, and a relative to the present owner of
the hotel, possesses a portrait of ancient hostess Sey-
mour, and, according to its lineaments, one is inclined
to surmise that she was a lady of the Mistress Quickly
class, and knew how to deal with the roystering
cavaliers of the road whenever they waxed merry or
vicious.
It was Mrs. Seymour?s name (Margaret) which
74
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


found place on the signboard for years, and until
some new and officious official came along and, greatly
to the chagrin of the Doctor, insisted upon his name
being substituted. And so it remained until Dr.
Seymour died in 1858, when his widow?s name again
appeared on the board. The hotel was the resort of
Sydney?s most noted gentry, and in the register could
be seen the names of G. R. Dibbs, Charlie Cooper,
Jas. Comrie, S. Lassetter, H. C. Dangar, T. S. Mort,
Matthew Henry Stephen, H. P. Abbott, and Heaven
knows how many others. Here Judge Cheeke always
stayed when attending District Court at Windsor,
and his racehorses were stabled here (when being
trained for the Windsor races) by John Tait. Mrs.
Seymour was politeness ffself, and her quiet dignity
commanded respect from all. She was a born
organiser, and her whole staff were trained by her ?
there was William Sly, her outdoor manager, her four
maids (sisters), who were with her over 40 years, and
only dispersed after her death in 1875.
By her will Mrs. Seymour bequeathed this historic
house to a child whom she had adopted, named Sophia
Westbrook, who was a step-sister to Mrs. Ashton, to
whom reference has been made several times. Miss
Westbrook married William Sly, of Richmond, and
they continued the business, and ran the hotel in its
palmiest days. On one occasion Sir John and Lady
Young stayed at the inn, and the Governor?s wife
was presented with a bouquet on her arrival at the
door by a daughter of the hostess.
When the Slys passed away their son William be-
came possessed of the property. He was born in the
Black Horse, and his mother 1 was in the house as a
baby, and used to play under the weather-worn cedar
tree which still stands beside the tavern-door. But
in later years a number of persons have kept the
hotel. Among them were William Sly, and Messrs.
Reid, Arkenstall, Folbigg, Forfar, and Captain Pear-
75
THE BLACK HORSE HOTEL, RICHMOND


son, and ?Sportsman O?Keefe, of Murrumburra, ??
who was also a champion cross-country rider in his
time, and, as an amateur jockey, used the ?whale-
bone ? and the ?hooks? with great success in some
big racing events on well-known courses in the southern
district.
Many an old stager over seventy years now used
to toddle into the bar for a bottle of rum or a pot
of ale in childhood, when his parents returned from
work in the fields. And the signpost of the hostelry,
more than fifty years ago, was used as a winning-
post when the sports of that period took to galloping
their nags up the main street on the Sabbath. The
street was pretty sandy then, but it was a good make-
shift track. Often the hardy equestrians fought a
big battle for a lead in those erratic events, and
longed to gain the prize?a couple of bottles of rum;
and in struggling for victory it was not an uncommon
thing to see a few of the riders come off their mounts
head first, and plough a two-yard furrow in the road-
way ere they got up smiling or cursing their bad luck.
Many of the early Richmond hostelries have been
washed away by the swirling stream of time, and
their genial hosts have been driven off the wreckage
by the unrelenting hand of Death. There used to
be the Bow and Arrow, kept, it is said, at one time,
by the sturdy old pioneer, George Bowman, and the
Union Inn, which was run by honest Tom Eather.
Robert Anil flourished cork-screws at the General
Darling, and at the sign of the Plough, Thomas Mor-
timer welcomed the traveller. In the Weleome Inn the
cups were filled by Chris. Moniz, and Thomas Parnell
turned on the taps at the Packhorse, while Paul
Randall doled out liquid joy at the Black Horse Prince.
Then there was the Woolpack, over the river, where
one John Town, junr., disposed hospitality, and in
the same locality John Town, senr., presided at the
George the Fourth. The Black Horse and the Wool-
76
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


pack are still in existence, but the others have long
ago drifted into the land of forgetfulness, like the
jolly old ? ? hearts of gold ? ? who kept them. The Wool-
pack, now known as the Travellers? Rest, is at North
Richmond, bearing another name. It stands almost
on the river?s bank, and not far from the spot where
the toll bar used to be in the droving days. For the
drovers used to put up there before railways pierced
the interior. Those were the times when gold flowed
into the till in streams, because ? ? bosses of the road ?
did not stop at one or two. If they sat down to a
game of cards or rattled the dice-box at sunset they
did not stir until sunrise, and the games went on
merrily, interrupted only when someone called a
shout, and flung a sovereign on the counter in the
off-hand style. Then the lads clinked their drinking
cups in royal style, and tossed off bumpers of the
good old stuff, which never failed to make tears spring
into the eyes of the hardest drinker in the land. Alas!
that happy age has fled for ever, and only the Wool-
pack and 'the Black Horse stand as solitary emblems
of the past. Hosts, pubs, patrons ?all are gone now!
But ?
?How those days when life was young
Come back to us; how clearly I recall
Even the yarns Jack Hall invented, and the songs Jem Ropei
sung;
And where are now Jem Roper and Jack Hall??
SURGEON ARNDELL.
THE death of Mr. Thomas Arndell, which took place
at Cattai on 30th October, 1907, snapped another link
of the historic chain which binds the present to the
past. He was a son of the late Thomas Arndell, and
a grandson of the late Dr. Thomas Arndell, who came
out from England in 1786 as assistant surgeon to
the then new "settlement of New South Wales. Both
Dr. Arndell and his wife were buried in St. Matthew?s
C.E. Cemetery, Windsor. Here is a copy of the

point you to be Assistant Surgeon to the Settlement within
our Territory called New South Wales.
?You are, therefore, carefully and diligently to discharge
the duty of Assistant Surgeon by doing and performing all
and all manner of things therein belonging; And you are

of War.
?Given at Our Court of St. James?s, the Twenty Fifth

Reign.
?By His Majesty?s Command, ?SYDNFY ?
Until the year 1792, Dr. Arndell continued to act
as assistant surgeon, when he asked to be relieved from
office. This is a copy of the letter he wrote to
Governor Phillip, with the subsequent correspondence
on the matter: ?
?Parramatta,
10th July, 1792.
Sir-
Finding myself advancing in years, and wishing to pro-
vide for a family who depend on me for support, I take the
liberty to request that your Excellency will be pleased to
move H.M. Ministers to permit me to retire from the ser-
vice with such part of my pay as my services in this
country may be thought to merit; and that the land which
I have begun to cultivate with a view to becoming a settler
may be granted to me for that purpose.
I have, etc.,
(Signed). Thomas Arndell.?
?Right Hon. IJy. Dundas to Lieut.-Governor Grose.
Whitehall, London,
30th June, 1793.
Sir, ?
The request of Mr. Arndell* the assistant surgeon, to
be permitted to retire with some allowance and become a
78
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


settler is complied with, and he ?will in consequence be
allowed �5O p.a. from the time his pay as assistant sur-
geon ceases. j am e t c ,,
(Signed) Hy. Dundas.?
The land thus acquired, situated at Cattai Creek,
has never passed from the Arndell family. Di. Ain-
dell in all his papers referred to the property as
?Catty?; then the name became corrupted to
? Cataic. ? Now the estate is known as ? Caddai,
while the creek and locality are shown on the parish
maps as ?Cattai.? .
The subject of this notice lived on a portion ot
Caddai granted to him by his father. The memorable
flood of 1867 swept away most of the buildings, the
homestead being the only one left; the farm was
practically ruined, and he never lived there again.
Then he removed to the old homestead of his father,
and later to ?Macquarie,? where he died.
One of the earlier floods is spoken of in some of
Dr. Arndell?s reports, copies of whjch we give:?
?Mr. Thomas Arndell, to Governor King.

?Hawkesbury,
2sth March, 1806.
I have to inform your Excellency that the water is
going off fast, but have with great anxiety to say that
most of the settlers with their families must be supplied
from the store. I have just now sent a boat to the relief
of nearly 200 persons that have been two or three days
without anything, and some without clothing, in the woods,
for which purpose I have expended 6 bushels of wheat. I
beg leave to mention that if boats and men are properly
employed much may be saved. The water was within 18
inches of my house at Catty. The water was five feet over
the rock at the corner of the creek, from which you may
judge the dreadful ravage that must have happened.
I remain, etc.,

AN OLD CO-OPERATIVE CUSTOM.
IN the days before the stove was invented and intro-
duced, the co-operative custom of one housewife doing
in turn the Sunday baking for a number of her best
neighbours was much in vogue in Richmond. Old
hands will recollect that the meal of the week (a
roast joint usually) had to be cooked either in the
camp oven, or by a more tedious process still, viz.,
roasting it before the fire, where it had to be con-
tinually attended to to keep it revolving, unless they
could afford to purchase a roasting jack, which could
be wound up like a clock, and, when set going, would
turn the joint sufficiently until it was cooked to a turn.
Even then there was the basting to be attended to.
Well, to save all this trouble, and allow the over-
worked mother to attend church with other members
of her family, one old identity, James Martin Kelly,
would light his brick oven, and for a small remunera-
tion would bake all dinners sent to him. It was no
uncommon thing to see a score of dishes of different
dimensions, some containing shoulders of mutton, with
potatoes, others a joint of beef, with Yorkshire pud-
ding, a dish of ducks, or a sucking pig. And the
most convenient part of it was the owners could leave
80
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


their dinner at the bakehouse when going to church,
and call for it when returning home. Sometimes,
however, things would get a bit mixed. There were
often dishes of a similar kind, and one boy who
would not be too familiar with his mother?s dish,
would take some other fellow?s. It was a fair ex-
change, but did not happen often. His mother would
know, and the trouble was to discover with whom
they had got mixed up. It was no use letting the
dinner get cold. They could compare dishes later
on, when the contents had disappeared. Besides,
everybody was ravenous. They had been listening to
a long sermon, and a long sermon generally induces
a good appetite, as well as sound sleep.
The same system of co-operative baking was to
some extent in vogue at Windsor in later days?
the housewife sent her Sunday dinner, so far as meat
and poultry was concerned, to the local bakery and
had it sent home done to a turn just in time to be
placed on the table with the vegetables, cooked on
the home fire?there were no ranges in those days,
and the- old camp oven, with its wood coals on top
and its blaze beneath, was one of the finestSmethods
ever devised for turning out a dainty dish of roast
beef or a beautifully browned pair of plump roosters.
? ? When we were boys together, ? ? over 50 years ago,
the Sunday joint was one of immense proportions?
twelve or fifteen pounds of the juiciest cut of the beast,
flanked by Yorkshire pudding, potatoes and pump-
kin, crisp and brown, and with a crackling on the
potatoes which was much relished by the youngsters
of the time. The best beef in those days could be
purchased for twopence per pound?recollect the local
ditty published in the Hawkesbury Times somewhere
in the 70?s, the concluding lines of which were:? ?
I hear with intermittent sobs,
The plaintive wail of peg-legged Hobbs,
Proclaiming round and round and round,
?Prime beef at farthings five a pound*?
81
AN OLD CO-OPEEATIVE CUSTOM


How the thrifty housewife of to-day mourns the ?
fact that such prices should have gone to the limbo
of the past, and that foodstuffs and all else that
enter into general consumption, use and wear should
have soared so high that they are well-night unpro-
curable. It is questionable whether the butcher?s
man', who, in those days, worked from daylight till
dark for 30/- a week and his house supplies of beef
and mutton (men like ?Slim Jim,? who was a noted
character, Harry Tilley, and other Knights of the
Cleaver) were not very much better oft* in health,
morals and pocket than are their successors, who get
big wages, with short hours, have regular holidays?
and for the most part don?t care, a twopenny dump
what happens so that their wages are on hand on a
Saturday night.
Pursuing the matter farther, I have acquired an
extract from an article in the $. M. Herald of recent
date, dealing with the ? ? Co-operative Kitchens, ? ? which
I attach:?
?When Australia was nearly a century younger than to-
day the first imperfect idea of a communal kitchen was in
existence in the family bakehouse, that undertook to cater
for families who were unable to bake in their own homes
and who entrusted their midday dinners to the baker of
their daily bread. The oven that was used was a large
brick one, but not the same as that used for bread, as a
rule, though in smalK settlements like that round old An-
nandale House or round Government House, Parramatta,
the bread baker was also the dinner baker. What a con-
venience this common bakehouse was to the early colonists,
and what comfort it ensured the householder! Meat,
potatoes, and other vegetables could be placed in one dish
and the cost of cooking was 3d., whilst for another penny-
halfpenny a rice pudding or a jam tart could be the com-
pletion of a Sunday midday meal. A cake was 3d., and was
only taken in in the afternoons when the oven was slack-
ing down. Strangely enough, the writer hit upon one of
these now out-of : date establishments lately in a little
outlying suburb of Sydney; and it was proving a great
boon to a number of less well-to-do people in the neighbour-
hood. A very old lady and gentleman living nearby, spoke
82
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


of the great comfort they found from getting a nice meal
cooked for thejp. ?We have two baking dishes and two pie
dishes,? said the aged lady, ?one at home and the other at
the bakehouse, and the butcher'calls for our order and
takes the meat straight to the bakehouse oven at dinner
time. A neighbour?s boy brings it over to us for a penny.
The people are bakers, but are also kindly friends, for they
buy vegetables to go with the meat and make me a pudding
and add the cost of the charge for cooking.? ?If there
?were some of the old bakeries near a ?flat? neighbourhood
it would be a great help,? said a lady who heard of this
instance of one still existing. ?I often long to taste the
flavour of food cooked in a large brick fuel stove, such as
we had in the country in my childhood.?
It used to be a great sight on Sunday mornings to see
the baking dishes carried into or out of the large bakery
which stood behind now where Turner and Henderson?s
premises are situated in Hunter-street. A lane in the
vicinity recalls the name of the old baker who cooked many
good meals for city dwellers in the bygone days, when
Sydney was, comparatively, a very little place. There is
no doubt that with so many modern contrivances and up-
to-date methods, the old style bake-house would be looked
upon, except in exceptional circumstances, as quite behind
the times, but the idea of one establishment serving the
wants of many could be revived with great benefit in an
improved form, and the communal kitchen would not seem
a great innovation, but merely a revival on an improved
scale of what our forbears considered their greatest con-
venience. There are many small centres in the old country
where the family bakehouse is in use for the villagers?
needs; and a newly-arrived emigrant to a small rural place
near Sydney said that what she missed most in Australia
was the general bakehouse where she could have Sunday?s
dinner cooked whilst she went to church.?
THE OLD SQUATTERS? HOTEL.
PROBABLY there are few places in Australia which
can boast of so many antiquated buildings as the
Hawkesbury district. The modern vandal, who can-
not see any good in decayed and crumbling buildings,
looks upon them as an eyesore. I have just seen an
illustration of the ruins of ?The Squatters ? Hotel,?
which, until a few years ago (1915), was standing
at the corner of Wilberforce and Freeman's Reach
83
THE OLD SQUATTERS? HOTEL


Roads, and as a relic of the olden days it must
prove interesting, particularly to the older residents.
In the ?good old days? of its pride, money was
plentiful. One would see in those days as many
teams on the road in a week as he will see in twelve
months now. Scores of boats plied up and down the
river, and farmers, if they did live on frugal fare,
had always a pound in their pockets to spend at
holiday times, and were healthier and hardier than
the generations that have followed. One old hand,
carrying his memory back some three score summers,
says that the building was standing in his earliest
recollections. Comparing the illustration with Old
Government House, the rude architecture is strikingly
similar, but several persons say that the building was
erected since Old Government House ?perhaps about
90 years ago. One of the earliest landlords was a
man named Gardiner. After him came Suffolk, who
dispensed refreshments there over 60 years ago. Cun-
ningham succeeded Suffolk about 1846. During
Suffolk?s occupancy he made additions to the Windsor
side of the building, which was evidently, in the first
place, a farmhouse. After Cunningham came John
Ridge, followed by James Roots, both of whom hailed
from ? ? down the river. ? ? The last occupant was Tom
Ryan, whose name is still inscribed over the door-
way as a ?retailer of fermented and spirituous
liquors.? Tom was a brother of Mr. Johnny Ryan,
who lived for many years opposite the old hostelry.
Ryan conducted it until 1867. The big floods of
1864 and 1867 flooded the building. It has been
unoccupied since 1867 ?except as a stable for stock
or a camping place for tramps. Prior to Tom Ryan?s
reign the old place was a dwelling, and for a short
time was occupied by Mr. John Ryan, whose brother
Tom had been a small squatter on the Lachlan.
Coming to the Hawkesbury he took the place from
John Ryan and re-opened it as an Inn, calling it
84
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


the ?Squatters? Hotel.? Tom Ryan did a good
business, especially in the days of the punt, before
Windsor bridge was in existence. It frequently hap-
pened that something went wrong with the punt ?
a fresh would cause it to overturn, or it would get
stuck in the mud at low tide, and then team after
team would line the two roads for a considerable
distance. This, of course, brought grist to the mill
of Tom Ryan. The present appearances of the place
would lead one to question whether it could have been
a decently conducted hostelry. From information
supplied, we learn that it was a very comfortable old
place, containing 6 or 7 rooms, and was clean, well-
furnished, and well-conducted. Visitors from Sydney
came and stayed for a time for a quiet life after the
turmoil of the town. In the early days, too, there
was considerable boating traffic on the river, and
small craft were always at the wharf. In the early
regatta days the hotel side of the river was quite
gay and lively. Booths w'ere erected, people lined
the river bank, and the hotel did a thriving business.
Unfortunately for the several hosts, it was a place
where considerable credit had to be given, as the
imbiber generally spent his money in Windsor, and
?strapped up? a final drink at the ?Squatters? ?
when making his way home. During Tom Ryan?s
time his brother, John, had charge of the punt. No
doubt if the bricks could speak many queer stories
could be told of the ?Squatters? Hotel.? Some 60
years ago there was a half-way house of call between
Windsor and Wilberforce, known as the ?George and
Dragon,? kept by Richard Cobcroft, the original
member of the family of that name at Wilberforce.
The last license for this house was issued on June
30, 1847. It might be mentioned that there were
two families of Suffolks in the district in the early
days, and the one of that name who kept the old
pub was in no way related to the family of Suffolks

streets is named.

and made way for an up-to-date residence. ?J.C.L.F.]
RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS.
MANY old Hawkesburyites will recollect the name of
Laban White, who in the 70?s resided in the two-
storeyed house in George Street, once the residence
of the Fitzgeralds, later of Mr. Benjamin Richards,
'and, later again, of Mr. D. Holland. He used to
walk up and * down the verandah for hours at a
stretch; a stout old man with frosted hair, who was
universally respected. I don?t know how it is, but
the idea has got into my head that he was also in
some way associated with the building where the late
William Primrose kept a saddler?s shop. That, I
think, was a chemist?s establishment in those days?
one Worms was the proprietor, and the boys of the
time spent hours looking in at the windows at the
great jars of coloured waters.
Another name is brought to mind by the following
paragraph from the Cumberland Argus : ?
?Mr. George Gresty is installed as postmaster at Auburn.
Mr. Gresty is an old Parramatta native, his sister is Mrs.
H. Manse. In the old days George was one of the musical
men of Parramatta.
George Gresty was operator at the Windsor tele-
graph office when it was situate where the local
Council now meets ?the same building. George was
a dandy in those days?he is even now an active-
looking man, though Old Time has whitened his hair
somewhat. I saw him in Sydney not very long ago.
He took part in all the local concerts, being some-
what of a comic singer, and was associated with the
School of Arts. He was of the party of which Bob
Walker, Jint Gosper, Tom Boston, the MeQuade boys,
86
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


Tom Lane, and others whom I forget for the moment,
were members.
Other names that crop up are those of old Jimmy
Whitechureh and Steve the Barber. Jimmy lived
down Kable Street, and was a water-carrier (hq had
a grey horse for years, a champion at going slow),
and he was one of the identities of the town. The
boys used to torture him well nigh to death ?it was
a favourite trick of theirs to call out ?Whoa? to the
old screw' which drew his cart, and the animal would
promptly stop, with the result that ten minutes of
hard belting on the part of Jimmy was necessary
before he could ?get a move on? again. Fox was
another water-carrier ?he lived in Wexford (beg
pardon, Catherine) Street, and had a big family, who
have disappeared among the crowd. Steve the Barber
?to be more accurate, Stephen Milford?claimed to
be a son of the N.S.W. judge of that name; and
he w 7 as a character in his w-ay. He had a saloon
once in what is now the Fitzroy Hotel billiard room
?later he got into Johnston Street, occupying one
of the late Mr. T. Primrose?s houses. He drank very
heavily at times, and painted Windsor a bright ver-
milion?but save for this indiscretion he was a harm-
less poor chap, who, at times, suffered much because
of the precocity of the youth of the neighbourhood.
Remember also that in those days Windsor was
visited bv some of the best dramatic and amusement
companies then touring the State. Harry Rickards
w r as there with a variety company over forty years
ago. Fred Millis, recognised as the world?s prin-
cipal ventriloquist, played at Windsor on more than
one occasion, and as the audiences w r ere small, he
had to ?fold his tent, like the Arabs, and silently
steal aw 7 ay.? J. L. Byers, wdth Julia Hudson (?)
gave entertainments, all in the open air, and one of
the company wmlked a tight rope stretched across
South Creek at the bridge; whilst Madame Anna

Bishop, Carlotta Patti, and other high-toned pro-
fessionals occasionally graced the town with their
presence. Where Miss Bushell kept an hotel, a wax-
works proprietor set up his establishment, and the
children of the town paled and trembled as they
walked through the ?chamber of horrors? upstairs
and saw the murderers and bushrangers, so life-like
and natural were they all. Meantime old man Cain,
known locally as ?Mile-a-minute,? ran his merry-go-
round, and kept at the same time his hotel, after-
wards conducted by Mr. Jas. Walsh, but burned down
some years since. Cain was an active little man, all
bustle and talk and good humour, even though he
had a pretty hard domestic row to hoe.
A paragraph in a recent issue of the Gazette calls
to mind another quaint old character of the Windsor of
over forty years ago?in the person of Neville (I?m
not sure whether he spelled his name in this way, or
whether it was spelled ?Nevell?), who kept a little
shop in Baker Street ?not on the corner, but very
near it. Neville was a slight, short, well-groomed
little old chap, with shining face and slippery hands,
who, in addition to being a tonsorial artist, kept
lollies, marbles, and such other goods as delight the
eyes and excite the cupidity of the juvenile section
of the community, who, in those days did not enjoy
the possession of nearly as much pocket-money as
do the youth of to-day. Though I had forgotten for
years the old man referred to, I can just fancy I
see him now, coming from his back room to answer
the call of a customer in the shop?all apron and
shaving-brush, and with a face which, whilst it shone
again like a brazen cymbal, seldom betrayed feeling
of any description. He was very deaf, and was no
doubt often irritated by the urchins of the neigh-
bourhood; but he seldom betrayed his wrath, and his
countenance was as inexpressive as a wooden block.
His place, like himself, was cleanliness itself ?his
88
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


little hairdressing room was decorated with pictures
and prints, his towels and combs and brushes were
as clean as careful attention could make them?and
he was painfully exact in the matter of cropping
the heads and shaving the faces of his patrons. The
boys used to buy ?commoners? and ?ally tors? and
all that sort of thing from Neville ?and, later on,
when years had passed and the first crop of down
appeared above the surface of our chins, we went
to him to have it garnered, in the hope that frequent
cutting would cause it to grow more rapidly. Poor
old Neville?he passed the way of all flesh; like Mrs.
Gummidge, he was ?a lone, lorn creetur, and the
world went contrairy with him? no doubt. If I
recollect aright, he died at his post, and his shop was
eventually shut up, and the place that had known him
knew him no more.
Mention of Neville calls to mind many other
identities of those youthful days?it is pleasing to
think of them after a comparatively long lapse of
time, for, after all, they are ?a mine of memories.? ?
The old days, the far days,
The ever dear and fair ?
The old days?the lost days?
How lovely they were!
The old days of Morning,
With the dew-bunch on the flowers,
And apple buds and blossoms
Of those old days of ours!
There Avas old Ned the Nailer ?was it Ned or Joe?
He had his forge just about Allen?s bakery, and we
boys used to look in at his windows and watch the
bright sparks fly, and marvel at the rapidity with
which he transformed the thin rods of iron into horse-
shoe nails, and if one of the spectators ventured a
joke, the chances were that he got a rap over the
knuckles with a red-hot piece of iron. There was

recognise his somewhat odd features and form. Peg
Leg Hobbs and Billy O?Rourke, better known as
?Billy the Bell,? were two other personages of note
locally?they were rivals in the bell-ringing pro-
fession, and it was a source of honest amusement to
witness their antics when they hajjpened to meet on
the highway, each with an announcement to make
to an ever-curious public. Old Tommy Burchell, who
lived on the Peninsula, was another identity of those
joyous times?and Darby the Gardener, whose
favourite saying was ?Apples?ll grow again, three
in a bunch. ? ? Kitty was his wife, and she carried
the vegetables round when old Darby looked upon
the wine not wisely but too well.
They were good old times, despite all that is said
to the contrary?good old times for the boys and the
girls of the period; and as one sits down and thinks
them over he needs must yearn?and yearn, alas, in
vain, for their return ?for who would not

THE WINDSOR POST OFFICE.
ACCORDING to the New South Wales Calendar and
General Post Office Directory for 1833, 1834 and
1835, copies of which are in my library, Mr. Robert
Fitz was the Windsor postmaster during 1833 and
1834, and Mr. Henry Bailey in 1835, the latter being
also clerk to the Bench of Magistrates. Whether
these two gentlemen had predecessors in office I can-
not at present say, nor do I know where the post offices
in their charge were situated. The earliest recollections
which I liave of a post office in Windsor, wrote Mr.
John Tebbutt, of the Peninsula, is that of a long
90
THOSE WEEE THE DAYS


weatherboard building which formerly stood on the site
occupied by the residence of the late Mr. William
Gosper in Macquarie Street. This building during the
third decade of last century was the residence of my
grandfather and his family, who, I believe, rented it,
together with a large tract of land extending towards
the present residence of Mr. William Dean, from
the well-known. Rev. Samuel Marsden. After my
family left this dwelling and removed to George
Street into their own new premises it was tenanted
by Mr. John O?Dell, whose figure and personality I
well remember. This must have been in the early
forties. Mr. O?Dell was not only the postmaster but
a brewer as well, for he carried on the brewery busi-
ness in another long weatherboard building, which
stood flush with Macquarie Street, but a little west
of the dwelling. The period to which I refer was
antecedent to the introduction of envelopes and
postage stamps. All letters were then folded and
were secured either with coloured wafers or sealing
wax, or with both. I have even now specimens of
the wafers used and of letters which came through
the post office in those early days. The postage from
Windsor to Sydney was eightpence per half ounce
letter, and the value of the postage was always
marked by the postmaster on the face of the letters.
After some time the post office was removed to the
eastern end of the old building, occupied at present
by Mr. Day, near the Hawkesbury Benevolent
Asylum, also in Macquarie Street. Mr. O?Dell, I
think, carried on the work here, assisted by a man
named Colliss. My recollection of the next immedi-
ate stages in the history are not quite so clear, but I
believe the office was next under the care of Mr. George
Panton in the large building erected by Mr. Burke,
later the property of Dr. Gibson. Subsequently it
was removed to a weatherboard building on the site
of Dyer?s present shops, at the corner of George and
91
THE WINDSOR POST OFFICE


Baker Streets. Here the late Mr. Robert Dick
carried on the work in connection with his grocery
business. Mr. Dick then erected the large business
premises in George Street at present occupied by
Mr. Campbell, and there continued the combined work.
I do not remember the post office being under the
charge of Mr. James A, Dick in the present Muni-
cipal Council Chambers; if such was the case it must
have been only a temporary arrangement pending
the erection of the Government building at the corner
of George Street and what was formerly known as
??Hangman?s Row,? or in later times as Fitzgerald
Street. ?? I well remember the telegraphic office under
Mr. Ambrose Dischachatti in the present Council
Chambers,? wrote the late John Tebbutt, astronomer,
?for at the request of the Rev. W. Scott, the Govern-
ment Astronomer at that time (1861 or 1862), I
taught the former how to read the meteorological
instruments with which the Government had fur-
nished the office. ? ? But my memory with regard to
the Council Chambers really carries me back to the
period when they were the lodging-place of inebriates
and other unfortunate breakers of the law. The
Council Chambers were then always known as a
?Watch-house,? the term ?lockup? being of later
origin. I remember Mr. Cambridge?s father and
grandfather, but I think there must be some mistake
in a recent allusion to his great grandfather. I have
no recollection whatever of his great grandfather
occupying a position in the local post office. I believe
the grandfather was the first letter-carrier in Wind-
sor. I am not sure if when he started his work he
had a fixed salary, but I think he had not. I know
he was paid a penny a letter by the addressees on the
delivery of the letters. Subsequently this method of
payment ceased and he was paid a regular fixed
salary.?l9lo.
92
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


WINDSOR?S FIRST POSTMAN
(The Late Mr. Thomas Cambridge).
MR. THOMAS CAMBRIDGE, the grandfather of
the present local postman of that name (1910), was
the first letter-carrier in the district. Things were
differently managed in the early days, and instead
of the constitutionally appointed and well-paid officer
of to-day, the first postman was simply a volunteer,
without any fixed pay. The only article the Govern-
ment provided, and this only came in force in later
years, was an unsightly, ill-fitting coat, which can
be seen in the illustration. Thomas Cambridge, the
elder, was a familiar figure in Windsor. He was
eccentric in his habits, and many of his vagaries are
remembered by some of the old hands who survive
him. He commenced his career as a postman in the
?forties,? either under the late Mr. Panton or the
late Mr. Robert Dick, two of our early postmasters.
For something like 20 years he carried out these
duties. His remuneration, when he could get it, was
one penny for letters; newspapers were delivered
free. The postage on letters from Sydney in those
days was sevenpence each. The old man w 7 as a cobbler
by trade. He lived in a little house on the banks
of the South Creek, just below the old toll house.
One of Tom?s perquisites was his Xmas box. On
account of his slight remuneration for letter-carrying
everyone whom he befriended was expected to re-
member him in a substantial way at the festive season.
Tom had a penchant for collecting old iron, and as
he trotted along on foot, wearing his old-fashioned
?bell-topper? with a white band, and his ?swallow-
tail? coat, he would ever and anon stoop and pick
up a horseshoe, a nail, or a piece of old iron, and
pop it into the huge bag in which he carried his
letters. It is said he had always a big collection of
odds and ends in the vicinity of his hut. He died at
93
WINDSOR?S FIRST POSTMAN


the age of 80 years, and was succeeded in the duties
of postman by his son, the father of the present post-
man. This Mr. Cambridge was a properly-appointed
officer, on a fixed salary. Strange to say, three genera-
tions have held the position of local postman, all bear-
ing from the name of Tom. The family has always
been highly respected in the district.
By the way, an old record states that in 1828 the
New South Wales establishment consisted of one
principal postmaster, one clerk, one letter-carrier, and
that post offices had been established at Sydney,
Parramatta, Windsor, Penrith, Liverpool, Campbell-
town, Bathurst, and Newcastle. Mails were conveyed
between Parramatta and Windsor twice a week. In
1830 there is the following entry:? ? ? Bye mails from
Windsor to Pitt Town, Wilberforce, and Richmond
established,? which is not clear as regards the estab-
lishment of post offices at the three last-named places.
In 1844 the old record mentions the establishment of
a post office at Richmond, seemingly for the first time.
The other two offices, Wilberforce and Pitt Town,
would also seem to have come into existence later on
than 1830. In 1838 an overland mail was established
from Windsor, via Wiseman?s Ferry, to Brisbane
Water, once a week. In 1862 the number of inland
mail robberies had increased to an alarming extent,
and they were not confined to one part of the colony,
armed ruffians on the mail road having become a
menace to the community. In 1844, additional mails
were afforded to Richmond six times per week instead
of thrice. Additional mails were ?laid on? in 1851,
including McDonald River. Next year McDonald
River line was made to run to Bundarra instead of
to Walcha.
94
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


AN OLD RIVER TRADER.
IT is not given to many to pass the end of their lives
close to the place where their life work has been
carried on, but such was the case with Captain George
Manning, who died at Sackville, Hawkesbury River.
His home was the farmhouse originally built by Mr.
George Loder, one of the pioneers of farming on the
fertile river when it*, was the granary for the infant
colony. Captain Manning had just reached his 96th
year at the time of his death, and two years before,
when the writer visited him, had a vivid remem-
brance of the river from the days of very early
sailing vessels there. He remembered the boat build-
ing that made the river a busy place, and the forests
of cedar that the sawyers felled and floated down the
numerous creeks and rivers. Although before his
time, he could speak of such early men as Griffiths,
the boat-builder, whose Bee took Governor Bligh on
his many expeditions to the Green Hills, as Windsor
was then called.
?Boat and ship building formed a most important
river industry in my early days,? said Captain
Manning. ?Beazley?s Wharf, between Richmond
and Windsor, was still busy, though the building of
the Mary and Elizabeth and the Governor Bourke was
before my time The Glory was the last of Griffiths?
boats, built about 1819, and the Francis and the
Norfolk were still talked of.?
Captain Manning?s sailing vessel, so many years the
favourite passenger and cargo boat of the Hawkes-
bury, was the Maid of Australia , ?but I suppose,?
said the ex-master, ?most of those who travelled by
her have joined the great majority, for few live to
bear the weight of over 90 years. The Loders, Halls,
Churchills, Doyles, Parnells, Bowmans, and many
other men who first lived at Hawkesbury, though now
their names are known throughout the land, were my
95


passengers, and gladly paid 12/6 for a trip from
Sydney to Windsor in the Maid. Many a little girl,
now, a middle-aged woman, has been put under my
care for her first trip to the big city, as it was then
looked on as quite an adventure for young people
to go so far from home as from the river to Sydney. ? ?
Captain Manning was long the only survivor of the
band of river shipmasters who all rest in the grave-
yards along the banks of the Hawkesbury; Captains
Grono, Herd, Christie, Sternback, Books, and his
partner, Mitchell, being his contemporaries. Among
his passengers was the one-time king of the river, old
Solomon Wiseman.
?I knew him well,? said the captain. ?He was
providore for the convicts, and made many thousands
out of the job. A rough-mannered man, but very
hospitable, and hand-in-glove with the Government.
The judges on circuit ?especially Judge Roger Therry
?used to stay with him in his old house (now an
hotel at the ferry), in the days of overlanding, when
they travelled on horseback that way between Sydney
and Maitland.?
Captain Manning was not actually born on the river,
having come out from England when a child in the
very early emigration days. After steamers were
introduced on to the river as passenger carriers, he
continued to command a vessel; and. was, for over
50 years, until his retirement into private life on his
farm, constantly engaged in the Hawkesbury River
traffic. Even to the last he showed traces of what a
fine personage physically he was, being fully 6 feet
high, and a broad, well-built figure. His daughters,
who have lived all their lives in the district, tended
him in his declining years, and carried on the work
of the farm when he ceased to be able to do so.
96
THOSE WERE THE DAYS




WINDSOR IN 1813.


JOHNNY HIGGERSON.
THE above name, when mentioned to those who knew
him, will never fail to give pleasure or evoke a kindly
word. Although he had long passed the allotted span,
and his race, under the laws of Nature, must have
been nearly run, one cannot but feel grieved at the
sad accident which ended his career.
Much has been said and written since the death of
the old veteran, but perhaps a little more from the
pen of one who knew him personally for over half
a century may be of interest, since his death recalls
to memory many incidents of his life, more especially
that portion of it which is connected with his calling
on the turf.
It was in March, 1890, when I last met him. I was
at National Park, and he, having heard that I was
there, came over for the express purpose of having a
chat and to learn from me what he could of his many
friends of the old Hawkesbury. For, although he
was not born there, he spent many years of his early
life in the district, and was always pleased to meet
old friends and speak of times gone by.
On this particular occasion he was mounted on an
old flea-bitten grey charger, of which he seemed very
proud, for upon my remarking that he looked a good
old sort, he became quite enthusiastic over him, giving
me his pedigree and what he was capable of doing.
And the way the old man dismounted and remounted
again, no one would have thought that he was then
(as he informed me at the time) in his eightieth year.
That, as I stated, was in 1890, which made him 95
at the time of his death. And, again, we are informed
by the Sydney papers he was in his 55th year when
he won the Champion Stakes on Tarragon. Now, as
that particular race was run in 1866, it would leave
the old man 94 years of age at the time of his death?
a difference of one year, which is not worth whhile
entering into a controversy over.
D
97


As for being the oldest native then alive, I think
it would be a tight race between him. and old Billy
Timmins, of Yarramundi, who was still alive (in 1905)
at the age of 95.
I remember the names of many old riders of those
days. There was Johnny Hughes, who first had
charge of Veno; Old Johnny Dunn, an old bully, who
would strike terror into the hearts of the youngsters
pitted against him. The starters, too, he would also
bully. Then there was Johnny Cutts, Johnny Dris-
coll, Micky O?Brien, Billy Phipps, and Jack Maguire
?the latter two North Richmond boys. The late Alex.
Benson used to say Maguire was the best and most
fearless rider in Australia. I saw him riding one
day, when the bit broke in the horse?s mouth. But
he kept his seat, and before the horse had gone half-
a-mile he had him choked down by encircling the
bridle rein round his throat. Mr. Benson, too, I also
saw mounted on Donizette on the old Windsor course.
But to return to Johnny Higgerson.
To enumerate all his mounts during his 40 years
in the saddle would be tedious both for the writer
and the reader, since his wins alone would fill a
volume. I may mention that in addition to those I
have seen in the Sydney and local papers, he rode
the famous old racehorse Jorrocks at both Homebush
and Parramatta in 1843. Whether that was before
or after his mount on Bessie Bedlam, I am not in a
position to say, for he gives no date.
In the same year I notice that Jorrocks ran at
Penrith, under the ownership of Higgerson.
In the 50?s we saw him mounted on Mr. Skuthorp?s
Yeno. It was from that date I became more inti-
mately acquainted with him. Of course, he was known
to every lad at school, for there was nothing so
popular amongst the boys as horseracing. Other games
would come and go, but horseracing was always ?in.?
We had our racecourse and hurdles, and the fastest
98
THOSE WERE THE DAYS


ped. amongst us would be named after the fastest
horse of the day. Jorrocks, Cooramin, Sampson, and
Plover were among the favourite names, Higgerson
being our favourite jockey.
It was on the day that he came to Kurrajong to
take the horse Veno to his new owner or lessee, Mr.
Rowe, that I first had the privilege of speaking to
Mr. Higgerson, and I can assure you I thought it
a very great honour indeed, dor I was only a lad,
and he was the renowned jockey, Johnny Higgerson.
But on more intimate acquaintance in after years, I
discovered that that was one of his characteristics.
He was affable and courteous to all, a trait which he
bore to the end.
One incident in connection with his racing career,
which has been related to me by a friend in w r hom
I can place implicit reliance, may be repeated. It
happened on the old Windsor racecourse, and on the
eve of a great event. Higgerson had the favourite
mount, when some person placed in his hand a sum
of �SO, with a vague intimation that he was to lose
the race. Well, he ran, and he won, and after being
weighed in, he drew the money out of his pocket and
exhibited it to the crowd, stating the purpose for
which it had been given him, and invited the person
who gave it, who ever he may be, to come and claim
it. Needless to say, it was not claimed, and Higgerson
returned it to his pocket again. It was also currently
reported that when he went over to Melbourne with
Veno to race Mr. Chirnside?s mare, Alice Hawthorn,
he was offered �IOOO to lose, and refused. It might
well be said of him ?that the owner who secured the
services of such a man was considered to have a
decided advantage. "
We will now' pass over ten years or so of his life,
although in the interim we can hear of him in his
various successes, when he rode Single?s Ben Bolt,
and beat Yorke?s Lauristina with Dick Snell up; and
99
JOHNNY HIGGERSON


Rowe?s Gratis, when he beat Obie?s Chevalier with
Johnny Cutts up.
It was some time in the 60?s that he became one
of ourselves again. That was when he took charge
of that famous old champion Tarragon, and won the
Champion Oaks in 1866. After running a dead heat
with Volunteer, he won the second heat easily. He
also won other great races, of which I have no record.
But should there be anyone who washes to know of
his many exploits, Harry Ford, or any other old
Richmond boy, will be pleased to comply. They are
all well posted up in Tarragon?s career, as well as
that of his jockey, Higgerson.
One incident in Johnny Higgerson?s life, which
must have caused him some mental anguish, w r as when
he took Tarragon over to South Australia. Mr. Hol-
land, an old Hawkesburyite, but then living in
Adelaide, arranged with Mr. Town to send the horse
over to take part in the Adelaide races, Johnny
Higgerson to take charge. But he was beaten in the
principal race by a mare, I think, named Cowra. For
this failure Higgerson w r as very much blamed?-a
usual thing, of course. The backers of the favourite
must blame somebody when he loses. It takes some
of the edge off, and the unfortunate jockey has no
friends.
With respect to Mr. Higgerson?s early private life
lam not much acquainted. I can just remember his
first wife, and that is all. I have been informed, how-
ever, that her maiden name was Ellen Dean, and that
she was a niece of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Smith, whom
we have heard so much of in connection with horse-
racing in the early days at Clifton, and from which
place Miss Dean married. And a curious coin-
cidence. The second Mrs. Higgerson was also Ellen
Dean, and was married from the residence of her
aunt, Mrs. Alfred Smith, the Racecourse Hotel. The
former Dean family, it may be said, was in no w T ay
connected with the latter.

THOSE WERE THE DAYS


DR. MARTIN MASON.
IN the Centenary History of the Sydney Hospital
lately published by Dr. J. Frederick Watson, some
interesting facts have been unearthed, and one item
particularly interesting to Windsor is mentioned when
he says that the first private medical practitioner in
Australia was Dr. Martin Mason, who in 1804 estab-
lished himself at the Hawkesbury, after serving three
years as acting Assistant Surgeon of the Colony.
Many old-time Hawkesbury folk will like to hear
about one of the most prominent citizens of Windsor
of the long ago, for during the stirring times of the
first decade of last century Dr. Martin Mason suffered
much in peforming what he thought to be a public
duty, and was selected by the settlers of the Hawkes-
bury to represtn them even in England, whither he
and George Suttor (the head of the Bathurst Suttors)
went as delegates of settlers to give evidence for
Governor Bligh at Major Johnston?s trial, and their
expenses were paid by public subscription.
Dr. Martin Mason arrived first in New South Wales
on the 18th July, 1798, as surgeon to the Britannia ,
a famous old transport of the early colonial days.
On that particular trip she brought out female con-
victs, and Judge Advocate Collins in his History thus
speaks of her arrival? On the 18th arrived the
Britannia whaler from England with 94 female con-
victs. The cattle that came in the Hunter, and which
were sold by auction about the same time, were not
greater objects of contest than were these ladies, the
number of women in the settlements bearing no?pro-
portion to the men.?
. After her arrival here the Britannia was employed
in the local whaling industry, and Dr. Mason was
out of a job, but he evidently was in the good graces
of the Governor, John Hunter, who appointed him
surgeon on board the H.M.S. Buffalo, then on this
station, and he remained in that position til] that


vessel was ordered to England in September, 1800.
He had decided to remain in the colony, and Hunter,
in a despatch dated July 28, 1799, to Under-Secretary
King, says:?? Mr. Mason, who is now surgeon on the
Buffalo, and who is so attached to this country that
he proposes to continue in it, if he can have the favour
of a passage hither of his wife and three children,
should she apply to you, it will be doing a kindness
to a deserving man, and no doubt a service to the
Colony, if you will have the goodness to order a
passage for her in any ship coming here.?
On the Ist October, 1800, Governor King appointed
Mason assistant colonial surgeon, and on the 6th
January, 1801, he was appointed to act as magistrate
for the districts of Parramatta and Toongabbie, and
we have it that in June, 1801, he was allowed three
convicts to work for him,. Shortly afterwards he was
appointed to the management of the Settlement at
the Hunter River, now Newcastle, where, amongst
other duties, he had charge of the coalmine for the
Government. Some of his reports to Governor King
make interesting reading nowadays. However, on the
31st December, 1803, the British Government sent out
Mr. John Savage to act as surgeon in place of Dr.
Mason, who at once went to the Hawkesbury and com-
menced private practice at the Green Hills, now known
as Windsor.
No doubt Dr, Martin Mason would have lived and
died the quiet humdrum life of the country medical
practitioner, but for becoming involved in the stirring
times of 1808. On the 26th of January of that year,
Major Johnston, the senior military officer of the
colony, arrested Governor William Bligh, and the
Hawkesbury settlers took sides with the deposed
Governor and stuck to him through thick and thin,
and at their head was the worthy doctor, and he
became a marked man, with Mr. George Suttor. Both
of them were imprisoned for not obeying the military


officers who took charge of the colony. They objected
and denied the right of people they called rebels. He
was also charged with having an illicit still on his
premises, which was seized and destroyed, although
Lieutenant Governor Foveaux did not imprison him.
On page 129 of the Trial of Colonel Johnston, Mason
explained the circumstances under which this still was
found on his premises. He denied that it was found
at work. He stated it was only a small one made out
of a tin kettle. No attempt had been made to conceal
it, as it was only used by him for professional pur-
poses (he was practising as a surgeon) and it was
known to be in his possession by Dr. Arndell (the
Resident Magistrate) and the Chief Constable of the
district, to both of whom he had reported it. It was
used openly in the kitchen. Mason?s whole evidence
went to show that he had been subject to persecution
in this matter, because he had openly sympathised
with Governor Bligh, and had repeatedly refused to
sign the address to Johnston. He denied he had ever
been dismissed from the public service for miscon-
duct, as alleged. His statements evidently impressed
the members of the Court favourably, and' no attempt
was made on behalf of the defence to rebut or impugn
them.
When it was that the trial of Johnston
should take place in England, the sympathisers w r ith
Bligh selected George Suttor and Martin Mason as
their representatives to go to England and give
evidence for Bligh, and their expenses were found by
public subscription. The English Governmnt also
allowed Dr. Mason fifteen shillings a day subsistence
while in England on the trial, and they provided him
with a passage back in August, 1811, in the ship Mary.
From that date I have lost all trace of him. Whether
he remained in England or not I cannot find out, In
August, 1811, he was pressing the English Govern-
ment for money to compensate him for his loss of


practice, and the imprisonment by the Military be-
cause of his loyalty, but no record has been found
of what was done in his case. He asked for a Govern-
ment appointment and a grant of land for his ser-
vices, so it looked as if he intended to return to his
family and reside in the colony. In 1811 he had a
family of five children, and perhaps some representa-
tives of his family may yet be found on Australian
soil.
?A GOVERNOR?S PRIMITIVE HOUSE.?
?The Windsor of New South Wales.?
THE above were the headlines to an article on Old
Government House, Windsor, which appeared in The
Sphere, a well-known London illustrated paper, of
April 71, 1909, accompanied by an excellent photo-
graph of the building, taken evidently fom the comer
of Mr. J. J. Paine?s property. The letterpress is
interesting and is here given in full: ?
The presentment of an old Government House in which
several of the early Governors (?) of Australia have lived
in the days when there was only one settlement?that of
N.S.W., was first built for Governor Bligh, about 1807, and,
as the picture shows, is almost entirely of wood. It has
been renovated many times, but is now almost in decay, and
is lived in by the village shoemaker. Captain William
Bligh (who was deposed by the New South Wales Corps,
on account of the strict measures over the liquor trade in
the days when rum was currency) tried to reach Govern-
ment House, Windsor, where he thought he could gather
round him an army among the settlers, and defy the
military, who were for the only time in Australian history,
usurping civil rule. However, the recall of Governor Bligh
prevented this; but the people round the Hawkesbury, of
which Windsor is the chief town, still hold Captain Bligh?s
name in grateful memory. His successor in office, Major-
General Lachlan Macquarie, resided in the now ruined
cottage for several months out of every year, and ad-
ministered the affairs of the chief penal station out of
Sydney from offices in the building. Here was held the
banquet where for the first time an emancipist sat at
dinner with a Governor of the country to which he had


been sent out, together with the officials under whose charge
he had been placed as a convict.
The Emancipist referred to above, though the name
is not given in The Sphere?s article, was Andrew
Thompson, whose neglected grave in St. Matthew?s
Church of England cemetery calls loudly for atten-
tion at the hands of all who have any regard for
the story and career of a good man and true. Coming
to the country a common convict, he so comported
himself as to ultimately become Chief Constable, a
trusted official, a citizen of high repute, the personal
friend of Macquarie; and at the end he sacrificed his
life in the interests of the farmers of the district,
for it was whilst he was engaged in helping to save
their lives and property during a disastrous flood,
that he contracted the illness to which he subsequently
succumbed. If ever a man in Australia earned the
honour of a public monument, that man was Andrew
Thompson?yet his resting-place is a disgrace to the
district and a blot upon its traditional generosity.
Hawkesbury folk should regard it as a tribute to
the interest which attaches to the old town and its
surroundings that so eminent a publication as The
Sphere should devote space to a matter affecting a
centre so far away from the real scope of its opera-
tion ; it should incite them to take steps to preserve
the historical landmarks of which Windsor and its
district are possessed. When in a country enjoying
such hallowed associations as does Great Britain, every
effort is made to protect and retain all buildings of
historical importance and all objects of value and
interest to the searcher after national antiquities, how
much more so should this feeling animate the people
of a new country like our own, whose history has
been one of hardships and reverses, and whose ex-
periences in all the various walks of life, like Crabbe?s
poems, ?Are rough truths scratched with a tenpenny
nail on a whitewashed wall ?" Perhaps the mere pub-
lication in a London paper of the article I have quoted


will move them to take some steps in the matter above
referred to.
Yet there are errors in the quotation from The
Sphere , and of them Mr. W. Freame, a well-known
contributor on early historical matters, wrote:
?First, the so-called Old Government House, Windsor,
was not a residence of the early Governors. Secondly, it was
not built for Governor Bligh about 1807. As a matter of
fact, it was built during Governor Hunter?s time as a
residence for the local commandant with office and depot for
public uses; and is included in a ?Return of Public Build-
ings erected in N. S. Wales since 1796,?the said return
being signed by Governor Hunter. As Governor Hunter
completed his term of office during 1800, being succeeded by
Governor King, it is plainly seen that the old building?
which is the oldest (known) building in Australia ?could
not have been erected for Governor Bligh, who arrived in
1806. In making this explanation Ido not desire to detract
one iota from Mr. Fitzpatrick?s ability as the Windsor
historian, for, as a matter of fact, a similar explanation
may be found in his splendid work, ?The Good Old Days.?
But misleading statements, even if they have escaped Mr.
Fitzpatrick?s notice, should not be allowed to pass as his-
torical truths. I must also take exception to the state-
ments that ?Governor Macquarie resided in the cottage for
several months out of every year, and administered the
affairs of the chief penal station out of Sydney from offices
in the building.? Governor Macquarie, it is quite true,
frequently visited Windsor, but he lived most of his time in
Parramatta.
It is also incorrect to say that ?Here was held the ban-
quet where for the first time an emancipist sat at dinner
with a Governor.? This especial mark of favour bestowed
upon Andrew Thompson, took place either in Government
House, Sydney, or possibly Government House, Parramatta
?certainly not in Windsor. This action of Macquarie?s
called forth the indignation of Chief Chaplain Marsden,
who protested at being expected to met at the Governor?s
table an ex-convict and a publican. I quite agree with Mr.
Fitzpatrick that Thompson?s neglected grave is a disgrace
and trust that something may yet be done to preserve it
from utter ruin. But I am fully persuaded that Andrew
Thompson was not altogether the amiable character some
of his admirers would have us believe he was. We know
he rendered heroic service during the big flood of 1806, and
we remember that circumstance as being most creditable


to him. If Mr. Fitzpatrick will look up ?The Sydney Gaz-
ette' of the 11th of May, 1806', he will see that Thompson
was allowed to purchase brewing utensils from the Govern-
ment stores, at an advance of fifty per cent, on invoice
price, with the privilege of brewing beer, in consideration of
his humane conduct in saving life and property during the
floods on the Hawkesbury. Macquarie made him a magis-
trate, despite the remonstrances of the free inhabitants,
and the officers of the 73rd Regiment; and the sight of an
ex-prisoner and rum seller, riding in his carriage through
Sydney to dine with the Governor was hardly beneficial as
a restraint upon incipient pick pockets and rick burners.
But Thompson was an opportunist. He knew on which
side his bread was buttered. He kept ?sweet? while working
at his trade in Parramatta; he looked after Bligh?s interest
at Green Hills, and he became Macquarie?s man ?Friday?;
and in every instance Thompson prospered. He made a
clear �l5OO from an outlay of �l5O in one year out of rum.
And it has been said, with how much truth I cannot say,
that with the assistance of Solomon Wiseman, he smuggled
a great deal of his rum up the Hawkesbury. Thompson
was a great money-maker, a bold, fearless, determined
plodder, a born capitalist, who seized every chance to make
money ?and that is about all we can say of him. He made
money?honestly, let us hope ?but he made it; hence his
success.?
[Note. ?Needless to say, I don?t by any means endorse
the sentiments of Mr. Freame regarding Thompson.?

THE HAWKESBURY AGRICULTURAL
ASSOCIATION.
THE following particulars respecting the establish-
ment of the Hawkesbury Agricultural Association are
gleaned from the minute-book kept at the time: ?
?At a meeting of the Committee of the above
Association, held at Coffey?s hotel, Windsor, on
Monday,'the 14th July, 1845, pursuant to public
notice, Robert Fitzgerald, Esq., in the chair, it was
resolved that the following prizes should be given
at the Ploughing Match and Show of Stock and
Agricultural Produce to take place on Thursday, the
4th September next, at Windsor.?
Then follows the schedule, containing about 34


classes, and split up into five sections ?ploughing,
show of cattle, produce, agricultural implements, and
agricultural servants. Note the last-named!
It is rather a contrast to the Hawkesbury District
Agricultural Association?s schedule for the Show of
1904, which had a record of 3,000 entries.
I can remember the Show in 1845. I was 16 years
of age at the time. It was held at Clarendon, on
the old property originally owned by Captain Cox
(father of William Cox), and later on by Charles
Clarendon Cox, who established the flour mill there.
Between those times it was occupied by John Seath,
Charles Hughes, and George Douglass. Subsequently
it came into the possession" of Arthur Dight.
In the ancient schedule before me are two classes
for ploughing. One reads: ?
??The Association?s silver medal, to be ploughed
for by the sons of farmers; the plough drawn by a
pair of horses, and driven with reins.? That event
was won by a very smart native, Billy Williams, who
was also a great reaper in those days?the crack of
the district. He could reap his acre a day. Matthew
Nowland w r as second.
The other class reads: ?
?A prize of �3, with the Association?s silver medal,
to be ploughed for by youths under eighteen years
of age, the plough drawn by a pair of horses, and
driven with reins.? This event was won by a son
of the late Ed. Powell, of Richmond. Peter Carroll,
of Windsor, was second.
For the ?Agricultural Servants? section, a prize
of �2 ?for the servant who has been longest in the
hired service of one master,? was won by James
Bockarty, of Percy Place, Pitt Town.
The following were named as having been requested
to act as judges:?
J. Yeomans, G. M. Pitt, Joseph Pye, Thomas
Tebbutt, S. Tuekerman, Arthur Dight, J. Hoskis-
son, James Hale, James G. Doyle, J. Macdonald,


John Single (of Penrith), Thomas Parnell, Thomas
Arndell, John Teale, Laban White, William John-
stone, John Wood, J. J. Vi very, John F. Doyle,
John O?Dell, Michael McQuade, James Prendergast,
Edmund Burke, Richard Ridge, William White, John
Dunstan, Edward Robinson, and James Rochester.
The schedule concludes as follows:
?Mr. Richard Sheriff is authorised to receive sub-
scribers? names and subscription moneys in aid of the
funds of the Association. ?F. Beddek, Honorary
Secretary, ? ?
Mr. Beddek was the solicitor with whom Hon.
William Walker, M.L.C., served his articles.
I forget how long the Association lived. The torn-
out leaves from the ancient minute-book could have
told the tale, but evidently they were destroyed.
Flipping over the leaves I came across a newspaper
clipping, as follows: ?-
Moved by Dr. Stewart and seconded by Mr. John O?Dell,
7. That the following gentlemen be requested to act as
Treasurer and Secretary, pro tem.:?
A. G. PANTON, Esq., Treasurer.
FRANCIS BEDDEK, Esq., Secretary.
R. FITZGERALD, Esq.
The chair having been vacated by Mr. Fitzgerald, and
Captain O?Connell having been called there,
It was moved by F. Beddek, Esq., and seconded by R. C.
Lethbridge, Esq., that the thanks of this Meeting be given
to R. Fitzgerald, Esq., for his able conduct of the Chair.
M. C. O?CONNELL.
Subscription Lists are now lying at Windsor, at the
offices of Mr. Beddek; the stores of Messrs. Betts and
Panton; Robinson?s Plough Inn; and Blanchard?s White
Hart Inn. At Richmond, at the residence of Mr. William
Town, and at the stores of Mr. Brew. At Wilber force, at
Mr. Vickery?s. At Sackville Reach, Mr. Tuckerman?s. And
at Pitt Town, Mr. Macdonald?s and Mr. Thomas Arndell?s.
This no doubt is a portion of the newspaper report
of the meeting at which the first Association was
formed.


I also came across a slip of manuscript, evidently
the secretary?s handwriting, worded as follows; ?
?Windsor, August 12th, 1848. At a meeting of the fol-
lowing persons held this day at T. Byrne?s ?White Hart? Inn,
Members of Committee to the Hawkesbury Agricultural
Association, it was the opinion of the majority present
that the late special general meeting was irregular, inas-
much as such a meeting had no power, called as it was to
determine the place for holding the ensuing show meeting,
to alter the resolution of the Committee without a general
meeting having first altered the standing rules of the
Association, which empower the Committee alone to decide
upon the place of meeting.?
The Present Association.
I don?t know how long the old Association lived,
but according to a clipping from the Hawkesbury
Herald, the present Association has been in existence
continuously since 1879. It was formed on the motion
of (then) Major Holborow, Mayor of Richmond, and
the late Thomas Primrose, Mayor of Windsor, Other
movers of resolutions were Messrs. W. Gosper, R.
H. Dueker, F. J. Gow, C. J. Pitt, B. Conlan, Jas,
Farlow, Captain Linsley, and W. M. Lackey.
The first president w 7 as Andrew Town, and the first
year 273 members were enrolled.
WINDSOR?S FIRST HOTEL.
THE many and various hotels of Windsor have from
time to time been the theme for many facile pens,
and as some of the best stories of the good old days
of the Hawkesbury centre round one or other of
these famous houses, I have searched the records to
see if I could find the first Windsor hotel.
I found in the Sydney Gazettes for the month of
July, 1815, an advertisement signed by one Thomas
Hanson, informing the public generally and the
people of the Hawkesbury particularly, that he had
been engaged by the proprietor (whose name is not
mentioned) to open those commodious premises in


Windsor to be known as the ?Macquarie Arms,? on
and after the 31st of July then instant. He said that
by his experience as a publican in England, and his
attention and civility, he hoped to merit a business
much needed in Windsor.
In the Gazette of the 29th July, 1815, I find the
following interesting account of the opening of the
pub : ? "That spacious and commodious new Inn at
Windsor, called the ?Macquarie Arms,? was opened
by the Governor on Wednesday, the 26th instant,
when His Excellency entertained at dinner the
Magistrates and other principal gentlemen residing at
Windsor, and in that neighbourhood. Mr. Ranson,
who has taken on himself the duties of Innkeeper, is,
from his experience in the vocation, thoroughly com-
petent to the undertaking which we are convinced will
be conducted upon a liberal footing. Its necessity
has been long manifest, as there was no house of
public reception at Windsor capable of accommodat-
ing large and genteel companies; whereas the ?Mac-
quarie Arms,? from its extent, plan of buildings, and
adequate number of apartments, will be doubtless
found worthy of the most liberal patronage and
support. ? ?
It seems clear from the context of the above notice
that the ?Macquarie Arms? was the first pub in
Windsor, although it does not follow that Mr. Ranson
was the first licensed seller of liquor. In the early
days it was the man who was licensed, and not the
house, and it was Governor Macquarie who brought
about the reform and licensed the house, and required
a name to be attached to each house.
The next question to decide, and perhaps a more
difficult one, is where stood the ?Macquarie Arms??
It is, at any rate, believed that the ?Macquarie Arms?
was the name first given to the present ?Royal
Hotel,? and the name of the proprietor not disclosed
in Mr. Ranson?s advertisement was Mr. Richard Fitz-
gerald, who was at that time the principal super


intendent of convicts and Government public works
at the Hawkesbury. One is led to believe this by
reason of a report made to the British House of
Commons by a Royal Commissioner, John Thomas
Bigge, who was sent out to enquire into the working
of the Settlement in New South Wales. Mr. Bigge
arrived in Sydney 25th September, 1819, and left on
14th February, 1821, after visiting all portions of
the Settlement. In reporting on the Hawkesbury,
Mr. Bigge was surprised to find that the Chief Super-
intendent, Richard Fitzgerald, was practically run-
ning the principal hotel at Windsor, for although the
license was not in his name, it was well known that
he owned it, and he resided next door to the hotel,
in what is still known as ?The Cottage.? We know
that Mr. Fitzgerald?s hotel was leased on 27th January,
1835, to the Government for five years for a mess
house for the officers of the 50th Regiment, and
perhaps some of the oldest residents could therefore
fell if the old name of the hotel was the ?Macquarie
Arms.? If this is so, it is particularly interesting
to know that the Royal Hotel celebrated its centenary
in 1915.
WINDSOR IN THE ?SIXTIES.
[Sydney Morning Herald? August 22, 1862.]
FOOT RACE. ?A pedestrian match between the two
well-known runners, Harry Williams of Windsor, and
Turd of Wolombi, took place on Monday last, over
a piece of ground at the rear of Norris? Plough Inn,
Richmond Road. The distance run was one hundred
and twenty-five yards, and the amount of the stakes
was �IOO. A great amount of excitement prevailed up
to the time of starting, and many hundreds of pounds
changed hands in _ betting. To show the interest
?which was evinced in the tryst, a number of female
equestriennes, who had ridden from the M?Donald
and the Hawkesbury, a distance of some fifty mile*,


were on the ground to lend their influence to their
favourite, Jurd. On the whole, there were not fewer
than a thousand spectators. Both men w r ere freely
backed?Williams, however, having a little advance.
Having tossed for sides, and Jurd winning, he elected
to run on the right side; Williams winning the toss
for ends, he decided upon running down the slight
declivity. On coming to the scratch, both men dis-
played great physical power, Jurd being somewhat
taller than Williams, looking remarkably well. Wil-
liams, however, looked, as he usually does upon such
occasions, a perfect model; and, from his great de-
velopment of muscle, it was evident immense care
had been taken in his training. The officers necessary
upon such occasions having been elected, the start
was effected. Williams went away with the lead,
which he maintained, after a severe struggle on the
part of Jurd, to the end, coming in a winner by about
a yard, amidst the cheers of his very numerous friends.
We have on a former occasion referred to the fine
style of Williams? running, and need not say further
now than that he maintained his character in that
respect. Of Jurd, we cannot say so much in his
favour as to his style, he being, to our mind, rather
loose; but he is unquestionably a dangerous antago-
nist. The time, as near as it was possible to be taken,
in which the race was run was fifteen seconds, but
it is impossible to speak positively to a second or
two. Consequent upon the above race, another match
was made upon the ground between Jurd?s trainer,
Paddy Henry, a well-known runner in Maitland, and
Joe Bushell, of Wilberforce, for �lO, a distance of
fifty yards. It was evident Bushell had over-esti-
mated his racing qualifications in this instance at
least, if we may judge from the easy manner in which
Henry won.
Taking Toll from a Volunteer. ?Margaret Rafter,
lessee of the Fitzroy Bridge, was summoned to the
police office, and appeared on Tuesday last to answer


the complaint of Benjamin Mawson, sergeant of the
Hawkesbury Volunteers, for demanding and taking
toll from him whilst returning from exercise, he being
in the uniform of the corps. It seemed the complain-
ant was in a gig with Mr. S. M. Pitt, returning from
ball-practice, and according to his evidence sixpence
was demanded at the toll-gate and paid for for the
?horse and gig.? Mr. Walker appeared for the
defendant, and submitted that under the Volunteer
Act it was not contemplated that members should
travel, whilst on duty, in gigs. Besides, the Act
stated no penalty. Mr. Powell, J.P., the sitting
justice, concurred, and dismissed the complaint.
RICHMOND METHODIST CHURCH.
REV. A. S. SWIFT, who was at one time located at
Windsor, received from Mr. E. Campbell, of Rich-
mond, a copy of the long defunct Sydney Gazette,
from which the following record is transcribed. It
should be of considerable interest to a number of
people, not only of old identities, but of the younger
generations, especially Methodists, in the Hawkesbury
district. Worthy to be held in grateful remembrance
are the good men of long ago, whose names figure
on the subscription list, many of whose sons and
daughters are no doubt scattered far and wide over
New South Wales, and who in their turn are in some
way helping to sustain the cause of religion, which
makes for righteousness and for the well-being of the
people of the land; ?
From the ?Sydney Gazette and N.S.W. Advertiser? of
Monday, 12th November, 1827: ?
To the Editor of the ?Sydney Gazette.?
Sir, ?For many years have the Wesleyan missionaries
regularly performed divine service at Richmond. For a
long time they were kindly accommodated with the use of
the Government school house, but as its situation is very in-
convenient, they afterwards met their congregation in a


private house. They at length resolved to build a chapel.
A good piece of ground in the central part of the town was
obtained, and the first stone laid on the 24th July last by
the Rev. George Erskine, who preached a very appropriate
sermon on the occasion from Christ?s words to Martha,
?One thing is needful.? This neat little structure has
lately been finished; it is built of brick, and capable of
accommodating 70 or 80 persons. It was opened for divine
worship on Tuesday, the 30th ultimo, on which occasion
the Rev. Samuel Leigh, from Parramatta, preached to a
large and respectable audience in the morning, and the Rev.
George Erskine, from Windsor, in the evening. The texts
were taken from John xvii. 3, and I Samuel xii. 24. The
sermons were appropriative, impressive and edifying. The
collections amounted to �lO 15s. lOd. The morning service
was rendered particularly interesting by the baptism of
three young .women, the daughters of an old and respect-
able settler in the neighbourhood. Now, sir, as you are
known to be a zealous advocate for every undertaking cal-
culated to ?Advance Australia,? if you will have the good-
ness to insert this statement, and the subjoined list of
subscriptions in your paper gratis, we shall feel ourselves
greatly obliged to you. And may I be allowed to add that
our obligations will be much increased by your adding your
own name for a pound or two. The truth is, sir, that not-
withstanding the noble liberality of our friends in this
part, we are a little in debt, and are compelled to appeal
to our opulent friends in Sydney for their assistance.
* Yours truly,
John Harper.

PLACE-NAMES OF THE DISTRICT.
FROM a lecture delivered by Mr. James Jarvie
before the Parramatta and District Historical Society
we take the, following interesting information relating
to the origin of the names of the various centres of
this district:?
Quaker?s Hill.
This name dates back to the early years of the last
century. An issue of the Sydney Gazette for 1821
refers to the Quaker?s Hill Ponds. The origin of
the name is, however, somewhat obscure. The railway
station now known as Quaker?s Hill was originally
Douglas? Siding.
Schofield?s.
John Schofield was one of the early settlers in the
vicinity of this siding, hence the name.
Riverstone.
Riverstone was the name of a grant made by
Governor Macquarie to Colonel O?Connell, of the
73rd Regiment, on the eve of his marriage (8th May,
1810) to Mrs. Mary Putland, widow of Lieutenant
John Putland and daughter of Governor Bligh. The
land was bounded by the Hawkesbury Road, and
adjoined the ?Copenhagen? grant belonging to


Governor King. The grant comprised an area of
2,500 acres, and O?Connell named it Riverstone. The
spelling varies; some old maps and records give it
as Riverston. Macquarie lived to repent his gene-
rosity. Mrs. 0 ?Connell appears to have been an adept
at the popular pastime of ?setting the world by the
ears. ?' She could not forgive those responsible for
her father?s deposition, and this revengeful spirit
was the cause of much trouble. The Governor even-
tually recommended O?Connell?s removal, together
with his regiment, on the ground that the Lieutenant-
Colonel allowed himself to be influenced by his wife?s
feelings, and that his removal would annihilate party
strife in the colony.
Clarendon.
Clarendon was the name of William Cox?s home-
stead. William Cox was a lieutenant in the 102 nd
Regiment (the N.S.W. Corps). After his arrival here
Cox purchased Brush Farm. At a later date he sold
Brush Farm and took up land near Windsor. This
farm was known as Clarendon. The name was
derived from Clarendon Park, formerly one of the
Royal forests of England. It is situated in Wilt-
shire, about two and a half miles from Salisbury.
Cox?s name is closely linked with the development
of the infant colony of New South Wales, and he
will ever be associated with the road across the Blue
Mountains, for which he was responsible.
South Creek.
The name of South Creek carries one back to the
early days of the colony. It was named probably
during one of the early exploring expeditions. At
one period it was known as Ruse?s Creek. When
James Ruse sold his Experiment Farm to John Harris
he obtained a grant of land at the junction of the
Hawkesbury and the present South Creek, hence the
name Ruse?s Creek. A gazetteer, published in 1866,
also refers to it as ?Wianamatta Creek.?


Bouse Hill.
Rouse Hill perpetuates the name of Richard Rouse,
who received a grant of 450 acres on Bth October,
1816. This grant became known as Rouse Hill,
although the name was not recorded officially. An
earlier grant to Rouse was situated on the northern
side of the Parramatta-Windsor Road, and was known
as Vinegar Hill, The name Rouse Hill would appear
to have superseded Vinegar Hill. In grants subse-
quently issued (after the Rouse Hill grant) Rouse
is referred to as Richard Rouse, of Rouse Hill. It
is said that Governor Macquarie changed the name
Vinegar Hill to Rouse Hill. Rouse died on the 10th
May, 1852, after residing in the colony for 51 years.
A Gazetteer for 1866 refers to a hill on the Parra-
matta-Windsor Road as Vinegar Hill, so it would
appear that the earlier name was retained, unofficially
at least, for many years.
HAWKESBURY RACES.
FROM a local newspaper of the time (1860) the fol-
lowing is taken: ?? ?lt is now about two years since (in
1860) races took place at Windsor, and many pleasing
anticipations were consequently entertained by the
sport-loving inhabitants of the Hawkesbury when it
was announced that the annual subscription races were
to be renewed. To-day the weather was all that could
be desired ?in fact, too fine, if anything. The atten-
dance of spectators, compared with previous occa-
sions, was rather meagre; but still a large number
of the youth and beauty of the Hawkesbury, some
of our M.L.A.?s, and a number of the leading gentry,
appeared on the scene. There was a splendid field
of horses to make up for any other deficiency, and
everything seemed to pass off well. On the ground
there were booths of various sorts in abundance, and
amusements of several kinds for the juveniles. The
stewards are entitled to much credit for the arrange-
ments made. Mr. Benjamin Richards acted as judge.


At one o?clock the bell rung, and the horses started
as follows:-
First Race. ?The Maiden Plate of 75 sovereigns,
with a sweep of 3 sovereigns each added; for all
maiden horses at time of entrance; 1% mile; second
horse to receive �2O from the prize; entrance, 5
sovereigns.

G. Day?s blk g Pelissier, aged
B. Richard?s be Rifle Bird
R. Dine?s b f Eva.
Tarragon went away with the lead, which he main-
tained about three-quarters of a mile, when he was
collared and passed by Pelissier and Volunteer, in
which position they ran for a short distance, when
Tarragon again went to the front, and came in an
easy winner by two lengths. The time was 3%
minutes. Eva bolted after going the first half mile,
but for which mishap it was believed that she should
have won.
Second Race. ?The All-aged Stakes of 60 sovereigns,
with sweep of 5 sovereigns each added; for all horses,
weight for age; twice round and a distance; second
horse to receive 10 sovereigns from the prize; entrance,
�3/10/-.

Shamrock led from the jump, closely followed by
Fairy for about half a mile, when the latter put
on a spurt and passed Shamrock. This position was
only maintained for a very short time, when Fairy
fell back to her former place. At the rise coming
home Ben Bolt made a desperate rush, but it was
too late; he succeeded, however, in gaining second
place, allowing Shamrock to win at his ease. Time,

it was said, to give Ben Bolt a better chance.
Third Race. ?The Squatters? Purse, of 30 sove-
seigns, with a sweep of 3 sovereigns each added; for
all horses that have, never won a prize exceeding �SO

Promised Land led at starting, followed by Dan
O?Connell, with Wild Dayrell hanging on. They had
not proceeded far when Wild Dayrell went up, and
passed the other two, and came in a winner by a
length. Time, 2 minutes 8 seconds.
Fourth Race. ?Free Handicap of 50 sovereigns,
with a sweep of 5 sovereigns; �1 forfeit; for all
horses to be handicapped by the stewards, or whom
they may appoint; one mile and a half; second horse
to receive �lO from the prize; the winner to pay five
per cent, of gross amount to the fund.

Erin-go-Bragh took the lead, Eugenie following,
who soon took Erin?s place, which she maintained
for about half a mile, when the old horse took up
the running, and, passing Eugenie, came in an easy
winner by about three lengths. Time, 3 minutes 17
seconds.


JONATHAN LEET.
ON Monday, March 21, 1921, there passed away
Mr. Jonahan Leet, at his residence, Leet?s Yale,
Hawkesbnry River, aged 92 years. By his death,
the Hawkesbury River has lost its oldest pioneer.
Respected by all who knew him, it will be some
time before the people of the river will cease to
look for his regular attendance at church, or forget
the sturdy old gentleman always ready to go to the
aid of others with practical help and encouragement.
Shortly after making his home at Leet?s Yale he
joined the Wesleyan Methodists, and soon his deep
piety and earnest living were recognised, which soon
led to his becoming a local preacher and class leader.
Local preacher 47 years and class leader 14 years,
he has left an indelible mark upon Methodism on
the Hawkesbury. For 30 years he carried out the
unties of postmaster at Leet?s Vale with admirable
efficiency and tact, and was happily rewarded by the
confidence and esteem of the whole district. In the
early days there were no roads, and it was really
due to the energy of this grand old man that the
Government were approached, and a sum of money
granted for the construction of what was then termed
a bridle track across the hills to the old township
of Windsor.
Jonathan Leet was born near the village of East
Bergholt, Suffolk, England, on the 17th October,
1828, and was the third eldest of a family of eight.
The river Orwell, famed for its beautiful surround-
ings (not unlike the Hawkesbury River at Windsor),
passed within half a mile of his home. The first
years of his life were spent in rural pursuits on
the neighbouring farms, the knowledge thus gained
proving a great help to him when he settled later
in Australia. In 1857 he decided to emigrate, and


with his younger brother, Robert, sailed from Eng-
land on the 26th March, in the sailing ship Glen IsU.
The voyage occupied 14 weeks, and on the 2nd July
they landed at Sydney. Their primary destination
was to an uncle (Mr. Israel Leet), who had settled
at Webb?s Creek, on a farm now known as Mount
Leet. There being no trading boats leaving Sydney
that week for the Hawkesbury, the brothers came up
by train to Parramatta, thence by coach to Windsor,
arriving there about 3 o?clock in the afternoon. After
making known their destination to a friendly resi-
dent, they were directed to Windsor wharf, and
obtained passage in a small trading vessel that was
leaving for down the river in half an hour. The
?voyage? was full of interest to them. The natives
(as the colonials were usually termed in those days)
having a dialect of their own, also ?expressions,?
caused much amusement, as no doubt the ?Eng-
lishers? ? talk seemed queer to the boatmen. Some
time after midnight the travellers arrived at Webb?s
Creek, the journey from Windsor having taken only
nine hours, which was reckoned a quick run. A few
days later Jonathan Leet obtained employment at old
Mr. Robert Lowe?s, of Lower Portland, remaining
there for nine months, during which time Robert
Leet had taken up land at Sackville, near Mr. John
Hall?s. In 1862 he married, and for a time settled
at Webb?s Creek. There being practically no vessels
plying between the river and Sydney, the settlers
took their produce to Windsor, where it was bought
direct out of the boats, the buyers bringing their
own carts to take away whatever was purchased. It
was not long before Jonathan Leet procured a boat
and commenced to run a regular trip once a week
to Windsor, picking up cargo en route. There was
plenty of deep water right up to and beyond Wind-
sor, and trading on the river was carried on inde-
pendent of tides. The boat, capable of carrying a
cargo of 100 tons, proved too small. It was sold and


a larger one bought from Mr. Owen Cavanough. She
was christened The Spitfire, and took part in many
an exciting race to obtain a coveted berth at Windsor
wharf. The big flood of '67, which caused so much
distress and destruction on the Hawkesbury, spoiled
for a time this lucrative river trade, and hearing
that ?Blueuit?s Bight,? a property five miles above
Wiseman?s Ferry, was for sale, he w r ent after it and
finally purchased it. Here at last he settled down
to make his home, not changing the name of the farm
to Beet?s Vale till several years later, and then by
popular local request. After a few more years he
gave up trading to Windsor, and with the late Charles
Gambrill took over the running of a dealing boat
for the late William Dean, of Windsor. About this
time the Laughton Bros., of Laughtondale, began
planting out their first fruit nursery. Ever on the
alert, Jonathan Beet saw the possibilities of fruit-
growing, and finally leaving the boats, soon had a
flourishing nursery of his own, being thus one of
the first to introduce fruit-growing to the Hawkes-
bury. The first big orchardists were the Laughton
Bros., followed closely by John Mitchell, of Upper
Half-moon Farm, Beet?s Vale. The larger orchard,
known as Australian - Farm, and owned by Mr.
Mathew Chaseling, was commenced some time later.
Good prices ruled for fruit in the ?good old days?
of fruit-growing. (Perhaps it was because the agents
could spare more?) Anyhow, 20/- to 35/- per case
was the general return for stone fruit, mostly
peaches. Oranges weren?t usually packed in cases,
but tipped loose, after being counted into the hold
of the ship and afterwards sold by the captain at
the wharf by the dozen. Tomatoes were known
locally as love apples, and grew chiefly uncultivated.


DAN MAYNE and SIR FREDERICK POTTINGER,
SIR FREDERICK POTTINGER, Baronet, was for
years Inspector of Police in N.S.W., and in 1865 was in
charge of Forbes district, when his official secretary
was the late Sulb-inspector (then Senior Constable)
J. J. Fitzpatrick, of Windsor. The latter was brought
into close association with the Baronet, and helped
him out of a serious financial difficulty at one stage
of his career. But that is another story, and a rather
sordid one, too, seeing that after the death of Sir
Frederick (who accidentally shot himself travelling
Sydneywards by coach), his successor, Sir Henry Pot-
tinger, failed to recognise a claim by Sub-inspector
Fitzpatrick, which was vouched for as hona-fide by
the Oriental Bank Corporation of Forbes in a letter
dated May 29, 1865. The amount involved was
�l5B/16/-.
When Dan Mayne lived at Murga, on the road from
Molong to Eugowra and Forbes, he was brought into
contact with Sir Frederick Pottinger, and he told
me the following experience, which is of interest on
general principles,
A race meeting (said Dan) was held at Wowingra-
grong, about three miles from Forbes ?a sort of
amateur meeting, and among the events was one called
?The Ladies? Bag,? the prize being a red, white,
and blue silk bag, containing various articles col-
lected by the ladies in a canvass among the shops.
For this event I entered my horse, Volunteer, and
Sir Frederick Pottinger having asked for the mount
I very readily consented. They were all amateur
riders.
Early on the first morning of the race, Ben Hall,
the bushranger, and his mob called at the course
during the training operations, and were drinking
at one of the booths.
Artie Battye and Dick Read were at the booth, and
Hall got into conversation with them.


?Isn?t Pottinger going to ride Dan Mayne?s horse??
he asked of Dick Read.
?Yes.?
?Well, if you are here you will see a lark. We
will cut Pottinger out, horse and all.?
Word was, of course, passed round, and it came
to my ears. The thing was a bit risky. In any case.
Sir Frederick was no rider; and some of the chaps
were trying to persuade me to get another mount.
Bill Branch?afterwards a bookmaker ?suggested
Ernest Bowler, a son of Major Bowler, and a very
good rider.
But no; I had promised my friend, and he was so
gallant about winning that ladigs? event, that I had
not the heart to interfere at such a late stage.
However, I told him of the intention of the gang,
that he might be on his guard.
?Oh, that is only humbug,? said Sir Frederick.
?I have often heard of that sort of thing.?
All the same, he took the precaution to arrange
for some of his troopers to be stationed at various
parts of the course.
At length the bell rang for this very interesting
event, and. Sir Frederick came along in his jockey
togs?cord breeches, black riding boots, and black
jacket and cap.
?My colours, Dan,? he said, ?in the Old Country.?
He carried a lady?s whip, and looked ?just the
thing.?
There were several in the race, and after they went
out for their preliminary I got wind of another little
affair. A poundkeeper named Elliott was riding in
the race, and he had expressed his determination of
running Sir Frederick off the course. It appears the
poundkeepers all had a down on the Inspector, who
openly alluded to them as rogues. And he was about
right. Each poundkeeper had four or five men on
the job, ?planting? people?s horses till a reward was
offered, or impounding them.


Well, the race started from the distance post, and
Elliott kept his word. Opposite the stand he was
on the inside running of Sir Frederick, and boring
him out, and it was not Iqng before the latter was
right off the track, and galloping among the timber.
And when he at length managed to get back again,
he was, of course, racing a long way in the rear,
and flopping about enough to ruinate any horse s
chance. Battye?s horse, Hollyhock, won. It was very
laughable to see Sir Frederick coming home after the
other horses were back in the saddling paddock. Both
horse and rider were panting.
?Elliott,? he called out, ?you have jockeyed me
to-day, but I?ll jockey you yet? ?meaning, of course,
that he would catch the poundkeeper at some of his
tricks
A thick-tongued squatter, named Collett, protested
against the remark. ?I don?t tink, Hitter Pottinger,
you had a right to tay touch a ting to a man on a
public tourse,? he said.
Sir Frederick; ?Never you mind. I?m not speak-
ing to you.?
� # * * * * *
A week or so after the above event Trooper Fitz-
patrick came to me with a message that Sir Frederick
wanted to see me at once. Up I went, to find my
friend pacing up and down the verandah.
?I have had bad news,? he said.
?Yes, I can see there is something wrong. What
is it??
He handed me a departmental letter, attached to
which was a newspaper clipping, which read some-
thing like this: ?
?While Sir Frederick Pottinger was riding in the ladies?
event at the Forbes races the bushrangers were drinking at
the booth.?
'Mr. (afterwards Sir Charles) Cowper had had his
attention drawn to the paragraph in question, and
he called upon Sir Frederick for an explanation, at


the same time instructing him to consider himself
suspended pending an inquiry.
The clipping was from the Burrangong Argus, pub-
lished at Lambing Flat (now Young). The paper
was edited by Harry Mostyn, formerly editor of
Bells? Life and afterwards of The Forbes Miner.
(Readers will remember me saying that The Miner
used to publish interviews with Gardiner.)
?Well, what are you going to do?? I asked,
?Oh, I fancy I can pull through. I will go to
Sydney, and explain that it was an amateur race;
that I heard that the bushrangers intended to try
and cut me out, and I took the precaution to station
my men round the course in the hope of capturing
them, ? ?
?Can you bring any influence to bear?? I asked.
?Yes, Sir John Young (then Governor) and my
family at home were very intimate, and I am hopeful
that he will do something for me.?
So Sir Frederick took coach to Sydney, sanguine
of being able to pull through alright. He was very
good company, and chatted away to his fellow pas-
sengers in great spirits. There were some ladies
aboard; and the gallant officer was a great ladies?
man.
At one of the stopping places, Springwood, when
the coach pulled up, and the men went into the hotel
for refreshments, Sir Frederick went through the
back and into an orchard and gathered some cherries
for the ladies.
?All aboard!? at length the driver called.
Now Sir Frederick was close to the fence, and to
save going round the back and through the house he
jumped over the fence. As he did so a little flat pocket
pistol which he was in the habit of carrying exploded,
and the bullet penetrated his side.
Great consternation prevailed.
The unfortunate office!* received every attention,
and was taken on to Sydney. He was made com-


for table, at one of the leading hotels, and the best
of medical care was bestowed upon him. Wires kept
coming to Forbes reporting progress. Mr. Stacey,
manager of the Oriental Bank, received them every
day, and he would pass the word along to us all; and
at last we heard that he was out of danger.
But Sir Frederick was not as careful as he should
have been. One night, w r hen a number of friends
were playing cards at the hotel, he got out of bed
to watch the game. This caused a relapse, from
which a few days later he died.
And so ended the career of a very interesting Eng-
lishman, who provided a lot of ?copy? for the Aus-
tralian press, and not a little of our fiction. He was
a fine fellow, every inch a gentleman, and as game
as they make ?em.
He told me the reason he left the Old Country. He
had got the family estate into difficulties through
horse-racing. In his last bet he won �SOO on a famous
American mare called Prioress, and, having thus
raised the wind, with it he cleared out to Australia.
The remains were interred in Sydney?in the old
Devonshire Street cemetery, I think it was ?and the
Forbes people erected the headstone.
Mr. Stacey, his banker, who for years, later on, was
in charge of a bank at Mudgee, attended to the
Baronet?s affairs, which were not too flush. Deceased
was a man who spent his money freely. He lived
beyond his salary, and was in the habit of running
up accounts with the business people. But he also
received regular remittances from home, and with
these would promptly go round and square up. Mr.
Stacey found there were liabilities to the amount of
�6O. He w?rote home to a brother of Sir Frederick,
a solicitor, pointing this out, but received a reply
to the effect that he did not consider himself respon-
sible for his brother?s debts. In connection with the
debt due to Mr. Fitzpatrick, the same reply was
received from the brother, who succeeded to the title.


MARGARET CATCHPOLE AGAIN.
IN the first volume of ?The Good Old Days of the
Hawkesbury, 9 ? published in 1900, effort was made to
once and for all destroy the prevalent idea that
Margaret Catchpole and Mrs. Reibey, or Raby, were
one and the same person. Evidently this result has

And here let me quote from a paper contributed
to the Windsor press some time ago by Mr. Gr. C.
Johnson (a most capable journalist and a student of
Catchpoleiana), in which he institutes comparisons
between Margaret Catchpole and Mary Haydock (late
Mrs. Reibey) :
Mary Haydock, at the age
of 13, was tried for horse
stealing, convicted, and sent
to New South Wales in the
ship ?Royal Admiral,? in the
year 1792. Came out as
?Scott,? and belonged to an
old Lancashire family.
Married Thomas Raby,
7th September, 1794, said
Thomas Raby having come
out in same ship. They
had offspring. He died
May, 1811. Mrs. Raby,
or Reiby, went to Eng-
land with her two daugh-
ters. Visited people in Lan-
cashire; but never went to
Suffolk. Became a wealthy
woman, owned land in many
places. Resided for years at
Reiby House, Newtown;
prior to that at Richmond,
where her daughter was
married to Captain, after-
wards Major Innes. She
died 30th May, 1855, and
was buried in Devonshire
Street Cemetery.

Margaret Catchpole, born
at Nacton, Suffolk, 1762. In
1797 was tried and convicted
for horse stealing. Trans-
ported to N.S.W.; arrived
in the ship ?Nile,? 20th De-
cember, 1801. Was an in-
mate of the Factory, Parra-
matta, for six years. Then
housekeeper at Richmond
Hill till 1811. From then
to her death, in 1819, she
resided at Parramatta, Rich-
mond, Richmond Hill and
Belmont. She never
married. The date of her
death was May 13, 1819;
buried at Richmond on the
14th May, by the Rev. Henry
Fulton, who signed the regis-
ter, Matthew Hughes being
witness thereto. Margaret
Catchpole was 58 years of
age at her death, in 1819 ?
and she died a single woman.

THOSE WERE THE DAYS


Now let the impartial reader compare these two
columns, and see if it he possible to reconcile the
statement that the two persons described are identical.
Mary Haydock was in her teens when she arrived,
in the year 1791; Margaret Catchpole was 37 or 38
when she arrived, in the Nile. She died at Richmond,
and was buried there ?not a doubt of it; Mary Reibey
died at Reibey House, Enmore Road, in 1855, when
she was 75 years of age. Her death is recorded on
the tomb of Thomas Reibey, her husband, as quoted
below; and right here is the record in St. Peter?s
Register, Richmond, of the death of Margaret Catch-
pole :
?Margaret Catchpole, aged 51 years. Came prisoner in
the ?Nile? in the year 1801. Died May 13th, Was buried
May 14th, 1819. ? Henry Fulton.?
She had for years been employed by the Pitt
family at Bronte, near Richmond.
An indefatigable voyager in old Sydney latitudes,
the late Mr. G. R. Nichols, a name historic in Aus-
tralia from the early days of settlement, writes
Mr. J. M. Forde (?Old Chum?), as follows, in con-
nection with Mr. Thomas Reibey, mentioned above: ?
?Dear ?Old Churn,? ?Peruse the enclosed. I found it in the
Mitchell Library in a bound volume of 1810-1811, ?Sydney
Gazette,? evidently at one time the property of Mrs. Mary
Reibey. Her name is on the front cover, with a few notes
in her handwriting, and on the back cover, fastened down
with four of the old-time wafers on a sheet of notepaper,
I found Avhat you see on the enclosure.?
The enclosure is a copy of what was evidently
intended as an inscription to be engraved upon the
tomb of Mr. Reibey, and possibly was on the original
tombstone in the George Street Cemetery. Mr.
Reibey?s remains were removed to the ?new cemetery
at the Sandhills,? and placed in a bricked-in vault,
covered with an altar tomb, where they lay until
the old cemeteries were resumed for railway station


purposes. Mr. Nichols? ?find ?is a highly interesting
one, and will, no doubt, be carefully guarded in the
Mitchell Library:?-

his loss.

is an error of mine.)


The last residence of Mrs. Reibey, Reibey House,
Station Street, Newtown, Avhere she died, is still
standing, gloomy-looking from the ancient trees
which envelop it. For years it was the residence of
Mr. Alexander Bruce, chief inspector of stock. It is
now occupied by Mr. Walter Gawne, a builder, and
next door is ?Reibey Hall.?

The Sydney Gazette notice of the death of Mr,
Reibey read as follows? 31st March, 1811, at his
house in Macquarie Place, after a severe indisposition
of several months, the origin of which he attributed
to coup de soleil when in India, from whence he
returned to the Colony in October last. He was an
affectionate husband and indulgent parent, and leaves
a widow and large family to regret his loss. ? ? Appar-
ently an error in date.
Mr. Thomas Reibey came out to Sydney as an officer
of the ship Royal Admiral, in 1792; on board the ship
was a young girl, Mary Haydock, who a couple of
years afterwards became Mrs. Reibey, and occupied
a high position in the commercial life of Sydney in
its early days. If the date on her tombstone be taken
as correct, Mrs. Reibey must have arrived here a girl
in her sixteenth year, married a couple of years after-
wards, and was left a widow at the age of 34 years.
Thus should be dissipated, once and for all, the
fiction that Margaret Catchpole and Mary Reibey were
one and the same person?yet it may happen that
there will still remain some folk who will not be
convinced. The stories told of long ago?the fictitious
stories?die hard; yet this one should now, on such
evidence as that quoted above, soon be decently buried.
If any additional evidence were needed to settle this
vexed question it would be found in the fact that
whilsts Mrs. Reibey (Mary Haydock) was an educated
woman, possessed of much business acumen, Margaret
Catchpole was illiterate in the extreme, as witness the


quoted letter below, a tracing of which is in the
Mitchell Library, Sydney?a letter written to her aunt
and uncle in England, in 1803: ?

THE FIRST FARMER.
AFTER all, James Ruse was not Australia?s first
farmer, as stated in ?The Good Old Days of the
Hawkesbury? (first volume). The first man to work
the land and grow grain was, we are told by our
oldest historians, one Edward Dod, a member of
Governor Phillip?s household.
In the account of the disembarkation of the first
fleet in Sydney Cove in 1788, we are told ?the live
stock was landed on the east point of the cove, wdien.
having cropped the pasturage, they were removed
to the land of the adjoining cove, which was cleared
for a farm, to be under the direction of a person the
Governor brought out.?
Again, Captain Tench tells us in his History, page
3, that in September, 1788, ?Our cultivation of the
land was yet in its infancy. We had hitherto only
tried the country contiguous to Sydney. Here the
Government had established a Government farm, at
the head of which a competent person of his own
household was placed, with convicts to work under
him. Almost the wholejof the officers likewise accepted
small tracts of ground for the purpose of raising
grain and vegetables.?
Further, we are told by Tench on page 6: ?A new
settlement, named by the Governor, Rose Hill, 16
miles inland, was established on 3rd November (1788),
the soil being judged better than that around Sydney.
A small redoubt was thrown up, and a captain?s de-
tachment posted in it, to protect the convicts who
were employed to cultivate the ground.?
This was the genesis of the present town of Parra-
matta.
We don?t hear much about the farming operations
then till November, 1790. Stores had nearly run out
and the convicts were on very low rations and much


work was not expected, but on 16th November of that
year, Tench tells us of a visit he paid to Rose Hill
as follows: ?I next morning walked round the whole
of the cleared and cultivated land with the Rev. Mr.
Johnson, who is the best farmer in the country.
Edward Dod, one of the Governor?s household, who
conducts everything here 'in the agricultural line,
accompanied us part of the way and afforded us all
the information he could. He estimates the quantity
of cleared and cultivated land at 200 acres; of these
55 are in wheat, barley and a little oats, 30 in maize,
and the remainder is either just cleared of wood,
or is occupied by buildings, gardens, &c. Dod says
he expects this year?s crop of wheat and barley, &c.,
from the 55 acres, to yield fully 400 bushels. Dod
recommends strongly the culture of potatoes on a
large scale.
This same Edward Dod was the man who cultivated
the first farm in Farm Cove, now the Botanical
Gardens, Sydney, and was Australia?s first farmer.
As to James Ruse, he was the first freeholder in
Australia to farm his own land for his own profit.
Dod farmed for the Government, to grow food for
the civil and military, and the convicts. Tench also
tells us about James Ruse as follows: ??Nothing
further of a public nature remaining to examine, I
next visited a humble adventurer, James Ruse. When
his term of punishment expired in August, 1789, he
claimed his freedom, and was permitted by the
Governor, on promising to settle in the country, to
take in the December following an uncleared piece
of ground, with an assurance that if he would culti-
vate it, it should not be taken from him.?
He told Tench he had no person but his wife, whom
he married in this country, to help him. (His wife?s
maiden name was Elizabeth Perry.) This was in
November, 1790, so he was married prior to that date.
Ruse proved most industrious and worked himself


into an independent position free of Government help
by March, 1791, He had previously received his
grant, dated 2nd February, 1790.
Tench, on page 155 of his History, says: *? On Bth
December, 1791, I reached Ruse?s farm and begged
to look at his grant, the material part of which runs
thus A lot of thirty acres, to be called Experiment
Farms, etc.? Ruse now lives in a comfortable brick
house built for him by the Governor. He has eleven
acres and a half in cultivation, and several more
which have been cleared by convicts in their leisure
hours, on condition of receiving the first year?s crop.
He means to cultivate a little maize. Wheat is so
much less productive. His live stock consists of four
breeding sows and thirty fowls. He has been taking
from the store (that is, has supplied himself with
provisions) for some months past, and if he deems
himself able to maintain a convict labourer one is
to be given him.?
Ruse sold this thirty acres to Surgeon John Harris
in 1/93, and it still remains in the Harris family.
James Ruse was one of the first batch of settlers who
esbu ry in January, 1794, and was
granted a farm at the junction of the Hawkesbury
and South Creek (at first called Ruse?s Creek), which
is now said to be in the possession of Mr. Hannabus.
By the way, it was recorded some time since in the
press that Mrs. Levy, grand-daughter of John Ruse,
died at Moss \ ale, aged 81. She was a quiet, good-
natured old body, with lots of anecdotes about old
times and a noble affection for the historical wheat-
grower. Her first husband, Dr. Taylor, of Windsor,
was also a notability in his way. [I have not been
able to discover anything in records bearing upon a
doctor of this name.?F.]


THE EARLIEST WINDSOR NEWSPAPER.
THE following interesting letter is published just as
it appeared in the Winds oi? Gazette :
(To the Editor.)
?Sir In the ?Daily Telegraph? of Saturday last, under
the heading ?A Relic of Early Australia,? it is recorded that
a newspaper of sixty-two years ago had just been discovered
at Flinders Bay, West Australia, and that it was regarded
as a curiosity. It happened that at the time of leading
this paragraph I was searching among some old news-
papers in my library and lighted upon two copies of the
?Hawkesbury Courier,? dated August 15 and 22, 1844. This
newspaper was printed and published by G. A. Eagai,
ivhom and his son I can distinctly remember. The punting
office was in the house, Bridge-street, adjoining the store
now kept by Mr. William Moses. The reading of these old
newspapers brought up to my mind many associations of
my youth. Among other things they contain a conspicuous
advertisement of an exhibition which I myself attended
when ten years old, at the White Hart Inn, kept by Mi.
Blanchard, which stood on the site now occupied by Messrs.
W. Beard and Co.?s ironmongery store. In those days,
when Windsor could boast of many public houses, there
was another inn adjoining, kept by Mr. E. Robinson, on the
site now occupied by Pulsford and Co.?s drapery establish-
ment. The objects exhibited at Blanchard?s in August,
1844, were chiefly an ourang-outang and two anacondas.
The former was a female and dressed in woman?s clothes.
It was quite docile and used to walk about the parloui of
the inn. The snakes were kept in a large box in one of the
out-buildings at the rear of the hotel. Another interesting
item in the old newspaper is an advertisement to the effect
that a reading-room furnished with colonial and foreign
newspapers and magazines would be opened at the office of
the ?Hawkesbury Courier.? I do not know if this venture
succeeded, but it was one of the first attempts, if not the
first, to establish a reading-room in Windsor. lam aware
that a lending library was established in New-street on
April Ist, 1847. Can any of your readers inform me if
the ?Hawkesbury Courier? was the first newspaper printed
in Windsor ? Yours faithfully, John Tebbtjtt,
The Peninsula, Windsor, June 1, 1908.
[The first Windsor newspaper was ?The Windsor Express,?
quarto, its proprietor, Mr. G. A. Eagar, May, 1843. A


journalist named Jeffrey assisted Mr. Eagar to write the
paper up, and it supported the candidature of Mr. Wm. Bow-
man. It ran for about a year. Another year elapsed before
a successor came along in the shape of ?The Hawkesbury
Courier,? referred to by Mr. Tebbutt?July, 1844. Messrs.
Hatham and Foster, proprietors of the ?Sydney Australian,?
were the publishers, and Mr. G. A. Eagar was the printer. It
ultimately (in 1846, January), drifted into the hands of Mr.
Eagar, and a month or two afterwards became defunct,
Windsor had no paper again until 1850, when Mr. Benjamin
Isaacs established the ?Telegraph,? edited by Mr. Albermarle
Layard, but the publication suffered an early demise, and not
until 1860, July, did anyone make an effort to fill this gap.
Then came a badly-printed penny weekly, issued by Mr. W.
Doyle; it soon died, and other papers followed in its wake,
until to-day the ?Windsor and Richmond Gazette,? established
by Mr. J. C. L. Fitzpatrick in 1888, is the sole survivor.?F.]
AN OLD RECORD.
MR. J. F. COBCROFT, of Windsor, has left with
us an interesting old record, of ?ye olden days.?
It is in the form of a ledger kept by one, Yeomans,
who conducted a store at Wilberforce in the days
before any of the people now living in the Hawkes-
bury district were born. The old book bears date 1827,
In it are the accounts of many Wilberforce people who
dealt at the store kept by Yeomans. Features of the
old record are the remarkable preservation of the ink
with which the entries were made, and the copperplate-
like writing. One rarely sees writing like it nowadays?
so even in alignment and every letter perfectly formed.
Some of the names appearing in the old ledger will
bring back memories of other days to many living in
the district at the present time. Here are some of
them : Joseph Brown, David Brown, William Hunter,
Richard Lyons, John Dunston, Stephen Dunston,
Thomas Rose, John Rose, Robert Farlow, Thomas
Abel, Mathew Lock, Thomas Graham, Edward Rey-
nolds, John Cobcroft, Edward Shrimpton, William
Farlow, Michael Nowland, Henry Nowland, Henry
Moore, George King, Richard Cobcroft, Nathan Lock,


William Nowland, Thomas Lovell, Thomas Moloney,
Paul Bushell. Some of the entries in the book are
interesting. Here is one man?s account which is a
fair example:?
October 4th, 1827,
� s. d.
6 lbs. of tea at 5/- lb 1 10 0
24 lbs. sugar at Bd. lb 0 16 0
7 yards of Print at 3/6 a yard 14 6
4 yards of Calico at 2/9 a yard Oil 0
2 gallons of Brandy, 30/- a gallon 3 0 0
2 gallons Rum at 18/- a gallon 1 16 0
The old hands were pretty strong on spirituous
stuff, as the following account of another man will
show;?
October 6, 1827.
� s. <l.
2 gallons Brandy, 30/- a gallon .. 3 0 0
2 gallons Rum, at 18/- a gallon 1 10 0
3 gallons Gin, 20/- a gallon ~ ? ? 3 0 0
1 lb. of Tobacco, 8/- alb 0 8 0
1 Blue Jacket, 40/- 2 0 0
Sugar at Bd. per lb., tea at 5/- per lb., and calico
at 2/9 per yard would cause much consternation to
the housewife who is to-day shrieking at the high
prices of living commodities.
Glancing at other entries, we find a pair of
duck trousers sold at 10/-, a check shirt at 6/6, and
silk ditto at 5/-! Cotton must have been more ex-
pensive than silk in those days. A pocket handker-
chief cost 3/6, but a silk ditto was 5/-, so the order
is reversed in this instance.
THE EVERINGHAMS.
WHO has not heard of the Hawkesbury Evering-
hams? ?their name and fame have spread over the
whole State ?nay, the whole Continent. The Bvering-
hams have played an important part in the early
pioneering stages of the river. On this account alone
they must not be passed over.


Matthew James Everingham, the founder of this
well-known and highly-respected family, arrived in
the colony in the year 1788. He received a grant
of land from the Crown, and for some years lived
opposite Mr. Manning?s residence at Lower Sackville.
The block of land known as Cook?s wharf, at the
botttom of Kaiser?s farm, was a grant from Mr. Ever-
ingham to an old Englishman, names James Cook,
for life.
Matthew Everingham died on the 25th December,
1817, his remains being laid to rest in the Wilber-
force Church of England cemetery.
The Everinghams have always been great church
people, and two of them, George and Thomas (sons
of Matt), were especially noted as local preachers
in their day. The former was known on more than
one occasion to walk from Sackville to Lower Hawkes-
bury to conduct service.
These two brothers were also prominent in the boat-
building line on the river in the 40?s and 50?s. The
Valentine Ward and the Queen, two well-known
vessels on the Hawkesbury at that period, were some
of their handiwork.
Another of their boats was the Speculator ?better
known as the Roaring Gimlet. She was built
opposite Manning?s, where the old flour mill used to
stand. (This was called the Horse Flour Mill from
the fact that it was in some way worked with the
assistance of that very useful quadruped.) The
Roaring Gimlet was quite a novelty in her way, being-
propelled by paddle-wheels, worked by hand labour.
She created not a little interest when George and
Steven took her up to Windsor on her initial trip?
these two gentlemen being, in fact, the ?engineers.?
The name of Roaring Gimlet was given this boat by
?Black Phil,? an aboriginal, who held for a number
of years the post of punt-man at the old Pitt Town
ferry. The Gimlet was ultimately sold, and converted
into a sailing vessel, I think.


Another son of Matthew Everingham was William,
and it is with this gentleman and his sons I wish
principally to deal.
William held some official position on the river in
his time ?that of chief constable, I believe. (Times
were a bit more troublesome on the river then than
now.) He met his death by drowning in the year
1859 at Lower Portland, immediately opposite where
Peacock?s house stands. It appears that a boat was
engaged in the illicit rum-selling business, and Mr.
Everingham, with several other gentlemen, all hold-
ing official positions, went on board to investigate
matters. After taking an inventory of the boat?s
cargo, Mr. Everingham?s colleagues went to Peacock?s
to have dinner, and, on their return made the appal-
ling discovery that Mr. Everingham had been drowned
from the boat in their absence. Many advanced the
opinion that he met his death by foul play, but this
*s one of the many mysteries of old times on the river
which must for ever remain unsolved.
MR. GEORGE M. PITT.
AMONG the pioneer residents of North Sydney was
the late Mr. George Matcham Pitt, a gentleman who
founded the well-known firm of Pitt, Son & Badgery,
Limited, so popular in pastoral, wool and stock circles.
He was a grand man, full of mental and bodily
vigour, and his figure was as well known to early
residents as his company was appreciated.
He was a descendant of Lord Nelson. Mrs. Mary
Pitt, the first of the family to visit Australia, was
a cousin of George Matcham, whose wife was a sister
of Admiral Lord Nelson. She left England in the
Canada, a vessel of 400 tons, in the year 1801, four
years before the fame of Nelson had reached its cul-
minating point. With her were one son and four
daughters?Thomas Matcham, Esther, Jemima, Lucy
and Susanna. The last-named became the wife of
Mr. William Faithful! who later settled on a grant


of land at Canterbury. Thomas Matcham Pitt died
at a comparatively early age, but his son, George
Matcham Pitt, lived to the age of 82.
The subject of this notice passed a large portion
of his useful life at North Sydney, in the progress
of which he took a lively interest. It was not long
after his arrival that he commenced to take that
interest in its development that later gained for him
the appreciation of his fellow-citizens. He became
an alderman of the East St. Leonards Municipal
Council, and later occupied the Mayoral chair with
great benefit to the community and credit to him-
self. To his energy and sustained effort North Sydney,
in a large measure, owes its water supply, as he was
instrumental in securing the first service, which was
laid in flexible pipes across the harbour between
Hawes and MBson?s Points,
The remembrances of the old folk who used to go
over in the North Shore ferry when it was a rowing
boat tell of his weight and how the ferryman used to
carry three 56-lb. weights to balance the craft when
Mr. G. M, Pitt was the only passenger. His was a
breezy nature, and his presence on the later date ferry
boats w r as known to all travellers, who recognised his
genial laugh and listened to his lively anecdotes and
poetical quotations.
There was much romance in the family coming out
to this country. Governor King was in power at the
time, and letters of introduction to him from the
Nelson family made the way pleasanter for Mrs. Mary
Pitt, to whose son, Thomas Matcham Pitt, the
Governor signed grants of land. Mrs. Mary Pitt lived
to the good old age of 72, dying in 1815 at the resi-
dence of Mr. James Wilshire, the husband of her
daughter Esther, who was married in 1805. For
several years the family lived a pioneering life, but
coming from Dorsetshire, they were able to wrest
from the land grain and fruits, and to provide them-
selves with the necessities and some of the luxuries


of life. So before the end came the brave old lady
saw her family well-to-do, and enjoyed a good measure
of reward for all the anxiety, privations and worries
of a bold venture in a new land.
George Matcham, her cousin, having faith in the
new land, in 1829 sent his son out to grow wheat,
breed sheep and otherwise make wealth and develop
the country. This son, Mr. C. H. N. Matcham, formed
a station near Gosford, Brisbane Water. How master-
ful the minds of all the branches of the Nelson family
were is shown in the following letter, written by
Lieutenant Arthur Davies, R.N., a brother-in-law of
C. H. N. Matcham, who had settled in Tasmania in
1836. He quite prophetically said: ?
?We have here the seeds of a mighty empire, which will
ere long make known its claims to an earthly immortality,
like the former empires which have blossomed, and then
shone to a full maturity. This little colony is fairly
on its legs, and misgovernment itself cannot spoil our
prospects nor those of New South Wales. Our population
is rapidly increasing, our trade extending to all parts of
the world, and I hope the spirit of the people is firmly and
nobly developing itself in accordance with the enlightened
maxims of the age in which we live. If I mistake not the
tenor of Lord Glenelg?s just and joyous bearing towards the
free inhabitants of the dependencies of the Empire, the day
is fast approaching when both New South Wales and Van
Diemen?s Land will be in possession of their full privileges
with a House of Assembly to each. In this case you may be
prepared to witness a still more rapid development of our
resources than anything which has appeared, either in for-
mer times here,, or in any new country in the world.?
THE WINDREDS.
THE Windreds form one of the earliest of Australian
families, and from the Hawkesbury district they have
gradually gravitated over the face of N.S.W., until
to-day their name is legion. In his ?Hawkesbury
Reminiscences,? Dan Mayne thus referred to the
Dargins and Windreds: ?Mrs. Sophia Windred, who
for years was closely associated with Bathurst, was


one of the ancient family of Dargins. Her mother
kept the ?Red Lion? on the corner of Baker Street,
and there was a big family of sons and daughters.
John Dargin died at Bathurst. Joe was a great sport,
and came somewhat into the limelight when, as a
pugilist, he met Johnny Gorrick, one of the noted
prize-fighters of the days, and who went home as
?Bungaree? to try conclusions with Johnny Broome,
the best man of his weight then in England. Another
of Sophia Windred?s brothers was William, a six-
footer, and powerfully built. He met Ned Chalker,
the champion of N.S.W., and was defeated after fight-
ing 63 rounds. Imagine the stamina of a man to
stand up for such a lengthy battle! Bill was also a
champion skittle-player; and I remember him playing
?Brickie? for �25 aside, but losing.
The elder Jim Dargin had two or three daughters.
One married Charles Marsden, a cattle-dealer in
Windsor, who died. His widow married a bank-
manager, and they went to live in Castlemaine (Vic.).
The other daughter was the widow of the late William
Forrester, of Warwick Farm. Then there were, at
the time of writing (1900), Miss Louisa Dargin, of
Windsor, and Albert Dargin, living at Newtown,
Windsor?surviving members of the elder James?s
family.
The Dargins were very popular and important
people in Windsor in those days.
Mrs. Windred reared a fine family?Joseph,
William, John, Harry, Charlie, George, and Dick.
Joe was away awhile in California, and on his return
went butchering at Sofala, and afterwards settled in
Pitt Street, Sydney, as a publican, opposite the
present Tattersall?s. Although an hotelkeeper, I
never knew him to take a glass of grog, nor did he
smoke. He kept two well-bred hackneys for his own
special use. It must have cost him a bit, for he
stabled them at Martin?s bazaar in Pitt Street. In
the morning he would do the city on the chestnut,


and in the afternoon would be out on Ariosto. Again,
having the Dargin fighting blood in his veins, on the
mother?s side, he became a boxer; but the only battle
I remember him fighting was with Ben Mortimer,
of Richmond, Windred winning. He was a game ?un.
Later on he went to the Lachlan and kept an hotel;
then to Orange, selling out the latter hotel to the
late James Torpy, later newspaper proprietor and
member of Parliament. Joe then took to auction-
eering, did well, built a nice cottage just out of town,
and cultivated beautiful flower gardens. He took a
prominent interest in the Race Club, and became one
of the guarantors for a �1,300 overdraft to make big
improvements. But after a bit the bank foreclosed,
and poor Windred had to sell out his cottage to plank
up the guarantee money.
The very old hands in Windsor may remember Joe
Windred living in a row of cottages by the present
water-works pumping station, before he went up
country. He married the widow of an Imperial soldier
?a sergeant ?who had a daughter, Bella. In time
she became known as Windred?s stepdaughter, but
was mostly referred to as ?the soldier?s daughter.?
Subsequently, Miss Bella married the well-known
western man, Mr. James Torpy.
FIRST AUSTRALIAN POET.
IT is a popular superstition that Charles Harpur
(whose widow, the Mary of many of his most tender
poems, died very recently down south) was the very
first Australian poet. But this is not so. Charles
Tompson, junr., is undoubtedly entitled to the honour.
He published a volume of his sonnets as far back
as 1830, and a copy of same may be seen at the
Public Library, Sydney. Both Tompson and Harpur
were natives of the Hawkesbury River, the former
being born at Clydesdale, and educated by the Rev.


Henry Fulton, whose name is associated with early
colonisation at Castlereagh House, Castlereagh. As
a young man, he received an appointment as third-
class clerk in the Colonial Secretary?s office, and
resided in upper Kent Street during the years 1833-34.
In 1835 his home was at Doon Moor Cottage, Penrith,
his father still occupying the family estate at Clydes-
dale. Tompson dedicated his poems?which were for
the most part local and many of them devoted to
commendation and praise of the public acts of
Governor Lachlan Macquarie?to Rev. Henry Fulton.
Appended to the volume of Tompson?s poems in
the Public Library is a letter written by Tompson
to a G. R. Nicholls, a solicitor, who had an office at
Brougham Place, Sydney. It is franked with one
of the first 2d. postage stamp impressions, which at
the time did duty for the adhesive ones of later date.
The letter was presented to the Public Library by
the late Mr. W. Astley, Sydney, on 21st October,
1891, and he writes in pencil a footnote to Tompson?s
signature, as follows: ?The first native-born poet in
New South Wales, and the second appointed clerk
to the Legislative Council of New South Wales.? The
following is a copy of the letter, which is written in
a neat, delicate style of penmanship:?
Mr. C. Moore?s ?James? Buildings,
George St., 7th Oct., 1836.
My dear sir, ?I am lodging as above, and will be quite
ready to meet you on any day and hour you may appoint,
at Mr. Chambers?, to sign, the document you mentioned to
me, between this and Tuesday evening next, at which time
I leave town.
Yours very truly,
Chas. Tompson, Junr.
G. R. Nicholls, Esq.
In a footnote to the following poem, Tompson says:
?This was written at Castlereagh Seminary, in 1818,
when I was but twelve years of age. My youth at


that time may prove an excuse for my offering them
to the public.? In another portion of his small
volume he adds that it was his first poem, and was
written in a wattlegrove at Castlereagh hamlet; ?
ODE TO SPRING.
O thou, who, unsuspected, steal?st serene
Into the bosom of the fertile year.
Tell me of climates which I ne?er have seen,
And let me feel the fragrance thou didst bear.
For with thy presence nature is adorned,
Clad in grey green, luxuriant and mild,
Erewhile the embryo blossom lay unformed
In sweet profusion scattered o?er the wild.
Till, by degrees, it, op?ning to the sun,
Now spreads enamour?d, to his warmer ray;
At length, by aged infirmity, o?ercome
?Twill, once more closing, droop and die away.
Thus, in the midst of pleasures, man?s cut off,
Struck by the never-erring aim of death;
Tiro? some, above their fellows, rise aloft,
Yet fate, at length, will stop their vital breath.
Charles Harpur, whose poems are of a very high
standard of excellence, was a native of Windsor, where
his father was a teacher of a private school in the
early days?so that the old Hawkesbury district, re-
nowned for the sturdy men and women it produced
from the earliest period of its settlement, is the birth-
place of the two earliest Australian poets. In addi-
tion to this, it was for years the home of the famous,
or infamous, G. Barrington, whose Australian history
is somewhat of a ?standard? work (Barrington was
for years Chief Constable there and owned land in
the district in 1791) ; as well as of another notable
man, James Hardy Vaux, a London pickpocket, whose
Memoirs (1800-1806) form most interesting reading.
In connection with the publication of the above, the
following letter was received from the late Mr. George
R. Nichols, whose interest in matters of moment


regarding early Australian history, has been evidenced
on many occasions:?
Llandilo, Via St. Mary?s,
6th April, 1916.
J. C. L. Fitzpatrick, Esq., M.L.A.,
Sydney.
Dear Mr. Fitzpatrick, ?Re Charles Tompson . In y6ur
Good Old Days of the Hawkesbury? and other writings,
you have asserted that our friend the poet was born at
Clydesdale; but I have to doubt this, but cannot prove it.
Clydesdale consisted of 700 acres granted to one Walter
Lang. I cannot so far fix the date of the grant, but be-
lieve it to be 1810. At all events, in the ?Sydney Gazette,?
I find the following marriage??on 17th June, 1812, Walter
Lang, recently from India, to Miss Elizabeth Harris, niece
of Mr. James Larra, at St. John?s, Parramatta.? This
Walter Lang died, I believe, in 1819. I will fix the date
when next in Sydney. On his death, Clydesdale was sold
to Charles Tompson, senior. In the ?Gazette? of Bth
January, 1820, Charles Thompson announces that he has
opened a butcher?s shop at No. 15 Hunter St., next to the
house he now lives in. (He was living there during all
second decade.) In the same ?Gazette? he advertises part
of Clydesdale (house and cultivation) to let, reserving the
run, and describes it as ?late the property of Walter Lang,
deceased.?
This all leads me to think Charles Tompson, senior, was
not living at Clydesdale in 1807, when his son Charles was
born. Why do you say he was born at Clydesdale?
Yours truly,
George R. Nichols.
REV. SAMUEL MARSDEN.
THE following copy of the Eev. Samuel Marsdeu?s
epitaph inscribed upon his tomb in St. John?s ceme-
tery, Parramatta, may be accepted as authentic:?
?To the memory of the
Rev. Samuel IVJarsden,
Minister of St. John?s, Parramatta, for nearly half a
century, and one of the first chaplains who arrived in the
Colony. He departed this life May 12th, 1838.
Aged 73 years.?
One of the best accounts of the chief chaplain?s life
and work was in a book written by the Rev. J. B.


Marsden, M.A., being the memoirs of the life and
labours of the Rev. Samuel Marsden, of Parramatta,
and of his early connexion with the missions to New
Zealand and Tahiti. Strange to say, Rev. J. B.
Marsden was not related in any way to the chaplain
whose memoirs he edited. The memoirs provide very
interesting reading. Several extracts are made from
the late Lieut. Saddlier?s manuscript life of Rev.
Samuel Marsden. Some valuable information is
derived from the hitherto unpublished correspondence
of Mr. J. S. Nicholas, who accompanied Marsden on
his first voyage to New Zealand. The volume, now
very rare, that I have before me was originally the
property of Rev. Thos. Hassall, M.A., a son-in-law
of Marsden, and Incumbent of St. Paul s, Cobbity.
The following account of his closing days may be of
interest to many of your readers. I quote from the
?memoirs?: ?
?On Tuesday, the Bth of May, 1838, a few of his friends
visited him in his own house, and they wished him, as they
thought, a short farewell as he stepped into his gig on a
journey of about five-and-twenty miles. In passing through
the low lands contiguous to Windsor the cold suddenly
affected him, and he complained of illness on his arrival
at the house of his friend, the Revd. Mr. Styles, the chap-
lain of the parish. Erysipelas of the head broke out, and a
general stupor followed, so that he became insensible.
Though he spoke but little,? said Mr. Styles, ?in his con-
scious moments he said quite enough to show that the
Saviour was with him. Soon after, inflammation having
reached his brain, his spirit was released. On Saturday
morning, the 12th of May, he entered?who can doubt??
upon the enjoyment of his eternal and exceeding great
reward.?
It is evident that the funeral sermon preached by
the Rev. H. T. Stiles, M.A., provided the editor of
?Marsden?s Memoirs? with the above account of the
chaplain?s death.
He was buried in his own churchyard at Parra-
matta. Upwards of sixty carriages formed the mourn-
ing train, and the assemblage included most of the


public officials of the colony, the service being read
by the Ven. Archdeacon Cowper, D.D., who himself
came to the colony at Samuel Marsden?s solicitation.
TOMBSTONE SCRIBES.
TO find a comprehensive heading for this chapter
has involved the loss of much brain tissue. ? ? Picnick-
ing Amongst the Tombs,? while explicit, is somewhat
paradoxical, and ?A Holiday with the Gravestones?
might lead the reader to the conclusion that he was
to read of a holiday, whereas my theme is graveyards.
The first visit was to the church at Wilberforce.
It will be remembered that the first settlers on the
ITawkesbury, in 1794, w r ere located on South Creek,
near Wilberforce. The church standing on a hill
behind the town was built in 1867, as a sundial on
the wall proclaims. In the cemetery we found a
number of interesting stones, of which the most im-
portant was that shown in the accompanying illus-
tration.
It records the death of Michael James Everingham,
one of the ?first fleeters.? Tench relates that on a
visit to the ?Ponds? (North Parramatta), he found
amongst the settlers Matthew Everingham, an
?Attorney?s clerk,? of whom he writes: ?The Attor-
ney s clerk I also thought out of his province; I dare
believe that he finds cultivating his own land not half
so easy a task as he formerly found that of stringing
together volumes of tautology to encumber, or con-
vey, away that of his neighbour.? On May 18, 1811,
Everingham advertised that the late Andrew Thomp-
son?s tan-yards, etc., at West Hill, were to let on
application to him at ?West Hill Farm, Hawkes-
bury. ? ?
Another tomb at Wilberforce was to the memory
of Thomas Rose, who died on November 15, 1833, aged
84 years. Mr. Rose, I believe, was one of the five
free settlers who came out in the Bellma, which
arrived in Port Jackson on January 16, 1793, and has


to-day a number of descendants to keep his memory
green.
The next point of call was the God's Acre of St.
Peter?s Church of England, Richmond. The ceme-
tery was consecrated in 1814, although the first burial
was in 1809. The church was consecrated in 1841.
A local antiquary, at the expense of much time and
figuring, has prepared the following particulars re-
garding the cemetery: ?
?In round numbers the aggregated ages of persons buried
there would make the grand total of 28,420 years. The
burials number 732, and carry with them the total number
of 973 Christian names. We find 18 persons whose births
and deaths occurred in the same month, while some 18 names
carry no ages. The maximum age of 108 years was lived
by W. Magick, and the minimum age of 4 hours was lived
by Stella Mary Ezzy. Thomas John survived his 100 th year,
while Mary Ann Search died in her 100 th year. From the
age of 90 to 100 we find 6; from 80 to 90 there are 47;
while the grand total of 102 saw from 70 up to 80 years of
mundane enjoyments. As we descend the scale they become
too numerous to mention, albeit I may say there are 226
verses, texts, etc.?
Here we discovered the resting - place of another
?first fleeter.? The inscription reads, ?Sacred to
the memory of Thos. Spencer, who came to this colony
in the First Fleet, a marine, and departed this Life
Feby. 3, 1821. Aged 61 years.? To walk through
this old graveyard is to step right back to the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century and to meet those
sturdy old pioneers who carved out fortune from the
banks of the Hawkesbury. Here are some of the
names we noted: ?Bowiman, Rouse, Pitt, Faithfull
and Cox. We did not find the grave of Margaret
Catchpole, but, strange to say, met in the cemetery
a living member of the Pitt family, and when
Margaret died she was in the employ of his fore-
father.
To return to our subject, our final inspection was
of the cemetery at Castlereagh. It is tucked away
in the bush, some distance from the village. One


HAWKESBURY VOLUNTEERS OF 1860 153
object of our visit was to discover the grave of the
Rev. Henry Fulton, who laboured in the district, and
was the master of a private school, which is referred
to in Wentworth?s ?Description of N.SW.? (1820)
as the best in the colony.
HAWKESBURY VOLUNTEERS OF 1860.
IN the year 1860 there were clouds hanging over the
Homeland, Great Britain, and there was serious talk
of a European war. The patriotism of the nation
was raised to an enthusiastic pitch, and in these far-
distant portions of the Queen?s dominions, there was
not wanting the sense of loyalty and patriotism, and
an earnest desire to give some little service in the
defence of the country. Upwards of one hundred
men of Windsor, in all positions in life, including
clergymen, bankers, magistrates, prominent business
men, and artisans stood shoulder to shoulder, in order
to be trained for the service that would be required
of them in case of emergency. Here is reproduced
the oath of allegiance taken from the original roll of
the Hawkesbury Volunteers of 1860, and beneath it
the names of the first one hundred men who signed
it, and whose names may well be recorded on a ?Roll
of Honour. ? ?
OATH.
I do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful
and bear true allegiance to her Majesty Queen Victoria,
as lawful Sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland, and of this Colony of New South Wales de-
pendent on and belonging to the said United Kingdom and
that I will faithfully serve Her said Majesty in the said
Colony for the defence of the same against all Her enemies
and opposers whatsoever.
So Help me God!

THE FLYING PIEMAN.
WHO is this that comes pacing along the road with
such wonderful speed ? Ah! This is a pedestrian
indeed! It is King?the famous ?Flying Pieman?
?well-known in Sydney from 1842 onwards for the
following thirty years. Many of his extraordinary
feats in pedestrianism were performed on the Parra-
matta Road; such as walking from Sydney to Parra-
matta against time; walking thither carrying, on vari-
ous occasions, either a boy, a sheep, or a goat, and
with a live encumberance of this character on his
shoulder, racing Titterton?s stage-coach. William
Francis King was ?an eccentric of the eccentrics,?
and had a ?most strange, eventful history.? He was
born in London in 1807, and came of a very respect-
able family, his father, Francis King, Esq., being
Paymaster at the Treasury, Whitehall. As showing
how strangely the plans of parents, with regard to


the future of their offspring, sometimes miscarry,
it may be noted that young King was ?intended for
the Church,? but he was a lad of most boisterous
ways, and his absorbing love of field-sports soon
proved him unfitted for any sedate occupation, and
means were early afforded him for entering into
partnership with a firm of stock and sharebrokers in
the great Metropolis; but he soon sold out of this
business, and entered as a clerk in the Treasury
Department of the Tower of London. This office also
was soon thrown up, and in 1839 King sailed for
New South Wales, with glowing hopes of receiving
some Government situation there, through the in-
fluence of the high testimonials brought with him.
No such appointment, however, was in store for him,
and he was glad to settle down for a time as school-
master at Sutton Forest, which opening was pro-
cured for him by Archdeacon Broughton, afterwards
Bishop of this colony. Quitting this service, King
went as tutor in a private family for a time, but his
restless spirit finding this employment too monoton-
ous, he hired as a barman at the ? * Hope and Anchor, ? ?
a public house at the corner of Pitt and King Streets,
which sign was subsequently altered to the ? ? Rainbow
Tavern,? and afterwards to ?Punch?s Hotel.? Prom
this time he took much pleasure in attempting all
manner of pedestrian feats, and threw up a regular
situation to follow the trade of a ? hot pieman. ? ? Many
old residents will remember King and his bright tin
pie-can, with its glowing furnace of charcoal and its
reservoir of ?gravy.? Such cans and pie-vendors
were once very familiar sights in the streets of Sydney,
but King, who, from his occupation and rapid gait,
had received the popular soubriquet of ?The Flying
Pieman,? was far and away the most noted specimen
of the whole genus. With regard to his pedestrian
feats, many sporting men took advantage of King?s
simple, easy-going disposition, and the best years of
his life were devoted to these trials of speed, strength.


and endurance, without any lasting profit to himself.
When his ?best days? for such exhibitions were over,
King drifted into a restless, aimless, imbecile sort
of existence, traversing the, streets of Sydney with
his tall hat decorated with ribbon-streamers and busi-
ness cards, and with a long staff similarly adorned
in his hands, issuing half-mad, rambling kinds of
proclamations, as if he fancied himself a royal herald.
He at last found a refuge in the Liverpool Asylum
for destitute men, where he remained until his death
on August 12, 1874. Many of the walking tasks per-
formed by him were most remarkable, and very many
of them were carried out on the road we are now
traversing. He walked from the old Obelisk in Mac-
quarie Place, Sydney, to the sixteen-mile stone, Parra-
matta and back in six hours; walked from Sydney
to Parramatta and back, twice a day, for six con-
secutive days; carried a live goat weighing ninety-
two pounds, with twelve pounds dead weight besides,
from Watkin?s old ?Talbot Inn,? on Brickfield Hill,
Sydney, to Nash?s ?Woolpack Inn,? Parramatta, and
back, in seven hours, less twelve minutes; beat the
coach from Windsor to Sydney, arriving seven minutes
before it; he walked 500 half-miles in 500 half-hours;
walked 1,000 quarter-miles in 1,000 quarter-hours;
and walked 1,634 miles in five weeks and four days,
out of which period he only had nine days fine
weather.
Speaking of stage coaches: A goodly array used
to pass along Parramatta Road daily, fifty years ago.
They had not only their old-fashioned drivers, ala
Tony Weller, but their ?guard,? their ?insides and
outsides, ? ? their ? ?boot ? and ? rumble. ? ? Every after-
noon at four o?clock, the Parramatta and Windsor
Royal Mail used to start from the Post Office, George
Street, and, at the same hour, the Liverpool Royal
Mail
They were great institutions, these coaches, and
much as the world has advanced there are not want-


mg those in the community, especially in the ranks
of the pioneers, who would hail their return to the
roads with much real enthusiasm.
MR. JOHN TEBBUTT.
AN Interesting article appeared in the Windsor press
in 1900, dealing with the life and career of Mr. John
Tebbutt, landowner and astronomer, a picturesque
figure, known to every man, woman, and child within
the Hawkesbury District area. It is printed in full
below, but since it originally appeared Mr. Tebbutt
has passed away to the land of the shades and the
shadows, with all his honours thick upon him:?
?John Tebbutt, F.R.A.S., of Peninsula Observa-
tory, Windsor, a gentleman who, by reason of the
prominent position to which he has v attained in the
scientific world, is entitled to the highest encomiums
capable of being passed upon him. He is the grand-
son of a very old colonist. His grandfather, John
Tebbutt, emigrated to this colony in the year 1801,
bringing with him his wife, two sons (Thomas and
John), and an only daughter. Soon after their arrival
in the colony the family gave themselves up to farm-
ing pursuits in the Hawkesbury district, but this
occupation proving rather unsuccessful they opened
a general store in the town of Windsor, which rapidly
became the most important in the district. John, the
younger of the two brothers, married, and the fruit
of this union was the birth, in Windsor, on the 25th
May, 1834, of the subject of our sketch. The busi-
ness referred to was closed about the year 1842, and
the father then purchased the Peninsula estate at the
eastern extremity of the town, built thereon a resi-
dence, and devoted himself to agricultural pursuits.
The son was educated in private, schools, his first tutor
being the parish clerk, Mr. Edward Quaife, and in
succession, the Revs. M. Adam and H. T. Stiles, M.A..
under the last of whom he received a sound, classical
education. The attention of the youth, who was in-


dined to mechanical pursuits, was first directed to
astronomy about the year 1853, and his love for the
science was quickened in no small degree by his fre-
quent intercourse with his first tutor, Mr. Quaife,
who had a fair, knowledge of its outlines, and some
of whose early contributions may be found in the
New South Wales Calendar and General Post Office
Directory for 1835. It was not until 1864 that Mr.
Tebbutt became possessed of instrumental means
adapted for fairly good work, but in the meantime
he had made great advances in the higher mathe-
matics, and was thoroughly acquainted with the theory
of astronomical instruments before he came to their
actual employment. At the close of 1863 he erected
a small observatory on the Peninsula estate, a property
which he subsequently inherited from his father, the
building being constructed of wood, and wholly the
work of his own hands. In this building he installed
a small transit instrument and a refractor,
mounted by himself as an equatorial. His instru-
mental means gradually grew in importance, and for
some years past, he has possessed two substantial
observatories of brick, which accommodate an excel-
lent 3-inch transit instrument by Cook and Sons, a
4f/2-inch equatorial by the same makers, and lastly,
an 8-inch equatorial refractor by Grubb, acquired in
1886. Mr. Tebbutt was elected a member of the local
Royal Society in 1862, and he is, therefore, one of
the few members now living who joined it when it
bore the title of the Philosophical Society of New
South Wales. As early as 1863 his abilities were so
far recognised by the Rev. W. Scott, M.A., the first
Government Astronomer, that he was recommended
as his successor to the office. In 1869 his work was
of such importance that his private institution was
placed on the list of principal observatories in the
?British Nautical Almanac,? and soon afterwards
it was recognised in a similar way in the national
ephemeridges of the United States, France, Germany,


Brazil, and Mexico. In 1867 Mr. Tebbutt was selected
by the local Commissioners of the Paris Exhibition
to write a paper on the ?State and Progress of
Astronomy in New South Wales,? which was duty
published in the catalogue prepared by that body and
subsequently reprinted in an enlarged form in the
?Industrial Progress of New South Wales, 1870?
For this paper he received a commemorative silver
medal. In 1873 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society, but for 11 years previously
his astronomical contributions were published by the
society. As a proof of his industry, it may be stated
that of the 36 annual volumes of the ?Monthly
Notices? since 1862, there is only one which dobs not
contain work done by him. He has also been a regular
contributor for the past 35 years to the ?Astrono-
is realty the international
journal of the science. With the exception of some
occasional meteorological work, he has been the sole
observer in connection with his observatory. In the
reduction of the observations he has obtained occa-
sional assistance from outside sources. He has had
the pleasure of seeing a large portion of his work
utilized by some of the most distinguished astronomers,
and the testimonials, both public and private, which
he has received from them are of the most gratifying
character. His astronomical work has been of a
varied character, but it was mainly directed to the
observation of lunar occupations of stars, phenomena
of Jupiter?s satellites, comets, minor planets, and
double stars. He published no fewer than 987 obser-
vations of occupations, wdiich will hereafter afford
splendid material, not only for the determination of
a fundamental meridian for Australia, but also for
settling some delicate questions with regard to the
motions of the moon. The observations in this depart-
ment have been continued partly at the suggestion
of Professor Newcomb, of Washington. The observed
occupations from 1873 to 1876 were utilized by Pro-


fessor Anwers in 1884 for the determination of a
fundamental meridian for Australia, and those from
1864 to 1870 just recentlyeby Dr. Clemens. The dis-
cussion of the series for 1864-70 forms an inaugural
dissertation read before the University of Gottingen.
Although the data for these two discussions were
obtained with the earlier and comparatively imperfect
instrumental means, their extraordinary accuracy has
been amply attested by the authors. Mr. Tebbutt?s
observations will, therefore, in the future, be regarded
as a fundamental point in the Australian system of
triangulation. His comet work, too, finds a place in
several well-known astronomical monographs, and in
this connection it may be stated that he is the recog-
nised discoverer of two of the grandest and most
remarkable comets of the 19th century. One of them,
namely that of 1861, was discovered by him six weeks
before it was observed in Europe, and he was able,
by the mathematical knowledge which he had at that
time acquired, to compute the orbit and predict the
earth?s close approach to the tail, a prediction which
was subsequently verified. The other great comet, that
of 1881, is referred to by Miss Agnes M. Clarke in
her fine work on the ?History of Astronomy during
the 19th Century,? as a very important one. Come-
tary photography, she says, came to its earliest fruition
with it, and cometary spectroscopy made a notable
advance by means of it. A just idea of Mr. Tebbutt?s
connection with cometary astronomy may, perhaps,
best be found by consulting a work by Dr. J. S. Gallas.
edition 1894. Concurrently with his astronomical
work he has carried on meteorological observations.
His work in this department from 1863 to 1890 has
been published in six parts and distributed. Six
years? more work remains to be published, and these
will then be available data extending over 35 years
for investigating the climate of Windsor.?




THE BLACK HORSE HOTEL, RICHMOND.
First licensed, February 20, 1819.


A FAMOUS OLD FAMILY.
A VERY pretty little village is Clydesdale, situated
on South Creek, four or five miles out of Windsor
and reached in about 20 minutes from Riverstone
station, on the Windsor and Richmond line. The
seat of the Hassall family for many years was at
erkshire Park, on the Windsor side of South Creek
and there Rowland, Jonathan and Charles of that
name were, reared, if not born. It is worthy of
note that many of our well-known pastoralists were
born on, or near the Hawkesbury: the Hassalls, the
Rouses, the Fitzgeralds, the Richards, the Bow-
mans, the Coxes?all known in the north-west as
sheep-breeders and graziers. The home of the
Hassalls at the Berkshire Park was known as
Jerusalem ; across the road is ?Jericho,? formerly
owned by Mr. George Rouse, of Biraganbil, but
latterly by Mr. John Bowlin, who married a Miss
Hassall. Mr. Bowlin?s father was for manv years
Air. Rouse s overseer, and eventually became owner
oi the property-left to him, I believe, by his old
employer. There was also another marriage
between the Hassalls ,and Bowlins, Jonathan Hassall
} (T thl 1 n having married a Miss Bowlin. Young
' Jack ? Bowlin?cricketer and sportsman--carried
matters further by marrying, as I have said, the re-
maining Miss Hassall, who was considered ?worth a
plum.? ?Jack,? in his youthful days was for a
time at Guntawang (Mr. Richard Rouse?s) as store-
keeper havmg served his time with Robert Dick,
of Windsor. ? Jack ? didn?t live long after his father
however, and Jericho? went to his widow the
one-time heiress of ?Jerusalem.? Old Mrs. Hassall
was a grand old lady?l remember her well?and
she ruled ?Jerusalem? for many a year with a
pretty firm hand. She had learned experience in
her husband s time, when convict servants were the


order of the day, and there are many evidences of
their handiwork at ?Jerusalem? to this day, to say
nothing of some very ?tall? stories, which may, or
may not, be legendary. At any rate, sitting round
the"big hall fire at ?Jerusalem,? I have heard not a
few bloodcurdling stories concerning convicts being
locked in a cellar ?said cellar is now in good condi-
tion, and has more recently been used for the storage
of bottled ?blue devils.? But whether said con-
vict?s skeleton was found or not, whether his
ghost walked o? nights in chains, or another was
found drowned in the creek which runs at the
bottom of the orchard, I know not. I never saw
either, though, in the midnight watches, while sleep-
ing over the cellar, I have been expecting them.
Yes, ?Jerusalem? is a delightful old place in day-
light; but lying in bed o? nights, fully primed with
ghost lore and reminiscences of the ?good old days,?
things are a bit ?unked,? as they say in old Berk-
shire. And now we learn that Mr. Rowland Hassall
visits Dubbo at the grand old age of 78 years. Why,
it seems but a few years ago that I saw his mother,
with her snowy white head, at ?Jerusalem.? I
know she was over 80 at her death, though her
daughter (Mrs. John Bowlin) was a comparatively
young woman, being the youngest of the family. A
younger son (Charles) was drowned at Guntawang
many years ago. He was on a visit to his kinsmen
when the sad occurrence took place. The river was
in fresh at the time, and the young man plunged in
to save a Chinaman, and sacrificed his own life
in the attempt. There was another venerable man
bearing the same name, the Rev* Mr. Hassall, who
died at Berrima many years ago. Probably he was
a brother of the Clydesdale Hassall, and, if so,
therefore uncle to Rowland and Jonathan. The old
clergyman, I remember, was in his 90th year. Verily
are the Hassalls a long-lived race, and I have no
reason to believe that they owed their stature,


stamina, and longevity to the principles of total
abstinence, or, in fact, to abstention from sport or
dangerous pastime or occupation. They came of a
good old stock; their father was one of the pioneers
of the colony with the gutters, Rouses', and Lawsons
and when their days shall be numbered they will
leave behind them many stalwart members of the
third and four generations to perpetuate the grand
old name of Hassall. CCJ

A DIAMOND WEDDING


Mr. Gosper?s parents were amongst the earliest
settlers on the Colo, and it is understood that his
father had a substantial grant of land from the
Crown in that locality. At that period native blacks
were numerous and aggressive, and,, cut off to a big
extent from communication with the outside world,
the Gospers, in common with neighboring settlers,
did not find life altogether a bed of roses in the
sylvan Colo valley. Mrs. Gosper?s father, the late
Captain Thomas Christy, was a Norwegian by birth,
and came to Australia in the early thirties of last
century, travelling by the vessel Royal Oak.
Eventually he settled at Lower Portland, where he
married a daughter of the late Michael Lamb and
reared a large family of sons and daughters. Only
a little while back, a son-in-law and daughter, Mr.
and Mrs. C. E. Kohlhoff, of Neutral Bay, celebrated
their golden wedding. Incidentally, the late Cap-
tain Christy was one of the earliest traders on the
Hawkesbury, navigating his own vessel between the
river and Sydney, and was for a period captain of
the ?Huntress,? one of the first steamers to trade
between Windsor and Sydney. He was also the
first farmer on the Hawkesbury to plant an orange
orchard, which he did on his property at Lower
Portland, naming it ?Orange Grove.?
In celebration of their diamond wedding, Mr. and
Mrs. Gosper entertained upwards of sixty relatives
and friends at their residence on Saturday, October
8 The supper tables were tastefully decorated
with sweet peas, lilies, and ferns, the whole pre-
senting a very pleasing appearance. A number ot
speeches appropriate to the occasion were made, and
heaps of good wishes were showered on the old
couple, who have trod life?s thorny path so long
together. Although Mr. and Mrs. Gosper have both
passed the eightieth mile-stone on life?s road, they
still enjoy a dance, and after the room had been
cleared, the old couple led off with the ancient


?country dance,? which proved something of a
novelty to most of the guests present. A thoroughly
enjoyable evening was spent by everyone present at
the unique function, which was brought to a close
by much hand-shaking, congratulations, expressions
of goodwill, and the singing of ?Auld Lang Syne.?
Mr. and Mrs. Gosper received many useful presents,
several cheques among them. The family of Mr.?
and Mrs. Gosper consists of four sons and one
daughter living, and there are twenty grandchildren
and a number of great-grandchildren.
FIRST EIGHT-HOUR DAY.
?D.P.? (in the Bulletin ), recalls that the first
mention of an eight-hour day in Australia was in
a general order issued by Governor Hunter on
January 11, 1797. It dealt with the making of the
road from Sydney to the Hawkesbury, and ended:
The labourers are to continue at their work eight
hours each working day.?
EARLY SHIPPING REGULATIONS.
blE Sydney Gazette and New South Adver-
tiser,? which was published by authority, first saw
the light on Saturday, March 5, 1803, and was
printed at the young settlement of Sydney as a
four-page weekly budget of news and advertise-
ments for the benefit and advancement of the in-
habitants.
In this first issue, and appearing under '?General
Orders? (signed by W. N. Chapman, secretary to the
Governor, Captain P. G. King, R.N.), the public
boatmen, plying with produce between the Hawkes-
bury and Sydney, are thus addressed:
?Repeated complaints having been made of the
great losses sustained by the settlers at Hawkesbury
from the vexatious conduct of the boatmen by whom


they send their grain to Sydney, the following
regulations are to be observed: ?
?Every person sending grain from the Hawkes-
bury to Sydney in an open boat, or a boat that is
not trustworthy, the magistrates are directed to
take no notice thereof.
?If on proof it appears that the master of a boat
receives more grain than the vessel ought to take with
safety, the master shall make good any quantity he
may throw overboard, or otherwise damage, lose the
freight of that part, and, on conviction before two
magistrates, forfeit �5, to the Orphan Fund.
?If it should appear to the magistrates that gram
coming round to Sydney has been wetted, that it
might weigh heavier or measure more than the
quantity put on board, the master will, on convic-
tion, forfeit �5, to the Orphan Fund.
?The Commanding; Officer of the New South wales
Corps will direct the Corporal of the Guard on
board the Castle of Good Hope to read the Geneial
Orders that are marked off in the extracts he is
furnished with, to the Corporal, and the party that
relieves him; the said orders are also to be read to
the Guard on board the supply hulk. (Government
House, February 21, 1803).
?The receiving granaries at Parramatta and
Hawkesbury being filled with wheat which is spoil-
ing, no more can be taken in at those places until
further orders, except in payment for Government
debts, and the whaler?s investments lodged in the
public stores.?
POETS AND THE HAWKESBURY.
A CORRESPONDENT sends us the followingJ.
Sheridan Moore, an Australian poet, residing in New
South Wales, published a small volume of his lyrics
in 1864. In?the preface, amongst his apologies;to
his readers for publishing his rhymes, he complains


of would-be poets stealing his compositions and
claiming them as their own, and also says: ?I was
further induced to take the course I have followed
m consequence of the recent reproduction in an
obscure sectional weekly newspaper of an illiberal
criticism by Mr. Charles Harpur, on one of my
poems, a criticism which I hope that gentleman will
yet have the honesty and manliness to modify and
which I am sure the public will never endorse.?
Amongst J. Sheridan Moore?s effusions is one of
a local character:?
THE MAID OF WINDSOR.
Dear Maid of Windsor, though we part,
And all the sunshine of the heart
Fades like the morning?s purple flush,
Or evening?s evanescent blush.
Though fated thus our lives to sever.
Still, dearest girl, forget me never!
And should, hereafter, others name
Thy peerless graces, ?Tnd proclaim
Such deep regard as mine has been? '
Still on me look with soul serene;
though absent, on me smile as ever?
And, dearest girl, forget me never!
Although we break the mystic link,
And Hopes amid life?s shadows sink;
Though Love no more, with flashing wing,
Shall round us bright enthralment fling?
Still do not in affection waver?
Oh, dearest girl, forget me never!
Ah, let one spot in Life?s bleak waste,
Like some bright isle in dark seas pl^ed,
With gilded raem?ries be o?ercast?
Reflections of the golden Past,
My soul still holds the bliss you gave her ?
My own dear girl, forget it never !
. Roderick J- Flanagan, the well-known Australian
journalist, poet, and author of ?Aborigines of Aus-


tralia,? composed the following poem, also of a
local character: ?
TO THE RIVER HAWKESBURY.
Majestic flood, that glid?st mid shading trees
Seeking, like rarest good, a course unseen,
How rich a lesson may the rnuser glean
From out thy heaven-writ page! In thee he sees
A pilgrim that for ages held thy way,
Blessing the land, when none did mark thy wave
Save tribes unwitting of the good ye gave,
Waiting with patience the all-welcome day
When happy homes should line thy bounteous banks,
And maids, like Mary Anne, should bide
Amid thy vales, and in thy sunny tide
Mirror their graceful forms. Thus yielding thanks
For ev?ry fleeting joy, the true hearts know
No change, let sadness come or fortune?s favors flow.
Douglas B. W. Sladen, an Australian colonist
(Melbourne) and poet, who has published several
of his effusions, in one of his works, ?In Cornwall
and across the Sea,? gives one of his compositions
of a local character, and one which has never been
noticed locally. It is as follows:
AT WINDSOR, N.S.W., IN WINTER.
There?s a reek from the stalks of the Indian corn
As they stand in their blazing sheaves,
There?s a freshening breeze from the uplands borne,
And a rustle of pelting leaves,
Which will bound in a moment across the lea,
Like the flattest of pebbles thrown
For a duck and a drake on the summer sea
By the children at Brighthelmstone.*
Were it not for the smoke from the stalks of corn
And the scent from the orange trees,
And the white-gums whose sober-hued tresses scorn
The chill and the toss of the breeze;
Were it not for the wattle with golden plume,
And the she-oak with plaintive moan,
I could fancy that I was beside the tomb
Of my mother at Brighthelmstone.


Ice! the trees which are shedding are English trees,
But they grow not in English land,
And the wind has the breath of an English breeze,
-But it tastes not of Sussex sand,
And the heavens in winter had ne?er the hue
And a sun such as this ne?er shone,
And the scent on the orange bloom never blew
In the gardens of Brighthelmstone.
It is merry the glow of an Austral morn
And the sun in its winter sky;
And the green of the burgeoning Indian corn
Is a glory on earth to eye;
Biit as oft as I wander and weave my sons?
On the balmiest day alone,
For a moment I wish that I roamed along
On the beaches of Brighthelmstone.
Saxon name for Brighton, England.
?DICK DRIVER.?
S Hawbesbur y people will remember genial
D k (a 2 he was familiar ly called) for many
years Member for Windsor and Richmond
obs( T e . ?rner, is an altar monument,
almost covered with wild brush, upon which read
name well-known in Sydney some years ao-o It
covers the famity vault of the Driver family
Richard Driver, senr, a native of the colony, kept
the public house known as The Three Tuns, at the
corner of King and Elizabeth streets, where now
stands Temple Court. Before the old-fashioned
house gave way in 1875 to the ?Court,? the legend
Richard Driver, licensed to retail malt and
spirituous liquors,? was visible on the lintel over
the quaint fan-light, although the house had years
before ceased to provide ?entertainment? either for
man or beast,? and the painter?s brush had made
many efforts to wipe the lettering out. Richard
junior, Dickey Driver,? politician and sportsman?
used to be very vain of the fact that though born


find reared in a public-house he had never known
the taste of intoxicating liquors. On the tomb of the
elder Driver the record is incomplete, the family
evidently being very uncertain as to dates:
RICHARD DRIVER, SENR.
Died 186
Aged years.
Some sixty years have elapsed since Richard
Driver senr., went the way of all flesh, and the
blanks are not yet filled in. In this vault are his
sons George, who died aged 29 years, and Harry,
a solicitor, for some time practising in Bathurst who
also died in his prime. Richard, junr., is not found
here, but occupies a space under a handsome monu-
ment at Waverley?the Kensal Green of Sydney.
Richard Driver, junr., was born at ?CoMah ? near
Liverpool, New South Wales, on September 16, 1829,
before (it will be noted) his father came into Sydney
to occupy the Three Tuns Tavern, on the corner of
Hunter and Phillip streets. ?Dicky,? as he was
familiarly known by his chums, was articled to
George Robert Nichols, well known in legal and
political circles, and a member of the First Mmisto
under Responsible Government. He was admitted
to practice in 1856, and was subsequently appointed
solicitor to the Sydney Corporation, his legal mentor
G R Nichols, having been the first solicitor to that
bodv. Mr. Driver entered the Legislative Assembly
as member for West Macquarie in iB6O, afterwards
successively representing Carcoar and Windsor He
carried the Game Act, and was Minister for Bands in
the Parkes Government, March to August, 1877.
He was for some time Chairman of Committees.
He was scorer for the mother colony m the
early inter-colonial cricket matches, was umpire in
most of the big aquatic races, was chairman of


TattersaU?s Club, and judge at many race, meetings.
Un the cricket field his services as umpire were in
trequent demand. Notwithstanding the fact that
Mr Driver was reared in a public-house, was in
ai liament, was connected with every phase of sport
and mixed with all classes in the community in the
courts and in the Corporation?he was ?a ? life
abstainer from intoxicants. He died in 1880
We are reminded of an anecdote of Richard
Driver, junr., which savors somewhat of Sam Weller
He was cross-examining a little girl in a case at
tfie Water Police Court, and had reason to believe
she had been tutored. ??Now, my dear,? said
Dickey m his most insinuating manner, ?didn?t your
mother say something to yon before yon came into
Court?? ?Yes, sir.? ?Ah! I thought so,? said
the satisfied Dick. ?Now what did she tell you??
She told me I was to tell the truth, no matter
who asked me.? Driver admitted that he collapsed
at the answer, and lost his case.
Apropos the pioneering family of John Driver the
following interesting communication clears up the
apparent mystery of the two Richard Drivers, and
bears out the contention that they were one and the
same. A correspondent?s letter shows the correct-
ness, in his historical matters, of inviting comment
and criticism. In this particular I (?Old Chum ?
m Sydney ?Truth?), may quote what Mr. Edmund
Finn, of Melbourne, stated when he issued his
Chionieles of Early Melbourne, ?? thirty years?
-1835 to 1850.
Originally I had intended to publish the ?Chronicles? in
book form, but reflection led me to deem it more advisable
to issue it in sections through the press to the public,
inviting the freest criticism and the correction of possible,?
though inadvertent, inaccuracies, and promising, in the
not improbable event of its re-issue in a collected shape,
to benefit by the same so far as I could after careful in-
vestigation. My purpose in adopting this course was to


render my effort worthy of the cause in which it was
accomplished, and to make it a reliable record of byegone
times.
?July 26, 1911.?Dear Sir?ln your issue of the
23rd instant you mention there being another
Richard Driver, contemporary with ?Ye Dick of the
Three Tuns.? Allow me to inform you that they
were one and the same person. Your statement is
wrong that Mr. Richard Driver, senr., was son-in-
law to Mr. Henry Marr. After the death of John
Driver, in 1810, his widow, Elizabeth Driver, became
the wife of Mr. Henry Marr, therefore Richard
Driver, senr., was his stepson. On the death of Mr.
Driver?s mother, Mr. Marr married a Mrs. Wood,
who survived him. Mr. Richard Driver, senr., mar-
ried a daughter of one of the first pioneers, Mr,
Edward Powell. Her name was Elizabeth, and she
was born in 1805, near Richmond, N.S.W., her father
having a grant of land on the banks of the Hawkes-
bury River. Their eldest son was the late Richard
Driver, M.L.A., a well-known solicitor in Sydney,
and identified with all branches of sport. The lady
mentioned in your article as residing in a western
suburb was my late aunt, Miss Elizabeth Driver,
eldest daughter of Richard Driver, senr. She died
six years ago. I have never heard my grandmother
or aunt mention that the old homfe at the corner
of King and Elizabeth streets was formerly the
property of solicitor Norton. When occupied by my
grandfather it was the property of his sister, Mrs.
Reid, of Hobart Town, Tasmania, it having been part
of her dowry. As I am the daughter of the late
Henry Driver, solicitor, who was the youngest son
of Richard Driver, senr., the above statements are
well authenticated.?Yours, etc., 8.E.A.?


NEARLY 60 YEARS AGO.
The following advertisement appeared in the
Sydney Morning Herald? of February 21, 1854:
HAWKE SB URY RlVER?Farms and Flour Mill.
Mort and Co. have received instructions to sell by public
auction, at their Rooms, Pitt-street, THIS DAY the 21st
February, at 11 o?clock.
Three small Farms and Flour Mill, situate on the River
Hawkesbury, near Wiseman?s Ferry.
%/
I.
The Farm called ?Milton,? situate on Myrtle Creek and
ie Hawkesbury, consisting of 50 acres, mostly under cul-
tivation, together with the tidal Flour Mill at present in the
occupation of Mr. Charles Douglass. There is a substantial
stone-built two-story Dwelling House upon this property,
dole to the mill, which is well known as one of the best
employed on the river, and might, under enterprising man-
agement and a moderate expenditure, be made capable of
doing much more than double its present work. The close
proximity of this mill to the Hawkesbury and to the Mac-
donald Rivers, together with the now near prospect of a
regular steam communication being established between
Sydney and Windsor by the Hawkesbury, will unquestion-
ably cause a great advance in the value- of all property in
that quarter. r t- j
2.
.The Farm in the occupation of James Foody, situate on
the Hawkesbury, a few miles below the last described farm,
consisting of about 120 acres on the banks of the riA'er
(opposite to Asterly?s Mill), nearly all cleared, and a good
portion in cultivation, with a comfortable Dwelling House
and other suitable buildings, recently erected, close to the
river; also 40 acres detached from, but in the immediate
neighbourhood of, the last mentioned portion of the farm,
ibis is a very valuable piece of land, both on account of its
quality for cultivation, and because it secures a large extent
of pasturage in a secluded and picturesque valley terminat-
mg in Gundeman?s Creek.
3.
The small' Farm known as the ?Millbight,? near Wise-
man s Ferry; it consists of 10 acres of the richest and most
pioductive land on the banks of the Hawkesbury, having a
stream of excellent fresh water running round it on one
side. It is a beautiful spot, and well worthy of the at-
tention of country tradesmen or others looking out for a
desirable place either to carry on business or for retire-


merit, in a pleasant neighbourhood, within a few hours?
sail of Sydney. There are several fine old and productive
pear trees on this property. �
Terms at sale.
THE WAREHOUSE WOMAN.
Conspicuous among the first traders of Australia,
in the historic records, appears the name of Mrs.
Mary Reibey. She reached Sydney during the
regime of Governor Hunter, in the Royal Admiral,
and soon took up business somewhere near the head
of the Tank Stream. She was but 20 years of age
when she opened a general store in one of the rude
structures with the poor furniture that the working
people then had. By indefatigable industry and
good fortune she soon acquired considerable
property.
There were then few merchants in Sydney, and
many of the military officers held a stern monopoly
of the Government stores, and in a high-handed way
kept the sale of goods entirely under their own
control.
About this time there arrived in Sydney Captain
Thomas Reibey, who brought out a cargo of mer-
chandise in his own vessel, and it was whilst doing
business with the pioneer lady trader that he was
so struck by her personality that he asked her to
be his wife, and an arrangement was made for him
to keep the coastal trade whilst she kept the store
in Sydney. Thus Miss Mary Haydock, daughter of
James Haydock, yeoman, of Ipswich, became Mrs.
Reibey, the marriage being performed by the Rev
Richard Johnson, assisted by the Rev. Samuel Mars-
den. Reibey lane is the locality where their ware-
house stood, between Pitt Street and Macquarie
Place, still called by that name. Very soon a new
store was put up, being more commodious, in order
to take in the provisions which the captain brought
in his regular trips to the Hawkesbury River?the
granary of the young colony. Near by was Simeon


Lord?s Store; Andrew Thompson also had a ware-
house, and Francis Cox had a smithy. The Raven
and the James (Captain Reibey?s vessels) made trips
not only up the Hawkesbury, but as far as the
Hunter River, for coals and timber; but unfor-
tunately the James was wrecked (1804) near Broken
Ba y ? w hen the captain and crew walked from the
scene of the wreck to North Head, without food,
and only imperfectly protected from the weather!
Mrs. Reibey meantime went on with the trade in
Sydney, getting in 1807 six shillings an ounce for
tea, and six shillings a pound for butter. Tobacco
was twenty-four shillings a pound, coarse white
calico five shillings a yard, men?s hats three guineas,
sugar four shillings a pound, soap three shillings a
pound, men s boots from two to three pounds a
paii, molasses ten shillings a gallon, and so on in
proportion.
DEATH OF A PIONEER.
MRS. R. SMALL, whose death at the age of 92
years, took place in 1921, was a member of one of
the oldest families in Australia.
Her grandfather, Mr. John Small, accompanied
by his wife, arrived by H.M.S. Sirius, in 1788, as a
military officer and doctor?s dispenser, and later
attended on Governor Phillip. Shortly after the
arrival of the ?first fleet,? the wife of Mr. John
Small gave birth to the first white girl born in Aus-
tralia?the late Mrs. Oakes, of Parramatta.
The late Mrs. Small was bom at Richmond in
1828, and was a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Matthew
Hughes. Mr. Hughes was an early schoolmaster, and
was connected with St. Peter?s Church of England.
His name occurs frequently in connection with most
of the doings in Richmond in the early days. Her
mother was a sister of the late Mrs. Oakes?her
maiden name being Mary Small.
Mrs. Small?s father was connected with the


pioneering history of Richmond, and for many years
filled the position of schoolmaster to the children of
pioneers? families. The late Mrs. Small married a
cousin, Mr. Robert Small, who ultimately became
cashier of His Majesty?s Customs, and predeceased
his wife 12 years ago.
Mrs. Small, who lived for many years at Ryde, and
later at Willoughby, has left a family of two sons
and four daughters, including Mrs. J. B. Youdale,
Mrs. J. W. Moore, Mrs. J. Scott, Mrs. A. H, Ford,
and Messrs. Charles Robert and Arthur W. Small.
At the time of her death there w r ere also 30 grand-
children, and 32 great-grandchildren.
THE SCHOOL-HOUSE AT WILBERFORCE.
During 1817 Governor Macquarie decided to build four houses that
were to be used as schools, with accommodation for the master and his
family, and Divine Service, according to the usages of the Church of
England, was to be conducted in the school-room until such time as a
church was erected. These church-school houses were built in Richmond,
Castlereagh, Liverpool and Wilberforce, and of these only that at
Wilberforce remains. It was opened in 1821, and it is still well
preserved. Adjoining is the old cemetery containing the graves of
many pioneers.


OLDEST BUILDING.
SETTLEMENT in Australia was scarcely ten years
old when a building which has recently been swept
away to make room for a concrete cottage with a
galvanised iron roof, was put up. This is the old
Government cottage at Windsor, on the Hawkesbury,
probably the oldest building in the Commonwealth,
which dated back to the 18th century.
The old house is mentioned by Governor Hunter in
a list, drawn up in 1800, of buildings erected since
October, 1796. It is described as a framed and
weather-boarded house on the Green Hills (re-named
Windsor by Macquarie in 1811), for the residence
of the commanding officer of the district. It was
shingled, and had a cellar (an elaborate affair, with
12 wine-bins), a ??skilling kitchen,? and other
accommodation.
In 1806 Charles Grimes, the Surveyor-General, re-
ported that the cottage was in decay, a sweeping
statement, since, with a few repairs from time to
time, it continued to be inhabited till a few years
ago. Ellis Bent, the first lawyer appointed as Judge-
Advocate in New South Wales, died in the cottage
in 1815, and it was there, on September 27, 1819, that
Governor Macquarie first met Commissioner Bigge,
who was to report so adversely on Macquarie?s rule.
The house and the ground around it remained the
property of the Crown till 1855, when the place was
sold.
The old cottage went back to the days when red
cedar, now nearly extinct, was common and cheap
on the Hawkesbury. The weatherboards and interior
fittings, and even, it is said, the flooring boards,
were of splendid cedar. When the place was pulled
down the cedar was in an excellent state of preser-
vation.


THE OLD FITZROY BRIDGE OVER THE
SOUTH CREEK, WINDSOR.
THE bridge over South Creek was well known to
travellers of fifty years ago, being on the main road
from Sydney to Windsor. Of the structure depicted?*
Mr. John Tebbutt of the Observatory, Windsor,
writes; ??The first bridge erected across the South
Creek at Windsor was a very low one, only a few
feet above the level of the stream. It was about
100 yards further down the creek than that now
known as the Fitzroy bridge. I do not myself
remember that bridge but I often heard my father
talk about it. The logs which formed part of the
structure are still to be seen projecting from the
northern bank. A high levSl bridge was subse-
quently erected on the site of the present structure.
This must have been before I was born in 1834, for I
can remember it as far back as 1840. All the traffic
passed across it from Sydney, Parramatta, Pitt Town,
etc., and I well remember that in the early forties
myself and companions used to cross this bridge to
meet detachments of the regular soldiers who were
sent from Sydney to occupy our local barracks. I
well remember the 50th, 58th, 80th, and other regi-
ments, which were quartered here, for you must re-
member that Windsor was then a garrison town.
The modern police station is really the original bar-
racks with very slight alterations. The walls sur-
rounding it are only about half as high as they were
in the days of the military. I have several mementoes
in connection with those days. I can remember that
in the forties the bridge just referred to was called
Howe?s bridga, named, I believe, after the well-
known Government Printer of the early days. It
is referred to in the ?New South Wales Post Office
Directory,? copies of which for 1833, 1834, and 1835
are in my library. The original Howe Bridge


became so dilapidated that it was considered
advisable to erect a new one on its site. The new
bridge was named ?Fitzroy Bridge,? after the
well-known Governor of the colony, so that the name
Howe disappeared. This new bridge became in its
turn unsuitable for traffic and the present iron bridge
was substituted for it and retained the name of Fitz-
roy down to the present date.?
THE ARNDELLS.
MISS SOPHIE ARNDELL was one of the third
generation from Dr. Thomas Arndell, who came out
as surgeon with Governor Phillip in the First Fleet.
She was the second of three unmarried Misses Arn-
dell, daughters of Thomas Arndell the Second, who
had for 'some years, lived in Lewisham, but who
were born at the original family estate of Cattai,
Hawkesbury River, where her grandfather retired
and farmed in the disturbed times of the Bligh
rebellion. Like many others of the original
Hawkesbury settlers, the Arndells have spread far
and wide over the continent of Australia, and
two of the brothers of the deceased lady were among
the pioneer squatters of the Upper Hunter River
district, Blandford, owing the large estate of Glendhu
station, whilst the eldest brother, Thomas, re-
mained in the old homestead at Cattai Creek.
Miss Arndell?s sisters were, besides two unmarried,
Mrs. George Loder (who died many years ago), of
Abbey Green, Singleton, and Mrs.. F. R. White, of
Harben Yale, Blandford. Whilst the deceased lady
had for many years lived a very retired life, she and
her sisters were among the cultured women of early
times on the Hawkesbury, and in a quiet way did
much good in the district. When her brother mar-
ried Miss Mary Hall, of Macquarie, the next large
estate, the family separated, and soon Mr. Arndell?s
large family filled the old home. Miss Sophie


Arndell reached the venerable age of 80 years, her
home at Petersham being the central meeting for
members of the large clan that has sprung from the
original pioneer settler and first medical doctor on
the Hawkesbury. ?No family,? says a writer on
the old times, ?has so closely preserved the traditions
of the old timers as have the Arndells. ? Of the
brother, Thomas, of the late Miss Arndell, when he
died, on October 30, 1907, it as said ?no name is
more honoured, not only in the Hawkesbury, but in
the whole State, than Arndell. A man with very
large sympathies for his fellow-men, springing from
a family strong in their faith as uncompromising
Presbyterians, a man who lived a moral life and was
upright in all his doings. What wonder that such
a man was beloved and honoured and venerated!?
What was said of her brother Thomas was also
applicable to Miss Sophie. ?Her life was gentle and
simple, with kindliness and courtesy to all,? said
one who knew her. We are fast losing the men and
women who knew the land in its primitive pioneer
days, and there is a little pull at our heart strings
every time one passes away. Intimately associated
with this family were the Threlkelds, a daughter of
the original Thomas Arndell, physician, magistrate,
wool and wheat grower, and Imperial Government
official, being married to the Rev. Mr. Threlkeld, the
missionary, in the Port Macquarie district, also the
pioneer preacher for the Sailors? Homie, and the
first resident teacher and clergyman in the Old
South Head church, now pulled down. Mrs. Threl-
keld was a splendid helpmate to her husband, both
in family and public life; and the descendants of
these two fine old families are many, still keeping
in close touch with each other. It is a matter of
interest that the family of the original Arndell had
as a tutor no less a person than the notorious James
Hardy Vaux, forger, etc., who spent years of his life
in Australia.


OLD EBENEZER CHURCH.
AT the 1900 annual celebration of the anniversary
of Ebenezer Church (built in 1808), a patriarch
from Tamworth, Mr. Alex. Johnston, told the story
of his old days in simple but touching fashion, and
a deep silence fell upon the people present, many
of whom heard again a deal about their ancestors.
He said: ?
?My mother was born at Wilberforce in 1808. I first
saw the Hawkesbury about 1837. Born in Sydney, my
parents, knowing Teacher Anderson, sent my brother and
self up to Ebenezer, and we were under the care of Mr.
Anderson?s sister, Mrs. Stevenson. Sydney in those days
was not a desirable place for boys?and I don?t think it is
now. The river in those days was teeming with fish-
perch, sprat, mullet, and the little gudgeon; and in the bush
birds abounded in great numbers ?parrots, bronzewing
pigeons, quail, and several sorts of wild duck. I have
seen the lagoons covered with thousands of them. One
man, named Devine, who used to send game to Sydney,
lived near the old Ebenezer Church. He killed and
wounded 32 ducks at one shot; every grain of shot must
have told, firing into so many birds. The blacks in those
days were numerous and quiet; they had a favorite cave
between the church and adjoining farm (Darby Ryan?s).
Several ministers from Sydney used to officiate at Ebenezer
?Rev. Dr. Lang among them. The attendance was fairly
good, people coming in boats, carts, and on horseback, and
a few in the old-fashioned vehicle?the gig?coming dis-
tances from 6 to 10 miles. The old church was partitioned
with cedar ?half as church and school; the other parts were
converted into two rooms, and the lower-floor room was our
dining room ?while the upper floor, which was about five
feet to the ceiling, was a bedroom for two little girls and
our housekeeper, Mrs. Stevenson. We boys (five of us),
and the teacher, slept in the church and on the dining-
room floor ?no bedsteads. The church in those days had
two large side doors, one facing the river and the other
exactly opposite. We had no clock or watch; when the
sun?s rays showed a certain distance inside the door we
knew it was dinner time, and in the evening by the same
wav we knew when to close school. In dull or rainy
weather, sometimes the children would set out for home an


hour later, not knowing the time. Very few of my school-
mates are left?some of their names I noticed yesterday
on the tombstones, which caused a feeling of sadness. I
always feel a wish to view the old place on the 26th Janu-
ary. One year I travelled 700 miles (from Tamworth and
back) to attend one of the meetings at the old church.
One of my schoolmates (Richards) worked his way up and
was Government Printer. He was well known to several
of the old families on the river. We (us boarders) had a
pretty rough time, and I still retain a very kindly feeling
towards those families who used to bring us fruit, etc.,
more especially the Messrs. Arndell, Johnston, and Hall.
We had our droughts in those days, as well as our big
floods. I well remember, we had to cut down the wild
apple tree and the river oak for the stock; and the cattle,
where possible, would walk into the river and feed on the
weeds, many of them bogging and dying in the water. I
notice the river in some parts is very shallow now. In
places where good sized steamers used to ply, the sand is
visible, more especially about Pitt Town. At holiday
season the boys walked up to Windsor, 8 miles from Eben-
ezer, and took the coach to Sydney. Some of the older resi-
dents will remember the old schoolmaster?s sister, Mrs.
Stevenson. She went as nurse to Mrs. T, G. Wilson?s
family at Port Macquarie, and lived with them for about 30
years. She died at the age of 84, and was buried in the
Port Macquarie cemetery.
STRANGE SPORTS OF THE EARLY DAYS.
FROM time immemorial (to use a colloquialism)
sport has been worshipped on the Hawkesbury with
a devotion and zest now proverbial. The denizens
of the fertile valley (a race of athletes, by the way)
have excelled in the arena of sport, by flood on field,
until the traditions of the locality point to the fact
that champions have been as prevalent as they have
been persevering. No matter what the sport, money
was freely staked on the contingencies, incidental
thereto. What may be termed ?legitimate? sport,
such as horse racing, cricket, pugilism, pedestrianism,
rowing, etc., was wooed with much ardour, and the
names of ?Jorroeks? (the hero of a hundred fights


on the racecourses of the colony), Kable, Norris,
Dalton, Carver, Bushell, Kemp, and many others
are still as familiar as household words. One of the
first big matches ever run between two racehorses
in this State took place ?on Dargin?s course Claren-
don, and the old-time jockey, Johnny Higgerson,
played a prominent part in the evenf, which was
for �lOOO, and between Bessy Bedlam and
Theorem. The former, winning two out of three
heats, appropriated the stake for her owner, Mr.
Richard Rouse. Mr. W. H. Sutter, of Bathurst,
owned Theorem, and large numbers from all parts of
of the colony witnessed the race. This was in the
good old days, before there was railway communica-
tion between the district and the metropolis, when
money was plentiful, spent improvidently, and
seldom or never mourned over wdien once lost. In
fact, anything by which money could be won or
lost found favour with the ?old sports.? For
instance, for large wagers men would undertake
to roll against each other (lying prone upon the
ground), or they would ensconce themselves in
empty casks and roll one against the other, starting
from an eminence in each case, the bottom of the
hill being the winning post. They would run races
carrying pumpkins on their heads; run races carry-
ing men or boys, as the ease might be, upon their
backs. The game of ?chalking? was very popular.
Strong men would undertake to carry on their backs
corn sacks full of sand certain distances for
heavy bets. They would swing from, horizontal bars,
the one jumping thus the greatest distance winning
the stake. ' Another fad was to see who could hang
the longest by the toes from a horizontal bar.
There was jumping from bottles, two being laid on
their sides on the ground with a board across them;
the bottles, of course, had a tendency to roll from
under the feet of the competitors, and it required
great agility to accomplish a jump from such a


starting point, 2ft being considered a record jump.
Then men would engage to carry a sledge hammer
(with a nail driven in the end of the handle), the
head of the hammer downwards, the nail to be held
only between the forefinger and thumb, and the feat
was to see who could carry the sledge in this way the
greatest distance in a given time. Another phase
of the sport of the time was for men to back them-
selves to stop on a cart wheel, having previously
placed themselves in position among the spokes,
hanging on by legs and arms while the horse in the
cart was driven, slow or fast, a certain distance.
All these and many other queer sports amused the
pioneers of the Hawkesbury, and as much as �5O
and �lOO would be frequently staked on the possi-
bilities of the ?event.? Wagering was even intro-
duced into the cricket field, matches never being
played under �1 per bat, and the losers, besides
forfeiting their stake, to provide a dinner at night
for both teams. Single wicket matches (three a
side) have been played for as much as �5O a side.
HAWKESBURY BENEVOLENT SOCIETY
AND HOSPITAL.
FOLLOWING is a letter of interest as showing the
origin of a distinct institution which for many years
has accomplshed work of incalculable value to the
State: ?
Chief Secretary?s Office,
Sydney, 17th August, 1909.
Sir, ?With reference to your letter of the 11th instant,
seeking information concerning the abovenamed Institu-
tion, I have the honour, by direction of the Chief Secretary,
to inform you that the papers in possession of this Depart-
ment show that in the year 1840 the ?Hawkesbury Benevo-
lent Society,? which had been established for some time
before at Windsor, and which had for its objects the re-
lief of sueh poor persons as through age, accident or in-


firmity were unable to support themselves, was incorporated
by Act 4 Yic. No. 3.
The following gentlemen were named in such Act as
Trustees for land belonging to the Society, viz.:
William Cox, Hobartville, Richmond.
Robert Fitzgerald, Windsor.
William Bowman, Richmond.
Thomas Tebbutt, Windsor.
John Macdonald, Pitt Town.
A provision in the Act which empowered the Trustees to
hold land granted by the Crown only (except what might
be absolutely required for the purpose of building a House
or Houses for receiving persons to be relieved by the
Society) was afterwards amended by an Act passed in
1860, styled an Act to amend the Hawkesbury Benevolent
Society?s Act of Incorporation, and the Society is thereby
authorised to hold other lands as well as grants by the
Crown. The Act first cited provides that vacancies in the
Trustees are to be filled by the Society at General Meeting.
If, however, the vacancies exist for an entire year, without
being filled as provided, the Governor is empowered to
appoint Trustees to the vacant positions from amongst the
Members of the Society. Under the original Act, it is
provided that the affairs of the Society shall be controlled
by a Committee of Management?elected annually, and
subject to the rules and by-laws of the Society?consist-
ing of a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer,
eight Members and the Trustees. By Act No. 7, 1903
(Hawkesbury Benevolent Society?s (Amendment) Act,
1903), two honorary medical officers, to be elected annually
as officers of the Society and Hospital, are added to the
constitution of the Committee of Management. This latter
enactment also provided that the Society should be known
in future as the ?Hawkesbury Benevolent Society and
Hospital,? and gives power to the Institution, with the
consent of the Minister, to sell and convey lands for the
benefit of the Society and Hospital.
The Trustees for the year 1909 are Messrs. R. M. Fitz-
gerald, S. T. Greenwell, J. J. Paine, J. B. Johnston, and
R. B. Walker.
It may be mentioned that in the year 1887, a pamphlet
entitled the ?History of the Hawkesbury Benevolent
Society? was published by Messrs. Turner and Henderson
for the Society. It is regretted that no copies thereof are
available in this Office, but it is suggested that you may be
able to obtain a copy upon application to the Secretary to

GRAVE-STONE OVER REMAINS OF JAMES RUSE
IN CAMPBELLTOWN CEMETERY.


the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society and Hospital ?Mr. R.
A. Pye, Windsor.
The Society appears to have been first started in Decem-
ber, 1818, but there are no papers in the Department prior
to its Incorporation in 1840 by Act 4 Vic., No. 3.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
J. GIBSON,
Under-Secretary.
J. C. L. Fitzpatrick, Esq., M.L.A.,
Parliament House.
JAMES RUSE.
First Hawkesbury Farmer.
AFTER several years of experience in farming about
the Parramatta district, James Ruse secured land
at Green Hills (Windsor) in 1791, his farm being on
the bank of South Creek, not far from its junction
with the Ilawkesbury.
The unique old picture of the grave headstone,
with its quaint old-fashioned lettering and queer
spelling, reproduced here is from the time-worn
slab of grey stone that stands as a finger-post?so
to speak?at the head of the tiny little patch that
holds the mortal remnants of the Cornishman,
Ruse, who sowed and harvested the first crop of
wheat in Australia. His yield on that ever-to-be-
remembered occasion was a moderate 600 bushels.
To-day the State of New South Wales (at that
period constituting Australia) shows a yield for its
year?s harvest (1905) of nearly 20 million bushels,
approximating in money no less than three million
pounds sterling.
Ruse was a ?first-fleeter,? and was quite a young
man when he came out, which will be understood
better when it is remembered that he enjoyed life
under the Southern Cross for 49 years. When laid
to rest in the Campbelltown (not Camperdown)
Cemetery in 1837, he was 77 years of age, which
would logically bring his age out as being 28 when he


landed. Governor Arthur Phillip had a great
opinion of him, as will appear later on. Ruse enjoys
the distinction of being the first free settler in Aus-
tralia, as well as holding the very rare honour
of being the first man to raise the ?staff of life?
from Australian soil.
True it is that Governors Phillip and Hunter both
had wheat sown prior to the practical work of Ruse;
but their efforts to mature the crops were all in
vain, and were almost productive of hopelessness.
However, it must be admitted that it was through
Phillip?s untiring efforts that the young settlement
was able to grow wheat in its tender infancy.
Extracts from his correspondence with the English
Government on the subject show that, and his appre-
ciation an humane patronage of Ruse is show in
official records of the day, which here follow:
PHILLIP AND ELSE.
?In order to know in what time a man might be able
to cultivate a sufficient quantity of ground to support
himself, I last November ordered a hut to be built in a
good situation, an acre of ground to be cleared, and, once
turned up, it was put into the possession of a very
industrious [person], who was told if he behaved well he
should have 30 acres. (This individual is James Ruse,
the first settler) He has been industrious, has
received some little assistance from time to time, and now
tells me that if one acre more is cleared for him he shall
be able to support himself after next January, which I
much doubt; but think he will do tolerably well after
he has been supported for 18 months. Others may prove
more intelligent, though they cannot well be more in-
dustrious. ? (Phillip to Under-Secretary Nepean, dated
Government House, Sydney, June 17, 1790.)
RUSE TAKES A WIFE.
?[For] the first settler a hut was built, and
one acre and a half of ground cleared for him, at Parra-
matta. He entered on his farm of 30 acres the 21st
November, 1789, and was supported from the public store
until the 25th February, 1791, when he declined receiving
any further support, being then able to maintain himself.


He has since married, and has a child, both of whom
he wishes to take off the public store next Christmas.?
(Phillip to Lord Grenville, Sydney, New South Wales,
November 5, 1791.)
FIRST GRANT OF LAND.
Experiment Farm.
* ?ln pursuance of the power and authority vested in
me I do, by these presents, give and grant
unto James Ruse, his heirs and assigns, to have and to
hold for ever, 30 acres of land, in one lot, to be known
by the name of Experiment Farm, laying on the south
of the Ponds, at Parramatta, the said 30 acres of land
to be had and held by him, the same James Ruse, his
heirs and assigns, free from all fees, taxes, quit-rents,
and other acknowledgments, for the space of 10 years
from the date of these presents. Provided that the said
James Ruse, his heirs or assigns, shall reside within
the same, and proceed to the improvement and cultivation
thereof, such timber as may be growing or to grow here-
after upon the said land which may be deemed fit for
naval purposes to be reserved for the use of the Crown,
and paying an annual quit-rent of 1/- after the expira-
tion of the term of time of 10 years before mentioned.
(Signed) A. Phillip, Government' House, Sydney, N.S.W.,
February 22, 1792.?
There having been some difference of opinion as
to the accuracy of my statement in ?The Good Old
Days of the Hawkesbury,? regarding the issue of
grant to James Ruse, the following letter will prove
interesting to those who desire to know the facts; ?
Hamilton Lodge, Llandilo,
19th October, 1911.
My Dear Mr. Fitzpatrick,?
In your esteemed publication, ?Good Old Days,?
pages 134 and 135, you also have given us some
of his history and a copy of the grant in which you
give the date of it as February 22nd, 1790. I say
that is correct and believe it. Mr, C. T. Burfitt,
secretary of the Australian Historical Society, has a
letter in the last issue (14.10.11) in which he says
the date is 1792, and publishes a certified copy of
the grant from the Registrar-General?s Office, Now


my reason for Writing you is to ask you from what
you copied your MS for your 'book? Where
did you get your copy? I think you are right; in
fact, you must be; for if you will turn up a copy
of Captain Watkin?s complete account of the settle-
ment at Port Jackson, 1793, page 155, he states that
on Bth December, 1791, he (Tench) went to see
Ruse and asked him to show him his grant of land,
which he did, and then he (Tench) copies into his
account the wording of the material part of the
grant. So it must have been in existence on that
date. Tench, you will remember, left the Colony on
the 18th December, 1791, in H.M.S. Gorgon, and
never returned. So it is clear that a great historical
blunder has occurred at the Registrar-General?s in
the old, old days. Probably the grant was not regis-
tered till 1792, and then the clerk put the date as
it now is.?Yours, faithfully,
Geoege R. Nichols.
CLARENDON HOUSE.
I am indebted to Mr. Frank Walker, an eminent
authority on Early Australian History, for the fol-
lowing information, taken from a newspaper article
from his pen, on the subject of Clarendon House:?
The name of Cox is a household word in New South
Wales, and a few words concerning the founder?s career
will not be out of place. He was the second son of Eobert
Cox, of Minbourne, Dorsetshire, and was born in 1764. at
Devizes, Wilts. He was originally an ensign in the 68th
(Durham) Infantry, Maearthur?s old regiment, and was
appointed lieutenant in the New South "Wales Corps in
1797, and paymaster in 1798, arriving in Sydney by the
Minerva? on January 11, 1800. On the same vessel
were James Holt, Fathers Harold and O?Hara, and a num-
ber of other ?9B Irish insurgents. Cox was not long in
obtaining land at Brush Farm, on which he settled, and
success attended his efforts from the start. His holding
consisted of 1800 acres, which he purchased from settlers,
and grants from the crown, 400 acres of which were
cleared, and 245 acres under wheat and maize.


By judicious purchases he soon acquired a fair number
of live stock, consisting of 25 horses, 20 head of horned
cattle, 1000 sheep, and 200 pigs, as well as 20 convicts as
assigned servants. All this was accomplished in the short
space of 18 months. Cox engaged the services of the
notorious Joseph Holt, a in the Irish insurgent
forces, and as Holt had been a farmer of some standing
in Ireland, Cox could scarcely have had a better man. In
this secluded spot Cox devoted all his energies to the
business of farming and sheep-breeding for a few years,
when, about 1807, he purchased the estate near Windsor,
which he named Clarendon, and started the erection of
the house which to this day is one of the most character-
istic of the many old colonial mansions still preserved
to us.
As one approaches it across the fields, the large extent
of the settlement becomes more noticeable, and the first
object to attract the eye is the double row of beautiful
oak trees that border the avenue communicating with
the main road. Traces of another carriage entrance to
the house are visible before the fence is reached, but it
has long ago been denuded of trees and absorbed by the
fields. The homestead overlooks a great stretch of rich
river flats, where horses and cattle luxuriate in the abun-
dant feed. At the side of the buiding is an old pond,
covered with duckweed and water lilies, and no doubt
once contained fresh water fish.
The original house was a large, rambling structure of one
storey, built partly of stone and brick, the latter bearing
that warm, red colour so often seen in buldings of the
early days. It contains spacious and handsome rooms, with
modern wainscots, semi-circular tops to the doors, and
queer little corner cupboards with diamond-paned doors. In
the old drawing-room, now, alas! dangerous to walk upon,
once assembled many a gay company, when, doubtless, the
old-fashioned measures were danced and the picturesque
costumes of the early days of the past century were in
evidence. In the long, low dining-room one can,- in
imagination, once more behold the festive board, glittering
with its silver and cut-glass ornaments. At the head sits
the master of the house, genial, smiling, and seemingly
at peace with all the world, little dreaming then that a
few years hence a new route to the.unknown west would
be opened up, and to him would be entrusted the task
of constructing the first road.
The entrance-hall is stone flagged, and there are tall
niches at intervals along the walls, where, probably, old-


fashioned lamps stood, or statuettes, the representations,
possibly, of classic heroes. Rooms open out on all sides,
the majority containing fireplaces of generous proportions,
calculated to hold a good deal more than the diminutive
i ? 8-oz. coal ?? grates of the present day. The winter nights
down here by the river were fairly sharp, just as they
are now, and the comfort and luxury of a real good fire
of logs was something to be desired. It is not probable
that the wall-papers, though now hanging in festoons and
discoloured by mildew, are those identified with the
original owners. The old house has passed through many
hands since Cox?s time, and though the design of the
papers is obviously old-fashioned and out of date, these
coverings have been applied in comparatively recent years.
For myself, I doubt very much whether wall-papers were
known, or used, in this country at the time the old house
was erected.
Another feature of the interior?and this is a common
one with all the earlier-constructed habitations?is the
quantity of cedar, still in an excellent state of preserva-
tion, that may be seen. Doors, window-frames, wainscots,
mouldings, mantels, archtraves, all are of cedar; and these
alone represent a commercial value upon which one could
quickly realise. Then there are the queer litte cupboards
beforementioned, of all shapes* and sizes, wherein the good
mistress of the house was wont to display in some her
pretty nick-nacks and ornaments, and in others, probably,
a few stout bottles and long-necked decanters, kept an
array of cut-glass drinking utensils in countenance, and
were frequently resorted to when bluff old Macquarie
came posting over from Windsor for a confidential chat
with his friend, and at the same time to learn of the
progress of his famous road. Here, indeed, the imagin-
ation could run riot, and given a suitable time, soon
people the old ruins with characters that are not of our
day and generation. Alas! the opportunity for such flights
of fancy will soon be forever past, as already the building
lines are askew, the roof sags dangerously in many places,
and even now one side of the structure as collapsed bodily,
and almost obliterated a portion of the old garden.
Between the past and the present there is a great gap,
and the long flight of years is recalled as a false step on
the old floor raises a cloud of dust, and the rotten timbers
crumble beneath the foot, telling a tale of ruin and decay.
The covered paths of the deadly white ant in some of the
spider-haunted beams also speak of a force that still lives
when all else is decaying.


Outside grass and weeds have worked havoc in the onae
beautiful garden, and all is wild and uncared for.
The old familiar objects that once upon a time a fond
eye loved to rest upon, are gone, and the old master who
wandered many a time in this cultivated nook sleeps
peacefully in the churchyard of old St. Matthew's, whose
tower is just visible from the stone-flagged verandah.
His hands laid out this garden, with its many English
plants and flowers to remind him of his birth-place beyond
the seas, and he it was who built the home where he spent
so many happy and contented years. One can well imagine
how gladly he would turn his back upon the discomforts
of his mountain camp, when engaged upon the superin-
tendence of road construction, and make all speed to reach
the peaceful home so many miles away, soon forgetting in
the quiet joys of home life the cold and wet and the
desolation of the great mountain solitudes that he was
endeavouring to subdue.
On the death of William Cox, his son George inherited
the property, and by the latter it was left to his son
Charles, who later on disposed of it to the Eight family,
who in turn sold it to Captain Phillip Charley. At the
rear of the main building may be seen the old bakehouse,
and behind it the mill, a two-storeyed building containing
large apartments for the storage of grain. The servants
quarters adjoin these, the whole forming a complete
settlement, and providing an excellent illustration of the
mode of living in the early days.
The view from the verandah is beautiful in the ex-
treme, commanding as it does a wide sweep of the river,
with the highlands above, and beyond the commanding
heights of the Kurrajong. To the west appears delicately
tinted in the palest blue, that great natural barrier, the
Blue Mountains, which in Cox's day, were the theme of
so much speculation.
[Note. ?The above was written over twenty-five years
ago, since when the buildings have been partly, if not
wholly demolished.]
AN HISTORIC PICTURE.
Mr. J. C. L. Fitzpatrick (Molong), wrote in 1907:
??Some trouble which has arisen between the Windsor
Borough Council and the Department of Public In-
struction, owing to the retention by the latter of a
portrait in oils of Governor Lachlan Macquarie,


loaned for exhibition purposes some months since,
calls to mind the circumstances under which the pic-
ture was produced. Looking up local records, I am
able to furnish copies of correspondence which passed
at the time when the movement which resulted in its
being painted was first mooted ? ?:?
?Windsor Courthouse, 14th November, 1821.
?To Wm. Cox, Clarendon.
Sir, ?I am to request the favour of your attendance
at the Courthouse to-morrow at 11 o'clock for the purpose
of consulting- with the magistrates as to the mode of pro-
curing the necessary subscriptions for defraying the ex-
pense attendant on painting the picture of His Excellency
Major-Greneral Macquarie, to be placed in the Courthouse
here. ?I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
c ? Robert Fitz. 9 9
?Clarendon. 16th December, 1821.
?Sir, ? On Saturday evening I received a letter from
Major-General Macquarie, to be placed in the courthouse
the address, by which I find the General sets out for
Bathurst to-morrow, and on his return from thence he will
communicate with me, for the information of the com-
mittee, the time he will come to Windsor to receive the
same, when I will inform those concerned without delay.
The General expresses the strongest feelings of pleasuure
and satisfaction for our offering to have his portrait taken,
but as it cannot be done in this country, and the length of
time and other circumstances that may occur in getting it
done in England, he politely wishes his friends not to
persevere in it, and will no doubt thank them personally
for this their offer when he meets them here to receive the
address. You will have the goodness to inform the magis-
trates and committee of this without delay.?l am, Sir,
your most obedient servant,
?Wm. Cox, J.P.
?To Mr. Fitz, Windsor.
P.S.?Sir Thomas Brisbane has not yet appointed the
time and place to receive the address."
The friends in Windsor of Governor Macquarie did
apparently persevere, for some few years later the
portrait, painted in England, and deposing in a
massive frame, was placed in position in the old court-


house on the hill. It is the only portrait of its kind
of Governor Macquarie in the State, and great value
is placed on it by all the old residents of the historic
Hawkesbury. Macquarie was very popular amongst
the people in those dead-and-gone days when ruling
the destinies of this new country. lie paid periodical
visits to the old town. An only recently deceased
native some few years ago, calling upon his memory,
even then marvellously clear, despite the 80 odd years,
which had then passed, spoke to me in kindly terms
of the Governor of his boyhood days; ?ITis figure,
as he drove about, clad in his bright scarlet military
uniform, heavily braided, and with epaulettes, etc.,
and wearing a three-cornered hat something like an
Admiral?s, was a conspicuous one. His principal
friend in Windsor was Mr. Richard Fitzgerald.?
The good people of Windsor have just reason to be
proud in their possession of that historic old portrait,
and it is small wonder that they resent detention and
demand its return. For over 70 years it has adorned
the courtroom proper, and the kindly face of the one-
time Governor has looked down from his altitude upon
those who, year in and year out, have administered
justice within its four corners. Nevertheless the pic-
ture has a value altogether beyond that which is
attached to it as a sort of country town possession,
and it is questionable whether it would not show r to
much better advantage, and be better cared for and
appreciated in that great National Art Gallery, which
holds the artistic treasures of this State.
EARLY-DAY FARMING.
EXPENSES of farming in the Hawkesbury dis-
tricts were very great in the early days, when
Sydney depended greatly for her supplies from
there. In 1800, charges for cutting down and clear-
ing the weeds cost �1 per acre; breaking or tilling
the ground �l/6/8; chipping or covering the wheat


and sowing, �l/2; reaping �3; carrying home, stack-
ing, and thatching, �2; carriage to the Government
store, portage, etc., �l/19/7; for seed, D/> bushels,
15/-; the total cost to the cultivator was �l3/5/9
per acre, and this did not include the first clearing,
which amounted to �6/10 per acre. At this period
the cost of tea bought at Sydney was �4 per lb.,
sugar 2/6 per lb., butter 4/- per lb., cheese 3/-, and
in these districts there were no flannel, blankets,
or any sort of bedding for sale.
Wheat and grain were the mainstay of the
Hawkesbury district, and owing to the licentious-
ness and excesses of all kinds, the wheat was often
left unthreshed and uncare for, and it was through
complaints of this kind that Governor King ap-
pointed Mr. Grimes (Deputy-Surveyor) Magistrate
and Superintendent of Public Works of the settle-
ment, in July, 1800.
Owing to the shortness of labour in the colony,
Governor Mkcquarie issued a Government General
Order, 2nd May, 1810, which permitted soldiers to
assist in the work of the settlers and employ them-
selves amongst the cultivators throughout the set-
tlement during seed time, for the purpose of
cropping their lands only, and they were to be
paid by the settlers in grain or money at the rate
of 15/- an acre to 2/6 a day. On 27th November,
1813, when the 73rd Regiment were under orders to
embark for India, a Government and General Order
was issued, that, with the exception of the three
companies under orders for embarkation on the Earl
Spencer, the rest of the regiment w�re given per-
mission to assist the settlers with their crops
The Hawkesbury district was always subject to
floods and in 1806 one of the worst of the early
floods occurred, of which there is no definite record
up to that date. This flood took place on the 22nd
and 23rd of March, and the loss of life, buildings,


and foodstuffs was very extensive. Surgeon Thomas
Arndell, who had his farm at Cattai, stated that it
was within eighteen inches of his house, and that
was five feet over the rock at the corner of Cattai
Creek. The Rev. Samuel Marsden, in writing to
Governor King, states that the ?lower part of the
river from Green Hills to Addy?s, upon the north
side, a few houses were left from Burgess? down-
wards to Howard?s, and, in addition to the regular
constables, Mr. Arndell and himself had appointed
Dight, Rouse, Singleton, Robinson, Chauker, Sever,
Simpson, and Yowman.?? The losses were estimated
at over �30,000, in spite of some wheat and maize
saved. Owing to the loss of breadstuffs by this
flood, the Governor ordered a restriction in the
consumption of bread in Sydney. No cakes, biscuits,
or any kind of pastry were to be made or baked
or exposed for sale, under a penalty of �5 for each
offence, whilst 27 loaves weighing 21b. 2oz. were to
be made from a bushel of wheat at 561b. to the
bushel, when wheat was given in payment, but to
those who paid money a charge of l/ 6y 2 d per loaf
was made; the price then given by the Government
for wheat was 15/- per bushel. The flood waters
covered a surface of 36,000 acres, of which 11,000
acres were allocated to individuals. The first record
of rust in wheat occurred on the farm of Joseph
Holt, which destroyed the first crop of wheat in the
district.
PICTURESQUE RUIN.
PASSING up the Macdonald River, among wooded
hills, where pleasant orchards and bright green
stretches of maize flourish beside the water, w r e came
upon a ruin as picturesque as any in the Old Coun-
try. It was a hot morning. We tied up our boat
in the shelter of some she-oaks, and climbed the
steep white road to the hamlet of Lower Macdonald.


Half-way up the hill lay a homestead, and a little
beyond we saw a small churchyard, carefully fenced
round. As we went higher, a delicious fragrance
of briar rose greeted us, and we entered the ruin
of a small church. The roof was gone, but the stone
walls still stood bravely. Within, saplings raised
their heads, and a profusion of brambles and un-
dergrowth adorned the bare stones. Briar bushes
grew round the ruined portal, while at the farther
end remained two doorways, through which we
gazed at the loveliness of the river below.
As we passed down the hillside, we stopped at
the homestead to learn what we could of the ruined
church. It was built in 1859 by convicts, and
dedicated to St. Joseph. In those days, Lower Mac-
donald seemed destined to become a township, but
this ambition was never realised. * St. Joseph?s
Church took a year to build, and twenty-nine years
Later a ravaging bush fire claimed it, and its work
was over. So it seemed; but, as we glided down
the river, and looked back on the beauty of marsh-
land, stream and orchard, and the ruin-crowned hill-
side, we felt that the flashes had been powerless to
destroy the peace and blessing radiating from St.
Joseph?s Church.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
(From Various Sources.)
THE late John Tam, of North Richmond, kept a
diary and recorded the patriarchial ages attained by
many local identities. There were twenty-nine who
reached over, or upwards of, 80 years: ?
Mary Town 80, William Kirk 87, Charles Tompson 87,
Laban' White 80, John Merrick 82, ?Old Mick the
Russian? 112, Luke Stanford 80, Mrs. Chisholm 81,
William Johnston 83. Mary Ann Dempsey 100, Mrs. Sarah
Johns 82, Mrs. Mary Hughes 89, Mrs. Mary Hough 87,


Richard Skuthorp 90, John Cobcroft 84, Mrs. Ann Hanscll
(?) 88.
Then there were seven over 70:?
Rev. Thos. Hassall 73, George Cox 75. William Hall 74,
William Perry 70, John Richard Rouse 73, John Hoskisson
(spelt 6 ?Hoskinson?) 79, William Bowman 75.
From the ?Evening News? ?Fifty Years Ago?
column: ??In the Supreme Court, Pull Court. ?
Dowe v. Malherne and others. Suit for specific
performances. The complainant, Dr. Dowe, was a
magistrate of Windsor, and Malherne the proprietor
of a farm of 50 acres, called the Fed House Farm,
at M?Grath?s Hill. Malherne, while attending the
court at Windsor, was averred to sell his farm to
Dr. Dowe for an annuity of 30/- per w r eek during
his life (now 72 years of age), and a payment at
his death of �3OO to his brother in Ireland. �lO
was paid on account of the purchase money or
annuity. Some little time after this a Mr. Lehane
purchased the same property from Malherne for
�ISOO, with a life interest in it to Malherne and his
wife. Hence this action. The question was whether
Dr. Dowe had a sufficient contract in writing to
meet the provisions of the Statute of Frauds. The
Court held the document alluded to would not sus-
tain a suit for specific performance. As to costs,
the Solicitor-General, for defendants, said it would
clearly appear that there had been fraud, that the
complainant had overreached this drunken old man
of 72. The judges ruled, however, that fraud had
not been proved, and on this account the defendant
would have to pay, but on the law part of the claim
the complainant would have to pay the costs.?
An official record shows that in Richmond the fol-
lowing licensed houses were open for the sale of
liquor in the year 1837; ?General Darling? (Upper

Mrs. Charles Fleming, who died at Wilberforee,
belonged to a family noted for longevity. She was
89 years and 8 months old. Her sister (Mrs. Mary
Ann Everingham) died at the age of 83 years, her
eldest brother (Mr. Tristram Dunstan, of Sackville,
father of the well-known Anglican clergymen, Arch-
deacon and Revs. Tristram, Charles C. and William
J, Dunstan), was at this time well on in his 92nd
year; another brother (Mr. Benjamin Dunstan, of
Wilberforee) was in his 86th year, whilst the
youngest of the family (Mr. James Dunstan, of Pitt
Town), was in his 82nd year.
Mr. John Chaseling in 1920 sold his property of
148 acres at Sackville North, to Mr. B. F. Herps,
for �5,000. This property was one of the earliest
Crown grants in the Hawkesbury district, being
granted to Richard Evans well over 100 years ago,
at a rental of 3/6 per annum. Mr. Chaseling
recently had it surveyed and placed under the Real
Property Act.
The old church school at Richmond, in which
good old Matthew Hughes did such good work, was
built probably in 1810, for in a list of public build-
ings and works erected in the State from January
1, 1810, to November 30, 1821, taken from Mac-
quarie?s report to Earl Bathurst (July, 1822), I
find this:
?AT RICHMOND.
?1. A brick built temporary chapel and school
house, two storeys high, including accommodation
for the schoolmaster and his family, with a garden
and a grazing paddock for ditto, enclosed with a
strong fence.


?2. A burial ground of four acres, contiguous to
the chapel, enclosed with a strong fence. N.B.?
The streets in the town of Richmond are all laid
out at right angles, and some are made, there being
a great many good houses already in this tow a.
??3. A small gaol or lock-up, strongly built of
brick, with accommodation for a watchman.?
Then, among the appointments of Government
officials for the year ending 1810, we find: '?Parish
clerk at Windsor church, Matthew Hughes.? And
this: ?Master of the public school at Windsor
(afterwards at Richmond), Matthew Hughes.?
The warning bell in use at Kurrajong racecourse
has a history. It was the first bell ever used on a
racecourse in New South Wales, and was in use at
the old Clarendon course in the days of the great
horses Jorrocks and Betsy Bedlam. The old course
w T as on the site of Mr. C. J. Roberts? paddocks and
racing stables, ? Prestonville.? The bell is the
property of Mr. H. Skuthorp, who lent it to the
Kurrajong Race Club.

(Ad., January 27, 1854.)
May 2, 1855:?? A Centenarian. ?On Saturday
John Smith, of Kurrajong, an old man, white-headed
and in full possession of his faculties, with the ex-
ception of his eyesight, which was dimmed with
age, was put into the witness box at the police
office, Windsor, and astonished the Court by pre-
facing his statement that he was 112 years of age!
The old man gave his evidence so plain and fully
that a single cross-question was unnecessary.?
Historian Pickpocket, George Barrington, in the
early days a famiiliar figure in Windsor, and who
owned the farm for years in the occupation of Mr.
Jas. Wood, Freeman?s Reach (see first volume ?Good
Old Days?), died and was buried at Brush Farm,
near Parramatta. Barrington?s grave was fenced in,
and his name was cut in the timber.
Mrs. J. S. Calvert, the well-known authoress,
whose Australian stories are ?Gertrude,? ?Cow-
anda,? ?Tom Hillicker,? illustrated by herself, made
her home for years at Kurrajong. Her husband
was an equally notable man, who though he oirly
spent his leisure in the Hawkesbury district was well
known to many of the old residents there. He was a
young Englishman who travelled to Australia for
health, and falling in with Dr. Leichhardt, provided
his own horses and equipment, going on the first trip
to Moreton Bay on the journey to Port Essington,
when after many encounters with the natives and other
difficulties, their mission was successfully performed.
The first of the Wood family came here under en-
gagement to the first Governor, Captain Phillip,
and it is stated that the original son, John Wood,
was the first Australian-born man to visit England,


where he created a sensation by cooeeing for every-
thing, if he required a cab or a waiter, and cooeeing
in the true Australian fashion. It is said he was the
first to introduce the cooee to London. This sturdy
old pioneer died some years ago at Windsor at about
95, and the whole countryside turned out to the
funeral.
Mr. Daniel Egan, a Ilawkesbury native, was a
member of the Legislative Assembly for Eden, and
Postmaster-General in the Robertson-Cowper Minis-
try, October, 1868, to October, 1870. Mr. Egan?s life
was clouded by a terrible domestic misfortune. His
wife and family, returning from a visit to England,
"were on board the ill-fated ship Dunbar, wrecked at
the Gap, South Head, on the night of August 20 or
morning of the 21st, 1857. All but one on board
perished in the wreck, that one being a sailor named
Johnston. In the sixties a building at one time
occupied by Mt. Egan became the Victoria Club
House, which it continued to be until about 1871,
when the Auditor-General took possession, as offices
for his staff. When these officials vacated for the
new offices in Bligh Street?built by Mr. Wynne?
a new front was put to the building, making it
flush with the pathway, and the offices let to various
solicitors, agents, and others.
Frederick Ward, otherwise, Thunderbolt, the bush-
ranger, was born at Wilberforce, and christened in
the old Church of England on the hill. The house
that he was born in was burnt down some years
ago. It was adjoining Mr. James Sullivan?s pro-
perty. His parents and grandparents were spoken
of as very respectable people. He had relatives
in Windsor and Wilberforce when he was shot dead
in the Northern district by Constable Walker many
years ago.
Mr. William Freame writes:?l was agreeably
surprised to find in the Connell collection, in the


Barry Hall of the Melbourne Art Gallery, a late 18th
century room, the woodwork of which is taken from
?Clarendon,? Captain Cox?s old home between Wind-
sor and Richmond, built 1804, and donated by Major
Philip Charley. The doors, windows, mouldings,
chimney, hearth, fireplace, etc., are all intact, as
they were when in their original location, exactly
as I saw them many years ago, and all painted white.
The walls are covered with old-fashioned wall paper.
The Melbourne Art Gallery does not generally
specialise in Australiana this exhibit is a unique
relic, and a grand object lesson on the history of
Windsor.
In June, 1855, a match for �SO a side and the
championship of New South Wales, between Daven-
port and Dalton, a native of Windsor, came off at
the back of Cutt?s Hbmebush Inn. The distance was
150 yards. Dalton took the lead, and maintained it
throughout. Davenport beat Thomas Farnell, of
Kissing Point, who was for some time looked upon
as the champion.
?The King George was the first ship built in New
South Wales, by Mr. James Underwood, and was
launched in 1805, although previously, in 1803, there
was a little river trader, the Nancy, which was
actually the first, being built at the ?Green Hills,?
Windsor, where to-day even a small pulling boat
cannot find a water passage.?
At Windsor (N.S.W.) there are still to be seen
the remains of old boiling down works that were
treating sheep and cattle for their fat in the ?forties
and 'fifties. They are on Fitzgerald?s grant, a pro-
perty now owned by Mr. James Gosper, of a later
generation of those Gospers who got the place on
lease from the grantees. The relics consist of eight
large iron boilers, which were east at P. N. Russell?s
foundry in Sydnev, and a big iron steel-yard, which
was used in weighing the casks of tallow before they


were punted down South Creek to the Hawkesbury,
where they were re-loaded into coasters for Sydney.
The proprietor of that old boiling down establishment
employed from 60 to 80 Chinese to do all the work.
Then a plague broke out and the Chinks died by
the dozen and were buried two deep in big graves.
Soon after that the industry itself had a funeral.
HOW A SMART YANKEE FELL IN AT
RICHMOND.
IN the early sixties Richmond was a very lively
place. The Cornwells, Forresters, Freemans and
other ?Oxberry? natives made things hum. A flash
coloured barber set up in the village, and used t�>
give his customers one stereotyped yarn whilst dab-
bing on the lather. ?Australians are a mighty
clever people, but they want to travel to put them
fly a bit. Why, a smart Yankee could buy and sell
the whole colony.?
Albert Cornwell, dropping in one day to have
his hair cut, suggested that the barber ought to buy
a horse.
?Can?t stand it, yet,? said the darkie, ?but I?ll
have a go at one a bit later on!?
?Well, old man,? said Cornwell, ?I?ve got a pony
that we seldom use, and you might take him for a
p ew weeks.?
?How much a week?? asked the darkie.
?We won?t quarrel about that,? said Cornwell.
?Here. I?ll tell you what I?ll do; I?ll give you
horse, saddle and bridle as a present, if, in, return,
you?ll shave for nothing any friends of mine whom
I send round.?
?I guess that suits me down to my boots,? said
darkie and the bargain was struck. Next morning
Cornwell sent round a hatraek of a creamy pony,
saddle and bridle, the whole turn-out worth about
thirty shillings. That afternooh half-a-dozen young


six-footers dropped in and had a shave and shampoo,
each paying with Albert Cornwell?s name; and free
shaves went on until the Yank found his business
being ruined. His room was always crowded, and
on the third day he rigged up a special razor with
a saw-edge for Cornwell?s many friends; but the
trouble was to distinguish between the dead-heads
and the paying customers in advance.
?Are you a friend of Mr. Cornwell?s?? he asked
a man who was not in the joke, and, as everyone
knew Cornwell, the man answered, ?Yes.? The
saw-edge was duly produced, with the result that the
man swore never to try a shave in that shop again.
?Do you know Mr. Cornwell?? the coon asked
another likely customer.
?No,? replied the man, ?who?s he?? And he got
a shave, hair-cut, and shampoo, settling up with
the information that ?Albert? told him it would
he all right.
?Didn?t I ask you if you knew Mr. Cornwell??
asked the infuriated Yank.
?Well, I didn?t know him by that name,? said
the gentleman, as he fixed his tie in front of the
glass. ?He?s plain Albert to me.?
That night, to the relief of the barber, the pony
was stolen. But Cornwell said not to mind ?he?d
give him another, and next morning a boy arrived
leading a rich brown pony?the old creamy artisti-
cally dyed. A couple of days later the barber
visited Cornwell and said he?d have to return the
pony or take down his barbers pole, as his business
was simply ?bung.? A deputation then waited on
the barber, telling him the strength of the joke,-and
when the boys got up a subscription to pay for the
free shaves and shampoos, the darkle was satisfied.
Australians, he remarked, didn?t want to travel,
or they get so sharp they?d be able to shave them-
selves without a razor.
