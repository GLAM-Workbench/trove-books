AUSTRALIAN WAR WORK IN LONDON.
THE AUSTRALIAN COMFORTS FUNH
Coffee Stalls under Fire.
? One of the best stories- I have heard as to- the-work of the
Australian Comforts Fund was told me a day or two ago by one
of our soldiers who had come to London straight from the fight-
ing near Polygon Wood, in Flanders. He said that one of the
now famous coffee stalls of the A.C.F. was set up there' in a
position so advanced that, although they wanted very badly a hot
drink, many of the men coming off the battlefield preferred to
hurry past this- stall rather , than take its coffee and risk- the
shell-fire that was blazing-and thundering all about.. it. That is
striking testimony of the enthusiasm of the Australian Comforts
Funds workers; and it is- typical testimony/. Intense bombard-
ment-has often been-the surrounding within which the work of
the A.C.F.'for the wellbeing of Australian soldiers has been
carried on, and some of the workers are so- consistently near the
front line as to be always in danger, ? Seven of them,-it will be
remembered, lost their lives in Bapaume when the A.C.F, coffee
stall was blown up by a mine, while more recently the stall on the
notorious Menin-road was destroyed by shellfire. 'lt is part and
parcel of the A.C.F. system,' however, that its provision for the
troops shall be where it is most needed, and the hot food and
drink it supplies with such effect -to the men is by none and
nowhere worse needed than by the actually fighting men in the
forward trenches. ' For that reason the coffee stall of the A.C.F.
will continue to be found in .exposed positions, and its workers
will always be close to the firing line. ?
A. C. F. Commissioners.
Formed for the relief in various -ways of the Australian
soldiers in the field, the Australian Comforts Funds organisation
has developed, under circumstances well known in Australia, out
in Egypt and Gallipoli, into England and France, in which last-
named country.most of its activity now' is concentrated,? with-the


administrative headquarters in London. . -The work here is largely
that of handling the cargoes of goods so munificently supplied
by Australia, despatching them to France, purchasing in England
the needed supplementary supplies, and administrative detail in
general. Mr. H, E. Budden, who did invaluable work as Com-
missioner on this side, has been replaced by Mr. T. S. Woodburn,
whose activities as the supervising head of the scheme are divided
between France and England, and are of the utmost value. Mr.
Thomas Henley, M.L.A., who has been in the forefront of the
A.C.F. ever since the days when he was handling shipments in
Alexandria and distributing their contents to soldiers in the
Egyptian desert; is now at the London headquarters, and a tower
of strength in the department of shipping and transport, many of
the difficulties in which and much of the expense of carriage have
been lightened by his tact and energy. In the matter alone of
handling cargoes in their various stages of transit from ship
base Mr. Henley?s many interviews with the authorities con-
cerned have resulted in exceptionally favoured treatment of
A.C.F. goods and a consequent saving to the expense account of
very large sums of money; while with Mrs. Henley, moreover,
active in hospital visiting, entertainment of soldiers, etc., and their
daughters on duty in the records department of the A.C.F. head-
quarters, it is clear that the member for Burwood and his family
are most devotedly and valuably at work on behalf of Australia.
Mr. Wilfred E. Johnson, F.C.F.A., also of Sydney, is by now
well settled down to the supervision of accountancy work, the
local and Australian correspondence, and in energetic direction
generally of the headquarters office organisation; while the
London office contains three other Sydney men in Mr. A. C.
Barry, in charge of the A.I.F. and War Chest Club, Mr. J. H!
Brown, who supervises the newspaper distribution and the
business of remittances to soldiers, and Mr. S. J. Edwards, who,
as its London buyer, has been of great value in the matter of
economical outlay of the funds of the A.C.F.
In Egypt, the work of the A.C.F. is in the hands of Mr. J.
F. G. Hopkins, at Cairo, and Mr. R. S. Goward, one of the
original A.C.F. staff in the Gallipoli days, who divides his time
between Cairo and the front. The organisation in France by
now is far-spread. It is served by representatives at the Havre
depot, and at all the divisional headquarters of the Australian
forces, and a large staff of assistants, orderlies, etc. Mr. J. H.
Parry, of Sydney, is in charge of the important work at Havre,
handling the goods as they enter that port, and despatching them
to the divisional branches. At present, Mr. B. J. Waterhouse,
of Sydney, is the representative with the First Division, while
Mr. William Cope, whom he succeeded, and who was to have
acted for the A.C.F. at the headquarters of the Sixth Division,
has returned to London pending a suitable vacancy. Mr. FI.
Norris, with the Second Division, has been in some hot corners


by reason of work in the advanced lines, and it is due to his
energy and courage that the Menin-road coffee stall was re-
established, and in operation within 24 hours of its destruction
by shell fire. Mr. A. C. McCallum, of Perth, is with the Third
Division, Mr, E. R. Green, of Sydney, has been with the Fourth,
but now- returns home,' and is succeeded by Mr. Percival
Thompson, of Sydney, while' with the Fifth Division is Mr.
J. R. Campbell, of South Australia.
Some of the Fund?s activities.
It is to these men Australia owes the success, of this great
effort for the Australian soldier. Practically the whole of their
work is done as a voluntary offer of service by public-spirited
Australian citizens, and it is well done. As in the similar case
of the Red Cross, however, its source is in the generosity of
Australians Themselves, and the justification of that is in the
universal testimony of the Australian Army to the value of the
Australian Comforts Funds. It is work which over and over
again has been proved to have been indispensable. As the
work of the Red Cross for the sick and wounded soldiers is work
which had to be done, and must be done* so this of the A.C.F. for
the relief of the fit men to the end that they shall continue fit,
is work that is unavoidable, wholly necessary, and invaluable.
Its scope remains that of the original scheme, which had in view,
it will be remembered, the provision of ?comforts? for the sol-
diers in the form of food and clothing over and above the re-
gulation army issues, sporting material, the means of entertain-
ment, and the material for recreation. That was always a large
programme. With the growth of the Australian forces, and the
expansion of their needs under the varying conditions iff their
life abroad, it has become a vast responsibility. Both tho food
.and the clothing provision covers all the artices found to be of
benefit to men who have to endure in one region of the earth
the heat of Egyptian or Mesopotamian summers, and in another
the cold of the north European winter. The issue of sports
material comprises the paraphernalia of games outdoor and in-
door, and most of the games- of all the seasons. ? Entertainment
long ago was organised to cover the stretch of towns and villages
in France where our men are billeted, and by now the A.C.F.
cinema shows, with their circuits for the exchange of films and
their well-ordered effort to amuse the resting troops, are a
firmly established detail of Australian army equipment, while
the A.C.F. concert and theatrical parties?their artists largely
drawn from the army ranks ?journey from place to place behind
the lines with enthusiastic audiences assured to- them wherever
they may choose to pitch their tent. As to recreation, that is
in full swing in the camps and billets of the Australians, where


the padres are in charge of A.C.F. recreation huts/ which are
plentifully supplied with playing cards, chess, draughts, dominoes,
and other games, and where men who prefer to write or read
have at their disposal A.C.F. libraries of books, thousands of
newspapers and periodicals, and writing material.
A large range of ?Comforts.?
Merely to enumerate these activities is to prove the value
of the Australian Comforts Fund, as it is maintained and sup-
ported in Australia and administered here by way of the dis-
tribution of its gifts and the purchase of goodspto supplement
the supplies from Australia. The range of the purchases is sur-
prising. During the past year the London office has expended
upon them over �90,000. But they coveted many needs, all of
them demanding relief. There were gramophones on the list,
and footballs, playing cards, and Tommy cookers, biscuits and
beef extract, plum puddings and soups. Coffee, cocoa, and
condensed milk purchases in London amounted to �42,000, and
other thousands went swiftly in the buying of accumulated
masses of foods of all varieties. But that is only part of the
distribution carried out from London. And the London work
is only part of the triumphant success everywhere of the A.C.F.
Some Difficulties of the Work.
By means of the presence of an Assistant Commissioner
of the A.C.F. with each division of the Australian forces in the
field, a wide knowledge is secured of existing war conditions
as they bear upon the needs of the men, and the supply of those
needs, as far as A.C.F. provision may supply them, is the better
able to be organised and expedited. The A.C.F. representative
lives among the men, is in touch with their difficulties, himself
supervises the distribution of goods as they come to hand, and
has many facilities, available by no other means, for achieving
to the fullest possible result the aims for which the A.C.F.
exists. The worst difficulties besetting the London headquarters
of the great scheme are not, however, those that have to be
met and overcome by the representatives in France, but those
rather that affect the swift transport of goods as between Aus-
tralia and England and England and France, and those attached
to the provision of particular articles by purchase here, as the
need for them outruns the supply from Australia, or is concerned
with goods only to be obtained in sufficient quantity on this
side. There is also difficulty of transport in France itself, so
that transport difficulties in general should be remembered in
Australia as responsible for a very great part of the anxieties of


the supervising heads of the scheme in England and France, and
the successful efforts of these gentlemen against those difficulties
as accounting in very large measure for the high reputation en-
joyed by the Australian Comforts Funds.
Winter Requirements.
The difficulties as to purchase of goods most often issue from
the manufacturing conditions now prevalent in England. Goods
of almost every variety are now, as the householders of England
well know, exceedingly hard to come by?-for the simple reason
of short supplies-?and in respect of the A.C.F. it often happens
that delivery of some class of goods needed in large supply
is delayed by the inability of manufacturers to produce at the
desired level of energy. Material ,is scanty, and staffs are seri-
ously inadequate, and little can be done to relieve the position.
Purchases on behalf of the A.C.F. go on, nevertheless, and,
as to the winter of this year, timely effort on behalf of the men
has secured to them supplies which are believed to be amply
sufficient. The half-million pairs of socks from Australia, for
example, and the vast quantities of flannel shirts, balaclavas,
mittens, cardigans, and other warm clothing are all well forward,
while, contracts for the supply here, of Tommy cookers and
refills, primus stoves, and other possibilities of warmth, and
contracts for pea-soup, curry powder, oxo, cocoa and milk, and
other foodstuffs are vigorously in hand. It is hoped, therefore,
that the warming foods so necessary in such a winter as the
men will presently face are assured to them, while as to the need
of brightening, for them the short days and long nights they
must live through, footballs, boxing gloves, and the materials of
other winter sports, and indoor games of many kinds, and
gramophones, and other musical provision have been arranged
for in large quantities.
Work in France.
In all ranks of the Australian forces in France praise is
loud for the work of the A.C.F. It is, as will be well known,
a very varied work and never less than a work well worth while.
But if one detail of it more than another deserves the satisfaction
of Australians who support the A.C.F.,, it is'.that of the coffee
stalls established here, there, and everywhere, for the comfort
of men exposed to a bitterness of cold and discomfort such as
cannot be realised in the sunshine of their native land. Wher-
ever about the fighting line Australian soldiers are gathered to-
gether a coffee-stall is to.be found, even though the place be
within the eye of the enemy and in the midst of danger. As
already said, the coffee-stall of the A.C.F. has been the scene


of tragedies as ? well as heroisms. But it persists, and there is
no one who knows what comfort and sustenance is in a steam-
ing hot drink of tea, or coffee, or cocoa, or oxo, in such con-
ditions as those of the forward fighting area, but will honour the
men who, in despite of a surrounding as fearful as can be
imagined, or, at best, in conditions of hopeless discomfort, per-
form this fine service for the Australian soldier.
Mr. Henley?s visit to France.
Mr. Henley has recently visited the A.C.F. establishment
in France. His remarks on what he saw will be read with
interest. In company with Mr. Woodburn he spent several weeks
among the men, and for a good deal of the time was in front
line areas arranging for the extensive operations necessary to
the coming winter. ?Needless to say,? he remarks, ?the continual
bombing and shelling were not appreciated, and I claim to have
had a close call at Steenewerck, where a house not far from the
A.C.F. depot was shelled within five minutes of our leaving the
spot. The Commissioners fixed upon ?as the most central place
for billets, and from there I brought back to London several
pieces of shrapnel from a fairly heavy shellfire that found out
the town by way of trying to stop the ?push? which has since
been so successfully brought off. We spent several days in
Belgium. Other towns thereabout were all centres of great
activity in view of the then imminent fighting in the vicinity.
After visiting each division in the field separately we had a
two days? conference with the assistant commissioners stationed
with the five divisions, the object being to regulate supplies and
avoid the transport delays which caused so much annoyance last
winter. Headquarters of the Ist and 2nd Anzac Corps agreed
to help in eyery possible way, and it was decided to embark
upon an enlarged system of oxo and coffee right up to
the front line trenches, and advanced depots from which the
five divisions can draw supplies of comforts, such as cocoa-
milk, Tommy cookers, oxo, socks, etc., were agreed upon.
?From the testimony of officers and men it is clear that the
A.C.F. is established as an indispensable part of the Australian
army service, and relying upon the continued generosity of the
Australian public, arrangements have now been made for ex-
tended benefit to our soldiers. Not only is the inner man bucked
up with hot foods and protected by warm woollens, but in the
rest areas behind the lines a circuit of seven cinemas is kept
moving, and a vaudeville or pierrot show?The Anzac Coves?
and the 'Kookaburras??visits in turn each division, and does
a lot of good by relieving the men?s minds of the horrors of
war. An interesting item of my visit was the presentation
to General Birdwood of a very beautiful silk Australian flag


sent by the ladies .of Newcastle. This was done in an open
field under bomb and shellfire, in the presence of many military
officers, and no less a civilian than Mr. Winston Churchill.
?We visited the Somme area, where so many brave Aus-
tralians fell, and, after viewing the miles of grave-mounds there,
I make the suggestion that neither Pozieres nor any of the villages
between Albert and Bapaume should be rebuilt?the land is
poor, and at present looks like a deserted alluvial gold diggings?
but that the Allied Governments should- secure the area as an
international reserve, where the temporary monuments now there
might be replaced by permanent ones worthy of the thousands
of Australians who made the supreme sacrifice fighting our
battle for freedom and the real democracy.?
The A.I.F. War Chest Club.
The A.I.F. and War Chest Club for Australian soldiers in
London is chiefly the creation of the War Chest section of the
Comforts Funds, which established it financially with a subsidy
of �4OOO, and by now has expended upon it a very large amount.
This use of .moneys of the War Chest has been completely
justified by results, for the club from its beginnings until now
has been successful in attaching to itself a substantial body of
those Australian soldiers who are always in London in great
numbers,' and whose most insistent need is- an Australian home
of this sort. It was opened in 1916, with Mr. A. C. Barry in
charge, on behalf of the War Chest Fund, and Mrs. Samuel
as ?hostess.? This lady came to it from Cairo, at the instance
of General Anderson, who had been associated with her man-
agement of the Cairo 1 hostel for Australians when they were all
about that city in the days of their invasion of Egypt. The
reputation she brought as an enthusiastic friend of the boys
at Cairo has been amply confirmed in London, and by now
Mrs. Samuel and Mr. Barry supervise a smoothly-running con-
cern with a patronage of thousands of men.
I have always held, and still do hold, that the concentration
of Australian soldiers in the miserable slum-land of Horseferry
Road was a bad mistake. The reply to my objection has always
been one that shifts the responsibility to the Commonwealth
Office, which established the A.I.F. headquarters there?the ar-
gument on behalf of the club being that it must be near the
military offices. However that may be, I am of opinion that
the establishment in the Westminster slums of anything at all
which would bring there thousands of Australian boys was not
the best imaginable scheme for their welfare. But that is by
no means to depreciate the club as such. On the contrary. It
is a success.' It is widely popular. Its arrangements for the


soldiers are admirable. Its provision of many things they need
is both varied and adequate. At most hours of the day and far
into the night this section of. Westminster is a brimming stream
of Australian soldiers, going to and coming from the club-
going to it for rest, or recreation, or food, or some of the many
needs it serves; coming from it the better able by reason of
it to enjoy or to endure the loneliness or the miles of distance
or the inexhaustible attractions of what is to many of them a
strangely vast .and bewildering city.
Particulars of the Club?s Work*
The club is. under military rules for all concerned in it?
employees and soldiers?and it offers, in consequence, no har-
bourage to the now substantial army of absent-without-leave
men, who have grown to be a difficult problem of our military
authorities. It has a staff of 120 orderlies, lent by the AT.R,
and 320 voluntary women-workers, of whom many are Aus-
tralians. Its sleeping provision for the soldiers amounts to 800
beds, and an additional hut is being built, which will accom-
modate 200 more. The meals served every day total some
5000?their foundation basis an ample: midday dinner at a
shilling. The number of meals served in a year amounts, I
am told, to over a million, in which regard it will be understood
that the storage and kitchen arrangements alone are on the
great scale. The upper floor.pf the main building is laid out
as a comfortable lounge, which on frequent occasions becomes
a concert-room, or 'theatre, well furnished with a stage, foot-
lights, scenery, etc. There is a billiard-room, containing six
tables, a canteen, a bank, a post and telegraph office, and baths ?
all on the premises. Many concerts and theatrical performances
are given to the men, about 1000 of whom, moreover, go daily
on sight-seeing trips through London, at a cost of 4s. 6d. each,
while 100 to 120 are taken nightly to theatres at concession
rates. The offers of entertainment for the men from various
sources, including those made by individual callers at the club,
anxious to do something /Tor the Australian soldiers,T provide
for some 300 or 400 every , day. An invaluable institution, thus,
with its main objective the provision of a real ?home? for the
boys, and just now as busy as it ever has been, with all concerned
In its work at a fine level of enthusiasm-and energy. ?


?Sunday Times? [Sydney), January 28th, 1917.
? ? There is one patriotic fund that has come in for no censure
one that from the outset has been cordially esteemed and sup-
ported by the public, gratefully praised by the soldiers. That
one is, of course, the Citizens? War Chest. It is a democratic
sort of fund, administered with a constant, steady pressure of
human kindness. It has no snobbish taint. In its treatment
of our fightingstalwarts there is no hint of patronage, no com-
plicating pother and red tape.? '
?Town and Country
January 31st, 1917.
?The public?s liberal response to the 'War Chest?s? appeal
for immediate financial support, so that the stream of 'comforts?
to Australian soldiers in the various war zones should flow on
unchecked, must be peculiarly gratifying to the executive of that
laudable organisation. This response speaks volumes as to the
esteem in which the 'War Chest? is held in this State, such
?golden opinion? having largely been earned by the promptitude
with which this fund dispenses the money entrusted to it. Its
officers realise that 'who gives quickly gives twice,? and so, as
soon as any imperative need is cabled, off to the' London Com-
missioner goes the required sum the very same day. Does a
large demand drain its coffers? Never mind; the money must
go; when the public know the special need it will once again be
generous. The 'War Chest? trusted the public, and now it is
agreeably realising that the public fully and freely trusts it The
fund may not claim any special virtue for this rapid conversion
of cash into comforts for soldiers, but such alacrity is in such
pleasing contrast to circumlocutionary and red tape restrictions
that the subscribing public?always willing to do its bit for the
right kind of fund ?has stamped its approval on the 'War Chest?s?
way of doing things. And what will be even more appreciated
by the voluntary workers of the 'War Chest? is the testimony
of soldiers themselves' as to the beneficient results of this labour
of love.?
?Sydney Mail,? September 26th, 1917.
"No voluntary organisation in existence to-day is doing more
to win the war than the Citizens? War Chest Fund. It is essen-
tially a soldiers? fund. Its whole aim is to keep the Australian
soldier fit and well, whether he be in the thick of an engagement
on the fighting front or enjoying a spell behind the lines; whether


he be in France, Palestine, Mesopotamia, India, Africa, Mace-
donia, Egypt, or England; whether his work be on land, on the
sea, or in the air. No place where Australian fighting men fore-
gather to-day is beyond its sphere of work and influence. At
the front it supplies comforts of every kind to the men in the
trenches ?-warm food, warm clothing, tobacco, sweets, tommy-
cookers, and a thousand other things that bring comfort and joy
in the midst of death and desolation. In England it houses,
feeds, and entertains our men in the most wholesome possible
manner, providing counter-attractions to the many vices that face
the stranger in a strange land.
-The War Chest is'a splendid fund. It has'not hoarded up
the wealth so generously poured into its coffers in the past by
the citizens of Australia. It has no concern with the problem of
to-morrow. Its work is for to-day, for the comfort of our
fighters to-day, for the winning of the war to-day. When the
war is over it shall have achieved its great purpose.
?The War Chest gathers money, not to accumulate it, but to
spend it at once. Its management is such that there is no over-
lapping. It is this business-like grasp of the needs of the sol-
diers, and the equally business-like methods employed to relieve
such needs, that have given the public complete faith, in the
movement. No salaries are paid?-the War Chest stands for
patriotism working under a business system.?
?The Sun 99 (Sydney), September 27th, 191 7.
?The War Chest Fund has gained its unequalled popularity
by the highly effective fashion in which it has smashed every
known rule and law of financial sobriety, except one. That
one rule which it has observed is to get full value for its money,
?For the rest, it is in a perennial condition of insolvency,
but carries on bold and extensive operations sustained by sublime
faith in the public support which has never failed it.
?That is a picturesque feature about the work of the fund
which has probably had a share in the success of its appeals, but
the urgent, necessity for the spendthrift habits is the basic factor
in establishing it, firmly in popular affection.
?Australian soldiers are scattered over the face of the earth,
and, wherever they go, the praises of the War Chest are sung,
in trench and bivouac and tent, by every rank from G.O.C. to
Full Private.
?There is no undertaking for the comfort and cheer of
Australian soldiers which is administered with more economy,
higher efficiency, or greater zeal. The War Chest Commis-
sioners and staffs have followed the flag with such .expedition
that it has been laughingly said that Divisional Commanders dare


not confide objectives to any War Chest man, lest he should
establish a comforts, hut in the enemy lines, to be ready for the
soldiers when they came along.
?Stories upon stories of the doings of the War Chest men
abroad are familiar to this State, and there are countless stories
of unremitting labour and sacrifice still untold.
?The War Chest has its death roll too, a laurelled list of
men who, working humbly amid battle, have met their end beside
the men they strove to' aid.
?To pay money to the War Chest Fund, then, is to pour into
a sieye?but a sieve which is worked by some of the most skilful
hands in Sydney. What the sieve does is to separate the mass
of money into particles which, in the shape of comforts, Tall
exactly where they are needed by this division, that battalion, a
company here, or an individual soldier there.?
? Evening News ? (Sydney),
?Sydney is once more a scene of bustle and excitement.
The long-familiar sound of the money boxes is again heard,
and the invitations to buy buttons assail the ears of the citizens
wherever they may chance to walk. This is War Chest Day, and
of all the days that have passed since the outbreak of war, it may
be regarded as one of the most important, for the effort that is
being made is for the sake of the soldiers who are fighting for
the noblest of causes?-the cause of liberty. The organisation
that set the ball rolling this morning to collect fonds hopes by
this effort to run into six figures. It looks a big sum, but nowa-
days thousands oi pounds are quickly spent, and the War Chest
does not allow money to accumulate and lie idle ; it spends it,
and our soldiers who have served in Egypt, France, and other
places have given abundant evidence of the splendid way in
which the comforts have been distributed. The many acknow-
ledgments that have been received have shown the Australian
people that the organisation has been a wonderful help in making
the distressing conditions of warfare endurable.?
