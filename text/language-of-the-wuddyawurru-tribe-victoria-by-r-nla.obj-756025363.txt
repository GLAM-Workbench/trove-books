Language of the Wuddyawurru Tribe, Victoria. 1 )
By
R. H. Mathews, L. S.
In 1902 I contributed to the Royal Society of New South Wales an
article 2 ) describing six of the native tongues of Victoria. One of these
six languages was the Wuddyawurru, but as my previous remarks upon it
were necessarily very brief, I propose on the present occasion to furnish
examples of the different parts of speech not touched upon in my former
treatise, together with a short vocabulary of Wuddyawurru words.
The territory of the Wuddyawurru tribe may be roughly described
as extending from Werribee river to Ballarat; thence southerly via Lake
Korangamite to Cape Otway, and thence by the coast back to Werribee
river. Along their western boundary they met and mingled with the
Kullidyan and Dyargurt, whose speech was the same as the Wuddyawurru
in all essential points.
In a paper recently communicated to this Society I briefly described
the language of the Kogai, one of the tribes of Queensland. I now wish
to place before the reader one of the languages of Victoria, for comparison
with my former memoir. The grammatical constitution of the Wuddyawurru
differs in some important respects from the Kogai, among which the
following may be mentioned.
'ln the Wuddyawurru language many of the nouns, adjectives, pre-
positions, adverbs and interjections are subject to inflection for person
and number, in addition to the pronouns and verbs. In the genitive case
of nouns, the possessor and the chattel are both declined. In common
with some other languages in central and northwestern Victoria, there is
a trial number, made by the addition of the suffix „kullik“ to the plural
form of the word inflected.
All the information contained in this article has been collected by
me in the camps of the natives, every word having been written down by
myself from the lips of the aboriginal speakers.
The system of orthography adopted in my previous article will again
be followed, and need not be recapitulated in this paper.
Articles.
The demonstrative and adjectival pronouns serve the purpose of the
definite article „the“ in the English language. The indefinite article is
not expressed.

Nouns.
Number. Nouns have four numbers the singular, dual, trial
and plural:
Wangim, a boomerang. Wangimbulih, a couple of boomerangs.
Wangimkullik, three boomerangs. Wangimgetyaul, several boomerangs.
Gender. In the human family, different words are used, as, guli,
a man; bagurk, a woman; gulkurguli, a boy; ngunyagurk, a girl. The
sex of animals is denoted by adding words meaning „male“ and „female“
respectively, as, goim gulawan, a male Kangaroo; goim ngurdang, a female
Kangaroo.
Case. The cases are indicated by inflexions:
The nominative merely names the thing spoken of, as guli, as man;
kanni, a yamstick.
The causative represents the subject doing some act, as, gulia goang
bakunirring, a man an eel caught.
Genitive. The owner and the property are both inflected, as, guliak
wangimnyuk, a man’s boomerang; bagurkak kanninyuk, a woman’s yam-
stick. Personal property of any description can be declined by possessive
affixes to the noun, as, wangimik, my boomerang; wangimin, thy boo-
merang; wangimuk, his boomerang, and so on through all the numbers
and persons.
The remaining cases are passed over, being similar in principle to
those of other languages of Victoria already described.
Adjectives.
Adjectives follow the nouns they qualify and take similar declensions
for number and case. They are compared as illustrated in my „Thoorga
Language" x ), but differing in words.
Pronouns.
There are two forms of the first person of the dual, trial and plural
one in which the person addressed is included with the speaker, and
another in which he is exclusive of the speaker.
The following are the nominative and possessive pronouns.
Singular.
1. Person I Bangek

The foregoing full forms of the pronouns are employed chiefly in
replying to questions. In ordinary conversation the natives use the pro-
nominal suffixes illustrated under the heading of „Verbs“.
The objective pronouns, me, thee, him, etc., are not found separately,
like the nominative and possessive, but consist of pronominal suffixes to
verbs and other parts of speech, as.
Gerinnih (Someone), spoke to me, and so on. See also the example
under „Prepositions“. There are likewise forms of the pronouns meaning
„with me“, „towards me“, „away from me“, etc.
Demonstratives are numerous, but must be omitted for want of space
Interrogatives who, wela. Whose, wekanyuk. What, minga.
V erbs.
Verbs have the singular, dual, trial and plural-numbers, with the
usual persons and tenses. They also possess the „inclusive“ and „ex-
clusive“ forms in all the numbers beyond the siilgular.
The following few examples will serve to illustrate the conjugation
of a verb. The singular number in each tense only will be given.
Indicative mood Present Tense.
il. Person I speak Gelan
2. „ Thou speakest Gelar
3. „ He speaks Gela munya
Past Tense.
)1. Person I spoke Gelikan
2. „ Thou spokest Gelikar
3. „ He spoke Gelik munya
Future Tense.
!1. Person I shall speak Gelinyan
2. „ Thou shalt speak Gelinyar
3. „ He shall speak Gfelin munya
Reciprocal.
Dual We, in cl., speak to each other Gekiringal
Trial We, inch, speak to each other Gekiringitkullik
Plural We, inch, speak to each , other Gekiringity


Adverbs.
No, nyullawinyar. Yes, ngiyi. Yester-day, dyallinyu. Jomorrow,
yerrandyu. Where, wea. Here, mun. There, kiupan.
Prepositions.
Several prepositions can be inflected for number and person:
1. Person In front of me Kallinyunyik
2. „ In front of thee Kallinyunyun
3. „ In front of him Kallinyunyuk
Numerals.
One, ku-i-muty. Two, bullaity.
In conclusion it may be remarked that when I first commenced the
study of Victorian languages, the subject possessed no literature beyond
a few vocabularies. When Mr. R. B. Smyth published his work on the
„Aborigines of Victoria", some of his contributors very rashly attempted
to relate one or two native stories in the original tongue. 1 ) I have read
over these abortive productions, and can pronounce them to be mere
ungrammatical jargon, written by men who knew nothing of the
grammatical structure of the languages they were dealing v T ith.
In the foregoing pages I have touched only upon the fundamental
elements of the language, for the purpose of keeping this article within
reasonable limits for publication.
Yocabulary.
The following vocabulary contains about 150 English words with their
equivalents in the Wuddyawurru language. Every word has been written
down by myself in the native camps, and much time and labour have
been bestowed upon the work.
