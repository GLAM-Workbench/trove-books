To the Hon. the Chief Secretary , fyc.
H.M.C.S. Victoria, Hobson?s Bay, April 1, 1862.
Sir, ?I have the honour to forward the accompanying copy of my
journal on the late expedition to the Gulf of Carpentaria, for the
purpose of rendering relief, if possible, to the missing explorers
under the command of Mr. Burke, and of directing the movements
of the two land-parties organized and dispatched from Brisbane
and Rockhampton; and beg to submit the following condensed
remarks and observations of the voyage and expedition which I
had the honour to command, for the information of the Go-
vernment.


The voyage from Brisbane to the Barrier Reef (8 days)
augured well for a quick passage to the head of the Gulf; but a
strong gale commencing on the Ist September separated the
Victoria from the Firefly , and proved the cause of a sad disaster
to the latter, which was most unusual for that season of the year.
Fortunately the wreck was capable of being towed without disem-
barking the horses, which were accordingly landed on the Albert
River (Gulf of Carpentaria), about 30 miles from its mouth ; after
which I proceeded to examine the river, which I found at this
season navigable for 55 miles.
On Bth November I visited the Plains of Promise, which, to all
appearance, well deserve the name, although, in consequence of
many months? drought, not much grass was to be seen on them at
that time. Same afternoon we returned to the junction of the
Barkly and the Albert, and marked a tree on the west bank, near
a fine water-hole, about 300 yards distant from the river.
On 16th November I started Mr. Landsborough and party on
the south-western expedition.
On 7th December Mr. Walker arrived with the welcome news
of having found traces of Burke on the Flinders. On the 20th,
1 dispatched Walker and party to take up the tracks they had
found of Burke, and follow them up, arranging at the same time
to meet him on the eastern bank of the Flinders about the 28th
or 29th, in order to examine the tracks myself and obtain any
documents which might be found. On arriving at this spot at
daylight on the 29th, I found, to my great dismay, that the place we
had appointed to meet each other at was inundated during the spring-
tides, so that it would be impossible for horses to come down.
Leaving a bottle containing a memorandum for Walker, I pro-
ceeded up the river to within 3 miles of Burial Reach ; but having
some doubts in my mind as to my being in the Flinders, from the
fact of there being no marks to indicate the entrance and other
signs, I returned to the ship. However, on examining Stokes?s
chart, which I had left on board, I satisfied myself that 1 had been
in the blinders, and therefore, on the following morning, dis-
patched the second lieutenant in charge of a few stores I had for
Walker, with orders to examine carefully the eastern bends of the
river, at places marked on the chart.
On the 10th T left the ship with the barge and galley for the
purpose of prosecuting further search for the camps and relieving
the cutter, taking with me 8 days? provisions, and same day met
the cutter at Station A, on her way down to the ship, having found
no traces of any party.
Next morning explored the plains for 3 hours. We found them
dry mud, apparently overflowed at every spring tide, with the ex-


ception of some small rises. During this morning we came across
the tracks of a horse, together with the footprints of a man walk-
ing alongside, going north ; also, other tracks leading south.
We returned to the boats, and proceeded up the river to the
place marked G. Camped at 5 p.m., on the east bank, -and,
guided by Wilson, who had previously seen them, went to examine
the tracks of the camels which the officer of the cutter had disco-
vered, and found them at a dry water-hole about 250 yards from
the banks of the river. At this camp the country assumed a more
pleasing aspect, its features bearing altogether a different character.
Instead of mud and mangroves, we found acacia, box, gum, wild
plum, and other trees, while the soil was clothed with luxuriant
grasses. I started on the 13th January in the galley to explore
the river farther up. After about 4 miles we came to what proved
to be the Burial Reach of Stokes; at the head of this reach the
hanks of the river were of a rocky formation, and the bed of the
same nature, with only 6 inches water at low tide and very level,
so that we had to carry our boat nearly half a mile : here the river
divides itself into two arms, the one bearing south, and the other
south-east. I proceeded up the latter for about 18 miles, passing
over four rocky bars, at each of which we had to get out and haul
our boat over.
Finding no indications of any one having visited this neighbour-
hood, we marked a tree, and returned to the first rocky bar;
anchored there until the flood-tide made, which was 10 p.m., and
reached the camp at Burial Reach at 7'30 a.m. on the 14th of
January. Reached the ship on the 16th of January, and started
for Investigator Roads, where we remained till, at 11?30 P.M. on
the 6th February, Landsborough reported his arrival at the depot
on the 19th January, having penetrated in a south-west direction
a distance of about 200 miles, when he was forced to return for
want of water ( v . postea).
After coaling at Investigator Roads, and calling at Bountiful,
Booby, and Albany islands, I anchored on 17th February at
No. VIII. Island. Here we discovered a rock awash not noted
in either chart or guide. Surveyed it the next day, and examined
the doubtful Chilcott Rocks, which I found to exist, and in nearly
the same position as that assigned them on the chart
Arrived at Port Denison on the 27th of February.
I . . report further, for your information, that the navigation
of the Gulf of Carpentaria was found free from danger, from Booby
Island to Bountiful Island. From the latter place to about 8
miles off the Albert River the water shoals gradually from 5 fathoms
at 7 miles from the shore, to 3 fathoms at 4 miles, and 2 \ fathoms
at 3 miles; the bottom being mud. Many discolorations were
seen and passed through, with no perceptible change in the depth


of water. They were at first alarming, having all the appearance of
sand-banks with but few feet of water on them. In the channel
of the bar across the Flinders was found 5 feet at low water,
and at the Albert River 4 feet; the rise and fall being nearly
the same at each, viz. from 6 to 12 feet. Inside the bars both
rivers are free from dangers for the first 9 miles; beyond which
they are equal, if not superior, to the Brisbane and Fitzroy rivers.
There is only one tide in the 24 hours, and high water occurred
between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The winds in October and November were mostly from the
south-east in the morning, east at noon, and north towards sunset;
calms during the night. December 6th and 7th, a heavy gale set
in from the north-east, with torrents of rain, which flooded the
plains for some days. This gale veered to north, clearing up at
north-west, leaving this monsoon all the month. From January to
the middle of February the winds prevailed mostly from north-east
and north to north-west, but with no great strength ; frequent calms.
The country on the banks of both rivers, for the first 15 to 20
miles from the sea, is constant monotonous mangrove and mud,
more or less flooded with the spring-tides, and swarming with
insects. Higher up, as the land rises, vegetation improves rapidly,
and the scenery, although mostly very flat, is good and promising
for tropical vegetation. The first rains produced good grass, which
grew at the rate of an inch per diem, by actual measurement 10
days after the rain fell.
Alligators and crocodiles were seen; but they are neither large
nor numerous, and were both shy and timid. Some few snakes on
the banks of the river were seen; they were supposed to be of the
water-species.
The mosquitoes, sand-flies, and the common fly were most
numerous and troublesome. Every scheme was resorted to to
obtain rest at night, but to no purpose if there were not a strong
wind.
Investigator Roads, as is mentioned by Flinders and Stokes, I
found a good anchorage, secure from all winds, easy of access, and
having good holding-ground.
The natives of Bentinck Island numbered about 60, are treacher-
ous beyond conception, and those seen up the rivers ought not to
be relied upon with any confidence.

Sept. 11.?Barge of Victoria went adrift.
Sept. 22.?Engaged till this day lightening and getting off the
Firefly , and reached Cairncross Island, east side of Cape York,
against strong ebb-tide (peculiar to this season), which had landed

quite low. Soil of island sand or disintegrated sandstone, covered
with rank, dry, wiry grass. By 29th had caught 126 turtle for
jerking, &c., to save provisions.
Sunday , September 29.?At 4 p.m. anchored in Investigator
Roads in 5 fathoms. The winds for the last three days had been
north-east during the day, and southerly at night. At 1J to 2
miles off various discoloured patches were rounded or passed, but
no perceptible difference in the depths of soundings was found?
the water being of a very light colour generally makes the navi-
gation rather exciting. The changes in the colour of the water
this day have all the appearance of sand-shoals, or dangers of some
kind, but nothing dangerous to navigation was met with on our
way up the gulf. The depths found are generally very uniform,
deepening from the eastern shore to 38 fathoms towards the middle
of the gulf, with generally mud or sandy bottom; some few casts
of rocky or hard bottom were found near latitude 12� 25' 5., longi-
tude 141� e., with some 18 to 24 fathoms, and for 35 miles in a
s.s.w. course.
Sept. 29 to October 17.?Engaged arranging for Mr. Lands-
borough?s departure, who left 16th November. Note that whole
coast appears to be intersected with creeks and rivers for some
miles. Entered (17th) what was supposed to be a channel, but


proved to be the outlet of a river (supposed to be the Leich-
hardt).
Oct. 17 to November 18.?Nothing calling for remark except
intense heat.
Nov. 20.?Heat at 2 p.m. 104� in shade.
Nov. 29.?Heat at 10-30 p.m. 107�!!
December s.?Landed at ? Junction ? (Albert River), the spot
fixed upon for a depot on leaving Melbourne, and found the place
had been some feet under water last tide, and that for miles the
plains were then covered with salt-water, showing the place to be
quite uninhabitable, with no fresh-water to be had for miles around.
After we had passed two reaches going down, we were
suddenly surprised by an ambuscade of natives on both sides.
They were painted, and armed with long spears, womeras, and
clubs ; but they were not fired at. Therm. 98� to 109�.
Dec. 7. ?Mr. Walker arrived in the midst of a furious gale.
At 10 p.m. cleared up; light e,s,e. wind. Therm, at 2 a.m. 70�
Fahr.
Dec. 20. ?Mr. Walker started on return journey.
Dec. 29.?At daylight visited the place of meeting marked [A],
and found the nature of the country such that the tides overflowed
it at the springs, with nothing but mud and mangrove in sight.
About 22 miles further up, the river became more tortuous, and
several sand-banks were passed, contracting the tide, which was
running up strong. I continued on with the hope of reaching
Burial Reach ; but, after going on to 1 p.m., we stopped to dinner,
when I landed, and found the country better, with grass and water
in plenty. Left again at 2?30 p.m., and proceeding 10 miles fur-
ther, came to some cliffs on the eastern side (dark brown clay) 12
feet high. I had now come by estimation 35 miles up, and had
not got to Burial Reach, or anything like it, by Stokes?s descrip-
tion ; no ? grassy islands,? or ? sloping banks down to the water?s
edge clothed with grass,? but only mangrove and mud, and
one or two sunken islands with the tops of mangrove a foot
above water as we passed them, to indicate their position. The
country around here is the best I have seen in the Gulf, and
the grasses, of which there are varieties, very good, with the
timber larger and looking more healthy than any part of the
Albert. But, finding no traces of any one, and the upper part of
the river here not agreeing with its description, I began to fear
I must be in a wrong river, so I determined to start on the turn
of tide, return to the ship, and make a further exploration of the
coast to the eastward of this entrance. At 10-15 p.m. started
with the first of the tide downward, and in a dead calm, with much
thunder and lightning all round the compass.
Monday , Dec. 30.?At 7*30 a.m., the storm having passed sea-


ward, stood out of the river to the bar, and waited until turn of
tide and north-west or sea-breeze to fetch the ship, which we did
at 3'30 p.m. On examining Stokes?s book and chart with the first
lieutenant, I found there could be no doubt of my having been up
the Hinders, and that the difference in time of tide in seeing these
places makes so much difference in' their appearance. Stokes
appears to have gone up and down at night. I passed from the
first position [A] right up, by daylight.
January 11, 1862,?Started at daylight in three parties to
examine plains. These are mud, mostly overflown at spring-
tides, but some of the rises above high water-mark, and on one
of these came upon the track of one horse and one man, with shoes
or boots ; tracks led north, and were afterwards discovered lead-
ing south. In the afternoon went to examine camel-tracks at
Station G of chart, where the country being higher assumes quite
a different appearance, there being cliffs of brown clay 20 feet
high, whose summits are clothed with acacia, box, gum and native
wild plum. Tracks of camels could not be identified.
Jan. 21.?Squally with rain, but much less wind from west-
north-west. Ordered the annual survey of all stores to be held,
and in the afternoon proceeded in the gig to Bentinck Island to
try and get up a friendly feeling with the natives there. On
closing in with the beach they came down, about 30 of them, men
and boys, fully armed. Seeing they were hostilely inclined, I
did not land, but proceeded further south away from them, and
there landed, which was no sooner done than they were after us.
On their coming up, tried to show them by every means that we
were not come to do them harm, but to give them some presents,
which lat once did by giving them two tomahawks; they then
laid their arms down, but would not leave them for a moment, or
come near us. Seeing they were so very suspicious, I thought it
better to leave them for the present, and did so, going over to
Fowler?s Island to look at it. I found it of a rocky formation of
the same nature as up the Flinders River, with some good dark soil
on the top, on which good grass was growing, but no timber but
stunted mangrove, and no water fit for anything.
February 6.?Landsborough returned from his exploration to
south-west; had reached depot 19th January (v. postea ), and was
anxious to start south-east. No casualties.
Feb. 12.?0n landing, there being only two natives seen, with
much persuasion I induced them to come near to receive the gifts,
after they had been made to understand by signs and gestures that
all was for them and their families. I ordered the boat?s crew to
go down to the boat, which was about 300 yards off from us, which
they all did. I followed them myself about 10 minutes after, with
my back to the two men, who had kept their spears in hand all the


time. I had not got more than 25 or 30 yards from them, when
a noise behind made me turn suddenly round, dropping at the
same time my umbrella on my shoulder; as 1 did so I discovered
both these treacherous savages in the act of poising a spear each,
and stepping stealthily after me, not more than 10 yards off. My
sudden discovery of their intended object by facing them, put them
into confusion, and they stole away as if ashamed of being found
out. Their wives and children have always been kept at a long
distance, but nothing seemed treacherous in their behaviour further
than that circumstance, and their not being inclined at any time to
lay down their arms. lam now satisfied they are treacherous and
bloodthirsty. After leaving them, they ran down and took charge
of their boat and the presents, and seemed much delighted, judging
by the noise they made. At 4?30 weighed and took our departure
from the island, with the wind light from the north-west, and sultry
weather. Latitude, at noon, 15� 55'5.; longitude, 140� 4' 45" e.
Thermometer, 95� in cabin; on deck, in the sun, 130�; stoke-
hole, 145�.
Feb. 17.?At 6 p.m. brought up under No. VIII. Island in 6J
fathoms water, with 50 fathoms of cable. On approaching the
place to anchor, observed a danger not noted on the Chart or Strait
Pilot.
Feb. 18.?Fresh south-east gale with continued rain until 1 p.m.
On examining the above shoal at daylight, and finding it to be a
coral-reef, with only 18 inches water on it, of about 20 yards
diameter, steep all round, and right in the fairway of any vessel
anchoring at or passing this island, to avoid the doubtful rock to
the eastward of it, directed Lieutenant Woods to survey and fix
its position ; and the weather moderating in the afternoon, took
two boats, the galley and the cutter, to look for the doubtful
rocks *to the eastward. At 5 p.m. (low water) found them both,
passing with galley over the northernmost, with only 18 inches of
water on it, and pulled up to the south one, which is about 150
yards from it, north and south, and with 7 fathoms of water between
them, and steep to all round. This I found was awash, and had
a lump of broken dead coral on it, on to which the bowman held the
boat while bearings were taken, which were found to agree in every
way with the position marked on the Admiralty Chart for the
bank, with 1 fathom on it, and from which Chilcott Rocks bear
about north true 150 yards.
Feb, 27.?Anchored in Port Denison.

2. (a). Diary of Mr. J. McKinlay, leader of the Burke Relief
Expedition, fitted out hy the Government of South Australia.
I started from Adelaide with the camels, &c., on 16th August,
1861, and, on Friday, September 27, got all safe across the Lake
Torrens, no water being at our crossing nor in view. Next day
proceeded to Lake Pando (or Hope), the track thither, bearing
from about 2� 30' to 3� W., over a fearful jumble of broken sand-
hills, occasionally passing a small flat trending W.N.W. and E.S.E.;
at miles * passed on our left a small salt lake, dry, half a mile
long; met numbers of blacks, apparently peaceably inclined;
weather very hot and disagreeable for the season of the year,
a hot north wind blowing,
[The expedition remained at Lake Hope till October Bth, to
enable certain of the party who had been detached and had lost
their way to regain strength. The soil being soft, the horses were
unshod, there being little prospect of shoes being necessary for
a long time. While here rather a strange circumstance occurred.
A pelican, in an attempt to swallow a perch about a foot long by
about 12 inches in circumference, was fairly choked after getting
it half-way down its throat, and found in the morning quite dead,
with the tail of the fish hanging out of its mouth. A considerable
quantity of clover or trefoil on this lake; and at the eastern end,
on the flooded flat, grass, but not abundant. The country in
this part does not appear to have been visited by any rain for very
many months; indeed years must have passed since any quantity
has fallen in this sandy region ; the bottoms of the claypans
are nearly as hard as bricks. A considerable quantity of salt-bush
of various kinds around the lake and on the flats, with some poly-
gonum on the flooded flats; innumerable pigeons.]
Tuesday , Oct. B.?Started from Pando Lake Camp; wind west
and cool, and reached junction of Pando Creek, 4J miles. Creek
about 250 yards to 300 broad; on the s.w. bank of lake there
appear to be layers of salty substance. Tipandranara Lake bears
from junction w.n.w. Within 2 miles, the creek contracts to less
* Whenever possible, the distance of each day?s march will follow the day?s
diary. But in order to distinguish those made on the main route from the occa-
sional excursions made from camps or depots, the distances of all the latter will be
printed in italic.?[Ed.]


than 100 yards, and at camp about 6 feet. Arrived at 4-10 r.M.
on small Lake Uppadae or Camel Lake ; total distance 15 miles
of miserable country, with salt-bush of various description, and
samphire, and small stones occasionally. Lake about 1� mile
long, by an average width of f of a mile, surrounded by sandhills,
very little timber, and that little of the most miserable description
of box; a considerable quantity of rushes and a little grass round
the margin, and lots of waterfowl. Interpreters absconded. Day?s
course from n. 20� w. to N. 10� w., and latterly as much as n. ;
distance made about 15 miles.
Oct. 9. ?Camped at a long deep water-hole. Creek dry in a
number of places ; distance 12| miles.
Oct. 10.?Afternoon scoured great part of the country a-head,
and could find no water; camped beside a small pool of water in a
creek that I had crossed at mid-day; distance 7 miles,
Oct. 11.?Started with Mr. Middleton to go to the relief of
whites said to be in the interior. On a bearing of 18�, at 22 miles
arrived at Lake Perigundi, a semicircular lake, from 3 to 4 miles
in length, by If mile broad. The water not very good; the
natives even dig round in the clay a short distance from the lake
for water for their use.
Oct. 12. ?Camped on a fine long sheet of water, Wankadunnie,
1� mile distant.
Oct. 14.?After first miles travelled over undulating country
of sand, dry flats, and flooded ground. From the top of the
highest sandhill, at that distance, the whole country, particu-
larly to the eastward, is one mass of floated timbered flats, and
subject to awful inundations. At those times it must be quite
impracticable, the main creek (apparently) upon our right varying
from 1 to 2J miles in width, with patches of young trees across its
bed and sides. If this country had permanent water, and rain
occasionally, it would do well for stock of any kind, having a fair
sprinkling of grass, compared with anything of late seen. At
14 miles came to the bed of a small dry lake, with lots of fine
grass. When rain has fallen on this country it is difficult to say ;
most of the herbs and grass, and shrubs, are as dry as tinder, and
will ignite at once, but the country is more open and fit for pasture.
At 16 miles crossed the bed of salt-lake, now dry, and of no great
extent, running north and south, in an extensive flat. Camped on
west side of Siva Lake, or Perigundi Lake; found it exceedingly
boggy; and what seemed clover was nothing but young samphire;
little or no grass; distance 25 \ miles.
Oct. 15.?Finding this lake won?t suit as a depot till my return
from searching for reported white men, I started to-day to en-
deavour to find a place for that purpose, and travelled over alter-


nate heavy and high sandhills and flooded wooded, polygonum-
flats, with a few grassy patches. At 11 miles, came to a lake,
Cudye-cudyena; plenty of grass and clover, but the water all but
dried up, a few inches only being around its margin ; all the
centre and south end, and side, being, a mudbank. On my way
back came on a creek with sufficient water and grass, though dry,
to suit the purpose, at 2 miles, and pushed on to camp; distance
2 miles.*
Oct. 16.?Passed n.w. arm of lake; then began to ascend the
sandhills, which were very soft, high, and steep ; kept on till
arrived at water close within f of a mile of where I intended to
fix the camp as depot; total distance, 8-| miles to Careri Creek,
which seems to flow from the west of north, or nearly north and
south; name of water-hole and camp is Wantula Depot.
Oct. 17.?Making arrangements for start in search of the white
men.
Oct. 18. ? At 8 a.m., started; crossed well-grassed flooded poly-
gonum flats or plains, for an hour, crossing Kiradinte in the Careri
Creek ; then left the creek on the left, and passed over a succession
of sand ridges. At 9-15 arrived at Lake Cudye-cudyena, at about
9 miles. It was quite a treat; abundance of good water, and
any quantity of grass of various kinds, and plenty of clover. It is
about 6 miles long, and fully mile wide, well timbered. On a
bearing from southern end of lake (now called Lake Buchanan),
Lake Bulpaner, now all but dry, is distant about 2 miles, along
almost a valley. Sent back letter to Camp Depot to desire them
* A strange circumstance occurred this evening, showing isolated instances of
gratitude and honesty of the natives. In the evening, after my return, a number
of natives were near the camp ; amongst them, just as they were about to depart,
I observed an elderly man and his son, a boy of 8 to 10 years, who appeared
to be an invalid, and was about to be carried off by the father. I stopped him ;
and, as I was at supper, gave the youth some bread and meat, and tea; when they
all took their leave. About the end of the first watch (which was regularly kept),
I was awake, and heard the person on watch, Middleton, speaking evidently to a
native; who, to my astonishment, as well as to Middleton?s, ventured up to the
camp alone at night; and what would the reader suppose his errand was ? It was
to bring back our axe, that one of his tribe had purloined unseen from the camp
during the afternoon ! On delivery of said article he at once took his leave, pro-
mising to come in the morning.
Next morning a few of the natives approached the camp; but stood off at a
respectable distance, not sure how they were to be dealt with for their dishonesty,
till, by and by, the old man with a few others came up; and gradually they that
stood aloof came up also. Amongst them were women and children, to whom I
made various little presents of beads and fishhooks, with which they seemed
pleased. To the old man, for his honesty, I gave a tomahawk, with which he
appeared highly pleased?his name was Mootielina: the thief I could not find out,
or would have given him his deserts likewise. They did not muster very strong
this morning, only about 100; but numbers of others were visible all round the
lake at the different camps. They all appeared very civil, whether from fear or
naturally I could not guess.


to move on to this place, so much more desirable for a depot than
where they are now. Turned out the animals to await their return.
Very open country till within 1 mile of Camp at Gunany, a large
creek, about 60 to 80 yards wide, and from 20 to 30 deep, on
which we found a number of natives just finishing their day?s fish-
ing. They had been successful, and had three or four different
sorts of fish, viz., the cat-fish of the Murray, the nombre of the
Darling, and the brown perch ; and I think I observed a small cod.
They offered, and I took several, which were very good: they
promised to bring more in the morning. We came upon and
crossed a large flooded wooded polygonum-flat, which continued
close to the camp. Distance travelled , 25f miles.
Oct. 19. ?Early this morning, about 80 natives, of all sorts,
healthy and strong, visited the camp, and could not be coaxed or
driven away. I think they would have tried to help themselves,
were it not from fear of the fire-arms. How they came to know
their deadliness I cannot say. Crossed creek to Toorabinganee, a
succession of reaches of water in a broad creek, some apparently
deep; then over very high sandhills, pretty well grassed, and
arrived at Luncheon Place, an island often dry, now partly so, on
south-eastern side, in an extensive irregular lake of about to
9 miles long, by an average of If to 2 miles ; very hot; name of
Lake Canna Canta-jandide. Thought I might be able to cross it
at the narrowest place with the horses and camels, instead of going
all round, as it put me out of my course ; but found it too deep, so
had to go round. Towards the end of our day?s journey, over flat
country, with large dry beds of lakes or swamps, as dry as ashes,
with a saltlike appearance, the only vegetation being a few scat-
tered bushes of samphire, and an occasional salt-bush; a more dreary
country impossible to imagine. Arrived at Lake Moolion-
dhurunnie, a nice little lake, nearly circular, and nearly woodless,
about mile diameter. Abundance of good water, and plenty
of feed?clover, and some grass. Bearing of creek that fills lake,
350� ; east end, 87�; west end, so 3� ; north side 15�,* On arrival
at lake, saw several native-fires, which, on our lighting ours, were
immediately put out. Distance travelled , 28 miles.
Oct. 20. ?At day-light, about 90 to 100 natives, of all sorts,
visited us; they were not so unruly as those of the morning
before, having evidently had some communication with whites,
using the word Yanaman for horse, as in Sydney, and one or two
other words familiar to me. Plenty of fish of all sorts in the lake,
although not very deep. The natives here say that the whites
have left the above place, and are now at Undaganie. I observed
several portions of European clothing about their camps on our
course. The sandhills were exceedingly high on the western side,
