NEW SOUTH WALES.
Introduction,
The Adelaide Jubilee Exhibition affords an appropriate oppor-
tunity for noting tbe relative positions of the Australasian
Colonies, and for disseminating information respecting their
progress and resources.
In the early part of the seventeenth century several portions
of the Australian continent and adjacent islands were visited by
Dutch navigators, who bestowed upon them names commemo-
rative of their own nationality, such as New Holland, New
Zealand, and Van Diemen’s Land. Erance, Spain, Germany,
and the Netherlands have now interests in the South Pacific.
The discovery of the eastern shores of the Australian con-
tinent by Captain Cook, in 1770, led to the first Australasian
settlement being founded at Sydney by the British Government,
in 1788. The British Colonies which have sprung from this-
settlement contain an area of 3,169,129 square miles, of which
New South Wales contains 310,700, —Victoria, 87,884, —South
Australia, 903,690, —Queensland, 668,497, —Western Australia,
1,060,000, —New Zealand, 104,403, —Tasmania, 26,215, —andEiji,
7,740, square miles.
The estimated population of the British Colonies in Austra-
lasia at the end of 1885 was 3,414,956, distributed as under
New South Wales, 980,573; Victoria, 991,839; South Australia,


320,231; "Western Australia, 35,086; Queensland, 326,916 •
New Zealand, 026,517; Tasmania, 133,791. In the year 1881
there was an increase of 111,151 souls, arising from the excess
of immigration over emigration and of births over deaths. Fiji
at the last Census had a population of 121,902, of whom 115,635
were aborigines. The proportion of the sexes amongst the
European population of the Australian Colonies was estimated,
in 1881, at 11876 males to 100 females, or BT2I females to 100
males. The average number of inhabitants of European descent
was less than one person to the square mile. There is room in
New South Wales alone for a very large accession of new
population for the development of its pastoral, agricultural,
mineral, and other resources.
D uring the last decennial period the population of the Australian
Colonies (1871-81) increased 12 per cent., commerce 47 per cent.,
wool production 70 per cent., acres under cultivation 120 per cent.,
railways 431 per cent., telegraphs 190 per cent., and revenue 123
per cent. The annual revenues of the several Governments in-
creased from 13f millions in 1875 to 24 millions sterling in 1885,
being an average of £7 6s. Bd. per head of population. The
live stock in Australasia consisted at tbe end of 1885 of
82,169,364 sheep, 8,068,170 cattle, 1,302,160 horses, and 959,942
pigs. The land under cultivation increased from 3,165,000 acres
in 1871 to nearly 7,000,000 acres in 1881, and the total acreage
under crop at the close of 1885 was 8,028,551.
The tonnage of shipping entered and cleared at all the ports
in Australasia had increased at end of 1885, to 12,407,999 tons.
In 1871 the tonnage was 4,300,000, and in 1881, 9,504,000.
Several lines of steamships, some of them considerably over five
thousand tons burthen, are now engaged in the carrying trade.
The value of Colonial produce and manufactures exported for
1885, was £51,553,486. The exports consisted principally of
products of the pastoral, agricultural, and mining industries,
such as wool, tallow, hides, preserved meats, wheat, gold, silver,
tin, copper, coal, &c.


The average deposits in the Colonial Banks o£ issue, during the
quarter ending 30th June, 1886, amounted to £86,296,860.
In .1885 the trade between the Australian Colonies, England,
and Eoreign States amounted to £114,821,977, or an average
o£ £35 Is. Id. per head of population, o£ which the sum of
£l9 6s. 4d. was for imports and £l5 14s, lOd. for exports.
At the end of 1885 the various Australasian Governments
possessed 8,024 miles of railways in active operation, and 2,333
miles were under construction in various parts of the interior.
The railways are now returning fair interest on the capital
invested, and are important factors in the industrial progress
of the Colonies. There are 35,531 miles of line, and 66,439 miles
of wire, of electric telegraphs connecting every township of any
importance in the Australasian Colonies; and by means of the
ocean cables the latest intelligence from the chief nations of the
world is disseminated throughout Australia almost as soon as
it is published in European cities. The Colonies afford all the
comforts of modern civilized life, with but little of the poverty
existing in older countries.
The food supply of Great Britain is largely supplemented by
Australian grain and preserved meats. During the agricultural
season of 1885-6 these Colonies produced 31,883,038 bushels of
wheat, 14,472,224 bushels of oats, 6,093,647 bushels of maize,
and 1,020,586 bushels of other cereals, 412,437 tons of potatoes,
1,067,356 tons of hay, and 2,225,618 gallons of wine.
The public debts of the seven Colonies of Australasia at the
end of 1885 amounted to only £140,970,119 # , or an average of
£42 Bs. 9d. per head of population, incurred for the construction
of railways and other reproductive public works, and the con-
sequent development of the varied resources of the several
Colonies. The expenditure of the several Colonies in 1885
* Including £3,217,930 accrued sinking fund of the Colony of New Zealand,


amounted to £25,221,578 against revenue to tlie amount of
£24,017,112, showing a deficit of £1,204,578 for that year.
Out of the 2,023,288,960 acres contained in the Colonies, only
111,590,579 acres had been alienated at the end of 1885, leaving
1,911,698,381 acres unalienated. The vast extent of the public
estate gives ample security for any loans that may be required
for national purposes.
Settlement, Position, and Extent of
New South Wales.
Discovered by Captain Cook in 1770, and first settled in 1788,
New South Wales dates its prosperity from the commencement
of the present century, when the introduction of the Merino
sheep by Captain Macarthur rapidly led to the settlement of the
interior for pastoral and industrial pursuits. In 1851 the south-
western districts of New South Wales were formed into the
Colony of Victoria, and in 1859 its northern districts into the
Colony of Queensland.
The boundaries of New South Wales are marked by 28° 10'
and 37° 28' south latitude, and by the 141° east longitude and
the Pacific Ocean. The total superficial area is estimated at
198,848,000 acres. The coast line from Point Danger to Cape
Howe is about 700 miles long. The extreme breadth is about
850 miles, and mean breadth 600 miles. The greatest length is
900 miles.
Physical Aspect.
There is considerable diversity of physical aspect in this large
extent of country. At a distance varying from 25 to 120 miles
from the seaboard, a range of mountains, from 3,000 to 7,000
feet in height, stretches from north to south, throwing out spurs
in every direction. Numerous streams flow down the eastern


slopes into the sea, while the large rivers, Murrumhidgee,
Murray, Lachlan, Darling, Macquarie, Bogan, Castlereagh,
Namoi, Macintyre, and other rivers, drain the western slopes.
The coast-line is indented with fine harbours, one of which,
Port Jackson, on which Sydney the capital is situated, is unsur-
passed hy any in the world.
Natural Divisions of the Colony,
The principal great natural divisions of the Colony of New
South Wales are the eastern seaboard territory, the central range,
and the western plains. The seaboard districts undulate with
hill and valley, and possess rich alluvial flats adapted to every
kind of cultivation. Much of this portion rests on a vast basin
of coal. Beyond the coal areas the country abounds in gold,
silver, copper, lead, tin, and other minerals. The extensive
western slopes and plains are specially adapted for pastoral and
agricultural pursuits. Millions of sheep, cattle, and horses are
fed upon the natural grasses of the country.
Climate and Health.
Situated in the temperate zone, the climate of New South
"Wales approximates generally to that of southern Europe.
There are all varieties of climate, while the range of the ther-
mometer is much less than in any country within the same
parallels of latitude in the northern hemisphere. The climate is
healthy; the air is clear, the light brilliant, the sky for a great
part of the year almost cloudless, and the nights usually cool.
The mean annual temperature of Sydney is 627 degrees. In
vital statistics the Colony compares favourably with most parts
of the world, and instances of great longevity are numerous.
Births per 1,000 of mean population in 1886 averaged 37 03 per
thousand; deaths, 14-89; and marriages, 7‘99. The excess
of births over deaths amounted to 14874 per cent.


Government.
New South Wales has a Governor appointed by the Crown ,
and a Parliament consisting of two Houses, the Legislative
Council and the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament is
invested with plenary powers, subject to the reservation of the
Queen’s assent by the Governor, to certain classes of measures
affecting Imperial and other interests.
The Members of the Legislative Council hold their seats for
life, and by the Cover nor
The Legislative Assembly consists of 122 Members, elected
by ballot. Manhood suffrage is the qualification of a voter.
Parliaments are triennial.
The Executive Government consists of nine Members, as
follows:
The Colonial Secretary.
The Colonial Treasurer.
The Secretary for Lands.
The Secretary for Public Worts.
The Minister of Public Instruction.
The Minister of Justice.
The Secretary for Mines.
The Attorney-General.
The Postmaster-General.
Administration of Justice.
The laws of New South Wales are substantially identical with
those of Great Britain. The Supreme Court has as regards the
Colony all the powers which are vested in the superior Courts
of England. There are five Judges—the Chief Justice and
four Puisne Judges.
Besides the fixed Courts in the metropolis, Circuit Courts are
regularly held in the principal towns of the interior, to try civil
and criminal cases. District Courts and Courts of Quarter
Sessions are also frequently held in Sydney and many country
towns, presided over by seven District Court Judges. In addition
to this there are 249 Courts of Petty Sessions.

Increase of Population.
The progress of the population of New South Wales and its
number at the end of the last five decades may be seen from the
following figures: —
In 1841 there were 149,669.
~1851 ~ ~ 197,168, after giving up 68,335 to Victoria.
~1881 ~ ~ 358,278, after giving up 23,000 to Queensland.
„ 1871 „ „ 519,182.
„ ISSI „ ~ 781,265.
At present the population is about 1,030,000, and is increasing
more rapidly than that of any other Colony. Last year there was
a nett gain of 44,052 persons. The increase in population was 6313
per cent, during the last ten years, or 5 -02 per cent, annually; but
in such a vast country, abounding in wealth and resources, there is
ample room for a population of twenty millions. The proportion
of the sexes was at last census; Males, 5471, and females, 45 - 29

At the Census of 1881 there were 135,326 inhabited houses,
6,016 houses not inhabited, and 2,398 houses in course of con-
struction. Comparing the increase in the number of the habita-
tions of the people during the last two decennial periods, there


was* an increase of 45,133 for 1872-81, against 34,030 in the
previous decade. The returns also indicate that the buildings
erected of late years are of a thoroughly substantial character,
there being an increase of 15,920 stone or brick houses for the
period 1871-81, against 9,858 for 1861-71.

Land Policy .
The Land Policy of the Colony of New South Wales has been
entirely changed by the Crown Lands Act of 1881, which came
into operation on Ist January, 1885. By this Act the Colony is
divided into three Divisions denominated respectively the Eastern,
Central, and Western. The new law provides for various classes
of holdings, such as absolute and conditional freeholds and lease-
holds. Hitherto nearly the whole of the unalienated portion of the
Colony has been let to pastoral tenants, in runs under one general
system for terms of years. These runs, or leaseholds, were liable
to be encroached upon by any eligible person who wished to
acquire a freehold, and in many cases by an annual leasehold to
three times the extent of the conditional freehold. There were
many other ways in which the leased runs could be diminished
by alienation and reservation. The tenant was at the end of this
term permitted to renew his leasehold, and a reduction was made
in his rent for the new period proportionate to the area taken
from his holding. Under the new system all the runs in the
Colony were to be divided into two fairly equal parts, the Govern-
ment determining which part shall be let to the tenant at present
in occupation, and which part shall be resumed for the benefit
of the public. The lessee, however, has a preferent right
of obtaining an annual occupation license for the resumed
area, which entitles him to use the land within that area for
grazing purposes, but not to the exclusion of any person who
may wish to acquire a better tenure. The half of the run let as
a pastoral lease cannot be encroached upon or resumed by the
Crown during the currency of the lease, except in a very few
instances, and then only for some specific purpose for the public
benefit. The tenures and rents are different in the different
parts of the Colony. In the Eastern Division the tenure of a
pastoral lease is for five years at a rental of not less than Id. per
acre per annum. In the Central Division the tenure is for ten
years and the rent not less than per acre. In the Western
Division the tenure is for fifteen years, and the rent not less than


Id. per acre per annum. The rents o£ pastoral leases in the
Western Division will be fixed for the first five years, and then
increased one-fourth for the second five years, and one-half for
the residue of the term. In the Central Division the rent will
be increased one-fourth after the first five years. In the Eastern
Division the rent will be fixed for the whole term. There are
rights of renewal and many other matters of detail in connection
with this class of holding which are clearly set out by the Act
and its Regulations.
The systems of alienation are various, the principal being
by conditional freehold and conditional leasehold, the latter
being in most instances convertible into freeholds. The areas
which may be taken vary according to the Division of the
Colony in which the land may be situated, the smaller areas
being allowed in the Eastern Division, and the larger in
the Central. The land is, as a rule, more valuable for agricul-
tural purposes in the Eastern than Central Division, because
the rainfall is greater, the population denser, and the means
of reaching large markets more convenient than in the
Central. In the Eastern Division any area of land not less than
40 nor more than 640 acres can be taken as a conditional pur-
chase, for which a deposit of 2s. per acre must be paid at the
time of tendering the application for the land. Convenient forms
of application are provided, and all necessary instruction and
inform! will be given by Government agents in the various
towns throughout the Colony where land agencies are estab-
lished. The application has to come before a Board, consisting
of a Chairman (who is a salaried officer) and two other persons
selected locally by the Government from among the people.
The application, and in fact all other matters connected with
land, rents, fences, &c., &c., are considered by this Board in open
Court, the proceedings of which are regulated in the same way as
a Court of Justice, and the several parties concerned can call and
examine and cross-examine witnesses, and may appear by counsel,
attorney, or agent if they desire to do so. When the application
for a conditional purchase comes on for investigation before a


Board, if it be confirmed tbe purchaser must go into possession
and faithfully fulfil the condition of residence for five years.
He must also fence the outside boundaries of his land within
two years from confirmation of his application, unless for
sufficient cause shown, the Board extend the period within which
he may fence. At the end of three years the conditional pur-
chaser must make a solemn declaration before a Magistrate that
he has so far fulfilled the conditions of residence and fencing;
and at the end of the fifth year he must make another declaration
that he has fulfilled all the conditions which the law imposes,
except the payment of balance of purchase money. If the Board
be satisfied that all the conditions have been fulfilled, it can issue
a certificate to that effect, and this certificate will be, to all
intents and purposes, sufficient to prove that the holder’s title
is good, if he continues to pay the necessary annual instalments.
When the purchaser makes the declaration at the end of three
years, he must lodge it with the Grovernment Land Agent and
an instalment of Is. per acre on the land declared upon, and
must annually pay a like instalment till the balance of 17s. and
interest at the rate of 4 per cent, be paid. At the end of five
years from confirmation of application, the purchaser can, if he
desire to do so, pay off the balance in full.
In addition to the conditional purchase, the purchaser can
get, by another application, a conditional lease of three times
the area of his purchase, provided that the area of his purchases
and leases taken together do not exceed 1,280 acres in the
Eastern Division. This conditional lease will be subject to an
annual rental of not less than 2d. per acre, any higher rate being
assessed by the Board. The land must be fenced, but one out-
side fence will answer for the conditional purchase and con-
ditional lease. At the end of five years from the date when the
application for the lease was approved, if all things necessary
have been done, the holder of the land can convert it into a con-
ditional purchase without further residence, or he can renew the
lease for another five years, but at the end of that term his right
to the land in any form will cease. The same law holds good in


the Central Division, except that the area of the purchase and
lease is extended to 2,560 acres.
In the "Western Division land cannot he conditionally
purchased (except within any special area proclaimed as
such), and therefore there cannot be any conditional leases
of the classes spoken of above. A new class of settler
is, however, let into this Division of the Colony. He is
denominated a homestead leaseholder. He can get an area of
not less than 5,7G0 acres, and not more than 10,240 acres ; but
this leasehold must be taken within that portion of country
resumed by the Government from the old run, and not within
the new pastoral lease. The homestead lessee must fence his
land and reside upon it for six months out of every year for the
first five years, and must enter upon occupation within ninety
days of approval of his application. The annual rental for this
class of holding is the same as for a pastoral lease, not less than
Id. per acre, and the tenure is for fifteen years, with the same
right of renewal as for a pastoral lease, namely, five years more.
At the termination of all leasehold tenures the land reverts to
the Crown.
A person who wishes to obtain a conditional purchase with-
out residence can take up any area not less than 40 nor more
than 320 acres. This class of purchaser must fence his land,
and expend £l per acre on improvements, other than fencing,
within five years from date of purchase. The deposit and all
subsequent instalments upon these purchases are to be double
the amounts paid upon ordinary conditional purchases. The
holder of one of these purchases cannot take up a conditional
purchase of any other kind, nor can a person who has previously
taken up an ordinary conditional purchase take up a non-
residential one, A conditional lease cannot be granted by virtue
of a non-residential purchase.
Lands may be sold also by the Government at auction, at
an upset price of not less than £1 ss. per acre ; but not more
than 200,000 acres can be sold in one year throughout the


Colony. Land may be specially alienated on a Gold-field.
"When gold is discovered on Crown Lands, people settle down
hurriedly and erect residences and places o£ business, and, under
certain conditions and limitations, the law permits the occupants
to purchase small areas upon which their improvements stand.
Land can also be obtained as leasehold in various ways ; as for
instance annual leases for grazing purposes, in areas not exceed-
ing 1,920 acres ; and special leases of limited areas for a term
of years for almost every known purpose which can benefit the
community.
The area of the Eastern Division of the Colony is 60,452,000
acres; the Central, 55,460,000 acres; and the Western,
79,970,000 acres. These figures are approximate. The areas
alienated out of these vast Divisions are about, in the Eastern,
one-third; in the Central, between one-third and one-fourth;
and in the Western, only a little more than one-fortieth. The
total area of the Colony is about 198,848,000 acres, of which
not more than 38,000,000 acres have been alienated.
Roads, Railways, and Tramways.
At present New South Wales is expending three millions
annually on permanent public works. More than 23,522 miles
of common roads are open, affording intercommunication with
every part of the interior, and greatly facilitating the carrying of
farm and other produce to the best markets. About £5,000,000
have been spent in ten years on common roads alone, and con-
struction is still rapidly going on. Mail coaches run through
every district. During the last quarter of a century more than
50 miles of public bridges have been constructed. About 5,000
miles of road are metalled, 1,600 miles are graded mountain
passes, and the remainder for the most part drained and cleared,
with bridges where required. There are eighty-seven public
ferries, four of which are worked by steam, and the number is
yearly increasing, notwithstanding that many of the most impor-
tant are being replaced by iron and stone bridges.


The first movement for introducing railways into New South
Wales took place in 1846, when a private Railway Company was
formed. The Company, however, was unsuccessful, and in 1855
the railways passed into the hands of the Government, the first
line being opened in September, 1855, Since then all the main
lines and principal branches have been undertaken by the Govern-
ment. The progress of construction in the earlier years was slow,
owing to the great difficulties that had to be overcome, particu-
larly in the crossing of the mountain ranges. In 1875—20 years
after the initiation of railways—only 437 miles were open, but in
1886 the mileage had increased to 1,892. The two main lines, start-
ing from Sydney, are known as the Great Southern and Western
systems—the former runs to Albury, the Border City, and there
connects with the Victorian System, affording direct communica-
tion with Melbourne. It lias several large branches, the longest
running to Hay, 454 miles from Sydney. The Western line
runs to Bourke—the capital of Central Australia—so 3 miles
from Sydney. Its principal branch is the line to Mudgee,
The Great Northern line starts from Newcastle, and has been
opened to Tenterfield, a distance of 381 miles in a northerly
direction, and to Narrabri, 252 miles to the north-west. A line
is now in course of construction from the Southern Railway near
Sydney, to connect with the Northern Railway near Newcastle,
and the first section to the River Hawkesbury has been com-
pleted and opened for traffic, and within a few weeks the section
from Newcastle will be opened, which will give direct communica-
tion between the Southern and Northern systems, with the
exception of the crossing of the River Hawkesbury, which will be
accomplished by steamer until the bridge is completed. The river is
to be crosssed by a magnificent iron bridge—the largest in the
Southern Hemisphere—and the sinking of the foundations for the
bridge is the deepest for similar work in the world. The cost will
be about £350,000, and the bridge is to be completed by the close
of 1888. The Northern line is now being continued from Tenter-
field to the borders of Queensland, 12 miles from Tenterfield, where
already the line from Brisbane extends, so that in a few months’
time uninterrupted railway communication will exist between
Brisbane and Newcastle, to be extended to Sydney as soon as the
Hawkesbury River is spanned by the bridge above referred to.


The number of miles of railway opened during the year 1886
was 160, including extensions to Gundagai, Tenterfield, and
Cowra. In addition to this, 268 miles of railway are in course of
construction, and Parliament has authorized the construction of a
further 1,260 miles. The Great Southern and Great Western
lines and the Great Northern line are, as already mentioned, to
be connected by a junction railway which will unite the whole
railway system of the Colony, and when the gaps are filled up, com-
plete railway connection will be established between the four
principal Colonies on the Australian continent. Coast lines run-
ning north and south from the capital, and branches to act as
feeders to the main lines, are being extended in various direc-
tions. In all, there were at the close of 1886, 1,892 miles of
railway open in New South Wales.
The railways in the Australasian Colonies, with small exceptions,
belong to the State, and prove of incalculable value in opening up
the inland districts of the various Colonies, settlement and pro-
gression going hand in hand with the extension of the railways.
In 1886 the entire earnings of the railways of New South
Wales were £2,160,070, and the working expenses £1,492,992,
yielding a net return of £667,078, or 2-90 per cent, on the capital
invested, which amounted to £22,991,125. The total amount of
money expended on Government Railways in New South Wales
to the end of 1886 on lines open for traffic was £24,079,555.
The railways of the Colony, constructed on the standard guage
of 4 ft. 81 in., are amongst the most substantial in the world,
some of the iron bridges and viaducts being extremely costly.
The Zigzag, which occurs on the Great Western line, near the
summit level (3,700 feet), is a skilful engineering work. The
highest level of the rails above sea level is reached at Ben
Lomond, on the Northern Railway, the height being 4,528 feet.
In order to accommodate the great passenger traffic to the
Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, a steam tramway was
laid down from the Redfern Railway Station to the vicinity of the
Garden Palace, and the success attending the experiment led to
the construction of tram lines to several of the suburbs of the
city. Twenty-seven miles of city and suburban tramways were


open in 1886, tlie capital cost being £854,260. The number of
fares collected during 1886 was 53,973,311. During 1886
the tramway coaching receipts were £234,143, and the expenditure
£210,197. In addition to the city and suburban tramways, a
tram was laid down between Campbelltown, a station on the main
Southern Railway, and Camden, a distance of 8 miles. This line
was constructed as an experiment, in order to see if branch lines
in the shape of tramways could be advantageously worked as
feeders to the main lines of railways. The Camden line in 1885
returned over 3 per cent, upon its cost, and has to some degree
developed traffic for the main line.
Municipalities.
The rateable value of municipal property in New South "Wales
is increasing at a rapid ratio. In 1885 the one hundred boroughs
and municipalities of New South Wales collected a total revenue
of £815,274. Sydney alone obtained £341,670, including the
rates for water and sewerage services. The estimated annual
value of rateable property in the country municipalities amounted,
for 1885, to £1,713,578, andin Sydney and Suburbs to £3,778,002,
a grand total of £5,491,580.
Post Offices and Telegraphs.
Wherever there is a township there is a post office, and every
village in the furthest interior has its postal communication.
The postage on letters within Australia is 2d. per oz., while
newspapers are carried free. The average number of letters
posted in the Colony in proportion to its population in 1885 was
forty-tw'o to each person, —a fact which indicates much com-
mercial activity and intelligence.
Telegraph lines intersect the country in every direction.

Telegrams from all parts of the world are daily published in
the newspapers.
Education.
The Educational System of New South Wales is under the
control of the Minister of Public Instruction. Teachers are
recognized as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The
school fee is 3d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid
into the Treasury as revenue. In 1886 there were 2,170 State
Schools, in operation, namely, eight High Schools,four for boys and
four for girls, thirty-seven Superior Public Schools, 1,550 ordinary
Public Schools, 291 Provisional Schools, 150 Half-time Schools,
fifty-eight House-to-house Schools under itinerant teachers,
and twenty Evening Public Schools. The Colony is appor-
tioned, for purposes of school inspection, into a metropolitan, a
sub-metropolitan, and seven country districts, under an Inspec-
toral Staff, consisting of a Chief Inspector, a Deputy Chief In-
spector, District Inspectors, Inspectors, and Assistant Inspectors.
Two Training Schools for candidate teachers —male and female—
are also under the supervision of the Chief Inspector and his
assistants. A Chief Examiner and two assistants report upon
the papers of teachers seeking classification or promotion. A
School Attendance and Payments Officer, with forty-nine assistants,
attends to the payment of fees and to the obligatory attendance
of children between six and fourteen years of age; provision
being made for educating children whose parents are unable to
pay fees, and children who are neglected. The Colony has also
been divided into Public School districts, with one Local Board
appointed for each district. Additional Boards are being ap-
pointed where necessary, so that each Board may have the super-
vision of only a small number of schools. School buildings are
erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denomi-
national Schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but
general religious instruction is provided for. It may be imparted


by tbe State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations
are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religions instruction
in tbe tenets of their respective Churches. Since 1861 Parlia-
ment has voted nearly £6,800,000 for Primary Schools, giving
an average of about £254,166 per annum, or 9s. per head of
the mean population. Por the year 1885, the Parliamentary
grant for public instruction was about £659,000, or 12s. 2|d. per
head of population. One of the best proofs of the educational
progress of New South Wales is shown by the fact that the per-
centage of illiterates over ten years of age to the total population
declined from 29'57 per cent, in 1861, to 2274 in 1871, and to
1451 in 1881. In 1886, 186,126 children attended the ordinary
State Schools, and 760 were inmates of the Orphan Schools,
Industrial Schools, and the School for the Deaf and Dumb and
the Blind. In 1886, private schools, including church schools,
showed an attendance of about 36,000 children. In 1882, State
aid was withdrawn from all church schools. The Parliamentary
grant for 1886 for Orphan Schools and Industrial Schools, and
for the School for the Deaf and Dumb, was about £II,OOO ; a
vote of £75,000 was available towards the forming and erection
of a Reformatory for Boys ; and for the State Children’s Relief
Board, under which orphan and neglected children are boarded
out among respectable families throughout the Colony, the grant
is £19,740.
The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the
State in 1851. Its State endowment was originally £5,000, but
is now £12,000 per annum —£5,000 additional having been voted
in 1882,- and £2,000 more in 1883. The endowment is largely
added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The
Parliamentary grant for 1886 —inclusive of endowments, and
grants for additional lecturers, for scientific apparatus, for
repairs, and for additional buildings —amounts to nearly £19,000.
Three Denominational Colleges are affiliated to the University,
each having State endowment of £SOO per annum. The Sydney
University has the power of granting degrees in Arts, Law,
Medicine, and Science. Recently several Paculties have been


added to its curriculum. Graduates are entitled to the same
rank, style, and precedence as those o£ Universities within the
United Kingdom. In the metropolis there is a Public Grammar
School, attended annually by about 500 pupils, and having a
State endowment of £1,500, and a total vote for 1886—
for endowment and salaries —of £2,850. There is also a
Technical College for working-men, and in the Country towns
there are about 150 Mechanics’ Schools of Arts. Parliament
voted for 1886 nearly £17,000 towards the support of Schools
of Arts; and for technical instruction —in the College and in
connection with the Schools of Arts and the Evening Public
Schools—a grant of £17,000 was available. A Board of Technical
Education, consisting of eighteen members, with Mr. Edward
Combes, C.M.G., M.P., as President, has been constituted for
the purpose of establishing a State system of technical education
in the Colony. There are also a E-oyal Society, a Medical, a
Linnean, a Zoological, and an Art Society, with many other
educational associations of a like character. Eor the Sydney
Free Library a grant of £7,685 was voted for 1886 ; for the
Museum and Technological Museum, £11,075 ; and for the
Pine Art Gallery —for the purchase of works of Art, and for
buildings, &c. —£9,000, The Pine Art Gallery of New South
Wales is a kindred institution to the English National Gallery
and already there has been made an excellent and varied
collection of paintings, drawings, and sculpture, to which
the admission is free. Por the Art Gallery the Government
has erected a substantial structure, and it is intended that
eventually an edifice shall be erected worthy of its great object
and of Australia. The Art Society of New South Wales has
exhibitions of original productions twice a year, and has become
the nucleus of an Australian School of Art.
The total State grant available for 1885 for educational pur-
poses —as enumerated in the foregoing statement —was about
£761,850.


Social Condition .
Nearly all European institutions have firmly rooted themselves
in Australia. All phases o£ society and every religious sect
have their representatives here, as in England. Every tiown,
and almost every interest, has its newspaper ; and Banks have
been established wherever a competent population has concen-
trated. The laws are efficiently administered, and life and
property are eminently secure. The means of gaining a liveli-
hood are comparatively easy, and in sufficient variety, while the
intellectual, aesthetic, and moral progress of the Colony is
keeping pace with its industrial occupations.
The religious persuasions in New South Wales at the taking
of the Census of 1881 were as follows .-—Church of England,
342,359; Lutherans, 4,836; Presbyterians, 72,545; Wesleyan
Methodists,'s7,o49; other Methodists, 7,303 ; Congregationalists,
14,328; Baptists, 7,307; Unitarians, 828 ; other Protestants,
9,957; total Protestants, 516,512; Boman Catholics, 207,020;
Catholics undescribed, 586 ; total Catholics, 207,606; Hebrews,
3,266; other persuasions, 1,042; unspecified persuasions, 13,697 ;
Pagans, 9,345. There were in 1884 810 ministers of religion and
1,584 churches, with an average attendance at public worship of
310,197 persons. The Sunday Schools had in 1884 106,171
scholars on their registers.
Trade and Commerce,
New- South Wales is most advantageously situated for pur-
poses of trade and commerce. It is the centre of the group of
Australasian Colonies and the entrepot of the islands in the
South Pacific, the coast of the vast American continent, and is in
easy and constant communication with the continents of Asia
and America. More than one-half of the Australasian shipping is
owned in the Colony. The inward and outward tonnage of
5,439 vessels engaged in the New South Wales trade in 1886
■was 4,258,604 tons.


The prosperous advancement of the Colony is well exemplified

Although the trade between the Australasian Colonies and
Great Britain was very large, that between the Colonies them-
selves was even greater, and immense good has been effected by
this commercial interchange.
The total value of the trade in 1885 amounted to—lmports,
£23,465,190; Exports, £16,541,745; or in all £40,006,941,
with a balance in favour of Imports of £6,923,451. These
figures exhibit an import trade of £24 15s. 0 - sd. and an export
trade of £l7 Bs. ll'Sd. per head of the population, which is
higher than those of any other Colony of the Australasian
group, both in the aggregate amount and in value per head of
population. The Imports from the United Kingdom amounted
to £11.885,597, and the Exports to £7,293,133. Trade with the
other British Colonies showed—lmports, £9,041,853; and
Exports, £7,292,557. Imports from Foreign States amounted
to £2,437,746, and Exports to £1,956,055.
Foreign Imports were principally from the United States,
£1,008,572 ; France, £345,231; Germany, £372,557; Belgium,
£195,318; China, £303,595 ; Java, £25,716; New Caledonia,
£82,181; Japan, £1,242; South Sea Islands, £36,929;
Norway, £50,035; Sweden, £4,870. The Exports to the United
States were valued at £985,531; New Caledonia, £153,094;
Naples, £100,000; South Sea Islands, £68,854; Honolulu,
£10,999; Belgium, £399,549; Holland, £10,173; Germany,

The following table exhibits the increase of trade, compared
with the Census population, in decennial periods : —•
Population at Census. Trade. Per head.
£ £ s. d.
and in 1886 the total trade reached the amount of £40,006,911,
or an average of £43 per head of the mean population.
The public revenue has increased from £532,718 in 1851 to
£7,588,668 in 1885. Of the latter amount about £1,876,452
was obtained from Customs, £253,504 for stamps, and £122,694
from licenses. The land sales amounted to £1,876,452, tram-
ways £220,705, and the receipts from the national railways to
£2,271,986. The revenue from taxation is officially given at
£2 Bs. sd. per head of the population for 1885. The tariff
which is established for purposes of revenue only, is one of the
simplest in Australasia, free trade being the avowed policy of
the Colony.
The industrial stability of the Colony is manifested by the
operations of its Banks, as during the decade 1871-1881, their
progress far exceeded the increase in population, their circulation
having nearly doubled, their deposits and advances more than
doubled, and their coin and bullion reached nearly half as much
again. The increase since the last decennial period has been even
more remarkable. On the 31st December, 1886, the deposits in the
Ncav South Wales Banks amounted to £28,428,253 sterling. The
amount to the credit of 49,977 depositors in the Savings Bank of.
New South Wales on the 31st December, 1885, was £2,016,656;
and in the Money Order and Government Savings Bank Depart-
ment, £1,467,804. The deposits in all banks in the Colony at
the close of 1886 was about £28,500,000, or about £2B 10s. per
head of the population. The large amounts to the credit of the
depositors, especially in Savings Banks, clearly show the existence
of both prosperity and thrift amongst the working classes. The
Public Debt of New South Wales, on the 31st December, 1886,


amounted to £35,564,259, or £36 ss. 4'52d. per head o£ population t
and is only equal to about 4| years’ revenue at present rate.
Mail Routes .
The principal means of communication with the United King-
dom is that provided weekly via Suez and Brindisi. There are
two separate contracts supplying this weekly communication ;
one entered into in 1883, between the Government of New South
Wales and the Orient Steam Navigation Company for a fort-
nightly service; the other being a contract held for some years
past by the Government of Victoria with the Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, also for a fortnightly
service. Mails are also forwarded every four weeks, via Auck-
land and San Prancisco, by the steamers of the Union Steamship
Company of New Zealand, under contract with the Governments
of New South Wales and New Zealand; via Torres Straits, by
the Queensland Eoyal Mail steamers; via Marseilles, by the
Messageries Maritimes Company’s powerful line of steamers,
under contract with the Government of Prance; and via Suez,
by the Imperial German Mail steamers.
The average time occupied in the transit of mails between Sydney
and London and vice versa , by the most expeditious of the above-
mentioned routes (that is, via Suez and Brindisi) during the year
1886 was a little over 38 days, but this average has lately been
reduced by about 24 hours owing to the establishment of through
railway communication with Adelaide, where the New South Wales
mails are now loaded and shipped. During the present year (1887)
mails from London have been received in Sydney in 33 days —
the longest time occupied in their transit being 39 days.
Rivers and Harbours.
Nearly all the coast rivers of New South Wales are to
certain extent navigable.
The Eichmond is navigable for ocean-going vessels as far as
Lismore on the north and Casino on the south arm, each about
65 miles from the sea. The river traverses a most fertile district,
and a large trade is carried on with the metropolis.
The Clarence is one of the finest rivers on the east coast of
Australia, and is navigated by large steamers as far as Grafton


about 42 miles from the sea; small craft going as far as
Copmanhurst, 25 miles farther up.
The river is the outlet for a large and important district; and
the trade with Sydney, consisting of sugar, maize, &c., has reached
very considerable dimensions.
The Macleay, Hastings, aud Manning are also important
streams, lined with numerous wharves and shipping-places.
The Hunter, next to the Clarence is the most important river
in the Colony flowing into the Pacific; it is navigable on the
main arm as far as Morpeth, 27 miles from the sea.
The Hawkesbury, falling into Broken Bay, is the centre of a
considerable agricultural and timber district. Small craft go up
as far as Windsor, 75 miles from the sea.
To the south of Sydney the principal streams are the Shoal-
haven, Clyde, and Moruya Elvers, each of some importance.
Besides these rivers, the following are the chief ports and
harbours on this coast: —
Byron Bay, where a jetty of considerable size is being con-
structed, which is to be the terminus of the railway from
New England to the Coast, will be hereafter the outlet of the
Brunswick and Upper Eichmond Eiver districts.
Trial Bay, midway between Sydney and Brisbane, affords an
excellent refuge for all classes of ships in S. and S.E. gales. A
prison has been erected on the hill overlooking the ocean, and it
is intended to employ the prisoners on the construction of a
breakwater which will make the bay safe shelter in all weathers.
Port Stephens, 25 miles north of Newcastle, has a bold deep
water entrance, affording complete shelter inside during all
weathers, and the estuary runs into the country due west for
about 14 miles, and has a water area larger even than Port
Jackson.
Newcastle, or Port Hunter, at the mouth of the river of that
name, is the great coal port of the Colony, and is provided with
every modern steam and hydraulic appliance for loading coal.


Vessels of 4,000 tons burden can be safely berthed there. The
amount of wharfage available is about 11,000 feet lineal.
Newcastle is at present the terminus of the Great Northern
Railway, which has been constructed to within a few miles of the
Queensland border.
Lake Macquarie, a magnificent sheet of water, about 41 square
miles in area, lying about 15 miles south of Newcastle, is the
centre of a large coal basin. Extensive works for the improve-
ment of the entrance are being carried on, the effect of which
has already been beneficially felt.
Broken Bay, 16 miles north of Sydney Heads, at the mouth of
the Hawkesbury, is a fine harbour with a bold entrance, though
inferior to Port Jackson in the draught of water at the entrance.
Port Jackson —unsurpassed in the world—is separately
described on next page.
Botany Bay, 8 miles south of Sydney, receives the waters of
Cook’s and George’s Rivers, two small rivers. The area of the
bay is square miles. The northern shore is connected to
Sydney by tramway, and the available land adjacent thereto is
rapidly being built on.
Jervis Bay, a large and sheltered bay, 100 miles south of
Sydney, is at present mainly resorted to as a harbour of refuge.
Twofold Bay, to the extreme south of the Colony, is 5 miles
from east to west, and 3 miles broad. On the northern shores of
the bay stands the town of Eden, the centre of a flourishing
district, whence a large trade is carried on with the neighbouring
Colonies.
Besides the above are "Wollongong, Kiama, Ulladulla, Bate-
man’s Bay, Moruya, and Tathra, small harbours situated to the
south of Sydney, where breakwaters, wharves, and jetties
adapted to the coasting trade have been constructed. Most of
the southern ports are being connected with the metropolis by
railway.


Sydney and its Harbour,
The magnificent expanse o£ water called Port Jackson, with
its lake-like scenery, stretching for miles inland, is unrivalled
as a harbour, both for beauty and convenience. The high
and rocky coast of the Pacific is suddenly broken, and the
cliffs form a portal to an estuary of sufficient capacity to shelter
all the navies in the world. So completely is the harbour shut
in that, until an entrance is fairly effected, its capacity and safety
cannot be conjectured. A vessel making the port sails in a few
moments out of the long swell of the ocean into calm deep
water, protected on every side by high lands. The elevated shore
is broken into innumerable bays and inlets, extending inland for
miles. Some of the bays form of themselves capacious harbours.
The depth of water is sufficient for the largest ships afloat. The
harbour of Port Jackson, including a portion of the estuary of
the Parramatta Eiver, has an area of 15 square miles; Middle
Harbour, one of its arms, 3 square miles ; and the shore line of
the whole is IGS miles. Prom the Heads to the city the distance
is 5 miles, beyond which the waters extend for 8 miles further.
The breadth varies from i of a mile to 2 miles. There are
over 6 miles of Grovernment and private wharves. Deep
water extends close up to the shores, enabling the largest steam-
ships to be berthed.
The inland rivers of the Colony are marked by entirely
different features to those flowing into the Pacific, All the
rivers rising on the western side of the great dividing chain
eventually join their waters into one stream, which retains the
name of the largest of the system —the Murray Eiver. The
main branches are the Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan,
each of which is in itself a considerable river.
The Murray, the greatest of Australian rivers, is over 1,730
miles in length, and its course for 1,120 miles is in New South
"Wales territory. The river is navigable, under ordinary circum-
stances, from Lake Alexandria, where it empties itself into the
sea, to Albury, a distance of 1,410 miles, and navigation is


possible to Ournie G-old-field, 150 miles above Alburj and 1,590
miles from tbe mouth.
On the banks of this river, both in New South Wales and
Victoria, are situated some important townships, the principal of
which is Alburj, built at the point in the river first touched by
the pioneers who succeeded in crossing the continent, from
Sydney, to what is now the site of Melbourne, but which fifty
years ago was an untrodden wilderness. The railway from
Sydney to Melbourne crosses the Murray at Albury, and that
from Melbourne to Deuiliquin at Moama.
The Darling derives the great body of its waters from Queens-
land, but several considerable streams join it in this Colony.
The river may be navigated for some periods of the year as far
as the township of Walgett, a distance of 1,758 miles above
the Murray junction, and 2,345 miles from the sea. The total
course of the river, from its source to where it falls into the
Murray, is 2,700 miles. The river is tapped by the railway at
Bourke, and a line to Wilcannia is also to be constructed.
The Murrumbidgee is a fine stream, joining the Murray 700
miles from the sea; it is navigable, except in dry seasons, as far
as the township of Glundagai, 670 miles above the junction. The
total course of the river is 1,350 miles, and its principal
tributary is the Lachlan. On its banks are situated several
rising towns, the chief among wdiich is Wagga Wagga.
Sydney Water Supply.
The works for providing Sydney and its suburbs with an
abundant supply of fresh w r ater are being rapidly carried out,
and will prove invaluable to the metropolitan district for sanitary
and manufacturing purposes. The works have been conceived
on a scale of magnitude commensurate with the certain growth
of the Queen City of Australia. The source of supply is the
united waters of the Nepean, Cordeaux, and Cataract Eivers,
mountain streams fed by the abundant rain wdiich falls along the
coast district w r est of Wollongong. The wmrks consist of Ilf


miles of tunnels, one of them being 4f miles long, excavated in
the solid rock; 33i miles of open canal, 5i miles of wrought-iron
flumes —8 feet, 7 feet 6 inches, and 6 feet diameter, and 11 miles
of 48" and 42" pipes. The conduits from the point of intake to
Sydney are about 63 miles in total length. At Prospect, a point
40 miles from the farthest source, a storage reservoir, with a
capacity of 11,000 millions of gallons, is in course of con-
struction ; and the works above this reservoir are completed, and
have a maximum capacity of 150,000,000 gallons daily. The
conduits below Prospect consist of open canal, 6 feet wrought-
iron pipes, and 48" and 42" cast-iron pipes. Por nearly 10 miles
the capacity of the works is 50,000,000 gallons daily, while for
the remaining portion of 11 miles the water is delivered through
the 48" and 42" pipes, having a daily capacity of about 20,000,000
gallons.
The main portion of the line has now been completed; all that
remains to be done to connect Sydney with the Nepean and
Cataract Elvers is the laying of 5 miles of G feet pipes, which work
will be finished about June, this year (1887) ; meantime water is
being brought into Sydney at the rate of about 4,000,000 gallons a
day through a temporary pipe and fluming spanning these 5 miles.
'When completed, the works will cost a sum slightly over two
millions sterling, of which £1,412,668 have been already expended.
Besides the metropolis, the Glovernment have carried out or
sanctioned the erection of waterworks at the chief country
towns; amongst others —Newcastle, Maitland, Morpeth,and the
mining townships of the Hunter Eiver district, also Bathurst,
G-oulburn, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Deniliquin, and some others.
A sum of £500,000 has been authorized for the construction of
these works, of which £373,756 have been expended.
Pastoral Wealth and Progress.
The history of pastoral enterprise in New South Wales, con-
sidering the youth of the Colony, shows a rate of progress and
development perhaps unrivalled elsewhere. Natural pastures


exist all over the Colony, and especially westward of the Dividing
Eange, where, in average seasons, they are not to he excelled in
any part of the globe. Still further west, hardy, edible shrubs
and salsolaceous herbage of various descriptions appear, and are
found as food for stock to possess both stimulating and fattening
properties.
The security of tenure under which pastoral leases have been
granted since the introduction of the Crown Lands Act of 1884
materially enhances the value of the leaseholds, and will no
doubt conduce to a more thorough development of their
resources. The area under lease or license for pastoral purposes
is estimated to contain the bulk of the unalienated public estate,
and to be some 218,000 square miles in extent. Many of these
holdings exceed in area 300,000 acres each, some of them
reaching 000,000 or 700,000 acres.
•* The annual revenue derivable from rents and occupation license
fees of pastoral holdings, under the Act of 1884, is in process of
appraisement. Out of the total area so held there have been only
35,587,888 acres dealt with, producing a return of £138,511145. 9d.
Upon this basis the estimated annual income for 1887 from the
above sources, which is set down at £700,000 may be said to be
considerably within the limit, and nevertheless shows a very large
increase as compared with the sums paid for rents of pastoral
holdings under the repealed Acts. It may be further mentioned
that owing to the unavoidable delay in the appraisements—pending
which pastoral rents were received at the old rates—a further
amount equal to £843,090 has to be collected as the arrears
incurred in the difference between the rentals under the repealed
and present system.
Live Stock.
The fine-woolled sheep of the Colony came originally from the
choicest flocks of France, Spain, and Saxony. In the process of
acclimatization there has been a very decided improvement in the
softness, elasticity, and length of the wool, and lately, by careful
culling, a considerable increase in the weight. The average clip
is from to 6 ifes. of greasy, and about 3 lbs, of washed wool
The average lambing is 80 per cent. The total increases
in the number of sheep for the Australasian Colonies for the

twenty years from 1861 to 1880 inclusive are computed by the
Chief Inspector of Stock to he as follows:—New South Wales,
628 per cent.; Victoria, 40£ per cent.; South Australia, 112|
per cent.; Queensland, 70| per cent.; Tasmania, 4| per cent.;
New Zealand, 474 per cent.
Those who have imported and used Austrian and German rams
find that the tendency of the country and climate is to gradually
add to the length of the staple without much increasing the
stoutness of the fibre ; retaining at the same time its soundness,
softness, and colour, and even improving in that lustre and fine-
ness which makes a combing wool specially valuable. The
coarse-woolled sheep are chiefly depastured in the Coast districts,
where they thrive better than the merinos. Three-year old
wethers of this breed weigh when killed from 160 lbs. to 200 lbs.
each.
The production of wool has been largely increased in New
South Wales by fencing and subdividing the runs, utilizing the
outside country, and providing a better water supply by means
of dams and reservoirs, so that this industry is in a far better
position than it was twenty years ago. The value of the export
of wool from New South Wales amounted to £8,953,100 in 1884
for 173,986,303 lbs.; £7,201,976 in 1886 for 178,650,611 lbs.
as compared with £4,748,160 in 1871,
The export of wool was in—
In 1885 the value of pastoral exports, including wool, tallow
skins, salt and preserved meats, and live stock, amounted to
£8,867,831. Out of the 30 millions increase in the number of
live stock in the Australasian Colonies during the last decade


1876-1885), nearly 12£ millions, were additions to tlie hiead
of stock of New South "Wales, and in the last-named year
(1885) they reached 37f millions, against a total of 82i millions
for the whole of these Colonies.
The principal breeds of horned cattle are Shorthorns, Here-
fords, and Devons. A few Ayrshires have lately been imported.
The finer specimens will compare favourably with most in
England. Agricultural Societies hold yearly exhibitions of stock
and produce in the chief districts of the Colony, and some bulls
and cows have realized over 1,000 guineas each. Eoot and mouth
disease, rinderpest, and other malignant diseases of cattle are
unknown in New South Wales.
All breeds of horses thrive exceedingly well. Animals worth
£2O here average about £BO in India. India draws largely from
New South Wales for remounts for her cavalry regiments.
The following returns show the progress and resources of New
South Wales in the matter of live stock: —

It will be seen from the above returns how great is the annual
increase in stock of all descriptions, and how eminently adapted
to pastoral purposes are the vast interior plains of the Colony.
Perhaps'in no part of the world do animals thrive and fatten
more readily or with less cost than in Australia; the breeder
incurs no expense in housing or in providing fodder for the
winter, the climate being very mild throughout the year.

Agricultural Resources.
There are immense tracts of country adapted for profitable
cultivation. The operations of agriculture or husbandry are
never suspended by winter, owing to its mildness, and crops of
some sort or other may be produced in succession from January
to December.
There are now some 45,000 occupiers of land engaged in agri-
culture, or probably mixed agriculture and sheep-farming. It
should be remnmbered that this does not include pastoral tenants,
referred to at page 32. At the close of 1886 the land in culti-
vation thus occupied was returned at 977,664 acres ; enclosed by
fences, but not in cultivation, 32,356,387 acres ; and in occupa-
tion at that period but unenclosed by fencing, 3,397,286 acres.
The return for 1885-6 shows the increased total of 972,496
acres under crop.
Cereals, Fruits, Sfc.
The best wheat-growing districts are to be found on the table-
lands, from 2,000 feet to 4,000 feet above the sea-level. The
fine quality of the wheat grown on the Australian continent is
wdl known, and Hew South Wales can claim to product some of
the best samples. The yield during the season 1886-7 was 17'37
bushels per acre. The area of land in How South Wales under
grain crops and quantity of produce obtained was as follows :
Wheat, 337,730 acres, yielded 5,868,844 bushels ; maize, 146,957
acres, yielded 3,825,146 bushels; barley, 6,079 acres, yielded
132,959 bushels; oats, 23,947 acres, yielded 600,892 bushels.
The acreage and produce of hay crops was —Wheat, 74,070
acres, yielding 109,851 tons; barley, 2,095 acres, yielding 4,388
tons; oats, 126,488 acres, yielding 182,921 tons; sown grasses,
20,817 acres, yielding 52,738 tons.
Tobacco is grown chiefly in the northern coast districts and in
the south-west. The quantity produced has varied considerably
from year to year, and for 1880-7 reached 1,676,640 lbs.


Maize ig raised throughout the coast districts as far south aa
the 3Gth parallel of latitude. The cultivation is easy, and the
crop is soon ready. A failure is rarely known. The yield on
the richer descriptions of land has been 80 and 100 bushels an
acre for the first crop, and 65 bushels an acre afterwards. The
average on the whole crop of the Colony in 1866 was 262 bushels
an acre, and the total yield amounted to 3,825,146 bushels, valued
at £669,400. Large quantities are annually exported.
i Sugar-cane is now cultivated to a large extent, and the acreage
under cane increases largely year after year. In 1886-7 there
were 5,915 acres of canes cut, producing 18,811,408 lbs. The
sugar-growing districts are on the northern rivers. In 1884-5>
6,997 acres yielded 9,748 tons of sugar, at the rate of nearly
If ton per acre, and of the aggregate value of £267,000. The
sorghum or imphee, which has much saccharine matter, also
thrives well.
The cultivation of the Vine is fast becoming a leading industry
in the Colony. There are districts of sufficient area, and com-
bining the necessary conditions of soil, climate, and aspect to
produce wine enough to supply the whole of the world. The
vine was introduced by Mr. John Macarthur about 1820, and in
1831 Mr. Busby made a voyage to Europe, and brought out a
valuable collection of plants from France and from the Ehine.
This was really the parent stock of the vine in New South Wales.
Wine-growing is an industry that requires time to bring it to
perfection, but Australian wines are stated by connoisseurs to be
rapidly improving in quality. Exhibiting abroad, under many
disadvantages, colonial vignerons have won high distinction at all
the late International Exhibitions —especially at that recently
held at Bordeaux. The judges of wine at the late Sydney
International Exhibition, consisting of representatives from
every wine-producing country in the world, recorded a unanimous
opinion to the effect that Australian wines are on the whole
excellent in quality, and destined to enter into successful com-
petition in the markets of Europe, One of the judges compared


the Valleys of the Hunter and the Paterson with those of the
Gironde and the Garonne, from which the best French wines are
obtained, stating that as the climate and soil of the former are
both favourable to wine production, the wines made in the
Colony will every year become more like the celebrated vintages
of Prance. The yield of wine has averaged from 100 gallons to
700 gallons per acre, though certain kinds of grapes have pro-
duced over 1,000 gallons per acre. The area of land occupied by
vines in 1866 was 5,810 acres; the quantity of wine produced
from 3,131 acres being 601,897 gallons. Grapes for table use in
1885 covered an area of 1,291 acres, and the quantity picked
was 1,915 tons.
All the fruit of northern and southern Europe are grown
with success. The orange is cultivated most extensively, the
area so planted being 7,920 acres in 1886-7, while the fruit
gathered amounted to 6,376,868 dozens. As many as 10,000
oranges have been obtained from individual trees. Oranges
are largely exported to the neighbouring Colonies, and many
proprietors of orangeries who began life in a very small way
have realized a fortune. The olive, caper, fig, strawberry,
raspberry, gooseberry, currant, custard-apple, guava, banana,
arachis nuts, almonds, passion-fruit, loquat, quince, plum,
nectarine, pear, apple, and peach, all thrive. Gardens and
orchards covered in 1886-7 an area of 18,605 acres. Pruit is
cheap, and is consumed in large quantities by all classes.
The potato grows well, and the yield is large. Barley, oats,
&c., are grown chiefly for fodder. Lucerne hay may be cut
from four to six times in the year in favourable seasons on the
alluvial flats. Mangold-wurzel, turnips, and pumpkins are used
for the artificial feeding of the choicest cattle, but the native
grasses are quite sufficient for ordinary fattening purposes.
Arrowroot thrives; cotton succeeds well on the northern rivers.
The bark of several indigenous acacias is used for tanning pur-
poses. The Eucalypti and other native trees have valuable
medicinal properties. The Boehmeria, commonly known as the


rheea (or grass-cloth plant of China), and the New Zealand flax
are grown easily. The mulberry-tree thrives, and the finest
varieties of the silkworm have been introduced with success.
Mineral Wealth.
New South Wales abounds in minerals of commercial value.
The aggregate value of minerals raised in New South Wales up
to the end of 1886 was £69,774,187, made up of the follow-
ing amounts : —Gold, £36,469,138; silver, £580,428 ; coal,
£18,352,669; kerosene shale, £995,413; tin, £7,402,456; copper,
£4,964,250; iron, £250,922; antimony, £65,598; silver
lead, £651,511; asbestos, £488; bismuth, £13,881; and other
minerals, £25,433. During 1866, 11,620 miners were engaged
in mining for the following minerals ; —Gold, 6,767 miners ; tin,
2,794; silver, 1,297; copper, 642; iron, 120. There is no return
of those mining for other minerals. The total area under mineral
lease and application to lease in 1886 was 65,827 acres; gold
lease, 2,387 acres; and under 28th section, 99,865 acres. The
value of the minerals raised during the ten years ending 1841
was £81,275; 1851, £634,937; 1861, £14,276,637; 1871,
£16,638,574; ending 1881, £23,441,890; while for the five
years, 1882 to 1886 inclusive, the value of the minerals raised
was £14,488,616.
Gold/.
The Gold-fields extend with short intervals throughout the
entire length of the Colony. The approximate auriferous area
as far as known is about 70,000 square miles. It is highly
probable that rieh and extensive gold-fields will be discovered
for many years to come. There are immense tracts in the
interior which have not yet been prospected.
v All the principal gold-fields of the west are within two days’
journey of the capital, and there is not any mining settlement
which may not be easily reached. The gold-mining centres


present tlie appearance of orderly and thriving townships,
with schools, churches, journals, shops, and places of amusement.
The authority to dig or mine for gold costs only 10s. a year, and
entitles its possessor not only to take up ground for mining, hut
also to occupy a quarter of an acre of land for his dwelling, or a
business license, which costs £1 per annum and entitles a holder
to occupy in a town one quarter of an acre, or outside a town an
acre for a business site. Mineral licenses are also obtainable at
a cost of 20s. per year, entitling the holder to occupy from 40 to
640 acres of Crown Land for the purpose of searching for
minerals other than gold. The number of miners’ rights issued
at the several gold-fields of New South Wales in the year 1886
was 10,414. Mineral leases numbered 607, gold leases, 158 ;
authorities, 33; and business licenses, 2,040. The steam-
engines employed in quartz-mining numbered 110, with an aggre-
gate of 1,127 horse power. There were also 84 crushing-machines,
and 621 stamp-heads. In alluvial mining there were employed
34 steam-engines, with an aggregate of 311 horse power.
The quantity of gold received in 1886 for coinage at the Sydney
Mint, the produce of New South Wales, amounted to 91,854
ounces, of the gross value of £330,779, the average price per
ounce being £3 12s. Bd. The Western Districts produced
38,752 ounces, the Southern 18,763 ounces, the Northern 7,611
ounces, and localities not described 26,727 ounces. The total
quantity of gold raised in New South Wales to 31st December
1886, is 9,774,806 ounces, of the value of £36,469,138.
Silver and Lead.
Valuable lodes have been found in various parts of New South
Wales. Previous to the year 1884, the mines at Boorook were
the principal ones worked. The value of the silver produced in
the Colony during 1883 amounted to £18,503 ; but in 1884 the
argentiferous lead lodes of the Silverton district, in the Barrier
Ranges, near the Western boundary of the Colony, were opened,
and from them, during 1886, silver and silver-lead ore to the value
of £374,681 was exported. During 1885 the quantity of ore


f urnaced at the Sunny Corner mine, in the Bathurst district, was
24,547 tons, producing 634,016 ounces of silver and 6,413 ounces
of gold. The value of the silver and silver-lead ore produced in
New South Wales during the ten years ending 31st December,
1886, amounted to £1,125,081, including £492,029 produced in
1886. Much of the silver-lead ore raised in the Silverton dis-
trict was shipped to Europe for treatment; but latterly, both
at Silverton and at Sunny Corner, smelting works have been
established. Several lodes, one of which extends for one mile in
length, containing rich silver ore, chiefly fahlerz, associated with
galena and blende, are now being opened in the Vegetable Creek
district.
Coal.
The Colony of New South Wales possesses the richest, most
accessible and extensive coal and cannel-coal seams in the
Southern Hemisphere, which must ultimately make it the greatest
and richest of all the Australian Colonies. The approximate
area of the carboniferous strata is estimated at 23,950 square
miles, and thick coal seams crop out along the coast and mountain
ranges from Pier Head, near Lake Macquarie, to Newcastle
Harbour, a distance of 18 miles, on the northern edge of the great
coal basin. Workable coal seams also occur at Gunnedah in the
Northern District and at Heathcote in the Southern. Erom
Coal Cliff to near Shoalhaven, a distance of 45 miles at the
southern side of the basin, and on the western side at the Blue
Mountains, Lithgow Valley, Wallerawang, &c., thick coal and
cannel-coal seams crop out alongside the railway, and in the
gorges and gullies on each side of the line ; whilst on the Southern
and Western Railways similar outcrops of coal and cannel-coal
occur.
The mines, first opened in 1802, are situated in the immediate
vicinity of Newcastle, and it is from there that the Colony obtains
its largest supply, where the shipment of coal is carried on by
hydraulic and steam cranes, and shoots, capable of loading 16,200
tons per day.


Vertical sections and diagrams of the coal seams worked in the
northern, southern, and western districts are exhibited. The
production of coal has increased very rapidly of late years. In
1833, 328 tons were raised; whilst in 1885,2,878,863 tons, valued
at £1,340,212 were raised, at an average price of 9s. 3fd. per ton.
The coal is of excellent quality for steam, household, smelting,
and gas purposes, and the largest exports are to Victoria, Hong
Kong, San Francisco, South Australia, Manila, Japan, Valparaiso,
Honolulu, India, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Queensland, more
than 1,000 vessels being annually engaged in this traffic.
A variety of cannel-coal commonly called “ kerosene shale,”
similar to the once famous Boghead mineral of Scotland, but
yielding a much lai’ger percentage of volatile hydro-carbons than
the Scotch Boghead, occurs in saucer-shaped deposits from a few
inches to 5 feet thick. The richest quality yields upwards of 150
gallons of crude oil per ton, or 18,000 cubic feet of gas, with an
illuminating power of thirty-eight to forty-eight sperm candles ;
and on this account it is found advantageous for mixing with
ordinary coal in the manufacture of gas, and is largely exported
to Great Britain, America, and other foreign countries, as well
as the neighbouring Colonies, for gas purposes. Two Companies
manufacture petroleum oil and other products therefrom. The
quantity raised in 1886 was 43,563 tons, valued at £99,976.
Copper, Tin, SfG.
Copper lodes are found in many districts. Some of the ores
are extremely rich. The quantity of copper raised in the
Colony was 3,968 tons 18 cwt. in 1886, valued at £166,429, in
addition to 57 tons 18 cwt. of ore, and regulus valued at £1,236.
The occurrence of Tin was first made known in 1852 by the
late Eev. W. B. Clarke, but it was not commercially worked till
1872. The tin is of the very best quality, and takes rank beside
the Straits Settlements tin in the English market. Tin-mining
shows a much larger development in New South Wales during
the decade than copper-mining, and the annual value of the


metal produced now exceeds even that of the gold or other
minerals excepting coal. The quantity of tin and tin ore raised
in the Colony was 4,967 tons in 1886, valued at £467,653, against
896 tons in 1871, valued at £47,703.
Other Minerals. —Large deposits of iron ore occur in many
widely separated districts. The principal ore is hematite. In
several places there are coal, limestone, and iron in immediate
proximity. At Mittagong in the south, and Lithgow in the
west, iron ore is found in large quantities. The ores of lead,
zinc, and bismuth, occur in several localities. Cinnabar is found
in the Mudgee district. Antimony ores are being increasingly
worked in the Macleay and other districts. Diamonds, opals
rubies, sapphires, and other gems have been found in various
parts. The number of diamonds found in Hew South "Wales up
to the end of 1886 is estimated at 50,000, the largest being
one of 5| carats, or 16 2 grains. Alum stone has been found in
considerable quantity in the Bulladelah district, and is about to
be worked. Asbestos of good quality has been worked to a
small extent in the Gundagai district.
Industries and Manufactures ,
The progress of Hew South Wales in manufacturing indus-
tries is very marked. The latest and most approved labour-
saving appliances and steam-driven tools have been introduced,
and the manufacturers here are able to compete with those of
in the supply of many local requirements. Some of the
manufactures in Hew South Wales have a steady export trade,
clearly showing that the articles produced are cheaper and
better than those obtainable from any other source.
The number of manufactories and works in existence, and the
number of hands employed during the year 1886 are returned
as follows: —Connected with agricultural and pastoral pursuits,
285 establishments, employing 3,277 hands; connected with food
and drink or the preparation thereof, 810 establishments, employ-
ing 8,063 hands ; clothing and textile fabrics, 175 establishments,
employing 5,532 hands; building materials, 920 establishments,


employing 9,187 hands; metalworks, 271 establishments, employ-
ing 6,938 hands; ship-building, repairing, &c., 101 establishments,
employing 1,079 hands; furniture, bedding, &c., 146 establish-
ments, employing 1,380 hands; books, paper, printing, &c., 175
establishments, employing 3,659 hands; carriage works, 217
establishments, employing 1,917 hands; saddlery and harness, 100
establishments, employing 505 hands; miscellaneous works and
manufactories, 496 establishments, employing 4,435 hands. The
total number of works and manufactories in New South Wales
had reached in 1886 the number of 3,694 establishments, giving
employment to 45,783 persons, and the total value of the plant
or machinery being estimated at £5,801,757.
At close of the year 1886 there were in New South Wales 128
mills for grinding and dressing grain, 11 of which were not working.
The remaining 117 mills gave employment to 571 persons, and
turned out 113,302 tons of flour. The approximate value of the
machinery, plant, &c., being returned at £333,362.
The waters of the Colony abound with fish. The bays and
estuaries along the coast furnish natural oyster-beds many miles
in length. The whale-fisheries are deserving of notice, though of
late years they have been neglected.
Wine-making is a settled industry. The wines of the Albury
district, in the south, are known in all the neighbouring Colonies
as well as in London. The produce of the Hunter Eivor districts
has won medals at the Great International Exhibitions of Europe,
the production in 1886 reached 601,897 gallons of wine. The
consumption of native wines is increasing every year in Australia.
There were 74 breweries in 1886, which turn out large quantities
of beer and ale of very fair quality. 13,178,912 gallons were
manufactured in 1886.


Tobacco of local manufacture is finding its way into favour
Large quantities of Virginian leaf are imported for this pur-
pose, and the colonial-grown leaf is also much used. One of
the largest manufacturers of tobacco in the world, from Virginia
in the United States, has fitted up extensive premises in Sydney.
The quantity manufactured in 1886 was 14,970 cwt.
The meats of New South "Wales have acquired a great reputa-
tion abroad. Some of the largest steamships trading to Austra-
lian ports are provided with refrigerating chambers, in which are
stored large quantities of fresh meat, frozen in the carcass, for
European markets. Salted, preserved, and fresh meats to the
value of £182,746 were exported in 1884, and £179,307 in 1885.
The manufacture of jams and confectionery, aerated waters, &c.,
gives employment to numerous hands.
The manufacture of leather and the industries in connection
therewith employ over 3,000 hands. In 1886 the value of
colonial manufactured boots and leather exported amounted to
£216,328. Sydney carried oft many prizes and medals for such
manufactures at the Sydney and Melbourne International Exhi-
bitions.
With wool in abundance, the manufacture of cloths, tweeds,
blankets, &c., is being developed, and first awards were won for
some of these articles at the last Sydney Industrial Exhibition.
In 1886 the production was upwards of 320,000 yards of cloth
and tweeds. There are several large clothing manufactories,
giving employment to hundreds of persons.
Illuminating and lubricating oils are manufactured from kero-
sene shale. Soap is largely made, and the weight manufactured
in 1886 was 155,430 cwt. In the same year tallow was exported
to the value of £147,378, and 2,199,282 lbs, of candles were
manufactured.


Metals Earth s, SfG.
In iron the manufactures of New South Wales promise to
attain to large dimensions. The iron foundries and engineering
establishments have produced iron steamships, dredges, light-
houses, locomotives, bridges, cylindrical piers, and agricultural
implements. Every description of the heaviest kinds of rough
work, as well as the finest kinds of work required for engines, is
turned out. There are also several factories for the production
of galvanized iron. At Eskbank, Lithgow, iron has been made
from the ores, and both wrought iron and steel are being manu-
factured.
Eor reducing copper and tin ores there are numerous smelting-
works. The poorer copper ores from neighbouring Colonies are
sent to be smelted near the collieries in New South Wales. In
1886 the export of tin and copper ingots and ores w r as valued
at £635,818.
The manufacture of bricks, encaustic tiles, drain-pipes, and
other descriptions of pottery is carried on by the aid of steam-
driven machinery. There is constant building work going on in
the numerous cities and towns which are springing up in all parts
of the country. Sydney especially has of late years entered on a
course of architectural improvement, the old stores and shops
giving place to magnificent warehouses and manufactories.
Marble, granite, freestone, and limestone are to be found in
abundance in the Colony ; and work in earth and stone furnishes
employment to many thousands of masons, brickmakers, potters,
and other artisans. Infusorial earth occurs in quantity in the
Barr aba and Lower Darling districts.


Ship-building, Docks, Sfc.
There is a Government Dock at Cockatoo Island, Port Jackson,
in which H.M.S. “ Galatea,” of 26 guns and 3,227 tons, was
docked. Mort’s Dock is also capable of accommodating the
largest class of mail steamers that come to the port. The Aus-
tralian Steam Navigation Company has a slip capable of taking
up a vessel of 1,500 tons, and there are also smaller private slips
and floating docks. Another Government dock is being con-
structed at Cockatoo Island, which will take in the largest vessel
now afloat.
103 vessels were built in New South "Wales in the year 1884,
consisting of 61 steamers, 11 schooners, 1 barquantine, 4
lighters, 9 luggers, 3 cutters, and 11 ketches, showing an
aggregate of 7,663 tons. In the year 1886, 67 vessels were
built of an aggregate tonnage amounting to 3,976 tons.
There are numerous varieties of valuable timber in New South
Wales, useful for every description of ship and house building
and furniture. Already there is an export trade in cut and sawn
timber of considerable value. The export in 1884 was valued at
£102,011. There are numerous steam joineries for the supply of
woodwork of houses and of furniture. All the cabs, carriage?,
carts, drays, omnibuses, and other vehicles required are made in
the Colony, and proof of the skill of the workmen in this depart-
ment of industry may be seen in the carriages which daily run
along the thoroughfares of the capital. The area of Timber and
State Porest Deserves under the supervision of the Purest Con-
servancy Branch of the Department of Mirtes amounted in 1881
to 5,390,513 acres; part of the area, 2,174,412 acres is subject to
a royalty, and the quantity cut thereon was 14,569,035 feet,
besides 293 trees—from which the revenue was £8,392 13s. lOd.
The total revenue for timber cut from all Crown Lands being
£17,565.


Conclusion.
The object of this pamphlet is to provide such information as
will accurately describe the soil, climate, and resources of New
South Wales, as well as to show the actual progress the Colony
has already made. To accomplish this, facts and figures have
been collected from the Statistical Register, and from other
authentic sources, which will enable the reader to readily form
an opinion for himself. It is satisfactory to be able to demon-
strate that the Colony has such natural advantages in its posi-
tion, its soil, and its great wealth in coal, iron, gold, copper, tin,
and other minerals, that abundance and happiness pervade all
classes of the community, and that the materials exist for pro-
viding the like blessings to many millions ; that the country is
governed by a constitutional Government and liberal laws, which
give every possible security to life and property. With such
natural, political, and educational advantages New South Wales
has the brightest future before her, and cannot fail to become
the home of an immense population of prosperous and enlightened
people.
