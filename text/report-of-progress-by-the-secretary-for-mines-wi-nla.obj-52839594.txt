Fair progress has been made in the preparation and publication of geolo-
gical maps during the year. In continuation of the statement in the last
Report I have to remark that—
The northern sheet of the geological map of the Ararat goldfield has been
completed, and both sheets, with accompanying sections, have
been published.
The lithographing of the southern sheet of the Stawell goldfield has
been completed, and the map is nearly ready for publication.
The four sheets of the geological sketch-map of South-Western Gipps-
land have been lithographed, and the color-printing is well ad-
vanced towards completion.
The sketch geological map of the Bogong and Dargo High Plains and
adjacent country has been lithographed and partly printed.
The southern sheet of the geological map of the Creswick goldfield has
been lithographed, and proofs have been printed.
Many diagrams have also been lithographed and printed for issue with
the publications of the Department.
The surveyors, Messrs. Reginald A. F. Murray, F. Kraus6, and N. Taylor,
have been engaged during the year upon the following work :

Much time has been occupied in the completion of plans of work com-
menced in the preceding year; but, notwithstanding this, lam able to
report that about 1,210 square miles of country have been examined and
geologically surveyed with more or less topographical detail, and that the
progress made has been generally satisfactory.
Sheet No. 2, S.E. Gippsland, surveyed by Mr. Murray, shows about 1,364
square miles of country, and embraces a part of the Main Dividing Range,
and several spurs of the Australian Alps, on which are situated—Mount
Useful, 4,756 feet; Mount Wellington, 5,363 feet; Ben Cruachan, 2,800 feet;
and Mount Kent, 5,129 feet. The area also includes portions of the water-

sheds of the Goulburn, Thomson, and Aberfeldy rivers, and of Donnelly’s,
Fulton’s, Stringer’s, and Stony creeks.
About 160 square miles of the survey embraces rocks of Tertiary formation,
and the remainder rocks of the Upper and Lower Palaeozoic age, with the
exception of one small outcrop of granite, which appears from beneath the
Upper Palaeozoic rocks in the bed of one of the branches of the Avon, about
five miles south of Mount Wellington.
Mr. Murray states that the Silurian rocks form the general bases of the
country, and that a trough occupied by strata of Upper Devonian age
exists in them, extending from the western side of the Macallister to the
eastern side of the Wonnongatta River. He identifies the Silurian rocks of
the Thomson River as forming a part of the same series as those of the
Yarra and Wood’s Point districts, which are known to be of Upper Silurian
age, while those of the Wonnongatta would appear to be identical with
rocks containing Lower Silurian fossils ; he assumes, therefore, that there
is a line of demarcation between the Upper and Lower Silurian rocks that
lie beneath the Devonian rocks previously mentioned as occupying a
trough in the Silurian formations.
Mr. Murray discovered no remarkable difference in the Silurian strata as
compared with other districts ; he notes the strike and dip of rocks observed
in various parts of the survey. As a rule, the cleavage and bedding planes
of the Silurian rocks coincide, but attention is drawn to some few exceptions.
Limestone but rarely occurs, and in small patches, within the area
surveyed. It was found near the copper mine on the north-west side of the
Thomson River, on the south side of the same river about seven miles east
of the copper mine, and also about six miles easterly from Walhalla on the
west side of Duck Creek, a tributary of the Thomson River. In the last-
named locality it rests on the upturned edges of the Silurian strata, and on
that account it is provisionally classed as of Devonian age. From a small
patch of limestone on the north side of Cooper’s Creek, similarly resting on
Silurian rocks, imperfect fossils were obtained, which Professor McCoy was
able to identify as indicative of Devonian rocks.
In referring to the Upper Devonian rocks Mr. Murray alludes to the
reasons previously given by Mr. Howitt in favor of the Iguana Creek beds
and those of the Freestone Creek in the one direction, and the Snowy Bluff
in the other, being regarded as of the same series of Upper Devonian rocks,
and states that, from the result of his own observations, he considers, both
on stratigraphical and palaeontological evidence, that they are so. He
shows that about the heads of the Warrigal and Stony creeks (branches
of the Macallister) the lowest bed of the Upper Devonian rocks is a very
coarse breccio-conglomerate, made up chiefly of large angular fragments of
the Silurian rocks ; on this rest sandstones, shales, &c., followed by
massive porphyritic felsite of great thickness, on which lie the varying
sandstones, conglomerates, and shales forming the sedimentary portion of
the series.


Mr. Murray illustrates in figures Nos. 6 and 7 the mode of occurrence of
the Devonian rocks, and shows the result of a microscopical examination
of specimens of the same rocks by Mr. Howitt. A general description is
also given of the characteristics of the Devonian rocks extending over the
survey, together with interesting sketch-sections.
Mr. Murray mentions that the Macallister River, some distance above
Glencairn, trends from a northerly to an easterly direction for several
miles, and that it passes through deep gorges and precipitous mountains,
walled in by cliffs of mudstones, shales, and sandstones of the Devonian
series. Above these gorges are small open, gently undulating plains,
covered with “ snow grass,” through which the river wends, and the sur-
rounding tributary gullies contain moss beds and never-failing springs of
water. Mount Tamboritha, whose height above the sea-level is 5,381 feet,
appears only as a high hill overlooking this elevated tract of land. Mr.
Murray relates that, in following along the summit of the range from Mount
Crinoline to Mount Tamboritha, he and his companion, while suffering from
severe thirst, determined to descend the mountain side to cascades which
they saw in the Macallister River some 1,500 feet below, and that, after
scrambling down about half-way, they accidentally discovered a spring of
pure ice-cold water issuing from the rock with great velocity, and in a volume
equal to two sluice-heads of water, or about 400 gallons per minute.
This stream is supposed to have a subterranean communication with the
country in which the elevated plains previously referred to are situated.
Mr. Murray alludes to the existence of serpentine and chrome-iron in
country west of the range between Mount Hump and Mount Wellington ;
he also refers to the occurrence among the Devonian rocks of good beds of
sandstone adapted for building purposes. A superior description of hard
fissile grit, suitable for flagging, is said to be found at Nicholson’s Creek.
No indications of coal were seen in the Devonian rocks, but a little fine
gold was found at Nicholson’s Creek and a few other places.
Mr. Murray calls attention to patches of Miocene Tertiary at Connor’s
Plain, on the Dividing Range between the Darkly and Black rivers, at Ful-
larton’s, Spring Hill, and at Mount Useful, all of which underlie basalt,
and consist of conglomerates, clays, sands, and gravels, more or less
cemented, resting on Silurian rocks. The country under notice bears geo-
logical evidence of very extensive denudation ; and as regards the elevated
and isolated patches of Miocene Tertiary, it is assumed that, after the
Upper Palaeozoic (Devonian) rocks had been deposited on the great
Silurian and granite rock foundation, they were removed by denuding
agencies from all but the deeper hollows and troughs of the Silurian in
which they lay. Sections are presented showing the existing rock formations,
also ideal sections (Figs. 15 to 18 inclusive), illustrative of the country at
various stages during the period of denudation.
An extract is given from Professor Jukes’ Manual of Geology, 3rd edition,
page 690, describing the denuding agencies that have been in operation in the


Hebrides, in order to show how exactly it appears to describe geological condi-
tions existing in Gippsland. The operation of the agencies described by Professor
Jukes, though not so striking in extent and grandeur, are similarly exhi-
bited in other parts of Victoria where Silurian rocks prevail, and particu-
larly so along the valleys of the Loddon and Campaspe, where the lava-flows
were originally contracted in width by closely bounding higher country, and
where they now stand out in bold relief as elevated plateaux, capping
Tertiary deposits, although cut through in many places by denuding
agencies.
Mr. Murray furnishes elaborate notes on the quartz mining operations:
within the tract of country embraced in his survey. In relation to “ alluvial”
mining, the subject is disposed of in a short paragraph, describing the
general exhaustion of the auriferous deposits in the beds of rivers and creeks,
or in the terraces along their banks. It is probable that tracts containing
these deposits yet remain to be discovered, but it is not considered that
they are likely to be of much importance to the miner.
It is upon the development of quartz mining that the main hopes of
the future mining prosperity of the district are said to be based. In re-
ferring to the seven groups of auriferous quartz veins existing in Victoria,
as described in the paper by Mr. Nicholas, F.G.S., published in the Progress
Report No. IV., Mr. Murray points out that a portion of the lodes of one of
these groups is to be found in the country shown in his sheet. These lodes
lie in two separate belts, in one of which occur the reefs at Donnelly’s
Creek, and in the other those at Aberfeldy and Walhalla. In the former no
dykes of any kind have been seen, either in or near the quartz workings, but
in the latter the lodes accompany, and are often found in conjunction with,
well-defined dykes of felstone and diorite.
Sketch-sections are produced, showing peculiarities in the occurrence of the
reefs without dykes at Donnelly’s Creek. These reefs vary in thickness from
a few inches to several feet, and though very rich in places, the gold is dis-
tributed somewhat irregularly in the veins. The mountainous nature of the
country favors the working of the lodes by tunnels or adits from the steep
sides of the hills. Illustrations are given of some of the adits and of the
character of the lodes they intersect. The most valuable vein-stone in the
Donnelly’s Creek mines is usually well laminated, and contains galena,
zincblende, and iron and copper pyrites.
As regards the quartz veins associated with diorite dykes, Mr. Murray
supplies sketches (Figs. 31 and 32) and descriptions of the mines on the
watershed of the Aberfeldy River.
The reefs at Walhalla are in the same belt as those just referred to, and
those known as Cohen’s, Longfellow’s, Happy-go-Lucky, and Fear-not, are
also similarly associated with intrusive dykes. Numerous drawings are
given (Figs. 33 to 48) showing details both in longitudinal and cross section
of the veins on the Cohen’s line, on which the workings of the celebrated
Long Tunnel Company and of the Walhalla and North Gippsland companies


are situated. Much gold has been obtained from the former; and in re-
ferring to the characteristics of the vein-stone, Mr. Murray says that the
presence of arsenical pyrites in the associated dyke is regarded as an un-
failing indication of the proximity of good quartz in the lodes. Bournonite,
iron pyrites, and galena are said to he plentiful in the vein-stone. Figures
49 to 53, and 56 to 69, contain excellent illustrations of lodes on various
lines of reef at Walhalla.
The Walhalla copper mine is described as occurring in a diorite dyke,
about four miles distant from Walhalla. The dyke stone contains much
hornblende, with copper pyrites disseminated and in veins ; the pyrites near
the surface has decomposed and become converted into carbonates, sulphates,
and oxides of copper, with which is associated brown iron-ore, produced by
the decomposition of iron pyrites. The ore-bearing portion of the dyke is
about 120 feet long, and about 25 feet wide at the surface. Illustrations
and detailed descriptions are given of the mine, and its prospects from a
commercial point of view are considered to be of a favorable character.
Mr. Murray offers suggestions for the future prospecting of the country
for gold, which may be briefly summed up as follow, viz., that the allu-
viums in the creeks and gullies intersecting lines of reefs already proven at
various points along their courses to be auriferous, should be examined, and
that when gold is found careful search should be made in the immediate
vicinity for reefs or lodes.
Mr. Murray mentions, as sites offering favorable indications for prospecting
operations, the country lying between the Donnelly’s Creek reefs and the
Boy Reef, the Walhalla belt of reefs, the country on the fall from the Mount
Useful range to the Macallister River, and that lying between the Macallister
and Thomson rivers, the gravels beneath the basalts of Fullarton’s Hill,
Connor’s Plain, head of Cooper’s Creek, &c.
It is remarked that the general appearance of the reefs is greatly in favor
of the theory, that veins of quartz and their contained metals and minerals
were segregated from the surrounding rocks into fissures and cracks ; and
it is pointed out that the fissile character of the Silurian rocks admits of
fissures of great length along the strike of the uplifted beds.
Mr. Krause has furnished a supplementary report upon his survey of the
Creswick goldfield bearing upon the auriferous leads of the Middle Pliocene
age, and particularly upon the following known leads and their tributaries :
Sulky Gully, Bald Hill, Cobblers and Diamond Gully, Red Gully, Nuggety
Gully, Creswick, Doctor’s, Spring Gully, and Separation; the Flat leads
lying between Broomfield and Frenchman’s gullies, Springhill, Lewers and
Hawkins leads. The four latter have been recently opened, and in many
instances with highly successful results.
The Sulky Gully Lead, which takes its rise on the south side of the Main
Dividing Range, passes under that range into the opposite watershed area,
after a course of little over one mile from its source. The ancient Divide in
this locality would seem to have been situated to the southward of the one


at present existing, the configuration of the country having been greatly
altered by points of volcanic eruption and lava-flows. Such instances of
auriferous leads, trending from one watershed area to another, are not un-
common in Victoria, and descriptions of two others will be found in this
Report, one by Mr. Krause, relating to the W omhat Hill Lead, and another
by Mr. R. A. F. Murray, in his account of the Dargo High Plains in Gipps-
land. The latter furnishes evidence of the entire removal of mountains by
the sweeping changes effected by denudation.
Many of the leads described by Mr. Krause have been traced for distances
varying from one to nine miles, and their lower portions enter beneath the
basaltic tract lying to the north and north-west of Creswick. These latter
are much the more costly to "work, inasmuch as the hard nature of the
basaltic rocks causes the sinking of shafts to be attended with difficulty ;
another reason is that greater quantities of water are found in the drifts,
owing to the low level of the country and its distance from the heads of
the watershed. In addition, it may happen that the leads increase in width,
and their gravels being more widely distributed contain less gold. Under
these circumstances the miners are perhaps unable to continue their opera-
tions with profit, and consequently suspend, or altogether abandon work,
although, if the leads were traced further along their downward courses,
they would likely be found to be again contracted in width, and to be
enriched by auriferous tributary gutters, inasmuch as the trend of the
main drainage lines of the country is directly conformable to the course
of the auriferous belt of reefs, which no doubt extends from Creswick to
Clunes, and from which the leads, so far as they have been traced, have
received their quartz and gold.
In speaking of the probable direction of the Sulky Gully and Bald Hill
leads, from the points where the miners have ceased to work them, it is said
that they probably effect a junction immediately north of Mount Hollow-
back ; but the country to the north-west presents for many miles an unbroken
sheet of lava, offering no features to indicate the actual position of the lead
lying beneath it. Its position can therefore be only determined by boring
or sinking.
The further trend downwards of the united course of the Diamond Gully
and Long Point leads is supposed to be north-easterly, towards the Red
Streak Lead. The principal lead of the goldfield—the Creswick and Black
Lead—has been traced a distance of about miles from the Dividing
Range. It receives a number of important tributaries, and its course has
been determined a considerable distance beneath the basalt—as far down as
the mine of the Australasian Company. Attempts have been made to define
the channel of the lead below this part, and a series of bores is said to
have proved pretty conclusively that its position may be looked for at a
point midway between the No. 1 and No. 2 shafts of the Consols Company.
It is generally supposed that the lead then continues in a northerly course
across the Glendonald Creek, half a mile west of Swan Hill, and that it


joins the Springhill Lead west of Wheeler’s Bridge. Mr. Krause, however,
calls attention to a narrow belt of Upper Pliocene clay drift, lying between
smooth Silurian hills, and stretching westward along the Gdendonald Creek to
Creswick Creek, and considers it of importance that the depth of the
deposit should be ascertained, as in the present uncertainty there is no
gainsaying the supposition that the Australian Lead may follow the course
of the Glendonald Creek to Creswick Creek, and re-enter the basalt under
the Racecourse Reserve. I doubt if the onward course of the lead will be
found to follow the direction last suggested. I favor the general supposi-
tion that it takes a northerly course from the mine of the Australasian
Company.
In reference to Doctor’s Lead, Mr. Kraus6 remarks that the tongue of
lava occupying the ridge dividing the Adekate from the southern arm of the
Back Creek and the narrow outliers west of the first-named stream doubt-
less cover an old lead valley, the existence of which has hitherto escaped the
attention of the miner.
The Flat leads lying between Broomfield’s and Frenchman’s gullies have
been abandoned by the miners for about eighteen months, and their down-
ward courses have yet to be determined. Mr. Krause thinks that they will
eventually be found to unite in one main arm bearing westerly, and then
north-westerly towards the Consols Company’s ground, joining the Aus-
tralasian Lead east of their No. 2 shaft.
The consideration of the recently discovered leads underlying the basaltic
tract at and near Springhill next calls for attention. Of these, Mr. Krause
mentions that the German Gully and Broomfield leads, after uniting, will
probably be found to join with the Trunk (Springhill) Lead in Dyke’s
freehold.
As regards the Springhill Lead, it is said that in the mine of the Baron
Rothschild Company a length of 1,400 feet of the gutter was blocked out in
thirteen months—from May 1875 to June 1876—and that the gold obtained
amounted to 14,387 oz. 10 dwt. 16 grs., realizing £57,175 Is. lid., leaving
a profit of £38,550, after payment of all working expenses, including ma-
chinery and plant. Extensive deposits of gravel drift (reef-wash) exist on
the sides of the lead, but they have not been hitherto found to pay the
expense of working them.
Fine rolled grains of native copper are rather abundantly distributed
through the gravels of the Springhill Lead, but, with the exception of this
and some titaniferous iron-sand, the gravels contain few traces of minerals
other than gold. The gold is of superior quality, from 23 to carats fine.
Ryan’s Junction Company have at the present time the most advanced
workings on the Springhill Lead; there are but few natural features to
indicate the course of the auriferous drift beyond their mine ; it is, however,
considered likely that the lead, joined by the De Murska Lead, will be found
east of McDonald’s Hill, and that it will thence trend in a northerly direc-
tion under the plateau between the Tullaroop and Middle creeks.


Lewers Lead, so far as wrought, extends in a northerly direction from
Springhill about 1| miles to its junction with Hawkins Lead, about 240
yards north of the Kingston Park shaft. The upper portion of the lead is
only from 20 to 30 feet wide ; but 250 feet north from the shaft of the
Richardson Junction Company it falls rapidly, and expands to a width
of 150 feet. At this place large quantities of water were found in the
drifts, and a falling-off in the auriferous quality of the gravel, caused
the workings to be abandoned, leaving some portions of the gutter un-
touched.
Hawkins Lead has been traced a distance of about two miles in a northerly
and north-westerly direction from Springhill down to the shaft of the He
Murska Company, where it is found at a depth of 198 feet beneath the
basaltic plain. From this point Mr. Krause is of opinion that it will
probably trend in a north-westerly direction, south of Birch’s Bald Hill,
and towards the Bullarook Creek, near Wheeler’s Bridge. He shows by a
diagram and description that there are two distinct flows of lava covering
this lead. The gutter varies from 20 to 100 feet in width in the upper, and
from 70 to 200 in the lower portion ; along its eastern edge terrace drift
is found, yielding in some places satisfactory returns.
In addition to the leads already mentioned, it is said that the existence of
a deep channel has recently been established by a shaft sunk on the south-
eastern slope of Springhill, and it is probable that a lead will he found
there bearing northerly for about a mile in the direction of the Kingston
Road, and thence north-westerly towards Birch’s Bald Hill, in the vicinity
of which it may join the Hawkins Lead.
About three-quarters of a mile north-west of the village of Bullarook, in
the valley of the Bullarook Creek, a bore was put down to a depth of about
300 feet from the surface to the bed-rock, and specks of gold are said to have
been obtained from the hore-meal got from the lower gravel drift. This deep
ground is supposed to he a continuation of the Rocky Lead lying to the
southward.
Mr. Taylor, in his annual report, describes the work executed by him
during the last year, viz., the completion of the Learmonth sheet, the survey
and planning of the granite boundaries near Buninyong East (Yendon), the
plotting of land surveys within the Clunes sheet, and the geological survey
of about 84 square miles of country within the limits of that sheet.
In the additional notes on the Learmonth survey, referred to in last year’s ]
Report, Mr. Taylor has furnished full descriptions of the lithological character
of the rocks to which reference numbers are given on his plan.
In describing some bores sunk by Mr. Bath, near the Burrumbeet Creek,
north of Tin-pot Hill, he remarks there is a possibility that the auriferous
leads found in the mines of the City of Ballarat and Great North-West
companies may trend northerly, and nearly follow the course of the Burrum-
beet Creek, through the southern portion of the area shown on the Learmonth
sheet, and thence pass southerly towards Lakes Burrumbeet and Carngham.
c
Learmonth.


This opinion appears to he based on the fact that the bottoms of the bores
sunk by Mr. Bath are about at the same level as the bottom of the shaft
of the City of Ballarat Company, but Mr. Taylor makes no allowance for
the natural fall of the lead in its downward course. He mentions that, should
the lead be found near the site of Mr. Bath’s bores, any tributaries coming
in from the north and east would not be likely to be auriferous, because the
country underlying the basalt in that direction must be of granitic formation,
as proved by the ejected masses of granite on all the volcanic points of
eruption as far east as Mounts Cavern and Blowhard.
Supplementing his additional notes, Mr. Taylor furnishes descriptions of
167 specimens of rocks obtained from various parts of the Learmonth
survey, forwarded to the Office of Mines for reference purposes. Several of
the descriptions are from microscopic and other examinations of the speci-
mens made by Messrs. Ulrich and Newbery.
In the course of the late prospecting operations at Buninyong, described
in another part of this Report, it became apparent that the boundaries of
the granite and Silurian rock formations in that locality, as laid down on
the Geological Sketch-map of Victoria, required revision; Mr. Taylor was
therefore instructed to trace and define the boundaries of the former from
the edge of Mr. Murray’s previous survey of the Ballarat goldfield, so far
as it might be necessary to effect corrections. This work has been satis-
factorily accomplished. (See Plan and Report annexed.)
Mr. Taylor remarks that the area of granite shown on the plan is part of
the same mass as that existing at the Gong Gong reservoir, being merely
separated from it superficially by a basaltic overflow from Mount Warren-
heip in the north-west. The boundaries of the granite, and also of the
basalts in parts of the survey, are much obscured and difficult to define on
account of deposits of surface drift..
Little need be said about the basalt-flows : they have their sources at
Mount Warrenheip and at the Black and Green hills. The thickness of
the basalt disclosed at the Lai Lai Falls is about 130 feet, but this does not
represent its actual thickness, as the bottom of this rock is not visible below
the Falls.
About Lai Lai occurs a basin in which there is a considerable deposit of
lignite about 140 feet in thickness, and in the same locality are round
swamps surrounded by sand ridges, which present a very coast-like
appearance.
Mr. Taylor says that the drifts to the north of the area surveyed persist-
ently follow the edges of the basalt, and have the appearance of underlying
it; also that some leads, fed on the one side by the Ballarat ranges, and on
the other by the Egerton and Gordon rang'es, most certainly occur under the
basalt-flows. He considers that a deep lead probably crosses Ben’s Creek,
in the narrow gap of 15 chains between the outcrops of Silurian rock (shown
on the map which accompanies his report), and that another may pass
under the narrow strip of basalt marked 45 on his plan.


In referring to the survey on which he is now engaged, Mr. Taylor <
remarks that it would he useless to attempt to furnish a full report upon
a district of which he at present knows so little ; he is, however, of
opinion, that the survey will throw a good deal of light upon the trend of
the deep auriferous leads beneath the basalts at Clunes. He considers that
they are continuations of the leads existing at Creswick, although the general
opinion is that they are of local origin. A short description is given of the
leads wrought by the Hew Lothair and Theodora companies, and of the
auriferous deposits in what is locally known as the “ Paddock,” and which
he supposes to he “ reef-washes ” (older drift), derived from the auriferous
reefs at Clunes, so long and successfully worked, and to the courses of
which they are in close contiguity.
The Clunes reefs are stated to be of saddle formation, and they apparently
occur along the cap of a ridge forming an anticlinal axis. In the Hew
Lothair mine, of which a section is given, native copper is found, and much
of the quartz is discolored by blue and green carbonates of that metal;
zinchlende, galena, copper pyrites, and cubic and arsenical pyrites are also
found sparingly. Ho dykes have so far been discovered in the reefs.
Mr. Krause is now engaged in the geological survey of a block of country
embracing the Daylesford goldfield, and he has furnished notes on the
progress of the work, upon which the following remarks are based. The
sheet will comprise a total area of 100 square miles. Parts of the country
are rugged and very intricate, both in their geological and topographical
features. The rock formations consist chiefly of Lower Silurian, Hewer
Volcanic, Upper Tertiary, and Post Pliocene drifts. The survey of fifteen
square miles of country has been completed. Between the Loddon Eiver and
Daylesford the Silurian rocks are said to have a persistent westerly dip, hut
from the latter place westward the beds are considerably folded and fractured,
and are associated with the principal veins of quartz. The flags in these beds
consist of light, dark-grey, and almost black shales, and abound in graptolites.
The auriferous quartz veins that have been mostly wrought hitherto are
situated in a belt of country less than a mile in width, lying immediately
west of Wombat Hill. They have been traced almost uninterruptedly for
several miles north and south. Among the principal are Specimen Hill,
Colliers, Sandstone, Wombat Hill, Crown, Huggety, Ajax, St. George,
Eugenie, Hepburn, and Mauritius reefs.
Some of the reefs present peculiar features, and notably the Wombat Hill
Reef, from 8 to 30 feet in thickness, which is in some places a massive body
of quartz, yielding as high as an ounce of gold to the ton, and in others an
irregular mass of slate and quartz veins (called a mullock lode). At the
620-foot level in the Cornish mine, on the same reef, the mullock lode
terminates abruptly against the basset edges of the slate, although the walls
are known to continue downwards. This occurrence is illustrated by a
sketch-section. Mr. Krause also describes other irregularities in the forma-
tion of the lode, and their apparent effect upon the yield of gold.
Climes.
Daylesfovd.


Whatever may have been the influence at work to cause the increased
richness of the vein-stone in the instance last described, there can, I think,
be little doubt that the irregularities in the occurrence of the lodes, and the
existence of small side veins or spurs jutting out from the main lodes, are
due to a tendency of the bounding rocks to fracture unevenly when sub-
jected to disturbance ; where these rocks are fissile, they cleave regularly,
and the walls of the lodes are clean, and are usually conformable to the
lines of stratification.
Mr. Krause furnishes a sketch showing a bifurcation of the Wombat
Hill Reef, and a section showing a portion of the Mauritius Reef, both of
which contain numerous bands and veins of quartz, accompanied by frac-
tured dark-grey slate full of cubic pyrites.
It may be mentioned that the quartz reefs described are all approximate
to points of volcanic disturbance.
The physical aspect of the country is said to have been changed so much
by denudation since the deposition of the Lower Pliocene gravels that ther.e
is not sufficient proof to indicate whether these drifts ever occupied wide-
spread beds. Mr. Krause shows on a sketch a capping of the drift on the
summit of a hill at the Wallaby diggings.
A striking instance is given of the change of a drainage system by the
interposition of the lava-streams from Wombat Hill and neighboring points
of eruption, as exhibited in the Wombat Hill Lead, which lead has a north-
easterly course for a distance of about seven miles in a direction nearly at
right angles to the present valleys before it trends to the northward along
the course of the Loddon River.
Mr. Krause furnishes some interesting sketches of portions of the Dayles-
ford leads, and also one showing the edges of a crater as disclosed by
mining shafts sunk in search of auriferous gutters. In speaking of the
Dead Man’s Lead, near Wombat Hill, he expresses an opinion that it forms
a portion of the Italian Hill Lead, and says, if this opinion is correct, there
remains about 3,000 yards in length of auriferous gutter yet unworked. The
continuations of the Fern Hill Lead and the Wombat Hill Lead are also
problems that have yet to be solved by the miners.
As an instance of the richness of the Wombat Hill Lead and its feeders at
their upper portions, it is mentioned that on the first mile of this lead, from
the Haphazard to the White Star mines, 170,000 oz. of gold were ob-
tained, equal to a yield of 32 oz. of gold per lineal foot of its course.
The gutter drift of the lead contains more or less rounded quartz gravel
and sandstone shingle, and is remarkable as containing fragments of wood
and trunks of trees in various degrees of preservation, but nearly always
impregnated with, and in some instances replaced by bisulphuret of iron.
The overlying rock varies from a soft ash and tuff to sconce and dense
basalt, and near the junction of the Concordia and Wombat Hill leads a
layer of black clay and sandy mudstone is found full of impressions of reeds
and of leaves of eucalypti.


Tar up among the dividing ranges of Gippsland, at elevations superior to
those of any rocks of similar character in Victoria, are to he found some-
what extensive basaltic plateaux, known as the Bogong and Dargo High
Plains. Much speculation has been indulged in respecting these areas,
owing to their great elevation, their climatic peculiarities, and from the
fact that they were known to contain auriferous drifts. It was therefore
determined to prospect the country, and in the month of February last a
party was organized for the purpose by Mr. A. W. Howitt, and was
placed under the direction of Mr. Murray, who was instructed to make
a rough survey of the geological features of the tract to be examined,
and when necessary to employ the services of the party in opening any
exposures of sub-basaltic gravels that might present favorable indications
of gold.
Mr. Murray has now sent in a very exhaustive and interesting account of
his labors and observations in this region, together with a sketch-plan of
the area provisionally surveyed. (See plan with his report.) The plan
shows country 28 miles north and south by 17 miles east and west, equal to
476 square miles, and includes Mount Hotham, 6,100 feet, the highest point
in Victoria on the Main Divide. (This mountain is exceeded in height by
only a few others in the same tract of country, situated on spurs from the
principal range, such as Mount Bogong, the highest in Victoria, 6,508 feet;
Mount Feathertop, 6,303, &c.)
In describing the physical geography of the region Mr. Murray says that
a watershed line running north-easterly from Mount Cope, dividing the
Kiewa from the Cobungra and Bundarah rivers, crosses the Bogong High
Plains (on the northern side of the Main Divide). On the south side of the
Divide, and crossed by the watershed line between the Dargo River and the
heads of the Crooked River, are the plateaux known as the Dargo High
Plains.
These highlands are from 4,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea-level: they
consist of open undulating plains and moors, stony but well grassed, and are
interspersed with clumps and belts of “snow” gums. Separated from the
larger plains by low saddles, are several smaller ones, from 2,000 to 3,000
feet in height, but which evidently once formed a portion of the former.
Below the plains are the valleys of the Dargo and Cobungra rivers, bounded
by hills whose steep sides, clothed with timber and scrub, rise abruptly
to the plateaux above.
Mr. Murray thus descants upon the features of the country as disclosed to
the observer : —“ The sharp peaks of Mount Feathertop, the smoother outlines
of Mount Hotham and the Bogong Ranges, the rugged granite points of
Mount Fainter, and the distant view of the serrated peaks of the Buffalo
Mountains, all add grandeur to the beauty of the wide prospects visible in
this region, while the verdure, the perpetual springs and clear running
streams, give the country an aspect in welcome contrast in summer to the
parched appearance of the low country.”


As a summer pasture for stock the land would seem to be valuable ; but
it is subject to severe frosts even during the warm season, and for four
months of the winter the snow is said to render it impassable.
Lower Silurian slates and sandstones and metamorphic schists form the
bed-rocks of the whole of the area mapped. In parts these rocks are over-
laid by gravels, sands, and clays of Miocene or Middle Tertiary age,
and these again are capped by flows of lava of varying thickness, which
form the high plains of the district. The Palaeozoic rocks are to be seen on
the highest peaks, and also in the low-lying rivers and creeks which have
cut through and separated the plateaux above. In these modern water-
courses occur drifts of Tertiary age, resulting from the denudation of the
Silurian rocks, the Tertiary beds, and basalts.
It is pointed out that in Middle Tertiary times the beds of the water-
courses were at a far higher elevation than those of the present day ; that
flows of lava took place which filled in the valleys, and that the present
rivers then commenced to cut their way, and have since eroded the valleys
as they now exist, sometimes parallel with, and sometimes across the anciept
river-beds.
Mr. Murray remarks that the unaltered Silurian and metamorphic
rocks of the district have no arbitrary line of demarcation, but that as the
metamorphic region is approached a regular and gradual transition is
observable. The unaltered shales pass into silky micaceous shales, fol-
lowed by mica schists passing into gneiss and granitoid schists, which in
turn pass into granite, that sometimes retains a faintly traceable schistose
character.
Middle Tertiary deposits occur under the areas occupied by basalts, where
they seem to lie in well-defined troughs in the bed-rock ; but the sites of
landslips, and a few places where the gravels have been worked for gold, are
the only spots at which the deposits can be observed.
As a result of his observations, Mr. Murray considers that the main river
valleys of the Middle Tertiary period were broad and shallow, and distinct
from the character of the narrow and steep valleys along the courses of the
present mountain streams, and that the lava-flows were confined to the limits
of the ancient valleys, except perhaps in some few instances where the
dividing ridges were low. He speaks of the more rapid denudation of the
softer slates and shales of the dividing ridges as compared with the denuda-
tion of the basalts; the former have worn down in many places to lower
levels than the latter; he points out that, as the small isolated basaltic
patches which now cap hills separated from larger plateaux were once evi-
dently continuous, and formed a portion of the latter, and as these hills at
the present time are of little less elevation than the highest peaks of Mounts
Feathertop, Hotham, Cope, and others, it is evident that the ranges defining
the ancient watershed lines, of which the mountains named are probably
remnants, were once hundreds, or perhaps thousands of feet greater in eleva-
tion than they are now.


There are no exposures of gravel around the edges of the Bogong High
Plain, hut on the western margin of the basalt, in a head of the Bundarah
Creek, are exposed beds of yellowish-brown laminar clay, containing fossil
leaves, among which are Tceniopteris tenuissime striata (McCoy)—said to
he the first specimen of this fossil found in Tertiary rocks in Australia —
Lastrea Dargoensis (McCoy), allied to a Miocene species of the Arctic
regions, &c.
A small outlier of basalt was discovered capping a hill on the Divide between
the Diamantina branch of the Kiewa and the heads of the Cobungra, about
two miles N.E. from Mount Hotham, at an elevation of 6,175 feet above the
sea-level, and about 74 feet higher than the summit of that mountain; a few
more patches of the same rock were found S.S.E. at lower elevations, but
were supposed to be portions of a once continuous flow.
Basalt occurs on the east side of Mount Hotham, on the summits of
conspicuous hills, known as the Higinbotham Heights, near Mount
Hotham, and also for a considerable distance along the Main Divide, at
about three miles from that mountain, and at great elevation in some other
places.
On a spur north of the Main Dividing Eange, between two tributaries of the
Cobungra, known as Murphy’s and Brandy creeks, is an exposure of gravel
from beneath the basalt, now being worked for gold, and known as White’s
claim. On the slope N.N.W. from Boiler Plain, south of the Main Divide,
is another exposure, known as Morris’s claim ; and near the southern end of
the basalt of Mount Tabletop, on the fall westerly into the Dargo, also south
of the main range, is another, known as Armour’s claim. The bed-rock at
White’s claim is about 4,800 feet ; that at Morris’s, the other side of the
Main Divide, 4,640 feet; and the summit of the Divide between the two
claims is from 5,350 to 5,500 feet above sea-level.
The workings at White’s claim prove that the channel trends southerly,
towards the Main Divide, in a direction exactly opposite to the modern
water-courses; and detached patches of basalt, and their varying levels,
also indicate the position and direction of the ancient valley beds, and the
great alteration in the physical features of the region. From these, and
other indications fully explained in his report, Mr. Murray points out the
probable positions of the leads, and says that he has no hesitation in ex-
pressing an opinion that the drift deposits at Morris’s claim are continuous
beneath the basalts on the present Main Divide with those exposed in the
land-slips at the head of Brandy Creek, and probably also with those at
White’s claim, thus showing that the position of the ancient dividing range
was different from that of the one at present existing, and that the southern
slopes of that range extended far back into the present watershed area of
the Eiver Murray. As regards the exposure of drift at Armour’s claim, it is
considered that the gravel is likely to be a vestige of a bend in the main
lead from Boiler Plain, and its elevation, which is 400 feet less than the
drift at Morse’s claim, supports the conjecture.


The next continuation of the Middle Tertiary deposits, and their overlying
lava beds, occurs at the Dargo High Plains, a gap of three miles across
having been caused by the erosion of the Cargo valley. Along the edges
of the basalt in this locality deposits of gravel have been worked for gold,
and at a claim known as Synnot’s, near the Mayford Spur, a great thickness
of gravel is revealed, with some bands of foliated clay, in which were found
Cinnamomum polymorphoides, identified with fossil flora of Miocene age ;
and near the same place were found siliceous and ferruginous conglomerates,
containing fossil leaves, supposed to represent imperfect lauraceous leaves of
undescribed species, also occurring in Miocene Tertiary beds at Bacchus Marsh,
together with a specimen of Salisburia Murrayi (McCoy), nearly allied to
some Miocene forms from the Arctic Regions, but not hitherto found in
Australian strata.
Mr. Murray’s general conclusions are, that the ancient Cargo of the
Miocene epoch headed from the opposite side of the Main Dividing Range
near Mount Fainter; that the deposits at White’s claim, Boiler Plaih, Mount
Tabletop, and Mayford Spur, are remnants of its bed, or of some of its
branches, and that the intervening parts, and the heads of its tributaries,
have been entirely removed during the erosion of the present rivers, and fur-
ther, that a large main affluent came in from a direction across what are now
the courses of the Twentyfive-mile and Thirty-mile creeks. He says that
fluviatile and atmospheric action seem to have been the only agencies that
have sculptured the country to its present form subsequent to the lava-flows.
The basalts are referred to as Older Volcanic (Miocene period) ; they are
highly magnetic, and their general structure is columnar. Fine specimens
of pentagonal columns occur at Mount Hotham and other parts ; portions
of the surface of the Bogong High Plain have the appearance of being paved
with five-sided blocks of stone, and on some of the mountain sides, where
land-slips have occurred, acres are covered with five-sided blocks of basalt.
Ho apparent vents or pipes from which the lava-flows have issued have
been yet discovered : it is likely that more than one exists, as the thickness
of the basalt is, in some places, equal to 700 feet, and Mr. Murray points
out that it is hardly reasonable to Suppose that it was poured forth in a
single stream.
j At White’s claim (Bogong Plain), Morris’s claim (Boiler Plain),
Armour’s claim (Mount Tabletop), Synnot’s claim (Mayford Spur), also
at German Terrace, and on the slopes into the Little Dargo and Pyke’s
Creek, either coarse or fine gold has been obtained in the gravels coming
from beneath the basalts, and many of the creeks and gullies below have
yielded good returns where they have cut through the old Miocene gravels.
This leads Mr. Murray to the opinion, that the gravels beneath the basalts
are auriferous throughout, but that from their great thickness and the general
dissemination of the gold they could only be profitably worked by means of
an ample water supply for ground sluicing. Where the gravels are
under the basalts they would require to be brought to the sluices by means


of adits. Water could be obtained throughout the year at the required levels
from springs and the heads of permanent streams, but the construction of
long races or channels would be required for its conveyance.
Excluding the Bogong Plain, because little is yet known as to the cha-
racter of the deposits beneath the basalts in that portion of the country,
Mr. Murray estimates that there is a length of about twelve miles of main
lead and its principal tributary at the following places :—Cobungra Plateau,
Boiler Plain, S.W. side of Tabletop, Mayford Spur, between Pyke’s Creek
and Little Cargo, and the western branch from the direction of the Thirty-
mile Creek. It is considered that fairly remunerative, and in places rich
yields of gold would be obtained, but that, owing to the scarcity of quartz
reefs in the adjacent country, they would not be equal to the leads of the
Western goldfields, which are situated in country traversed by great belts
of auriferous quartz reefs.
I believe Mr. Murray’s general reasoning to be sound on this point. I am,
however, disposed to the opinion, as the result of observations in other parts
of Victoria where auriferous quartz reefs are not abundant, that gold in the
gravels underlying the basalts would be found to be of a “ patchy” cha-
racter; that is, rich and “ coarse” in those parts near to the sites of auriferous
reefs that have been extensively denuded and broken up, and poor and
“fine” in others.
Mr. Murray recommends, as favorable sites for the operations of a pro-
specting party, the outcrops of gravels on the falls from the Main Divide into
Cobungra and Cargo rivers, and also similar outcrops on the western side of
the Cargo. He mentions that operations should be commenced in November,
so as to command six months of favorable weather, and also makes sugges-
tions as to the mode in which the work should be carried out.
Mr. A. W. Howitt, F.G.S., has furnished, as usual, a very valuable con- ]
tribution to the annual Eeport, in a series of carefully prepared notes, in
continuation of a paper on the Devonian rocks of North Gippsland, which
appeared in No. 111. “ Progress Report.”
As a preliminary remark, he calls attention to a foot-note in his previous
paper on the Buchan limestones —appended to page 199, Progress Report
No. lll.—in which he alluded to the marked conglomeratic character of
the Snowy River porphyries, &c., as it seems by this clue he was led to
continued investigations of these rocks, the results of which are now given
as a further contribution to our knowledge of the Upper Palaeozoic
formations of Gippsland.
Mr. Howitt’s previous investigations had induced a belief in his mind that
the marine limestones of the Buchan rested upon the Snowy River por-
phyries, but further examination has caused him to think differently, and
he is now of opinion that the purely marine limestones of Buchan form but
a moiety of the Middle Devonian formations, with which they are naturally
grouped.
D


Two sketch-sections of country at Butcher’s Creek, one from Murendel
Eiver to Butcher’s Creek, and one at Murendel River, with descriptions of
the rocks and their modes of occurrence, are furnished, and it is inferred
that the rocks forming the several sections are portions of one series, and
that they show a sequence downward from limestones of purely marine
origin through calcareous and felsitic tufas, sandstones, breccias, and con-
glomerates, to what is properly a volcanic series of littoral origin. The total
thickness of the group is estimated at about 1,270 feet, of which 270 feet
are limestones, and 1,000 feet are tufas, breccias, &c.
Faults in the felsites at Butcher’s Creek and the Murendel River, one of
which appears to approximate in direction to the course of the latter stream, are
illustrated and described. A description is also given of the rocks occurring
at the Buchan River, as disclosed in two cross sections illustrated by Mr.
Howitt. The marked unconformity of the rocks in these two sections is con-
sidered to indicate that a fault exists between the Buchan limestone and the
older felsite.
Sketch-sections and descriptions of the rocks at Gellingall then follow,
which exhibit the same features as in the sections at the Murendel and Buchan
rivers; from this resemblance Mr. Howitt says we may not unfairly consider
that at Gellingall a view is obtained of the whole group as it remains, frOm
the underlying granite on which its base rests to the limestones of partly
marine origin with which the series terminates, and which, up to the present
time, have been here the representatives of Middle Devonian formations.
A provisional estimate is given of the character and thickness of the De-
vonian formations of North Gippsland, commencing with the Iguana Creek
(Upper Devonian), which consist of sedimentary formations, containing
plant remains, and passing through the felsites and basalts of the Snowy
Bluff beds, the tufas and breccias, &c., of the Lower Buchan beds, down to
the felsites, &c., of the Snowy Eiver porphyries (Lower Devonian ?).
Mr. Howitt remarks that the gradual spread of marine conditions over
the Buchan and Gellingall areas would suggest previous terrestrial conditions
probably to the north and north-west; the Iguana beds show the existence
of these conditions unmistakably by the numerous fossil plants alone found
in them, and we may conclude that the Devonian age was in North Gipps-
land a period characterised by the occurrence of vast volcanic manifesta-
tions, which w'ere most probably terrestrial.
An interesting description is furnished of the mode of occurrence and
origin of the lead-ore and other deposits in the Buchan beds, and of their
association with the enclosing rocks. Sketch-sections, taken at Back Creek
and at the Murendel River, together with descriptions, are furnished, as
affording details of the rock formations at the lead mines opened at those
places.
At the Back Creek mine the ore is not found in a true lode, but in irregu-
lar bunches and strings in the bedding planes of the limestone, and also
disseminated in grains in the calcareous and adjoining felsitic rocks.


The total quantity of ore raised from this mine is estimated at from 180
to 200 tons. About 76 tons were of good quality, and the remainder poor.
Fifty tons smelted at the antimony works in Collingwood yielded about 38
per cent, of metal. The mine is now completely abandoned.
At the Murendel mine the ore, as at Back Creek, follows the bedding
planes of the limestones, and penetrates crevices in them, or is disseminated
in crystalline grains and spangles throughout the mass of rock ; but Mr.
Howitt states, from personal examination, that the ore-vein worked in the
mine is connected with a fault, and that it has all the appearance of a true
lode, the gangue being a limestone breccia, cemented by carbonate of lime
and metallic sulphides.
The value of the lode could only be determined by systematic examination
and exploration. Up to the present time this has not been done; most of
the capital and energy of the company has been expended in erecting
smelting and other works, while the actual development of the mine has
been neglected. The company has ceased to work, but up to the time of their
discontinuing operations 74 tons of ore had been smelted on the ground, which
yielded 482 pigs of lead of 112 lbs. each, equal to about 33 per cent, of metal.
, In Appendices, Mr. Howitt furnishes remarks based on microscopic exami-
nations of sixteen samples of rocks collected by Mr. Reginald A. F. Murray
at the Avon River, Mount Hump and Ben Cruachan creeks, Mount Wel-
lington, &c ; and also notes on the examination of seventeen rock samples,
collected at Hughes’s Creek, Gap Creek, Gellingall, Buchan, the Murendel
River, &0., and intended to illustrate the character of the Buchan beds.
Evidence of much care is apparent in the preparation of these notes, and
they are of scientific interest.
In May last Mr. Krause furnished a careful and interesting report, with:
plan and sections, of the mine of the South Extended Sultan Company
at Blackwood, containing many suggestions of a practical nature. His
report is reproduced herewith for general information.
Mr. Wm. Nicholas has furnished an interesting paper, containing remarks
on the geology and mineral resources of the goldfield in and about Rush-
worth and Whroo, in which he calls attention to an outcrop of granite not
previously noted, lying between Sandy Creek and the Goulburn River, south
of Coy’s Diggings. The exposure is small in area, and is apparently caused
by the denudation of overlying Upper Silurian rocks. Mount Black and the
Sugar-loaf Hill, two eminences on either side of the valley in which the
granite occurs, and also other hills in the vicinity, rest upon granite, and are
capped by Upper Silurian rocks.
In referring to the Upper Silurian strata, which extend over nearly the
whole area under observation, Mr. Nicholas points out that, unlike other
portions of Victoria, there is a great want of uniformity in the bearing of
their strike, inasmuch as, within short distances, it varies from directions
nearly north and south to east and west; and further that the strata generally
have been much disturbed, and tilted nearly to the perpendicular.


The creeks running to the northward in this district are either absorbed
in the sandy soils of the Murray plain, or in swamp depressions. They
display the same characteristics in this respect as several in other parts of
Victoria within the Murray basin, and there can, I think, be little doubt
that a large proportion of the rainfall which drains from this basin finds
its way to the sea by percolation through gravel drifts, forming older
drainage beds that lie beneath the surface and at a much lower level than
the modern streams.
i Mr. Nicholas furnishes an account of the alluvial gold workings at and
near Rushworth, Whroo, and Coy’s Diggings. All these are shallow in
depth. Deposits of cemented gravel, more or less auriferous, cover large
portions of the country about Rushworth, Whroo, Nine-mile, and Fon-
tainbleau. Very few nuggets of gold exceeding five ounces weight are known
to have been found in the goldfield. It is considered that the country lying
between Good Friday Creek and Redcastle, and that between the ranges
north-east of Coy’s Diggings, in a south-easterly direction towards the
Goulburn, present good fields for prospecting operations.
Near Rushworth most of the quartz reefs have an east and west strike,
conformable in direction to the strike of the Silurian rocks in which they
occur ; but while the underlie of the latter is nearly vertical, the reefs dip
at a high angle to the north and across the lines of stratification. The
lodes are often much faulted, and they vary in thickness from 6 inches to
6 feet. Many of them have proved very rich in gold, but very few have
as yet been tested below the water-level. At Coy’s Diggings the strike of
the quartz reefs conforms generally to the direction of the meridian.
Some interesting information is given from notes furnished by Mr. T.
Benbow, who was formerly in charge of a local branch bank, as to the
quality of the gold obtained from reefs in the district under review, showing
the purity of the metal in many instances to have been remarkable.
Mr. Nicholas furnishes tabulated particulars relating to the strike, dip,
and thickness of many of the reefs, and extracts are furnished from reports by
Messrs. Ulrich and Lewis respectively on the Balaclava mine. This mine
is shown to contain several veins of quartz, yielding gold of vatying quali-
ties. A description, with diagram, is also given of the workings on an
antimony and gold-bearing lode known as the Albert Reef, together with
general descriptions of other mines in the district.
Professor McCoy has furnished another of his admirable decades (No. V.)
of the Prodromus of the Palaeontology of Victoria, containing numerous
figures and descriptions of fossils of Tertiary and Upper and Lower Silurian
formations, an outline of which is given in the following remarks.
The first and second plates contain illustrations of the skull and teeth
of a new extinct species of Eared Seal, Arctocephalus Williamsi, obtained
from Tertiary calcareous beds at Queenscliff. This seal is described as
nearly related to the Otaria and Arctocephalus of our South Seas, and most
nearly approaching the Australian Eared Seal, the Arctocephalus lohatus.


The third plate contains excellent drawings of Waldheimia Corioensis
(McCoy) and Waldheimia macropora, mollusca illustrating characteristic
Brachiopoda of the Tertiary age. The former is described as the largest of
our Tertiary Brachiopoda, and unlike any living forms at present known.
It is abundant in the Tertiary sands of Corio Bay, at the Bird Rock, and in
similar beds at Jan Juc. The latter is, with the exception of the coarser
punctation of its surface, in all respects similar to the living W. Jlavescens
of Hobson’s Bay. It is very common in the older Pliocene Tertiary strata
of Flemington, and less common in Oligocene beds between Mount Eliza
and Mount Martha.
The fourth plate illustrates two Tertiary species of Cardium, C. pseudo-
magnum (McCoy) and C. {Protocardium) anti-semigranulatum. The first is
said to be very abundant in the Miocene Tertiary sandy beds at Bird Rock
Bluff, near Geelong. The second, which is closely related to Cardium
{Protocardium) semigranulatum (Sowerby) of the Upper Eocene or
Oligocene strata of the Hampshire coasts. The fossil is described as rare
in Lower Miocene Tertiary of Moorabool.
The fifth plate furnishes further illustrations of the Spondylus gcedero-
poides (McCoy), and also an additional Victorian smaller and rarer extinct
species Spondylus pseudo-radula (McCoy). The former is the representa-
tive of the European Tertiary and recent Spondylus gmderopus. As regards
the latter, Professor McCoy says there are no recent species very nearly
allied to it, and of fossil species the nearest is S. rarispina and S. radula
of the Older French Tertiaries. The species is remarkable in the thinness
of the valves. In most localities it is only about fi inches in length. It
occurs in the Oligocene Tertiary clays and limestones near Mount Martha,
in the clay beds of Muddy Creek, in the sandy Tertiaries of Fyansford, in
the sands and limestones of Miocene Tertiary age at Bairnsdale, and in the
Older Pliocene sandy clays of Mordialloc.
The sixth and seventh plates contain figures of species of the more
abundant forms characteristic of the Upper Silurian Mollusca not illustrated
in previous decades, and intended by Professor McCoy to facilitate the recog-
nition of strata of the Upper Silurian age by the field geologists now
engaged in their examination. The sixth plate shows Leptcena {Leptagonial)
rhomboidalis, common in the Upper Silurian rocks in Wenlock shale at
Yering, Upper Yarra ; Trematospira liopleura (McCoy) and Trematospira
formosa, more or less common in “ May Hill” sandstone, at the hills near
Mount Disappointment; Spirifera plicatella (Lin.), var. Macropleura
(Conrad), identical with the S. macropleura of the “ Lower Helder-
herg” rocks of New York, and common in Wenlock shale, near Kil-
m°re; and Spirifera sulcata (His.), common in the Wenlock shale of
Yering.
Professor ‘ McCoy says that the much greater size of the Australian
specimens of this fossil than those found in Europe is the only difference
he can perceive between them.


The seventh plate illustrates Spirigerina reticularis (Lin. sp.), common
in the Silurian and Devonian formations of Australia and Europe ; Rhyn-
chonella ( hemithyris ) decemplicata (Sow.), common in the May Hill sand-
stone, near porphyry dyke, west of Mount Disappointment, and in similar
sandstone in England, which is known as the true base of the Upper Silurian
system; Nucleospira Australis (McCoy),almost identical with the Wenlock
shale Atrypa compressor of Wales, and with the Nucleospira ventricosa
of the Lower Helderberg beds of Hew York; also common in the May
Hill sandstone of hills west of Mount Disappointment ; Pentamerus
Australis (McCoy). The Professor says this may be regarded as an Aus-
tralian representative of P. ohlongus of exactly the same geological horizon
at the base of the Upper Silurian, which it strongly resembles in size,
shape, and surface. Abundant in May Hill sandstone, section 12, parish
of Yering.
The eighth plate shows a new spheroidal Tertiary species of sponge,
Tetkya Newberyi (McCoy), the line hair-like or asbestiform hollow silicious
spicules of which exactly accord with those of sponges of the recent Euro-
pean genus, Tethya. It occurs in the cream-colored Miocene Tertiary strata
of Boggy Creek, near Sale.
The same plate also contains an illustration of Graphularia Robince
(McCoy), described as a remarkable extinct gigantic species of sea-pen,
allied to Graphularia of the European London clay formation, and also
closely allied to the sea-pen now living in Hobson’s Bay ( Sarcoptilon ), but
four times the size of the living types. The fossil exists in the Miocene
Tertiary strata at Waurn Ponds and at Bird Rock Bluff.
The ninth plate contains illustrations of Cyprcea (Luponia ) leptorhyncha
(McCoy), slightly allied to C. Haveri, found in the Oligocene Tertiary clays
of Mount Eliza and Mount Martha, Mornington ; Cyprcea ( Aricia) conso-
brina (McCoy), related to C. eximia and C. platypyga , said to be very rare
in the lower Miocene or Oligocene Tertiary strata of Moorabool River; and
Cyprcea ( Luponia ) contusa (McCoy). Professor McCoy remarks that this
common little species is curiously distinguished by its surface seeming to be
covered with little bruises or indentations of irregular size and shape,
resembling a minutely shrivelled fruit. It is not nearly allied to any living
or extinct form with which he is acquainted. It occurs in the Oligocene
Tertiary clays and limestones of Mount Eliza and Mount Martha.
The tenth plate has further illustrations of the Graptolites of our goldfield
slates, including Graptolites (Didymograpsus ) Thureaui, named after the dis-
coverer, Mr. Thureau, of Sandhurst, and Graptolites ( 'Didymograpsus ) Headi
(Hall). The first is said to be rare in the black and red slates of Llandeilo
flag age of the Sandhurst goldfield, and the second in flags of the same
age, section 16, parish of Darriwil, Sutherland Creek, together with
D. Logani, 1). pristis, and I), bryonoides, as in Canada.
The fossils briefly referred to in the following description have been
received by the Department during the year, and reported upon.


Mr. J. Y. Bartlett, of Colac, while prospecting in the vicinity of the
Love’s Eiver, near to its junction with the Gellibrand, found some fossils and
other specimens, which were sent to the Department for examination. The
fossils proved to be a new species of Echinolampas of the Miocene Tertiary
age.
Some fossils obtained by Mr. William Nicholas from a range of hills
about midway between Whroo and Coy’s Diggings were stated by Professor
McCoy to he articular surfaces of crinoid stems of the Actinocrinus type,
and fragments of the Upper Silurian variety of the Orthis calligramma.
At Coleraine a shaft was sunk in search of coal, and rock was pierced
containing fossils. Some of the specimens collected and sent to the
Department by Mr. Paramor were examined by Professor McCoy, and were
described by him as belonging to various parts of the Tceniopteris Daintreei
(McCoy), with the exception of a new species of Zingophyllites. The former
are common in the Cape Patterson coal-seams. The fossils “indicate
closely the Mesozoic age of rocks.”
Mr. J. A. Panton, P.M., forwarded a collection of fossils gathered at Shel-
ford, and near Petteval, Waurn Ponds. Those obtained at the former place
contained Fusus centrifugus (McCoy), and a new species of Mur ex, both of
which occur in the Mount Martha beds, and indicate strata of Upper
Oligocene age. The remaining specimens consisted of Cetotolites, or ear
bones and other portions of extinct whales of three species ; teeth of the
European Miocene Tertiary shark, Oxyrhina Desori (Ag.) ; Turitella, a new
species, also found in the Mount Martha beds ; Terehratula- Corioensis
(McCoy) ; Cellepora, one new species ; Cidaris, spines of three undescribed
species ; and Graphularia Robince (McCoy), axes of the gigantic extinct
sea-pen.
Several specimens of the fossil flora, found in clays beneath the basalts of
the Dargo and Bogong High Plains, were forwarded by Mr. Reginald A. F.
Murray. They contained a new species of Tceniopteris — T. tenuissime
striata (McCoy) ; Lastrea — L. Dargoensis (McCoy) ; and a few fragments of
dicotyledonous leaves, and also imperfect lauraceous leaves, and an interesting
specimen of a species of Salisburia, S. Murrayi (McCoy).
Mr. Murray subsequently forwarded sixteen plant impressions from
Freestone Creek; one contained an obscure impression of Cordaites Australis;
the others were too fragmentary and imperfect to render them determinable.
Further remarks on these fossils will be found in connection with Mr.
Murray’s report herewith.
Baron F. von Mueller has again kindly added to the list of new vegetable:
fossils of the auriferous drifts published by the Department by a revised
description of a fossil fruit, Wilkinsonia bilaminata, from the Black Lead,
Gulgong, New South Wales, 140 to 175 feet in depth, and obtained through
the efforts of the Government Geologist, Mr. C. J. Wilkinson, F.G.S.
It is remarked that the fossil may perhaps have belonged to the order
Sapindacece. It has not yet been discovered in Victoria, but as it proves to
Fossil fruits.


be coeval to the series already described and found within the colony, a full
description and illustration of the specimen has been published with the
Mining Surveyors and Registrars’ Reports for the quarter ending 30th
September 1877.
Among the presentations to the Department, I desire to refer to an ex-
cellently executed map of a geological section of the shaft of the City of
Ballarat Company, prepared by the manager, Mr. T. W. Thompson. This
shaft was pierced to a great depth through several distinct flows of basalt ;
the Silurian rock was struck at 409 feet from the surface, hut before reaching
this depth a very strong flow of water, estimated at 3,000 gallons per
minute, was encountered, issuing from a “honeycombed” (vesicular) layer
of volcanic rock, which rendered the prosecution of the latter portion of the
work very costly and tedious.
Noteworthy among the mineral specimens presented to the Department
may be mentioned a collection of very fine felspar crystals forwarded by
Mr. Harris, legal manager of the Rocky Mountain Tunnelling and Sluicing
Company, Beechworth. They were found in quantity in hard granite, at a
distance of 720 feet from the mouth of a tunnel, now being cut as a tail
race, under a portion of the town of Beechworth, and they occurred in a
small patch about 6 feet in length horizontally, and about 9 inches in
depth.
Mention may be also made of a sample of granite containing gold,
obtained by Mr. Henry Davidson, Mining Surveyor, from a prospecting
claim at Sandy Creek, in the county of Benambra. The analyst of the
Department describes this rock as a true granitic quartz, surrounded
by felspar. Several pounds weight of the mineral were crushed, mixed,
and assayed, and reported to contain gold equal to 19 dwt. 14 grs. per ton
(report 4835).
Mr. Cosmo Newbery, B.Sc., the analyst to the Department, has furnished
another of his interesting reports relating to or connected with the work
upon which he has been engaged during the past year.
As a matter of interest to agriculturists, Mr. Newbery alludes to the
almost constant presence of phosphates of lime, alumina, and iron in the
brown iron-ores of South Grippsland. From some specimens of these rocks
and their accompanying soils, obtained at Brandy Creek, he found phos-
phates in notable quantity, and the rock—a yellow-grey soft earthy sand-
stone—further contained soluble silicates and salts of potash, soda, and
ammonia. Mr. Newbery considers that the yellow and grey soils derived
from these rocks, which have been hitherto despised by agriculturists,
are likely to be of considerable value for cultivation, and he states that,
in some instances where they have been tried, they have given excellent
results.
Numerous specimens of lignite, from country near the Gippsland Railway,
have been examined, and it is considered they are likely to be of commercial
value as furnace fuel. One sample received from the Honorable John


Woods readily produced gas of a high illuminating power ; others, however,
were not so good in this respect.
Several samples of guano, from the recently opened Skipton caves, have <
been analysed by Mr. Newbery, and found to contain phosphates of some
rarity.
Allusion is made to the continued examinations of sandstones, with the i
view of determining their adaptability for building purposes, and favorable
mention is made of a sample obtained from Walker’s quarry at Stawell, and
of other samples from Briagolong and Mansfield.
Interesting accounts are given of microscopic and other examinations by
Mr. G. H. F. Ulrich, F.G.S., of basaltic rocks forwarded from Learmonth
by Mr. Norman Taylor.
The finding of gold in true granite at Sandy Creek (Benambra) is men-
tioned as the most notable discovery of the year. Eeferring to the auriferous
and cupriferous ores of Bethanga in the same part of the colony, the dis-
covery of which was noted in the last Progress Eeport, Mr. Newbery points
out, for the information of miners, that the copper and magnetic pyrites
they contain are almost free from gold, and that the metal is found in the
iron and arsenical pyrites. He considers it would be advisable, before
reducing these ores, to separate them by mechanical dressing whenever the
mixture of copper pyrites with the auriferous arsenical and iron pyrites is
not too intimate. He is of opinion that the more preferable process by which
to treat the ores would be to prepare them for amalgamation, remove the
gold, and then, if desired, to smelt the waste for copper ; or perhaps a still
cheaper method would be found in an adaptation of Hunt and Douglass’,
Henderson’s, or Gipps’ processes, thereby taking the copper and silver out
as chlorides, and leaving the gold with the oxide of iron, so that it could
easily be obtained by amalgamation.
As showing the satisfactory result of the well-known process adopted by
the Port Phillip Company, Clunes, for the treatment of quartzose ores
associated with only iron and arsenical pyrites, Mr. Newbery refers to the
examination of some samples of pyrites sands from the works of this com-
pany, after they had been roasted in a reverberatory furnace, and amalga-
mated for the extraction of gold.
He also calls attention to a new process devised by Mr. H. Eosales, of
Walhalla, for the treatment of auriferous pyritous sands, by which they are
ground to a fine slime, and amalgamated without roasting. It is claimed
that the cost of grinding is less than that of roasting, and that there is no
increase in the loss of mercury.
Plutner’s chlorine process is said to have been adopted by Messrs. Chap-
man and Edwards with excellent results in the treatment of the ordinary
pyrites of Sandhurst.
In referring to a process devised some time ago for the treatment of
auriferous ores containing sulphide of antimony, by fusing the sulphide with
a portion of metallic antimony, and using the same metal with fresh charges
£


of the ore until it becomes rich in gold, and then separating the two metals
by the oxidation of the antimony, Mr. Hewbery says that this process,
although suitable to rich antimony ores, will not answer with those contain-
ing less than 30 per cent, of the sulphide of antimony, as they are too sili-
cious to fuse. He explains the difficulty hitherto experienced in success-
fully dealing with these poorer ores, and states that for some time past he
has been experimenting, with a view of finding a process by which the gold
and antimony in these ores might be saved, and has now devised a method
which seems to answer well. The ore from the mine, or the scoria from the
furnaces, is placed in a close furnace or kiln, with an amount of salt or other
chloride, and is brought up to a dull red heat; steam is then forced through
the charge, until the whole, or nearly the whole of the antimony, is got rid
of by conversion into chloride of antimony.
Mr. Hewbery explains in detail the effect of the above process, and says
that trial lots of 6,8, and 15 tons have been treated with perfect success.
Mention is also made of the revolving furnaces for roasting antimonial
quartz tailings, devised by Mr. H. Herrenschmidt and Mr. Borthwick re-
spectively, and erected at Costerfleld and South Costerfield, which are
intended to save the antimony, and to treat from 20 to 50 tons per diem.
Vast heaps of these sands or tailings, the accumulation of many years, are
lying at the Costerfield mines, and if the new methods of treatment be
attended with success, a very large amount of antimony is likely to be
produced during the current year.
The newly devised processes of treatment are likely to have a most im-
portant bearing upon the profitable realization of our poorer antimony ores.
At present it is said that some of our auriferous antimonial mines do not
yield half the gold contained in the ores, and when worked for gold do not
return any antimony.
Mr. Newbery is still continuing his experiments on the mode of the
deposition of gold, but the results are not yet ready for publication. He
says that he has as yet found no proof of the condition in which the gold-
carrier exists in the waters. The interesting nature of the problem is
referred to in connection with the association of gold with antimony and
copper.
The examinations of water conducted last year are still being continued.
An account is given of the analyses for ammonia and nitrogenous bodies of
twenty-seven samples of water obtained from wells at Kyneton, from the
Port Phillip mine at Clunes, from the Yan Yean and Geelong water supply
works, from Sandhurst, rain-water from tanks and from the Observatory
rain gauge, and also collected at the Laboratory, Melbourne. The greatest
amount of ammonia was found in samples of rain-water collected in Mel-
bourne immediately after a drought. In the mine-waters from Clunes silica
in solution was found to the extent of about 1 in 100,000.
Satisfactory progress has been made during the year with the underground
surveys of quartz mines on Garden Gully line of reef at Sandhurst. Mr.


Thomas has completed the surveys and plans of the following mines,
embracing a length of about 1 mile and 31 chains along the courses of the
lodes : —The Garden Gully United, South Garden Gully Tribute, Garden
Gully Freehold, Miller’s Tribute, Ladies’ Tribute, Sea, Horwood’s, Burrowes,
Golden Stream, Londonderry, Gordon’s Garden Gully Tribute, Londonderry
Tribute, Cosmopolitan, Ulster and South Ulster, and the Garden Gully
Railway.
Mr. Thomas has furnished copious notes referring to the characteristics
of the lodes, which are principally of value for comparison with his plans
and sections. I have not therefore considered it advisable to reproduce
them with this Report ; it is proposed to publish them in a separate
form.
Mr. Bate, an officer engaged from time to time as opportunities offer
(when not employed in his routine duties of District Mining Sur-
veyor) in the underground survey of the cross and flat reefs at Stawell,
reports that the workings of the following companies have now been
surveyed by him, viz., Prince Patrick, Prince Alfred, Magdala, Moon-
light, Pleasant Creek, Great Northern, Crown Cross United, No. 2
Crown Cross, Nos. 8 and 9 Crown Cross, and a portion of the Scotchmans
United.
The plans and sections of the above work are in a progressive state,
and the entire survey, it is expected, will be completed in about six
months.
The work of track-cutting through the densely timbered and scrubbed
portions of the Gippsland district has been continued under the direction
and supervision of Mr. 0. P. Whitelaw, Mining Surveyor. Practicable
means of access have been afforded to the miner to many portions of the
territory hitherto difficult to reach, and valuable lines of communication
have been opened.
During the past year a track, 42 miles in length, has been cut and cleared
between Mount Useful and the Moroka River ; and also one of 35 miles in
length between Howittville and Harrietville. The surveys and plans of the
routes, and the reports upon the geological features of the country, have not
yet been completed ; remarks upon these will therefore be reserved for the
next Progress Report.
In the last Report reference was made to the satisfactory yields of gold
obtained from the Stawell quartz mines—which are the deepest in Vic-
toria. As a matter of scientific interest it may be mentioned that at the
still greater depths from which quartz has been obtained at Stawell during
the past year the yields continue to show no falling-off. For instance,
it is reported that 2,599 tons of quartz, from 1,060 to 1,120 feet in
depth, averaged 2 oz. 6 dwt. of gold to the ton ; and 4,212 tons, obtained
at 800 and 951 feet from the surface, gave 1 oz. 8 dwt. 13 grs. per ton ;
and 1,924 tons, got at a depth of 850 feet, produced 2 oz. 3 dwt. 1 gr. per
ton.

In the Sandhurst and Ballarat districts the yields from the deeper mines
appear upon the whole to hear favorable comparison with those obtained at
lesser depths.
A vote of £IO,OOO having been passed by the Legislature for expenditure
during the year in prospecting for new goldfields, numerous parties were
organized to examine country in many parts of Victoria considered likely to
contain auriferous veins and deposits. As an inducement to unremitting
and diligent search, arrangements were made that the agreements with
the prospectors should cease and determine on the discovery of gold in
sufficient quantities to be remunerative, and that the prospectors should
then be at liberty to mark off and take possession of mining claims, and
work them on their own account, so as to be able to reap the benefit of their
discoveries.
The following is a brief outline of the results of the prospecting operations
undertaken in the several mining districts. Further details will be found
in the statement at end of this volume.
In the Ararat Mining District eight parties, consisting of thirty-five men,
were employed in prospecting country about Moyston, Armstrongs, Oath-
cart, Stawell, Great Western, Landsborough, and Raglan.
The Moyston party (five men) are reported to have sunk twenty-four shafts
to depths varying from 11 to 45 feet in depth, exclusive of others of lesser
depth, and to have done a large amount of driving, but no success attended
their efforts.
The Armstrong party (five men) sank upwards of thirty-eight shafts, of
the aggregate depth of 578 feet, and further explored by driving 267 feet
on the bottom rock, but no more than the “color” of gold is said to have
been obtained.
The Cathcart party (six men) sank forty-two shafts of various depths.
Gold in small quantities was obtained in a gully about one mile south
from the “Port Curtis” Lead, One load of dirt is said to have yielded
3i? dwt.
The Stawell party (five men) sank a number of shafts up to 76 feet in
depth. Small quantities of gold were obtained, but nothing of importance.
The Great Western party (four men) sank twelve shafts, from 5 to 82
feet in depth, and drove upwards of 80 feet. They discovered gold only in
small quantities.
The Landsborough party (five men) sank about thirty-five shafts, ranging
from 33 to 67 feet in depth, but only found traces of gold.
The Raglan party (five men) sank eighty shafts, from 5 to 55 feet in
depth, but with no encouraging results.
In the Ballarat Mining District, four parties, consisting of twenty-three
men, were employed, their centres of operation being Blackwood, Steiglitz,
Smythe’s Creek, and Buninyong.
The Blackwood party (five men) examined an extensive area of compara-
tively untried country, and during their researches a nugget of gold of 14


dwt. was found at the mouth of a blind gully near Doctor’s Creek, but no
ground of a remunerative character for mining operations was found near
the site of the discovery.
The Steiglitz party sank many shafts, varying from 10 to 38 feet in
depth, hut were unsuccessful in finding gold.
The Smythe’s Greek party (six men) sank shafts from 16 to 96 feet in
depth, equal to 530 feet of sinking, exclusive of 266 feet of drives, and were
also unsuccessful in their search for gold.
The Buninyong party (six men) sank about eighty shafts, from 3 to 23
feet deep, in various parts of the district allotted to them, and found small
quantities of gold, hut none of any value. They subsequently commenced a
rock tunnel at the foot of the Devonshire Range, and after driving 225 feet,
cut an auriferous quartz vein, which yielded such fair prospects that the
prospectors, at the termination of their engagement, continued to work the
mine on their own account.
In the Beechworth Mining District two parties of five men each were em-
ployed, who examined country near Murmungee and Alexandra.
The Murmungee party confined their operations to the Buckland Gap, as
offering the most favorable field for such work as they, with their limited
appliances, were able to explore. Two shafts were sunk from 40 to 87 feet
in depth, and 180 feet of driving was accomplished. Fair prospects of gold
were found in places, so that the party continued to work some time after
the termination of the period for which they were engaged, and other miners
also took up claims near the same place, hut no important discovery
followed.
The Alexandra party examined a good deal of country at the heads of
creeks in the Dividing Range, and found only traces of gold.
In the Castlemaine Mining District three parties, including thirteen men,
were engaged : their centres of operation were Daylesford, Steel’s Creek,
and Hoddle’s Creek.
The Daylesford party examined much country about Reedy, Wombat, and
Werrihee creeks, and about one mile south of Bullarto found a little fine
gold in the washdirt; at other places only traces of gold were found.
The Steel’s Creek party examined much rough country in the Main
Dividing Range and its spurs, and found only traces of gold.
The Hoddle’s Creek party (Upper Yarra) also tested country towards the
heads of several tributaries of the Yarra. Their only noteworthy discovery
was at a place known as Derlan’s Flat, where gold in small quantities
was traced through a depth of 30 feet of washdirt.
In the Gippsland Mining District three parties of five men each were
engaged to examine country in East and South Gippsland, and in the high
lands of the Omeo district.
The first was started with pack horses from Bairnsdale to explore the
densely wooded and little known country in the watersheds of the Broadbent,
Brodribh, and Goongreah rivers. Many banks and terraces on these rivers


and their tributaries were examined, and gold in small quantities fre-
quently found, but nothing of importance.
The party engaged for South Gippsland examined much rough auriferous
country at and near Turton’s Creek, and in the Hoddle Ranges, hut without
effecting any noteworthy discovery.
The Omeo party, under the direction of Mr. R. A. F. Murray, a geological
surveyor of the Department, examined the elevated country on either side of
the Main Dividing Range, at the heads of the Cohungra and Bundarah rivers,
and the edges of the basaltic high plain, from the latter to “ White’s claim,”
and also on several tributaries of the Kiewa, and at the head of Brandy
Creek. The party then crossed to the south side of the Divide, and pro-
spected the edges of the Dargo High Plain (basaltic), where encouraging
prospects of gold were obtained, Shafts were also sunk at the Pic-Nic
Creek and Little Dargo River. (See account of Mr. Murray’s survey of this
country.)
In the Maryborough Mining District eight parties, comprising forty-four
men, were engaged for Amherst, Avoca, Inglewood, Wedderhurn, Charlotte
Plains, Orville, Maryborough, and St. Arnaud. Much country was explored
by the several parties, hut the only discoveries worthy of note were made
by the prospectors from Amherst and St. Arnaud ; the former found small
quantities of gold some distance south of Glenmona station, and at the
expiration of the term for which they were engaged they worked out a
block of ground 15 feet by 12 feet, and obtained a yield of 2-) dwt. to
the load of washdirt. A small rush of miners set in to the place, but from
the difficulty of obtaining water for their operations the claims were soon
abandoned.
The St. Arnaud party found gold yielding 2 dwt. to the load of washdirt
from one of the cement hills, about six miles north-east of St. Arnaud.
In the Sandhurst District four parties, containing twenty-two men, were
respectively employed near Reedy Creek, Heathcote, Homebush, and Rush-
worth. None were successful in their search for gold ; but the operations at
the last-named ‘place led to the discovery of a new run of gold at the lower
end of the old lead, about two miles and a half east of Rushworth; and some
time after the party ceased to be employed by the Government, as many as
700 miners were working on the ground ; in some of the claims satisfactory
yields were said to have been obtained.
In compliance with a request from the Commissioners for Victoria for the
Paris Exhibition, a collection of minerals, rocks, fossils, &c., illustrative of
the geology and mineral resources of Victoria was obtained and classified
for exhibition at Paris, and a carefully compiled catalogue descriptive of the
specimens was prepared by Messrs. G. H. F. Ulrich and W. Nicholas to
accompany them. Although little time was afforded in which to obtain the
collection, I am pleased to relate that, by the energy of the surveyors,
registrars, and others who assisted in the work, and also by the timely and
generous presentation of valuable minerals by Messrs. Lansell, Field,


and other gentlemen connected with mining, no less than 1,500 specimens
were prepared for the Commissioners (exclusive of other exhibits) as classed
in the descriptions hereunder ;

In addition to the above, a special collection of quartz and other specimens
was forwarded from the mine of the Pandora Company, Garden Gully Reef,
Sandhurst, together with a plan of a cross section of the workings, showing
those portions of the mine from which the specimens were obtained.
Also—

REPOETS.
GEOLOGICAL SKETCH-MAP, SHEET No. 2, SOUTH-EAST
GIPPSLAND.-REPORT.
Sheet No. 2, south-east of the geological survey of Gippsland, represents an area
•of about square miles, within the following boundaries, viz.:—Commencing
at the intersection of the 147th meridian of longitude and the 38th parallel of
latitude; thence west along the latter 34 miles; thence north 40 miles; thence
east 34 miles 17 chains to the 147th meridian of longitude; and thence south along
the meridian to the commencing point.
The Main Dividing Range of the colony enters the sheet on the northern boundary
near the north-west corner, and after trending some distance south-easterly turns
to the west and passes out of the sheet, the bend thus formed including on its
western fall the heads of the Black River, a tributary to the Goulburn. A leading
spur (on which Mount Useful is a conspicuous point), starting from this bend in
the main range, extends down to the flat country near Seaton, and forms the divide
between the Macallister River on the east and the Thomson on the west. Included
in the south-west portion of the sheet are part of the Thomson River and its
eastern affluents the Aberfeldy, Donnelly’s Creek, Fulton’s Creek, Stringer’s
Creek, Deep Creek, and Stony Creek—all heading from the range last described.
Close to the Main Divide, on its eastern fall, run the two branches of the Barkly
River, which, after meeting one another, join the Macallister River heading from
the north; and the Macallister, fed by the Wellington River from the east, and the
Serpentine, Glenmaggie and other creeks from the west, traverses the block in a
south-easterly direction, passing out near the south-east corner close to Maffra. A
great leading spur between the Macallister and the Wonnangatta, leaving the Main
Divide at Mount Howitt, passes into the sheet on the northern boundary, and
about six miles south thereof forms the lofty Mount Wellington Range, whose
highest point at the trigonometrical station is 5,363 feet above sea level. From
the saddle immediately north of the trigonometrical station, head on one side the
Wellington River, running into the Macallister, and on the other a branch of the
Moroka River, running into the Wonnangatta.
The Mount Wellington Range terminates seven miles southerly from the trigono-
metrical station at Mount Wellington proper, a huge bluff forming a conspicuous
feature in the mountains; and from here a range at lower elevation continues southerly,
and forms the watershed line between the Macallister and the Avon, running out in
numerous broken spurs on the flat country of Upper Maffra and Wa-de-lock. On
one of these spurs in the Avon watershed is Ben Cruachan, another very con-
spicuous mountain, approaching 2,800 feet in elevation. The Avon River, heading
from the northern extremity of the Mount Wellington Range, and fed in its course
by several large tributaries on either side, flows southerly, and passes out of the


VIEW ACROSS THE MITCHELL RIVER VALLEY PROM NEAR GRANT


eastern boundary of the sheet in the flat country near Boisdale. From the Mount
Wellington trigonometrical station the leading range extends easterly for a few miles,
and then divides; one spur, running south, separates the Avon and Valencia Creek
down to their junction near Wa-de-lock; the other, running east, passes out of the
sheet, and, turning to the south at Castle Hill, continues as the western watershed
line of the Wonnangatta. A spur running from Castle Hill north-westerly re-
enters the sheet boundary near the north-east comer, where Mount Kent is its
highest point, and it thence descends to the junction of the Moroka and the Won-
nangatta, ending in the Snowy Bluff, a place of great geological interest, which,
though outside the limits of the sheet, will be hereafter described. The range
from Mount Wellington, by Castle Hill, round to Mount Kent, partly encloses the
picturesque valley of the Moroka, a broad open strath, forming the gathering-ground
of numerous small streams from the surrounding mountains.
With the about 160 square miles in the south-eastern corner of the (
sheet, occupied by Tertiary formations, and a few outliers of the same in the moun-
tains, the whole of the country described consists of Lower and Upper Palaeozoic
rocks. Subjoined is a list of the various formations in their order of superposition,
with the localities in which they occur, or are most developed.
Post-Teetiaet.
Most Recent. —Low flats of rivers, creeks, and gullies, both completed and in
progress.
Recent. —Wide plains of Heyfield, Maffra, &c., and raised flats.
Teetiaet.
Upper Tertiary (Pliocene). —Gravels and conglomerates, between Seaton and
Glenmaggie, Upper Maffra, and Wa-de-lock.
Middle Tertiary (Miocene). —Silicious conglomerates and gravels of Glenmaggie,
Seaton, Connor’s Plains, Mount Useful, &c. Older Volcanic overlying the above
in the same localities.
Uppee Palaeozoic.
Upper Devonian. —Sandstones and conglomerates, with interbedded lavas and
porphyries, shales and mudstones. Avon Eiver watershed; Wellington, Macallister,
and Moroka rivers.
(?) Devonian. —Limestones. Thomson Eiver and Deep Creek.
Lowee Palaeozoic.
Upper Silurian. —Country between Macallister and Thomson rivers.
Granite. —Head of a branch of the Avon.
Geanite.
Only one small outcrop of granite occurs within the sheet, and that is situated in
the bed of one of the branches of the Avon, five miles south from Mount Wel-
lington. As only a margin of the outcrop appears from beneath Upper Palaeozoic
rocks, it is impossible to say how far it may extend eastward as their foundation.
On the western side the Silurian abuts on it, and the creek, which follows the


junction of the Upper and Lower Palaeozoic for a short distance, has laid bare the
granite, as illustrated in the sketch-section (Fig. 1). The granite appears to be

tions of Granite, Silurian, and

River.
intrusive as regards the Silurian, but certainly is
not so as regards the Upper Devonian conglom-
erates, which rest on it undisturbed, and have at
one time covered it completely, as shown by the
outliers on the Silurian side of the creek. Coarse
and fine varieties of texture are met with in this
granite, and Mr. A. W. Howitt, who kindly exam-
ined for me a sample of the latter under the
microscope, described it as a crystalline granular
compound, consisting almost entirely of quartz
and orthoclase, neither being well crystallized,
plagioclase being nearly absent, and biatite mica
equally rare with plagioclase.
Silurian.
The Silurian rocks form the general basis of the whole country under notice, for
though the Upper Devonian rocks occupy all the eastern portion, the Silurian
appears from beneath them again, to the east of the sheet, in the Wonnangatta
valley. There exists, therefore, in the Silurian rocks a great trough occupied by
strata of Upper Devonian age, and this trough lies between the Silurian rocks west
of the Macallister and those east of the Wonnangatta, as illustrated in the accom-
panying sketch-section (Fig. 2).
FIG. 2.
Sketch-section illustrating relations of Silurian and Upper Devonian
rocks between the Barkly and Wonnangatta Rivers.
The Silurian rocks of the Thomson River are clearly part of the same series as
those of the Yarra and Wood’s Point districts, known from palseontological evidence
to be Upper Silurian; and those of the Wonnangatta are referred to the Lower
Silurian, on account of their apparently belonging to the same series with strata
containing Lower Silurian fossils.*
Assuming the classification of the Wonnangatta Silurian as Lower to be correct,
there must be somewhere between the Thomson and the Wonnangatta a line of
demarcation between the Upper and Lower Silurian. Having failed hitherto to
discover any palseontological evidence on the subject, this line of demarcation is
assumed to be concealed by the Upper Devonian rocks which occupy the great
trough above described between the Macallister and the Wonnangatta; and the
Silurian rocks exposed within the sheet are all provisionally classed as Upper
Silurian, pending the acquirement of further testimony. There is no noticeable

difference between the Silurian strata of this and other districts; the same highly
inclined sandstones, shales, and slates prevail throughout; the general strike being
north-westerly, and the dips varying north-easterly or south-westerly, according to
the flexures of the bands. The following are the principal of the observations
noted in various localities.
Thomson River, above the copper mine: alternate bands of bluish-grey hard
silicious grit and fissile indurated clay-slate, dipping N. 40° to 45° E. at 59°.
West branch of Stringer’s Creek, about a mile and a half from Walhalla : blue
slates and coarse sandstones, dipping E.N.E. at 58°.
Crossing of Aberfeldy, on Mount Look-out road : hard fissile greyish-blue schists,
dipping W.S.W. at 55°. Aberfeldy River, below Mount Lookout: hard slates
and sandstones, anticlinal, S.W. at 65° and N.E. at 62°. A similar anticlinal
appears in the workings of the Lily Mine, near the same place.
Upper portions of Donnelly’s Creek: slates and shales, with hard thick sand-
stone bands ; strike N.N.W. synclinal and anticlinal folds.
Along the track from Seaton to the Springs, near Donnelly’s: slates, with thick
bands of sandstone. At the Springs : curly purple and grey vertical clay-slates,
striking N. 40° W. ; near Mount Useful, strike N.W. ;on track from Mount
Useful to the Black River, strike N.W., dip S.W.
In the Serpentine Creek: slates, shales, and thick-bedded sandstones, striking
from N.N.E. to N.N.W., the most reliable observation being a strike N.N.W. and
a dip W.S.W. at 34°. In the Glenmaggie Creek, north from Seaton; whitish-
grey fissile, jointed sandstone, and thin bands of shale, dipping S. 35° W. at 81°.
In Macallister River, near Glenmaggie: slates, shales, and sandstones, dipping at
one spot N. 55° E. at 33°, and at another W.S.W. at 28°. In upper portion of
Ben Cruachan Creek: bluish-grey hard grits and indurated shales, bands of hard
silicious sandstone, and blue and grey clay-slates; dip nearly vertical, but, if any-
thing, inclined to the E.N.E ; strike N.N.W. The Silurian rocks appearing at the
base of the Snowy Bluff, north from the N.E. corner of the sheet, are slates and
sandstones, dipping E.N.E. at 42°.
Near Cooper’s Creek there is one small band containing very imperfect fossils,
such as I have seen in the Alexandra district; and near this is a singular band of
brown granular schist, containing nodules of intensely hard black silicious stone,
resembling some described in a previous report as occurring near Turton’s Creek,
in South Gippsland.
As a rule, the cleavage and
bedding of the Silurian rocks in
this district coincide, but one no-
table exception, near Walhalla,
was pointed out to me by Mr.
H. Rosales. A section occurs
beside a tram-
way along the
spur of “Little
Joe,” showing a
distinct syncli-
nal fold, in which the bedding
and cleavage planes are nearly at

and cleavage planes, “Little Joe” spur, near Walhalla.


right angles to one another. This I have endeavored to illustrate in the accom-
panying drawing (Fig. 3). An anticlinal fold more to the eastward, in the bed of
Little Joe Creek, exhibits similar features.
Limestones.
The few occurrences of limestone within the sheet are of Palaeozoic age, but
whether Upper or Lower has not yet been determined on palaeontological evidence,
the fossils obtained not being perfect enough to enable Professor McCoy to deter-
mine absolutely whether they were indicative of Upper Silurian or Devonian age.
The stratigraphical evidence, however, is in favor of the latter, as will presently be
shown, and these limestones are therefore here provisionally classed as Devonian.
In a report on South-Western Giippsland, in Progress Report No. 111., the strike
of some limestone near the Tyers River, which is clearly Silurian, being inter-
hedded with Silurian slates, was described as being in the direction of the limestone
near the Thomson River copper mine; but further examination of the latter has
shown that this is a mere coincidence.
The three localities where the limestones now under notice have as yet been
found to occur are—lst. On the north-western side of the Thomson River, near
the copper mine; 2nd. On the south side of the Thomson, about seven miles east
from the copper mine; and 3rd. About six miles easterly from Walhalla, on the
west side of the Deep Creek, a tributary to the Thomson.
The limestone in these localities occurs only in patches of limited extent, and
has not the appearance of forming bands in the Silurian strata, but, in the last-
named locality especially, rests on the upturned edges of the latter, and on this
account it is here classed as Devonian.
Near the Thomson River copper mine the limestone occupies a portion of the
sideling along which the Melbourne road has been cut, and here the excavations
for lime-burning expose blocks of hard bluish-grey limestone, resting apparently
on the brown granular schist, referred to at page 46 in the description of the Silurian
rocks. Down in the river the normal Upper Silurian rocks occur, but their inter-
stices are filled with calcareous matter, as if infiltrated from the limestone above.
Another limestone patch of small extent, and showing similar relations to the
Silurian rocks, occurs on the north side of Cooper’s Creek: from both places lime
of very superior quality is burned for local use. Professor McCoy supplies the
following note on the fossil specimens obtained here:—“ The specimens from this
locality are so exceedingly imperfect and ill-preserved as not to admit of exact
determination, with the exception of a mass of the Favosites Goldfusi indicative
of Devonian rocks, with which are traces of a lamelliferous coral closely allied to
Diplophyllum coespitosum, and small branching forms allied to Trematopora
ostiolata and Cladopora fibrosa ; also one Beyrichia closely allied to B. lata, and
a few crinoid stems of the Actinocrinus type. The general facies of these imper-
fect remains is as nearly indicative of Upper Silurian as of Devonian, and I would
draw your attention to the necessity and importance of a larger collection of speci-
mens being obtained from this locality.” I have subsequently made further search,
but could obtain nothing more satisfactory than those described.
The second patch referred to also appears simply to be an outlier, as the Silurian
rocks in the adjacent gully and on the Thomson River do not show any interbedded
limestone. Close to the limestone, calcareous matter from it seems to have impreg


nated the Silurian rocks, but unfortunately no good section could be obtained.
The limestone, which may also he termed an encrinital marble, is dark bluish -
grey, polishing nearly black, with white markings of the contained fossils. It
would be a valuable ornamental stone if in a more accessible place and in greater
quantity. Concerning specimens from here, Professor McCoy says:—“ This lime-
stone contains abundance of large crinoid stems of the Actinocrinus type, and some
traces of Gasteropoda, apparently of the genus Acroculia, too imperfect to render
determination possible, and a fragment of Bellerophon. It is impossible to deter-
mine the precise age of this rock for want of more perfect specimens, but I have
no doubt it is identical with that of Cooper’s Creek.”
The Deep Creek limestone forms a bluff, and, as clearly as can he seen under
the circumstances, rests on the upturned edges of the Silurian. Wombat burrows
at the base of the limestone cliff have gone
under it for a considerable distance, and the
material brought out consists of fragments of
Silurian shale and slate, which are visible in
situ in the creek below. The sketch-section
(Fig. 4) represents this occurrence—the best
evidence at present available as to the relation
of the limestone to the Silurian rooks. On
specimens from here Professor McCoy re-
marks :—“ In the small portion of this lime-

relations of Limestone ( ? Devo-
nian) and Silurian, Deep Creek,
branch of Thomson River.
stone forwarded there are only indeterminable fragments of crinoid stems and the
coral allied to Trematopora ostiolata found in the Cooper’s Creek limestone, with
which the stratum is no doubt identical.”
Even with the imperfect fossils obtained. Professor McCoy is enabled to express
an opinion that these three patches of limestone are identical in their geological
age, whatever that may he, and the stratigraphical evidence so far fully justifies
their being classified as they are. They may therefore be regarded as vestiges of
a once more extensive area of limestone denuded during the Upper Devonian,
Mesozoic, and Tertiary periods, till only the portions occupying the deeper hollows
in the Silurian were left.
The fact of the limestone resting on the upturned edges of the Silurian rocks
would show that the foldings of the latter, however effected, took place prior to
the deposit of the limestones.
Upper Devonian.
Before giving my own observations, reference must be made to the work accom-
plished by Mr. A. W. Howitt in the investigation of the Upper Devonian rocks of
North Gippsland.
In that gentleman’s paper in Progress Report No. 111. he gives very valid
reasons for regarding the Iguana Creek beds—referred on palasontological evidence
by Professor McCoy to the Upper Devonian—as of the same series, and continuous
"With those of Freestone Creek iu one direction and the Snowy Bluff in another.
Mr. Howitt shows how they are seen lying on the upturned edges of older
strata, and how they contain, interbedded with the shales, sandstones, and con-
glomerates, certain layers of felstone porphyry and basalt, which appear to have
been the lava-flows of Upper Devonian times, subsequently altered by chemical
H


action from their original condition. Having myself examined the Iguana Creek
beds, I traced them round to Freestone Creek, and found in the latter locality
fossil flora, among specimens of which Professor McCoy recognised Cordaites
Australis —a characteristic fossil of the Iguana Creek strata, and indicative of Upper
Devonian age, so that both oA stratigraphical and palaeontological evidence the
rocks of Iguana and Freestone creeks may be regarded as identical. Having
accompanied Mr. Howitt on a visit to the Snowy Bluff, and having with him
taken notes of the section thereof given by him in Progress Report No. IV.,
page 77, I reproduce it here from my own notes, as it will he necessary for com-
parison with others observed subsequently (Fig. 5).
In following from Freestone Creek northward the margin of the Upper Devonian
rocks, where they rest unconformahly on older strata, it was found that the
felstones, porphyries, &c., continue among the lower beds of the series as far as
explored in that direction, to about Valencia Creek, ten miles south from Castle
Hill. To absolutely establish their identity with the Snowy Bluff beds if would be
necessary to trace them round by Castle Hill and Mount Kent outside the limits of
the present sheet; this has not yet been done, hut probably will be soon, and in
the meantime their continuity may be safely assumed. The Barkly and Macallister
rivers form approximately the boundary between the Silurian and Upper Devonian
from the northern edge of the sheet down to Hickey’s Creek ; from here the
boundary between the two formations turns north-easterly along the Divide between
the Macallister and Avon, keeping the slope towards the former to a point on the
range between Mount Hump and Mount Wellington, whence it turns back southerly
into the Avon watershed, and, passing to the west of Ben Cruachan, recrosses the
Divide between the Macallister and Avon, and runs down to the former river at a
point nearly opposite the junction of Glenmaggie Creek.
Thus the upper portions of Ben Cruachan Creek and another branch of the Avon
heading from Mount Hump, which I have called Mount Hump Creek, are in
country consisting of Silurian rocks which form a tongue jutting into the Upper
Devonian area, whose lower beds lean against and dip from it on either side.
From Hickey’s Creek, crossing the heads of Warrigal and Snowy creeks
(branches of the Macallister) towards the west of Mount Hump, the lowest bed of
the Upper Devonian is a very coarse hreccio-conglomerate, consisting principally
of large angular fragments of the harder portions of the Silurian rocks ■on this
rest sandstones, shales, &c., followed by massive porphyritic felsite of great
thickness, on which lie the varying sandstones, conglomerates, and shales
comprising the sedimentary portion of the series. The sketch-section (Fig. 6) was

noted on the Divide between the Macallister and Ben Cruachan Creek, near the
head of Stony Creek.
Near the small outcrop of granite S.E. from Mount Hump the same breccio-
conglomerate rests on the Silurian and granite, but between it and the felsite are
many layers of basalts and melaphyres, with intervening sedimentary bands. The
section (Fig. 7) was noted along a spur rising from the bed of Mount Hump Creek

towards Mount Wellington, and Mr. A. W. Howitt has kindly supplied notes of
his microscopical examination of some specimens from the various hands which I
sent to him. It must be stated, however, that the conditions here were by no
means favorable for obtaining an accurate section, on account of the great quantity
of scrub, soil, and loose masses of rock. In the following general description of
the rocks numbered in the section, and others in the vicinity, are embodied notes
given me by Mr. A. W. Howitt, who has also promised to furnish a detailed
account of the results of his examination of them. The numbers are those attached
to the specimens sent, and appear in the section at the points where they were
obtained.
No. I.—A dark porphyritic felsite, similar to some at the Snowy Bluff.
No. 2.—A light greenish-grey rock, melaphyre, consists of a mass of concre-
tions, mostly containing quartz as a centre.
No. 3.—A hard dark-grey rock, melaphyre, basaltic in character, and con-
taining some concretions as in No. 2.
No. 4.—Hard, fine, olive-colored rock. Compact melaphyre of a basaltic
character.
No. s.—Exceedingly hard and compact ; light olive-green in color. Compact
felsite (felstone).
No. 6.—Light drab-colored, hard fine-grained felsite.
No. 7.—Quartz felsite, fine-grained base, with a few crystalline products of
quartz.
No. B.—(From loose piece in creek.) Melaphyre, apparently a completely
altered basaltic rock ; the concretions are of some mineral at present
undetermined, resembling epidote.


No. 9. —Mixed light-grey and purple rock from waterfall in Mount Hump
Creek, a mile above the point shown in the section. Apparently a portion
of highly altered rock, probably melaphyre ; the rock is very silicious.
No. 10. —Dark slate-colored fine dense rock, containing many concretionary
quartz geodes. Microcrystalline melaphyre, resembling some of the .varieties
of basalt of the Snowy Bluff.
The great porphyritic felsite mass forming the summit of the section extends to
and forms the southern and south-eastern portion of the base of Mount Wellington;
it has not yet been followed to the western side, though it probably extends there,
and thence to the Snowy Bluff ; it nowhere appears in the bed of the Main Avon,
being covered by sedimentary rocks.
Resting on the porphyry, and forming the cap of Mount Wellington proper, is a
hard glassy greyish-white melaphyre. Northward from Mount Wellington, con-
glomerates, thick-bedded, reddish-brown, and whitish sandstones and shale bands,
dipping E.S.E. at about 30°, continue to the trigonometrical station, and thence
round the Divide between the Avon and the Moroka valley. The Divide
extending from the Moroka valley, between the Avon and Valencia Creek down
to Little Plain, consists entirely of sedimentary rocks, sandstones of various
colors and textures, conglomerates and ruhbly red mudstones being the prevailing
forms.
Returning to the S.E. of Mount Hump, and following thence the Silurian and
Upper Devonian boundary southward, the same general phenomena are met with
to the base of Ben Cruachan, viz., immediately on the Silurian coarse conglomerate
or breccio-conglomerate, then melaphyres and felsites, and then the bulk of the
sedimentary sandstones, shales, and conglomerates. The continuity of particular
bands is not always distinctly traceable, and their relations in wide apart localities
are sometimes obscure, but the general features are the same. The felstone
porphyry resting on and overlaid by conglomerates is traceable along the Silurian
boundary from the north of Ben Cruachan to the Macallister River east of the
Glenfalloch pre-emptive right. There is an exposure in the bed of the Macallister,
at the west end of the Glenfalloch pre-emptive right, of very decomposed basalt,
which may either be the Tertiary Older Volcanic or a decomposed Devonian
melaphyre ; it has been colored as the former, which it most resembles, but there
is no positive evidence as to which it is.
The most south-westerly exposure of the Upper Devonian rocks in the sheet or
in Gippsland is at a spot called Alick’s Downfall, on the south side of the
Macallister, a few miles below Glenmaggie Creek, and here they consist of coarse
silicious conglomeritic sandstones, forming cliffs towards the river, and sloping
back under the Tertiary gravels by which they are hidden. From here along the
foot of the ranges to the Avon, and back from that line to the summit of Ben
Cruachan, none of the felsite or melaphyre hands have been met with ; various
conglomerates, sandstones, and red ruhbly shale bands being the prevailing
rocks. The sketch (Fig. 8) represents a small but rather picturesque gorge
in Nicholson’s Creek, between the Avon and Macallister; the rocks are
coarse silicious conglomerates, with intervening sandstone hands dipping south-
easterly.
The examination of the rocks of the Avon River and its tributaries was more
exhaustive than in any other part of the sheet, and the principal features noted are


here given, starting from the lowest point of exposure, at the junction of Valencia
Creek. At this point an antiolinical occurs, of which the accompanying is a

sketch (Fig. 9). The base of the section is a purple fine-grained rubhly shale,
over which are irregularly bedded layers of conglomerate, shale, and sandstone.
Two or three miles further up the Avon, near Mount Angus Creek, are thick-
bedded yellowish-brown micaceous sandstones, fissile, purple-brown and dark-red
fine sandstone, and the ruhbly purple mudstone, bands of which are very frequent
throughout the series : the dip here is S. 74° W. at 48®.
FIG. 10.
Avon River, top of Little Plain.
FIG. 9.
At the upper end of the alluvial flat of Little Plain is the locality where the
specimen of lepidodendron, figured in Professor McCoy’s Decade No. 1., is stated to
have been found, but further specimens of which I was unable, during long search,
to discover. The sketch (Fig. 10) shows the section observed at this spot; near
here are also shown, in the river bed, sandstones containing both rounded pebbles
and veins of quartz, a feature to which further notice will be hereafter given.
From here along the Main Avon, to a point east from Mount Wellington, con-
glomerates, sandstones, and rubbly shales prevail; the dips generally are south-
easterly, though they become more north of east abreast of Mount Wellington; the


angle of dip rarely exceeds 30°. I did not follow up the last few miles of the
head of the Avon, as it was evident from the character of the washed fragments
that there was no change. To the principal eastern head branch of the Avon I
have given the name of Turton’s River, running parallel as it does with the track
cut by Mr. W. Turton while engaged on the geodetic survey. In exploring
portions of this river nothing except the three above-mentioned forms of rock was
met with, nor were any rolled pieces of others seen. In following up Ben Cruachan
Creek from its junction with the Avon, no change from the above forms occurs
until reaching a point north-east from Ben Cruachan, where the conglomerate, in
addition to the usual constituents, contains boulders of melaphyre such as occur
further up the creek ; under this conglomerate are hard dark greyish-blue gritty
shales resting on porphyry. Apparently under the porphyry are hard sandstone
grits, and beneath them dark greenish-grey melaphyre, resting on hard dense sand-
stone and conglomerate. Other bands of melaphyre and porphyry, with intervening
sandstones and conglomerates, are met with up to the Silurian boundary, on which
lies coarse grey conglomerate. The sketch-section (Fig. 11) along the line of dip
of the beds, from the Silurian boundary to near Little Plain, illustrates the sequence
of the layers.
FIG. 11.
Sketch-section showing general sequence of Upper Devonian rocks along line of dip from the
Silurian boundary, north-west of Ben Cruachan to near upper end of Little Plain.
Enlarged sections illustrative of rocks between i and j in above section.


In the upper portion of MeColl’s Creek, which enters the Avon above Ben
Cruachan Creek, the hard greyish-blue shales above mentioned again occur, and
these are the only two places where they have been met with in the Avon water-
shed ; they are more horizontal than the superincumbent beds, and resemble some
(to be hereafter described) which occur in the Macallister. They appear in some
cases to fill in hollows and undulations in the porphyry; one section observed
would lead to the belief that the latter was intrusive, were it not for further evidence
as to the porphyry being an intercalated layer.
A lofty hill between the heads of McColl’s Creek and the eastern branch of
Ben Cruachan Creek shows a band of porphyry whose outcrop forms as it were a
belt round it,' sandstones and conglomerates appearing both above and below. Ben
Cruachan consists of alternating red rubbly mudstones, sandstones, and red sandy
conglomerates, the latter composing its summit.
In the country watered by the Macallister, the Wellington, and the Barkly, it is
noticeable that the conglomerate layers, though by no means absent, are fewer than
within the Avon watershed, and that the porphyries and melaphyres do not appear
at all, as far as the country has been examined, to the north-west of a line drawn
from about the Junction of the Serpentine Creek and the Macallister towards the
northernmost bend of the Moroka River.
Nothing is, however, yet definitely known about the country north of the present
sheet extending from between the Barkly and Wonnangatta northward to the
Main Divide; and beyond giving an account of the rocks noted, it will not be here
attempted to show their relation to those of the Avon except by the statement
that the stratigraphical evidence obtained so far and the general character of the
beds indicate that they are of the same series. Following up the Macallister from
Glenfalloch, brown micaceous sandstones with purple rubbly mudstones prevail to
the Junction of the Wellington, where a small section illustrative of the character
of the beds occurs as shown in Fig. 12 ; and no
special change of character occurs as far as the
Macallister and Barkly rivers were followed to-
wards the sheet line. The dip at the Junction of
the two branches of the Barkly is S.E. at 8° in
hard, gritty flags, overlaid by sandstones and red
rubbly shales. Some of the sandstones along the
Barkly are very thick-bedded, and form perpen-
dicular cliffs overhanging the river. In Glen cairn
Creek, near its Junction with the Barkly, are hard

River.
grey laminar gritty shales, resembling those described in Ben Cruachan Creek,
dipping S. 40° W. at 13 9 ; and further up towards the Glencairn homestead are
alternate hard sandstones and red mudstones, with the same direction of dip. In
the Macallister, east of Glencairn homestead, are red rubbly mudstones and shales
resting on coarse fissile yellowish-brown sandstone dipping S. 60° W. at 38°.
Higher up the river is another well-defined dip in similar rocks of S. 73° W.
at 41°.
With a few variations in character, and some fine conglomerate bands, the same
descriptions of rock are met with up to the summit of the Crinoline, a very con-
spicuous hill, about 4,500 feet in elevation, on the range between the Macallister
and the Wellington. The rocks here are nearly horizontal, and the outcrops of the


harder beds on either side of the hill form a succession of cliffs, with steep grassy
slopes between, which give the hill the appearance whence its name is derived
(Fig. 13).
FIG. 13.—“The Crinoline.”
From the summit of this hill the same appearances are visible in the ranges on
either side of the Macallister and Wellington as far as the eye can discern, cliffs
and buttresses of the harder rocks forming broken contour lines round the spurs of
the mountains.
In following up the Macallister from Glencairn the river holds at first a course
from the north, and then the main stream turns sharply, inside the sheet boundary,
and has a course from the east for several miles through deep gorges and precipitous
mountains walled with cliffs of the above-described rocks. Above the gorges are
small, open, gently-undulating plains covered with snow-grass, through which the
river winds, the surrounding tributary gullies containing moss beds and unfailing
springs of water.
A high hill overlooking these plains, and on the Divide between the Macallister
and Wellington, is named on the map Mount Tamboritha, as it appears to be the
one so named on the Government map of the colony. The summit consists of
sandstone, sometimes passing into conglomerate; and from here down to the Wel-
lington River are the prevailing sandstones and red rubbly shales. While following
the range from the Crinoline to Mount Tamboritha my companion and myself began
to suffer so severely from thirst that we decided to descend a mountain side of about
1,500 feet to the cascades which we could see in the Macallister below. After
scrambling down about half way we accidentally discovered a magnificent spring of
pure ice-cold water issuing from the solid rock with a velocity and volume equal to
about two sluice-heads of water.
The position of this spring is shown approximately on the map, and it indicates
that there must be some subterranean passage by “which the water comes from
higher country, probably that in which the plains are situated.
The portions of most interest to be yet examined in the southern part of the
Upper Devonian area are its eastern margin, from Freestone Creek to Castle Hill,


Mount KRnt, and the Snowy Bluff, and a small tract lying immediately west of the
range between Mount Hump and the Mount Wellington trigonometrical station.
The first is nearly certain to afford geological features of interest hearing on the
relations of the Snowy Bluff beds with those of Freestone and Iguana creeks. In
the second locality I have lately learned on good authority that serpentine has been
found, and that the samples of chrome iron mentioned in Progress Report No. 111.,
page 172, came from the same place. I had proposed making the above investiga-
tions before sending in this report, hut being occupied in the Dargo and Bogong
country during the latter part of the autumn I was unable to carry out the intention
before the winter set in. I trust that I may yet be able to do so in time to furnish
the result in the form of an appendix hereto.
Among the Devonian sandstones are beds of good description for building
purposes ; the sandstone from the Freestone Creek quarries is used throughout the
district, and will probably be more extensively employed when railway communi-
cation is established with Melbourne.
A very good description of hard fissile grit, suitable for flagging, occurs in
Nicholson’s Creek, below the gorge, and at other places along the foot of the
ranges between Nicholson’s and Freestone creeks, are sandstones which, from their
appearance, would yield good building stones if properly opened into.
Nowhere have I mot with the least indication of coal in these rocks, and I could
hardly have escaped seeing it if it existed at all. A little fine gold is reported to
have been found in Nicholson’s Creek and a few other places, but in no case could
I hear of anything approaching a payable prospect being obtained.
In conclusion, it may be remarked that the evidence obtained leaves no doubt as
to the rocks of Freestone and Iguana creeks and those of the Avon belonging to
the same series ; the former have been shown on paleontological evidence to be of
Upper Devonian age, and therefore the latter must be Upper Devonian also. At
the same time it may be stated that the rocks where the lepidodendron—indicative
of Lower Carboniferous age —was said to have been found are among the upper-
most exposed beds of the series, and the presence of lepidodendron may indicate
the proximity of the line of demarcation between Upper Devonian and Lower
Carboniferous rocks, which latter, if they ever existed in this part of the country,
have been entirely removed, unless portions remain under the Tertiary country
between the foot of the ranges and the seacoast.
Middle Tertiary (Miocene).
The northernmost and most elevated occurrence of deposits of this age within
the present sheet is at Connor’s Plain, on the Main Dividing Range, between the
Barkly and Black rivers. Here, at an elevation of between 5,000 and 6,000 feet
above sea-level, is a basaltic plateau about half a square mile in extent, under which
are beds of hard silicious rock and conglomerate, clays, sands, and gravels, resting
on the Silurian bed-rock.
A tunnel is said to have been driven into the gravel and fine gold obtained ; but,
having no one acquainted with the locality with me when there, I failed to dis-
cover it.
A few miles south, at the point where the Main Divide turns to the west, and at
a somewhat lower elevation, is Fullarton’s Spring Hill, a similar basaltic plateau
underlaid by the same deposits. The next occurrence, though of smaller area, is

Mount Useful, on the Divide between the Macallister and Aberfeldy rivers, where
there are beneath the basaltic cap of the mount beds of intensely hard conglomerate.

consisting of quartz pebbles and sand cemented
with yellowish-grey silicious matter. The sketch-
section (Fig. 14) represents the mode of occur-
rence in the three instances, and it is noticeable
that in all of them the Silurian bed-rock rises
higher on the eastern than on the western side,
showing these remaining vestiges to be portions
of the eastern margin of a Miocene valley, the
main bed of which has been removed by denuda-
tion.
Though no palaeontological evidence has been found, I have no hesitation in
classing these gravels as Miocene ; their elevation and general character leave no
room for doubt as to their being of the same age as, and formed under similar con-
ditions to, those of the Dargo and Bogong High Plains, where fossil flora, described
by Professor McCoy as Miocene, are of plentiful occurrence. Outside the western
boundary of the sheet is Mount Lookout, resembling geologically the points last
described, and along the spur between the Aberfeldy and the Thomson rivers, at
gradually descending elevations, are several small patches and outliers of basalt
and silicious conglomerate, evidently portions of a once continuous and extensive
formation.
There are no evidences of the Mesozoic rocks having once covered the country
under notice, though it is possible that they did so. Leaving that an open question,
the outline geological history, applicable to this and other parts of the colony, is
that, after the Upper Palaeozoic (Devonian) rocks had been deposited on the great
Silurian and granite rock foundation, ensuing denudation (probably during Mesozoie
times) removed them again from all but the deeper hollows and troughs in the
Silurian which they occupied, so that the section across the country from Mount
Lookout to the Bogong Ranges would probably have been, at the commencement of
the Tertiary epoch, as represented in the ideal sketch (Fig. 15).
The rivers of the Lower and Middle Tertiary periods taking their courses approxi-
mately along the boundary lines between the Lower and Upper Palaeozoic altered
the sectional configuration to that represented in Figure 16, and deposited their
gravels, sands, and clays in the beds of the valleys they had scooped out. Then
came volcanic eruptions, which poured streams of lava down the valleys, partly, and
in some places wholly, filling them, covering the deposits in their beds, and forming
basaltic plateaux with intervening ridges of the Palaeozoic rocks. The section was
then as represented in Figure 17, and subsequent denudation, from the cessation of
the lava-flows till now, has more or less altered the surface configuration of the
whole country, reducing the general level of, and cutting deep valleys into, the
Palaeozoic rocks, removing large areas of the Miocene, Tertiary, and Volcanic forma-
tions, and leaving portions of the basaltic flows, once filling valleys, in the position
of high plateaux on the watershed lines of the present day.
This present condition is illustrated in the sketch-section (Fig. 18) from Connor’s
Plain across the bight in the Main Divide, past the Snowy Bluff to another portion
of the Main Divide above Mayford, on the Dargo ; and the section could, I under-
stand, be extended, showing similar conditions round into New South Wales.

An extract from Professor Juke’s Manual of Geology, third edition, page 690,
has been brought under my notice by Mr. A. W. Howitt. As far as denuding
agencies and the period of their activity are concerned, the instance noted in the
Hebrides is analogous to what has been described above, and the extract is copied
here as affording a parallel in another part of the world of what was taking place
in this country during the same geological period :—“ Another and striking piece
of evidence (i.e., as to the long continuance of volcanic action during Miocene times
among the Hebrides) is given by the well-known Sour of Eigg. That island
consists of nearly horizontal sheets of basaltic rocks, like those of Mull, resting
unconformably upon oolitic rocks. After their eruption they must have been long
exposed to the wasting agencies of the atmosphere. A valley was cut out of them,
and its bottom was watered by a river which brought down shingle and sand from
the distant Cambrian mountains of the north-west. These changes must have
demanded a lengthened lapse of time, yet they took place during an interval in the
volcanic history of the island. The igneous force which had been long dormant
broke out anew, and poured several successive coulees of vitreous lava (pitch-stone)
down the river bed. In this way the channel of the stream came to be sealed up,
but the same forces of waste which had scooped out the channel continued their
operations. The hills which had bounded the valley crumbled away, and the lava
currents that filled the river bed being much harder than the surrounding rock were
enabled in a great measure to resist the degradation. Hence the singular result
now appears that the former hills have been levelled down into slopes and valleys,
while the ancient valley occupies the highest ground in the neighborhood, and its
lava current stands up as the well-known precipitous ridge of the Scur of Eigg.
Theygravel and drift-wood of the old river-bed are still to be seen under the rocks
of Scur.”
On the west side of the Thomson River, at the head of Cooper’s Creek, is an
area of Older Volcanic, beneath which are heavy deposits of gravel and silicious
conglomerate, to all appearance the continuation of those from Connor’s Plain,
Mount Useful, and Mount Lookout, the intervening portions having been removed
during the erosion of the Thomson and Aberfeldy valleys. I believe that future
investigations during preparation of the next geological sheet will show that these
are also portions of a lead similar to that which passes through Tangil, and runs
under the Upper Tertiaries at the Haunted Hill, as described in the report on South-
Western Gippsland, Progress Report No. 111.
Having nothing to add as to the Tertiaries of Glenmaggie, I here reproduce the
notes and sketches thereof already published in Progress Report No. IV.
Tertiaries op Glenmaggie.
The various sedimentary and volcanic Tertiary formations of Gippsland, being
well represented at Glenmaggie, permission was obtained from Major Couchman,
Acting Secretary for Mines, to make a detailed survey on a scale of 40 chains
to 1 inch of a small area in that locality. The map is sufficiently complete to
accompany and illustrate the present report, but is not in all respects a reliable
delineation of the geology of the district, because in its preparation I have been
guided by surface indications alone, and these are too frequently of a vague and
unsatisfactory character. As the Glenmaggie district is one presenting auriferous


indications, it is to be hoped that my application to be allowed to prospect it
will he granted, and the double object gained of testing the locality for gold and
ascertaining the relations of the formations.
The range of hills dividing the Macallister River from
Glenmaggie Creek is, for a few miles up from their
junction, comparatively low, and consists of Silurian rocks
overlaid by volcanic and sedimentary Tertiaries. A
rough section drawn across from the upper portion of the
Glenmaggie Creek to its junction with the Macallister,
would be that in the attached sketch (No. 14a).
As followed northward, the base of these Tertiary
deposits rises far above the existing river level, while
to the south they can be followed till they pass beneath
the bed of the Glenmaggie Creek, and are lost to the
south thereof under the wide expanse of Upper Tertiary
deposits which flank the foot of the ranges. There are
rocks and gravels of apparently Middle Tertiary or
Miocene age : a lava-flow resembling in character the
older volcanic, and gravels and ferruginous cement beds
to all appearance overlying, and more recent than, the
volcanic. These last, described on the map as Upper
Tertiary, appear to be identical with those termed
Pliocene on the geological map of South-Western
Gippsland—such as the gravels of “ The Ridge,” near
Rosedale, Tom’s Cap, and other places.
There are distinct indications of an old river-course or
lead, now filled in by basalt, from the Stony Creek down
to and through the Glenmaggie pre-emptive right; its
northern extension beyond Stony Creek is not yet
ascertained, but the basalt is visible in place in or
near the bed of a tributary of the Glenmaggie Creek,
down to and through the pre-emptive right, and again
in the bed of a creek to the south-east thereof. In the
natural sections exposed the basalt rests occasionally
directly on the Silurian, but in other places separated
from it by thick beds of intensely hard cherty silicious
rock, and conglomerate precisely similar to that de-
scribed in the report on the geology of South-Western
Gippsland. The silicious rock thins out as the Silurian
rocks rise on either side of the old channel, and does not
appear to occupy its bed, which apparently contains a
a Silurian. b Volcanic and sedimentary Tertiaries.
gravel deposit, a few indications of which are here and there met with. This
gravel would therefore appear to be somewhat more recent than the silicious rock,
and the section, if exposed, would probably be as indicated on the ideal sketch-
section (No. 146).
The actual sections observed are illustrated in sketches Nos. 14c, 14 d, 14e.
Rolled boulders of the silicious rock, polished like glass, are frequent on the low
spurs in Glenmaggie pre-emptive right, and associated with them are pieces of


highly silicified wood, apparently once embedded in the rock itself. There is
a deposit of gravel forming hills above the level of the volcanic, but traceable to
FIG. 14b.—Sketch-section (ideal).
lower elevations and beneath it. This gravel may be of the same age as the
silicious rock beds, or the gravel in the old channel, but the evidences are too
obscure to admit of an opinion being expressed
until some holes are sunk to prospect the gravels
and ascertain their relations to other deposits.
The modes of occurrence of the gravel re-
ferred to and the silicious rock, together with the
doubtful character of
their relations is il-
lustrated in sketch-
section No. 14 d.
The volcanic rock,
where solid, is a
dense, hard, dark
basalt, but is usually
much decomposed,
and resembles the true older more than the
newer volcanic ; it appears to be of the same
age as the basalt covering the lead at Tangil,
and fills in the old river bed above mentioned,
spreading over some of the adjoining hills;
that it once covered a more extensive area is
shown by the outlying patches left unremoved
by the denuding agencies which formed the ex-
isting creeks and gullies.
To the south of the Glenmaggie Creek are tracts of
country consisting of quartz gravel and ferruginous
cement, somewhat higher than the basaltic hills in the
pre-emptive right, and sloping southwards towards
the plains ; they sometimes rest on the Silurian and
are visible in one place resting on the Middle Tertiary
silicious rock. At the boundary with the basalt, how-
ever, the surface indications so blend the characteristics
of both formations that it cannot be seen whether the
gravels rest on the basalt or the basalt on them ; these
two possible modes of relation are indicated in sketches
Nos. 14/and 14#.
FIG. 14c.
FIG. 14 d.
FIG. 14e.
FIG. 14f.
FIG. 14 g.


The former view, as shown in No. 14 f is here adopted, because a few miles
distant, near Seaton, a clear section is found of similar gravels overlying basalt,
which is again underlaid by other gravels (sketch No. 14A).
FIG. 14 h.
A few holes would solve this problem and also test the auriferous quality of the
gravel.
The deposits classed as “ Recent ” are those of the age of the Sale and Heyfleld
plains, consisting of soil, loam, clay, and occasionally sand or gravel; they are of a
higher elevation than, and usually divided by a distinct line of demarcation from,
the most recent deposits of river and creek flats, morasses, &c., an abrupt bank, as
in sketch-section 14*, showing the boundary.
FIG. 14i.
Gold Workings.
Alluvial.
The alluvial workings in this sheet are confined to the beds or terraces on the
banks of creeks and rivers. A few men still earn a livelihood on Donnelly’s Creek
and the Aherfeldy, and some of the terrace drifts along the Thomson are being
remuneratively worked ; but rich alluvial yields for a large population are now
things of the past as regards the area under notice, and though there are no doubt
creeks and gullies still unprospected which would afford temporary employment to a
small number, the main hopes of future mining prosperity are centred in quartz mining.
Quartz.
In his excellent paper published in Progress Report No. IY., Mr. William
Nicholas points out the existence, in this colony, of seven main groups of auriferous
quartz reefs, and one of these includes the reefs of Stockyard Creek, Russell’s
Creek, Walhalla, Jericho, Donnelly’s Creek, Wood’s Point, Gaffney’s Creek,
Jamieson, Big River, and Alexandra.
The portions of this group included in the present sheet are the reefs of
Donnelly’s Creek and those of Aherfeldy and Walhalla, occurring in two separate
belts, 5 miles apart, between which the most marked distinction of character is
that, in the first—the Donnelly’s Creek belt—no dykes of any kind have yet been
found in or near the quartz workings, while, in the Walhalla and Aherfeldy belt,
the quartz lodes accompany large well-defined dykes of felstone and diorite.








The Donnelly’s Creek belt consists, as far as is yet known, of two main lines of
reef about 600 feet apart. The eastern is known at its northern portion —worked
by the Florence Gold Mining Company —as the Florence or Crinoline Reef ; at the
southern, worked by the Gippsland Consols Company, as Edwards’ Reef. It is
clearly, however, the same line of reef, though there are several different veins and
varieties in their modes of occurrence. As may be seen by reference to the accom-
panying plan of Donnelly’s Creek (Fig. 19), the cap of the Florence Reef crosses a
saddle in a lofty range separating Crinoline Creek, one of the northern heads of
Donnelly’s,' from the main creek. At this point it appears at surface as a single
reef about a foot thick, but below divides into three, as shown in diagram (Fig. 20).
The eastern and middle or magazine lodes at first diverge downwards and then
join again at about 300 feet below the cap. The western lode, though its “ track ”
only remains at that depth, continues to diverge from the others as far as yet
followed.
On their strikes, in both directions from the cap on the saddle, the lodes
diverge.
The shoots of gold in this reef do not appear to have been found continuous,
though they have been very rich in patches, and better stone than worked for some
time has lately been struck in a deeper adit. The lodes vary in thickness from a
few inches to several feet. The eastern and magazine lodes, after joining, pass
away into a hard sandstone belt, in which they have not as yet proved remunera-
tive.
The old surface workings on the Harp and Edwards’ reefs, and those of the
Gippsland Consols Company at deeper levels, show the two lodes to underlie
towards and across one another, the continuation of the eastern reef below the
intersection being also cut by a number of minor veins ; these points of intersection
appear, in many cases, to have been the richest. The sketch-section (Fig. 21)
conveys a general idea of their mode of occurrence ; but so numerous are the veins
and intricate the various old workings that it is impossible, without a detailed
survey, to give an accurate delineation.
On the eastern side of the gully, trending northerly from the outcrop of the Harp
and Edwards’ reefs, a lode has lately been struck which is apparently the lower
continuation of the Harp reef. It is here 4 feet in thickness at the deepest
level, carrying payable gold, principally on the walls, and has the appearance, as
indicated in the diagram (Fig. 22), of two distinct veins in contact with one another.
A singular twist which occurs is also represented in the diagram, as well as two
veins which show in the adit as if going to join the main lode below. Between
the Gippsland Consols and Florence workings the character of the lodes is as yet
unknown, but they appear to be the same line of reef, notwithstanding local
variations, and will probably be more developed at no distant period.
The main western Donnelly’s Creek line of reef is the United Star line, a single
lode, worked at present by the Sterling, Hit-or-Miss, and Bismarck companies.
The general bearing is from N. 30° W. to N. 40° W. ; its underlay is south-
westerly, usually at from 75° to 85°, though in one place as low as 36° ; the
auriferous quartz occurs in successive shoots, which dip northerly, the “ track ” and
walls of the lode between the “ shoots ” being clearly defined even where quartz is
absent. In workings, at present idle through litigation, on the north side of
Crinoline Creek, a shoot which yielded richly has passed under foot and will have

to be recovered by sinking. (See Fig. 26.) The section in the north end of
the tunnel is as shown in the diagram (Fig. 23). This line has not been further

explored to the north, and it is uncertain whether
the White Star line towards Mount Useful, now
abandoned, is a continuation of this or the Crinoline
Reef.
On the south side of Crinoline Creek the Sterling
Company have driven a tunnel for a distance of
over 1,000 feet along the clearly defined “ track ”
of the lode ; except occasional small veins indi-
cating the possibility of shoots of stone above or
below, the tunnel has not met with any defined
quartz lode whatever, though in some of the
veins, galena, pyrites, and zinc-blende were
abundant, and these minerals are regarded as almost unfailing accompaniments
or indications of the proximity of auriferous quartz.
The diagrams (Figs. 24 and 25) show sections of the face of the Sterling tunnel
at various stages. South of the Sterling, and occupying the crown of the range, is
the claim of the Hit-or-Miss Company, whose ground is at present untouched,
though, as will be shown presently, its development is being rapidly proceeded
with. To the south of the Hit-or-Miss is the ground of the Bismarck Company,
from which very rich yields have been and are likely to be again obtained.
There are several shoots of auriferous stone in this ground, all of them dipping
north-westerly along the strike. The southernmost, which is the principal shoot
yet worked, is about 70 feet in length, and has been worked down from its outcrop
360 feet; to reach it at a lower level an adit of about 1,000 feet has been put in,
and, having intersected the “ track ” of the lode, is being driven north-westerly
along it for the continuation of the shoot (Fig. 26). The thickness of stone in this
shoot was 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet, of which about 6 inches on the footwall was
good, the rest being poor. Some of the good stone yielded as much as 20 oz. per
ton. Here is also an appearance of a double reef like that described in the
Gippsland Consols workings, a well-defined line of parting being visible between
the two portions (Fig. 27). The lowest tunnel (excepting the adit now being
driven), after passing through the main shoot, struck some smaller ones and then came
to a break in the lode, where it was thrown slightly to the west by a cross-course
bearing 240° and dipping S.S.E.; its course was recovered again and followed to
about 70 feet from the Hit-or-Miss boundary with slightly improving aspect. In
an underlay shaft from this tunnel, on the main shoot, the walls of the lode from
about 9 feet apart came nearly together, the golden stone adhering to the footwall
to the point of meeting and turning back along it when the walls resumed their
normal course' (Fig. 28). An upper tunnel followed a shoot till it broke off,
forming a remarkable curve, which is represented in the diagram (Fig. 29). Beyond
the curve, on the line of the lode, a “ dig ” was followed a short distance, and at
the end of the drive the walls are wider apart and show a little quartz.
The Hit-or-Miss Company having arranged with the Bismarck Company for the
use of the tunnel, mentioned as being 70 feet from their boundary, pushed it forward,
and at about 20 feet from the boundary came upon a splendid shoot of stone, on which
they are now driving at or near the boundary line. I saw the commencement of


STERLING TUNNEL


the shoot in the drive, and it then only appeared at the top of the face in a wedge
shape, as shown in diagram (Fig. 30), but has since, I learn, extended down the
whole face to a width of 2 feet, carrying excellent
gold.
This shoot, like the others, dips north-westerly and
underlies south-westerly ; its length is as yet unproved,
and it is supposed to be a continuation of the shoot in
the upper workings of the Bismarck which was found to
be broken.
The good stone in the Donnelly’s Creek mines is
usually well laminated, and both between the 1 ami me
and in the solid stone are galena, zinc-blende, iron and
copper pyrites, associated with the gold. On the track
from Seaton to Donnelly’s are quartz workings known
FIG. 30.

as the Boy’s Reef. Being abandoned at the time of my visits, I could not
examine them, but I hear that the formation consists of a succession of leaders
with indications of ultimately forming into a good solid auriferous lode. This
is in the general line of strike of the Donnelly’s Creek reefs ; and in the country
between the two places on that line there is every likelihood of other “ makes ”
of stone being found.
To the east of the Florence line are the old workings of the London and
Excelsior companies on two thick parallel bands of hard bluish-grey sandstone,
containing nearly flat veins of quartz. They were worked under the mistaken
impression that they were dykes like those of the Wood’s Point district, hut proved
unremunerative. The bands strike N. 30° W. and dip N. 60° E.
As the alluvial workings of Donnelly’s Creek and its branches start principally
from the Florence and Edwards’ Reef line, and very little gold appears to have been
found above, it would appear that there were no auriferous reefs of any importance
to the eastward within that watershed.
A number of reefs do exist, not only there, but in the Macallister watershed as far
as the Silurian rocks extend, but none of the trials yet made by prospectors have
proved successful. It may therefore be one of those barren belts known to intervene
between auriferous ones.
I may take this opportunity of acknowledging the information and assistance
courteously rendered by Mr. R. H. Bake, manager of the Florence, Sterling, and
Hit-or-Miss mines ; Mr. E. Keelan, of the Gippsland Consols ; and Mr. Grant, of
the Bismarck.
The northernmost mine on the second belt of quartz reefs, that in which the '
quartz veins are associated with dykes, is the Lily mine, principally owned and
managed by Mr. John A. Wilson, who showed me the workings.
The general bearing of the line of reef is N. 40° W., and there are two lodes—■
an eastern and western —which bifurcate from a single lode immediately below
where the latter intersects a diorite dyke. The western vein keeps along the dyke
which forms the hanging wall ; and the eastern vein, after underlying to the north-
east, turns and underlies south-westerly. This is shown in the diagram (Fig. 31).
The lodes vary from a few inches to 12 feet in thickness along their course, and
the gold does not seem to be established in a well-defined shoot, but irregularly,
some portions being good and others poor. The strata in the mine show several
K


singular contortions, a drive easterly exhibiting on its wall curves in the strata as
represented in the sketch (Fig. 32).
FIG. 31.

FIG. 32.

In this mine an adit is being put in which will afford
more information, and as the boundary of the sheet to be
next surveyed passes close to it I will probably be able
to add as an appendix hereto a more detailed account.
In the Aberfeldy mine, south-east from the Lily on the
opposite side of the Aberfeldy River, the reef has a bear-
ing of from N. 30° W. to N. 40° W. with a south-
easterly underlay, and a diorite dyke runs parallel with
it to the eastward. In the mine adjoining on the south-
east (late Stratford and Avon Company), the reef is
similar, but it is said that the auriferous shoots in the
Aberfeldy mine dip south-east, while in the Stratford
and Avon they dip north-west, along the strike of the
lode. Both these mines appear likely to yield good
returns if properly worked, and the former has been im-
proving since it came into the possession of the present
proprietor, Mr. J. Rice. Very rich stone has been worked here, and will doubtless
be found to continue at deeper levels, for which a shaft would be required. The
Stratford and Avon mine could be easily prospected on the surface for shoots
below those already worked on the crown of the range. Several hundred feet of
vertical height intervene between the lowest workings and the creek bed at the
southern end of the ground, so that if, as stated, the shoots dip north-westerly, the
outcrops of any others that exist below would certainly be found on the side of
the hill. Both these mines need further development before a reliable detailed
account can be given of the modes of occurrence of the lodes.
The Dream and Mountaineer mines, approximately on the same line as those last
mentioned, were not being worked when I was in the vicinity, so I did not visit
them. They are reported to have dykes along with the quartz veins.
The principal lines of reef near Walhalla are Cohen’s Reef, Longfellow’s Reef,
Happy-go-Lucky Reef, and that worked by the Fear-not Company.
Taken as a whole the line of Cohen’s Reef has a strike N.N.W., and an underlay
W.S.W. There are two principal quartz lodes, known as the eastern and western
lodes, and in the Walhalla mine a third, known as the first eastern vein, which
branches from the eastern lode and diverges northward.
The eastern and western lodes meet in an apex above, and join again below,
both lines of meeting dipping N.N.W.’ly along the strike, and the intermediate
space being occupied by a felstone dyke. There are portions of the line of lode
where the dyke stone alone is met with ; others where the western lode alone
occurs, and others where both dyke stone and quartz are absent, but the walls of
the lode remain distinctly apparent, being either close together or slightly separated
with jumbled and decomposed slate filling the intervening space. The lodes some-
times occur in the body of the dyke, but more usually on either wall, the dyke
occupying the intermediate space. The main shoot thus consists of the dyke and
the two lodes ; their apex dipping N.N.W.’ly in the line of strike at an angle of
about 32° ; auriferous quartz, however, continues for some distance both above the
apex and below the lower junction of the two lodes. The diagrams given will














afford a clearer idea than any written description of the features of this line. The
longitudinal section (Fig. 33) shows the shoot as found in the North Gippsland,
Walhalla, and Long Tunnel mines ; the downward continuation of the main shoot
in the Walhalla, and the new “ make ” in the No. 5 and No. 6 levels of the Long
Tunnel, the discovery of which goes to substantiate an opinion expressed in a former
report as to the occurrence of other shoots below the main one. Figs. 34 and 35
give a general idea of the cross-sections of the line of lode near the shafts of the two
mines. Figs. 36 to 41, and 42 to 48, show various modes of occurrence of the
dyke and lodes in the two mines. The lodes vary in thickness from a few
inches to 12 feet in the eastern and 22 feet in the western lode. The presence of
arsenical pyrites in the dyke is regarded as an unfailing indication of the proximity
of good quartz in the lodes; besides, arsenical pyrites, bournonite, iron-pyrites, and
galena are of plentiful occurrence.
Mr. H. Rosales, manager of the Walhalla mine, in addition to giving me every
assistance in examining the workings, was kind enough to revise some of my draw-
ings, and to allow me the use of his own. Without this help no information could
have been given as to the upper workings, which had been stoped and filled up
prior to my visits. Mr. Ramsay Thomson, manager of the Long Tunnel mine, and
Mr. Symons, underground manager, were most courteous in showing me all points of
interest in the workings. In some of the mines south of the Walhalla claim other
shoots of auriferous quartz have been partly worked, and in all cases have been
found to dip northerly along the strike : their continuance will probably be found
at a greater depth in the northern mines.
The Long Tunnel Extended Company will also meet with the shoot now being
worked by the Long Tunnel Company, though at a considerable depth, probably
900 feet.
A plan and section. Figs. 49 and 50, by Mr. A. F. Walker, mining surveyor, are
here given as excellent general illustrations of Cohen’s and other lines of reef.
Figs. 51, 52, and 53 are copies of drawings by the same gentleman, illustrating the
Longfellow’s Reef, a line approximately parallel with, and half a mile to the west of
Cohen’s line, but having an easterly underlay. This reef is also accompanied by a
diorite dyke.
Supposed to be on the same line as the Longfellow’s, but considerably to the
northward, is the reef now being worked for by the Fear-not Company. In the old
workings the upper tunnel was driven along a reef bearing about N. 15° W. and
underlying E. 15° N. at 53°. A soft decomposed diorite dyke, 4 feet thick, occurs
to the east of the sandstone hanging wall. In this level the reef thins out north-
ward to a small vein, but the shoot of auriferous stone dips under foot southerly
(Fig. 54).
In the lower tunnel a reef was cut just where the survey made by Mr. O. P. White-
law showed it as likely to be from the data obtained in the upper tunnel ; this reef
is auriferous, but no crushings have been made.* No dyke stone has been met with;
so either this is not the same as the reef worked above, or else the dyke is absent
from the portion intersected. Further working can alone decide this question.
Sketch Fig. 55 shows the appearance of the face in the drive along the lower level.
* Trial crushings made since have proved payable auriferous quartz to exist.


Southward from Walhalla is the Happy-go-Luoky Eeef, not being worked at
present. From inspection of the old workings and information given me by Mr.
Archer, manager of the South Cohen’s mine, I was enabled to make the drawings
(Figs. 56 to 59) illustrating what is known of the reef. Its strike is N. 15° to
20° E., and it has a very low underlay, N. 70° to 75° W. No dyke has been
found associated with the quartz, but one is visible to the eastward.
The workings on the Girl’s Reef, on the eastern branch of Stringer’s Creek, have
been idle for some years, but from what I saw of them the existence of large bodies
of diorite dyke-stone in association with the veins was evident.
Walhalla Copper Mine.
The Walhalla copper mine is situated on the eastern side of the Thomson River,
opposite the junction of Cooper’s Creek, and about five miles from Walhalla. At
the outcrop, 250 to 300 feet above the river, is a diorite dyke containing much
hornblende, with copper pyrites disseminated and in veins. These are decomposed
near the surface and converted into carbonates, sulphates, and oxides of copper,
with which is associated brown iron-ore, probably a similarly produced result from
the decomposition of iron-pyrites. The ore occurs as a “ shoot,” the general strike
of which is N. 15° W., with a dip in the same direction, and an underlay easterly
at a high angle. The ore-bearing portion of the dyke is about 120 feet long at the
surface, with a total thickness in parts of 25 feet. In the upper tunnel the shoot
is only about 60 feet long, but the ore is here a solid vein, from a few inches up to
4 feet iu thickness. In the lower tunnel the lode was struck at 376 feet; its
bearing here is N. 12° W., and its thickness 1 foot 6 inches, thinning out at 100
feet in the north drive from end of tunnel, and widening in the south drive to 21
feet at 150 feet from tunnel, where it abruptly stopped as if faulted.
The foot-wall of this part of the lode is soft, dark slate, and the eastern or hang-
ing wall a fine hard silicious quartzite, apparently also calcareous ; no diorite appears
in this level, and the lode at its thickest portion is a solid mass of yellow ore.
Winzes sunk from the north and south drives passed through and away from the
ore, which has probably gone eastward on its underlay. The diagrams (Figs. 60, 61,
and 62) show the mode of occurrence of the ore.
The prospects of this mine may now be regarded as promising, there being a large
amount of ore in sight, both in the newly opened and in the old workings ; the
general indications are in favor of its further improvement at depth, and if the
company succeed in getting a tramway to the railway line, and can utilize the
lignite deposits of the La Trobe valley for smelting purposes, the probabilities of
success will be greatly enhanced.
Remarks on Prospecting, etc.
In offering suggestions for the further prospecting of this portion of Gippsland
it must be pointed out that, as regards shallow alluvial workings, the best and most
extensive have already been found and worked out, and any future alluvial dis-
coveries sufficient to benefit a large number cannot reasonably be expected, though
there is still hope for small parties to prospect with a fair chance of success.
Whether undertaken at Government expense or by private enterprise, prospecting
operations require to be more directed to specialities than they have been hitherto.






Taking into consideration the fact that the gold in quartz reefs occurs in shoots,
with frequently long barren intervals between, it is easy to understand that, of
several gullies or creeks crossing a line of reef, one only may have cut through the
portion containing a shoot, and therefore the non-discovery of gold in one should
not be a discouragement to prospecting others. Certain lines of reef have been
proved auriferous at various points, and taking such lines as guides, the creeks and
gullies intersecting them should be systematically tested a short distance below.
The discovery of alluvial gold would thus be likely to lead to that of the matrix
whence it was derived; and in cases where alluvial gold occurs I would strongly urge
the advisability of careful search for the reef or lode, which is nearly certain to out-
crop near where the gold commences.
Generally the discovery of alluvial gold has led to that of the reefs ; there have
been cases in which the former was inferior and the latter very rich, and vice versa.
Such instances can be accounted for by the position and trend of creeks, gullies, or
leads, with respect to lines of quartz reef, and the position and extent therein of
the auriferous shoots.
The line of country between the Donnelly’s Creek reefs and the Boy’s Reef, and
the extension of that line south-easterly to the low country and north-westerly to
the Main Divide, should be prospected in the manner suggested. It is worthy of
note that the Royal Standard Reef, on Stander’s Creek, just outside the western
boundary of the sheet, is approximately in the line of strike of the Donnelly’s Creek
reefs. The line of the Walhalla belt and its extensions north-westerly and south-
easterly should also be prospected in a similar way.
As before indicated, the country eastward of the Donnelly’s Creek belt of reefs
may be one of those barren tracts in which gold does not occur; but this cannot be
proved except by proper trial. The country on the fall from the Mount Useful
Range into the Macallister has been, to all appearance, very little tested. Gold is
said to have been found in the Serpentine Creek and the western branch of the
Barkly, but the few holes I saw in those creeks were a very insufficient test. The
Glenmaggie Creek and its many branches hardly appear to have been tried at all.
The southern portion of the sheet, from the Macallister to the Thomson, presents
all the usual geological indications of being auriferous, and is almost untouched by
prospectors. The gravels beneath the basalt of Fullarton’s Hill and Connor’s Plain
are similar to those of the Dargo High Plains, and are worthy of a trial. The heavy
gravels underlying the basalt at the head of Cooper’s Ci’eek, west of the Thomson,
should be tested, as the currents which deposited them evidently crossed the
country containing auriferous belts.
The country occupied by Devonian rocks, eastward from the Barkly and
Macallister, cannot be recommended as likely to be auriferous, though a small
expenditure to test whether gold does or does not exist in that formation would be
advisable.
Besides the mines in work there is a wide field for enterprise in the numerous
reefs once proved auriferous, but at present lying untouched.
The usual story attached to these reefs, among which are the Happy-go-Lucky,
the Girl’s Beef, the Dream, the Mountaineer, and the Stratford and Avon, is that
good stone was found at the surface or for some distance down, and that it ran out
or was cut off by a fault, or the owners had not sufficient capital. The abandon-
ment of the reefs, being a good reason for regarding them as worthless, deterred


others from venturing time or money on them. It seems a very unlikely thing that
a shoot of auriferous stone should be absolutely solitary ; that where the track of a
lode continues after the stone has run out, there should be no more “ makes ” of
stone either at a depth or along the line of reef ; at any rate this is not the
experience obtained in most energetically worked and well developed mines.
Failing, therefore, the discovery of fresh lines of reef, there is good reason for the
opinion that those partly worked and now idle would, if their development was
proceeded with in an intelligent manner, again produce remunerative yields. Every
lode or vein has its peculiar features, and it is only by careful study thereof that
the miner can direct his operations so as to have a fair chance of success.
The general appearance of the reefs of this district is greatly in favor of the
theory that the veins of quartz and its contained metals and minerals were
segregated from the surrounding rocks into fissures and cracks ; where these fissures
follow the strike and bedding of the strata, they would naturally be expected to be
more persistent than where they cross them, and general experience bears out this
opinion. The laminated character of the Silurian rocks admits of fissures of great
length occurring along the strike of the uptilted beds. In the Devonian rocks,
whore the strata are less fissile, and also, from their more horizontal character, less
liable to be fissured, quartz occurs in small irregular veins, and occasionally large
bunches, one of which, in the Avon River, is 20 feet in thickness. Flat lenticular
veins occur isolated in some of the sandstones. The occurrence in these rocks of
quartz veins in cracks and joints of conglomerates containing quartz pebbles
shows that the formation of quartz veins is not confined to the Silurian rocks.
Where quartz veins accompany dykes in the Walhalla and Aberfeldy district, the
evidence is invariably to the effect that the igneous dyke-stone was injected into
the fissures first, and the quartz veins formed afterwards. In the Walhalla and
Donnelly’s Creek mines the laminated quartz is usually the richest in gold and
minerals. May not the laminated structure betoken a slow process of formation of
the quartz, and consequently more opportunity for the segregation of the rarer
minerals ?
In Mr. J. Cosmo Newbery’s laboratory report (Progress Report No. IY.), he
mentions the action of acid carbonate of ammonia on silica, and the progress of his
experiments in that direction may throw great light on the question of the chemical
conditions under which quartz veins were formed and the associated minerals
deposited.

NOTES ON THE AURIFEROUS LEADS OF MIDDLE PLIOCENE AGE
ON THE CRESWICK GOLDFIELD.
Supplementary to the report already furnished on the general geological conditions
of the country in the neighborhood of the Creswick goldfield, it is proposed to give
in the following paper an account of the drainage system of Middle Pliocene age,
as far as it has been disclosed by the operations of the miner, with the addition
of some speculative observations on its probable extension and trend. For the
proper understanding of the physical description herein given it will be of assistance
to refer to the geological map of the district, forwarded to the Office of Mines in
March last.
The order of the leads enumerated below is taken by commencing on the west
boundary of the survey (long. 143° 50'), and proceeding in an easterly direction to
the east boundary of the sheet (long. 144°).
1. The Sulky Gully Lead takes its rise on the south, or seaward, side of the
Main Dividing Range, crosses the latter after a north-westerly course of a little
over a mile, and, assuming a westward direction, passes under the basalt near the
Bible Christian Church. Only one shaft, 130 feet deep, has been sunk through
the basalt. The lead then resumes its north-westerly course between the main range
on the west and Sulky Gully on the east, and trends towards a probable junction
with the Bald Hill Lead, immediately north of Mount Hollowback.
On its whole course, so far described, this lead runs parallel with, and nowhere
more than a mile from, the Main Dividing Range. From Mount Pisgal westward
this range consists of a series of volcanic points of eruption which have greatly
modified the former surface configuration. The pre-Pliocene axis seems to have
been considerably to the south, deviating from the present watershed at a point
near the head of Petticoat Creek {vide Ballarat geological sheet), running first nearly
west by Mount Rowan, then west-north-westerly to the site of Lake Learmonth,
and thence to the granite range north of Ercildoun.
2. The Bald Hill Lead comprises several arms which spring in the Silurian
ranges west and south-west of Fiddler’s Gully. These ranges are abundantly
traversed by reefs and veins of quartz, and in one or two places capped by thin
layers of richly auriferous gravel, probably the redistributed remnants of Lower
Pliocene (the oldest) drift. The different branches unite west of the Bald Hill
schoolhouse, and the main lead has been worked thence westward to Sulky Gully.
The gutter, which has been in parts extremely rich in nuggety gold, lies from 135
to 160 feet under the basaltic plateau. Several broad quartz reefs, from which
auriferous specimens were freely obtained, intersect the bed of the lead channel on
the last 500 yards of its worked course, and it may be fairly assumed tend to
contribute towards the productiveness of the gutter drift for some further distance
west. Owing principally, it is stated, to the costly labor of subduing a consider-
able influx of mine water, operations on this lead have not been carried on for more
than 60 chains from the point of immergence under the basalt.
From the banks of the Sulky Gully the country to the north-west presents for
Many miles an unbroken sheet of lava, offering no features to indicate the position
of the lead beneath it, to ascertain which must therefore be left to actual boring or
sinking.


3. The Cobbler's and Diamond Gully leads. —The country drained by these
leads and their numerous affluents is situate from one to two miles south-west of the
township of Creswick, and consists of high Silurian ranges rather deficient in quartz
veins. The courses of the leads are often identical with those of the modern
valleys which frequently cut through and for considerable distances entirely
supplant them. Below the junction of the two branches the main lead enters
under the basalt west of Shicer Hill, and is again effaced by the broad valley of
Creswick Creek. After uniting with the Long Point Lead it is traced under the
basalt on the right bank of Creswick Creek, a short distance below Long Point.
The course of the gutter thence is probably north-easterly towards the Bed
Streak Lead.
4. The Red Gully Lead has its source at the northern base of the Snake Hill
ridge, and passing by the Hard Hill it is worked opposite Clarke’s Hill under the
name of White Flat Lead. The sinking is from 20 to 40 feet through clay and
gravel, and the material of the gutter, being chiefly derived from the contiguous
Lower Pliocene hills, is a well-rounded quartz boulder drift. It then receives the
Pollard Gully Lead, and enters the basalt south-east of Union Hill. Thence it
runs under the latter, crosses the Creswick Creek, and joins the Black Lead at the
Quarry Hill.
5. The Nuggety Gully Lead receives its auriferous gravels principally from
Dutchman’s Hill, Church Hill, and Hard Hill, and joins the Creswick Lead
immediately east of the railway station in the township of Creswick.
6. The Creswick Lead. —This lead has been traced from the Dividing Range,
where its sources are covered by the lava flow from Wombat Hill, Bungaree ( vide
Ballarat sheet), in a north-westerly direction for a distance of eight and a half miles.
It evidently formed, in Middle Pliocene times, one of the main drainage channels, in
the same way as the Creswick Creek of to-day is the principal watercourse of an
extensive district. On the first four or five miles of its course the lead, greatly
denuded and frequently cut through by the modern streams, runs generally
within a few hundred feet of the banks of the Slaty Creek. Receiving the
Long Gully Lead on the right, and the Milkman’s Flat Lead on the left,
it is capped at the Cabbage-tree Hill by a small outlier of basalt, and then
sinks beneath the alluvial flat of Slaty Creek, under which it runs as far as
Portuguese Flat, where it is joined by the Lincoln Lead. Passing in a straight
north-westerly course of over a mile in length through the township it enters
the basalt (under the name of Black Lead) at the base of Clarke’s Hill, crosses
the Creswick Creek some 130 yards above the railway viaduct, runs in a
westerly course beneath the Slaughteryard Hill, then northward under Quarry
Hill, and has been worked as the Red Streak Lead for upwards of a mile further
north. A great deal of prospecting has been conducted to define the lead north of
the Australasia Company’s ground, and a series of bores have proved pretty con-
clusively that its position may be looked for some 150 yards west of the Consols
No. 1 shaft, and an equal distance east of No. 2 shaft. The Cosmopolitan Com-
pany worked a tributary gutter (possibly the Long Point Lead) trending in a
north-easterly direction towards a junction with the main lead, probably some 20
chains due north of the Consols No. 2 shaft. Beyond this point there is little
guidance for further conjecture. It is generally accepted that the lead persists in
its northerly course across the Glendonald Creek, half a mile west of the Green


Hill, and seeks a confluence with the Spring Hill Lead west of Wheeler’s Bridge.
Mr. Patterson, the late manager of the Cosmopolitan Company, who, from his
observations at the most advanced point of the search operations has had the best
opportunity of acquiring a clear perception of the surrounding features, is of
opinion that the course of the gutter is a north-easterly one, leaving the Green Hill
some hundreds of yards to the west. This is, comparatively speaking, a matter of
detail, and its determination must be simply and solely left to the results of actual
sinking. Before leaving this subject it is, however, well to mention one circum-
stance which has been hitherto altogether overlooked. From the western margin
of the basalt, near the crossing of the Clunes road, a narrow belt of Upper Pliocene
clay drift, betwixt smooth Silurian hills, stretches westward along the Glendouald
Creek to the Creswick Creek. It is of considerable importance to know the depth
of this deposit, for under the present uncertainty there is no gainsaying the sup-
position that the Australasian Lead may follow the course of the Glendonald Creek
to its confluence with the Creswick Creek, and re-enter the basalt under the Race-
course Reserve. About three-quarters of a mile south of this point it has been
ascertained by sinking that a wet lead, 120 feet deep, underlies the alluvial flat of
the Creswick Creek. Owing to the narrowness of the Upper Pliocene deposit,
immediately west of the Clunes road, it is possible that a single bore may suffice
to determine its thickness ; and, considering the importance of the problem, it is
desirable that this work should he done in order to remove all doubts as to the
direction of the main trunk lead.
7. Doctor’s Lead. —The tongue of lava occupying the ridge which divides the
Adekate Creek from the southern arm of the Back Creek no doubt covers, together
with the two narrow basaltic outliers west of the first-named stream, an old lead
valley, the existence of which has so far escaped the attention of the miner. Where
the valley of the Adekate Creek and that of another watercourse, some 20 chains
to the west, have cut through the basalt specks of drift gold and washed quartz
pebbles have been unearthed by the ploughshare. The basalt terminates about a
Sketch-section showing probable eastern extension of Doctor’s Lead.
mile below the junction of the Adekate and Back creeks, and immediately to the
west of it extensive goldworkings have laid bare the rich gutter drift of Doctor’s
Lead. The latter follows the southern hank of Back Creek, and, receiving on the
north a tributary from Jackass Gully, has been worked uninterruptedly for a distance
of somewhat over a mile to Lincoln Bridge, where its course is cut through hy the
Lincoln Gully. At this point a small portion of the lead, about 200 feet in length,
still remains on the west bank of Lincoln Gully, just above its confluence with the
Back Creek, after which it has been for a considerable extent entirely removed by
the erosion of the present valley of Back Creek, in the sides and bed of which the
Palaeozoic rocks are everywhere exposed. At a distance of a little over half a mile
L


below Lincoln Bridge the lead drift re-appears in the left bank of the creek, and
has been wrought thence under the name of George’s Diggings, as far as
Portuguese Flat, where it unites with the Lincoln Lead, and finally joins the
Creswick Lead.
8. Spring Gully Lead. —This lead, under the name of Bed Lead, takes its rise
in many tributaries under the basalt on the southern slope of Spring Hill, and
follows the valley of Spring Gully, gradually rising to an elevation of from 40 to
60 feet above the present creek bed. It receives the Surface Gully, Sawpit Gully,
and Watson’s Gully Lead on the left, while the southern declivity of the Silurian
range on the right is now entirely denuded of any older drift which may have pre-
viously existed. On its lower course the lead becomes more and more denuded, and
intersected by the modern valley; Shicer Hill, Turkey Hill, and Eastern Hill are
detached portions of this lead. A junction with the Creswick Lead no doubt
existed at one time, but it is now completely obliterated by modifications in the
surface form brought about by later denudation.
9. Separation Lead. —The two branches of this lead, the Frenchman’s and
Mosquito Gully leads, spring at the western slope of Quartz Hill, and follow closely
the course of the modern valleys to their junction, after which the main lead bears
somewhat north of the present gully. The sinking here is through from 80 to
90 feet of gravel and clay drift. After crossing the site of the Clunes road the
lead enters under the basalt, and joins the Black Lead at the Slaughteryard Hill,
some 200 yards north of the railway viaduct.
10. The Upper Pliocene area, lying between Broomfield and Frenchman’s gullies,
and extending from the foot of the Armagh Beef Hill westward for about a mile, covers
three or four flat leads which have been worked upon with varying results. The
sinking on the eastern or higher portion is quite dry, and through 80 to 90 feet of
sandy mottled clay with ironstone pebbles, over a bed two feet thick of auriferous
quartz gravel. Further west a layer of basalt intervenes between the upper clay
and the lead gravel ; the sinking exceeds 110 feet, and from the large amount of
water the ground is difficult to work, or at all events, conditions more adequate appli-
ances than those hitherto used in this particular locality. The mines here have ceased
to be in operation for more than 18 months without determining the downward course
of the main gutter. The various lead branches no doubt unite into one main arm
which, judging by the contour of the Silurian boundary, seems to bear first west-
ward as far as the visible margin of the basalt, and then north-westerly towards the
Consols Company’s ground, joining the Australasian Lead probably east of their
No. 2 shaft.
11. The Spring Hill Lead. —The source of this lead has been traced to the
north-west slope of Spring Hill. Its material in quartz and gold seems to have been
chiefly derived from the denuded caps of Armagh Beef and several quartz veins
known to traverse the bed-rock beneath the lava of Spring Hill. Several rich
feeders join the main lead from the Armagh Beef ridge. The first coming from the
northern slope of Quartz Hill joins the main lead in the Western Lewer’s Company’s
ground. The second descending in a rapidly-deepening course from the crown of
the Armagh Beef Hill is traced to its junction in Bobinson’s Freehold. A third
tributary, the Dan Eyan’s Lead, springs from the northern extension of the
Armagh Beef, and has its upper course denuded by the erosion of Broomfield Gully.
It unites with the main lead in the Baron Eothschild Company’s mine, close to its


southern boundary. Three or four branches worked by the Eyrie’s Freehold and
Carter’s Freehold companies join the main gutter in Cameron’s Freehold, but the
various points of coalescence have not yet been clearly defined. The German Gqjly
and Broomfield leads, after uniting in the Nelson Company’s ground, probably have
their junction with the trunk lead in Dyke’s Freehold. On the north boundary of
the Eyan’s Junction Company’s leasehold the basalt projects north-easterly some
distance up the valley of a shallow watercourse. This projection is no doubt
caused by the lava flowing into an existing embouchure , and it is probable that this
channel, running in a south-westerly direction, may unite with the trunk lead at or
near the south-west angle of the above company’s leasehold. This company’s
workings are up to the present time the most advanced on the Spring Hill Lead.
Beyond this point there are no artificial sections, and but few natural features to
assist in indicating the onward course of the gutter. It is, however, likely that the
Spring Hill Lead, joined by the De Murska Lead, will be found east of McDonald’s
Hill, and thence trend in a northerly direction under the plateau between the Toola-
roop and Middle creeks.
Most of the quartz veins in the upper watershed of the Spring Hill Lead are
cupriferous, and we find in consequence that fine, rolled grains of native copper are
rather abundantly distributed through the lead gravels. With the exception of
this and some titaniferous iron sand the Spring Hill and neighboring leads
present a singular paucity of mineral adjuncts. The gold is of superior fineness,
being generally over 23 carats; and in the Baron Eothschild mine it rises as high as
23 J carats, and brought 83s. per ounce in the market. The lead, as far as it has
been wrought, has been extremely productive, although the layer of pay-gravel is
confined within narrow banks. As an example of successful mining enterprise it
may be stated that the length of the lead in the Baron Eothschild Company’s lease-
hold is 1,400 feet, the whole of which was blocked-out in thirteen months, viz., from
May 1875 until the middle of June 1876. During this period the produce of gold
amounted to 14,387 oz. 10 dwt. 16 gr., realizing £57,175 Is. lid. ; out of which
£12,910 11s. Id. was expended in the purchase of engine and plant and the working
of the mine, while £38,550, or £6 Bs. 6d. per share was returned in dividends,
besides £5,714 10s. lOd. paid in royalty to the landowner.
The depth of the gutter under the basaltic plains increases from 120 feet at the
First Chance shaft (on the north-west slope of Spring Hill) to 270 feet at Dyke’s
Freehold. At the Baron Eothschild it is 181 feet; the section of the shaft, which
lies 100 feet west of the gutter, is as follows :

The gradient of the bottom of the lead becomes less rapid with the increasing
distance from the source. In the Cumming’s Freehold mine the bed of the gutter


has been levelled for a distance of 800 feet, and the fall observed is 20 inches in
100 feet, or 1 in 60. The banks of the lead are nearly throughout capped with
gravel drift (“ reef-wash ”) both older and newer than the lead gravels. An
example of the older drift has been given in a previous report as occurring in the
Carter’s Freehold mine. In the Baron Rothschild ground there is a reef-wash on
both sides of the gutter from 2 to 4 feet thick, extending in one place where a
prospecting drive was put in on the the east 130 feet from the lead channel.
Numerous trial washings were made from the deposit, but in no case was the yield
of gold sufficient to defray the working expenses, and the work, therefore, was not
persevered with. In the Ryrie’s Freehold shaft, which lies some 500 feet south
of the gutter, a non-productive reef-wash of considerable thickness was struck at
118 feet. In the Ryan’s Junction shaft, beneath 145 feet of basalt, a similar wash,
23 feet thick, occurs. It is a white quartz pebble drift, the finer particles angular,
the coarser sub-angular with a few rounded boulders up to 12 inches in diameter.
This drift is completely barren, and lies 113 feet above the bed of the gutter. In
the two last-mentioned instances there is little doubt that the gravel beds belong to
the oldest (Lower Pliocene) drift.
12. Lewer’s Lead. —The sources of this lead have been traced along the northern
slope of Spring Hill to within less than half a mile from its summit. Two branches,
sunk upon by the Westcott Freehold and Royal Mint companies, proved the depth
to be 115 and 100 feet respectively. The lead bears in a north-westerly course for
45 chains to Lewer’s Freehold No. 1 shaft, then northerly 65 chains to the west
boundary of Bunyan’s Freehold, and finally north-east 30 chains to its confluence
with the Hawkins Lead, some 240 yards north-west of the Kingston Park shaft—
making the total length of this lead one and three-quarter miles. The fall of the
gutter bed on the first 92 chains is nearly the same as that of the present surface, the
average depth of sinking being 110 feet. The lead channel on this distance is from
20 to 30 feet wide, confined within steep walls, and holds a thickness of from 4to 7
feet of auriferous gravel. At the Richardson’s Junction mine, the lower half of the
gravel stratum is cemented. At a distance of 250 feet north of this company’s shaft
the bed of the gutter begins to fall rapidly at the rate of 3 feet in 100. A black clay
overlies the drift, which changes its former appearance of a clean white quartz
gravel to a dark-colored compound of quartz and black sandy clay, while the lead
suddenly expands to a width of 150 feet. Simultaneously with these changes a
greatly increasing amount of drift-water was observed, while the productiveness of
the gravel diminished in a manner that it was considered expedient to abandon
the mine, leaving some portions of the gutter untouched. Subsequently the lead
was worked upwards by the Kingston Park and Bunyan’s Freehold companies.
The changes noticed in the Richardson’s Junction mine are probably due to the
couflux of one or more tributaries which, however, cannot command any great
watershed. At the confluence with Hawkins Lead the gutter is about 180 feet
deep, while the level of the surface differs but slightly from that of the Richardson
Junction shaft, where the depth of the gutter is 112 feet.
13. Hawkins Lead. —This lead is first met with on the north-east slope of
Spring Hill, at a depth of 120 feet, and trends in a direction slightly west of north
through the mines of the Costello Freehold and Leischman’s Reserve companies,
where it is joined on the left by a branch lead worked by the Sovereign Company.
The depth of sinking here is 108 feet. Continuing its northerly course the lead is


successfully wrought by the Clark’s, Hawkins, and Bunyan’s Freehold companies,
at depths varying from 130 to 185 feet below the surface ; after which it assumes
a north-west direction through the Kingston Park mine, where it absorbs the
Lewer’s Lead, and has recently been touched upon by the De Murska Company,
about 300 feet south-west of their shaft, the depth being 198 feet beneath the
basaltic plain. From here the lead probably trends north-westerly, south of Birch’s
Bald Hill, towards the Bullarook Creek, near Wheeler’s Bridge.
The lava covering this lead occurs in two sheets, the southern extent of which
Sketch-section showing occurrence of Lava Streams at Hawkins Lead.
has been ascertained in the several shafts as shown on the annexed section. The
gutter in the southern part of the Bunyan’s Freehold mine varies from 20 to 60
feet in width, and is bound within steep banks. The depth of washdirt is from
sto 8 feet. Near the north boundary of the freehold the width increases to aver
100 feet. Along the east side occurs a terrace on an average 7 feet above the
gutter, capped by an auriferous reef-wash, 2 feet thick, the working of which has
yielded satisfactory returns. On the west side numerous small tributary channels
join the main lead, but the gold they contain proved insufficient to pay working
expenses. In the Kingston Park mine the eastern bank of the gutter is generally
steep and bare, while on the flat western bank rests a gravel capping 20 to 30
inches thick, with a lateral extent of upwards of 200 feet. This reef-wash is not
remuneratively auriferous. The width of the gutter in this mine averages 100 feet,
and varies from 70 to 200 feet. In the De Murska mine a similar reef-wash, 2to 3
feet in thickness, occurs at a depth of 163 feet in the shaft, and is again met with
at a distance of 220 feet south of the shaft, at a 36-feet lower level, whence it has
been followed for 180 feet westward. Gold has been freely observed throughout,
but as the mine is not yet in a sufficiently advanced condition an estimate of the
value of this deposit would be premature.
14. The existence of a deep channel has recently been established by the Bank
of England Company’s shaft, sunk on the south-east slope of Spring Hill. There
is a probability that this lead will bear northerly for about a mile in the direction

valley of the Bullarook Greek, a boro was sunk in the year 1865, of which Mr. Gore

Four specks of gold were obtained out of the bore-meal, from the lower gravel
drift. The flow of water was very strong, and rose with a considerable pressure
several feet above the natural surface. The cost of the work was £4OO.
The banks of the creek are from 80 to 100 feet above the surface of the bore ;
the thickness of basalt, therefore, cannot be less than 300 feet at this place.
It is generally assumed that the deep ground discovered here is a continuation of
the Rocky Lead. The Geological Survey not [having extended to that locality,
there are no present means of examining into the correctness of this view.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF LEARMONTH.
There is a probability that the leads of the City of Ballarat and Great North-
West companies may trend north-westerly, and nearly follow the course of the

Burrumbeet Creek, through the southern portion of the sheet ; thence passing
southerly towards Lake Burrumbeet and Carngham, where an accession of gold
would be obtained from the Silurian ranges passed through in that locality. The
Burrumbeet Creek is about 250 feet below the level of the top of the City of
Ballarat Company’s shaft. This is, I believe, about 400 feet deep, leaving 150
feet to reach the bottom, which, in the absence of true levels, is very nearly the
depth of Mr. Bath’s bores. The lead would most likely be found a little to the north
of these bores. Tributaries would come in from the north and east, but the former
would not be auriferous, for the whole country in that direction below the basalt
must be granite, as proved by the ejected masses of granite on all the volcanic
points of eruption as far east as Mounts Cavern and Blowhard.

REPORT ON SPECIMENS Nos. 4637, 4629 (4).
Since my report on the Learmonth specimens Mr. Ulrich has made a micro-
scopic examination of thin sections of the above numbers, and has given me the
following description :
No. 4637 (R. 23), black dense basalt of rather dull aspect, rendered porphyritic
by opaque regular and irregular crystalline grains of felspar, a few glassy quartz
grains, and greenish grains of olivine. The reactions of the rock, when examined
under the microscope, prove it to consist mainly of an isotropic brown glass base,
in part dentrified, and full of microlites of plagioclase, small grains of olivine, and
crystals of magnetite (titaniferous iron ?), showing in arrangement fluidal structure.
The glassy particles porphyritically distributed prove to be quartz ; the opaque
(felspathic) have an entire absence of twin striations and colored bands in polarized
light, which points to their belonging to a monoclinic or orthoclastic system ; and
this result is confirmed by an examination of the mineral by flame reactions, accord-
ing to the method of Professor Szabo, which unmistakably proves it to be potash
felspar, either orthoclase or sanidine : its opaqueness and general aspect point to
the former. As orthoclastic felspar is extremely rare in basalt, and when found
has been identified as sanidine, the occurrence of true orthoclase in this instance
M


must appear more strange and interesting ; but, considering that Mr. Norman
Taylor states in his report that this basalt comes from a point of eruption which
has broken through a deposit of granite detritus, and taking this into consideration
with the association of the felspar with quartz grains, the probability is that both
were taken up by the fluid lava on its passage through the detritus, though their
uniform porphyritic distribution would remain an unexplained and very curious
fact.
No. 4629 ( 4 ) (R. 17), light bluish-grey anamesite, rendered slightly porphyritic
by irregular colorless transparent patches of striated felspar and of yellowish-green
olivine. The rock inclines in aspect more to the trachytic than the basaltic series.
An examination of thin sections by the microscope proves the felspar to be, without
exception, plagioclase, and that there is a great deal of isotropic clear glass base
present in larger or smaller portions of irregular outline between the crystalline
minerals. Olivine is present in quantity, occasionally in nearly perfect, though
much fractured, crystals ; magnetite, or titaniferous iron, sometimes in octahedral
crystals, but mostly of irregular outline; augite very scarce, in light-brown
irregular crystals ; an examination by flame reactions proved the felspar to bo
labradorite.

REPORT ON AN OUTCROP OF GRANITE, EAST OF BUNINYONG.
Sir,
In accordance with your instructions, received on the 31st March, to follow out
the granite boundary at Buninyong in its continuation eastwards from Mr.
Murray’s Ballarat goldfield map, I proceeded to Yendon (late Buninyong East) on
the sth April, and commenced the work. I soon saw the impossibility of making
anything like a sketch-map of the country on the half-inch to a mile scale, on
account of two or three surveys not appearing on the county map, and the country
itself being of too complicated a character to record any facts worth observing on
so small a scale; I accordingly did the geological work on the two inches to a mile
scale, after obtaining all the requisite surveys from the Ballarat Survey Office,
omitting, as I at the time informed you, all mere topographical work not absolutely
necessary to the correct delineation of the boundaries of the rock masses themselves.
The time of the year selected for working in a wet district like Buninyong was
unfortunate, as it has been almost incessantly wet, and the country flooded. The
field work was finished on Ist June, and the remaining time has been occupied in
plotting it.
I have now the honor to forward the finished plan with indices to the notes not
on the map, and the few rock specimens collected. As I was not informed for
what purpose this work was intended, I am rather at a loss as to what is required
to be reported upon, or if, indeed, any report is needed. A few observations, how-
ever, in addition to the facts shown on the map may not be out of place.
The granite appears to have occupied a large basin in the Silurian rocks, formed
by the prolongation of the Buninyong and Clarendon ranges on the west and
south-west, and the Mount Egerton ranges—through which Ben’s or Woolan Creek


and the Moorabool River have cut their way —on the east. This lower (in regard
to the Silurian) granitic area was subsequently overflowed by lava streams, some of
which apparently have not taken the lowest levels. This is to be accounted for by
the granite—which now remains uncovered, and was, at the time of the flow, at a
higher level—having, from its easy decomposibility, suffered greater denudation
than the harder basalt, and been reduced to a lower level. Some of the present
exposed granite areas have no doubt also once been covered by the basalt (as proved
by several outliers), which has since been entirely swept away. The area of granite
shown on the map is evidently a part of the same mass as that at the Gong Gong
reservoir, being merely separated from it superficially by the basalt overflows from
Mount Warrenheip to the north-west. Some further extension of the granite may
possibly occur farther north, towards Bungaree and the Great Dividing Range.
The granite boundary on the north flank of the range to the south-west is quite
an arbitrary one, having been only approximately determined by the contour of the
Silurian hills. With the exception of the two spots marked “granite” on the map,
there is no other sign of it in its massive state, the surface drift being the only
indication of its presence, and that consisting more of a reef detritus than of a
granitic one. No granite is visible east of Smith’s Hill. The surface on the flanks
of this basaltic hill is covered with blocks of hard ferruginous grit and silicious
cement, and it is most likely that the flow does not end abruptly, as shown by
Mr. Murray, but that it underlies this Tertiary deposit, outcrops again in Tendon,
and thence flows down and under the large Tertiary flats to a junction with the
south-east flow from Mount Warrenheip, which has caused the sudden right-angular
bend of the Lai Lai Creek. I believe that the area which I have colored as granite
and dotted with Tertiary, in the south-west corner of the township of Tendon (to
assimilate it with Mr. Murray’s sheet) would be found to be, were there any
wells to show it, basalt overlaid by drift. The same holds with the south-east
foot of Smith’s Hill in Mr. Murray’s sheet. In all the remaining portions of the
district the granite is well developed, forming either low or tolerably high ranges
among the basalt flows. The granite boundary along the courses of the Moorabool
River, and the Black and Ben’s creeks is much obscured by the talus from the
basalt escarpments. Here and there, on the Black Creek especially, landslips have
exposed the underlying granite. The banks of these two creeks, which stretch
backwards on the eastern in a long—but on the western sides in a steep—slope
to the basalt plains, are covered by drift sand, utterly destroying any evidence
of what lies below. This has been caused by the sudden turn of the river to the
south, and the consequent rush of water against the eastern banks, during the
first period of its channel-cutting.
Little need be said about the basalt flows, the courses of which will be seen on
the map. They have their source in Mount Warrenheip and the Black and Green
Hills. I believe that the basalt fills the valley running south-east from Tendon,
and now covered by Upper Pliocene deposits, up to or near the boundary of the
latter, as shown on the map, and of course overlying the granite. The height of
the plains at the junction of the Lai Lai Creek and the Moorabool River is about
250 feet above the bed of the river, and between this and the Moorabool Falls, and
below the smaller granite falls, it is possible that the basalt crosses the river; but
the precipices are so abrupt that I was unable to determine the question. The
height of the Lai Lai Falls is 110 feet, to which must be added about 30 feet


above them to the top of the cliff. The bottom of the basalt is not visible under
the falls, and from this great thickness of lava it is hardly probable that it ends so
abruptly as it appears to do. It must underlie the swamps and flats towards Lai
Lai, but any evidence in that direction I could not obtain.
In Mr. Ulrich’s Descriptive Catalogue of the Rocks of Victoria, 1875, p. 106,
the Lai Lai lignite is described as being 115 feet thick, above which is about
73 feet of alternating sand, clay, and gravel (the lower three feet fire-clay).
In the Descriptive Catalogue of Rocks, &c., in the Mining Department, 1875,
p. 67., the lignite shaft is described as being sunk 200 feet—6o feet surface (what,
is not mentioned), 128 feet of lignite, 5 feet of clay, 8 feet of lignite, and another
seam below, unprospected.
In Mr. Selwyn’s Exhibition Essay, p. 79, the lignite is stated by Mr. Ulrich to
occur “in the Miocene Tertiary formation of Lai Lai,” his opinion being based
apparently on the occurrence of conifer®, but their age has not as yet, I believe,
been decided.
In none of these instances is there any mention of a bottom rock; and I could
obtain no information on the spot, as the works were closed, and the shaft half full
of water, with only a man in charge.
Now, considering that the basalt at the falls is of the thickness stated, and appa-
rently flowing southerly, as indicated by the fall of the country, and nothing but
a level swampy country intervenes between it and Lai Lai, what has become of
this basalt flow, and also of that coming down the valley from Tendon ? They
could hardly dip rapidly enough (it would require, by calculation, a fall of 94 feet
in a mile) in so short a distance as to underlie the lignite; and if they did, and
supposing the flows to be newer basalt, then the lignite cannot be Miocene.
In the geological sketch-maps of the colony by Mr. Selwyn and Mr. Smyth the
basalt is shown all round Lai Lai and for some distance to the south. In Mr.
Selwyn’s sketch-section he says;—“Near Lai Lai Falls the Tertiary sands are
at the surface. Several shafts have been gunk through sand and clay and
through a bed of lignite 120 feet thick. Gold-bearing drifts would very likely be
found under the lignite in this basin. * * * * The age of the lignite is at
present (1866) uncertain; if Miocene, and the same age as the ‘ Golden River’s’
basin, gold deposits will not probably underlie it.”
Under the circumstances it seems more than probable that the Tendon and south-
east Warrenheip flows, becoming narrowed to about a mile in width, have turned
north-easterly, and crossing between the two falls have turned easterly, and
gradually round to the south, after joining other flows from the north-west, and then
down the east side of the Moorabool Valley. The apparent fall from north to south
between the Moorabool and Lai Lai falls is probably due to the scour of the Lai Lai
Creek while cutting its passage. At note 14 is probably the outlet of the underlying
lead, and notes 12 and 18 are possibly portions of the same.
The depth of the sinking at Lai Lai still requires explanation, and if the above
solution of the course of the basalt flow be the correct one, there must be a sand-
stone bar or ridge running across between the basalt and the basin containing the
lignite.
The elevation of the basalt plains above the river and creeks to the east is about
150 feet in their upper, and from 250 feet to 300 feet in the lower part of their
course.


The drifts colored yellow on the map may very likely require modification.
Those round Yendon are at a slightly higher elevation than the Newer Pliocene
down the valley, but otherwise there is nothing to show their relation to the other
rocks. In other places to the north where they occur, they persistently follow the
basalt edge and have the appearance of underlying it. Those at notes 14 and 18
on the map —one of which is cut through by a road—l think will certainly be found
to underlie the basalt.
Some leads must certainly occur under the basalt flows, fed on the one side by
the Ballarat ranges, and on the other by the Egerton and Gordon ranges. A very
likely-looking surface wash of rounded quartz pebbles occurs at Note 40. A deep
lead probably crosses Ben’s Creek in the narrow gap of 15 chains between the out-
crop of Silurian, and another may pass under the narrow strip of basalt near note 45.
The whole of the land, however, is purchased property.
The large round swamps about Lai Lai are surrounded by sand ridges, generally
covered with brake-fern and present a very coast-like appearance.
In conclusion, I may state that the greater part of the boundaries had to be
traversed on account of a large portion of the country being held by Messrs. Fiskin
and Bacchus in large blocks, and none of the survey lines being fenced.
I have the honor to be. Sir,
Your most obedient servant,

REPORT.
On the 20th October 1876 I sent in my report of progress for the year ending
the 30th September 1876. I was then engaged in finishing the field work of the
Learmonth sheet. On the 24th February 1877 I finished and sent in the map of
that sheet with some additional remarks, the report having been previously sent
down for publication in conjunction with the progress report. On the 26th February
I forwarded a collection of rocks and minerals, with full descriptive indices ; and


on the 27th commenced plotting the Clunes sheet, which I had been instructed to
survey geologically. On the 31st March I received a letter with instructions to
survey the granite boundary in the neighborhood of Buninyong East (Yendon),
and on the sth April I proceeded to Yendon to carry out these instructions. On
the 2nd June I had finished the field work there, and on the 4th July sent down
the map and report. On the 16th and 17th July I was occupied in moving to
Clunes, since which time I have been partly engaged in continuing the plotting of
the Clunes sheet, which has been a work of considerable difficulty, as, owing to the
very insufficient data at my command, I had in many instances to examine the
surveys on the ground ; and have finished the field work of about one-sixth of the
area of the sheet (84 - 267 square miles).
It would be useless for me to attempt to report upon a district of which, at pre-
sent, I know so little, and have been for so short a time engaged upon ; but I think
it is highly probable that the survey here will throw a good deal of light upon the
trend of the deep leads, about which there is much speculation. That they are
continuations of the Creswick leads I have little doubt, although the general opinion
here is that they are entirely local. The very much rounded or waterworn character
of the quartz, however, precludes the latter idea.
The lead worked in the New Lothair Company’s Lease has been long since
abandoned, and the only workings now are almost too poor to be continued with any
profitable result, averaging only from | dwt. to 1 dwt. per load. The lead is sup-
posed to come from the north-west, as the Theodora Company, 13 chains north-west
of the New Lothair shaft, reached bottom at 233 feet, while the latter company
bottomed at 242 feet, and the lead bottom, to the east of the shaft, is about 256
feet. If this should be the case, and it is the exact reverse of the trend of the
existing watercourses, it will be merely a tributary of the main leads from Cres-
wick, which must underlie the plains to the eastward. The lead is very flat and of
variable width, with a high bar on its eastern side. Nuggets of native copper and
concretionary masses of oxide of manganese occur, the latter in considerable quan-
tities, as also fine copper dust. I cannot help thinking that the above measurements
and levels are not reliable, and that, were an accurate survey made, it might be
found that the lead went in the contrary direction.
Another lead, with drift of the same character as the New Lothair, was touched
at 1,000 feet east of the old Oriental Company’s shaft, long since abandoned, under
about 170 feet of basalt.
The so-called leads in the pre-emptive section, or the “paddock,” are merely
local reef-washes, old “ surfacing ” in fact, now covered by basalt.
The basalt, as taking the lowest levels, will, to some extent, indicate the course
of the leads, and until that boundary is accurately mapped it would be useless to
speculate on the subject. In some places where the basalt is narrowed to a width
of about half a mile, as between the cemetery and the pre-emptive right, and again
on the edge of the Mount Beckworth granite, it would be decidedly advantageous
to bore; but it would be extremely difficult and expensive to find (except acci-
dentally) the lead or leads which must underlie the widely extended basaltic plains
to the east of Clunes.
The reefs are all “ saddle reefs,” and the accompanying section, reduced from a
plan kindly lent by Mr. J. Bryant, the manager, shows their mode of occurrence in
the New Lothair Company’s mine. The reefs occur apparently along the cap of a




ridge forming an anticlinal axis, with a synclinal to the eastward, in which the deep
lead is shown. Further sections will be given in my full report on the sheet when
finished. Native copper (moss copper) occurs in the above-mentioned mine, and
much of the quartz is discolored by blue and green carbonates. Zinc blende, galena,
copper pyrites, and cubic and arsenical pyrites, occur sparingly.
The “ country consists generally of thin-bedded aluminous sandy beds with
cubic pyrites, shales, and mudstones, with occasional hard bands of slate and meta-
morphic schists.
No dykes occur in the reefs, either granitic (elvan) or basaltic (lava streak).

NOTES ON THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF DAYLESFORD.
PROGRESS OF SURVEY.
The area comprised within the survey is about 140 square miles. It lies to the
east of the 144th meridian, and includes the parishes of Bullarto and Wombat, and
a great portion of the parishes of Glenlyon, Holcombe, Franklin, Bullarook, and
Korweinguboora, in the counties of Talbot, Bourke, and Grant. Nearly one-half
of the area of the sheet is in unsurveyed country, and this is for the most part ex-
tremely rugged and thickly wooded. It would have been impracticable to carry on
the survey over so large a tract without the aid of some fixed lines as bases, and
to meet this deficiency I have provisionally surveyed somewhat over five miles of
connecting lines between Wombat and Bullarook. The survey is divided into two
parts : the northern half-sheet being at present in progress, and the skeleton map for
field purposes has been compiled. In addition to numerous traverse surveys and
preliminary examinations I have filled in the details of four square miles in the parish
of Bullarook, and fifteen square miles in the parishes of Wombat, Glenlyon, and
Bullarto. The latter area presents both geologically and topographically some of
the most intricate features lam acquainted with on any of the goldfields. Owing
to the natural obstacles offered in the ruggedness of the locality, and the difficulty
of obtaining precise and trustworthy information respecting important features un-
covered by former—now abandoned—mine operations, the progress of the survey
in the part completed has been necessarily slow. Less difficulty, at least with regard
to the last point, is anticipated in the future, as a mass of mining information has
been collected over a considerable portion of the sheet.
The rock formations represented in the area under survey are principally Lower
Silurian, Newer Volcanic, the Upper Tertiary gold drifts, and Post-Pliocene.
Palaeozoic Rocks.
It is apparent from the persistent westerly dip of the Lower Silurian rocks in
the country between the Loddon and Daylesford that the uppermost beds are ex-
hibited on or in proximity to the meridional range, of which Wombat Hill forms a
conspicuous point. The beds thence westward become considerably folded and


fractured (vide Fig. 1), and with them the principal auriferous quartz veins are
associated. The flags in these upper beds, consisting of light and dark grey, almost
black, shales, abound in graptolites (chiefly Graptolites fruticosus and Phyllograptus
folium ). The finely-granular, greyish-yellow, sandstone in the neighborhood of
Daylesford is being occasionally used as a building stone for rubble work. An
indurated sandstone, almost passing into quartzite, is met with near the basalt
boundary at Leitch’s Creek. On the left bank of the lower part of Wallaby Creek
occurs a coarse brown quartz grit (E 1), lithologically resembling the Tertiary con-
glomerates in other localities. The general strike of the beds in the latitude of
FIG. 1.

Wombat Hill is from 16° to 22° west of north, approaching further north more
and more to the magnetic meridian.
Quartz Veins.
The auriferous quartz veins on which mine work has been most extensively
carried on in this district occur in a belt, less than a mile wide, passing imme-
diately west of Wombat Hill, and have been thence traced, almost uninterruptedly,
for several miles both north and south. This group of veins lies in the flexured
beds at A, shown on Figure 1, and includes the Specimen Hill, Colliers, Sandstone,
Wombat Hill, Crown, Nuggety, Ajax, St. G-eorge, Eugenie, Hepburn, and Mauri-
tius reefs. Among them the most noteworthy, both from an economic and
scientific aspect, are the so-called “mullock loads,” i.e., bodies of slate in fractured
and contorted layers, with bands, veins, and lenticular masses of quartz, contained
within regular walls of the bounding slate and sandstone country. Reefs of this
character, opening out to a thickness of 30, 50, and even 100 feet, yielding more or
less productive stone, occur in the immediate neighborhood of Daylesford. The
Wombat Hill Reef (Cornish Lode, Red Lode, Mullock Reef, Black Lode) offers
many features of interest. The lode, from Bto 30 feet in thickness, underlying
W. 21° S. 62°, is in places a massive body of quartz, yielding as high as an ounce
of gold per ton, while in others the space between the walls is filled with an inde-
terminate mass of slate and quartz veins. At the 520 feet level in the Cornish
mine the lode terminates vertically against the bassets of the slate beds, the floor
thus formed dipping southward 22°. The walls of the lode still continue downwards,
as was ascertained by a cross-cut driven beneath the floor (vide Fig. 2). The
entire body of stone between the walls is treated under the mill, it having been found
that the free gold is contained chiefly, if not solely, in the slate, or possibly in the
pyrites with which the slate is thickly studded. The average yield of gold at this
spot is 3 dwt. per ton. The nature of the bordering rock plays here, as elsewhere,
an important part in the distribution of gold in the veinstone. Where the wall of
the vein and the bedding planes of the country are coalescent, a smooth black argil-
laceous band, or a layer of crystalline indurated sandstone (as shown in section)


encases the lode, and the stone in such parts is invariably poor. On the other
hand, where the angles of dip or strike of the vein are somewhat different to those
of the schist beds the faces of the lode are “ragged,” the casing is absent, and small

veins of quartz jut out from the main body and enter the country under various
angles. It is noticed, however, that these veins frequently present a regular
southerly dip, corresponding to that of the main shoot of quartz ; the miner speaks
of them as “ feeders,” and the occurrence is generally accompanied by an increased
richness of stone.
A singular feature is exhibited in the strike of the Wombat Hill Reef, opposite (east
of) the North Cornish Company’s shaft. The reef
in the Cornish Company’s mine bears 20° to 22°
west of north. The eastern wall still continues in
the same strike; so does the western wall after a
break of 40 to 50 feet, and the lode has thence
been worked as the Black Beef for over 200 yards
northward to beneath the basalt cover of Wombat
Hill. At the point where the break occurs in the
hanging wall a strong vein, defined but with less
distinct walls, branches off to the left under a
bearing of N. 36° W., and a westerly underlay of
75°. This lode is being worked under the name
of Roman Eagle Reef, at a distance of 370 yards
north of the point of divergence (Fig. 3).
Similar in character to the Wombat Hill Reef
is the Mauritius Reef, distant about a mile north-
west of Wombat Hill. This is a body from 2
to 12 feet in thickness of fractured dark-grey
slate, full of cubic pyrites, with numerous irregular

bands and veins of quartz, underlying 65° to 85° westerly. The western or
hanging wall is smooth and well defined, while the dead rock in the footwall
frequently encroaches upon the lode, pinching it into a narrow space of

only a few inches in thickness. The south level
in the Union Company’s adit exposes such a
contraction of the lode. The thickest part of the
lode in this place is 4 feet 4 inches, which serves
as a scale for the other dimensions in the annexed
section (Fig. 4). The whole mass of stone between
the walls is crushed, and yields from 3 to 7 dwt.
of gold per ton. The gold is always associated
with the mullock; it is never seen in the quartz,
neither in the bands and patches within the lode
walls, nor in the separate veins which are to be
found in close proximity. The Hepburn Reef, e.g.,
in the same mine, is a vein 55 feet west of the
Mauritius Reef, and a true quartz reef 12 to 30
inches thick; but although the adit opened out upon
it, the stone never yielded profitable returns, and the
workings were abandoned
Newer Volcanic.
The result of volcanic activity and subsequent extensive denudation is strikingly
exemplified in the Daylesford district. The principal points of eruption are
Wombat Hill, Fern Hill, Lightwood Hill, Snake Hill, Kangaroo Hill (Glenlyon),
Bald Hill, and Mount Franklin, lying to the east of Deep Creek ; and Kangaroo
Hill (Bullarook), Eastern Hill, Mount Bullarook, and Smeaton Hill, on the west.
The lava flow around the site of the township of Daylesford appears to have taken
place during two distinct periods. The older flow emanated from one or more
points north of Wombat Hill ; the latter and less wide-spread flow came from
Wombat Hill itself, and its border is well defined along a contour some 140 feet
below the crown of the hill. A thick deposit of ash and scoria;;, with grains of
obsidian, fills a great part of the depression between Wombat Hill and Fern Hill.
At Italian Hill a layer of greyish-white tuff occupies the lowest part of an old lead
valley. The cellular lava north of Wombat Hill is rich in carbonate of lime. The
basalt betw r een Daylesford and Glenlyon contains hornblende and large tabular
pieces of transparent oligoclase, with coatings of carbonate of iron and calcite ;
olivine is rare. The rock is coarsely-granular, and, although affording a good
road metal, is ill-adapted for dressing as a building stone.
Lower Pliocene (oldest drift).
Since the deposition of the Lower Pliocene gravels the physical aspect of the
country has been so thoroughly changed by powerful and protracted denudation
that the few remnants now represented in the vicinity of Daylesford do not offer
sufficient proof to show whether the oldest drift occupied at any time wide-spread
beds or not. At the Wallaby Diggings, two miles north-east of Daylesford, the drift


is clearly identifiable, occupying the crown of a
Silurian hill, flanked on two sides by a lava sheet,

The deposit is auriferous, and has been advan-
tageously worked upon.
Middle Pliocene (oldee drift).
The trend of the main channels of Middle Plio-
cene age, from the Dividing Range northwards,
shows on the whole but little divergence from
that of the modern drainage system. An ex-
ceptionally large deviation exists in the Wombat
Hill Lead, caused by the interposition of the lava
stream from Wombat Hill and neighboring points
of eruption. The course of this lead, once no
doubt the main arm of the River Loddon, runs
for a distance of seven miles in a north-easterly
direction, nearly under right angles to the present
valleys, before it assumes the northerly bearing
along the modern stream beyond the township of
Glenlyon. The lead takes its rise at an elevation
of 2,050 feet above sea-level, immediately south of
Wombat Hill, where it is covered by 110 feet of
lava. The original surface, west of Wombat Hill,
presents a narrow ridge running in a north-north-
westerly direction, and dividing the Wombat Hill
Lead from the Doctor’s Gully (Township) Lead
{vide Fig. 6). The gold in the lead drift is
evidently derived from the denuded caps of
several quartz veins which traverse the dividing
ridge, and have, subsequent to the discovery of
the leads, been mined upon. For a distance
of 300 yards the Wombat Hill Lead runs parallel
with this ridge, and then suddenly turns under
an elbow bend of 60° to the east, beneath the
crown of the hill, where the overlying mass
of volcanic rock cannot be less than 350 feet in
thickness. Just below (east of) the elbow a
dyke, some 50 feet thick, cuts across the lead

valley without affecting either the level or direction of the latter. Miners look
upon this as the pipe of the crater, but judging by the unaltered condition of the
original surface contiguous to the dyke, and from the character of the dyke stone,
resembling in places tuff rather than basalt, the probability is that it is a fissure
filled from above by the overspreading sheet of volcanic matter, while the vent of
the intrusive lava, lying some distance to the south-east, has never been touched

upon by the mine workings.
The lead channel, which is from
20 to 50 feet wide, falls rapidly
for a distance of a little over
a mile, when it opens out to
a width of over 100 feet, with
a decreasing gradient. At 250
yards below this point the lead
is joined on the left by the Con-
cordia gutter, a tributary which
bifurcates at a distance of 330
yards from the junction. Both
branches have proved exceed-
ingly rich in gold. The head of
the northern branch emerges
from under the edge of the
volcanic, on the south side of
Spring Creek, near its confluence
with Blind Creek. The southern
branch was worked to Blind
Creek ; and with the view of
tracing its supposed source west-
ward a series of costly shafts
were sunk through the basalt,
on the left side of the last-
named watercourse. The work,
although practically a failure, is
so far of interest, as it discloses the existence of a crater basin at a distance of half
a mile north of Wombat Hill. The position of this crater is approximately defined

bj the sinking of four or five shafts (vide Fig. 7).
The Golden Gate shaft was sunk 350 feet in dense
basalt without bottoming. The Garibaldi shaft
descended 200 feet, and drove south 200 feet against
the rock, sunk again 90 feet and drove 60 feet,
finally went down 12 feet, and discontinued at a
total depth of 302 feet (see Fig. 8). The Fountain
Head shaft was sunk to a depth of 400 feet, driving
at intervals westerly against the barrier of basalt. A
fourth shaft, sunk by the Great Extended Company
on the southern border of the basalt, bottomed at 200
feet, and then followed the wall-like, almost vertical, face of the rock downwards for
a considerable depth, with the same fruitless object of searching for a lead at a level


deeper, by several hundred feet, than any channel of Middle Pliocene age in the
neighborhood (Fig. 9). It was, on the contrary, apparent at the outset that the
inclination of the lead beds was away from the hill, as the sources of the Kidd’s
Gully Lead were traced in two branches under the basalt, the one to the Garibaldi
shaft, the other to the Golden Mount shaft (vide plan, Fig. 7). A similar feature,

well calculated to have served the local miner as a precedent, is presented by the
Township Lead, which, after a sub-basaltic course of half a mile, emerges at the
head of Doctor’s Gully, and follows the direction of the latter, where it is partly,
and in places wholly, removed by the erosion of the modern valley (Fig. 10).
FIG. 10.
Sketch longitudinal section of Township Lead.
Returning to the Wombat Hill Lead we find, at a distance of 700 yards below
the confluence of the Concordia Lead with the main channel, a branch falling in on
the right. This branch, known as the Dead Man’s Lead, has been traced from the
Astley No. 2 shaft southward for 1,200 feet. Many adverse opinions notwith-
standing, facts so far observed induce me to think that this is the Italian Hill
Lead; and, if so, there are fully 3,000 yards of workable gutter untouched, in addi-
tion to the tributary leads, which there is evidence to show must coalesce with it :
one coming from the head of Smith’s Creek, trending east towards the California
shaft, the other from the Copenhagen Company’s shaft, west of Lightwood Hill,
passing northward by the Florence Nightingale shaft. The search operations of
the Long Tunnel Company promise to remove some of the uncertainty at present
felt with regard to the older drainage system south-east and east of Daylesford.
In the neighborhood of the Astley No. 2 shaft the lead is 150 feet wide ; on the
next quarter of a mile the width is increased to upwards of 400 feet, accompanied
by a corresponding decrease in gold. It is at this distance that a junction of the
O’Hara Bourke Lead, probably running beneath the cemetery, may be looked for.
At the Astley No. 3 shaft the Pig-and-Whistle Lead, a narrow gutter with steep
gradients, joins on the right. This lead has been traced beneath a contracted


tongue of lava, about three-quarters of a mile, to its source, and is quite worked
out. Immediately above the Astley No. 3 shaft the main lead, under a lava
covering of 160 feet, spreads with a northerly sweep into a wide flat, extending
across the site of the Malmsbury road. The northern border of the drift has been
but imperfectly explored, and it is possible that this is an embouchure formed by the
Fern Hill Lead, the position of which has been ineffectually looked for some 25
chains further east. The head of the Fern Hill Lead protrudes from under the lava
at a spot three-quarters of a mile north of Fern Hill, and its course has thence been
followed for about 600 yards, the washing of the drift being hardly remunerative at
the farthest part worked. Between that point and the probable junction, a distance
of nearly a mile, two shafts (the Cosmopolitan No. 2 and the Newton No. 2 shafts)
have been sunk, bottoming at 150 and 137 feet respectively on bare bed-rock. As
already stated, the course of the gutter probably lies further west, perhaps from 10
to 25 chains.
At a distance of 4,600 yards from its source the Wombat Hill Lead arrives under
the eastern branch of Wallaby Creek, where it receives on the south a feeder which,
at 300 yards, splits up into two branches of but limited extent. The main lead
has not been traced beyond the Coomoora shaft, on the right bank of the Wallaby
Creek, but the boundaries of the old valley are pretty clearly defined by the, albeit
somewhat intricate, outlines of the lava sheet; and it seems surprising that so much
desultory work should have been done by miners, while even now opinions are still
far from settled. The approximate course of the lead may be gathered from the
following observations : —A shaft was started and abandoned by the Confluence
Company, 45 chains east of the Coomoora shaft, in a position well chosen to secure
the junction of the main and Great Eastern leads. The latter runs under the belt
of basalt on the left side of Leitch’s Creek coming from Lightwood Hill, and has
been worked principally by the Dajdesford Company. On the further side of the
Confluence shaft the main lead must pass by the shaft commenced by the Creavy
Company, on Leitch’s Creek. Somewhat less than half a mile further west the
Duke of Cornwall Company worked a gutter 200 to 400 feet wide. This is either
the main lead or the lower part of a tributary, starting west of Snake Hill from the
tongue of lava on the east side of Leitch’s Creek (opposite the Daylesford Com-
pany’s shaft), where the older drift is seen dipping -beneath the basalt. The trunk
lead then trends more northerly, towards the Lyon Bank Company’s shaft, whence
it resumes its north-easterly course, passes north of Kangaroo Hill to the township
of Glenlyon, crosses the Loddon below Babington’s homestead, and follows along
the course of the river, through Holcombe P. R. to Fryers {vide geological quarter
sheets 10 N.W. and 9 S.W.). From Glenlyon downwards the overlying basalt is
frequently cut through and exposes the lead, with a considerable depth of the
Silurian rock in natural sections.
The Wombat Hill Lead and its ramifications have been exceedingly rich in gold
at their upper courses. It has been estimated, for instance, that on the first
mile, viz., from the Haphazard to the White Star mines, the Wombat Hill Lead
has produced 170,000 oz. of gold, being equal to 32 oz. of gold for every lineal
foot of its course. With the paucity, however, of auriferous quartz veins, the
absence of oldest drift deposits in the drainage area beyond the Wallaby Creek
Lead, and the increasing width and depth of the drift over the expanding gutter
bed, the contents of gold declines pari passu. The material of the gutter drift is a


more or less well-rounded quartz gravel, with a shingle of sandstone, containing
fragments of wood and trunks of trees in various states of preservation, but nearly
always impregnated with, or wholly changed into, bi-sulphuret of iron. The over-
lying rock varies from a soft ash and tuff to scorite and dense basalt. Where the
Concordia Lead merges into the main channel, and for some distance below that
point, a layer of black clay and sandy mudshale intervenes between the gravel and
tuff. This layer is full of impressions of reeds and eucalypti leaves.
Upper Pliocene (recent drift).
As usual, in the neighborhood of volcanic centres, the greatest extent of the latest
Tertiary deposit occurs in places upon and around the basalt boundaries where the
clay drift fills up the inequalities in the surface caused by the lava flows. An
example has already been given ante, in the sketch section (Fig. 10) relating to the
Township Lead at the head of Doctor’s Gully, where the thickness of the recent
deposit is upwards of 100 feet.
In most of the watercourses which are scooped out on, or adjacent to, the sites
of Middle Pliocene leads we find Upper Pliocene “drift banks,” consisting in great
part of the re-distributed material of the denuded older drift. Red, brown, blue,
and mottled clays, with angular quartz fragments, form the matrix, with which are
mixed up well-worn pebbles and boulders of quartz, and shingle of slate and sand-
stone. In many places, notably at Sailor’s Creek and Stony Creek, where a layer
of lava has been intersected by later erosion, pebbles and larger masses of com-
pletely rounded basalt form a not inconsiderable adjunct in the drift (vide Fig. 11).
FIG. 11.
Sketch-section showing Pliocene Gold Drifts south-west of Daylesford.
At Leiteh’s Creek and other places, where denudation has removed the capping
of basalt either wholly or in part without interfering with the sub-lying bed-rock,
the flanks of the hills are frequently covered by a ferruginous precipitate in the
form of layers and nodules of brown iron ore. Fragments of this ore, either sub-
angular or in pisolitic pebbles, also occur to a limited extent distributed both as
“local” drift and as cappings in some of the swampy depressions between Wombat
Hill and Lightwood Hill.

REPORT ON THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF PORTIONS OF
DARGO AND BOGONG.
The area geologically illustrated by the accompanying sketch-map embraces the
lofty basaltic plateaux known as the Dargo and Bogong High Plains, to which
attention has been directed, not only on account of the scientific interest attached
to the geology of the country, hut also on account of the existence, beneath the
basalt of the plateaux, of auriferous gravels, the successful development of which
would largely augment the mining importance of the district.
Notes.
1.
This patch of basalt is apparently a vestige of
the western edge of a flow covering a lead from the
north now obliterated by denudation. See Note 2.
2.
In these two gullies, which have been worked for
gold, are numerous water-worn blocks of basalt and
much heavy quartz gravel, evidently derived from a
now obliterated lead,
3.
Only a few slight indications of sedimentary de-
posits between the basalt and the bed-rock are visible,
but this is probably owing to their being concealed by
slipped and fallen debris.
4.
Layers of yellowish-brown foliated clay containing
fossil-leaf impressions.
5.
These patches of basalt appear to be remnants ofa
flow or flows from the N.W., and to have been once
continuous with the larger basaltic area to the S.E.
6.
Clays, sand, and lignite exposed by land-slips, and
probably overlying gravels which join those of White's
claim beneath the basalt.
7.
Beds of clay, sand, and lignite similar to and pro-
bably continuous with those referred to in Note 6.
8.
Beds of clay, sand, and auriferous gravel, forming a
well-defined lead, portion if not all of whose heads were
from the N.W. It is possible that the lead at White’s
may be one of its heads, and that a “ high reef” passing
under Paw Paw Plain divides White’s 3?ead from the
deposits referred to in Notes 6 and 7.
a 8. —The basalt is here low enough to admit of the
outlet of White’s Lead being on this fall, but the quan-
tity of slipped material is so great that no positive
indications can be seen.
9.
There is every indication of this being the outlet of
Morris’s Lead from beneath Boiler Plain, and that a
junction with the deposits described in Note 7 took place
between here and Mount Tabletop.
10.
Heavy deposits of gravel (auriferous) presenting the
appearance of being the eastern margin of a bend in the
main lead from Boiler Plain.
a 10.—A small branch “ run ” of gravel here passes
under the basalt, and apparently is tributary to the lead
at Armour’s.
n.
Heavy auriferous gravels, with sand, clay, and con-
glomerates. Among the fossil leaves discovered was
Cinnamomum polymorphoides of the Middle Tertiary
or Miocene era.
12.
Heavy deposits of coarse gravel, which appear
likely to extend eastward under the basalt, and join the
main lead from Synnott's.
13.
The gold in this creek has been traced nearly to the
basalt boundary, and has probably been derived from
the denudation of portion of the eastern extension of
the gravel described in Note 12, though any outcrop of
gravel which may exist is here concealed by fallen
basalt and other debris.
14.
Heavy auriferous gravel, apparently coming from
the westward, and a continuation of that at al4 and
614.
15.
These ranges consist of gneiss and granite; the
latter in places still retains indications of a formerly
schistose character.
16.
This patch of basalt appears to be In no way con-
nected with that of the S.W., but is apparently a vestige
of a flow from the north, which went in a south-easterly
direction over what is now the valley of the Big River.
17.
Open plain, consisting of mica schist; the ranges to
the north, south, and east consist of granite, exhibiting
faintly a schistose character.
18.
The basalt of these plains, as also that of the various
small outliers, is generally hard, dark, and dense, ex-
hibiting in many places the columnar structure (large
pentagonal prisms) in a very marked degree,
19.
This basaltic area has not been well examined, and
though underlying drift deposits are not shown, it is
likely that they exist, and that this is portion of a flow
approximating in course to the direction of the Cobungra
Valley.
20.
The bed-rock appears high up under the basalt on
the N.E., and low down the S.W. side of Mount Bat-
tery ; indicating this as the north-eastern margin of the
lava-flow referred to in Note 19.
21.
Drifts and hard conglomerates; stated to have been
prospected, but without finding payable gold. From a
point about north from here downwards the Cobungra
River has been profitably worked, and the gold has pro-
bably been derived from the denuded auriferous portions
of the Middle Tertiary drifts.
22.
The rocks along the Victoria valley consist prin-
cipally of mica schist, sometimes contorted and passing
into gneiss.
23.
A fine illustration is here observable of the gradual
passage from unaltered to altered rock, which is notice-
able all along the Silurian and metaraorphic boundary.
The unaltered clay-slates, shales, &c., pass into silky
micaceous shale, which passes into mica schist, and
the latter in turn is altered into gneiss and schistose
granite.

are impassable on account of the snow, and although the soil is in many places
very rich the irregularity of the seasons and the frequency of sudden and severe
frosts, even during summer, would be very prejudicial to agriculture.
The geological formations in the district mapped are few in number and their
stratigraphical relations simple and easily understood.
Lower Silurian slates, shales, and sandstones, and metamorphic schists and
granites form the bed-rock of the whole ; this bed-rock is overlaid in parts by
gravels, sands, and clays, whose fossil flora indicate them to be of Miocene or
Middle Tertiary age, and, wherever found, these are covered by varying thicknesses
of lava, forming the plateaux or high plains already referred to. The highest
peaks consist of the Paheozoic rocks, which are also plainly exposed in all the
deeper rivers and creeks that intersect the plateaux and separate them from one
another ; these watercourses contain drifts and gravels of Post-Tertiary age, made
up of the materials denuded from the bed-rock, the Middle Tertiary beds, and the
basalts.
The geological history of the district, deduced from the above data, is that in
Middle Tertiary times the bods of the ancient watercourses were at a far higher
relative elevation than those of the present day; that flows of lava took place
which filled in the valleys of the period, and that the present rivers then commenced
to cut their way, and have, during long ages, eroded their valleys as they now exist,
sometimes parallel with and sometimes across the ancient river beds.
The changes of watershed and the deviations of the drainage channels caused
by the lava-flows will be more particularly described hereafter.
As before stated, the Palaeozoic bed-rock of the district consists of Lower
Silurian and metamorphic rocks, and it is observable that between these there is no
arbitrary line of demarcation, though the general line of boundary between the
two may he roughly described as running in a north-westerly direction from between
Mounts Birregon and Phipps along the eastern side of the Dargo to Mayford ;
thence across the Main Divide into the Cobungra ; thence along the western side
of the main Cobungra to a very low saddle between it and the Kiewa ; and thence
northerly along the western side of the Kiewa.
The unaltered Silurian rocks consist of the usual sandstones, shales, and clay
slates, but as the metamorphic region is approached a gradual and regular transition
is observable. The unaltered shales, &c., pass into silky micaceous shales, followed
by mica schist, passing into gneiss and granitoid schists, which in turn pass into a
granite that sometimes retains a faintly traceable schistose character. This gradual
passage was specially pointed out to me by Mr. A. W. Howitt, during a journey
taken in his company in 1873, while descending into the Dargo, at Mayford, from
the Omeo side.
On the road from Omeo to Mayford the highly metamorphosed rocks are found
to prevail along the Victoria valley to the Main Divide ; they consist of mica
schists, sometimes contorted, passing into gneiss, and the strikes observed were from
N. 75° W. to N. 85° W. On the spur from the Main Divide down to Mayford,
known as King’s Spur, the strike is N. 80° W. and the dip N. 10° E. at 85°, and
on this spur is clearly visible the gradual passage from gneiss to mica schist, thence
to silky micaceous shale, and thence to the unaltered slates and sandstones.
Leptynite schist containing decomposed garnets occurs here, and also a band
resembling a greenstone dyke of quartz and green hornblende.

BOGONG HIGH PLAIN S AND SOURCES OF THE BUNDARRAH RIVER.


Along the spur the strikes observed
varied from N. 20° W. to N. 80° W.,
and the dips correspondingly from N.
70° E. to N. 10° E. at from 65° to
85°. The unaltered rocks in the
Dargo River dip N. 40° E. at 80° and
strike N. 50° W.; at the Eighteen-
mile Creek, between Mayford and
Grant, the dip observed was N.E.
at 73°.
The same general north-westerly
direction of strike prevails on the
Cobungra fall of the Main Divide,
but the dip is south-westerly, indi-
cating a synclinal fold between the
Dargo and the Cobungra. —{See Sec-
tion 1.) One dip near Mount Hotham
is S.W. at 58°, and several other ob-
servations gave nearly the same result
—a north-westerly strike and a south-
westerly dip.
The metamorphic rocks show in
their strikes a general parallelism to
the unaltered strata, and the infer-
ence drawn from this, as well as the
fact of the gradual passage between
them, is that the metamorphic rocks
were once part of the Silurian system,
and have been changed, by whatever
metamorphic agencies, from the con-
ditions of slate, shale, and sandstone,
to those of mica schist, gneiss, and
granite ; the extent of the alteration
varying according to the intensity or
proximity of the metamorphic agen-
cies. The transition above described
coincides with that treated of by
Bernhard von Cotta in his “Rocks
Classified and Arranged,” and he
strongly suggests hydroplutonic ac-
tion, or the combined agencies of heat
generated by pressure, and permeating
waters, as the cause which produced
the metamorphism of sedimentary
rocks into crystalline schists. The
granite in this part of the country,
being clearly a metamorphic and not an
intrusive granite, is not distinguished

into it.
Middle Tertiaet.
The Middle Tertiary deposits, being covered with basalt, are only exposed on
the slopes into creeks and rivers which have cut through them into the bed-rock,
and consist, where visible, of gravels, conglomerates, clays, sands, and occasionally
impure lignites. The heavy gravels usually lie on the bed-rock, and above them
are alternating clays, sands, and finer gravels, with bands of silicious or ferruginous
conglomerate, the uppermost beds consisting of the finer clays, sands, and lignites.
These deposits occupy well-defined troughs in the bed-rock, and although much
intersected and divided into separate areas by the existing more deeply eroded
valleys, their former connection may be traced with tolerable certainty, and an idea
presented to the mind of the conditions of the country during that epoch. The few
places where the gravels have been worked for gold, and the small sections afforded
by land-slips, are the only spots where the deposits can be observed, as great masses
of mixed debris brought down by land-slips usually prevent the relations and total
thickness of the beds from being ascertained with accuracy. In tracing the line of
contact of the bed-rock with the superimposed deposits, it is noticeable that the
surface of the former slopes far less abruptly than do the steep inclines walling the
present rivers ; and this, coupled with the palustral aspect of some of the Middle
Tertiary beds, would lead to the inference that the main river valleys of that period
were broad and shallow, though their minor tributaries may have resembled those
of the present mountain streams. As suggested to me by Mr. A. W. Howitt, they
probably resembled some of the mountain straths of the present day, such as
Delegete Plain, a long level flat of marshy deposits covering gravels through which
the present river winds.
While the incline of the ancient river beds was steep the deposits would consist
principally of gravels, but as these accumulated in the lower portions, and the bed-
rock became more deeply eroded towards the heads of the streams, the incline
would become more horizontal, and, as a natural consequence, the finer sediments
only would continue to be carried down, and, overspreading the gravels, form wide
marshy flats. This view is well borne out by the character and the fossil flora of
the Middle Tertiary beds. As the small isolated basaltic patches which cap hills
separated from the larger plateaux were once evidently continuous with the latter,
and on or near the courses of former streams, and at the same time of little less
elevation than the highest peaks of Mounts Feathertop, Hotham, Cope, and others,
it is clear that the ranges forming the ancient watershed lines, of which the
mountains named are probably remnants, were once of far greater elevation than
they are now, and have been reduced by denudation hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of feet during the time that the same action has taken to erode the deep valleys at
their bases.
This suggests that the lava-flows did not form the widespread sheets they have
been supposed to have done, but that they followed the valleys, were confined to
them, and separated from one another by their dividing ridges, except in a few
cases where the latter were comparatively low. The denuding influences subse-
quent to the lava-flows met with less resistance from the slates and shales of the
dividing ridges than from the hard basalts, and consequently the surface of the


former, once far higher, has been worn down in many places to a lower level than
that of the latter (indicated by dotted lines in Section No. 2).*
As the isolated patches of basalt are
here the principal evidences on which to
base any theory as to the ancient water-
shed lines, their position will now be
described, starting from the supposed
former Main Divide, which in this portion
of the country appears to have been fur-
ther north, anterior to the lava-flows,
than at present.
The Mount Fainter range, starting from
the basaltic plateau between the Kiewa
and the Bundarrah, or Bogong High
Plains, runs N.N.W. between the two
main branches of the Kiewa, and attains
its highest elevation (about 6,160 feet) at
Mount Fainter, four miles north-easterly
from Mount Feathertop. The summit of
Mount Fainter is a basaltic patch of about
half an acre, resting on the metamorphic
granite without apparent intervention of
drift, and is the most northerly occurrence
of basalt in the area surveyed. From
Mount Fainter to the nearest tongue of
basalt from the Bogong High Plain the
distance is three miles, along a rugged
granite range devoid of any Tertiary or
basaltic capping whatever, but in some
gullies worked for gold, on the eastern
fall of this range, are numerous water-
worn blocks of basalt, large well-rounded
quartz boulders, and gravel of materials
foreign to the neighboring bed-rock, evi-
dently the re-distribution of the gravels
and overlying basalt of a former lead.
This points to a previous connection
between the large plateau and the basalt
on Mount Fainter, which is apparently a

mere vestige left on what was the western side of the old stream ; the bed-rock
beneath the basalt rising higher on the western than on the eastern side of the hill.
The highest point of the Bogong plain is 200 feet lower than Mount Fainter, so
that the fall of the ancient stream was in an opposite direction to that of the
Kiewa Eiver, which has cut back to its present head. Another patch of basalt,
three miles N.N.E. from Mount Cope, on the divide between the Kiewa and the
Big Eiver, has no apparent relation to the large plateau to ’the south-west, its

elevation being 400 feet less, and the higher intervening granite range showing no
patch of basalt or opening indicating a former connection between them. The
appearance of this patch of basalt indicates the course of the valley which it once
occupied as from N.W. to S.E. The basaltic portion of the Bogong High Plain
has an extreme length N. and S. of four miles by a width of three miles, containing
an area of about seven square miles. Around the edges of the basalt no distinct
outcrops of gravel are visible, a few scattered quartz pebbles and fragments of
cement being the only visible indications on the slopes into the Cobungra and the
Kiewa of any deposits intervening between the lava and the bed-rock. That they
do exist, however, is nearly certain, but they are concealed by slipped and fallen
debris, and can only be exposed by labor. In a head of the Bundarrah, on the
south-western margin of the basalt, are exposed beds of yellowish-brown laminar
clay containing fossil leaves, on specimens of which, forwarded by me to the
Department of Mines, Professor McCoy remarks as follows “ The specimens
from this locality are of great interest, from containing a new species of Taniopteris,
T. tenuissime striata (McCoy), the first example of this in Tertiary rocks in Aus-
tralia, although well known in rocks of this age in other parts of the world. There
is also a Lastrea, L. Dargoensis (McCoy), allied to a Miocene species from the
Arctic regions. With these are a few fragments of dicotyledonous leaves, appa-
rently identical with some from Bacchus Marsh, but too imperfect for precise
identification.”
Only a small exposure is visible, and no data were obtainable as to the thickness
of the beds. A hole sunk below them by the Government prospecting party to a
depth of nine feet passed through what resembled decomposed basalt containing
calcite. As the fossiliferous beds are clearly overlaid by basalt, the presence of
the same below them points to the existence of two separate lava-flows, with inter-
vening sedimentary beds. No gravel was found, but it is nearly certain to exist
somewhere beneath the basalt, though only to be discovered by sinking or tun-
nelling. That the sedimentary beds beneath this plateau were deposited by waters
flowing from the direction of Mount Fainter is tolerably certain, but the considera-
tion of their connection with those south of the Cobungra will be deferred until the
latter have been described.
On the Divide between the Diamantina branch of the Kiewa and the heads of the
Cobungra, about two miles N.E. from Mount Hotham, is a small basaltic outlier

capping a hill 6,175 feet, or about 74 feet higher than Mount Hotham, above sea-
level. In a direction S.S.E. from this hill are a few more small basalt patches of


less elevation, but once continuous with it, and also with the basalt south of the
Cobungra, the intervening portions having been removed during the erosion of that
river and its branches. There is no basalt on the summit of Mount Hotham ; but
on its eastern side, by the Omeo and Harrietville road, is a very small outlier ;
further south-easterly, along the road, are two separate outliers, forming con-
spicuous hills, known as Higinbotham Heights ; and about three miles from Mount
Hotham commences an area of basalt which occupies the Main Divide from that
point to one north-easterly from Mayford, and also extends for a short distance
along the divide between the Cobungra and the Victoria. —(See Section No. 3.)
On leading spurs from the Main Divide into the Dargo are two detached basaltic
plateaux of little less elevation than the main range, and connected with it by
saddles, on which the bed-rock appears at the surface. The western of these is
known as Boiler Plain, the eastern as Mount Tabletop, and they are both of im-
portance in connection with the sub-basaltic leads. On a spur into the Cobungra,
between two of its tributaries, called Murphy’s and Brandy creeks, is an exposure
of gravel beneath the basalt, which is being worked for gold, and is known as
White’s claim. On the slope, W.N.W. from Boiler Plain, into the Dargo, is
another worked exposure of sub-basaltic gravel known as Morris’s claim ; and near
the southern end of the basalt of Mount Tabletop, on the fall westerly into the
Dargo, is another known as Armour’s claim. The bed-rock of the gravel lead at
White’s is about 4,800 feet; that at Morris’s claim, on the other side of the Main
Divide, 4,640 feet ; and Paw Paw Plain, on the summit of the Main Divide, between
the two claims, 5,350 to 5,500 feet above sea-level. The gravel at White’s claim is
about 15 feet in thickness, with a few hard ferruginous bands ;it is coarse on
the bed-rock, becoming somewhat finer upwards, and consists of boulders and
pebbles of quartz and the harder portions of the metamorphic and Silurian rocks
intermixed with sand and clay. Above the gravel are beds of white clay and sand,
but the actual section from the bed-rock to the basalt is not known, though the
total thickness may be estimated at 130 feet.
There are two “ runs” of gravel, one on each side of
the spur, with a rise in the bed-rock between them,
indicating two leads, which meet under the basalt, as
represented in the sketch (Fig. 4).
The workings prove that the channel trends towards
the Main Divide, as the bed inclines gradually in that
direction. South-east from White’s claim, on the oppo-
site side of Brandy Creek, and between the heads
thereof, are land-slips along the basalt boundary, in
which are exposed beds of sand, lignite, and clay,
containing fossil lauraceous leaves and other plant
remains. An attempt was made under my advice by
the prospecting party to sink here for auriferous gravel.

tion of two auriferous

but was desisted from on finding that the time required to test tbe locality properly
would, on account of the immense quantity of slipped material, be too long to admit
of their likewise prospecting, within the period of their engagement, other more
easily tried places requiring attention.
As the basalt boundary is followed easterly from here along the Cobungra slope,
the bed-rock is found to rise gradually to an elevation considerably above that of


White’s claim, and westerly from White’s claim along the slope into Murphy’s
Creek the bed-rock rises similarly, until it forms the surface rock of the Main
Divide at the head of Murphy’s Creek, whence it again falls to a low level, in the
direction of Boiler Plain, along the slope into the Dargo. As regards the connec-
tion of the deposits of the Bogong plateau with those at White’s claim, it can only
he said that there is nothing to justify a decided opinion as to whether the former
represent the upper continuation of the latter, or of an old channel which approxi-
mated in course to that of the present Cobungra. On the range between the
Cohungra and the Bundarrah, and on that between the Cobungra and the Victoria,
there are small basaltic plateaux, and it is noticeable that, where absent on one side,
they occur on the opposite one, indicating that the present Cobungra has followed
approximately the course of an old river, cutting its way first on one side and then
on the other of the lava which had filled it in. Mount Battery, on the spur
between the Cobungra and the Bundarrah, is the last occurrence of basalt in this
direction, and the basalt here descends low down the slope towards the Cobungra,
while the bed-rock rises nearly to the summit of the hill on the opposite fall.
Under the basalt of Horsehair Plain, on the opposite side of the Cohungra to Mount
Battery, are deposits of gravel and cement, but they have not yet been properly
examined. —{See Section No. 2.) As the country falls considerably towards the
Big River, the continuation of the basalt and underlying deposits beyond Mount
Battery has been entirely removed, but there is no doubt that the trend was towards
the Mitta Mitta valley. The predominance of granite and metamorphic pebbles in
the drift at White’s claim show that it must have mainly come from a direction not
further west than between Mount Feathertop and Mount Fainter; and the very low
saddle between the Kiewa and the Cobungra, shown in the accompanying sketch by
Mr. A. W. Howitt, suggests that that was its course. It remains an open question,
therefore, whether the deposits beneath the Bogong plateau represent the upper
continuation of those at White’s claim or of those in the direction of Mount Battery.
If the first hypothesis be correct, the Main Divide of the Miocene era must have
deviated from its present course at some point near the head of the Victoria, and
extended to Mount Cope ; thence around the north of Mount Fainter and back to
the south-west; if the second, it must have held its course from about the same
point of deviation, rather more to the westward, in the direction of Mount Fainter.
As before stated, Boiler Plain is a detached basaltic table-land, on a spur from
the Main Divide into the Dargo ; between it and the Main Divide is a saddle, on
which the bed-rock is at the surface, and from either side of this saddle head creeks
running into the Dargo. On the fall from Boiler Plain, towards the junction of
the western creek with the Dargo, and at a lower level than the saddle referred to,
is the exposure of gravel opened and worked by Mr. Saul Morris, who first found
and worked out a highly payable patch of auriferous gravel on a little saddle from
which the basalt had been apparently denuded, not far from, and slightly above the
level of the sub-basaltic exposure ; and then, prospecting the latter, traced gold
down the western “ rim rock,” or boundary reef of the gravel lead. The workings
(now abandoned) expose a considerable thickness of gravel, with sandy and clayey
layers. The deepest part of the gravel has been lately reached by a tunnel put in
at Government expense, and the bed is found to pitch to the south-east. Land-slips
in the vicinity expose beds of clay and impure lignite appearing from beneath the
basalt above the level of the gravel.


SOURCES OF THE COBUNGRA RIVER
from, near White's claim.


At the southern point of the basalt of Boiler Plain the bed-rock is high and far
above the level of Morris’s claim, but on the south-eastern fall from the plain the
basalt goes down to a level as low as, if not lower than, that of the claim. Only
faint signs of wash from beneath this basalt were detected by me during the exami-
nation made, but the great amount of fallen basalt and other debris rendered super-
ficial search useless. We have thus the “high reef” at the north-eastern and
southern extremities of Boiler Plain ; a proved deposit of gravels, &c., passing
under the basalt on the north side, and indications of an apparent outlet of the
same on the south-east side. East from the saddle between Boiler Plain and the
Main Divide, the bed-rock again descends, and in a race on a level with the saddle
along the slope are exposed beds of laminated clay, lignite, and sand ; below this
the ground is again found so broken and covered with fallen masses that nothing
definite can be ascertained, but at the same time the general indications are that
the bed-rock descends to a level below that of White’s claim on the other side of
the Main Divide ; and I have no hesitation in expressing an opinion that these
deposits are continuous beneath the basalt with those exposed in the land-
slips at the heads of Brandy Creek, and probably also with those at White’s
claim.
It is possible that the lead at White’s claim may have taken a more westerly
course and be the upper continuation of that at Morris’s claim, but the usual diffi-
culties in the shape of fallen rock prevented my ascertaining the existence of gravels
beneath the basalt on the fall from the Main Divide opposite the latter ; the basalt,
however, appears to be low enough to admit of such being the case.
It is also highly probable that some of the heads of the Boiler Plain lead came
from the direction of the present heads of the Dargo, and that the basaltic patches
near Mount Hotham mark the vicinity of the course of one of the former tributaries.
There appears no doubt that the deposits beneath Boiler Plain, and those described
as appearing in the race east of the saddle, once joined, but their junction and south-
easterly extension have been removed by denudation.
The bed-rock in the saddle connecting Mount Tabletop with the Main Divide
rises to a level above the sedimentary deposits between it and Boiler Plain, and at
a lower level, to the eastward at the N.E. extremity of the Tabletop basalt, there is
a deposit of sand and gravel which apparently runs in under the plateau, and is a
tributary to the lead worked at Armour’s claim. The contact of the bed-rock with
the basalt continues high from this point along the eastern side of Mount Tabletop,
but on the south-western side the basalt is lower, and there is beneath it a heavy
deposit of gravel traceable for some distance. The information afforded by Mr.
Armour’s workings leads to the belief that this gravel is the vestige of a bend in
the main lead from Boiler Plain with which that passing under Mount Tabletop
has j'oined, and its elevation, which is about 400 feet less than Morris’s claim,
supports the conjecture. —(See Section No. 1.)
The basalt extends along the Main Divide to a point eastward from Tabletop on
the opposite side of Tabletop Creek, and also down the divide between the Victoria
and the Cobungra, but there were no indications observed in the form of exposures
of gravel, or low levels of the contact of the bed-rock and basalt, which would lead
to the opinion that the outlet of the Middle Tertiary deposits of White’s claim and
Boiler Plain was in any other direction than by the way of what is now the western
slope of Mount Tabletop.
p


The next continuation of the Middle Tertiary deposits and their overlying lava is
that of the Dargo High Plains, a gap of about three miles across having been caused
by the erosion of the Dargo valley. The track from Mayford to Grant ascends a
spur from the Dargo known as the Mayford spur, and from the summit of the
spur the basaltic plateau extends westerly to near the head of the Thirty-mile
Creek and southerly to the Eighteen-mile Creek ; a large creek called the Little
Dargo heads from the Grant track on the table-land, about four miles from Mayford,
and runs into the main Dargo, opposite Mount Birregon, a spur fourteen miles
long, capped with basalt for a part of its length, separating the two streams. The
heads of other creeks also cause the margin of the plateau to be divided into spurs
and tongues of table-land, consisting of basalt on top and Silurian below, with
occasional intervening gravels, &c. —(See Section No. 1.)
On the Mayford spur the Silurian and Tertiary boundary is about 3,950 feet,
and the point of the table-land about 4,700 feet above sea-level, or 1,400 and 2,150
feet respectively above the level of the Dargo at Mayford. On following this
boundary westerly from the spur the Silurian bed-rock is found for a very short
distance to fall slightly, and then rise, a large deposit of heavy gravel occupying
the depression and passing beneath the basalt : this has been partially worked for
gold with more or less success, but is at present abandoned. Further to the west
the bed-rock gradually rises, until, on the range between the Dargo and the Thirty-
mile Creek, at the western extremity of the basaltic plateau, it is found at an alti-
tude of 5,200 feet above sea-level. —(See Section No. 2.) A quarter of a mile
south-easterly from the workings on Mayford spur, along the slope towards the
Dargo, are other workings also abandoned, known as Synnot’s claim, where several
extensive excavations have been made into the side of the hill, revealing a great
thickness of gravel with some bands of foliated sandy clay, in which Mr. A. W.
Howitt found Cinnamomum polymorphoides, identified and figured by Professor
McCoy, in his Decade No. IV., as belonging to a fossil flora of Miocene age.
Synnot’s party drove a tunnel through the “rim-rock” about 100 feet westerly into
the hill, but after following the surface of the bed-rock to near the end of the
tunnel it was found to dip inwards too much to admit of the tunnel being pro-
fitably worked further, showing that the main channel was further in beneath the
hill, and running nearly parallel with its external slope. At a height of 300 feet
above the tunnel there are exposed by land-slips fragments of clays and impure
lignites, but whether the whole thickness from these to the gravel at the tunnel
consists of sedimentary deposits, or whether there is an intervening layer of basalt,
is uncertain. From Synnot’s claim the gravels, &c., pass beneath a high basaltic
point, on the eastern side of which, towards the Dargo, the bed-rock is seen above
the level of the tunnel : on the fall from this point, over into Pyke’s Creek, are
clear indications of the outlet of the gravels from Synnot’s claim, and slightly
below the level thereof, the bed-rock rising both to the east and west : here also
are silicious conglomerates and ferruginous bands containing fossil leaves, on speci-
mens of which, forwarded by me to the Department of Mines, Professor McCoy
remarks as follows : —“ From this locality there are several imperfect lauraceous
leaves of undescribed species occurring also in the Miocene Tertiary beds of Bacchus
Marsh ; with these is a most interesting specimen of a species of Salisburia,
S. Murrayi (McCoy), nearly allied to some Miocene forms from the Arctic regions,
but not hitherto found in the Australian strata.”


On the south side of Pyke’s Creek, at a still descending elevation, the above
described gravels are again found passing beneath the long spur of table-land
separating that creek from the Little Dargo, and out again on the fall into the
latter, the rising boundary reefs east and west being still traceable. From the
Little Dargo around the eastern fall from the plateau, as far as the Eighteen-mile
Creek, are numerous indications of gravel from beneath the basalt, but the course
of the main lead from Synnot’s tunnel has not been traced southward with certainty
beyond the slope north of the Little Dargo. At a place called German terrace, on
the fall into the Dargo, two miles from the head of the Eighteen-mile Creek, is a
very heavy gravel, the fallen debris from which on the hill side has been worked
for gold; this is apparently a tributary coming from the S.W., as there are abundant
indications of gravel and conglomerate passing in under the basalt near the Eighteen-
mile Creek, at a higher elevation than German terrace. At one of the western
points of the Dargo plateau, south-west from the Harrietville track, on the divide
between the Twenty-five-mile and Thirty-mile creeks, is a very heavy gravel
passing in under the basalt at high elevation, and this, I think, represents a large
tributary from the west to the main lead, and its course will be found to extend
beneath the basalt near the head of the Twenty-five-mile, and either join the main
lead or pass out from beneath the basalt on the fall towards the Dargo. Other
small basaltic outliers covering gravels are stated to occur in the mountains to the
westward, but whether those were connected with the Dargo formations or belong
to a separate system cannot be ascertained until the country has been further
examined.
From the Eighteen-mile Creek downwards the Dargo valley itself seems to
follow at a lower level the course of the old lead, every vestige of basalt and under-
lying drifts having been swept away. Mount Ewen, on the range to the west, and
Mount Birregon, on that to the east of the Dargo, both high points consisting of
Silurian rocks, may be regarded as portions of the ancient, as they are of the
present, watershed line of the Dargo River.
The general conclusions are, that this ancient river—the Dargo of the Miocene
epoch—headed from near Mount Fainter ; that the deposits at White’s claim.
Boiler Plain, Mount Tabletop, and Mayford spur, are remnants of its bed, or those
of its branches ; that the intervening parts, and the heads of most of the tributaries,
have been entirely removed during the deeper erosion of present rivers ; that a large
western affluent came in from a direction across what are now the courses of the
Twenty-five-mile and Thirty-mile creeks, the two main heads of the Crooked
River ; and that the southern extension of the ancient system, from the Eighteen-
mile Creek downwards, has been utterly obliterated, though the ancient river pro-
bably joined the sea of the Miocene epoch near where the Mitchell valley now
emerges from the ranges.
The lava-flows, by filling in the old drainage channels, caused those which
formed afterwards to deviate from the original beds ; and while we find evidences of
ancient streams, corresponding to the present Dargo and Cobungra rivers, separated
by a main divide which had partly the same and partly a different course from the
present one, we find that the deviations caused by the lava-flows have resulted in
the changes of watershed by which the heads of the Cobungra River and those of
the Crooked River now occupy respectively the country once drained by the
northern and western heads of the ancient Dargo.


It does not appear tliat glacial action took any part in the denudation of the
country since Miocene times, as there are no signs of it in the Dargo and Cobungra
valleys : fluviatile and atmospheric action, the former perhaps once more potent
than now, seem to have been the only agencies that sculptured the country to its
present form subsequent to the lava-flows.
Volcanic.
The basalt or lava forming the high plains is here referred to the Older Volcanic
(Miocene) period, immediately overlying, as it does, sedimentary deposits, shown
by their fossil flora to be of Miocene or Middle Tertiary age. Objection may be
taken to this classification on the ground that the fact of basalt overlying Miocene
deposits does not necessarily prove it to belong to that epoch, but the evidences
here are to the effect that the Miocene beds were still in actual progress of deposition
when the lava poured over them.
The general structure of the basalt is columnar, fine specimens of the large
pentagonal columns occurring near Mount Hotham and elsewhere,
Portions of the surface of the Bogong High Plains have the appearance of being
paved with five-sided blocks of stone, and on some of the mountain sides, where
land-slips have taken place, are acres covered with jumbled heaps of five-sided logs
of basalt.
The basalt throughout this country is highly magnetic, so much so that, when
taking compass bearings, I have had to ascend trees and observe from the elevation
so attained, to escape the influence of the rock on the instrument. In an appendix
by Mr. A. W. Howitt will be found detailed mineralogical descriptions and results
of microscopic examination of the principal varieties found. As before pointed out,
there may have been more than one flow of lava, and indeed it is hardly reasonable
to suppose that the entire thickness of basalt, amounting, as before shown, in some
places to 700 feet in thickness, could have been poured out in a single stream. No
apparent vents, or pipes, whence the lava-flows issued, have been discovered, but
they probably exist in the country to the north and north-west, and being, as such
usually are, of small extent, have not yet been noticed.
Having so far described the geological aspect of the Bogong and Dargo plateaux,
it remains to be considered whether these plateaux are likely to afford extensive
and remunerative employment to miners, and, if so, what is the best way to develop
their resources.
Auriferous Character of the Drifts.
At White’s claim the gold was first found around the edge of the gravel, at its
contact with the Silurian, and, as might he expected from the natural sluicing
operations in force during the denudation of the country, the gold was here richer
in quantity than it was found to be subsequently while working the gravel in situ.
At the same time, the party now working the claim find a well-defined “run,” or
lead, about 20 feet wide, yielding moderately payable gold, and evidently continuing
under the basalt in a southerly direction. At Morris’s claim, below Boiler Plain,
the richest gold was got in the little isolated remnant of gravel first found, and the
gold was here heavy and coarse : at the workings, where the tunnel advised to be
driven by Mr. R. Brough Smyth was put in along the bed of the lead, the gold was


found coarse and of a good sample on the high reef on the western slope of the
gutter. Previous to the contractors’ commencing the tunnel, the Government
prospecting party, under my advice, commenced a shaft which would probably have
reached the deepest ground within 20 feet of the surface, but on arrangements
being completed to drive the tunnel to test the same ground, and on finding the
tools they then had were insufficient to get through the hard cement reached at 10
feet, they desisted from further sinking. The last 6 feet of the shaft passed
through coarse heavy gravel, and in every dish tried from twenty to fifty specks of
fine gold were obtained, and the last, from the cement, was of somewhat heavier
character than that washed from the stuff above. The prospects since obtained by
the men who drove the tunnel show a still further improvement, though not equal
to the prospects reported from the higher reef ; this, however, is by no means un-
common in mining experience, as it is frequent both in deep and shallow alluvial
mining to find the richest deposits of gold on points and slopes of the bed-rock, as
well as in the deepest portions of the bed.
At Mr. Armour’s claim, at the southern end of Mount Tabletop, the proprietors
have made fair wages, though much time has been lost through scarcity of water ;
the gold is here fine, but weighs well. No certain information was obtained as to
the gold obtained in the workings at Mayford spur, but the general account is
that it was payable, or nearly so, while water remained plentiful : most of the gold
here is fine, but a piece of 14 dwt. is reported to have been obtained from a blind
shaft sunk in the end of Synnot’s tunnel. Gold was also obtained by the Govern-
ment prospecting party during the little prospecting they were able to accomplish
in the gravels on the falls into the Little Dargo and Pyke’s Creek. Payable gold
is also reported in the gravel worked at German terrace, though the workings
there are merely in the mixed debris on the side of the hill, and have not been
carried into the wash in situ.
Many of the creeks and gullies draining the plateaux, though patchy, have
yielded good returns below where they have cut through the courses of the old
gravels ; the Twenty-five-mile Creek, in particular, is stated to have been best close
up to the junction of the Silurian and basalt, and was worked until the number and
size of the fallen blocks of the latter prevented the diggers from going further :
this indicates the proximity of the gravel of the great western affluent previously
referred to. The general information obtained all leads to the conclusion that the
gravels are auriferous throughout, but that, from their great thickness and the dis-
semination of the gold through a great portion of that thickness, they can only be
profitably worked on a large scale, and by means of an ample water supply for
ground sluicing or hydraulic mining. The latter method will only be available
within certain limits near the exposures of the gravels on the hill sides ; for as they
are worked in towards the hills, the enormous thickness of overlying clays and
sands, with the basalt above, will be too much even for the Californian hose to
compete with effectively. Ultimately, therefore, the working of the gravel will
have to be accomplished by means of tunnels, near the entrances of which water
will have to be conducted in sufficient volume to form powerful sluices, into which
the washdirt can be tipped as brought out. Even with the short races now in use
an over abundant supply of water is available during the wet season, but this runs
short during the dry months, so that, to enable regular work to be carried on, races
of great length tapping springs and the heads of constantly running streams would


be necessary to ensure a supply during the whole year. Those who have hitherto
worked the places described have been men of limited means working for speedy
returns, and neither possessing at the commencement, nor winning subsequently
from the ground, sufficient to enable them to extend their races as they saw was
requisite, and no capitalists have yet turned their attention towards developing this
branch of mining in the Dargo and Bogong district.
Subjoined is an estimate of the lengths of the portions of the main lead and its
principal western tributary which remain undenuded south of the Cobungra, too
little being known of the deposits under the basalt of the Bogong plateau to admit
of their being included ; —Cobungra plateau, 3 miles ; Boiler Plain, 1 mile ; south-
west side of Tabletop, mile ; Mayford spur, mile ; between Pyke’s Creek and
Little Dargo, 1 mile ; western branch from direction of Thirty-mile Creek, 5 miles —
total, 12 miles. Other small leads concealed beneath the basalt might possibly
increase the actual length of workable ground to 20 miles. The width and thick-
ness of workable gravel will of course vary greatly, but may be estimated at from
20 to 100 feet for the former, and 2to 10 feet for the latter. I consider that there is
good reason for the opinion that fairly remunerative, and in places rich yields, are
likely to be obtained, but that, owing to the scarcity of quartz reefs in the adjacent
country, there are no grounds for expecting that they will approach in value the
returns from the leads of the western goldfields, which are situated in country
traversed by great belts of auriferous quartz reefs. Assuming the gravel included
in the above estimate to afford a fair margin of profit over working expenses, there
is certainly a great field open to the enterprise of the mining public.
Suggestions foe Government Prospecting.
I beg to suggest that a moderate outlay on the part of the Government is advisa-
ble for the purpose of ascertaining and informing the public of the value of the
gravels of the Dargo plateaux. The labors of the Omeo prospecting party were,
during the first portion of their engagement, directed to shallow ground at the
heads of the Cobungra, the Bundarrah, and the Kiewa, but it was intended that
they should also prospect the sub-basaltic gravels of the high plains. Unfortu-
nately they were not sent out until three of the most favorable months of the
year —November, December, and January —had passed, and the period of their
engagement expired with the close of the financial year, 30th June 1877. After
they had prospected the shallow ground, which they did well and thoroughly,
though unsuccessfully, they were unable, on account of the setting in of the wet
and snowy season, to do more than superficially try a few places where indications
of the outcrop of gravel were visible. I would therefore recommend that a small
party be fitted out solely for the purpose of prospecting the gravels appearing from
beneath the basalt on the falls from the Main Divide into the Cobungra and Dargo
rivers, and also on the western side of the Dargo : the operations of the party
should be under competent supervision, and be commenced in November, so as to
have six months of favorable weather before them. As already pointed out, a
number of places are now ascertained where the inlet or outlet of gravels beneath
the basalt are to be found in natural section, but the immense quantity of surface
debris prevents the exact level at which to drive into the gravel from being imme-
diately ascertained. To find the contact of the gravel and bed-rock in situ in the


deepest part of the channel should be the first object, and this can only be done by
experimental cuttings and shafts, sites for which would have to be selected accord-
ing to the circumstances of the appearance of the ground, the exposed occurrence
of the clay and sand beds above the
gravel, &c. The difficulties alluded to
and method of dealing with them are
illustrated in the accompanying sketch
(Fig. 5).
Once the actual bed of the lead is thus
found, the prospecting thereof by driving
along and across its course will be an easy
matter, and it should be tried across and
up the boundary reefs as far as gravel
continues, notes being taken of the amount
and thickness above the bed-rock of the
stuff washed, the width of auriferous
gravel, the yield, and all other points
bearing on the economy of mining. To
test only one or two places thoroughly in
the manner suggested would be of more

practical utility than to try superficially every gravel exposure in the district.
To prospect by boring has nothing to recommend it whatever ; however useful to
discover the trend of a lead in such country as that near Ballarat, it would possess no
advantages here, where the general courses of leads, from one point of exposure to
another, can be readily judged from surface examination. The expense of boring
500 to 1,000 feet, principally through basalt, would be very great, and as a means
of testing the auriferous quality of the gravels boring would be useless.

APPENDIX.
EXAMINATION OF ROCK SAMPLES COLLECTED BY REGINALD A. F. MURRAY AND
A. W. HOWITT AT THE BOGONG ANDDARGO HIGH PLAINS.
Twenty-five thin slices of these rocks were prepared, from which the following
have been selected as illustrative of the rocks of the district.
No. /.—Junction of Brandy Creek with the Cobungra River.
A fine-grained gneissose schist. An examination of the locality shows that the
Silurian slates and sandstones of the Upper Dargo become metamorphosed on the
eastern side of that river.
The changes observable in proceeding eastward are—l. Mica schist; 2. Gneiss ;
3. Granite.
This sample may represent those schists which stand between 1 and 2.
A thin slice of this sample was prepared perpendicular to the foliations.


It consists of alternate foliations of mica and quartz with a little felspar. The
foliations are of irregular thickness and uncertain distance apart, the separation
being made by narrow folia of mica. The mica is most probably hiotite. It is
brownish-yellow in color, and is strongly dichroic, changing in color, on rotation
over the polarizing nicol, from brown-yellow to nearly black. The quartz pre-
dominates much. It is not found in distinct grains, but in what may be termed
granulations, and of the kind usually seen in metamorphic schist. With it is a little
felspar, mostly monoclinic, but more rarely showing the triolinic striations. It is
nowhere well crystallized. Very few, if any, inclusions are to be observed, and these
of indefinite character.
A mica schist rich in quartz with a little subordinate felspar.
No. 2.—Source of the Kiewa River, Camp 4 of the Omeo Prospecting Party.
In tracing the metamorphic crystalline schists further to the eastward their
structure becomes coarser, and, finally, they are represented by rocks which might
either be termed coarse-grained gneiss or granite having a gneissic structure. An
examination of the district leads to the belief that these rocks represent the most
completely metamorphosed of the Silurian sediments.
The sample here chosen was an extreme form, in which the gneissic structure
was completely wanting. It represents a rather coarse, grey, ternary granite. The
rock occurs in weathered rounded masses protruding from the thick alpine sward of
the Bogong table-land.
In preparing a thin slice I found this rock to be one of the hardest and toughest
of the granite rocks which I had examined. Under the microscope it proved to be
a crystalline granular compound of—
(1.) Plagioclase. This triclinic felspar predominates in the structure and occurs
in two forms—(a.) Small well-crystallized prisms of the character often
met with in some granites, e.g., those of Beechworth and of Genoa Peak.
(b.) Some few larger crystals of remarkable polysynthetic structure. The
interior of one of these crystals, which was very distinctly shown in the
slice, consists of two portions, each of which is again compounded of
numerous laminae. These are probably compounded —first, according to the
law “ axis of rotation normal to iI ” ; second, according to the law “ axis
of rotation parallel to i i.” The exterior part of the crystal consists of a
rather wide margin, or shell, mostly homogeneous in character, but showing
plainly concentric growth, whilst, in places, the striations of the internal
halves extend into or across the external shell.
(2.) Of quartz grains of the character usual in granites. These fill in spaces
between the felspars. Fine hair-like bodies, and more rarely stout colorless
prisms, suggestive of apatite, are the only inclusions observable. Minute
fluid cavities are exceedingly numerous, but in only two or three cases
could I detect in them what seemed to be minute bubbles.
(3.) Of ill-formed crystals of monoclinic felspar. In many of these are portions
which show triclinic striae, indicating inter-growth of the two classes of
felspars. These orthoclase felspars are quite subordinate.
(4.) Of yellow-brown mica, in flakes lying between the other constituents.
They are strongly dichroic, yellow-brown, changing on being rotated
to almost black. A portion of the rock was roughly broken. Pieces of


felspar were picked out as free as possible from quartz or mica. These
were powdered, and digested for several days with concentrated hydro-
chloric acid. Partial decomposition took place, and the solution gave
a decided lime precipitate, with oxalate of ammonia. This reaction was
stronger than I have observed with oligoclase, but not by any means so
strong as that with the lime felspars of Swift’s Creek. The mica is
rather brittle, and in irregular flakes of a shining black. Before the
blowpipe it fuses without much difficulty to a black magnetic mass. It
is somewhat strongly acted upon by hydrochloric acid, and thus approaches
in these characters to lepidomelane.
Assuming that the determination of this granitic rock, as being an extreme example
of the metamorphic crystalline schist of the district, is correct, some interesting
points arise. An examination of a mass in the field would show that it strongly
resembles, in its structure, the true intrusive granites. A microscopic examination
of a thin slice would indicate it as being a quartz mica diorite, while its connection
by intermediate gradations with the gneisses of the Cobungra River would show
that it, like them, is the result of the metamorphism of sediments. A series of
analyses of the various rocks, commencing with the normal slates of the Cargo,
and ending with the plagioclase granite of the Bogong Plains, would be of the
highest interest.
No. 3. —Mount Fainter.
This is a basalt, having a microporphyritic structure.
The ground mass consists of interlacing minute plagioclase prisms, grains of
augite and olivine, and some magnetite.
In this are, porphyritically —
(1.) Imperfect crystals of augite.
(2.) A few large augite grains.
No. 4.—Sigh Point between Cobungra and Kiewa Rivers.
This basalt has a microporphyritic structure.
The ground mass is microcrystalline, consisting of minute plagioclase prisms and
grains of augite, olivine, and magnetite. In this are numerous imperfect olivine
crystals and granules.
The olivine crystals and granules are traversed by numerous irregular flaws,
along which alteration has set in, the result being a yellowish-brown or dark-
greenish serpentinous substance. The only inclusions in the olivine are opaque
octahedral crystals, magnetite, and a few less regularly formed, which are dark-
brown, and which may perhaps be picotite. But I was unable to confirm this.
No. s.—Bogong Plains.
A basalt, having a microporphyritic structure. The ground mass is composed of
rather long prisms of plagioclase, between which, besides some small amount of
devitrified base, are very numerous pale-brown augite granules and some magnetite.
In this are :
(1.) Olivine, as in No. 4.
(2.) Compound irregular masses of augite granules. One of these masses is
composed of augite and olivine granules.
Q


JVo. 6.—Divide between Cobungra and Bundarrah Rivers,
Basalt. The structure of the ground mass is semi-crystalline, or even granular.
Besides portions of dovi trifled base are grains of—
(1.) Augite of pale-brown color.
(2.) Small prisms of plagioclase scattered among the augite grains.
(3.) Magnetite and titanic iron, their respective rectangular and hexagonal
outlines being clearly distinguishable.
In this ground mass are—
(l.) Imperfectly formed olivine crystals, as in No. 4.
(2.) Masses of augite grains, arranged closely together, to the exclusion of the
other constituents. The augite includes magnetite.
No. 7.—Brandy Creek, Cobungra River.
This is a porphyritic dolerite. The ground mass is composed of—
(1.) Plagioclase prisms, aggregated together in groups.
(2.) Purplish-brown granules and imperfect crystals of augite.
(3.) Magnetite.
In this are porphyritic crystals of augite, about - 1 inch diameter. Polarized
light proves them to be clusters of more or less perfect crystals, which nearly all
show traces of twin structure. This augite is pale-brown yellow, and in places
purplish. Where the latter color occurs the augite is decidedly dichroic, and this
remark holds equally as to the small grains. Mr. Allport makes a similar remark
as to the augite of dolerites from Necropolis Hill, Glasgow.*
Among the other constituents is a yellowish-brown colored material filling in
irregular spaces, and having much the appearance of a secondary product. It is,
however, crossed in various directions by numerous short stout hexagonal prisms.
These are externally yellowish-brown, but internally colorless, as is shown by their
cross-sections. These behave exactly like apatite, when examined between crossed
nicols, and have the structure and appearance of that mineral.
No. B.—Brandy Creek, Cobungra River.
A porphyritic dolerite. The ground mass is as described in No. 7, but the triclinic
felspars are smaller in size. The porphyritic augite is remarkable for its size, and
its beautifully developed examples of twin structure.
The ground mass, as well as the various crystals, are permeated in places by a
dark-yellow secondary substance, which seems to be the result of decomposition of
perhaps olivine grains.
No. 9.—Bogong High Plains.
The mineral was observed to occur in rough fibrous-looking masses, about - 5 inch
diameter, in basalt, near the source of the Bundarrah River. In a thin slice it is almost
colorless, having only a faint trace of brown. It has a strongly marked but not
very regular cleavage (prismatic ?) in one direction. These cleavage planes are, in
places, lined by a black or dark-brown substance. A second cleavage of far less
marked character crosses the former at an angle of about 62° 30', which was the

mean of several measurements. Rows of minute black specks mark this latter
cleavage. These are also very numerous along the direction of the strong cleavage,
and, under a high power, prove to have, in many cases, a central clear spot sur-
rounded by a dark margin, and are probably air or gas cavities.
The application of polarized light showed that the optical properties of this
mineral are those of augite.
No. iO.—Battery Hill, Cobungra River.
This basalt has a microporphyritic structure. The ground mass is granular.
Together with portions of devitrified base are—
(l.) Augite granules.
(2.) A few small prisms of plagioclase.
(3.) Magnetite.
In this are larger porphyritic crystals of olivine.
No. //.—May ford Spur, Dargo River,
The basalt has a microcrystalline ground mass, consisting of—
(I.) Plagioclase prisms.
(2.) Augite grains, which in places are aggregated together, including prisms of
the triclinic felspars. These masses become wholly dark, as regards the
augite, when rotated between crossed nicols.
In this ground mass are more or less imperfect crystals of olivine.
No. i2.—Dargo High Plains.
This is a porphyritic dolerite, in which the porphyritic mineral is oligoclase, in
crystals. An example cut from one of the porphyritic crystals showed that it
consisted of beautifully compounded triclinic felspars, displaying the twin structure
very distinctly. The crystals are, however, not well formed, but have mutually
interfered with each other, thus producing a crystalline granular structure. Among
the well-characterized triclinic felspars are others without any striations, and which,
otherwise, much resemble orthoclase.
No. i3. — Eighteen-mile Creek, Dargo High Plains.
The structure of this basalt is microporphyritic. The ground mass consists of— l
(1.) A small portion of devitrifled base.
(2.) Very numerous narrow plagioclase prisms aggregated in groups, their longer
diameters being generally accordant in direction. In the neighborhood of
porphyritic crystals they conform to the outlines of the latter, but beyond
them resume their general direction.
(3.) Numerous exceedingly minute light-brown granules of augite.
(4.) Magnetite.
In this ground mass are numerous porphyritic grains and well-formed crystals of
olivine. This mineral is all more or less attacked along the irregular flaws traversing
it. The result is the production of a yellowish to dark-greenish serpentinous sub-
stance. In the slice the process of alteration may be well followed, from mere
stains to the complete destruction of the olivine.


Assuming that the age of the Dargo and Bogong basalt is that indicated by the
fossil flora of the streams which it overflowed and sealed up, it is manifestly of
interest to ascertain, if possible, whether it can be distinguished by any reliable
characters from those more recent basalts which occur elsewhere in Victoria —in
other words, the Newer Volcanic. For this purpose, I carefully examined the
examples which I already had prepared from near Melbourne, and, in addition,
completed a series collected from various parts of the Western district. I found the
structure and composition of both series, the older and the newer, to substantially
agree, the only distinction to be drawn being that in some of the Bogong and
Dargo rocks their porphyritic character and the prevalence, indeed preponderance,
of augite was marked. Considering, however, that the examples of newer basalts
from western Victoria were collected from more superficial and often very vesicular
or scoriaceous flows, while those from North Gippsland were taken from sheets of
basalt which represent only the deeper-seated portions of the sheets, this distinction
may be said to have little or indeed no weight. So far it may be said, therefore,
that my examination has shown no good distinction to exist in the structure and
composition of the newer and older basalt of Victoria.
In respect to these Gippsland basalts, I may notice, finally, that, where olivine
occurs as porphyritic crystals, augite retreats into microscopic dimensions, and
vice versa.
No. 14.—Dyke near Battery Hill, Cohungra River.
This traverses the metamorphic crystalline schists. It consists of plagioclase,
augite, magnetite, and chlorite. It is, therefore, a diabase, and its whole aspect
microscopically conforms to this definition.
No. 15. — Dyke, White's Claim, Brandy Creek, Cohungra River.
This rock has, under the microscope, a dark-colored finely-granular base, in which
are indistinct outlines of felspar crystals. Some few still retain striations. Two
irregular patches of dark-green chlorite (viridite) suggest former hornblende crystals.
This was probably a hornblende porphyrite.
No. 16. — Dyke, White’s Claim, Brandy Creek, Cohungra River.
Under the microscope this rock is seen to have a felsitic base, in which are grey
opaque patches resembling those resulting from the alteration of felspars. The
outlines are scarcely to be defined, owing to the general alteration which has taken
place. In the general mass are stout green and brownish hornblende prisms.
Apatite can be recognised in long narrow needles. A few quartz grains in interstices
suggest that they are secondary products derived from the alteration of the felspars.
This is probably a hornblende porphyrite, approaching a diorite in character, and
between which classes intermediate forms occur.
Nos. 15 and 16 traverse the Silurian strata near the metamorphic boundary.
No. 17. —Mount Flora, Bogong High Plains.
This mineral occurs among the decomposed basalt, at one of the sources of the
Bundarrah River. It is found in infiltrated masses, filling or incrusting cavities.
H. over 5 ; sp. gr., 3‘04 ; color, yellow-brown; streak, white.

A small percentage of MnO. C0 2 has not been determined, except qualitatively
before the blowpipe. Taking “ ferro-calcite ” to include those indefinitely mixed
carbonates occurring under such conditions as those above stated, it may be held
to merge on the one hand into calcite and on the other into spherosiderite. This
mineral would be thus included.
In the Mount Flora example the hardness and density are both unusually high,
and are evidently connected with the toughness of the mineral, as experienced in
preparing a thin slice. This, examined under the microscope, shows that the internal
structure of this mineral agrees with the view that “ ferro-calcite ” is no definite
mineral species. One portion of the slice is certainly a crystal, being wholly
obscured at the same time between crossed nicols. It also polarizes with far more
color than usually does calcite, and it is traversed by a well-marked rhombic
cleavage. The remainder polarizes merely as an aggregate of doubly refracting
particles, without color. In this portion are specially included some black flocks,
which are probably impurities derived from the decomposing basalt.
This mineral is therefore, it seems, a mixture of the carbonates, and not a definite
compound.

THE BUCHAN LIMESTONES.
In a footnote appended to page 199 of my former paper on this subject I stated that
at Butcher’s Creek I had found that the Snowy River porphyries consisted of beds
of over 1,000 feet in thickness, of the usual fragmental character, with interbedded
sheets of felstone, and that I had noticed that some of the beds had a marked
conglomeratic character, and that nearly all of them included very numerous
fragments of slate, sandstone, and quartzite, of the character of the Lower Silurian
of the district.
Following out the clue thus obtained, I have since that time worked out more in
detail those facts which are observable in the neighborhood of Buchan as bearing

upon this subject. The results of those continued investigations I now propose to
record as a further contribution to our knowledge of the Upper Palaeozoic formations
of North Gippsland.
My previous investigations had led me to believe that the marine limestones of
Buchan rested directly upon the Snowy River porphyries.* I observed, however,
that there seemed to be a small thickness of beds at the base which were not wholly
calcareous, and which, to me, had a littoral character. In tracing out the clue
obtained at the Butcher’s Creek, these views have become greatly altered, and it will
be seen from the succeeding statements that the purely marine limestones of Buchan
form but a moiety of the formation with which they are naturally grouped, and
which they serve to identify as of Middle Devonian age.
butcher’s creek and murendel river.
These two streams rise at uo great distance apart on the Gelantipy table-land.
They flow southwards in deep valleys and join at Murendel, afterwards forming a
junction with the Buchan Eiver.
Commencing with the Butcher’s Creek, the following statements may be made:—
In tracing this stream up or down from the mouth of Gap Creek, the actual base of
the group is not well determinable. This is partly owing to the slight angle of dip
of the beds, the course of the creek being approximately along the strike. It is,
however, probable, as I have shown in the subjoined sketch, that it rests upon the
worn surface of much older felsitic rocks, in fact upon the porphyries of the Snowy
River.
No. 1.—Sketch-section along the course of Butcher’s Creek.
“a.” Massive, rather harsh textured, quartz felsites.
“ b.” A thick mass, without stratification, of rounded or sub-angular felsite blocks,
associated with smaller fragments of all sizes. The whole is in some places
completely massed together, so that structure is almost obliterated. These
felsite fragments narrowly resemble the massive quartz felsites of the district, as
at Black Mountain or G-ellingall.
Between “b” and “c” are beds from 3 to 4 inches in thickness, resembling sand-
stones or grits. The materials forming them are, however, derived from felsitic
rocks, and are either minute grains forming sandstones, or more generally angular
fragments, forming trappean breccias. These beds are clearly aqueously deposited,
and, from the peculiarity of their structure and their constituent materials, strongly
suggest that they are altered tufas.f
* This term is not quite satisfactory to me; but it may serve provisionally to describe a marked feature in the
massive felsites of the Snowy Eiver. These rocks, which are perhaps the most prominent of the group, contain as a
rule free quartz in crystals or crystalline grains. Thus the term is justified. The remainder of the group consists either
of fragmental or compact felsites.
t I use the terms “ tufa ” and “ breccia ”as indicating volcanic materials which have fallen into and been re-arranged
by water; ash and agglomerate are similar materials which have fallen upon land.


“ c.” Breccias containing numerous fragments of slates, and becoming conglo-
meratic in places.
At one place where I observed them forming the base of a cliff they were about
30 feet in thickness ; the upper part of the cliff, for about 50 feet, being rudely
stratified breccias, again followed as it seemed by sandstones more thickly bedded
than those at the base.
“ d.” Yellow and grey compact felsitic beds. In places where these beds have
the appearance of being compact felsites (felstones), the appearances suggest that
there may have been more than one flow, alternating with very finely fragmental
beds (see lithograph plate No. 2, Fig. 7).
We may therefore picture to ourselves that this group rests upon the older
felsitic rocks of the Snowy River, and that it is commenced by a coarse deposit
of large boulders, and angular fragments of felsites of various, but yet always of
highly acid character. These are followed by an alternation of aqueously arranged
sandstones and breccias, composed almost entirely of volcanic materials, some
tufas, and probably one or more sheets of compact felsite. It seems from my
observations that the greater percentage of fragments of sedimentary rocks occur
in the breccias above and not below the sandstones separating “ b ” and “ c.”
No. 2.—Sketch-section at Butcher’s Creek.
“a.” Coarse conglomerate, containing some few rough angular fragments. It
consists mainly of felsites, with fragments of slates and sandstones, resembling those
of the Lower Palaeozoic formations.
“ b.” Thick-bedded breccias, composed of small felsite and slate fragments.
“ c.” Thick-bedded felsitic sandstones and grits.
“ d.” Felsite breccia-conglomerate of rather coarse materials, but with distinct
signs of bedding.
“ e.” Fine breccia-conglomerates similar to “ d.”
“f.” Compact yellow or reddish felsite. It seems to be composed of several
sheets, some of which are only separated from each other by an irregular contact.
The base where visible is very uneven, and conforms to the rises and hollows of the
underlying breccias. I observed in one place that the lower face was vesicular;
the upper surface is nowhere visible, being covered by
“ g.” Basalt.
“ a ” and “ c ” in Section No. 2 may be taken as equivalent to “b ” and “d ” in
Section No 1.
The second section which I obtained at Butcher’s Creek was from about one
mile above the junction of Gap Creek. ( See Sketch-section No. 1.)


No. 3.—Sketch-section from Murendel Creek to Butcher’s Creek.
The above section crosses the Maneroo road about a mile north of Murendel
Hill. Commencing at the Butcher’s Creek, the following description may be
given:—
“a.” Junction of Butcher’s and Gap creeks: Yellow compact or granular
felsitic beds ; these are equivalents of “c ” of Section No. 1 and “d ” of Section
No. 2.
“ b.” Coarse breccia-conglomerates without much trace of bedding, and consisting,
beside the usual felsite fragments, of very numerous rounded or subangular pieces
of slates and sandstones, to all appearance derived from the Lower Palaeozoic
(Silurian) formation of the neighborhood.
“ c.” Similar rocks, but of finer texture, extending to “ d,” where they are
distinctly bedded. The beds are from 6 inches to several feet in thickness, and dip
N. 65° W. at 7° to 10°. The uppermost beds are of a fine texture —resembling a
fine-grained sandstone. In descending order they become coarser, passing into the
breccias and breocia-eonglomorate as at “ e.” They consist mainly of felsitic grains,
of which most are rounded, but a certain percentage is angular. Overlying these
bedded rocks at “d” is the basalt sheet of the Butcher’s Ridges. The lowest part
of the sheet which may be seen resting upon the felsitic sandstones is formed of
rough masses, including numerous scoriaceous and glassy fragments. This basalt
is probably of Middle or Lower-Upper Tertiary age.
“f.” From this point the section crosses to the Maneroo road near the “W”
tree, no other rocks being met with than basalt of the ordinary compact or
vesicular character of the district.
“ g.” In descending into the valley of the Murendel the basalt sheet ceases nearly
at the same level at which it was found to commence in the ascent from Butcher’s
Creek. It is immediately succeeded by limestones, having, among other numerous
marine fossils, the usual and characteristic Spirifera lasvicostata of the Buchan
beds.
The sequence of this group is as follows :—Compact blue limestones of moderate
thickness are followed by thin-bedded limestones, some of which contain a large
percentage of angular felsite fragments, which, in the weathering of the calcareous
beds, stand out in relief. They are deposited either irregularly or in bands.
Underlying these are thick yellow beds, which are in all probability either
decomposed felsites or consolidated felsitic mud. That they are the former, at
least in part, is shown by a slice examined under the microscope, in which the
ordinary structure and composition of a quartz-bearing felsite could be clearly made
out. These rest upon limestones, which are abruptly but conformably succeeded by
thick red beds resembling sandstones. These extend down to


“ h,” where they suddenly cease at harsh granular felsites without bedding or
any visible fragmental structure. These felsites are massive, but traversed
irregularly by two sets of joints, one dipping east at 45°, the second running east
and west, and being vertical.
A cross-section at “g ” is now given, as showing that the limestones extend
some distance north and south, and there end, as delineated, against the massive
harsh felsite common at the Murendel River. The limestones wherever seen
maintain their low angle of dip. Other faults than that shown in Section No. 3
are indicated here.
No. 4. —Sketch-section at Murendel River.
In tracing up and down the Murendel River, from the western end of Section
No. 3, no other rocks were to be observed than the ordinary harsh massive
felsites, with the exception at one spot of compact felsites, which I regarded as
forming part of an intrusive mass.
After carefully examining and considering the beds just described, I conclude
that those at Butcher’s Creek, as their dips indicate, are inferior in position, and
that both portions form part of one series, and as such I have treated them.
We should in that case have here a sequence downwards from limestones of
purely marine origin, through calcareous and felsitic tufas, sandstones, breccias, and
conglomerates, to what is probably a volcanic series of littoral origin.
The total thickness of the group, assuming it to be continuous and that no
portion reappears in each part, might approximately be estimated as follows :

No. 5. —Sketch-section crossing junction of Murendel and Butcher’s Creeks.
Murendel Ck.
The above section I found at the junction of the Butcher’s Creek with the
Murendel River.
“a.” Coarse dark-red breccia, or breccia-conglomerate, some few of the fragments
being rounded, consisting mainly of compact felsite, hut some fragments appearing to
he indurated slate and sandstone, with quartz. No bedding visible ; in the west
side of the stream red sandstones seem to rest upon or even pass down into the
breccia.
“b.” Buff-colored calcareous beds, dipping N. 55° W. at 20°.
R


“ c.” Bluish limestones, showing numerous lines of small felsite fragments,
dipping S.E. at about 15°.
“ d.” Buff-colored calcareous beds, such as those at “ b.” They rise up from
beneath “ c,” and are thin-bedded, dipping S. 80° E. at 10°. These beds are
very full of small felsite fragments, lying in the mass without any definite
direction.
“ e.” Grey crystalline limestone, the dip uncertain but small.
“f.” Ordinary Buchan limestone, commencing near “ e.” The dip probably E.,
at a low angle. The limestones end abruptly at “jfJ” lying at a low angle against the
ordinary harsh quartz felsites of the district, which to the westward rise up into
high hills. In ascending the eastern side of the valley from “a ” the only rocks
met with are similar harsh, massive, and rather granular felsites. In places I
observed in them irregular scoriaceous-looking cavities, but no other distinguishing
characters. I examined this side of the valley, which rises to a great height, for
some miles.
Some two or three miles up Butcher’s Creek from the line of this section I observed
a large mass of intrusive compact felstone which had penetrated the older granular
felsites. Two faults seem to be indicated in this section. One at the western side
of the stream, where the limestones terminate abruptly ; the other perhaps at the
stream, where the peculiar yellow calcareous beds seemed to me to end against the
breccia, or else possibly on the east side of the stream, where the ordinary harsh
felsite commences.
From this place the Murendel River flows in a generally southerly direction to
its junction with the Buchan, and it becomes strikingly evident, on looking down
its valley, that the limestones are confined to the western side, showing a succes-
sion of cliffs and grassy, thinly timbered hills, while the east side of the valley has
the usual rugged and more densely timbered appearance of the tracts where occur
the felsites of this district.
This would receive a sufficient explanation by supposing the existence of an
extensive north and south fault, which has determined the course of the stream,
erosion having been most easy along the contact of the limestones and the felsites.
This suggestion is further confirmed by the occurrence of a well-marked abrupt
line of demarcation on a steep cliff side about a mile down stream from the last
section, and a sketch of which is here given (Fault at Murendel). Lower down
the stream, however, it is evident that the peculiar alternation of high lime-
stone cliffs with lower spurs of felsitic rocks is due to a folding of the strata along
the strike by which the underlying formation is occasionally brought to the surface.
This cliff is about 70 feet in height. The dip ofthe limestone at one end of the
cliff S.W. to S. 60° N. at 18°; at the other end N. 85° W. at 20°. At the base
of the cliff are yellowish or greyish beds, some almost wholly composed of angular
felsitic material, others only containing a few scattered fragments. These frag-
ments are either in bands or irregularly distributed. Above half-way up the cliff
the usual bluish-grey limestones of Buchan come in, but even here some beds
contain numerous felsitic fragments. At the summit are limestones with the usual
characteristic Buchan fossils. Spirifera lasvicostata is even met with in isolated
instances in the lower beds.
To the east of the limestone cliff, and separated from it by a grassy hollow, is a
second cliff of great masses of a rough felsitic rock. It weathers reddish-brown.


VTEW OF FAULT MURENDEL CREEK.


hut on a fresh fracture is greenish. It has then the appearance, when observed
under the lens, of a rather coarse felsitic ash.*
Near the junction of the Murendel with the Buchan, however, other sections
may be seen, which again show features somewhat similar to those already given,
hut with still others added.
The first one which I shall give is taken just below the junction of the Murendel
and Buchan.
No. 7.—Sketch-section across the Buchan Rirer.
“ a.” Massive felsitic rocks, showing in places traces of fragmental structure.
They are grey, cream-colored, or reddish, and weather in rugged blocks or masses.
No bedding is visible.
“ h.” Intrusive basalt. This rock is somewhat variable in physical character.
On the north-eastern side of the section it is compact, and separates into plates
which ring under the hammer, or it is scoriaceous, or including scoriaceons
fragments, in which case it is light-colored. This last variety seems to be subse-
quent in occurrence to the general mass, as it forms a hand some 100 feet in width,
standing up in rough blocks.
“ c.” Thick-bedded, grey, compact, or sub-crystalline limestones, dipping about
S. 60° W. at 27°. Near the upper part of the cliff is an irregular band of greyish
or blackish chert, which in one place has been opened in search of ore. Galena
and green carbonate of copper are sparingly distributed along this cherty band, and
also throughout the mass of the limestone. These ores do not appear, however,
to occur at this locality in quantity or as a well-defined vein or lode.f
In order to ascertain whether any data were to be obtained on the south-western
side of the Buchan basin, I traced up the Tarra Creek, and ascended the Tarra
mountain, but without meeting with any section affording much information. The
mountain seems to consist of various kinds of harsh and massive felsitic rocks, and
at its base the Buchan limestones cease at a point where no rocks are to be
observed at the surface.
The next section which I propose to describe is taken at the Buchan River, near
Mount Dawson.
No. 8.—Sketch-section across Buchan River.
* The cliff figured at page 194 of the former paper must be classed with the Buchan and not with the Snewy
Kiver series.
t Two other sections taken near this place will be found at pages 129 and 181, where they are given in connection
with remarks on the Buchan lead mines.


“ a” Massive felsitic rocks. Here and there fragmental structure may be
recognised.
“ b.” Rocks similar in character, hut earthy in texture ; color greenish, somewhat
coarse in structure, and more included fragments visible.
“ c.” Earthy felsitic rocks, such as those of “ b,” but with more distinct signs of
bedding. Among them are some greyish in color, and including angular and sub-
angular fragments of other felsites of different color and texture. Dip probably
N. 80.° E. at 40°.
“ d.” Following the last are dark-colored to black felsitic breccias or agglomerates,
which continue to “ e,” In this stretch occurs an apparently intrusive, or possibly
contemporaneous sheet of greyish compact felsite (felstone). In places this is
even minutely porphyritic.
“e.” Red felsitic breccia, dip N. 70° E. at 75°, passing from minute fragments
up to pieces of 2 inches diameter, followed by thickly-bedded red breccias, com-
posed of rather small fragments. Part of these beds are rubbly, or earthy. The
band is, as last stated, succeeded by and passes into red, hard, and silicious felsites,
in which the fragmental structure is wholly obliterated. The gradual passage,
apparently by mere alteration, of rocks of this class from a marked fragmental
structure to one indistinguishable from that of many of the hard quartziferous
felsites is often to be suspected, but is here evident.
“f” Succeeding these are fine-grained, rather thickly-bedded, felsitic (trappean)
sandstones, which become at a little further distance jointed, and in appearance
resemble a red and rather sandy shale. Calc-tufa begins at this place to obscure
the surface indications, being deposited by a small creek flowing from the limestone
hills.
“ g.” The first rocks seen here are thin-bedded, fine-grained, calcareous beds,
dipping S.E. at 70°, followed by the ordinary Buchan limestone, dipping S. 30° E.
at 45° to 50°, which then rise in an unbroken series in hills of several hundred
feet in height.
On the west side of the section are high hills of harsh, massive, felsitic rocks.
We have here a departure from the features disclosed by the former section,
in so far that a marked unconformity, indicating a fault, exists between the Buchan
limestone and the older felsites. In former sections it has been evident that the
limestones graduate more or less rapidly and yet conformably downwards into beds,
which are not only calcareous, but which have all the signs of having been accu-
mulated as felsitic and calcareous tufas and breccias, and which are in places
associated with probably contemporaneous flows of felsites. Unconformity in those
instances has been with the older and generally more massive felsites. In this section,
however, the rocks with which the limestones show such a marked unconformity consist
of beds which exhibit both a fragmental structure and aqueous arrangement, while
the alteration in their physical and mineral condition has proceeded to greater lengths
than I have observed in the lower portion of the Buchan group at the Murendel or
Butcher’s Creek. But it is less by far than that common, or even I may say
universal, in the more ancient felsites of the Snowy River. I incline to regard the
beds “a” to “f” as belonging, probably, to an earlier period than that to which
the Murendel beds might be referred.
The next illustration to be taken is from Gellingall, which is situated on the
Buchan River, some miles up stream from the site of the last section.


Gellingall is one of the small limestone basins which occur in the district lying
deep among surrounding hills of felsites, granites, or Lower Palaeozoic sedimentary
rocks. I have briefly referred to this place in the former paper on the subject.
No. 9.—Sketch-section at Sheepwash Creek, Gellingall.
This section commences in the Sheepwash Creek, about a mile above the crossing
of the Glenmore track.
“ a.” Ordinary ternary granite of the district. Lying upon this is a coarse
breccia, consisting of varieties of felsites. The component fragments are of various
dimensions up to 18 inches diameter. Among them I observed a block of granite
about 2 feet across. The breccia is not only firmly bound together by silicious cement,
but seems in places even to pass into the mass of the granite. A careful examina-
tion of the surface where this very peculiar appearance shows itself led me to
believe that the seeming passage is due merely to the filling in by the felsitie
breccia of an extremely uneven granite surface. Subsequent induration has
welded both formations completely together.
The upper part of this breccia at “ b” is finer, but it is so completely silioified in
places that the structure is obliterated, and where the outlines of the fragments are
lost it looks like a compact felsite,
“ c.” Compact to fine-grained beds of 18 to 24 inches in thickness; dip
S.4O°E. at 15°.
“d.” Similar beds, but not more than 6 to 12 inches thick, and of coarser
material.
“ e.” Thick-bedded and rather coarser than “ d,” but not so coarse as to become
a breccia like “ b.” These beds are all of felsitie materials and extend to “g.”
They are silicifled and contain among the smaller angular particles some larger
pieces of from 1 to 2 feet diameter. *
“ h.” A large diabase dyke crosses the beds at this place. It is about 30 feet in
width, and most probably has a dip N. 80° E. at 80°.
“ i.” Thick beds, dipping S. 30° E. at 13°, now assume the ordinary appearance
of sandstones, and show well-marked instances of false bedding, which is nowhere
observable in the earlier deposits. In the finer portions of these stratified sediments
occur a few rounded pebbles, also, so far as I know, the first instance of this in the
ascending series. These beds in fact have a marked difference from the earlier
ones in being distinctly stratified sediments and in the component particles being
rounded.
“ k.” Resting upon these thick sandstones is a peculiar band of igneous rock of
porphyritic granular composition. It is of a reddish color, and wherever seen is
much decomposed and earthy. From its general appearance it most probably
belongs to one of the varieties of less silicated felsites. The surface has probably
been originally irregular and uneven, and this points to contemporaneous origin.
It may be from 5 to 10 feet, or even more, in thickness locally. Resting upon


it are several narrow bands of clayey or rubbly material, seemingly derived from its
abraded upper surface. Some of these bands have a calcareous appearance, and
effervesce with dilute hydrochloric acid.
“ I.” Overlying these regularly are rather thin yellow calcareous beds, in which
is a band of blackish chert. Dip of these beds about S.E., at a low angle.
At this point there occurs a fault, the rocks now described ceasing and being
succeeded by a series of limestones bearing the characteristic Buchan marine fossils.
These beds show themelves in the creek as compact bluish limestones, followed by
compact grey calcareous beds, and again succeeded by grey or bluish rather crystal-
line limestones, with many minute included fragments of felsites. Above these are
the usual grey or blue Buchan limestones. These rise up into hills of about two
hundred feet in altitude, and have a general low dip to the S.E.
About a mile lower down the Sheepwash Creek, and close to the Gellingall
homestead, I obtained a second interesting section.
No. 10.—Sketch-section at Gellingall.
This section commences on the high ridge separating the Shoepwash Creek from
the Buchan River, and crosses the little open forest basin in which the Gellingall
homestead is situated.
“ a.” Massive felsites, such as are seen in the Buchan River valley from the
mouth of Sheepwash Creek upwards. In places faint shapes of included fragments
may be traced. Bedding is nowhere visible, and the general character is that of a
compact quartz felsite (see lithograph plate No. 2, Fig. 9).
“ b.” Compact bluish limestones, in beds of from 6 to 18 inches, dipping
S. 70° E. at 21°.
“ c.” Thick-bedded blue limestones, dipping S. 70° E. at 18°.
“ d.” Alternating thick and thin bedded bluish limestones, dipping as at “ c.”
These extend down to “ e,” where they form a cliff of about 30 feet in height, and
thence downwards to “f” where is a band of blackish or greyish chert, about 3 feet
in thickness.
“ g.” The chert band is succeeded by yellowish calcareous beds, 12 to 18 inches
thick, which rest upon a thick mass of reddish porphyritic felsite, similar to
that referred to in the preceding section.
On crossing the Sheepwash Creek and ascending the opposite side of the valley
these two last well-individualized beds, the chert and the granular felsite, can be
traced, either the one or the other, as forming the surface of the slope, until rocks
are met with having the aspect of the thick beds “ i,” of Section No. 9. On


crossing the hills lying between the Sheepwash Creek and the Tambarra Eiver,
similar rocks show themselves for some distance, ending at granite. The general
succession and relation of the rocks of this tract may he generalized as in Sketch-
section No, 11.
The granular felsite sheet and the chert band serve to connect the two
sections.
No. 11. —Sketch-section from Sheepwash Creek to the Tambarra River.
In the Gellingall basin the same features therefore exist that are shown in the
former sections from Murendel and Buchan. We may not unfairly consider that we
have at Gellingall a view of the whole group as it now remains—from the underly-
ing granite on which its base rests to the limestones of purely marine origin with
which the series terminates, and which, up to the present time, have been mainly
the representatives of Middle Devonian formations here.
The Buchan limestones are therefore only a part of a continuous series. The
lower part of the group consists of coarsely aggregated felsitic breccias, the
coarseness of material decreasing, but with alternations in texture, in ascending.
The deposits also become more distinctly bedded, and in places, as at
Butcher’s Creek, pass into, or alternate with subordinate conglomerates, in which
angular or rounded fragments of sedimentary rocks are of common occurrence.
In all the late and in many of the earlier beds aqueous arrangement is clearly
distinguishable. The coarse angular breccias at the base indicate, I think, a
shore line.
In all the sections occur felsite sheets, which as a rule are compact, and are
found under conditions which almost always suggest that they are of contempora-
neous origin.
The passage beds are compounds, in varying percentages, of limestone and felsitic
particles, the latter varying in dimensions from mere dust to several inches in
diameter. The felsitic admixture gradually, or in places suddenly ceases, and
the remaining beds of the group are then purely limestones of the ordinary
character seen at Buchan, and characterized by a numerous marine fauna of
Devonian age.
It may be added that the felsitic particles which are found diffused throughout
the passage beds, not only in their physical appearance, suggest that they are
particles of ejected volcanic materials, but are shown by quantitative analysis to
have the normal constitution of a quartz felsite, if we regard them as trappean,
or of a rock allied to quartz trachyte, if we compare them to the more acid
class of modern lavas.
It may, I think, be possible to estimate provisionally the character and thickness
of the Devonian formations of North Gippsland. Other interesting sections, of the

existence of which I am aware, but which I have not yet found occasion to examine,
will not, I anticipate, materially alter this estimate or narrow the conclusions which
it may he possible to draw.
For the upper groups the mean of my former estimates of the Snowy Bluff beds
has been taken.* The thickness of the Buchan limestones has been estimated from
the elevation of hills near the Murendel and Buchan rivers, all allowances being
made for the probable amount and alternation of dips.
The Snowy River porphyries have been estimated by their thickness as shown
in the natural section of the Little Eiver near Woolgoolmerang. Their base is not
even there disclosed, and as it is only locally that they have any regular bedding,
the height given by aneroid has been used.
The Middle Devonian formation of Tabberabbera has not been considered in this
estimate. It is the only one of this age which has undergone extensive foldings,
such as have elsewhere affected the Older Palaeozoic strata. Its limits are at
present undefined, and much of it probably extends underneath the nearly horizontal
Upper Devonian conglomerates and grits of Iguana Creek. Although it is marked
at Tabberabbera by a band of limestone and other well-individualized fossiliferous
beds, these do not, so far as I know, recur. Data are therefore wanting to estimate
the thickness of this group. I think, however, it is probably of greater dimensions
than that at Buchan.
In considering what may be the conclusion to be fairly drawn from the preceding
statements, it would appear necessary, in the first place, to separate all the lower
part of this group, namely, the fragmental and sedimentary beds, from the Snowy
River porphyries, with which I have previously classed them. This would, how-
ever, leave a vast tract untouched of the massive mountain-forming felsites of
Gelantipy, the Black Mountain, and Wombargo, together with the compact felsites
(felstones) and the fragmental rocks (agglomerates) which are found associated with
them there. The latter group is indicated by “ a,” section No. 10, and probably
more or less by “ g,” section No. 3 ; “ a,” section No. 5; 1, section No. 6 j and “ a,”
“ b,” “ c,” “ d” “ e,” “/,” of section No. 7.
A well-marked distinction may be drawn as to position, structure, and physical
and mineral condition between the Buchan group, using this term in its compre-
hensive sense, and the vast porphyritic masses from which it is generally found to
be separated by faults, as shown in the given sections.
• Keport ol Progress ol tbe Geological Surrey of Victoria, Part IV., p. 77.


After carefully examining the localities now described, together with much of
the country adjoining them, I still believe the discordance between the Buchan
group, as now defined, and the Snowy River porphyries to be as great as I formerly
indicated, and that therefore the latter may possibly be Lower Devonian.
The general conditions indicated are, I think, these :
1. A sinking coast-line, with either marine or littoral volcanoes, from which
trachytic materials were ejected as fragments or emitted as flows of lava
(felsite breccias, tufas, compact and porphyritio felsites).
2. Gradual extinction of volcanic activity, as indicated by the finer character
of the felsite fragments, their intermixture with calcareous materials (calca-
reous felsite tufas), and their final cessation, with succession of purely marine
limestones.
We have therefore evidence of the occurrence of volcanic activity in the Middle
Devonian age, and thus of its continuance from the earlier Devonian times of the
Snowy River porphyries to the Upper Devonian felsites of Tabberabbera, Maxi-
milian Creek, and the Snowy Bluff.
The gradual spread of marine conditions over the Buchan and Gellingall area
would therefore suggest previous terrestrial conditions, and I think probably situated
to the north or north-west. The Tabberabbera beds suggest also proximity of land,
while the Iguana Creek beds speak of it in the plainest language in the numerous
fossil plants alone found in them.
Hence we may conclude that the Devonian age was in North Gippsland a period
characterised by the occurrence of vast volcanic manifestations, which were most
probably terrestrial.
The Lead Mines of Buchan.
I have in the former part of my paper on the Devonian rocks of North Gipps-
land referred shortly to the occurrence of galena at Buchan. In working out the
present details my attention has been directed to the various ore deposits in con-
nection with the Buchan beds; and it has become evident to me that an investi-
gation into their mode of occurrence, their origin, and their connection with the
containing rocks, as well as into their economic value, would be of interest.
It is not necessary for me to describe in detail all the places where ore has been
found. No useful purpose would thereby be served, nor would the details, so far
as I know, add any information to the data procurable at the two mines which have
been to a slight extent already opened and explored.
THE BACK CREEK MINE.
This mine, which is now completely abandoned, is situated at the Back Creek,
and about 30 chains from the
Buchan River. The subjoined
section will afford details as to
the position of the mine in
respect to the containing forma-
tions.

stones, weathering brown. Dip W. at 14°.
s


“ b.” Chert band.
“ c.” Dyke of basalt. At this spot is situated the deserted Back Creek mine.
“ d.” The beds on the south-west side of the dyke are all limestones, with a
general dip to the north-east of about 30° to 45°. At “ e,” however, the dip changes
to W. at 16°, and the limestones almost immediately cease, and are followed by
calcareous fragmental beds of the usual brecciated character seen in this district.
Similar rocks, for instance, at “ e ” and “f” extend to “ g,” where they abruptly
terminate at a mass of basalt. The beds “e” and “f” are more felsitic and less
calcareous in descending.
The basalt is highly altered from its normal character, as met with on the east
side of the Buchan River, where it adjoins massive felsites. At the contact with
the limestones it is either dark-blue, with irregular light-colored specks, which
effervesce with dilute hydrochloric acid, or, where weathered, and the carbonates
thus removed, is seen to be full of irregular cavities, which give it a scoriaceous
appearance. When blocks are freshly broken, these cavities are found to be filled
either by various carbonates, or by red Jasper, or by Jasper and chalcedony, or more
rarely quartz. In fact, in many places, the masses and veins of Jasper form a
peculiar and marked feature in this rock. It must be remarked that such pecu-
liarities are to be seen all along the line of contact of the limestone and basalt, but
not, so far as I know, along the contact of the felsites and basalt.
Adjoining the limestone the basalt has been converted into a rock which can
only be classed mineralogically as a melaphyr ; adjoining the felsites it is still a
basalt. If it is intrusive and of Tertiary age, as seems not improbable considering
the neighboring vast basaltic flows to the northward, we should then have the
anomaly of a Tertiary melaphyr; if, on the contrary, it should prove to be
pre-Tertiary in age, then we should have a pre-Tertiary basalt. We have here
exactly an instance of the inconvenience of the present petrographical classification
to which I drew attention in a previous paper.
“ h.” The basalt extends nearly to the mouth of the Back Creek, where felsitic
rocks of the character generally met with east of the Murendel River come in, and
thus indicate, as I believe, the presence of the fault on which I think that river
flows.
The features disclosed by this section accord with- those already illustrated.
From “a”to“ e” we have the Buchan limestones; from “e” to “g” the calcareous
breccias, or tufas; “c” and “g” appear to represent the position of fault, for, as
regards “ c,” the brecciated beds do not occur on both sides of the dyke, nor do they
reappear to the west in the section. The basalt seems to have come up along
faults, and, looking at it in the mass, it conforms to this view throughout its occur-
rence at the Murendel and Buchan rivers.
At the Back Creek mine the ore is not found in a true lode, but in irregular
bunches and strings in the bedding planes of the limestones, as well as disseminated
in grains throughout not only the calcareous but also the adjoining felsitic rocks.
The shaft sunk in following the ore forms an irregular opening, dipping to the
S.W. at 12° to 15°. A dyke shows in the shaft passing through the limestones,
and it seems to have followed a fault. It is much decomposed, and in places it, as
well as the containing walls, bears some radiated pyrites. It does not carry galena,
although, so far as I could ascertain, that ore is met with in the bedding planes of
the rocks on either side of it. This might be held to indicate that the dyke is of


subsequent age to the ore vein, but I think that I shall he able to show reasons
against this belief. In examining the two sides of the small gully in which the
Back Creek flows, there are indications of an east and west fault, for a dyke shows
on the north side which is similar in every respect to the one just mentioned,
although discordant with it by an apparent horizontal shift of about 50 feet.
An adit was driven for some distance in the decomposed dyke, under the impres-
sion that it would prove to be a true lode. This belief was not confirmed, and was
not indeed justified by the conditions.
No machinery was erected at this mine.
The following information has been obligingly furnished to me by Mr. H. Rich,
formerly manager of the Back Creek mine :
“ The amount of ore raised may be estimated at from 180 to 200 tons, including all
kinds raised during the progress of the work ; 70 to 80 tons of this quantity was of
good quality, say from 45 to 55 per cent., and it was not dressed in any way, but just
as broken out ; the balance of the ore would probably yield from 14 to 16 per cent.
This quantity of ore raised was only that obtained during the prosecution of works
confined solely to the object of testing the continuation of the lead deposits to the
greatest depths from the surface. During this a large amount of hard work was
done, with the object of intersecting a bed of ore at the lowest depth practicable
by tunnelling, and from which no ore was raised.
“ The limestone beds did not preserve the same angle of dip as that calculated,
and their continued flatness necessarily gave much more driving to intersect them.
The country was extremely hard, costing upwards of £5 per foot, and progress
was therefore slow.
“ Speaking from memory, the analyses, which I cannot now place my hands on,
gave, as the best results, from 70 to 74 per cent, of lead, and from 18 to 42 oz. of
silver per ton of lead. The ore consisted chiefly of steely galena, some carbonate
and oxide, antimony, and iron.
. “ I sent a little over 50 tons to Melbourne, some of which was smelted at the
antimony works, Collingwood, which I think realized only about 38 per cent.”
THE MURENDEL MINE.
This mine is situate close to the Murendel River, not far above its junction with
the Buchan. It is on a mineral lease, and has been worked by the Murendel Silver
Lead Mining Company (Limited). So far as lam aware, this company is now in
a moribund or defunct condition, and the works have been discontinued for some
time. In September last I visited the locality, and obtained the following par-
ticulars. The subjoined section will illustrate the features of the locality :
No. 13.—Sketch-section at the Murendel River.


“ a.” Intrusive basalt. This mass appears to be connected with that shown in
the Back Creek section, but it does not immediately adjoin this mine. It is only
affected by the usual surface alterations, and does not show the peculiar melaphyr
character seen when in contact with the limestone.
“ b.” Fragmental felsite rocks ; occasionally having signs of bending. These
are overlaid conformably but abruptly, by
“ c.” Buchan limestone.
“ d." Massive felsite. Harsh to the touch, and where weathered showing irre-
gular but narrow horizontal cavities. More rarely yellow or grey, and then
compact ; or else purple, with small porphyritic patches of felspar. They are
generally quartziferous. A fault separates them from “c” and “ b,” with the
latter of which they bear hut slight resemblance, if any.
In examining this mine I observed that the ore, as at Back Creek, follows the
bedding of the limestones, penetrates crevices in them, or is disseminated in crys-
talline grains and spangles throughout the mass of the rock. The mine has been
opened by an underlay shaft at about 50 yards from the river, and follows down
the trend of the ore vein. At the time of my visit it was full of water to within
20 feet of the surface, and was therefore inaccessible to me. The upper part of
the workings showed details which I have roughly given in the subjoined
sketch:—
No. 14.—Diagram of Murendel Mine.
The limestones dip W. at 20° to 25°. The ore occurs in the bedding planes in “a.”
These beds are cut off by “ c,” which I regard as a fault, filled at the surface by a
mingled mass of clay and limestone fragments.
Mr. S. Preston, who has been for nearly four years the manager of this mine,
obligingly accompanied me over the works, and to him I am indebted for the
following information :
“In following the underlay shaft the ore continued in the bedding and joints of
the limestone, until the beds were cut off by a mass of fragments cemented by
various ores, and about 7to 8 feet in thickness. This was backed by a smooth
hanging wall. The best ore followed down this wall, being about 5 feet wide. At
about 70 feet depth* the width of the lode was about 5 feet, and its strike north
and south. This was ascertained by driving along it for 30 feet. The dip re-
mained constant to about 60 feet, where it became more vertical.
“ The ore in this lode is in strings, bunches, and in the joints. At the surface
there was no mundic, only iron-ore and galena ; hut below the water-level, at about
50 feet depth, mundic came in. At this depth, also, the hanging wall became well
defined, cutting off the limestone beds. It was nowhere broken through in the
workings. The foot wall is slaty in character.
* About 30 to 40 leet in vertical depth.


“ It was observed in following down tbe ore that, where the vein was hard and
crystalline, it became barren; where the vein stone was dark and jointed, the ore
increased in amount.
“The mine when working made about 1,000 gallons of water per shift.
“About twenty yards to the west of the mine a shaft was sunk for 60 feet
through hard grey crystalline limestone, which was much disturbed, and without
any regular bedding.
“ The plant at the mine consists of a Flintshire furnace, capable of smelting three
charges, of 21 cwt. each, in 24 hours ; but the dirty nature of the ore prevented
more being dealt with at a time than about 17 cwt. as a charge. At the same
time it must be said that 21 cwt. of clean ore has been smelted.
“ There is an 8-horse power tubular engine, an ore-breaking machine, sluice-box
for cleaning the ore from clay, and two jigging sieves.
“ Before erecting the present furnace the company had an American ore
hearth, and a Spanish reverberatory furnace, neither of which proved to be satis-
factory.
“ The results of smeltings varied much. In one of the earliest smeltings with
the present furnace, made in December 1874, 5 tons of ore only yielded 16 cwt.
of lead. The last smelting was on 15th January 1877, when six charges of 17 cwt.
each were operated upon, giving 25 pigs of lead from the first lot, and 24 pigs of
lead from the last. The ore was all that then remained at grass, and contained
much scrapings.
“From Ist May 1876 to the time of ceasing operations in 1877 the total amount
smelted was 74 tons of ore, yielding 482 pigs of lead. Each pig weighed about
112 lbs.”
Besides the above information afforded by Mr. Preston, it must be noted that an
extensive brick flue and stack has been erected at the furnace, and extending I
think some 400 feet from the mine.
The examination which I personally made at the mine showed me that the ore
vein worked is connected with a fault which has traversed the limestones imme-
diately adjoining their abrupt contact with the underlying fragmental felsite beds.
It has all the appearances of a true lode filling a fault, the gangue being a lime-
stone breccia cemented by carbonate of lime and metallic sulphides.
I observed that the limestones to the east of the mine were immediately followed
by felsite rocks, while on the west side were hard grey crystalline limestones. A
shaft shows that these descend at least to 60 feet, which would be considerably
below the depth vertically to which the mine has been carried. As no felsite beds
were met with, this indicates a down-throw in the west side of the fault.
In order to obtain a further insight into the relations of these rocks, I carefully
examined the Murendel Eiver for about a mile above the mine.
At the point where the western fault, shown in the section, crosses the river, I
found the contact of the limestones and the harsh massive felsites to be very irre-
gular. The former were without apparent bedding, grey in color, contorted,
splintery, and crystalline. In following down the river from this point, the contact
of the greyish-blue limestone beds with the underlying felsites became immediately
evident, the dip being S. 15« E. at about 1S Q . This contact is well shown in a


series of cliffs along the river. The limestones, as I have before said, are con-
formable to the felsitic rocks, which latter are only rarely rudely bedded. Between
the two sets of beds there is a thin shaly parting, and the contact not only dips
towards the west as a rule, and at a low angle, but is more or less undulated with
the strike. In examining the felsite rocks by means of a lens, on a fresh surface
of fracture, it is seen that it is composed of angular or slightly-rounded felsite frag-
ments, imperfect felspar crystals, and some quartz grains. The texture is rather
coarse than fine, and it has all the appearance of a somewhat coarse felsite
“ pepperino. ” I think that these
beds may be regarded as the represen-
tatives of the Lower Buchan beds of
Butcher’s Creek and Gellingall, but
without the passage-beds which there
connect the two members of the Middle
Devonian group.
The following sketch shows the re-
lation of these rocks :
In following round the contact of
the basalt with the limestones from
the mine at the Back Creek to the
Murendel mine, it is evident that all
the ore deposits which have been dis-
covered and partly opened lie more or
less along it; whilst on the east side,
No. 15.—Sketch of Cliff near Murendel River.
where the basalt is in contact with the felsitic rocks, no ore deposits have been, so
far as I am aware, found. Alongside the limestones the basalt has been so ex-
tensively altered that it has become a melaphyr, whilst it maintains its character
unaltered on the east side along the felsites. Moreover, there would seem to be a
connection between the basalt and the occurrence of ore, and relations connecting
the galena veins and faults.
The data which I have as yet collected are insufficient to determine whether
the basalt is intrusive or is anterior wholly or in part to the limestones. The
appearances I have observed at the Murendel suggest the former, while those at
Back Creek point rather to the latter supposition. At present, regarding the
basalt at the Murendel as intrusive, the following considerations suggest themselves.
If the basalt was intrusive it seems probable that it would be connected with heated
waters. Whether these thermal waters were directly associated with it, or merely
became heated on reaching it by percolation downwards from the surface, would not
affect the question. The association of the sulphides of iron, lead, copper, and zinc,
which are found in these mines, with minerals which evidently owe their genesis to
the intervention of water, such as calcite or barite, necessitates that we should attribute
to the metallic sulphides a similar origin, and we may further conclude that they were
precipitated from the condition of sulphates. If we therefore picture to ourselves that,
at the time of the irruption of the basalt, chemical waters holding metallic sulphates
in solution percolated through the rock masses, finding their passage, especially by
the planes of bedding, by joints and dislocations, as well as generally permeating
the strata, we shall perceive that, coming into contact with the highly fossiliferous
and often bituminous limestones, the sulphates would become reduced through the


oxidation of organic substances, tbe result being tbe precipitation of sulphides of
the metals and the generation of carbonic acid and water.
Other reactions may then easily be supposed to follow. The ore veins being
thus generated, the waters holding free carbonic acid would, where permeating the
limestones, dissolve carbonate of lime, while, on the other hand, in the basalts, the
silicates would be decomposed, and iron, lime, magnesia, and the alkalies, would be
removed as carbonates. Ultimately, so far as these reactions penetrated into the
basaltic mass, its mineral structure and composition would be greatly altered. An
examination of thin slices of the rock under the microscope shows that not only have
individual minerals been removed, but that the ground mass surrounding them has
been extensively affected. Irregular cavities have been formed, which are now
filled in by carbonates, and by those chloritic silicates which may be generally
classed under the term “ Yiridite,” as proposed by Professor Strong. In some less
altered examples, hematite pseudomorphs after crystals of olivine are still recog-
nizable. We have here, so far as the alterations of the basalt are concerned,
changes similar in character to those which I have observed and described as
occurring in the Devonian basalt of the Snowy Bluff (melaphyr). In both cases
the changes may be referred, with much probability of truth, to the action of
heated water under pressure. But there is one marked distinction. In the basalts
of the Snowy Bluff the changes have been the decomposition of the original
silicates and the recomposition (probably during the cooling down of the rock
masses) of a new class of silicates, which, on the whole, seem to be, as we might
expect, of a more stable character than those that were decomposed —as, for in-
stance, pistacite. The changes which have taken place at Back Creek have been
the decomposition of the original silicates, and the recomposition, to a less degree,
of a new class of silicates, which, together with carbonates, have been deposited in
the resulting cavities. In the first case the secondary minerals are almost wholly
silicates, in the second case they are mainly carbonates. Further, at Back Creek,
there has been an elimination of much silica and iron, which now exists as red jasper
and chalcedony throughout the altered basalt. These differences may, I think, be
fairly attributed to the different character of the stratified rocks associated with
the igneous masses. Those at the Snowy Bluff are highly siliceous and aluminous,
while those at Back Creek are as highly or even more highly calcareous
The application of these conclusions to the Buchan mines seems to me to be
evident. The ore deposits may be directly connected with reactions set up by the
intrusion of basalt in certain cases in the calcareous rock masses, and with other
reactions in the igneous rocks ; and the intrusion of the basalt, if intrusive, as well
as the deposition of ore in certain veins, has, it seems, been influenced by the
existence of numerous faults. If, on the other hand, it should prove that the
basalt is not intrusive, but contemporaneous, or of anterior age, then I conceive
that the processes which have taken place must be referred to a form of
metamorphism such as has affected allied rooks at the Snowy Bluff. At Back
Creek, the fault, which apparently cut the vein and was then injected by basalt,
had, I conceive, a previous existence. The appearances of subsequent age of
the dyke may be accounted for by the supposition that the intrusion of the
igneous rock and the deposit of the ore were directly connected, and were therefore
contemporaneous. The decomposition of the dyke stone and its impregnation by
pyrites is of quite recent date, and may be referred to the percolation of surface


water holding in solution oxygen, carbonic acid, and, according to the late researches
of Mr. J. C. Newbery, also the acid carbonate of ammonia. It is not therefore
probable that galena will be found in connection with the dyke, which I anticipate
would be found to be undecomposed at a greater depth than that to which the work-
ings have been carried. At the Murendel mine slightly different conditions obtain.
The basalt is at a little distance. Two faults have let down a tract of limestone
into the felsite rocks underlying it. The eastern fault is immediately adjoining the
base of these limestones. The east wall of the fault would be therefore composed
entirely, in all probability, of the Lower Buchan beds, while the western wall
would consist of the Upper Buchan beds (limestones). What the down-throw has
been is not ascertainable, and the depth to which the western wall would carry
calcareous rock is uncertain. Upon this would, however, depend, on the principles
which I have sketched out, to what depth the galena deposits would reach. I
think that they would certainly cease so soon as both sides of the fault came to
be formed of the felsite beds.
The fault at the Murendel mine has not, like that at Back Creek, been injected
by basalt, but appears to me to show the existence of a true lode, the gangue being
a limestone breccia cemented by carbonates and metallic sulphides. The actual
value, economically, of the lode, can only be ascertained by its systematic examina-
tion and exploration.
Up to the present time this has not been done. Most of the capital and energy
of the company seem heretofore to have been expended in erecting smelting
works, and generally doing much in bricks and mortar. The actual development of
the lode by mining has been thus neglected. If at any future time operations are
resumed by any other company at this place, the exploration of the mine should be
the first work carried out.
In a legitimate mining adventure this would be the proper and reasonable course.
It might prove the mine to be of great extent and value ; but, on the other hand,
it might prove it to be of little value. In the latter case, such operations would be
entirely destructive of any merely speculative intentions, such as have too univer-
sally attended mining of all kinds in North Gippsland.
APPENDIX.
NOTES ON THE EXMINATION OF ROCK SAMPLES COLLECTED TO ILUSTRATE THE
CHARACTERS OF THE BUCHAN BEDS.
1. In order to test the accuracy of the conclusion arrived at in the field as to the
nature and amount of the fragments observable as being included in some of the
lower beds of the limestones of Buchan and Murendel, an average example collected
from near the Murendel Hill (Sec. No. 3, g ) was roughly broken up and treated
with dilute hydrochloric acid. The carbonates being thus dissolved out, the re-
mainder was washed, dried, and weighed, giving 29-20 per cent, of the whole


amount of rock. Under the lens these fragments showed rough and angular or
else somewhat rounded forms. They were generally cavernous, and in one or two
I observed hemispherical cavities exactly resembling the vesicles occurring in
Recent Volcanic rocks. The colors were grey or reddish. The texture was mostly
compact, but more rarely slightly granular, and occasional bright facets as of quartz
were to be seen.
A portion of this residue was subjected to a quantitative examination, giving the
following results :
Silica ... ... ... ... 79"62
Alumina ... ... ... ... 9 - 99
Ferric oxide ... ... ... ... 3-22
Lime ... ... ... ... -37
Magnesia ... ... ... ... ’22
Potash ... ... ... ... 3 - 94
Soda ... ... ... ... 2-64
100-00*
These percentages are in accord with the constitution of the most acid class of
Ancient Volcanic rocks—quartz felsitesj —or of the recent class, quartz
A reference to the microscopic examination of the volcanic ash tufas and quartz
felsites of this group will show further that the above percentage of soda receives
an explanation through the occurrence in all of these rocks of subordinate triclinic
felspars.
The mode of occurrence, the physical characters, and the chemical constitution
of these fragments, point, I think, unmistakably to their being volcanic lapilli.
Other examples taken from the base, from half way up, and from the summit of the
cliff, sketched near No. 5, were treated as above, and gave 31 - 79, 11-17, 1"50 per
cent, of fragments respectively. These, when examined under a low power (about
25 linear), accorded in character with those already described.
2. Butcher's Creek. —Section 1 c.
A thin slice examined under the microscope by ordinary light has the appear-
ance of having a compact felsitic base, in which are great numbers of imperfect
crystals, or crystalline grains of quartz and felspar. Polarized light, however,
causes the structure to become evident, and it is then seen to be entirely com-
posed of minute angular fragments of felsite, of monoclinic felspar, and many
fractured grains of quartz. A little felsitic-looking base cements the whole into a
mass. The fragments are not only arranged with an approximately similar direction,
hut are further arranged in hands. This slice was cut perpendicular to the appa-
rent bedding of the rocks.
3. This example was taken from a bed underlying the last. In texture it re-
sembled a moderately fine sandstone.
* The total percentages amounted to 101*58, from which the above was calculated,

A thin slice showed it to consist of angular fragments of —
(1.) Felsite and fine felsite ash or tufa.
(2.) Orthoclase.
(3.) Quartz.
(4.) Plagioclase.
The fragments are cemented by a little dark-colored felsitic paste. — {See Litho-
graphic Plate No. 2, Fig. 8.)
4. From the seemingly Felsite Sheet at the mouth of Gap Creek. — Sec. 1 d.
These rooks vary in character from a compact to a granular grey or yellowish felsite-
I found it impossible to decide from the occurrence of the rocks in situ whether
they were contemporaneous volcanic or fragmental ; in other words, lavas, or ash,
or tufas.
A thin slice, however, showed that the compact variety is in fact a fragmental
compound. The amount of felsitic paste preponderates so much, and the alteration
which has taken place has been so great, that the outlines of the scattered frag-
ments are rarely, if at all, visible by ordinary light. By polarized light, however,
they at once start out into individuality.—( See Lithograph Plate No. 2, Fig. 7.)
The more granular variety almost exactly reproduces the characters of 3.
5. This example was taken from what seemed like a massive quartz felsite,
immediately underlying the beds from which the samples last described were taken.
Examined as a thin slice, it proved equally with them to have been fragmental.
In this case, however, the fragments seemed to have been mainly derived from
orthoclase felspars, and among them a few individuals showing distinct triclinic
striation. The felsitic paste is dark and cloudy. In this magnetite occurs.
6. Section No. 3 d.
This was a sample of the vitreous masses forming the foot or base of the basalt
sheet. This is a volcanic glass of a pale golden-brown. It contains—
(l.) Very numerous crystals in more or less perfect stages of development.
A few larger ones are clearly distinguishable both by their shape and
optical characters as olivine, and individuals of decreasing magnitude
connect them with numerous granules, which are scattered about either
singly or in groups.
(2.) Mere rhomboidal outlines, which disappear when the prisms are crossed,
and which are not otherwise individualised.
(3.) A few long, narrow twin prisms, having plane terminations. These
may be plagioclase.
(4.) Yery numerous minute microlites, either merely acicular or having
forked or ragged terminations.
(5.) A few included glass masses, which disappear where the prisms are
crossed, and finally a few gas bubbles.
This basaltic glass is but slightly attacked by long continued digestion with
hydrochloric acid, and would therefore come under the definition of Hyalomelane
rather than Tachylite.* —( See Lithograph Plate No. 2, Fig. 1.)
* Kosenbusch. Mikroskopische Physiographic der Petrographisch Wichtigen Mmeralien, p. 183.


7. This sample was taken from the edge of the basalt sheet overlooking the
valley of the Murendel in Section 3 g.
It has a semi-crystalline ground mass of—
(1.) Plagioclase prisms irregularly grouped.
(2.) Aggregations of pale-brown augite granules.
(3.) Rather larger grains of olivine.
The interspaces are filled in by magnetite and by a rather dark-green glass.
In this ground mass are larger and in places well-formed olivine crystals; but they
are, without exception, more or less affected by alteration which has followed
irregular flaws and cracks. A yellowish or brownish serpentinous substance has
been produced. This may also be seen in the ground mass, and may thus perhaps
indicate the former position of small olivine grains. A characteristic example is
figured in Lithograph Plate No. 2, Fig. 3.
8. This felsite, when examined under the microscope as a thin slice, has cha-
racters which recall both the true felsites and the regenerated felsite tufas or ash
of the Butcher’s Creek.
The ground mass of this rock is felsitic, and it shows distinct fluid structure ;
but the fractured and angular shapes of the contained felspars and quartz, and the
manner in which they are arranged, strongly resemble the structure of the frag-
mental rocks already described. Magnetite grains and crystals also occur. In this
instance the microscopic examination favors the belief that this also may be merely
a regenerated felsite ash or tufa rather than a true quartz felsite.
9. This example was taken from the thick compact yellow beds occurring at
g, Sec. 2. The appearance of these beds seen in situ simulated that of a felsite
sheet, but a thin slice showed that the rock is composed entirely of fragments of
felsite, felspar, and quartz, set in a dark-colored felsitic paste ; this latter is dark-
colored in consequence of the ferruginous infiltration which has affected all these
beds. This band is therefore clearly not a felsite, but a regenerated ash or tufa
similar in character to those of the Butcher’s Creek.
10. Section 9 c, Gelling all.
This rock is composed entirely of light-grey to almost white felsite and quartz,
in small angular grains, set in a felsitic paste. By ordinary light the structure is
scarcely recognizable or to be distinguished from an ordinary example of compact
felstone. By polarized light, however, the fragments at once stand out from each
other. It presents no peculiarities to be noted, and is of the same class evidently as
those beds already described at Butcher’s Creek.
11. Section No. 9 k, Gellingall.
This example has a reddish felsitic base. The color it seems is due to red
granules, which more or less permeate and even make up the mass.
Those felspar crystals (orthoclase), which are still distinguishable in the ground
mass, are also filled by a grey granular material. The difference between the two
classes of granular material is apparently only in the color. Where the grey
material is very abundant, the felspar crystals are quite opaque. It suggests itself
that this is due to the production of kaolin through decomposition of the felspar,
in the one case being with and in the other without ferric hydrate.


Some opaque black substance is widely scattered, which, may be magnetite.
On examining the felspar prisms by polarized light they prove to be partly made
up of the grey cloudy substance and partly of minute quartz granules. These latter,
in the view that the cloudy appearance of the felspars is due to the production of
kaolin, might represent the excluded silica.
A few clear quartz crystals complete the list of constituents. This may be
classed as a porphyritic felsite,
12. Section No. 10 a, Gellingall.
This rock has a grey or elsewhere yellowish felsitic ground mass. It varies in
color, and shows fluid structure in waving bands of irregular width.
In the ground mass are—
(l.) Felspar prisms, more or less perfectly formed. One large prism has
been broken across, and the base has passed through the fracture,
carrying with it some minute felspar crystals.
(2.) Crystalline grains and crystals of quartz. These are in places
fractured.
(3.) Rarely, small distinctly striated plagioclase felspars.
(4.) Magnetite in crystals and grains.
(5.) A dark-green translucent mineral.
This latter is in rhombic, or octahedral (modified rhombic) forms. It is always
more or less associated with magnetite, and polarizes as an aggregate of scales, thus
resembling chlorite. I am unable to define it, except perhaps as being an altered
hornblende, to which mineral the rhombic forms have resemblance.— Litho-
graph Plate No. 2, Fig. 9.)
13. Buchan River, near Gellingall.
This rock sample was selected from the intensely hard, dark-colored, and massive
quartz felsites of the Buchan River near Gellingall. They are the extension of
those mountain-forming masses from which the last example was derived. In situ
they could only be described as quartz felsites, and yet I observed more than one
place where included fragments were by no means rare.
This rock has a brown felsitic ground mass, in which the fluid structure is not
very apparent. Between crossed nicols it reacts in a remarkable manner. It
becomes dark, and remains so, with the exception of faint traces of light in places
during a complete rotation. This points to a vitreous condition, such as that of
pitchstone. I have nowhere else observed this in this class of rocks of Gippsland.
In the ground mass are—
(l.) Very numerous more or less imperfect prisms of orthoclase, which
include a green flaky mineral, some magnetite, and a few stout colorless
microlites.
(2.) A few small prisms of plagioclase.
(3.) Small grains and a few large crystals of quartz. These latter contain
portions of devitrified base and many minute fluid cavities.
(4.) Magnetite in crystals and grains in small quantity.
(5.) The dark-green translucent mineral described in 12.


14. Dyke.—Section No. 9 h, Gellingall.
This dykestone has a felsitic ground mass of a pale-brown color. In this are—
(l.) Number of very minute plagioclase prisms.
(2.) Very numerous grains and crystals of magnetite.
(3.) Minute colorless acicular microlites.
In this ground mass are—
(l.) Porphyritic crystals of felspar.
They polarize with color, and have a faintly striated appearance, but not the
polysynthetic structure of the ordinary triclinio felspars. They resemble instances
which I have observed in gabbro, diabase, and even basalt.
Their structure is such as might be produced by numbers of very narrow
lamin®, composed each of shorter lengths placed endways to each other, and each
chain of parts optically discordant with its neighbour. The appearance is such as
I have observed in cases of intergrowth of plagioclase with orthoclase. I have no
doubt, however, that these felspars are triclinic.
(2.) Pale-yellow grains, or more or less perfect crystals, whose angles, where I
could measure them, were those of augite. Some of these have been altered
into viridite. An example is figured (Lithograph Plate No. 2, Fig. 2).
This dyke is, therefore, composed of plagioclase, augite, and magnetite (with
some chlorite), porphyritically embedded in a felsitic base. Were there no augite,
this would be classed as a porphyrite ; were there hornblende, in lieu of augite, it
would be a hornblende porphyrite ; were the felsitic base absent, it would be a
diabase. The rock is anomalous ; but it may perhaps be described as a porphy-
ritio diabase or an augite porphyrite.
15. Basalt.—Section No. 12 g, Bach Creek.
The ground mass is composed of a network of minute plagioclase prisms. The
interspaces are filled in by calcite and viridite, with a considerable amount of
magnetite and ferric hydrate.
In this are large plagioclase prisms, which are, however, much altered, the
interior being more or less replaced by calcite or viridite. The general alteration
to which this rock has been subjected is shown by the large numbers of irregularly-
shaped spaces filled in by (1) calcite, (2) viridite, or by both.—( See Lithograph
Plate No. 2, Fig. 6.)
It may be observed that the small plagioclase prisms in the ground mass are
arranged round these cavities in the same way as they may be also seen to be
arranged round crystals, for instance in the basalts. This clearly points to fluid
structure, and to these spaces as representing the sites of crystals of felspar, augite,
or olivine ; which not only have been removed, but have implicated portions of the
surrounding mass in their decomposition.
16. Intrusive Basalt, near the junction of the Murendel and Buchan Rivers.
The rock has a micro-porphyritio structure. The ground mass is semi-crystalline,
and consists of —
(1.) A large amount of devitrified base.
(2.) Numbers of small plagioclase prisms, which form an open network.
(3.) Grains and crystals of magnetite, and, perhaps, titanic iron, which are so
numerous as to render the slice somewhat opaque in places.


In this ground mass are—
(l.) Larger prisms of the usual character of the plagioclase of basalts.
(2.) Somewhat broader prisms, which have rectangular outlines and are not
striated. These have, almost without exception, a considerable amount
of devitrified base included centrally, leaving a clear margin. These are,
no doubt, orthoclase, and precisely resemble, in every particular, similar
occurrences in the porphyritic basalt of the Dargo High Plains.
(3.) Grains of light brownish-yellow augite. This only includes minute
portions of base, and, in some places, a secondary product, hematite, in
translucent red scales.
This may be regarded as representing the unaltered condition of the rocks ; the
altered form being that just described (15). Surrounding a group of these augite
grains the amorphous base preponderates, and the smaller plagioclase prisms of the
ground mass are arranged in conformity with the outlines of the augite group.
The stream, so to say, of felspars, divides on nearing it, passes round on each side,
and reunites beyond. These are just those features which are evident in the calcite
and viridite concretions of the altered rook. The decomposites of augite may be
supposed, under certain conditions, to result in the products of viridite and calcite.
In the altered rock the devitrified base seems to have been very generally replaced
by viridite.
17. Intrusive Basalt, Murendel Mine.—Section 13 a.
This basalt has a micro-porphyritic structure. The ground mass is semi-crystal-
line, being composed of—
(1.) A large amount of devitrified base.
(2.) Numerous small plagioclase prisms, which form an open network. Many
of the prisms are arranged with their longer diameters approximately
parallel; and in this direction the prisms form streams, which pass round
the larger constituent minerals in well-marked examples of fluid structure.
(3.) Pale brownish-yellow augite grains.
(4.) Very numerous grains and crystals of magnetite. —(See Lithograph Plate
No. 2, Fig. 4.)
The small interspaces are often filled in by viridite; very minute circular colorless
microlites penetrate the devitrified base.
In this ground mass are—
(l.) Large plagioclase prisms.
(2.) A few shorter, broader felspars, with rectangular outlines, and not striated
—orthoclase.
(3.) Brownish-yellow augite, in grains, and occasionally in well-formed crystals.
One of these shows the planes I, ii, ii, and has an internal nucleus with the
prismatic planes only. Below this and the bounding planes are well-
marked lines of growth. The augite only includes a little magnetite.
(4.) Irregular spaces filled by calcite, viridite, and chalcedony. The latter in
concentric mammillary masses implanted on the inner surface of the cavity.
The viridite is of two kinds, which are distinguished in ordinary light by
their color, and by their reactions with polarized light. One variety con-
sists of an aggregation of green scales, and is almost certainly chlorite.


In this slice changes may be viewed which connect the unaltered augite grains
and crystals with those concretions which I have suggested represent the former
position of augite, and perhaps olivine.
This rock is unmistakably a basalt. It greatly resembles a sample which I have
prepared from the porphyritic basalt of the Dargo High Plains.
No conclusion can be drawn from an examination of thin slices as to its geologi-
cal age. I have as yet found no characters which can be said to be peculiar to the
Newer or Older Tertiary basalts, or to the still older Palaeozoic basalt of the
Snowy Bluff.
18. Altered Basalt, Murendel South.
This example was collected where the basalt has penetrated among the lime-
stones.
It has a grey somewhat indistinct ground mass, in which are—
(l.) Somewhat dim outlines of minute plagioclase prisms.
(2.) Dark-brown or black specks or squares, representing probably magnetite
and its alteration to ferric hydrate.
(3.) Interspaces filled by light-green viridite.
In this ground mass are—
(l.) Rarely, large plagioclase prisms, which are much altered.
(2.) Hexagonal or irregularly shaped dark-brown spaces, most of which have
centrally clear portions which polarize as aggregates. The most regularly
formed of these occurrences have the angles of olivine. —{See Lithograph
Plate No. 2, Fig. 5.)
Those which have dark-brown margins have also an internal dark network,
connected with the exterior, which is highly suggestive of olivine. Some
portions are translucent, and are then of a deep-red color, and with polarized light
react like mica. Examined in the rook by the naked eye or by a lens, this mineral
is seen to be highly cleavable, even approaching micaceous, to be soft—about H. 3
or less—and to have a brownish-red or bright-red streak. Its mode of occurrence
in this altered basalt and its crystalline form connect it with olivine. Its structure
and the translucent red crystallized portions connect it with rubellane.
Mr. G-. H. F. Ulrich has described a micaceous mineral found in basalt at
Vaughan and Footscray. He attributes it to the alteration of olivine, and refers it
to rubellane.* He informs me that in the mineral which he described the mica-
ceous structure is more perfect than in that from Murendel, of which I forwarded
him an example.
Mr. Allport describes olivine altered to hematite at Burling in Dumbarton.j -
I observe that rubellane is described by J. D. Dana as being considered an
altered biotite, and as occurring in hexagonal forms of a red color in a kind of
wacke.| Des Cloizeaux also states that the rubellane of Breithaupt is found
in a wacke at Schima in Bohemia, at Zwickau in a porphyry and an amygdaloid.§
The terms “wacke” and “amygdaloid” maybe regarded as synonymous with
altered basalt, and the porphyry may or may not be basic.

It seems, I think, questionable whether these recorded occurrences of rubellane
might not all be referred to the alteration of olivine rather than biotite
19. Limestone from Western Fault, Murendel River.
This rock, examined as a thin slice, showed no peculiarity worthy of notice
except that its structure was minutely granular.
20. Limestone.
This sample was taken from a very hard band, near where the western fault
crosses the Murendel River. A shaft of the Potosi Company had been sunk
following the dip of this band in search of ore. It is extremely hard, crystalline,
and of a pale slaty-grey color.
Under the microscope it proves to he crystalline granular. The granules are
either more or less rhombic or irregular in shape. Some have distinct cleavage,
while others show no trace of it.
A qualitative examination showed it to be a dolomitic limestone, with a little
carbonate of iron. A comparative examination of a fragment of similar size of
dolomite from Predazzo indicated that the former rock probably contains in the
carbonates of magnesia and iron an amount about equivalent to the magnesian
carbonate of the true dolomite.

R EMARKS ON ROCK SAMPLES COLLECTED BY MR. REGINAD A. F. MURRAY
FROM THE AVON RIVER, MOUNT WELLINGTON, ETC.
1. Mount Hump Creek, Avon River.
Examined under the microscope as a thin slice, this rock proves to be Diabase
consisting of—
(1.) Triclinic felspar.
(2.) Pale-brown augite in grains.
(3.) Magnetite.
(4.) Chlorite.
2. Mount Hump Creek, Avon River.
A slice of this rock examined under the microscope proves to have lost all
distinctive characters which could be relied upon to indicate its original structure.


PLATE. 2.


It much, resembles a highly altered hard serpentinous rock from Tasmania, a
sample of which is in my possession.
It is composed almost wholly of concretions colored throughout by some chloritic
mineral.*
I regard it as probably representing one of the most completely metamorphosed
forms of melaphyr.
3. Avon River.
This is stated to be a fragment from a boulder.
The ground mass of this rock consists of a network of minute plagioclase prisms.
Much viridite is distributed through the base. In the ground mass are very
numerous grains and imperfect crystals of augite. Magnetite is also present with
occasional flakes of hematite. The structure narrowly resembles that of an
example of hasaltite from Zwickan in my possession. It would therefore be
classed, if of Pre-Tertiary age, among the melaphyrs.
4. Branch of Mount Hump Creek, a Tributary of the Avon River.
This is a variety of granite which, in its structure, stands somewhat nearer to the
quartz felsites than to the true granites. It is a crystalline granular compound of—
(1.) Orthoclase felspar.
(2.) Quartz in crystalline grains.
(3.) A very little plagioclase in small striated prisms ; and
(4.) A little biotite mica.
The two latter are quite subordinate to the former.
5. From Section crossing from Mount Hump Creek towards Mount Wellington,
The greater part of the mass consists of irregularly spheroidal or quite irregular
concretions. The outer part of these concretions is full of a grey cloudy and
granular substance resembling that so often to be observed in altered felspars.
Following this and extending centrally are grey or almost colorless prisms, having
somewhat the crystalline appearance of epidote. The centre is filled up by colorless
quartz.
The space between the concretions is rendered obscure by the same grey cloudy
material already mentioned, but in it here and there are outlines narrowly resembling
in shape and position those of the ordinary plagioclase prisms of basalt or melaphyr.
I believe this to be an extreme form of melaphyr,
5. Ben Cruachan Creek,
A crystalline ground mass of plagioclase prisms in which the twin structure is
well displayed. In this are —
(1.) Porphyritic plagioclase prisms.
(2.) The remains of augite granules.
(3.) Magnetite, and other opaque black material.
There are numerous irregular concretions occurring, filled mainly by quartz, in
which are crystals of epidote implanted marginally. Viridite is generally distributed
through this rock.
♦ Where it is necessary in these notes to mention these undefined chloritic or delesslte-like substances, which are of so
frequent occurrence in the older basic rocks, I shall avail myself of the term “ Viridite,” as proposed by Professor Strong.
—Neues Jahrbuch/w' Mineralogy 1877, p. 45.
u


From its rather coarse structure, it might be termed a fine-grained diabase, and
would then bear the same relation to melaphyr that some dolerites bear to basalt.
6. From Section from Mount Sump Creek towards Mount Wellington.
The structure is minutely granular rather than micro-crystalline. A few
porphyritic plagioclase prisms are to he recognised in the general mass. In this
rock, as in sample 5, concretions take up much space. The general green color of
the rock is due to the universal occurrence of viridite.
7. From Section from Mount Hump Creek towards Mount Wellington.
The character of this rook is almost wholly obliterated by internal changes which
have taken place in it. The concretionary structure is strongly developed, as in
other samples.
Flocks of dark-green chlorite are plentifully distributed in the quartz which fills
in part of the concretions. This is again, I think, an extreme form of melaphyr.
8. Mount Hump Creek.
This rock resembles sample 5, but is more cloudy and opaque. The concretions
are not so close together, and the outlines of the plagioclase prisms in the inter-
spaces between them are more numerous and more distinct in character.
The concretions seemingly consist entirely of—
(1.) Epidote.
(2.) A little quartz.
I regard this as a form of highly-altered melaphyr,
9. Mount Hump Creek, towards Mount Wellington.
The remarks made as to 5 apply equally to this example.
10. Mount Hump Creek.
This rock is made up almost entirely of minute plagioclase prisms, with some
magnetite, a little viridite throughout, but the ground mass is mainly filled in by
the grey cloudy substance so commonly observable in altered felspars. In the
ground mass are—
(l.) A few irregularly-shaped porphyritic triclinic felspars.
(2.) A solitary crystalline grain of clear quartz, which has exactly the habit of
the crystalline grains of quartz felsites. It includes a portion of the base,
and the minute triclinic felspars surrounding it conform in their direction
to its outlines. It would seem therefore to be an original constituent,
and not a secondary alteration product.
The occurrence of a quartz granule in so basic a rock as is this
melaphyr must be regarded as a most exceptional occurrence.
11. Summit of Mount Wellington,
A fine-grained quartz felsite.
12. Ben Cruackan Creek.
This rock has a micro-crystalline ground mass of small triclinic felspars. The
interspaces are filled in by viridite, and here and there by epidote. There are a


few larger porphyritic prisms, and magnetite is irregularly scattered through the
mass. The concretions which occur are—
(l.) Marginally of epidote.
(2.) Following this, quartz.
(3.) Centrally, a mass of chlorite.
The basaltic structure can be well recognised, but this rock, being of Pre-Tertiary
age, would be classed as melaphyr.
13. Ben Cruachan Creek.
A ground mass of small plagioclase prisms filled in by viridite. In this are—
(l.) Porphyritic larger triclinic felspars.
(2.) Magnetite.
(3.) Numerous cavities and interspaces filled by epidote.
This also belongs to the melaphyrs, and the basaltic structure is still recognisable.
14. Ben Cruachan Creek.
This rock exactly resembles the last in structure and composition, but in it a few
grains of augite are still recognisable.
15. Ben Cruachan Creek.
The structure is micro-crystalline, and composed mainly of small plagioclase
prisms. Among them are a few larger ones, and the interspaces are filled in by
viridite. One or two concretions occur, but of not well-defined character. There
are a few minute grains of augite and some magnetite. The basaltic character is
recognisable.
16. Ben Cruachan Creek.
The ground mass of this rock is peculiar in being filled in by small lighter-colored
spots, which in places nearly touch each other, and then take a linear direction.
Through the mass wavy lighter-colored bands pass. Crystalline grains of quartz
are numerous. This is a quartz felsite, and somewhat nearly resembles occurrences
at the Snowy Bluff.
The samples which in the preceding remarks I have defined as melaphyrs form
a series of more or less altered rocks, at one end of which the basaltic character of
the rock and of its constituent minerals is well marked, while at the other end this
character is completely obliterated by alteration. Intermediately are instances
which combine both structures, and thus connect the whole series.
After having made a careful examination and comparison of them with a series
of examples from the Snowy Bluff, I regard these malaphyrs as representing the
same group of basic igneous rocks met with at that place, but they have in these
examples lost far more completely their original structure. To such an extent has
the metamorphism of many of these rocks extended, that, taken separately, it
would be most difficult to conjecture their former condition. Regarding, however,
the stratigraphical conditions of their occurrence, as indicated to me by Mr. Murray,*
their connection with the group of more basaltic melaphyrs of the Snowy Bluff
becomes more apparent.
On grounds which I have previously stated at length, I regard the alterations
observable here as due to metamorphism.

REPORT ON THE SOUTH EXTENDED SULTAN COMPANY’S
MINE, BLACKWOOD.
The ground occupied by the South Extended Sultan Company is traversed by
several quartz veins, and also contains a deposit of auriferous drift, both of which
have been and are now being worked upon. The attached geological plan and
section show the occurrence of these veins and drifts, as well as the sites of the
several shafts, adits, &c., on and adjoining the company’s leasehold. The large
drawing accompanying this paper represents a plan or horizontal section of the
main or lower adit, with all the workings carried on to date. The notes inserted
on this drawing describe the character of the “ country ” exposed by the mining
operations.
Quartz Lodes.
The quartz lodes, or indications of lodes, which have been touched upon in the
shafts and adits, or are cropping out on the surface, are nine (9) in number. Their
trend, in common with the normal strike of the Silurian rocks, is from 10° to 17°
east of north. Commencing at the western boundary of the leasehold, on the left
bank of the Lerderderg, and proceeding in an easterly direction, these veins are as
follow: —
No. 1 Vein. —A thin band of quartz, half an inch thick, cut through by the adit
20 feet from the entrance. It is worthless.
No. 2 Vein. —At a distance of 177 feet from the mouth of the adit the country
is faulted by a slide dipping south-westerly under an angle of 28°. Above this
slide there is a reef-like body of indurated sandstone (quartzite) 3 feet 4 inches
thick, streaked with numerous bands of quartz; below the slide occur three veins,
as shown on Figure 1. The central vein has a persistent course which has been
followed northward for 264 feet in No. 2 level. The greatest thickness observed
is 4 inches; it splits up in places into several ramifications; in others it is com-
pletely pinched out. The vein has been well prospected and proved barren. It will
answer no useful purpose to continue further operations on this vein.
FIG. 1.
Section at No. 2 Level on southern
wall of Adit.
FIG. 2.
Section of No. 3 Vein on northern
wall of Adit.
iVo. 3 Vein lies 16 feet east of the last-mentioned vein. It is an irregular body
of quartz, from 2 to 5 inches thick, and is faulted in the manner shown on Figure 2.
The walls are ill-defined, and the veinstone appears to be of limited extent. It is




with these features in view, no doubt, that the vein has not been considered worth
prospecting. I concur in the mining manager’s opinion that it would be useless
to open out upon this vein.
No. 4 Vein. —At a distance of 21 feet east of No. 3 vein the northern wall of
the adit exhibits a group of thin veins and hands of quartz, resting upon the bedding
and joint planes of the slate rock, as indicated on Figure 3. They are evidently
local segregations, and, judging by the fact that on the southern wall there is
only the faintest trace of the vertical vein visible, their extent is likely to be
insignificant. The veinstone is barren and valueless.
No. 5 Vein. —This vein, half an inch thick at the adit, dies out at a distance of
10 feet northward. A level was driven for 33 feet, and a winze started in very
dense slate. As might have been foreseen this work has turned out as fruitless as
it was expensive.
FIG. 3.
Section of No. 4 Vein and Ramifications
on northern wall of Adit.
FIG. 4.
Section of No. 6 Vein on southern
wall of Adit.
No. 6 Vein. —The dip* of the veins so far described is easterly from 60° to 70°.
At a distance of 410 feet east of the mouth of the main adit an opposite inclination
(to the west) is observed in a vein from 2 to 6 inches thick, while the constant dip
of the schist rock persists in its easterly direction (vide Fig. 4). A level has been
driven 20 feet north, at the face of which the walls of the vein widen out to from
18 to 20 inches, and enclose an agglomeration of grey
sandy clay, and fragments of the bordering rock, with
thin streaks and plates of quartz. Irregular veins
also join the main body on both sides under various
angles (vide Fig. 5). Apart from the character of
the lode stone, which has so far proved absolutely
barren, the features disclosed by the present workings
sufficiently attest to the improbability of the vein
opening out to workable size on the adit level, and it
would, therefore, he injudicious to continue search
operations by the extension of any drives on this
level.
In the upper adit, at a distance of 550 feet north

dip, strike, and surroundings to, and evidently a continuation of, No. 6 vein. It has
there been pursued for a distance of upwards of 200 feet along its strike, but the
thickness nowhere exceeded 5 inches, and no gold appears to have been noticed.
From the mouth of the upper adit this vein has been traced on the surface in
a series of shallow pits for a space of 1,600 feet to and beyond No. 2 shaft. It
crops out 70 feet east of this shaft, in a body of quartz 5 feet 3 inches thick,
dipping west 65°. Gold was found on the east side of this lode. The shaft is
sunk to a depth of 100 feet 7 inches, and a cross-cut driven easterly towards the
lode, 38 feet long. At this distance a quartz band inches thick, and dipping
east 70° to 75°, was struck. This is, no doubt, a distinct vein. If the westerly dip
observed on the surface were persistent, then the lode should have been encountered
in the 100 feet level at a distance of 22 feet from the shaft. It is, however, not
unlikely that the No. 6 vein at a greater depth will assume the constant easterly
dip of the surrounding country, and its probable position may be looked for con-
siderably further east.
I would recommend that the cross-cut be extended eastward for a distance of say
30 feet, or until the lode is intercepted. If the character of the stone then exposed
warrant the undertaking, stoping may be carried on simultaneously at this level and
from the surface downwards. The shaft and ladders are in good working order.
No. 7 Vein. —At a distance of 116 feet east of No. 6 vein the lower adit cuts
across two veins, 17 inches apart, of black carbonaceous clay with occasional streaks
of quartz, encased by well-defined bedding planes of grey sandy slate. These clay
veins have been followed in a northerly drive, 18 feet long, under the supposition
that they formed the “ track ” of a reef. They are simply veins of attrition, and
the expenditure incurred in opening out upon them is altogether useless.
No. 8 Vein. —Forty-six feet further east occurs a vein 2J inches thick, precisely
similar to the No. 7 vein. It has, like the former, been the mistaken cause of
opening a drive along its course, 15 feet to the south. This work also serves no
profitable end.
No, 9, or Laurie's Vein. —This vein lies from 1,500 to 1,600 feet east of No. 6
vein, occasional outcrops being noticeable for a distance of 28 chains between the
Lerderderg and No. 3 shaft on the crown of the range. The vein dips westerly from
65° to 85°. In No. 3 shaft (vide Fig. 6) two lodes, from sto 8 feet asunder, have
been wrought with partial success. At the 45 feet level the western lode is 12 to
15 inches thick, and has been taken out for a length of 20 feet. It there merges
in places into the quartzite elsewhere noticed in this locality, and the labor of
separating the productive veinstone from the barren rock becomes necessarily costly.
The quartz is said to have yielded 7 dwt. per ton. At 65 feet from the surface this
lode dies out. The eastern or main lode is from 24 to 12 inches thick, and was
wrought for 20 feet north of the shaft, the stone yielding 3 dwt. per ton. At that
distance the lode is thrown, as shown in Figure 7, by a fault which was followed
westerly for 10 feet, when the faulted portion of the lode was struck, and worked
for nearly 100 feet, connecting with the surface workings, which extend to 120
feet north of the shaft. These workings expose three or four irregular veins
dipping under a high angle; the stone gave generally good returns (as high as 15
dwt. per ton) on the upper levels, but became profitless at lower depths. The
quartz on the north side of the fault is stated to have been more productive than
that taken from the southern portion of the lode. At 230 feet south of No. 3


shaft the cap of the vein suddenly
increases to the thickness of from
2 feet to 4 feet 6 inches. In mak-
ing a shallow excavation to lay
bare the walls of the vein, gold,
I am informed, was freely seen.
I would recommend that No. 3
shaft be sunk to the depth of 100
feet, a cross-cut put in west till
the lode is struck—which will be
at about 15 feet; then to drive
southerly along the course of the
lode until meeting the surface. If
the lode prove of workable size and
productiveness the best mode of
working it is by stopes and winzes,
the stopes in every case to run
south till meeting the sloping sur-
face of the hill, while the tram is
to be laid in the stopes and shifted
to the different levels as required.
The necessity for driving a tun-
nel will not in that case arise.
Alluvial Deposits.
The “ older drift,” as shown on
the annexed geological plan, occu-
pies an area of about 8 acres. It
is clearly a remnant of the river
drift accumulated during Middle
Pliocene times in an embouchure
which was formed by a tributary
stream flowing southward into a
main water-course, probably cor-
responding to the modern valley of
the Lerderderg. Numerous shafts
and tunnels have entered the deposit at various times during
the last eighteen years ; but, owing partly to the primitive mode
of working adopted, and partly to the “ patchy ” nature of the
washdirt, mining operations have been abandoned in most
cases at an early stage. From the information I was able to
collect it appears that the workings were at no time very pro-
ductive. The “ color ” was obtained nearly throughout, but
on the whole the ground would not have been payable had it
not been for the unearthing of some exceptionally heavy
pieces of gold. Nuggets weighing 18 to 20 oz. are reported
to have been occasionally met with. The northern and

greater part of the deposit has, however, hardly been touched except by the work-
ings from the company’s lower adit, and even these, it must be admitted, have
been carried on in a somewhat desultory manner. They should, in my opinion,
be conducted in the first instance more with a view of exploring the extent and
character of the auriferous deposit than one of establishing the most direct com-
munication on the easiest gradient.
The lithological character of the drift has been described in the remarks inserted
on the mine plan. It remains only to be noted that the coarse gold here, as else-
where, is likely to rest along shelves and terraces of the bed-rock, and it is well,
therefore, to examine at the outset the upper or northern margin of the embouchure.
For this purpose the drives already put in by the company are of little value. The
southern drive, apart from the inconvenience of starting at the roof of the adit, is
too close to the steep bank of the lead channel; the north-western drive has too
much lateral bearing for a level, yet is entailing too much dead work for a cross-cut.
I would suggest to return to a point 36 feet west of No. 1 shaft, where the bed-
rock sinks to the floor of the adit, and drive a tunnel south 12° east 300 feet more
or less to the surface. In the same way continue the northern drive, near No. 1
shaft, in a direction north 10° east 250 feet or thereabout to the limit of the drift
deposit. In both cases cross-cuts should be driven at regular intervals of say 50
feet to the western margin of the lead, making careful trial washings in every
instance. If the result of these explorations justify the blocking-out of the lead, then
let the main adit be abandoned as a means of traffic, and work bo conducted from
a new tunnel which should start from the left bank of the Lerderderg, south-east
of No. 1 shaft, but the exact position of which can be fixed only after the deepest
level of the lead has been ascertained. The driving of the main adit should be
discontinued for the present.
Summary Remarks.
1. I cannot recommend any further expenditure for the exploration of the quartz
veins in the lower or main adit.
2. No. 6 vein is worth prospecting from No. 2 shaft. The cross-cut in that shaft
should be extended eastward in the way described in the concluding paragraph
under the heading “No. 6 vein.”
3. No. 9 vein presents features favoring further exploration. No. 3 shaft to be
sunk to a depth of 100 feet; a cross-cut put in west 15 feet more or less to reef,
and a level driven along lode (vide Fig. 6).
4. The “ alluvial,” offering prospects of more immediate returns of profit, should
be at once systematically examined by means of two levels and cross-cuts as above
described, and indicated in red lines and notes on the mine plan.
Concluding Remark.
Mr. Elliot, the company’s intelligent mining manager, has afforded me every
assistance during the survey and examination of the mine and environs.

the North Waranga Mining Subdivision.”
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,

Secretary for Mines, &c., Melbourne,
REMARKS ON THE GEOLOGY AND MINING RESOURCES OF THE
NORTH WARANGA MINING SUBDIVISION.
The interesting area of country comprised within this subdivision is but little
known to the public. It has received scant attention from the press or official
reports, the published maps show approximately only the positions of a few moun-
tains, creeks, and towns, the remainder is a blank, and it may therefore well be
termed a terra incognita. In the following remarks it is my intention to supply
some topographical as well as geological and mining information respecting this
country.
Granite.
The only outcrop of granite in the district lies in the south-eastern corner
between Sandy Creek and the Goulburn River. (This outcrop of granite is not
marked on the geological sketch-maps of Victoria.) As will be seen in the
accompanying sketch-map, that portion of it which is exposed occupies but a
limited area of the surface. To the north of the creek, at the foot of Mount
Black, the granite (ternary) is rather coarse-grained, of a brown-pinkish color, and
is fast decomposing; but to the south it is finer-grained, of a light-grey color, and
evidently durable and well fitted for building purposes. Some of it has been
quarried —if I may use the expression—from a huge boulder which lies near the
foot of the mount on its northern flank, and used for the foundation stone of the
Waranga Shire Hall at Rush worth.
FIG. 1.—Granite Boulder.
Figure 1 represents another large boulder, which lies to the west of the one
just mentioned, and distant from it some few hundred yards.

The granite is evidently exposed through the effects of denudation. It occupies
the whole of the bottom of the valley, which is surrounded by precipitous
hills composed of apparently indurated Upper Silurian rocks. Granite forms the
base and lower half of Mount Black, whilst the upper half consists of Upper
Silurian rocks. The Sugarloaf Hill to the north of the mount, on the opposite side
of the valley, was, I found, of a like construction ; and the hills to the west were
based on granite which did not, however, ascend so high up their sides, owing to
the rocks having been subjected to less denudation. The sketch-section Fig. 2,
FIG. 2.—Sketch-section showing the junction of Granite and Slate Rocks.
illustrates tlie exposure of granite rock in this valley. From what I observed of
the relative position of the rocks existing here I should say that the deeper valleys
for some distance round this place were separated by but thin deposits of detritus
and Silurian rocks from the underlying granitic formation. On the south-west side
of the Sugarloaf Hill the strike of the slate rock is north and south, with a slight
dip to the east. These observations were made on a strong outcrop only a few
yards above where the granite was visible in the side of the hill.
To the north-east of Mount Black, and on the opposite side of the creek at its
foot, a granite (binary) vein or dyke exists, which consists of a pink orthoclase base
having a little light-colored mica in very fine scales distributed throughout it, and
occasionally quartz grains.
Upper Silurian.
The whole of the country lying between the high range bounding the Spring
Creek Yalley on the north and to the Murray tertiaries, and between the Mount
Camel Trap Range and the Goulburn Yalley, apparently consists of Upper Silurian
rooks. The auriferous portion is hilly and very thickly wooded.
Perhaps the most singular feature connected with the geology of this district —
as compared with the larger portion of Yictoria—is the want of uniformity in the
strike of the Silurian strata. For example, in the immediate vicinity of Rushworth
it is east, about a mile to the west it is north-east, and about two miles and a half
distant it is north-west. Between Rushworth and Whroo it is east and west. In
the neighborhood of Whroo the latter strike prevails, and continues as far south as
a sandstone range about four miles distant from the last-named place. At Fontain-
bleau, about five miles west of this range, the strike is north-west; and at about a
mile to the south of this place it is again found to be east and west. The strike at
Coy’s Diggings and Cherry-tree Flat, to the south of the sandstone range before-
mentioned, is north-west, and prevails at least as far as two miles west of the last-
named place. It is nearly north and south at Mount Black and at the ranges about


ten miles to the west of Coy’s Diggings. From the foregoing statements it is
evident that the strata for about ten miles in length between Rushworth and the
sandstone range have undergone considerable disturbance, insomuch that the rooks
strike at nearly right angles to the prevailing direction of the strata to the south
and west. Further evidence of the disturbance of the rocks will be found under
the head of “ Quartz Reefs.” I may also remark that the strata generally are tilted
very nearly to the perpendicular.
Near the granite at Mount Black the rocks become metamorphosed—darker in
color than that prevailing in the district (which is yellowish-white and cream color)
—are harder, and the cleavage more perfect.
The sandstone adjoining the Fossil Reef at Rushworth contains numerous casts
of encrinite stems and other fossils.
In the latter part of the year 1867 I found some fossils in a sandstone range a
few miles to the south of Whroo, which have been examined by Professor McCoy,
who stated in his report that the fossil casts were almost indeterminable. * * *
“ There are two articular surfaces of crinoid stems of the aotinoorinus type, one
small coral, probably Favosites fibrosa , one indeterminable Lamellibranch, and two
fragments of the Upper Silurian variety of the Orthis calligramma. The balance
of the evidence is therefore in favor of the rock being Upper Silurian.”
A small range in which a bed of fossiliferous pudding-stone conglomerate
outcrops is situated near the head of one of the eastern branches of the
Cornelia Creek. It is surrounded by higher and more conspicuous ranges. In
fact the whole of the country here for many miles in all directions consists of
precipitous Upper Silurian hills, thickly covered by a forest of box and ironbark
trees, with here and there patches of the tree-grass. (Not being successful in at
first finding the site of the fossils in the conglomerate, much of the neighboring
country was examined.) The quartz pebbles from the conglomerate bed, which bed
occupied the crown of the range, were strewn over its sides down to the edges of
the gullies. In several places parallel beds of lesser width outcropped, and large
blocks of cemented gravel lay partly hidden in the scrub. The water-worn gravel
and pebbles ranged in size from coarse sand to large pebbles as much as three
inches in diameter. The existence of these pebbles and of corals in the con-
glomerate beds indicate that they were originally deposited in a shallow sea. The
strike of the beds and of the bounding strata was ill-defined; it may, however, be
set down as nearly north and south. Indications of fossils were numerous, but
perfect or nearly perfect casts were rare, and obtained only by considerable labor
and search. Twenty fair specimens were obtained, and these have been submitted
to Professor McCoy.
Alluviums.
The Waranga goldfields were first opened in the latter part of the year 1853.
They may therefore be reckoned amongst the oldest of Victorian goldfields ; and,
by this time, as may well be understood, nearly all the gullies are wrought, and
some, worked over again and again, still yield a livelihood to a considerable number
of miners.
The name “Waranga” was obtained from the native title of the squatter’s run
on which the first gold discoveries were made.


The most northern and most important gold workings are at and in the vicinity
of Eushworth, where, at the close of the September quarter of this year, 513 alluvial
miners were employed in mining. The principal alluvial workings are, or have been,
on the Old Lead. The head of the lead is in Growler’s Gully, at the back and to the
west of the township. This lead trends easterly, and probably terminates in the
Waranga Swftmp. Many rich tributaries flow into it, but those joining it on the
southern side are the most considerable. This lead has yielded more gold than any
other in the district; it is but shallow, as the deepest shafts sunk on it are only
from 35 feet to 55 feet in depth.
Since the date of my recent visit (23rd August 1877) Mr. S. Bryant Eowe, the
local mining surveyor, has reported on a small “rush,” to a place situated about two
miles and a half to the east of Eushworth, on the road to Waranga. lie describes
the ground in work as being distant about a quarter of a mile from the old shafts
on the Old Lead, of which it is considered a branch. The depth of the sinking is
from 25 to 35 feet, and it was hoped that the gold would continue down into the
Old Lead. At the time of reporting only two claims besides the prospector’s had
yielded gold.* The sinking was through soft sandy loam, and was quite dry.
The character of the cement and washdirt in the lead is very like to the Deep
Load at Bendigo, and both leads are probably of the same age (Older Pliocene,
oldest gold drift).
Other minor auriferous streams flow into the Waranga Swamp, but they have as
yet received little attention.
Whether Waranga Swamp, the receptacle of these golden creeks, will ever pay
to work, is a matter that can only be decided by the miner. It is, however, not
unreasonable to conjecture that the basin occupied by it is auriferous.
To the west of Eushworth is situated the Castle Lonely Lead ; the sinking here
ranged from 20 to 30 feet in depth, and the washdirt was from I foot to 2 feet 6
inches in thickness. This lead appears to be connected with Chinaman’s Flat and
Old Ned’s Gully, and it has been inferred that if the lead were followed further
towards the north the wide spread washdrift would be found to become concentrated
and form into a more regular lead.
Nuggety Gully, the main feeder or tributary to the Old Lead, crosses the Nug-
gety Eeef in its northerly course. This gully was very rich ; the gold found in it
was of a rather pale color, and little, if at all, water-worn ; the washdirt was of a
very ferruginous character, and contained a large quantity of bean iron ore
(magnetic) ; there was also sub-angular quartz. The very ferruginous character of
the washdirt is not surprising, seeing that the Nuggety Eeef, at the head of the
gully, contained such a largo proportion of iron ore. {See page 160.)
Mr. T. W. Benbow, the late manager of the Bank of Victoria at Eushworth,
who resided on this goldfield for many years, has courteously supplied me with
much valuable information. He says, “ Eushworth alluvial gold ranges in assay
between 21 * 3-g- and 22 •!£, with a loss in melting of 1-t per cent. The average
buying price (with standard at 775.) is 765. 9d. to 775.”
About four miles south of Eushworth are situated the auriferous deposits at
Whroo, in a distinct but adjoining basin. Alluvial mining here has been carried on
* One of these claims had bottomed, so the mining registrar reported, with the excellent result of three-quarters of
an ounce to the tub.


principally in the Main Gully, the Union Lead and its tributaries. These auri-
ferous streams take their rise in the neighborhood of Balaclava Hill, and trend in
a south-easterly direction towards the Reedy Swamp. The overflow waters of this
swamp pour into the Goulburn River. The deepest sinking in the alluviums is on
the Union Lead, and ranges from 35 feet to 55 feet in depth. This lead has been
traced nearly to the swamp, and nearer to it than the operations carried on thus far
upon the Main Gully. The washdrifts of all the gullies on the south-eastern fall
from Whroo are connected with the Union Lead. The cement and washdirt of the
lead are of much the same character as those found in the Old Lead at Rushworth.
The washdirt in the Cemetery Lead, at Whroo, was 18 inches in thickness, and
yielded as much as 1 oz. of gold to the load.
Mr. Benbow states: —“ Whroo alluvial gold is much better than that from
Rushworth. The average assay is 22 •11 and buying price 775. 6d. Loss in
melting 1 1 per cent. The gold from some gullies assays as much as 22 - 3 f.”
Coy’s Diggings lie to the south of Whroo, and are distant from it about six miles.
A non-auriferous low barren range, composed of arenaceous sandstone, separates the
gold workings of these two fields.
The shallow alluvial gullies at Coy’s trend in a north-easterly direction into the
same watershed as the Whroo auriferous drifts ; so far as they have been developed
these deposits are of little importance. The operations have been almost confined
to Coy’s, Burrens’, and Hard-scrabble gullies. In the latter the washdirt was from
10 to 12 inches in thickness. The depth of sinking generally ranged from 4to 12
feet, and the yields during the first twelve months’ mining varied from 4 dwt. to
1 oz. 4 dwt. per load of washdirt.
As Coy’s is essentially a quartz mining field, more details respecting it will be
found under the head of “ Quartz Beefs,” at page 170.
The rocks forming the hills round which the gullies trend are more argillaceous
than those prevailing at Whroo and Rushworth.
The alluvial works at Cherry-tree Flat, which lie about two miles to the south-
east of Coy’s Diggings, are confined to the flat and two small gullies which fall into
it. The alluvial deposits are comparatively unimportant as compared with the
auriferous quartz reefs. A description of the latter is given at page 171.
To the west of Whroo, and about five miles distant, on the Mclvor road, are
situated the Nine-mile Creek diggings. The depth of the alluvium at this place
varies from 6 feet to 25 feet. A section of the sinking at the latter depth is made
up of surface soil, clay, white cement, a very heavy deposit of quartz boulders and
washdirt (from 12 to 20 inches in thickness, which yielded from 4 to 18 dwt. to
the load). The hills here are of the kind named by miners “ made hills,” and
they are probably of the same age as the White Hills of Bendigo (Older Pliocene,
or oldest gold drift).
The main lead has been worked for two miles in length, and tributary gullies
have also been mined. On this lead the shallow sinking was at a lower level as
regards surface elevation than the deep sinking, and the cement and washdirt were
less in thickness, width, and richness than at higher levels, where the auriferous wash
■was found at greater depths. Like circumstances are not uncommon in some of the
important western goldfields of Victoria. In this instance it appears to have
been caused by the new watershed deviating from the old one, crossing it at a low
level, removing and redistributing the overlying detritus and the washdirt.


The thickness of the alluvium at Good Friday Creek, which is situated a few
miles to the south of the Nine-mile, is 40 feet. It consists of surface soil and
gravel, cemented clay and gravel, and a compact argillaceous sand deposit (false
bottom) and washdirt, from 6 to 12 inches in thickness.
At Fontainbleau, which lies midway between the Nine-mile and Good Friday, a
little alluvial mining has been done.
The only large nugget of which I can find any record as having been discovered
in any of these Waranga goldfields was one which weighed 60 oz. It was found
at Siberia in October 1863. The scarcity of nuggets exceeding 5 oz. in weight
is a remarkable feature in connection with the history of these goldfields. The
auriferous alluvium deposits at Siberia are confined to two small patches, each of
about half a mile in length, which are separated by a range through which runs an
east and west quartz reef.
At Friesland (North Spring Creek), which is situated on the eastern branch of
Spring Creek, the sinking was from 20 to 30 feet in depth, the washdirt was about
15 inches in thickness, and the yield of gold was about 5 dwt. to the load.
Shallow alluvial mining has been carried on to a considerable extent in the
numerous gullies which wind between the Buffalo Ranges. These ranges lie to the
east of Whroo and between it and the Goulburn River. The “ old lead ” here at 25
feet in depth proved to be narrow, only about 8 feet in width ; the washdirt was
from 18 inches to 4 feet in thickness. At four miles to the north of this lead
washdirt was found 1 foot in thickness at 6 feet in depth, and it yielded over
12 dwt. to the load. The want of permanent water is the one great difficulty
which retards the development of the undoubtedly payable auriferous deposits at
the Buffalo Ranges.
Near Mount Black a little gold has been obtained by alluvial prospectors.
Cement Mining.
Immense deposits of cement cover considerable areas of the country about Rush-
worth, Whroo, Nine-mile, and Fontainbleau. The cement lies exposed on the surface
in places, and has never been found at other than what may be considered shallow
depths. It has been extensively worked at the undermentioned places, yielding
remunerative quantities of gold and frequently rich patches—Chinaman’s Hill,
Gravel Pits, Old Lead, Nuggety, Cockatoo, Rushworth township, Butcher’s
Gully, &c. Crushings of several hundreds of tons have from time to time been
recorded which have produced from 6 to 10 dwt. of gold to the ton, and there can
be little doubt that as rich cement still remains to be crushed as has been put
through the mills in the past.
General Remarks.
A few prospectors are now engaged in testing the ranges and gullies in the
vicinity of the ranges to the north-east of Redcastle. The extensive tract of
country which lies between Good Friday Creek and Redcastle undoubtedly presents
a good field for the prospectors’ operations, and so does that area from the fossiliferous
Sandstone range to the north of Coy’s, which spreads out in hilly land in a south-
easterly direction to the Goulburn River. It may, in fact, be stated that all the
hilly country to the south of the old Bendigo and Beechworth road not already


occupied by gold workings is worthy of being thoroughly tested. Few such large
areas of promising auriferous country so likely to repay the prospector (with small
capital) now remain untried in Victoria.
The North Waranga division may be truly termed the poor man’s diggings, for
the alluvial sinking is rarely deeper than 40 feet, the greater part of it is less
than 20 feet in depth, and a living can be made almost anywhere in and near the
old workings.
The following remarks made by Mr. Benbow are supplementary to those made
by myself at page 158:—“The largest nugget I know as having been found was at
Old Ned’s Gully, Rushworth, weighing 30 oz. 3 dwt. 18 gr. At Waranga Diggings,
near Gunn’s Swamp, one was found weighing 25 oz. 18 dwt. Storekeeper’s Gully,
Rushworth, yielded one of 21 oz.”
Watersheds.
The singular manner in which the waters from the basins facing towards the
north are absorbed gives an interest to this subject which it would not otherwise
possess.
The heads of the Wanalta and its tributary creeks are separated on the south
from the Major’s and Spring creeks by high Silurian ranges, and on the east from
creeks flowing into the Goulburn River by the high land between Coy’s Diggings
and Whroo. The Wanalta Creek literally flows into the Murray tertiaries, for
before it reaches as far north as the parallel of Lake Cooper it becomes absorbed by
the sandy soil and is lost to view.
From the range to the north of Whroo flow the Waranga Creek, which takes a
north-easterly course to the Waranga Swamp ; and the Moora Creek, which trends
in a north-westerly direction to the Wanalta Creek.
The Waranga Swamp—or lake as it was at one time and may again be fitly
termed after one or two wet seasons —like Lake Tyrrell, Lake Coorong, and
Lalbert Swamp, is situated in the Murray tertiaries, and, like them, it absorbs the
waters poured into it, but fails to show any outlet. Possibly its waters drain off
through the sandy soil into the Goulburn River.
A dividing range separates the eastern from the western watersheds. This
range may be said to commence near the source of the Sandy Creek and to take
a nearly meridional direction northwards to Rushworth.
Auriferous Quartz Reefs.
The peculiarities in the strike and the dip of the reefs in the northern part of the
Waranga division mark them as worthy of the special attention of all persons who
desire to study the circumstances connected with the occurrence of auriferous veins.


QUARTZ MINING AT RUSHWORTH.
The quartz reefs near Rushwortb, with only three exceptions, have an east and
west direction in conformity with the strike of the strata in which they occur.
The reefs, however, underlie to the north very quickly and irregularly, whilst the
strata are nearly vertical. A transverse section would show the dip of the reefs to
be broken like a series of steps.
There are about forty reefs which, by reason of their east and west strike, may
be called cross reefs, as they run at right angles to the prevailing strike of the
auriferous reefs in Victoria. They are characterized by very rich patches of golden
stone. The gold in the reefs which run north and south is evenly distributed, and
the reefs dip both east and west, but do not show evidence of “ saddle” formation.
The veins range in thickness from 6 inches to 6 feet.
There has been but one deep shaft sunk on a quartz reef, and that reached to a
depth of 573 feet. It is situated on the Nuggety Reef. This shaft was sunk by
the Perseverance Company, who obtained 9 oz. of gold to the ton at 330 feet in
depth; from 1 oz. to 1 oz. 5 dwt. to the ton of quartz raised from 450 and 460
feet; 1 oz. 15 dwt. 18 gr. of gold from 651 tons got from 510 feet in depth; and
good yields from various other considerable depths.
Scarcely a shaft has been sunk below the water-level on any of the other reefs,
although many of them have proved very rich above that level, as will be seen at
page 162. The quartz of the veins above the water line is of a dull vitreous
appearance; the natural fractures of the veinstone are more or less covered by
ferruginous clay and oxide of iron, which latter is at times a full inch in thickness,
and very little pyrites is visible.
Galena occurs in small quantities with fine gold in the solid quartz in the
Doctor’s Reef at the White Hills.
The following particulars respecting an interesting fault of the Nuggety Reef
are obtained from an official report supplied by Mr. H. B. Nicholas, the late mining
surveyor of the subdivision:—
“The reef was opened about the year 1857 on the eastern
side of the fault {see Plan, Fig. 3), and upon that sido >
during the greater portion of the time, has been regularly
and prosperously worked. Many unsuccessful attempts were
made to find the reef on the western side ; shafts were
sunk where any trace of a quartz vein existed, exhausting
the patience and purses of the claimholders by repeated
failures, until February 1864, when Fisher and Co., who
had steadily prospected the ground, struck a vein at 210
FIG. 3.
feet north from where the fault commences in Anderson’s claim, and further
development proved it to he the continuation of the same quartz vein. After
making a survey I found that the bearing and underlie were similar, the width of
the quartz vein (from 2 to 3 feet) the same; and, more fortunate coincidence,
the quartz crushed yielded from 1 oz. to 3 oz. of gold to the ton, which was
about the range of produce in the opposite claim. ‘ Breaks ’ in the underlie of a
similar character also existed.




“ A slide or cross-course of decomposed clay slate crosses the hill transversely,
the walls, which were from 12 to 20 inches apart, were polished, and in both claims
the quartz terminated abruptly at each wall of the ‘cross-course.’”
Ten shafts were sunk in unsuccessful attempts to find the continuation of this
reef, and the patience and means of the claimholders were exhausted; but
they both might have been spared from exhaustion had they known a little
more of the results of vein-mining in other countries. In Cornwall, for example,
many more right-hand than left-hand heaves are known, i.e., the prospects of
finding a vein are better in driving along a cross-course to the right than to the
left. The late Mr. W. J. Henwood’s records show that out of 215 cases of inter-
section of lodes by cross-courses 181, or more than 84 per cent., were found by
driving on the side of the greater angle, and only 34, or less than 16 per cent., on
the side of the smaller angle. It will thus be seen that the chances are more
than five to one that the vein will be found on the same side as the larger
angle.
Another rule which should be well known is that the flatter the underlie of a
vein that is faulted the greater the distance the vein will be faulted.* The under-
lie of tho Nuggety Reef is very flat, as will be seen in Figure 4, and the faulted
distance is 210 feet.
This fault in the Nuggety Reef fully supports these rules, and it is not the only
example in Victoria, for I have now collected several other exemplifications, par-
ticulars of which I purpose publishing in a future paper in continuation of my
“Notes on some characteristics of auriferous quartz reefs or veins” which appeared
in Progress Report, No. IV.
In a large open cutting on the Nuggety Reef
was exposed a section of the vein of which
Figure 4 is a sketch made by myself on the 9th
September 1867.
At the time of my recent visit I found that this
cutting was partly filled up, the sides had fallen
in, and the section of the vein was no longer
visible. The depth of the lower break or slide
FIG. 4.
in the reef was about 6 feet, the length of the lowest part of the vein open to
view was about 20 feet, and the dip or underlie of the reef was about 10 feet
in 6 feet.
The above sketch-section, Figure 4, not only illustrates the breaks or slides in the
Nuggety Reef, but it is also typical of the Specimen Hill Reef, the Lima, South
Devon, Belfast, and the Union Reef, all of which dip at a similar rate between the
slides, to the north. The same, or a like motion in the strata, appears to have
broken the whole of these reefs, which, it is worthy of mention, have proved to be
the richest veins at Rushworth.
Another remarkable vein is the Fossil Reef, which derives its name from the
numerous casts of Upper Silurian fossils which it contains. The stone crushed con-
sists of a porous quartzite, many of the numerous cavities in which are undoubtedly
produced by the absence of the fossils which were at one time entombed in the
rock.

The following account of yields of gold from veinstone crushed have been
extracted from the Mining Registrar’s quarterly reports. From them an idea can
be formed of the past richness of some of the quartz reefs: —
From the Specimen Hill Reef 1,092 oz. of gold were obtained from 228 tons
of quartz crashed.
The Union Reef yielded 265 oz. of gold from 20 tons of quartz.
The Mongolian Reef gave a yield of 19 oz. to the ton of quartz from 160 feet
in depth, and 17 oz. per ton at 200 feet, and from 4 to 6 oz. of gold per ton
were got from quartz raised from 220 and 256 feet in depth.
The Frenchman’s and Welcome Reefs have yielded very rich stone above the
water-level; the latter as much as 24 oz. of gold to the ton of quartz.
The Main Gully Reef gave 12 oz. to the ton for 40 tons crushed.
From the Growler’s Reef 136 oz. of gold were obtained from 45 tons of
quartz.
The Cockatoo Reef yielded 11 oz. to the ton.
The Scrub Reef gave 3 oz. of gold to the ton.
Crocker’s Reef; quartz from this vein yielded at different times 22 oz. 11 dwt.
per ton (and before this crushing was made the owners took about 60 oz. of
gold from the quartz in specimens), 23 oz. to the ton, 59 oz. to the ton, and some
of the stone raised from below 200 feet was estimated to yield as high as 100
oz. of gold to the ton.
Intersections of east and west and north and south veins occur at Dunlop’s
or View Hill (Dunlop’s and Westlake’s reefs), and at Growler’s Hill, Rush-
worth, at Balaclava Hill, and in the U. and F. Antimony Company’s mine
(Albert Reef and antimony vein), Whroo, and at Cherry-tree Diggings, south of
Coy’s.
Mr. T. W. Benbow has supplied me with the following additional facts and
interesting remarks respecting quartz gold and the reefs in the Waranga dis-
trict :
“ Quartz gold is always brought to the banks ready for sale, being melted
by the crushing machine proprietors. It varies very much in quality from the
different reefs, the alloy being almost exclusively silver. * * * All gold
in this district when impure by the admixture of any other metals than silver or
antimony is the result of accidental circumstances, the reefs seeming to be abso-
lutely free from the base metals in a form capable of readily amalgamating during
the process of crashing the quartz. Even the admixture of antimony in melted
gold is the result of careless washing of the amalgam and the subsequent reduction
of the sulphide of antimony in the melting pot.
“ I have detected copper in the London Reef, at Coy’s Diggings, but only as a
carbonate, and in very small quantity. Zinc occurs in many reefs under the form
of ‘Black Jack ’ of the miners. Lead is present in the shape of galena ; iron as
crystallized sulphide or pyrites. But all these ores are found principally under
water-level, which I place at an average depth of 240 feet.
“The assay of quartz gold varies between 21'0| of Clarke’s Reef, at Siberia,
and 23-2§ of the Whistler’s Reef, Coy’s Diggings, which, with Balaclava Hill gold,
I think I may place as the finest gold in the district.
“ The quality of the alluvial gold in each gully varies, so that it is almost impos-
sible to find two alike, and the quality of the gold seems to be determined by that


of the reef or reefs at its head or in the vicinity. But it is always a little better
than the gold in the reefs so situated, owing probably to the large surface presented
by the multitude of particles of gold for the action of water and air, by which the
silver present becomes in course of time oxidized and lost (to the miner), thus
rendering the bulk of the gold purer.
“ This is the only theory upon which I can account for the well established fact
that the fine ‘flour’ gold obtained principally by Chinamen from quartz tailings
is always the purest to be met with in the district; and this, notwithstanding the
fact that such quartz when originally crushed, it may be years before, contained
gold of a very inferior quality. There are many instances which could be cited,
but I will mention the most striking.
“ The Perseverance Company, South Nuggety Reef, crushed their own quartz
for some years. The average quality of their gold was 21 - 2-|; but, after lying for
several years, the tailings were worked by a party of Chinamen, with large quick-
silver cradles, and blankets or canvas catches, and the average assay of the gold
thus produced was 23 • 3|, or at 775. standard worth 83s. per oz., or only 6s. Bd.
less than absolutely pure gold.
“In the case of quartz tailings the oxidization of the silver would go on much
more rapidly than in the case of alluvial gold, because the ‘flour’ gold is in so finely
a divided state that when the silver on the surface of each particular atom had been
reached that portion still remaining in the interior of such atom would seem to be
a very small quantity. Besides, in this case there may be other causes operating
to produce the same effect. For instance, it is well known that the iron pyrites
contained in once worked tailings, after lying for some years, become wholly or
partly decomposed, and by thus setting free the gold they contain often render the
tailings capable of being worked again. It may be then, and probably is a fact,
that when the pyrites are decomposed by the action of air and water, a portion of the
sulphur and oxygen goes to form sulphuric acid, which not only acts upon the
silver on the surface of any particle of gold it may meet with, but penetrates some
distance under the surface, or in the case of a very attenuated particle even through
it, converting all the silver it meets into a sulphate, which is subsequently washed
away and lost.

STRIKE, DIP, AND WIDTH OF SOME OF THE QUARTZ REEFS NEAR RUSH-
WORTH, AND THE DEPTH OF SHAFTS SUNK ON THE REEFS.




QUARTZ MINING AT WHROO.
The auriferous reefs at Whroo, in general terms, may be said to differ but little
from those at Rushworth. The only noticeable exceptions are the Balaclava Hill
veins, the Albert Beef, and the Stockyard Reef. In each of these lodes the occur-
rence of antimony veins, or the association of antimony ores in the auriferous veins,
is a marked feature.
The most considerable mining operations at Whroo have been carried on at the
Balaclava mine, from which it has been estimated that considerably more than
£150,000 worth of gold has been extracted. Mr. John T. Lewis, one of the pro-
prietors, has supplied me with the following particulars of this mine, in a letter
dated 20th October 1877 :
“The mine was opened in May 1855, and the main shaft is now down 450 feet.
The strata run east and west, and the whole hill is intersected with north and
south and east and west veins (the latter running with the strata). Where these
veins cut one another they are generally very rich, but vary much in thickness. All
the north and south veins underlie to the west and the east and west to the north.
“Last week we crushed 25 loads from a thickness of 10 feet at the 196-foot level,
which gave 36 oz. of gold. We also crushed 150 tons from the Mary Reef,
which gave 56 oz. This reef (the Mary) runs north-west and south-east. It
is situated to the east of the old Balaclava Reef, and underlies to the east. The
1 Mary ’ intersects the Balaclava Reef. The crushing of quartz above mentioned
was taken frem the reef, where it averages 7 feet in width. One very peculiar
thing about the ‘ Mary ’ is the fact that the gold in it is so poor, only worth about
£3 15s. per oz., while only a few yards away the Balaclava gold, in either E. and
W. or N. and S. veins, is worth on the average £4 2s. 6d. per oz.”
An interesting and elaborate report on the numerous veins that have been dis-
covered in the Balaclava mine was prepared for the proprietors, a few years since, by
Mr. George H. F. Ulrich, F.G.S. The extracts from this report which follow will
afford a good idea of the peculiar intermixture of quartz and antimony veins in this
prominent hill:—
“ From the mode of occurrence of the different quartz veins opened in your ground
it appears that, from the top of the Balaclava Hill, an auriferous zone, following
spurs of the range, extends from E. and W. along the strike of the rocks, which
consist of Upper Silurian sandstone. Westward of the hill, for about six chains
to the point where the spur commences to slope off into an auriferous flat, this zone
has been proved richest, and is characterized by a network of quartz veins, which
can be distinguished as belonging to three systems ;
“Ist. East and west veins, dipping rather steeply (about 70°), with the rocks
northward, and appearing neither well-defined nor permanent in depth or strike.
They are rarely above a few inches in thickness, but several worked out in the
large open cutting on top of the range have proved highly auriferous, whilst one
is at present being worked by tributers on western point of spur.
“2nd. Cross veins varying in strike from N. 15° to 25° E., and underlying west-
ward at a mean angle of about 65°. These are the main auriferous veins of the
Balaclava Hill mine, and especially to one nearest the top of the hill. The so-
called “ Balaclava Reef ” has, on account of its extraordinary richness from the top


downward to a depth exceeding 300 feet, established the fame of the district. This
vein is not, however, well-defined as regards walls and casing, and showed in the
portion worked many irregularities both in strike and dip, whilst its thickness
varied in places from less than an inch to above two feet. Besides this main cross
vein another small one, likewise auriferous, has just been opened in a cutting
intended for a powder magazine on the south side of the spur, and still further
west, on the north side of the spur, was the so-called “ Anglo-French Reef,” which
has been worked and traced for several claims up the slope to very near the crest of
the spur. Excellent returns are said to have been obtained from this vein by
several small parties of miners that originally opened it, but on account of the gold
more or less disappearing in depth it has for some years been neglected, though
certainly deserving further examination.
“ 3rd. The veins of the third system, called the flat veins, intersect the east and
west and cross veins just mentioned at a variable strike intermediate with theirs,
and dip throughout at very flat angles, varying between nearly horizontal and
hardly 20°, mostly northward. Although these flat veins are in the average
stronger and better defined than the other two kinds of veins, they have, with
the exception of one small vein worked in the open cutting, not proved payably
auriferous.
“ Touching the geological relations of the three systems of veins, it appears that
the E. and W. and cross veins are of the same age, as at their intersection the
identity of either is lost, and no trace of faulting is perceptible, whilst the “ flat
veins” seem younger than both, because they can be plainly traced through and
sometimes slightly fault them.
“ The chief workings of the mine are those in the main cross vein—the
‘ Balaclava Reef.’ * * * * Both these main workings follow the vein—the
first southward, the last northwards—to its disappearance in strike in a kind of
tough bluish-grey sandstone, the favorite rock for gold, intermediate being a softer
sandstone of a greyish-white or brownish color and rather argillaceous character.
“As regards the mode of occurrence of the gold in the reef, it seems from the
workings that it lies in two shoots and a small attached patch. * * * And it
was observed, more especially in the northern shaft, that the richest quartz inva-
riably occurred at points where the reef showed irregularities, as bends, &c., in its
course.
“ Touching the portion of the reef between the two shoots, it is also auriferous,
but not considered rich enough for working.”
Further on in his report Mr. Ulrich refers to a small E. and W. vein, and to
several small N. and S. veins.
In the 290-foot level, he says, the reef increases in thickness to nearly 2 feet,
and assumes a greater regularity in strike and dip, besides being strongly charged
with sulphide of antimony. A small antimony vein (E. and W.), carrying a little
gold, is also mentioned as occurring a few feet above this level.
He also states :—“A review of the prospects of the reef in the workings connected
with this level, both north and south of the shaft, renders it thus evident that
both shoots lose their payable auriferous character about the same horizon. * *
In a cross-cut, at about 360 feet in depth, there were signs of apparently the
commencement of a new rich shoot, which would lie intermediate between the
two shoots worked at shallower levels.”


Mr. Lewis has furnished me with the following information respecting the
Stockyard, Peep-o’-Day, and Happy-go-Lucky reefs :
“ The Stockyard Reef was originally worked for gold; the antimony ore in it
was only found in patches, which were crushed, and some turned out very good. It
was not then (some years since) considered payable, being so patchy.
“ The Peep-o’-Day was also originally worked for gold. Some fine parcels of
antimony ore from this reef have been sent to Melbourne and realized a good
price.
“About 160 yards to the west of the last-named reef is a diorite dyke, which is
about 20 feet in width. It runs N. 5° E., the walls being apparently perpen-
dicular. I have sunk in it over 30 feet, and found no change, but purpose giving
it a further trial.”
“The Happy-go-Lucky, after being idle for a long time, has been started by
Hodge Brothers. They have just finished a crushing of 8 tons, and got 33 oz. of
gold.”
The Albert Reef, which is
next in importance to the Bala-
clava, is situated to the east of
the latter-named reef. It strikes
N. 87° E., is very nearly vertical,
having but a slight northerly dip,
and varies in thickness from 1 or
2 inches up to 12 feet.
At the time of my visit to the
Albert Reef the U. and F. An-
timony Company were raising
antimony ore and gold-bearing
quartz from their mine. They
then had several tons of the ore
stacked at the surface, and were
crushing the quartz, which did
not contain much antimony. I
went underground and inspected
their mining operations, as they
FIG. 5.
Longitudinal Section, Francis and Co’s. Claim, Albert
Reef, Whroo.
were then at work on the junction of the antimony lode with the golden reef ; and
I thought the junction of the two veins was likely to afford some facts that would
prove worthy of notice. The section (Fig. 5) shows the dip of the shoot of gold in
this mine and the positions of the antimony lode at the 140-foot and 200-foot levels.
The plan (Fig. 6) of the reef at the 140-foot level represents the manner in
which the reef bulged out where the shoot of gold occurred.
FIG. 6.
This is an example of the shoot of gold conforming to the dip of the shoot of
quartz. The reef diminishes in thickness to the west of the shoot of stone; and,
although the quartz contained some gold, there was so little quartz —nowhere more
than two inches —that it would not pay to work.


The manager (who courteously guided me through the claim) is of opinion that
a new shoot of auriferous quartz will be discovered beneath that which has been
wrought, and he informed me that they purpose sinking the shaft with the object
of intersecting the antimony reef and testing the ground where the two veins are
likely to come in contact at a greater depth.
The Albert Reef strikes east and west, whilst
the antimony vein for about 12 feet in length on
each side of it ran at right angles, or north and
south, and then appeared to be taking a course to
the north-east and south-west, as indicated by dotted
lines on the plan (Fig. 7), of the veins at the 200-
foot level.
The antimony vein is evidently of more recent
formation than the Albert, as it divides it at 160
feet in depth and throws or faults it to the north
about 2 feet. At the 200-foot level the Albert
FIG. 7.
Reef is cut off by the antimony, and its continuation to the east has not yet been
observed.
The antimony vein dips to the west about 15 inches in 6 feet, and the Albert Reef
slightly to the north.
Since my visit the manager, Mr. Wm. Uren, has informed me that the winze at
the junction of the two veins has been sunk 10 feet, the quantity of antimony
slightly increasing, and the gold showing freely in the quartz. The quartz and
antimony are found to form alternately as the winze is sunk.
The undermentioned particulars of assays which have been kindly supplied by
Mr. T. W. Benbow give the average results of gold obtained from some of the
principal reefs

At the White Hills, which lie to the west of Whroo about three miles {see plan

through the richness of their yields. These reefs may be said to be a continuation
of those at Whroo, for, like them, they have a general strike east and west in
conformity with the strata in which they occur.
The following particulars of some of the reefs at this place were kindly given me
by Mr. John T. Lewis, of Whroo :

attained is 300 feet. It runs with the strata (which are very soft), and averages
18 inches in thickness. The total amount of quartz crushed out of this reef is
790 loads, which yielded 1,731 oz. 11 dwt. 12 gr., or an average yield of
2 oz. 6 dwt. The lowest yield 1 oz. to the load, and the highest 88 oz. from one
load. The reef has a very hard cement back.”
“The Black Reef runs east and west diagonally across the strata, with an
underlie of 3 feet in 5 feet. The average thickness of this reef is 3 feet. It was
opened about the year 1859. The perpendicular depth of the deepest workings is
220 feet. The highest yield was 16 oz. to the ton, the average 1 oz. 10 dwt. up
to 1874, and the late yields have been from 1 oz. 6 dwt. to 9 dwt. to the ton.
“Jerry’s Reef was opened in 1861, and runs about north and south, averaging
20 inches in thickness ; the highest yield was 5 oz. 10 dwt., and the lowest
6 dwt. 12 gr. The greatest depth of works is 50 feet.
“Woodward’s Reef was opened in 1874; it runs east and west; its average
thickness is 18 inches ; the first crushing from the surface of 14 tons gave 88 oz.
of gold, but the yield from the quartz gradually decreased as the quartz was got
from deeper in the reef.
“ The Rose of Denmark Reef was also opened in 1874 ; it runs east and west; its
width averages about 12 inches ; the highest yield from it was 22 oz. of gold to the
ton, and the lowest 1 oz. 5 dwt.; it has not been worked below 40 feet.”

Quaetz Mining at Cot’s Diggings.
Coy’s Diggings, as it is called, was discovered by Messrs. Coy, Anderson, and
Brian in September 1864. The mining operations have been principally carried on
upon quartz veins, which extend from Coy’s Eeef northwards to the London Reef,
a distance of between two and three miles. The works on the Byron, Canadian,
Great Eastern, Hick’s, Welcome, Murray, Essex, and London reefs, form nearly
one continuous line in the intervening space between the two first-mentioned
veins.
The prevailing strike of the reefs is north and south, although there are two
cross reefs, viz., Coy’s and the Hit-or-Miss.
The quartz in the veins shows polished faces and striation. These signs of
attrition are specially observable in the veinstone of the London Eeef. In the
quartz from this reef too I observed a little blue carbonate of copper.
The depth of the water-level at Coy’s is about 150 feet.
Slate rooks are more prevalent on this diggings and at Cherry-tree Flat than at
either Whroo or Eushworth.
The following facts have been supplied to me by Mr. F. S. Pollon, respecting
the reefs now at work at these diggings
Byron’s Eeef was opened in December 1864, in Messrs. Martin and Scanlan’s
claim ; on this reef the highest yield obtained was 9 oz. per ton, and the average
yield is 1 oz. 5 dwt.
Welcome Eeef.—Opened in February 1865. In Myers and Co.’s claim the
highest yield -was 28 oz. per ton, and the average yield 2 oz. 10 dwt.
London Eeef.—Opened in June 1865. In Judson and Co.’s claim the highest
yield was 8 oz. 10 dwt. 8 gr., and the average yield is 3 oz. 10 dwt. per ton.
Taylor and Murry’s Eeef.—Opened in 1865 ; now the Black Cloud Company.
The highest yield of gold per ton was 3 oz. 15 dwt., and the average yield is
2 oz. 10 dwt.
Morning Star Reef.—Opened in 1865. In Apperman Company’s claim the
highest yield was 1 oz. 5 dwt., and the average yield is 15 dwt. per ton.
Whistler’s Eeef.—Opened in 1873. In Groombridge and Co.’s claim the highest
yield was 3 oz. 10 dwt., and the average is 2 oz. per ton.

Quartz Mining at Cheeet-teee Flat.
The gold workings at this place lie to the south of and adjacent to Coy’s Diggings.
They were discovered by H. Hyam in February 1865. The reefs here extend from
the Homeward-hound by the Cousin Jack Reef southwards beyond the Brighton
Reef. Numerous quartz reefs have been mined, and many of them have yielded
payable returns.
In the vicinity of this field many auriferous quartz reefs have been discovered
and more or less worked. Quite recently two reefs have been opened out in the
southern high ranges, not far from the Gloulburn River, and distant two miles from
each other. One of them yielded, so I was informed, 20 oz. of gold to the ton
of quartz, but was only wrought to a depth of 30 feet.

Qtjaetz Mining at Fontainbleau.
At this place the quartz reefs are situated on high ground to the south of the
alluvial workings at the Nine-mile Creek, and these reefs are probably the sources
from which the auriferous deposits at the latter diggings were derived.
Thompson’s Reef yielded at 50 feet in depth nearly 3 oz. of gold to the ton,
and many other crushings comprising some hundreds of tons of quartz were raised
from this reef and yielded remunerative quantities of gold.
As yet the numerous quartz veins in the neighborhood of Fontainbleau are
quite undeveloped, and all quartz mining has now ceased.
Outcrops and indications of quartz reefs are not wanting in the large extent of
country lying between the head of Spring Creek and Fontainbleau, and between
the latter-named place and Whroo.
Evidence of the existence of quartz reefs is also observable in the Buffalo
Ranges, and as alluvial gold is found in payable quanties in the gullies there can
be little doubt that the ranges themselves will be found to contain auriferous
veins.
Mr. Benbow says the average assay of the Dawn of Hope Reef, at Fontainbleau,
from Thompson’s claim, was 22 - 2|, and of Clarke’s Reef, at Siberia, from Clarke’s
mine, was 21 - of.
At Friesland (which place I have previously referred to under the head of
alluviums at page 158) the Proud Salopian Reef was found to contain large quan-
tities of auriferous pyrites.
Antimont Oee.
This ore occurs as oxide or sulphide in a large number of veins in the district
and in localities wide apart.
At Whroo antimony occurs in four veins, all of them auriferous or associated
with gold-bearing quartz reefs. The richest vein is the Stockyard, which strikes
N. 59° E., is very nearly vertical, and like all antimony veins is ever varying


in width. It bunches out to two feet in the widest parts and contracts to a mere
thread, but its average thickness may be set down at about eight inches. The vein
has not been worked below the water-level. The ore occurs in distinct blocks,
having a nucleus of sulphide surrounded by concentric rings of cream-colored oxide
of antimony. Pieces of slate of precisely the same character and appearance as
that adjoining the vein are enclosed by the antimony ore in the same manner as
auriferous quartz reefs in districts situated in Lower Silurian rocks are found to
include pieces of the bounding strata, I have also observed in specimens from this
vein pieces of quartz enveloped by the antimony ore in a like manner to the nucleus
of sulphide above-mentioned.
Fine specimens of the oxide of antimony containing heavy bits of gold embedded
in them have been got from this reef.
The main reef in the Balaclava Hill mine contains quantities of antimony ore in
addition to gold, and Mr. Ulrich, in his report on this mine, says—“A few feet above
the level (290 feet) in the open workings a small east and west antimony vein
carrying a little gold is exposed.”
The antimony vein which intersects the Albert Reef in the U. and F. Antimony
Company’s mine, at Whroo, strikes in a north and south direction, and dips slightly
to the west (see Figs. 4,5, and 6). The manager of this mine informs me that
the vein increases in width through the footwall bulging out, and that the quartz
and antimony are found to occur in alternate blocks in the lode as the winze
is sunk to greater depths.
Mr. Lewis says that some fine parcels of antimony ore have been sent to
Melbourne which were raised from the Peep-o’-Day Beef, and that the ore realized
a good price.
Mr. Benbow states that “ antimony is present in many reefs throughout the
district, but only in one or two places in paying qualities and quantity.”
“It is found as a sulphide and yellow oxide in paying quantities at Whroo,
in the Balaclava, Albert, and Stockyard reefs, and at Coy’s Diggings, in the
Black Cloud Reef. The only vein now being worked is that intersecting the
Albert Reef, Whroo. It occurs in connection with a gold-bearing quartz vein.
The quartz is ‘cobbed off’ and crushed, and the antimony ore either shipped to
England or sold in Melbourne. A lot of 21 tons sent home by me realized
£lss. 10s. per ton.
“ It is noticeable that gold found in association with antimony is always of a
superior quality. For instance, the best assaying gold comes from the following
reefs :—Balaclava, Stockyard, Albert, Frenchman’s, Growler’s, Mason’s, Welcome,
Whistler’s, &c., which all contain antimony in more or less quantity, but it requires
some care and trouble in the manipulation of the amalgam before retorting and
melting to obtain the gold in its native purity. If there is any sulphide or oxide
of antimony left with the amalgam it is reduced when it comes in contact with the
carbon of the melting crucible or the charcoal of the fire, and thus causes the
melted gold to be impure.”
Two veins containing antimony ore occur about three miles to the south of the
conglomerate fossiliferous range (referred to in the beginning of this report). These
veins were discovered and worked for gold nearly twenty years since by the
Messrs. Hamilton. The southern vein, which strikes N. 83° W., has been most

extensively wrought. The depth of the shaft on the underlie is about 300 feet.
The vein varied from 15 to 20 inches in width. It consisted principally of the
sulphide of antimony, although the oxide occurred, and gold is said to have
been found mostly associated with the latter. The strike of the northern vein is
N. 78° W.
At Coy’s Diggings sulphide and oxide of antimony have been obtained in the
Inifer and in the Murray reefs. These reefs may by further exploration, however,
prove to be a continuation of the same vein. They have hitherto been only wrought
for gold.
In concluding this report, I must state that for a considerable part of the
statistical and other information contained in it I am indebted to the published
reports of the several mining registrars who have held office in the subdivision
since the year 1860, viz.:—Messrs. H. B. Nicholas, Breen, Walsh, and Hicks; and

LABORATORY NOTES.
Phosphates.
In the brown iron ores (impure limonite), from nearly all points in South Gipps-
land, I have noted the almost constant presence of phosphates of lime, alumina,
and iron, and in one instance, a clayey bog ore, a soluble alkaline phosphate, was
found; while in the similar iron ores from other parts of Victoria, as at Lai Lai,
Castlemaine, Newstead, Seymour, and Benalla, phosphates are almost wholly
absent. Having some specimens of the rock taken from close to the railway line
near Brandy Creek, which Mr. Ulrich recognized as closely resembling the rock
from near Bairnsdale in which vivianite was found, at his suggestion an analysis
was made of it, and phosphates were found in notable quantity. Further samples
of rock and soil gave similar results ; at the same time it was found that the
rock, a yellow and grey soft earthy sandstone, disintegrating rapidly when ex-
posed to the weather, also contained soluble silicates and salts of potash, soda.

and ammonia. I suggested to some persons taking up land in the district that they
should try some crops on the yellow and grey soil derived from these rocks, and
am now informed by some who did try the experiment that these despised soils
have produced excellent returns, and that for some crops they are fully equal to the
much prized chocolate soil of Brandy Creek. These rocks occur over a very large
part of South Gippsland, and instead of being valueless, as is generally supposed
they may, and probably are, well suited for the farmer ; and I would suggest that
specimens should be collected throughout the district, and tested qualitatively.
Similar rocks occur in the Cape Otway district, and may also contain the elements
necessary for a good agricultural soil. In former reports I have noted the occur-
rence of phosphates, as nodules and thin veins, in clayey rocks from near Port
Albert and at Bruthen Creek.
Lignite.
Numerous specimens of lignite from near the Gippsland railway have been
received from the department and from private persons. They all take the character
of the lignite at Crossover Creek, and will some day be of value as furnace fuel.
Some are highly bituminous, and will be useful for the manufacture of gas for
illuminating purposes. One sample received from the Honorable J. Woods was
nearly equal to the average Hartley shale as a source of gas. In the laboratory
experiment with it the gas came off readily, and had a high illuminating power.
Other samples, not from the same place, but in the vicinity of the above, gave a
poor gas, containing a very great quantity of ammonia. Others, again, give no
gas. They do not bum with any flame, and while smouldering give off ammonia
so freely that it may be detected by the smell, and if burnt in an acid atmosphere
the ammoniacal fumes rising from the coal have all the appearance of a white
smoke : this is true also of some samples from the Western district.
Guano.
During the year the guano caves at Skipton have been opened, and the guano
sold to the farmers. An average of several analyses gave me—
Water (hygroscopic) ... ... ... ... 23 - 26
Organic matter ... ... ... ... 49‘48
Strurite—Ammonio-magnesian phosphate ... ... 16'48
Hydrous phosphate of lime ... ... ... 5'68
Sand ... ... ... ... ... 1-70
Alkaline chlorides and sulphates ... ... 3‘40
100-00
Its main value is due to the presence of the mineral strurite—a mineral rarity—
and to the still more rare mineral, a hydrous phosphate of lime. Some similar
deposits occur in the caves in the Western district, but I believe that they contain
so much organic matter, and are so moist, that they are not much esteemed by the
farmers.
Rocks.
A careful examination of the various rocks is being continued. The collection
of sandstones mentioned in my last report has been added to considerably by new


and duplicate samples. The sandstones, which so far appear to resist atmospheric
action most completely are, first, Stawell stone, from Watkins’ quarry. A six-inch
cube of white fine-grained sandstone, very hard, has been subjected to alternate moist
and dry atmospheres, been saturated with saline solutions and then exposed to the
summer sun without any change ; the polished surface still remains perfect. The
quarry from which this sample was taken, some six or seven years ago, has been visited
by Mr. Ulrich, and is now being opened. Specimens brought down by Mr. Ulrich
show that there is a constant passage of silica from the inner to the outer or ex-
posed parts. He obtained specimens from parts of the old quarry which had not
been worked for some years, and found thick silicious coatings, or rather satura-
tions, for the rock is rendered almost vitreous, in some cases, nearly two inches
from the surface ; the thickness of this layer depending on the length of exposure,
and probably the mass of rock from which the silica (or silicate of ammonia?) was
to be drawn by the surface evaporation.
Next, and perhaps equal to the Stawell sample, is a block of stone from Briago-
long, Gippsland. The Mansfield stone, a white medium-grained hard sandstone,
is also of excellent quality, and at present shows no sign of decay or change, other
than becoming whiter on exposure.
Many of the others have failed completely, but it may be unfair to condemn the
quarries on the failure of a single sample. An instance of this is shown in the
sample of stone from Dunkeld, Mount Abrupt. It was selected with so little care
and judgment that it has failed to stand the test of alternate wetting and drying,
and I am certain that quite as durable stone may be had from that locality as from
Stawell.
The examination of our basaltic rocks is being continued in the Museum labora-
tory by Mr. Ulrich, and as an aid to the microscopic examination of the thin
sections of the rocks he has introduced into the laboratory Professor Szaba’s most
beautiful method of flame reactions, which gives a ready means of determining
doubtful felspars. By these methods he has made an examination for me of basalts
from Learmonth, Nos. 4692 (A > and 4637, collected by Mr. Norman Taylor, field
geologist. He finds No. 4692 Wto be a light-bluish grey anamesite, rendered
slightly porphyritio by irregular colorless transparent patches of a striated felspar
and crystalline olivine. The rook inclines more to the trachytic than the basaltic
series. The examination of the sections under the microscope proved the felspar
patches to he without exception plagioclase, and that there is a great deal of
isotropic clear glass base, forming larger and smaller portions of irregular outline
between the crystalline minerals, which, besides the felspar, consist of olivine in
considerable proportion, occasionally forming pretty perfect, though very much
fractured, crystals ; magnetite, or titaniferous iron, sometimes recognizable as octa-
hedral crystals, but for the most part of irregular outline ; augite, very scarce, in
light-brown irregular crystals.
An examination by the flame reactions above referred to prove the felspar to be
labradorite.
The next specimen, No. 4637, is also of considerable interest, as it contains
quartz and a potash felspar porphyritically distributed through the rock. Mr.
Ulrich describes it as a black dense basalt of rather dull aspect, rendered porphy-
ritic by opaque white grains of partly regular and partly irregular crystalline outline
of felspar, a few glassy looking ones, apparently quartz, and greenish grains of


olivine. The reactions of the rock section under the microscope prove it to consist
mainly of an isotropic brown glass base, in part devitrifled and full of microlites of
plagioclase, small grains of olivine, and crystals of magnetite (titaniferous iron ?),
showing in arrangement fluidal structure. Of the glassy and white opaque grains
porphyritically distributed through the rock, the former prove to he quartz, but as
regards the latter the entire absence of twin striation and colored bands in polarized
light point to its being a monoolinic or orthoclastic species of felspar, and this
result is confirmed by examination of the mineral by flame reactions, which unmis-
takably proved it to be potash felspar, either orthoolase or sanidine ; its opaque-
ness and general aspect indicate it to be the former. As orthoclase felspar is
extremely rare in basalts, and when found has usually been identified as sanidine,
the occurrence in this instance of true orthoolase must appear the more strange and
interesting ; but considering that Mr. Norman Taylor states in his report that this
basalt comes from a point of eruption which has broken through a deposit of
granite detritus, and taking into account the association of the felspar with genuine
quartz grains, the probability is that both were mechanically enclosed by the fluid
lava, though their uniform porphyritic distribution would remain an unexplained
very curious feature.
Auriferous Ores.
The most notable discovery of the year is the finding of gold in true granite at
Sandy Creek. Some of the specimens are very rich, and would assay several ounces
per ton. Gold in granite has often been reported, but on investigation it has
always been found to be a dioritic rock. In this instance we have, however, a true
granite, which, so far as its mineral components and general character are concerned,
closely resembles the variety of granite called “ protogine,” abundant in some parts
of the Alps.
Some quartz pebbles from Berlin goldfield, presented to the Museum collections
by Mr. Ogier, P.M., are especially worthy of note, as they contain gold in thin
films lining rusty cracks. The gold is evidently of much more recent origin
than the quartz. It seems probable that it has been deposited since the pebbles
were water-worn and while they formed portions of the drift from which they were
taken, proving the presence of auriferous waters in the drift at comparatively recent
times. The gold ores of Bethanga still continue of interest, most of the miners
finding cupreous ores below the water-level. Above water-level the ore consisted
of quartz with gold, metallic copper, carbonates and oxide of copper, and oxide of
iron. As these are worked out and the miners have had to undertake the treat-
ment of more complex ore—specimen No. 4844 is typical of a large number
that have been examined, and it may prevent much disappointment if the miners
will note that the copper and magnetic pyrites are almost free from gold, which is
contained almost if not wholly in the iron and arsenical pyrites. Though these
pyritous ores are apparently intimately mixed together, yet it is possible to effect a
separation to a very considerable degree by mechanical dressing. For some of the
ores this should begin with hand picking, and next passing the ores, after crushing,
over a proper dressing floor. If this was done there would be less difficulty in
getting the auriferous pyrites, and the copper ores would, at the same time, be
raised in standard. With other ores from these mines this mechanical separation is
2 B


impossible ; the mixture of copper pyrites with the auriferous arsenical and iron
pyrites is too intimate, and some other means must be adopted to save the gold.
Metallurgical treatment by directly smelting the ore and getting a copper regulus
has, I believe, been tried ; this regulus will contain most of the gold, but not all,
and the separation of the gold from it is a very expensive tedious operation. A
much more simple plan would be to prepare the ore for amalgamation, remove the
gold, and then, if desired, smelt the waste sand for copper; or, perhaps, as these are
not rich copper ores, an adaptation of Hunt and Douglass’s, Henderson’s, or Gibb’s
processes would be still cheaper ; taking the copper and silver out as chlorides
and leaving the gold with the oxide of iron, so that it may be easily obtained by
amalgamation. No metallurgical process which entails smelting operations can
possibly compete with the mechanical operation of amalgamation. The mechanical
contrivances to effect amalgamation of gold by mercury, no matter how fine the
gold is, may be called nearly perfect ; the difficulty now is to prepare the gold so
that it may be taken up by the mercury, and to so treat the ore that the mercury is
not “flowered” or converted into a sulphide during the operation. And I have no
doubt that, after a few trials, it will be found that, practically, the whole of the
gold, silver, and copper contained in the Bethanga ores may be easily saved without
any smelting operation, except in the case of the copper.
Several novelties in gold-saving methods and appliances have been brought
forward during the year, but before mentioning them it is well to see what is being
done by our well-known methods when carefully carried out. A very careful
examination was made of some samples of “ huddle ” pyrites sands —the same after
roasting in a reverberatory furnace and the waste from the amalgamators after the
gold had been extracted —received from the Port Phillip Mine, Clunes. The state-
ment of the assays and analysis is given in the schedule attached, Nos. 4851-4855,
from which it will be seen that, from a sand containing 6 oz. 17 dwt. 4’5 gr. of
gold per ton, the waste contained only 6 dwt. 12 gr. of gold per ton, or, in other
words there was a loss of between 4 and 5 per cent. ; and this loss is represented
greater than the actual, as there was said to be some concentration in collecting
the amalgamator waste. I do not think that there is a record of a higher percentage
return by any known process ; and so far as quartzose ores associated with only iron
and arsenical pyrites are concerned, I do not think it can be done much cheaper,
especially if the so-called waste products are saved. Mr. Henry Rosales, of
Walhalla, has devised a process by which he treats the pyrites sands of the
Walhalla Mining Company. In this process the pyrites is not roasted, but ground
to a fine slime and amalgamated. Mr. Rosales claims, I believe, that the cost of
grinding is less than that of roasting, and he does not find the loss of mercury
increased by its being distributed through the fine pyrites slime. Messrs. Chapman
and Edwards, of Sandhurst, have, I understand, adopted Plutner’s chlorine process,
and are said to obtain excellent results in treating the ordinary pyrites of Sandhurst.
Neither of these processes will, however, deal with auriferous ores containing
sulphide of antimony, and, until very recently, many highly auriferous mines have
been stopped for want of a process which will extract gold from ores containing
sulphide of antimony. Some time since a method was devised for treating rich
antimonial ores by fusing the sulphide with a proportion of metallic antimony; the
latter having a great affinity for gold takes it up, and, on cooling, may be easily
separated from the sulphide, which may then be smelted into antimony. The same


quantity of metallic antimony is used with fresh charges of the ore till it has
become rich in gold ; the two metals are then separated by the oxidation of the
antimony. This process, though suitable to rich antimony ores, will not answer
with the poorer ores that are too silicious to fuse, and are, therefore, of no value to
the antimony smelter (ores under 30 per cent, of sulphide of antimony), and, owing
to the presence of this mineral, they cannot be treated for gold in the usual way.
These ores are sometimes utilized in making “ crude ” antimony, but many are too
poor in antimony for even this purpose, and, if placed in a furnace, simply fume, a
portion of the sulphide being converted into oxide. Many persons believe that if
this process is carried on in an oxidizing furnace that, ultimately, the antimony will
be wholly got rid of, and the gold left with the gangue or scoria to be extracted by
crushing and amalgamation; but this cannot be done. Upon examining the ore
treated in this manner it will be found that a very considerable quantity of antimony
remains, mostly in the metallic state ; even when exposed to a red heat in a rever-
beratory furnace, with a good current of air for some hours, there remained as much
as 6 per cent, of antimony by assay. This metallic antimony seems to be formed by
the reaction of the oxide or air on the sulphide ; thus, the parts of the ore first
charged into the hot furnace, or that part first acted on by the heat and hot air,
give off fumes of oxide which condense on the cool portions of the ore; then, as the
heat gains, the two compounds react on each other, producing metal and sulphurous
acid ; or, if there is any accumulation of fluid sulphide, formed by the running
together of quantities from different parts of the ore, hot air passing over it will,
by a similar reaction, produce metal. This metal will take up any gold it comes in
contact with, and cannot be treated by any amalgamation process. Another cause
of the failure of these attempts is that some of the metal is vaporized, and the vapor
of metallic antimony, like that of arsenic, is taken up by gold heated to near its
melting point, and the alloy so formed will not amalgamate. Again, sulphide of
antimony is always more or less vaporized in this process, and its vapor is readily
taken up by the hot gold. I do not know what the compound is in this case ;it
differs from the alloy of gold and antimony, formed by the action of the metal by
containing some sulphur ; it will not amalgamate with mercury, is very brittle, and
of a bronze color; probably a sulphide of gold and antimony. This compound may
always be seen in the auriferous scoria from crude furnaces, and is probably the
main cause of the loss of gold ; in the crushing operations it is reduced to a fine
slime and washes away ; it has a tendency to cleave into flakes, so that each particle
of the slime is a flake, and is thus more readily acted on by any current of water,
rendering it almost impossible to arrest its course by any of the ore-dressing
appliances. The ordinary alloy of gold and antimony has a similar but not so great
a tendency to cleave into flakes and float away with the quartz and substances of a
less specific gravity. For some time I have been experimenting with the view of
finding a process by the aid of which we might save both the gold and antimony
contained in these ores, and have now devised a method which seems to answer
well. The ore as it comes from the mine or the scoria from furnaces is placed in a
close furnace or kiln with an amount of salt or other chloride, and brought up to a
dull red heat ; steam is then introduced and continued until the whole or nearly the
whole of the antimony is got rid of. The bronze-colored alloy mentioned is decom-
posed, leaving clean bright gold. The quartz or gangue is rendered extremely
friable, the steam penetrating all parts of even the largest lumps that can be


conveniently handled in charging the furnace. The chloride of antimony formed comes
in contact with air on leaving the mass of ore and is converted into oxide, and the
sulphureted hydrogen is burnt at the same time; the oxide of antimony may then
be collected in suitable condensers. When the charge is removed from the furnace
it is crushed, and the gold may be saved by amalgamation. Trial lots of 5,8, and
15 tons have been tried with perfect success. Certain modifications of the above
are necessary with antimonial sands ; the steam is not so easily introduced into a
reverberatory furnace without bringing in an excess of air, but this may be done
by using a close furnace with automatic rakes, the rakes being perforated and
attached to the steam pipe are then used to distribute the steam in jets through the
mass of sand.
Other inventors have erected furnaces for roasting antimonial quartz tailings ; a
large revolving furnace has been erected at Costerfleld by Mr. H. Herrenschmidt,
and another furnace of a similar character aud intended for the same purpose,
devised by Mr. Borthwick, has been put up at South Costerfleld. These furnaces
are especially intended to save the antimony, and to work over large quantities of
sand; from 20 to 50 tons is said to be the estimated amount to be put through
daily. There are vast heaps of these sands or “tailings,” containing a large
percentage of antimony—they assay from 5 to 25 per cent. —but some difficulty
will be experienced with the old sands, those that have been exposed for many
years ; these do not contain any antimony as grey sulphide, the original ore ;it has
all been decomposed by atmospheric action. There are some sulphur compounds,
as may be seen by the colored bands shown where the heaps have been cut through,
but by far the greater part of the antimony is in the form of oxide, and most of the
sulphur is as sulphuric acid ; some of these sands are very acid—so much so that
they cannot be washed through iron gratings, the iron being quickly eaten away.
These decomposed tailings will need special treatment if the antimony is to be
got out by the furnaces recently erected. The cheapest method will probably be
to reduce the oxide they contain to metal and then roast, or perhaps, by using
charcoal with the charge, the two operations will go on in the same furnace. If
these plans are successful, a very large amount of antimony should be produced
during the coming year.
The importance of this subject to the colony may be judged of by the fact that
there are some mines which, with I believe only one exception, produce auriferous
antimony ore that does not yield up to the miners anything like half its gold
contents, and when worked for gold does not return any antimony.
Experiments on the deposition of gold are still being continued, but the results
are not ready for publication. It is extremely difficult to conduct experiments in
mines and guard against the almost numberless chances of error and mistake. For
this reason, all the results which apparently confirm the theory of the gold being
now in solution in mine waters and being now deposited are being rigidly examined
and repeated. I have, as yet, found no proof of the gold-carrier, i.e., the condition
in which it exists in the waters ; this problem becomes very interesting when we
find that if gold is associated with a metal like antimony, or its oxide or sulphide,
it cannot be separated by solution. Antimony and gold once associated are never
completely separated by any ordinary process of solution ; even the forms of
antimony used in medicine, such as tartar emetic, contain traces of gold. In the
waters of our mines we find antimonial compounds. In the heaps of waste tailings

at the mines we see the gradual decomposition of the sulphide of antimony and the
formation of concretionary nodules and layers of oxide and oxysulphide of
antimony, changes due to atmospheric causes, and with these larger quantities of
antimony smaller quantities of gold change position. In the saline crusts on the
heaps of “tailings ” I find nitrates with sulphates and chlorides, and free sulphuric
acid is continually supplied from the inner portions of the heap ; by such saline
and acid mixtures gold is, of course, easily dissolved. lam told that the masses
of crystalline copper found in the quartz lodes of the Lothair mine at Clunes
contain gold ; if so, this will be the first instance in which, to my knowledge, gold
—beyond a mere trace —has been found actually in the native copper. I have not
yet finished an examination of the copper specimens from this mine, but a sample
of native copper, consisting of a mass of octahedral crystals, given me by Mr.
Norman Taylor, which he obtained from the Lothair mine, contains only traces of
gold. This is very strange, for the causes which would deposit one metal should
also act on the other. In none of the copper specimens from St. Arnaud or
Bethanga reefs, or from the alluvial at Clunes, is there anything like plating or a
joint deposit of the two metals. Yet in these reefs and in the alluvial workings
there are all the elements necessary for causing galvanic action, and we find the
copper as metal by itself, and the gold as metal by itself, and in recent pyrites.
Waters.
The following determinations have been made of the amount of ammonia and
nitrogenous bodies in waters, in continuance of the work commenced last year by
Mr. Manley Hopwood and myself. That gentleman being otherwise engaged, I
have not been able to avail myself of his knowledge of this subject. The
determinations have been made by me and my assistant, Mr. Frederic Dunn. The
examination of the rain waters is being carried out in conjunction with records
made by Mr. Ellery, the Government Astronomer, who has kindly undertaken to
supply all the meteorological observations connected with the rainfall.

RESUME OF OPERATIONS OF PROSPECTING PARTIES.
Ballarat Mining District.
Blackwood Party.
This party consisted of J. Benford (foreman), D. Williams, P. Duncan, A.
McFarlane, and J. Pincombe, and commenced work on the 12th March, at Sardine
Creek. Prospecting this creek they obtained only a few fine colors of gold. The
depth of sinking ranged from 4 to 21 feet. The bed of the east branch of the
creek proved very shallow and rocky, and non-auriferous ; but at a large alluvial
flat, near, a few fine colors were obtained. Several quartz reefs in the vicinity
were prospected, but did not yield gold. No better result was obtained at
Jackson’s Creek and the south-west watershed. Husson’s Flat and the adjacent
gully were prospected. The depth of sinking on the flat was from 15 to 20
feet, and in one shaft fine colors of gold were obtained. Watties’ Gully, which
is about eight miles in length, was carefully prospected, and about 5 dwt. of
Results op Analysis expressed in Parts per POOO'OOO— continued.




coarse water-worn gold obtained from several shafts sunk at the upper portion.
The lower end of the gully was very rough and stony, and did not yield gold.
Leaving the above locality the party moved to the vicinity of Wombat Creek, at
about twelve miles from Golden Point. The creek and its branches were pros-
pected without success. The sinking was wet, and from 10 to 12 feet in depth.
A hill at the head of the Werribee was tried, and the prospects yielded only a few
fine colors. The head branches of the Werribee and the adjacent gullies were
likewise examined, and were not found to be auriferous.
The party next moved to Mount Wilson, and prospected the surrounding country
and a portion of the Lerderderg River, including its branches, but with no better
result than that of obtaining occasionally a few fine colors of gold. Some quartz
reefs in the vicinity were also prospected, and were not found to contain gold.
After this the party moved to Doctor’s Creek, and prospected some of the adjacent
hills and gullies. In a blind gully a shaft was sunk, which bottomed at 26 feet;
it did not yield gold, but subsequently at the mouth of this gully they obtained a
nugget 14 dwt. in weight, and therefore very thoroughly searched the gully ;
however, no payable ground was found. In the hill side they made a cutting, and
washed a quantity of “stuff,” but only obtained 3 dwt. of gold, and finally
abandoned the place as unremunerative.
On the 30th of June their operations ceased.
Steiglitz Party.
This party consisted of E. W. Lloyd (foreman), J. Reed, J. Burwood, G. Reed,
W. Cook, and T. Herring. They commenced work on the 19th March, at Spring
Gully, in which the depth of sinking varied from 10 to 36 feet, and was rather
wet. No gold was obtained. Along Long Gully many shafts were sunk, and
bottomed at depths ranging from 10 to 38 feet. At one point the gully was
cut across by a drive from an 18-foot to a 23-foot shaft, distant about 27 feet. No
gold, however, was discovered.
In Hut Gully and Gympie Gully prospecting work was done, but without
success.
Towards the close of the month of June the party “ sank a shaft in the cement,
south of Steiglitz,” but did not obtain auriferous washdirt.
The party ceased operations on 30th June.
Smythe’s Creek (Rokewood) Party.
This party consisted of S. Maddison (foreman), W. Dawkins, J. Crockett, J.
Stewart, J. Dial, and O. Jones. They started to work on the 27th February, and
pitched their camp at a spot about one and a half miles north from Bulldog
Diggings, half a mile west from Moonlight Creek, and about three miles east from
Cape Clear. Seven shafts, ranging in depth from 16 to 78 feet, bottomed on
sandstone, with a little wash. From several of them drives were made, in some
instances as far as 20 feet, and in opposite directions, but in no case was any
quantity of gold approaching a payable amount obtained.
The party then moved to a site between Moonlight and Kangaroo, hoping to find
a run of gold lost about seventeen years ago, and known as Happy Jack’s Lead.
With this view four shafts were sunk, and all bottomed on sandstone. The


depth of sinking ranged from 60 to 96 feet, and at each shaft drives were put
in for distances varying from 20 to 43 feet. The party failed to find payable
ground. Altogether the party sank 530 feet, and drove 266 feet.
At the end of June work was discontinued.
Bwninyong Party.
This party consisted of A. W. Chapman (foreman), W. Pengelly, A. Luke,
T. M. Stanley, T. Grills, and C. A. Westh. They began operations on the 29th
January, prospecting, in companies of two, three localities in the vicinity of Bunin-
yong, simultaneously.
At the Union Jack, about half a mile north-east of the Buninyong post office,
twenty holes, varying in depth from 4 to 20 feet, were sunk within an area of
about half a mile. Several quartz veins were discovered. At no place tried
was gold obtained.
At the Devonshire Range, about three miles south-east of Buninyong, within an
area of about two miles, fourteen holes were sunk to depths varying from 8 to
22 feet; here also quartz veins were found, but no gold in either quartz or alluvial.
At the South Durham, six miles south-east of Buninyong, within an area of
about three miles, thirteen shafts were sunk and bottomed at depths ranging from
Bto 23 feet. In only the deepest shaft was gold obtained. From the bottom of it
a few fine colors of gold were got. The prospect was not sufficient to encourage
the party to continue working in this area.
On the termination of these operations the party formed a camp on Monmouth
Flat, north-west of Hardie’s Hill, and about south-west of Buninyong. Here,
within an area of a mile, fifteen holes were bottomed at depths ranging from 4 to
IS feet ; in none was gold obtained. The sinking was “through dark yellow clay
intermixed with cut quartz, without any sign of wash.” The bottom was generally
hard sandstone, but in a few places it consisted “of a soft mullocky ” formation.
In a north-easterly direction, covering an area of one and a half miles, twenty-three
shafts were sunk to similar depths as the foregoing. One of this series of shafts,
that bottomed at a depth of 13 feet, yielded colors of gold ; and three others
bottomed on small quartz veins, none of which yielded gold. The sinking in this
portion of the flat was principally through “ hard yellow clay intermixed with
quartz from surface to bottom.”
South-east of Monmouth a shaft was bottomed at a depth of 17 feet, on soft
sandstone ; neither wash nor gold was found in it. The party left this place and
camped near a range of hills about seven miles south-east of Buninyong. Here
nine holes, from 3 to 9 feet in depth, were sunk through clay intermixed
with quartz and ironstone, and bottoming on hard sandstone; no gold was
obtained. One mile further east, twelve holes, from 3 to 15 feet in depth, were
sunk, eleven of which were non-auriferous ; the twelfth yielded a few fine specks
of gold. In an adjoining gully four holes were sunk, and bottomed on hard sand-
stone, at depths ranging from sto 9 feet; in none of them was gold found. On
the Durham a shaft was sunk “through 5 feet very soft clay and gravel, 7 feet
broken basaltic rock, and 8 feet large quartz boulders, intermixed with a sandy
wash.” The major portion of this shaft had to be timbered, and the influx of
water was considerable. In the wash a few fine colors of gold were obtained.
The shaft had to be abandoned on account of the water gaining too rapidly.


On the Devonshire Range two holes were sunk, which bottomed on quartz veins,
and yielded a few fine colors of gold. Having consulted Mr. Mining Surveyor
Harvey, the foreman decided “to move to the foot of the range and put in a tunnel,
so as to intersect all the veins in the hill.” The whole party engaged in the work.
The tunnel was driven through alternating strata of hard sandstone and slate,
intersected occasionally by veins of quartz, till a distance of about 225 feet had
been driven, when quartz intermixed with slate was struck and pierced to 255 feet,
which was the total length of the tunnel on the 30th of June, the date upon which
the prospecting vote lapsed. The last few feet of country yielded such fair pros-
pects that the party continued to drive the tunnel.
Writing on the 21st of November, Mr. Mining Surveyor Harvey reports :
“The tunnel is situated on allotment No. 131, country lands south of Buninyong
township, and is 77 chains S. of township boundary ; its dimensions are 6 feet
high by an average width of 5 feet 6 inches, arched on top, and no timber except
an opening set used ; it is driven due west, through a hard schistose country of
sandstone and slate, mostly requiring blasting. The total distance driven by the
prospecting party is 239 feet 7 inches, with a few feet of open cutting to entrance
of tunnel, passing through numerous quartz veins and leaders ; a strong body of
quartz, 3 feet thick, occurs at 223 feet, with about 6 feet on each side of quartz
veins mixed with slate casing, from which, the prospecting party informed me,
they washed prospects showing a yield of 3 dwt. to the ton. If such be the case,
the discovery is a valuable one, and this run of quartz should be followed north and
south. The tunnel is surrounded by alluvial gold workings, which have proved
very remunerative ; and in the gully a few chains north from it many specimens
of gold-bearing quartz were found. The nearest quartz workings are those of the
John Bunyan Company, now working the Devonshire Reef, twenty-six and a half
miles north from the line of tunnel. They have a reef 14 feet wide, yielding an
average of 3 dwt. to the ton, with an underlie about W. 87°, and a strike nearly
due north. This would give a total distance of 600 feet from the mouth of tunnel
to the line of the Devonshire Reef ; and, from measurement, I find that the party
now driving the tunnel, ‘ The Devonshire Gold Mining Company,’ have added a
distance of 264 feet through similar country, somewhat harder ; the tunnel is now,
therefore, 503 feet 7 inches in length. The driving is quite dry with a slight rise
upwards, the summit of the range being about 180 feet above level of tunnel.”
Beechwoeth Mining Disteict.
Beechworth (MurmungeeJ Party.
The members of this party were W. Dalgliesh (foreman), C. Grant, J. Adams,
H. Smith, and G. Thompson. They began operations early in February, at
Buckland Gap, on the west side of the road, at the corner of Corbett’s paddock.
The first shaft sunk bottomed at 70 feet, on “ soft open sandstone,” with a few
specks of gold on the bottom. From the shaft drives were put in east and west.
The eastern drive cut through “a hard slaty bar into a red gravel, yielding pros-
pects of two or three specks to the dish.” When in 20 feet this drive was
abandoned on account of hard rock being encountered. The west drive became
dangerous to work, through influx of water, and was discontinued after 37 feet had
been driven. No payable amount of gold was obtained in either drive. A second
2 c


shaft was sunk further west than the end of the west drive mentioned above, and
bottomed at 55 feet “on a rotten slaty formation no gold was obtained. About
30 feet still further west a third shaft was sunk, and “ bottomed on a high reef,”
says the foreman, “ with a prospect of only a color, at a depth of 40 feet and he
felt satisfied that no payable lead of gold came down the gully on the west side of
the road.
On the east side of the road the fourth shaft was sunk, in the hope of finding the
run of gold that was traced some years ago to the falls at Buckland Gap. This
shaft bottomed at 80 feet on a fine soft slate bottom with about 2 feet of gravel
overlying it, which yielded prospects of about one grain of gold to a dish of wash.
On the west side of the shaft the party put in a drive. At 16 feet a hard slate reef
was struck, and the drive was continued in a southerly direction, “ yielding occa-
sional prospects of from a single speck up to half a pennyweight of very coarse gold
to the dish.” The washdirt was about 18 inches thick, and the bottom “where
best prospects were obtained, a jointy slate; at other times it was a soft close clay,
yielding very small prospects.” At 24 feet the slate formation entirely disappeared,
and the prospects fell off; however, the party persevered, and after driving a
further distance of 6 feet drove at right angles to the east, and continued driving
in that direction till ground 50 feet in width had been proved. This easterly
portion of the drive exposed another lead on the east side of the shaft, about 6 feet
in width, thus showing that in the locality there were three different runs all trend-
ing in the same direction and towards the same point, but which, worked separately,
would not be payable. With the view of striking upon the lead resulting from a
junction of the three runs, a shaft 80 yards away from the foregoing, in the sup-
posed direction of the lead, was sunk, and bottomed at 87 feet on a reef dipping
sharply off to the east, and without showing the color of gold. The sinking in the
shaft was very hard. A drive was put in eastward, which gave varying success,
“ sometimes fair prospects —oftener very poor.” At 95 feet a run of “ fine red wash,
varying from 2 to 3 feet in depth, was struck, two loads of which, upon being
washed, yielded 2 dwt. 2 gr. per load of thirty-six buckets.
The end of the financial year occurring at this juncture the party’s connection
with the Government had to terminate, and the party pegged off a claim and con-
tinued to work on their own account. For a few weeks they had fair success,
which induced some other parties to take up claims near; but the discovery of a
payable goldfield has not yet resulted from their combined labors.
Alexandra Party.
The members of this party were E. Day (foreman), J. E. Trezise, J. Scott,
J. Prime, and A. Milroy. They started on the 15th of May, and travelling by way
of the Rubicon River arrived on the evening of the 16th at the junction of the two
branches of that stream. The country traversed was very rough and scrubby.
From this camping place an exploration was made to and over the middle spur,
about two miles south. The geological formation is granitic, and the timber prin-
cipally peppermint intermixed with blue gum. They then pursued their course in
a S.S.E. direction, crossing about one mile of table-land with a deep soil of granitic
origin, well impregnated with decayed vegetable matter and bearing messmate. On
this table-land they erected a cairn. Continuing their course for some miles further,
the party traversed ground of a similar formation, and bearing the same timber.


with the addition at one point of splendid mountain ash, over 170 feet in height.
They then turned due east and struck the left-hand branch of the Rubicon, which
they followed till the camp was regained. In a distance of about live miles they
crossed and re-crossed the river twenty times. Starting from the cairn referred to
above, the left-hand branch of the river was prospected for several miles, when some
falls were encountered, and the course being very rocky and without promise of
gold, the party returned to the camping place. No gold was found on the Rubicon
River nor its branches.
The party explored next south-westerly to Mount Arnold. At the heads of the
right-hand branch of the Rubicon River they found splendid myrtle and sassafras,
also fern trees and tea-tree scrub, and a belt about four and a half miles wide of
very fine mountain ash. The party prospected without success onward till Mount
Arnold was reached and crossed, when they turned westward to the head of the
Taggarty River, and followed it down for about nine miles. They crossed the river
many times, and tried several places along its course, but did not succeed in obtain-
ing gold. The last three miles of the banks of the Taggarty proved to be of sand-
stone formation ; the whole of the preceding course was granitic. Leaving the
Taggarty River, the party made for their camp across country, a distance of about
twenty-eight miles, which was densely scrubby with sword and wire grass 12 feet
high.
In accordance with instructions, the party moved to Connelly’s Creek, and
examined the country within a radius of four miles from their camp. They found
quartz upon several of the spurs, but did not obtain gold from any of the spots they
tried. The right-hand branch of the creek and its tributaries, together with the
principal gullies, were carefully searched for the precious metal, but nothing more
than occasional fine colors of gold to the dish were obtained. The shafts sunk in
the gullies varied in depth, in some places reaching beyond a depth of 50 feet, and
bottomed on sandstone.
On the tributaries of the Niagaroon Creek the country was also deep, and the
influx of water so large that the party were compelled to abandon several shafts
before reaching bottom. A very little gold was found in this locality, but nothing
approaching or giving hope of the existence of a payable field. The party were
disbanded on the 30th of June.
Sandhurst Mining District.
Reedy Creek Party.
The members of this party were E. W. Gladman (foreman), J. Farrell, J. Cole,
W. Baird, and J. McFie. They commenced work on the 20th of March, at Strath
Creek, north-west of the Engineer Spur. Three shafts were sunk ; one on the
north side of the spur, yielded a few rough specks of gold. On the same side and
more to the north than the foregoing a shaft was sunk to a depth of 22 feet
through shingle, and had to be abandoned before bottom was reached, it being
unsafe to work it deeper on account of the loose nature of the ground. On the
south side of the spur a shaft bottomed on hard slate at a depth of 15 feet, and
yielded a prospect of about three grains of gold.
The party moved to the Bee-tree Gully, distant about six miles south-east;
several shafts were sunk in the neighborhood. One, which bottomed on hard slate.


yielded 10 grs. of water-worn gold. A drive was put in from this shaft, but the
prospects were not sustained, and the party moved to about five miles south-south-
west, and prospected Silver and Wallaby creeks. At these creeks the sinking was
very shallow, from 3 to 5 feet, and bottomed in some places on decomposed granite,
at other places on sandstone. Only a few fine colors of gold were obtained. The
party likewise prospected a portion of the King Parrot Creek, and the foreman
reported :—“Fine gold, nearly payable, can he obtained in the loose drift and wash
upon the banks of the creek ; the flats have not been tried.” On the flats the
country was deep and could not be prospected by the party.
The tributaries of Strath Creek were prospected, but without favorable result;
the sinking along their course is shallow, not more than 7 feet in depth. At
Breakneck Gully and Cannon Creek shafts were sunk, bottoming on sandstone ;
only fine colors of gold were obtained. Diggers’ Gully was also prospected. The
various shafts sunk in it bottomed on hard slate, and yielded no better results than
the party had obtained at other places.
The party experienced much inconvenience from heavy rain about the middle of
May, and two of the party deserted. At the end of May the party ceased work.
Heaihcote Party.
This party consisted of D. O’Rourke (foreman), H. J. Bellchambers, G. T.
Darvill, H. Field, and J. Brown. They started on the 25th April, crossed the
Dividing Range, and proceeded as far as Dairy Creek, near to which they pitched
their tents and began operations. An exploration of the country for several miles
round the camp showed there was a great scarcity of water. Commencing well up
the creek, the party sank four shafts, and bottomed at a depth of about 14 feet.
Two of the shafts bottomed on sandstone underlying “hard clay with layers of
gravel and large sandstone boulders near the bottom.” The others “ bottomed on
soft slate,” underlying “ hard sand mixed with gravel and thin layers of shingle.”
Colors of gold were obtained at each shaft. Moving in the direction of the stream
northward four more shafts were sunk, and bottomed on sandstone at depths vary-
ing from 15 to 17 feet. One yielded a little gold, and a drive was put in from it
for a distance of 12 feet, but no more gold was obtained.
At Mountain Creek holes were sunk ranging in depth from 6 to 9 feet, and
bottoming on soft slate ; at all, colors of gold were found. Some prospecting was
also done at the head of this creek, and the foreman thus reported concerning the
formation: —“ First 6 feet loamy clay, rather soft, easy to sink, the remainder to a
depth of 18 feet was a very hard gravel with thin layers of quartz pebble ; bottom,
a hard slate.” A few specks of gold were found, and from one shaft a drive was
put in a distance of 7 feet, but the prospects did not improve.
Speaking generally of the character of the strata on the western side of the
Dividing Range, the foreman says :—“ There is a great similarity in the sinking ;it
is either a hard clay mixed with layers of gravel, or an equally hard sand with
very thin layers of shingle, with boulders in almost every hole within a few feet of
the bottom.”
The party crossed to the east side of the range and sank altogether eighteen
shafts, ranging in depth from 4 to 32 feet. Some yielded colors of gold. The
deepest sinking passed through “ alternate layers of clay, sand, and gravel; and,


as it neared the bottom, it was mixed with floating reef or pipe-clay, with pipe-clay
bottom.” As a few specks of gold were obtained at this shaft, a drive was put in
for a distance of 12 feet, but the prospects did not improve. Cuttings also were
made across the most promising flat; the depth was from 4to 5 feet, with pipe-
clay bottom. No payable amount of gold was obtained.
Respecting the operations of the party, the foreman in his final report says: —“ In
conclusion, I beg leave to remark that in almost every flat and gully there is more
or less gold, but nothing that will pay. Should there be at any future time any
discoveries of gold made (in this locality), I am perfectly satisfied it will be nothing
more than a patch ; I believe there will be nothing continuous.”
The party ceased operations on the 25th June.
Homebush (Axe Creek) Party.
This party consisted of R. Parker (foreman), P. Lynch, W. H. Parker, W.
Gillett, and M. Guerin, and began early in April to prospect eastward from south
of the Homebush estate. They thoroughly examined the ground east from the
late Homebush rush, as far as Axe Creek. A great many holes and shafts were
sunk in the low-lying ground, as also upon the cement hills north and south. The
sinking ranged from 3 to 27 feet; and, as a rule, the ground was very hard and
required blasting. The bottom was generally sandstone, with slate or “ pipe-clay,”
At nearly every shaft gold was obtained, but only in a few sufficient to give hope
of success attending eventually the party’s labors. The cement hills, in which
shafts with drives were put, yielded a few fair prospects ; but upon a considerable
quantity of the “ stuff” at such places being washed the prospects obtained by the
dish were not maintained, and in spite of the well directed efforts of the party
ground that yielded payable results was not discovered.
The operations of the party were discontinued at the end of June.
Rushworth Party.
The members of this party were S. Ryan (foreman), J. Hannah, C. Mousley,
W. Jackson, H. Robertshaw, D. O’Sullivan, and W. Cameron. They began work
on the 30th of April, at a site about two and a half miles east of Rushworth. Their
efforts were entirely devoted to prospecting the ground in a line north and south
from the Old Lead. The first shaft was sunk at a point about 236 feet north of the
main road, and subsequently shafts to the number of eleven were sunk to within a
distance of about 40 feet from the old workings. On the same line, but north of
the old workings, and between the road to Gunn’s Station and adjacent creek, two
shafts were sunk, and also one about 600 yards to the eastward of them. The
“ bottom ” of all the shafts was “ pipe-clay,” and the superincumbent strata clay,
clay and gravel mixed, cemented gravel, and gravel. The driving was difficult
owing to the presence of “ironstone bars” and hard cement.
At the southern end of the line of shafts the ground was between 5 and 6 feet in
depth, and it gradually deepened till at the most northerly shaft bottom was not
touched before 48 feet of sinking had been done. The distances between the shafts
differed, but on the average the shafts were 90 feet apart. At only two places in
the line of shafts was appreciably auriferous ground found, viz., at a drive made
from shaft No. 9 to shaft No. 10, and at a shaft sunk between Nos. 8 and 9 shafts.


At the drive three and a half bucketsful of wash obtained at one spot yielded a
pennyweight of fine gold. At the shaft which bottomed at 31 feet one bucketful
of dirt off the bottom yielded 1J gr. of gold. However, up to the 30th of June,
the party did not discover a payable run of gold. During the time the party was
at work they did about 350 feet of sinking and 50 feet of driving.
Government aid was withdrawn from the party at the end of the financial year,
hut they continued to work, and with a gradually increasing measure of success.
Eventually they struck payable ground. A “rush” ensued, and by the 10th of
October it was estimated there were 700 persons on the spot. One hundred holes
had been bottomed, and there were fourteen holes then actually on gold. These
claims were doing very well. In the previous week from eight of them 52 loads of
dirt were washed and crushed, with a yield of 85 oz. of gold,
Maryborough Mining District.
Amherst Party.
This party consisted of R. D. Burrall (foreman), B. Byrnes, R. McFarlane, J.
McKinstray, and 0. Anderson. They took the field on the 15th March, and formed
their camp east of the Bet Bet Creek, near the Government Reserve, south of
Glenmona station. For some time water was very scarce in the district, and the
efforts of the party were confined at first to the most suitable spots for prospecting,
immediately north and south of the road from Lamplough and on the west side of
the range between Amherst and the Bet Bet Creek. Fourteen shafts were sunk in
gullies north of the road, ranging in depth from 4 to 13 feet, but without success.
On a large flat trending toward the creek and south of the road five shafts were
sunk and bottomed, at depths varying from 10 to 23 feet. A small amount of
gold was obtained, very fine and widely scattered. At two shafts drives were put
in a total distance of 19 feet, as there was fair shingle-wash. From these drives no
improved prospects were obtained. Shafts were also sunk in some tributary gullies
of the flat, but did not yield auriferous wash.
Satisfied that he had fairly tried the available shallow ground on the west side,
the foreman next prospected that on the eastern side of the road, and sank north
and south of the road shafts to the number of seventeen, which ranged in depth
from 4to 15 feet. At three of these shafts drives were put in, the shortest being
15 feet, and the longest 30 feet. The party washed three loads of washdirt, and
obtained therefrom 4| dwt. of gold. They sank shafts along the probable course
of the deepest ground, testing the run for a distance of 200 feet, but did not
succeed in striking payable ground.
They also prospected many spots in going northward as far as the junction of the
Maryborough and Avoca roads, but at no place was any payable ground discovered,
though many of the shafts yielded small quantities of gold. Next they prospected
a flat north of the Avoca road by sinking a line of five shafts. From the deepest
of these, which bottomed at 23 feet, they obtained a prospect of 12 grs. from a tub
of dirt. This yield induced the prospectors to drive for several feet in opposite
directions, but although they tried several tubs of stuff they did not obtain again
anything approaching to the first prospect.


Leaving this locality, the party further prospected the ground east of the
range and north of the Amherst road, and continued to work here for several weeks
after Government aid had been withdrawn. From three loads of dirt at one shaft
they obtained 13f dwt. of gold, and registered a claim, in consequence of which a
small rush took place. The prospecting party took out a block 30 feet by 15
feet, and obtained dwt. to the load.
Fifty shafts were sunk; and many that the prospectors had previously sunk were
driven in various directions, by miners, but in no case was richer ground found than
that registered by the prospecting party. The foreman, writing on the 31st July,
says :—“ Several of the claims as well as our own would have been wrought if water
had been obtainable on the spot, but as the expense of carting to the creek is too
great to make it pay the locality is for the present deserted.”
Avoca Party.
The members of this party were C. Hall (foreman), J. C. Dowall, J. Wright,
P. Donoghue, and W. J. Simmons. On the Bth of May they commenced opera-
tions at the head of Wattle Flat, west of No. 1 Creek. The first shaft they sank
bottomed at a depth of 9 feet, the sinking being through “ hard-baked sand, and
unwashed quartz.” No indications of gold were obtained. Another, near to the
first, bottomed at 14 feet, the sinking here being through hard gravel, and for the
last 3 feet heavy wash of quartz boulders and slate.” OS the bottom a few colors
of gold were obtained. Three other shafts sunk in this gully yielded no better
results than the above-mentioned.
The prospectors moved southward to Separation Flat. In the centre of it they sank
two shafts, one of which bottomed “on the blow of a quartz reef,” and a few fine
colors of gold were obtained oS the bottom. The other shaft, after piercing through
“hard slaty shingle, and unwashed quartz, at 14 feet in depth bottomed on ‘pipe-
clay.’” From the wash several colors of gold of a “ snufiy shade” were obtained,
and in one dish as much as half a grain of gold was procured. The party therefore
sank shafts in a line with and on each side of the above, so as to “ thoroughly test
the ground and prove whether any break in the reef existed, and thus afford room
for a narrow lead.” Nothing however more encouraging than “ a quantity of fine
colors ” of the precious metal could be obtained.
These operations having cut this portion of the flat across, and no payable results
appearing, the party prospected the flat as low down as practicable, so as to cut if
possible the lost Mountain Hut Lead. At a depth of 17 feet bottom was reached,
on which rested a “ fine wash of heavy boulders and ironstone ;” no gold was
obtained. A shaft sunk at about half a mile distant bottomed at 18 feet with a
heavy wash, which also was non-auriferous. On the north side of the flat, and in
a line with the foregoing shafts, one was sunk which cut through sand and gravel,
and bottomed at a depth of 19 feet. From the bottom a few fine colors of gold
were obtained. On the northern side of an adjacent cement hill, four shafts were
sunk, but only a few fine colors of gold were procured.
Having cut the country from Mountain Hut to Wattle Flat, a distance of one
and a half miles, the foreman concluded that “the entire ground prospected is
useless to the miner,” and he moved the party to the north fork of No. 1 Creek,
about a mile above the old workings, and above the paddocks in the hands of


selectors. On a hill between the two creeks that form the southern fork a shaft
was sunk to a depth of 60 feet, through —
1. Close gravel with cement. 7. Gravel and slate.
2. Cemented quartz, mixed with clay. 8. Concrete clay and gravel.
3. Alternate layers of quartz and shingle. 9. Hard gravel and slate.
4. Sand. 10. Cemented gravel, with large boulders,
5. Concrete of clay or stiff pug. such as is generally found to overlie
6. Layers of gravel and pug. floating reef or bottom.
The sinking for the last 3 feet was through a heavy wash of sandstone and
quartz boulders, with floating reef. At 2 feet from the bottom the wash yielded
a dozen colors of fine gold to the dish ; no gold was obtained off the bottom. A
drive was put in, but the prospects did not improve.
On a hill between the two creeks forming the north fork of the creek a shaft
was sunk that pierced much the same description of strata as the foregoing. It
bottomed at a depth of 26 feet, and about a dozen colors of gold were got therefrom.
There was no inducement to put in a drive from this shaft, so about 400 yards
higher up another was begun, but at 7 feet deep the party “ struck heavy water in
drift.” As there was an under-current running that would have required pumping
gear to control it, the shaft was abandoned and another sunk midway between the
site of it and the preceding. At a depth of 21 feet the bottom was reached, upon
which rested a slate and gravel-wash ; it did not contain gold.
From two shafts sunk in the hill on which the camp stood nothing encouraging
was obtained.
At the termination of the financial year the party ceased work.
Inglewood Party.
The members of this party were J. B. McLintock (foreman), T. Barnett, F. W.
Coumbe, P. Cotter, and J. McKerdy. They started on the 3rd of February and
pitched their first camp at Ferriby Creek, about one mile from Brenanah home-
stead. The gullies in the vicinity were prospected. The depth of sinking was
from 3to 11 feet, and the formation granite, slate, and sandstone. Not even the
color of gold was raised in any of the prospects. Several quartz reefs were seen,
and writing about them the foreman says, “ they were all alike—a raw white stone,
having no appearance of being gold-bearing.” The party crossed over to the
westerly fall of the range to about three miles west of Brenanah, and prospected
Back Creek, Kooyoora Creek, and the gullies in the vicinity of the latter. The
geological formation is similar to that on the east side, and the depth of ground from
sto 25 feet. No gold was obtained. The quartz reefs in the locality were
also examined, but none proved auriferous. Leaving this neighborhood, the party
crossed to Brenanah Creek and prospected on the made hills due east from Mount
Brenanah. On a large flat, three-quarters of a mile from the foot of the mount,
about nine years ago, a Government prospecting party sank three shafts, 60 feet
apart. In order that this flat should be thoroughly prospected across from
ridge to ridge, the prospectors tailed on to the line of old shafts, and sank shafts
bottoming at from 35 to 52 feet in depth ; no gold was obtained. The foreman
reported :—“ There are two distinct formations of ground in this neighborhood ; the
surface formation, of a depth of 7 feet, is a red heavy wash of ironstone and quartz,
similar to the shallow gully sinking on Kingower and Berlin, while the other
45 feet are a white wash, commencing with a white sandy clay—a sort of false


bottom for the red wash —and from that layers of drift sand and gravel alternately
till within 4 feet of the bottom, when a heavy quartz wash sets in with floating
sandstone boulders and pipe-clay on to a fine soft granite bottom, white and
yellow.”
A gully near (“ at the head of which is the source of Sunday Morning Reef ”)
was also prospected. Two shafts bottomed at 32 feet; no gold was obtained. In
an adjacent gully several shafts were sunk and bottomed on sandstone. In one
a few colors of gold were obtained.
Leaving the above neighborhood, the party moved to the north end of the range,
and completed prospecting the same to within five miles of Wedderburn. The
shafts put down varied from 5 to 20 feet in depth, and bottomed on sandstone.
They did not prove auriferous. The foreman remarks :—“ The two principal breaks
of the range were a failure. It was only at the extreme end of the Brenanah
Range we obtained the colors of gold, and that in shallow gullies with a heavy iron-
stone wash on a decomposed sandstone bottom. In the deeper shafts, with a granite
wash and soft granite bottom, we never found the finest color of gold, or black sand.
The made hills continue to the end of the range, and I do not consider them
gold-bearing.”
The party next camped at Kooyoora Springs, and prospected the easterly fall of
Kingower. They sank many shafts, varying in depth from 6 to 15 feet, but did
not obtain any payable prospects. They also began to prospect the deep ground on
the course of the Kingower line of reefs. A shaft was sunk and bottomed, at a
depth of 104 feet, on a soft granite bottom ; it was perfectly dry. The strata
passed through consisted of “ layers of sand of different colors, fine gravel, white
stiff clay, and seams of dark cement, some of them very hard, the last seam being
on the bottom wash.” There were nearly 3 feet of wash of good appearance, but it
yielded only a fine color of gold to the dish.
Drives were put in east and west to a total distance of 40 feet; but the prospects
had not improved when the party ceased work on the 30th June.
Wedderburn Party.
This party consisted of J. O. Shaw (foreman), J. G. Cosh, W. Gilfillan, R. Owen,
A. Scraboyna, and T. Murphy. On the 26th March they began by prospecting the
gullies situated about four and a half miles south-west of the township of Wedder-
burn. Eight gullies were thoroughly prospected, sixty-four holes being sunk,
varying in depth from 4to 13 feet. In twenty-three of them colors of gold were
obtained, but in no case did a prospect approach to a payable amount.
Leaving these gullies the prospectors moved to Kerang Flat, about five miles north-
west of the township. They sank in the locality fifty-four holes varying in depth
from 4to 14 feet, and generally bottomed on slaty formation. Occasionally fine
colors of gold were obtained, but no prospects of an encouraging character resulted
from their labors at any portion of the flat.
The party next prospected the country for a distance of about eight miles, along
the road from Wedderburn to Inglewood. As a rule in this ground hard cement
was encountered at 4 feet from the surface. Many shafts were sunk and extensive
trenching work done. Several leaders were intersected at various places, but in
except a few instances, where fine colors were obtained, no gold was discovered.
The party ceased work on the 30th June.
2 D


Charlotte Plains Party,
This party consisted of E. H. Cheney (foreman), J. T. Irvine, M. Bowen,
J. Tait, and W. McLaren. They began work on the 23rd February, on the
eastern side of the range running between Havelock and Deep Creek. For about
five miles north and south of Havelock, on this side of the range, as much of the
country as was open to the prospectors was tried by them. The sinking for
the most part was shallow; but in two shafts depths of 40 and 42 feet were
sunk before bottom was reached. The sinking was hard and the bottom devoid of
washdirt. No gold was discovered.
The party moved to Four-mile Creek, near to which, and three miles north of
Havelock, their camp was made. On a flat near the Oxonian Reef fourteen holes
were bottomed at depths of from 3J to 9 feet, and in none was there wash or gold.
Two shafts in deep ground were sunk to a depth of 60 feet, and then, on account
of water, had to be abandoned. More to the south, on the same flat, thirteen holes
were sunk ; ten were shallow, about 4 feet in depth; one bottomed at 26 feet; and
two at 58 feet. All the deep sinking was hard, and in every case the bottom was
“ a dry hungry cemented sand ” without washdirt or gravel, and non-auriferous.
An adjacent gully was prospected without result, also a flat running north and
south, situated north-west of Havelock.
The party next moved to one mile west of Havelock, so that they might prospect
the country between that place and Chinaman’s Flat. The ground proved to be
from 42 to 43 feet in depth and but slightly auriferous.
At the request of the Crown Lands Department the party was directed to prospect
a certain area adjoining H. Oldsen’s land, parish of Bet Bet. About twenty-four
holes were sunk, in most places through very hard cemented gravel. The depths
varied from 3 to 50 feet, and there was wash in two, and only the color of gold
in one of them. The party cut also trenches or cuttings at certain places to
prospect for reefs.
After this the party again went to the west of Havelock, and at about two and a
half miles therefrom prospected a flat. At the head of it the ground proved from
4to 14 feet in depth, and here the color of gold only was obtained. Lower down
and on the west side the ground was found to be 48 feet in depth, with a fair but
hard wash on the bottom. Fine colors of gold were obtained and the prospectors put
in a drive from the shaft they sank, and raised about a load of washdirt which yielded
1| dwt. of gold. Subsequently drives were made in four directions, but only the
color of gold could be got in the washdirt taken from them. The foreman con-
sidered he bottomed in a “ crab-hole.” In a flat south of the foregoing a shaft was
bottomed at 32 feet deep, with a dip northward 22° towards the above-mentioned.
A drive in that direction was made, but not even the color of gold was obtained.
Time did not admit of further work.
Orville Party,
Consisted of W. Williams (foreman), A. Mather, A. E. Treble, D. Davies, and
W. H. Donald. They commenced operations on the 30th April, at a spot a little
south of the Kangderaar Creek, between R. Allen’s holding and the road from Wehla
to Tarnagulla. They sank three shafts and bottomed at about 7 feet. The sink-
ing was through “a dark-colored cement,” with very little wash and no gold.


They then tried a flat south of and bordering the creek by sinking two shafts. One
bottomed at 11 feet on “ soft granite,” above which was clay sand and light gravel.
The other shaft bottomed at a depth of 20 feet, also on soft granite, underlying
similar strata. No gold was obtained from either. Having further prospected the
locality by trying the surface for some distance around and discovering no gold, the
party moved to Murphy’s Creek, near Mrs. Bell’s selection, and examined the ranges
in the neighborhood. The party cleaned out an old shaft sunk through cement
with a light wash resting on a soft granite bottom. From it drives were put in 21
feet east and 13 feet west ; not even the color of gold was obtained. Two other
shafts were sunk in the vicinity of the foregoing, one bottomed at 29 feet, the other
at 12 feet on granite. At the deeper of the two a drive was put in for a distance of
20 feet. From neither was gold obtained. The prospectors then moved to near Mr.
Miller’s selection, situated between Murphy’s Creek and the Dunolly Reservoir,
with the view of prospecting the made hills in that locality. Nine shafts were
sunk and bottomed at depths ranging from 6 to 14 feet. From the bottom of
one about 20 grs. of gold were obtained; but, although the ground was carefully
prospected all round, only a few colors to the dish could be secured ; the wash ran
out and the reef rose on all sides of the shaft. At some of the other shafts colors
of gold were obtained, but nothing payable, although in a few cases good promising
wash was discovered.
The sinking generally was through a light-colored cement on to a granite bottom.
The party disbanded on 30th June.
Maryborough Party .
This party consisted of A. Murray (foreman), J. Kessack, T. McPhail, A.
McDonald, and T. Murray.
They left Maryborough on 21st February and proceeded to Smoky Creek, west
of Archdale Bridge, via Bet Bet. The country eastward toward Emu was
explored, and the color of gold was obtained at the surface on a hill near Mr.
Chirnside’s property. Systematic prospecting was commenced by sinking across a
gully at the most eastern point of the unalienated land in this locality. The
depths of the shafts ranged from 10 to 22 feet, and they bottomed on “ soft
pipe-clay.” Only fine colors of gold were obtained. The flats and cement hills
about a mile to the westward were prospected. The ground proved shallow, 2
to 9 feet in depth ; and at several places a fair amount of wash was struck, but in
no instance was a yield of more than a few specks of gold obtained. The party
crossed over to the western slope, and prospected upward from the west, but the
prospects were poor, and gave no reason to suppose any payable gold country would
be found in the locality on this side of the range. Therefore the party moved their
camp to near the old road from Dalyenong, which intersects the Avoca and Stuart
Mill road, near Yoss’ holding, about half a mile south of Dalyenong, A large flat
(locally known as Mountain Creek Flat, running northward and lying east of the
Mount Hawkin Ranges) contains several lines of old drift hills with granite bottom
and “ surrounded by slate ranges full of quartz veins.” The cement hills yielded
only very fine gold, nothing payable. In the flat land no better prospects were
obtained. A gully and the western branch of the flat were also tried, and the
prospects yielding coarser gold, the prospectors were sanguine for a time of meeting
with success in the locality. Sinking was carried on across the west branch of the


flat, but no gutter was found ; and “ the wash all across was poor and barren
looking.” The camp was moved to the head of the gullies trending into the
eastern branch. These gullies, with the intervening cement hills, were prospected,
but the efforts of the party to find payable gold were not rewarded with success.
The party returned to Maryborough* on the 23rd June.
St. Arnaud Party.
This party, consisting of G. W. Gillies (foreman), A. Reid, C. Smitheram, H.
Bell, and W. Smith, left St. Arnaud on the 9th of May and proceeded to prospect
the country within a few miles’ radius of their camp, which they placed at about
six miles north from St. Arnaud. In a gully near the camp three shafts were sunk
to the respective depths of 8 feet, 10 feet, and 12 feet. The sinking was very
hard, and the bottom rock yellow sandstone. In the deepest shaft a few colors to
the dish were obtained ; the party therefore put in a drive for a distance of 12 feet,
but failed to secure better yields. In a gully half a mile or so west from the camp
four shafts were sunk. The sinking was easy and the bottom “ a mullocky pipe-
clay.” The depth of these shafts ranged from 10 to 16 feet, but in none was
gold obtained. In the 16 feet shaft a quartz reef, 2 feet in thickness, w r as struck,
hut no gold could be obtained from it.
One and a half miles east of the camp, at a promising looking gully, with a fine
flat running north and south for about three miles, the hills on each side of which
were covered with quartz anff sandstone, six shafts were sunk. The bottom was
struck at depths ranging from 12 to 24 feet. In only one was the color of gold
obtained. Four bottomed on “soft pipe-clay,” the other two on sandstone. On a
hill about one mile west from the camp two shallow holes were dug, but no indica-
tions of gold were obtained.
Two gullies about one mile east from the camp were also prospected. In one
two holes, 8 and 11 feet deep, bottomed on slate and did not yield gold. In the
other gully three shafts, 11 feet, 33 feet, and 28 feet deep respectively, were sunk
and bottomed. The two deepest shafts yielded colors of gold to a bucketful of
washdirt, but the prospects did not improve.
The party moved to a spot about six miles east by south from St. Arnaud
close to the Inglewood road, and at the St. Arnaud corner of Hackett’s farm.
From this camp they prospected three cement hills and a flat about one mile in
length. Eleven shafts were sunk and varied in depth, on the hills from
8 to 42 feet, and on the flat from 11 to 16 feet. From the deep shaft on
the hill a drive was put in a distance of 26 feet ; the gold obtained was not a
payable amount. At one shaft bottomed at 10 feet, on one of the hills, prospects
were obtained of 2 dwt. to the load of “ stuff.” This was the highest result secured.
The party was disbanded at the end of June. During the time the prospectors
were in the field they did about 450 feet of sinking, for the most part through hard
cement, and upwards of 50 feet of driving.
Castlemaine Mining District.
Daylesford Party.
Consisted of J. Hill (foreman), A. Watt, J. L. Hocking, J. H. Thomas, and
H. Couch, and got to work the last week in .March. They camped half a mile


south of the head of Wombat Creek, and three-fourths of a mile from the head of
the Werribee Creek. At the head of Eeedy Creek many holes were sunk and
bottomed at depths varying from 5 to 11 feet, with little or no wash and no
gold. The formation is sandstone with quartz intermixed. Several trenches were
dug and many quartz leaders cut, none of which turned out permanent lodes
nor contained gold. The country around the head of Eeedy Creek did not prove
auriferous. Wombat Creek was prospected for a few miles down from the Dividing
Eange, hut without success ; also Stony Creek, where the depth of ground was from
4 to 16 feet, with a wash, composed of sandstone and quartz, that yielded only
colors of gold at the deepest shafts. The western tributaries of Stony Creek
were also prospected thoroughly. The ground was comparatively shallow, 3-|
to 12 feet in depth, and contained little wash and no gold. On a tributary of the
Werribee Creek, one speck of gold was obtained at one of the shafts. The party
dug trenches for quartz on a spur between Wombat and Cockatoo creeks, and cut
several leaders, which, however, died out at a depth of 5 feet; none of them
yielded gold. While prospecting at the eastern tributaries of the Werribee, at a
hill about one mile south-west of Bullarto, the party encountered “ a strong wash of
quartz boulders with a little fine gold throughout, which,” in the opinion of the
foreman, “if not on such high ground and away from water might pay to work by
sluicing.” On this hill the party did much prospecting, hoping to find a channel of
deep ground, but in this failed. They sank across a flat near the Werribee in this
locality and obtained a few fine colors of gold. They also tried several quartz reefs,
but in none found gold.
From their operations the prospectors were satisfied that the area explored by
them contains no alluvial gold deposit, but consider that possibly some of the reefs
may prove auriferous if worked to a sufficient depth.
At the end of June the party ceased work.
SteeTs Creek Party.
The members of this party were C. B. Spearing (foreman), W. Hunt, S. Clements,
and T. Hamilton.
At the beginning of March the party started and made direct for Muddy Creek,
with the intention of prospecting it and its branches up to the sources. Owing,
however, to the scrubby nature of the country and the want of horse feed, the pros-
pectors found it expedient to reeross the Dividing Eange and prospect Steel’s Creek.
This they did, but were not favored by any material success.
The Muddy Creek was next prospected, and about \ dwt. of gold was obtained,
but not even the color was found in the creeks running into it. The foreman
pushed on to the head of the creek, and found the ranges in the locality steep and
carrying more quartz than lower down. The wash in the creek is full of quartz
and granite boulders.
The party next proceeded to Dry and Wilson’s creeks and the gullies running
into them. Thirty-six holes were sunk in the alluvial without yielding in the
aggregate 1 dwt. of gold. Some likely-looking quartz lodes were discovered to the
west and north-west of Dry Creek, but the foreman did not think it advisable to
spend more time over these than was necessary to assure himself that they did not
contain gold in the surface stone, especially as the country was composed principally
of hard blue slate, and the party did not carry blasting or other reefing tools.


The alluvial ground near Reed’s Creek was tested, but the party were unsuc-
cessful in tracing anything like payable ground, although a few colors of gold were
obtained. A considerable amount of trenching on quartz reefs was done in the
locality without meeting with any encouragement. The camp was therefore moved
back to Muddy Creek, and shafts were sunk in the supposed run of the creek.
Owing to the wet nature of the ground, it was impossible to bottom many of the
shafts. The color of gold was obtained in almost every instance where a shaft was
bottomed, and the general indications point to the presence of gold. The country at
the upper portion of the creek is so scrubby that it was found impossible to make
use of pack horses until a track had been cleared.
Although the efforts of the party to find alluvial gold in payable quantities in the
vicinity of Steel’s, Wilson’s, and Reed’s creeks were unsuccessful, the foreman is
of opinion that there are numerous gold-hearing quartz reefs that only require the
outlay of capital and labor to prove ultimately remunerative.
Hoddle's Creek Party.
The members of this party were T. Ewart (foreman), J. Crimp, T. Wildman,
and A. Burr. They began work on the 10th of April, in a gully at Sheepstation
Creek. Various holes were sunk to an average depth of 11 feet, and the adjacent
creeks were thoroughly prospected, the only result being the color of gold.
The Cockatoo Creek at its junction with Shepherd’s Creek was next tried;
shafts were sunk to depths varying from 7to 18 feet, and nothing better than colors
of gold was obtained. Also the country on the east side of Cockatoo Creek towards
the Macclesfield Diggings was tried, hut no payable ground was discovered. At
one shaft sunk through “rotten basalt” to a depth of 30 feet some ,“strong
colors ” of gold were obtained.
The party also prospected McCrea’s and Hanson’s creeks without finding more
than colors of gold. On Hanson’s Creek granite bottom was struck.
Then the prospectors crossed the range and camped on Hoddle’s Creek, at about
nine miles above the old workings. The several shafts sunk by them in the vicinity
tested both shallow and fairly deep ground, being from 3 feet to 42 feet in depth.
The result was the color of gold only. The party then moved lower down to
within three miles of the old workings, and sank shafts from 19 to 40 feet in depth
without obtaining so much as a color of gold.
At Tea-tree Gully two shafts were sunk to depths of 30 and 32 feet respectively,
but the ground did not prove auriferous.
The party next tried their fortune at Doolan’s Flat and adjoining gullies. The
ground on the flat proved to be from 26 to 45 feet in depth and contained a well-
defined gutter. Two shafts cut through 30 feet of wash, from which colors
of gold could he obtained throughout, but no portion yielded payable prospects.
The sinking was very wet, and the party had to work night and day to keep the
water down.
The ground prospected by this party is a belt of country between the Emerald
Diggings and Yankee Jim’s Creek. The surface is poor and scrubby, very similar
in appearance to that in the neighborhood of the Ringwood mines. The hills have
plenty of quartz leaders, which appear, however, to be void, so far as the party were
able to decide, of auriferous stone.


Ararat Mining District.
Moyston Party,
This party, consisting of C. Sutcliffe (foreman), W. Davis, A. Hodgson, M.
McDonald, and J. Mathew, commenced operations in the Londonderry paddock,
about five miles from the township, and thoroughly prospected the adjacent country
without meeting with any reward for their labors. A move was then made to the
untried ground opposite Lexington station, two miles from the township. Sinking
was resumed, but as no leader or spur thicker than from one and a half to two
inches was touched the prospectors again changed their scene of operations to un-
broken ground between “ The White Patch” and “ Cawood’s,” one mile west of the
township, and continued work, but without favorable results. From the time of
commencing work, early in the month of February to the end of June, when
operations were discontinued, the party sank and bottomed twenty-four shafts,
twenty-two of which bottomed on “ hard mullock ” (after penetrating in nearly
every instance hard cement) at depths varying from 11 to 45 feet. The remaining
two shafts bottomed on a shallow reef at depths of 5 feet and 6 feet respectively.
A large amount of driving was done and entailed much labor, the ground being
close rough cement and cemented gravel.
Armstrong’s Party.
This party, composed of A. Boyce (foreman), W. Turner, R. Whitten, J. Jealous,
and I. Jealous, early in February commenced work near Armstrong’s, and sank
seventeen shafts, in one of which alone a light wash was met with. They then
moved to the Six-mile Creek, near Miller’s selection ; five shafts were sunk, and in
three of them, after passing through hard cemented gravel and large well-rounded
quartz boulders, the color of gold was obtained. Numerous other shafts were
bottomed with a like result.
Derwent Point, 2J miles west from Armstrong’s school, was the next locality
tested. Sixteen shafts, varying from 4to 28 feet in depth, were put down, and in
two only was the color of gold met with.
From the commencement of work until the party was disbanded at the end of
June 578 feet of sinking and 267 feet of driving was done.
Cathcart, SfC., Party.
The Cathcart, Opossum Gully, and Ehymney prospecting party, consisting of
E. Smart (foreman), W. Kelly, T. McCready, E. Webb, J. Mackay, and E.
Symons, commenced operations in March in a gully about one mile south from the
Port Curtis Lead. Eighteen shafts were bottomed at a depth varying from sto 25
feet. The sinking was principally through clay and gravel, with mullocky bottom.
The wash where met was a heavy quartz one. In nearly all of the shafts a little
gold was obtained. A load of dirt from the shaft in which the best prospect was
found, on being washed, yielded 3-J dwt. of slightly water-worn gold. The gully
was tried lower down, and prospects that would yield the same average per load
were obtained. As it was considered that the existence of several gutters running
in a parallel direction containing a little gold had been proved, the camp was
removed to another locality. Prospecting was carried on half a mile south of, and


at about four miles north-east of Rhymney’s Reef, but in neither of these localities
was payable gold obtained. Twenty-four shafts were sunk in the vicinity of
Rhymney’s Reef, and in most of them was a little gold found, though not in
payable quantities. In nearly all the shallow alluvial gullies which were prospected
a slight trace of gold was got. From the patchy nature of the country prospected,
the foreman thinks there may be gold in payable quantities in some of the gullies
he tried unsuccessfully.
Stawell Party.
This party, consisting of A. W. Tucker (foreman), W. Lawrence, E. Parry, D.
Garrard, and J. Shelly, proceeded about the end of February to the head of
McColl’s Flat, and after pitching their tents commenced sinking operations. Near
the top hard cement was met with. After passing through coarse sand, a bed of
soft granite and a drift of sand overlying quartz gravel, No. 1 shaft was bottomed
at a depth of 48 feet, with a good wash, on a soft slate dipping north. On driving
to the bottom of the drift and some distance in the opposite direction a few specks
of fine gold to the dish were occasionally met with. In No. 2 shaft “soft granite ”
was struck at a depth of 18 feet from the top, and was bottomed at 50 feet without
any gold having been found. Various other shafts were sunk through hard cement
without, however, any favorable results being obtained. The country lying between
the “Four Posts” and the West Germania and Darlington reefs was then tried.
Shafts bottoming at 26 feet and 52 feet, 71 feet and 76 feet respectively, were put
down. In one a promising-looking cement wash was met with on the bottom, but
in which no gold was found. In another an occasional color to the dish was got
from the drift-sand on the bottom, and on driving small patches of gravel-wash
were met with from which about 1 dwt. 9 grs. of gold were obtained. Near the
Ironbark Ranges various shafts were sunk, and were bottomed on hard cement, in
one of which only, at a depth of 13 feet, a fine color of gold to the dish was obtained.
As no provision had been made to continue work beyond the end of June, the party
at the end of that month received notice to cease operations.
Great Western Party.
This party, consisting of S. Glisson (foreman), F. Blades, J. McOuat, and G.
Sargeant, commenced work on 16th April at the Great Western Hill. The first
shaft was sunk about 60 chains north-east of the N.E. angle of the township
boundary. It bottomed on granite at a depth of 82 feet, the strata passed through
being—
-5 feet of clay and gravel, 24 feet tight red gravel,
3 feet very hard cement, 16 feet white mullock with brown gravel,
26 feet cemented gravel, 8 feet drift and gravel.
Off the bottom colors only of gold were obtained. At 75 feet water was struck, and
throughout more or less timbering had to be done ; foul air caused some inconve-
nience. A depth of 3 feet was sunk in the bottom for the well, and drives were
put in east and west from the shaft. The eastward drive was put in a distance of
20 feet through coarse granite with cement on the bottom. For 13 feet colors of
gold could be obtained, the remaining 7 feet yielded none. The westward drive
was carried a distance of 28 feet, but without yielding gold.


In the same neighborhood, within an area of two square miles, five more shafts
were sunk and bottomed at depths of 53 feet, 64 feet, 82 feet, 64 feet, and 75 feet
respectively. The geological formation did not differ materially from that given
above. At these five shafts drives of considerable length were put in, but at no
spot was more than the color of gold obtained.
Between the first or 82 feet shaft and the 53 feet shaft there was a shaft sunk about
five years ago ; this the prospectors cleared and timbered throughout, as the ground
was very rotten and wet. They put in a drive westward 32 feet, with at first very
promising prospects, which, however, gradually diminished to colors only. A cross-
drive was put in and a load of dirt taken out and washed ; the yield was only 3 dwt.
1 gr. of gold. The foreman considers “ that this find shows that an auriferous lead
may exist between the Old Lead, Great Western and the Shakespeare diggings, or a
continuation of the Old Lead ; the distance between the two diggings is about two
miles.” In view, however, of the party’s other operations in the vicinity it is
doubtful if the prospect obtained in the above drive is sufficient to warrant such an
assumption.
The party likewise prospected an area of one and a half square miles about one
mile east of Allenvale station. Six shafts were sunk, ranging in depth from 5
to 18 feet. These shafts penetrated clay and gravel, and bottomed on “pipe-clay.”
At the two deepest shafts (17 feet and 18 feet in depth) colors of gold were obtained _
The gully in which they were sunk led into private property, and the party could
not further prospect it.
On the western side of the township the party prospected an area east of the
Black Ranges and in the vicinity of Tea-tree Creek. The ground proved shallow
and granitic. A little gold was obtained in surface prospecting, but none from any
of the seven shafts the party sank.
Work was discontinued on the 30th June, up to which date from the commence-
ment of operations the party sank in the aggregate 584 feet, and made drives to a
total distance of 264 feet. The great depth of the ground, together with its hard
and wet nature, prevented the party from prospecting a larger area,
Landshorough Party.
This party consisted of A. Miller (foreman), W. Phippard, T. Hilton, H. Barnett,
and W. Burrell. They began work on the 12th March, after constructing a camp
on the east bank of Glenlofty Creek, distant about four miles from Dr. Williamson’s
Home station.
Within a radius of about a mile seventeen shafts were sunk through cement and
gravel strata to a shingle-wash. The depths varied from 13 to 25 feet. At some
of the shafts a few fine specks of gold were obtained. From two of the deepest
which were sunk on a ridge south-east of the camp short drives were put in, as the
washdirt seemed promising ; no payable prospects were obtained.
From the above-mentioned area the party moved to a tract of land situated
between Barkly and Darling Flat Diggings. In this area eight shafts were sunk,
varying in depth from 27 to 67 feet. “ The sinking was mostly through quartz
gravel with a sandstone and quartz-wash, and soft pipe-clay bottom.” In four of
the shafts a layer of very hard cement was encountered at a depth of five feet from
2 E


the surface. With the view of ascertaining the width of the wash and depth of the
ground, two shafts about 50 yards apart were sunk. They were bottomed at 67 and
54 feet respectively, and though the wash was of a promising appearance it
here yielded no gold ; iu no place was the yield of gold more than a few fine
specks. The foreman reported—“ We have now sunk right across the wash from
one mullock bank to the other, thoroughly testing the ground, both deep and
shallow.”
The party next prospected Walter’s Flat, two miles nearer Frenchman’s Diggings.
The ground here proved on the average 27 feet in depth, and contained a wash of
promising appearance, but very slightly auriferous.
Glendhu Flat was the scene of the party’s operations toward the close of the
financial year. They camped above the reef that was worked about eighteen
years ago. The foreman reported that for the most part the main flat is
occupied by selectors. An extensive tract of country exists above the reef referred
to, and this was prospected as well as time permitted.
Seven shafts were sunk, varying from 16 to 30 feet in depth. By washing the
whole of the washdirt off the bottom of the deepest shaft 2 grs. only of gold were
obtained. The other shafts yielded very small amounts.
The party returned to Landsborough on the 29th of June.
Raglan Party.
The members of this party were J. Humphreys (foreman), J. Armstrong, J.
Egan, A. Bone, and J. Smith.
They began operations on the 10th of March in a gully at the Langi Kal Kal
Ranges, about six miles north-east from Beaufort. In the locality eight shafts
were sunk and bottomed at depths varying from 6 to 55 feet. In the deepest
shaft a drive was put in. No wash was found, but colors of gold were obtained at
several shafts.
The prospectors then moved west to the parish of Eurambeen, and camped about
three miles north-west from Beaufort, on the Main Lead. From this point they
prospected the gullies lying between it and within a short distance of Beaufort. In
the aggregate fifty-seven shafts were sunk, varying in depth from 5 to 19 feet.
Except at a shaft that bottomed at a depth of 17 feet, nothing more favorable than
colors of gold was obtained. The shaft referred to was sunk in a gully west of
the railway, and from it a drive was made which when in a distance of 12 feet cut
a wash yielding gold. From the quantity taken out in cutting through it half
a pennyweight of gold was obtained. The foreman eventually concluded that
it would not pay to work, and reported —“ We have not met with sufficient
encouragement to spend more time in this locality, the gold being very fine,
and in quality very light, that if worked, would not, I think, give payable
results.”
They next tried ground situated about one and a half miles south-east from
Beaufort, and sank seventeen shafts which bottomed at from 12 to 13 feet in
depth ; only a few of them proved even slightly auriferous.
The party was disbanded on the 30th June.


GIPPSLAND MINING DISTRICT.
North Gippsland Parties.
No. 1 Party.
The members of this party were J. S. Kost (foreman), Hugh Waite, Gustav
Kremborg, John Buckley, and John McDonald.
The party left Bairnsdale on the sth of February, and proceeded by way of the
Buchan River to the Snowy River, which was crossed near the junction of the
Broadbent (Yalmy) River on the 12th of the same month. The party’s first camp
was made on the Broadbent River at a spot about twelve miles from its junction
with the Snowy River, and near the junction of a stream flowing from the north.
The alluvial drifts along the low bars of the Broadbent were prospected, and a few
specks of fine gold were got at each paddock sunk, but no payable ground was dis-
covered. The land in this locality is well grassed.
The party next camped near to where the Serpentine Creek joins the Broadbent
River, and prospected from twelve to fifteen more miles of the river together with
its tributaries. Fine colors of gold “ were obtained in the loose gravel-drift near
the bank of the main stream (the river), but in only one place was as much as half
a grain of gold to the dish obtained; here the bed-rock was a soft blue slate.”
The bed-rock in the river and tributary creeks is a “ bluish slate well intermixed
with quartz.” Very little quartz was visible on the hills.
Leaving the Broadbent River the party pushed eastward to the Brodribb River,
experiencing much difficulty in getting through the scrub and fallen timber. On
the 7th March the River Brodribb was reached, and crossed a few miles below the
junction of the Goongerah River. No alteration in the geological formation was
observed in the country passed through with the exception of an intrusion of a
small belt of old red sandstone.
A central camp was made, and the foreman estimated the position as fifteen miles
south of Mount Ellery, twenty miles from Goongerah station, and fully forty miles
distant from Bonaug. From the camp the surrounding district was prospected.
On the Goongerah River the sinking was through “ a gravelly wash with plenty
of black sand, and it yielded a few fine specks of gold to the dish.” On the River
Brodribb a shaft was sunk which bottomed at a depth of 18 feet upon a “ yellowish
slateno gold was obtained. Another shaft was sunk on what appeared to be the
old course of the river, and in it the bed-rock—a hard slate —was struck at a depth
of 24 feet. Resting on the bed-rock was a deposit of gravel a few inches thick
from which “a few fine colors of gold” were procured. All the tributary creeks,
and the gullies in the neighborhood, were carefully prospected, but not more than
a few colors of gold to the pan were at any place obtained. A large quartz reef
was found to run across the head of one of the creeks, but so far as could be
ascertained it was not auriferous. Also near one of the creeks the remains of an
old camp were seen, but no indications of miners’ workings could anywhere be
discovered.
The whole area here explored is well watered. The geological character of the
valley of the Brodribb is slate and sandstone with much quartz.
The banks of the river are lined with myrtle. On the ranges grow stringy bark
and fine mountain ash ; in the flats and gullies lightwood, wattle, and fern trees


abound. A few white gum trees of great height and girth grow on the flats.
Referring to them the foreman reports:—“ I walked along one of these fallen
monsters of the forest for eighty-nine yards, and had not reached the end by thirty
or forty feet. There are some immense shells of old decayed trees in this locality,
and in one of them we found room to pitch a tent, and shelter for all our horses
comfortably.”
Fern tree Creek, flowing into the Brodribb from the direction of Mount Ellery,
was thoroughly prospected. Six large paddocks were put down along its course,
covering a distance of about ten miles, but in “no instance was more than a grain
of gold to the pan obtained.” Two cuts were made across the creek from hill to
hill, but to no successful purpose. In a terrace about 30 feet above the level of
the creek about a grain of gold to the bucket of dirt off the bed-rock was the best
prospect. The little gold found along the course of this creek “is of a scaly
water-worn nature.”
About ten miles directly eastward from the camp a creek was struck that appears
to have its rise near a high conical-shaped peak on the range that trends south
from Mount Ellery, about twenty miles distant. The rook through which this creek
flows is granite. Certain falls formed by the creek are described as magnificent,
and consist of three leaps of 60 feet, 40 feet, and 30 feet respectively. The
alluvial deposits did not prove auriferous. The best prospect in this neighborhood
was at a dry terrace on the Goongerah, where about 3 grs. of gold to a pan of dirt
off the, bottom of a large shaft 12 feet deep was obtained.
Returned to their central camp on the Brodribb, the party with much labor cut
a track southward to Rich’s River, near its junction with the Brodribb. Rich’s
River was prospected along its entire course, also the terraces and spurs near.
Small prospects of gold were here and there obtained, but nothing of a payable
amount. The geological formation of the locality is blue slate intersected by
quartz veins. Several quartz reefs were found, and generally the sides of the
ranges were strewn with quartz debris.
The foreman in his final report of the operations of the party says:— “ There
appears to be a little fine gold in all the creeks and rivers for a distance of more
than thirty miles up and down the Brodribb, but the amount of gold does not seem
to be sufficiently concentrated to become remunerative for working. The locality
about Rich’s Creek is by far the most favorable for prospecting of any we have
met with.”
The end of June being near by the time the party had finished prospecting at
Rich’s Creek, the camp was struck, and the march homeward commenced. The
river Brodribb was crossed near the site of the camp, and a course as much south-
west as possible followed till Orbost station, near the mouth of the Snowy River,
was reached. Crossing Snowy River the party “followed the high table-land
west of that stream, leaving Mount Tarra to the east, and passing round the head
of Lake Nowa Nowa, cut into the Buchan and Bairnsdale road west of Stony
Creek, and arrived in Bairnsdale well and without mishap on Saturday afternoon,
the 30th June.” Mr. Kost, the foreman, remarks:—“The distance from Mount
Duffy, south of Rich’s Creek, and east of the Brodribb to Bairnsdale, is a little over
one hundred miles by way of Orbost station. A good track could be made by way
of ‘ Manero’ for stock, avoiding nearly all the mountainous country travelled by
the present road by way of Turnback Mountain.”


iVb. 2 (Omeo) Party.
The members of this party were J. Timmons (foreman), P. Cochrane, J. Sandy,
C. Woodward, and W. Stewart.
They left Omeo on 13th February, and proceeded west and north to the head of
the Cobungra River, which was reached on the 15th. Next day they began to
prospect a large alluvial flat near. Two paddocks were put down through about
8 feet of heavy wash, from which colors of gold could be obtained throughout.
The bottom rook was not reached, as at a depth of 12 feet the influx of water was
too great. Three paddocks were opened on the right branch of the river, which
yielded no gold, and five paddocks on the left-hand branch from which colors only
were obtained. The eight paddocks all bottomed on slate formation. Other
paddocks on each branch were sunk, but with no better success. Some quartz
veins were found on the adjacent ranges, but gold was not detected in any of them.
The party from this point moved to the high plains at the head of the Bundarrah
River. Three of its sources were prospected, but not even the color of gold was
found in any of them; the geological formation is granitic. The foreman further
reports that the basalt from the Bundarrah to the head of Little River, and from
thence round to White’s claim, was examined, without any out-crop of wash being
discovered.
A move was next made north-westward to a tributary of the Kiewa River; the
country proved very rough and scrubby. Several of the tributary creeks of the
river were tried, and only small quantities of gold were obtained. Further down
stream, at the junction of its east and west branches, other trials were made.
Bottom could not be reached on the main stream on account of water and granite
boulders, hut at several of the tributary creeks a slate bottom was struck that was
not auriferous.
Leaving the above locality, a track was cleared to the junction of the Diamantina
Creek with the west branch of the Kiewa River. Here several paddocks were put
down, but only a few colors of gold were obtained.
The next camp was made at the head of Brandy Creek, where sinking on the
spurs under the basalt was prosecuted without success. Several shafts were bot-
tomed, but others had to be abandoned, as the equipment of the party was not
suitable for deep sinking.
The party crossed the Dividing Range, and prospected on the Dargo High
Plains, where promising prospects were obtained. The foreman reported that some
of the “terraces” would pay small wages, but to obtain the requisite supply of
water would prove expensive.
On Pic-nic Creek three shafts were sunk, but no auriferous ground was found.
On the spur at the falls of the Little Dargo River the party sank several shafts,
ranging from 6 to 12 feet in depth, before they could find the deep ground.
Having discovered it, they sank a shaft at its edge, that cut through a heavy quartz
and slate wash with patches of cement. Bottom was touched at a depth of 27 feet,
and was of sandstone formation. One other shaft was sunk and bottomed at 34
feet. In each shaft a little gold was obtained throughout the sinking, but not in
payable amounts at any part.


At this juncture, the weather being unfavorable for further prospecting, the
party returned home.
South Gtppsland Party.
This party, consisting of Peter Wilson (foreman), F. C. Knyvett, J. Curran, D.
Black, and T. Barry, left Foster on the 22nd January. They cleared a pack-horse
track from Turton’s track northward to the Tarwin River, and here established a
camp. On a large stream north of the camp seventeen shafts were sunk, the deepest
of which bottomed at 13 feet. In none was even a color of gold obtained.
On a branch of this stream ironstone and a black sand were found. All the creeks
to a distance of about four miles south-west of the camp were prospected, also those
to the north; gold was not obtained at any of them. Colors of gold, however, were
found at a branch of the Tarwin River.
A track was next cut along the Tarwin River, and thence to the Morwell River.
About two miles south of the Morwell River slate bottom was struck, but no gold
obtained. About two miles westward along the course of the Morwell River the
geological formation is, the foreman reported, granitic, and in the vicinity colors of
fine gold were obtained. The foreman reported that in travelling northward from
Stockyard Creek no indications of gold were found till the party arrived within
about two miles from the Morwell River. On this line the country changes from a
rich agricultural soil, thickly timbered with gums, to a light sandy soil intermixed
with quartz, and bearing an inferior timber, undergrowth of native hop, spear grass,
and heath. The party prospected portions of the land along the Morwell River,
and at the west branch. Colors of gold only were obtained.
The prospectors were instructed to leave the above district, and to prospect south
of Foster, in the neighborhood of the Bald Hills, west of the Hoddle Ranges. They
camped at a spot about twenty miles south-west of Stockyard, and five miles west-
south-west of Frazer’s station. The country from Cape Liptrap to the Bald Hills,
west of the Hoddle Ranges (being nearly in a north line from Cape Liptrap), was
prospected. The bed-rock could not be struck, on account of water and sand, till
the party arrived near the Bald Hill, where sandstone rock was reached. Not the
slightest indication of gold was obtained on this track. At Bald Hill quartz was
discovered, and several leaders were cut, but no gold could be obtained.
In the meantime two creeks in the vicinity of the camp, specified above, were
prospected, but no auriferous ground was discovered. On a terrace in the same
locality attempts were made to reach the bottom rock, but unsuccessfully. In one
shaft, at a depth of 23 feet, a layer of hard cement was broken through, and im-
mediately there was so large an influx of water that the men had to leave the
shaft, and in less than two hours the water was welling up and overflowing the
mouth of the shaft. The cutting of a drainage tunnel would have entailed an
undue expenditure of time, consequently further work on the terrace was not
attempted.
The party moved and next camped near a creek (locally known as Dividing
Creek), about six miles north of Frazer’s station, and sank eleven shafts along the
creek, bottoming on slate with quartz wash. Only colors of gold were obtained.
On the flat in the neighborhood, fourteen shafts, varying in depth from 4 to 24


feet, were sunk. Quartz wash was found at most of the places tested, but nothing
more promising than fine colors of the precious metal was obtained. On the most
eastern portion of the flat slightly better results were obtained at one shaft. These
prospects were not, however, again secured, although many attempts were made to
discover payable auriferous ground in the vicinity.
On a cement hill, about half a mile east from the flat, quartz wash with layers of
gravelly cement was discovered, which contained fine gold, equal, the foreman
estimated, to about one pennyweight to a horse load of wash. The ground is from
Bto 20 feet deep. At two shafts 50 feet of driving was done, but no payable
ground was struck. The ground requires close timbering.
The weather being unfavorable for further work, and the term of service of the
party having nearly expired, it was permitted to return, and arrived at Stockyard
Creek on the Bth June.
