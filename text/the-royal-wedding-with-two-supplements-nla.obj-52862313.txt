1 Thursday, July 6, in London lias no mill in English history, it is because
there has hardly been an occasion so full of deep moment to ns as a people,
or one more abounding in national import. The marriage, as we know, was
the marriage of an English Prince, bat, more than this, it was the inamagc

THE BRIDAL PAIR PASSING THROUGH TEMPLE ' BAR.
satiated sightseer admitted that London had never beheld a spectacle so rich, or
one so-worthy of her and the English people.
It was about hall-past ten when the guests invited to the Chapel began
to assemble. These arrived at the Ambassadors’ Court of St, James’s Palace,
and were at once conducted to their seats by the Gentlemeji-Ushers.
Mr. Gladstone, who was early to arrive, wore naval epaulettes on • his blue
and gold uniform, .ns one of the Trinity Brethren, The Lord Chancellor
was in the royal pew reserved for him, and so also were a few of the more
distinguished guests. The First Lord of - the Admiralty, the Secretaries of
State, the Corps Diplomatique, the Cabinet Ministers, the Speaker, Lord Salisbury,
all iu full chess, with many social celebrities and men in Levee chess of the Navy
pattern, and, above all, the many ladies in toilets of sixrnassing beauty, soon
made the spectacle such a one as never will be forgotten. Anon, the, strains of
the bauds in the Throne Room, without the Chapel, were heard playing the
moving march from “ Taimhauser,” there was a blare of trumpets, and the
first of the royal processions arrived. A few minutes later there was a tremendous
wave of cheering coming across the park from Buckingham Palace, the
strains of the “ Duke of York’s March ” were heard from the Guards’
hand, and the bridegroom’s procession reached the Palace, It ■ con-
sisted of three carriages, the first two containing the members of the
household, and the third his Royal Highness, Prince George, , his Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of Edinburgh. When
the Prince entered the chapel, in his Commander’s uniform, looking a
little pale, hut with that firm, upright walk and bright face which ever*
characterise him, the tornado of cheering swept onward again in the streets
outside, and culminated in a mighty resounding roar ns the bride’s procession
reached St. James’s. The sweet Princess upon whom ten thousand eyes had
already been turned in admiration, more charming than ever in her superb dress
of white and silver brocade, pale hut fairer yet in her paleness, entered the palace to
the clash of martial music, the echo of the trumpet’s blast, and that superb thunder
of voices which can never have been paralleled in all the history of enthusiasm.
Her Gracious Majesty the Queen left Buckingham Palace in a procession
which consisted of four carriages. Her Majesty’s carriage . was drawn by six of
the famous “ cream” ponies, gorgeous in gold trappings. There were grooms in
the royal liveries at the head of the ponies, and on the box of the great
gold carriage, used on semi-state occasions, sat the. coachman, in the
magnificent. gold and scarlet coat ; which recent pageants have accustomed
us to. There were the usual gillies at the hack of, the Queen’s coach,
in which the Duchess of Teck had a seat with her Majesty; and it is
needless to say that the same spontaneous earnest enthusiasm' which had greeted
the bride and bridegroom, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the other
members of the royal family was, if anything, more pronounced when this lust
procession left the Palace, and our Gracious Sovereign bowed her acknowledg-
ments of the enthusiasm which prevailed everywhere along the route.
The Chapel Royal, St. James’s, is not a large edifice, hut under such
- conditions ns it was seen on July 6 it looked extremely picturesque. The seats
had been draped in crimson cloth, the altar had been removed to allow the
processions to pass, there was a great white and gold armchair for her
Majesty, and an altar-table, upon which the magnificent Communion plate was
massed, erected especially for the service. The ceremony itself was performed by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, whose fine and stately elocution and
dignified bearing gave grace to the ever-imposing and impressive ceremony
of the English Church. His address to the Duke and Duchess was full
of high thought, exceedingly suitable, and very sweet to hear. It was
followed by a closing prayer, and then as the guns in the park thundered
out the salutes, and the first grand chords of Mendelssohn’s “Wedding
March ” crashed on the organ, the cry which was the nation’s congratulation
burst again from the throngs outside, and in the tumultuous roar of voices the glad
message was borne to the distant palace and the far-away suburb.
The Duke and Duchess of York returned to Buckingham Palace under
escort of the Guards, and instantly all the brilliancy which had
been centred in St. James’s spread over the streets, which glittered
with a thousand hues, or shone yet more resplendently with the gold
and the scarlet and the blue upon which the glorious sunshine fell with all the
fullness of its burning power. It was late in the afternoon when, after the
wedding breakfast in the State Dining-Room at Buckingham Palace, the Duke
and Duchess set out on their way to the station to make a progress which was
royal in every sense of the word. Escorted by a detachment of the Royal Horse
Guards, they passed under the canopy of banners greeting them, of flags speaking
welcome, of flowers wreathed from mast to mast. Through the Strand
and Fleet Street, past St. Paul’s, through the heart of the City, whose .streets
blazed with splendour and with hunting, and so to Liverpool Street, where
they left this ever-memorahle demonstration of rejoicing and of affection.
The illumination of the City began very early in the evening. Hardly had the
twilight fallen when, as at a magic touch, London put on a garb of light,
and in ten thousand places showed her illuminated portraits, her gigantic
gas-flares, her ropes of lanterns and mottoes in fire. All traffic had
been stopped at eight o’clock, so that the people walked freely
in the roadways, and formed a great moving throng extended in an
unbroken battalion from the heart of the City to the boundaries of the rmhurba.
Such a display was a fitting end to an unsurpassable day —a day of triumph and a
day of gladness ; and we may rest assured that none in that tremendous crowd
was not ready to echo the one sentiment which seemed written in letters of fire
throughout the City —“ God bless the Duke and Duchess of York! ”

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON TSTEWH ROYAL WEDDING NUMBER, July 10, 1895.-13
CLORGL ELIO 1 has it that the hnpjriest women, like the happiest
nations, have no history. The royal bride says of her own
childhood that she was “very naughty, very happy, and very
uninteresting.” Her early years were spent between Kensington
1 alace and White Lodge. The change from the former to the latter
was always a welcome one to Princess May and her brothers, since the
lile at Richmond was freer than that in town, and the opportunities for
getting into mischief infinitely greater. No incidents of “ great pith
and moment” marked these early years of a life destined to become
historical; none ro.se to the rank of tragic memories such as many
a man and woman can lecall of their childish days, when experience is
very limited and, the mental horizon being bounded by bed-time, a
trilling thing causes such anguish as to leave a mark lusting on into
grown-up years, when the recollection brings a smile to the lips oven
while the heart goes back in pity to the old child-self. Princess May
had sorrows, no doubt—no childhood is without them—but they have
been so overbalanced by the joys of a natural, happy, healthfiil life,
with dearly loved brother companions and a devoted father and
mother, that not a trace remains. There is a difference of fifteen
months botv eon the ages of Prin-
cess May and Prince Adolphus of
Teek, so that in childhood the «-
young Princess’s great lovableness. Indeed, the way in which her
Highness has attached those to her who have known her longest and
best is true testimony to the beauty of her character and the charm of
her disposition. There was nothing phenomenal about Princess May
as a child: she was naughty, but only naturally, not phenomenally
cveii in her scrapes was always generously inclined and
would have her fair share of blame, and even a little more than her fair
share if it was to save someone weaker, younger, or in a subservient
position. > Princess May did not love lessons; in fact, she went further
off the lines of the pattern good child, for she did not even like them.
Let this, however, not lead little girls astray, and set them imagining
that they can become everything that is delightful and still encourage
a dislike for lessons, because Princess May learnt them, if she did not
like them, and is now a very clever lady, whose lessons up to date
are rapidly learnt, and who is as fond of hooks as once she was
the reverse. The Duchess of Teclc, although a devoted and
indulgent mother, was insistent about education, and so our little
Princess early mastered the first principles of how rightly to
command in knowing how thoroughly to obey.
Princess May was fond of dolls,
and, in common with children of
specially tender disposition, clung
to her old friends even when the
brother and sister were good com-
rades, not often falling out, and
speedily falling in again; for our
little Princess had ever a disposition
which rendered it keen suffering
to be at cross purposes with those
•she loved. Prince Francis is
eighteen months younger than
Prince Adolphus, and Prince Alex-
ander, who was the baby of the
happy family of children, and
alternately cherished and corrected
by his august elders, as is the
usual fate of the youngest, is
four years and four mouths younger
than Prince Francis. Princess
May, whose love of children was
inherent and lias grown with her
growth, was a kind of miniature
mother to Prince Alexander, even
though it is difficult to realise that
situation now, seeing the six feet
odd of fine young manhood look-
ing proudly at his fair sister, who
holds, with the utmost tact and
dignity, the difficult situation of .
being the most interesting indi-
vidual in the Queen’s realms.
Princess May was a strong
child, to whom the times of
ordinary childish ailments but serve
as recollections of being specially
cared for and petted. Pier old
nurse, who was also her devoted
slave—for the little Princess was
in all things a very lovable child—
has been dead some years, her
death being one of the sorrows of
Princess May’s later life. Since
early childhood, Madame Helene
Bricka, a charming French lady, has
been most with Princess May, and
■wear and tear of doll life had begun
to tell upon them, and their clothes
and complexions contrasted unfa-
vourably with the brand-new and
most fashionable waxen ladies con-
stantly given to the popular Duchess
of Peck’s only daughter. The new
dollies had their fascinations for the
beauty-loving child, and they were
trotted out with much pride ; but
the old ones were the dearest friends,
and had their little mother’s eonti-
deuce in all things. Princess May
loved dogs always, and ns a child
had many canine companions, who
joined in expeditions with her mid
her brothers, to tire mutual pleasure
of the children and the animals.
No dog, even in the childish days,
gained so completely her Serene
Highness's affection as her present
constant companion, “Cavil,”a basset
of great intelligence, and deeply
devoted to his mistress, which she
has had now for about six. years.
Princess May was, as girls brought
up with hoys usually are, a ‘‘ tom-
boy,” and could join with perfect,
confidence in boyish expeditions
which entailed jumping, climbing,
and scrambling. Her Highness has,
however, never had the least taste
for masculine pursuits. Although
she can ride, she is not an enthu-
siastic horsewoman—in fact, she
does not greatly care for riding.
She can drive, but prefers to be
driven, very seldom caring to wield
the ribbons herself.

rides with the traditional light-

no great fondness for cricket, it is
rather for lack of opportunity than
for want of a love of the national
pastime. At tennis he lias always

■il i I T has often been said by those who have written character sketches
I) ! :! I of his Royal Highness the Duke of York that from his earliest
i years he had a longing to go to sea. It is impossible to say by what
r ' precise associations this fascination—to which so many hoys have
')1 V, succumbed was begotten; hut it has been attributed to the
, thrilling stories to which ho listened when in the charge of the late
| , Rev. W. Lake Onslow, sometime Rector of Sandringham, aud naval
| instructor to the Duke of Edinburgh. This old-time parson, who as
a raconteur seems to have been super-excellent, had steeped himself
in the salt of sea romance when chaplain to the Galatea, and seems
V/hVN i have settled to his clerical work equipped with as many
iV|';7.rif stories as James Bruce or Do Tott. Aud,’ if ho lias not been
vrl' ,1 1,-1 belied, he told them with such effect to the young Prince, who was
|i, I j scarce out of the nursery, that the imagination of the lad was moved
'(Vijl;-"Ml to the sure and lasting determination that ho would he a sailor.
V y j j lo this idea he clung daring his first decade of life, varying it, no
I/--, - f doubt, in prana pncrilm with other aspi rut ions, even, as every hoy
fj f j | does, with those to become an engine-driver, a guard, or perhaps
h:! rU.j a postman. Yet through all the earlier years the sea ruled supreme in
l his affections, ami when he was not ,
i yet seven years old it was under-

cousins. There it was that
Prince George and the present
Czarcwitch laid the foundation
of their intimate and permanent
friendship. The two ns little
lads were fond of swimming
races together, of bowling their
hoops in keen rivalry, and, with
boyish zest, of emulating each
other in many a game of play.
The Czarewitch’s admiration for
. the English find thorough know-
ledge of the English language
and literature date from those
youthful days. From Denmark :
the family would return to
England in time to be at Sand-
ringham by the Prince of Wales’s
birthday at the beginning of -?
November. There, too, their life
was characterised by the same
healthy simplicity. Prince George
was always full of bright'fun and V :
frolic. It is said that frequently
ho was called in those days “ a
regular little pickle.” The whole 1
of the five children of the Prince ",; V:■;/
and Princess of Wales were often I )- j
to last his lifetime. Ilis present
equerry, Sir (diaries Gust,
belonged to the same term as he
did, and they have more than
once since been, shipmates to-
gether, At the end of one
summer term the Prince and
Princess of Wales c.imie round
in the royal yacht Osborne and
gave away the prizes ; and Prince
George’s two years of schooling
were over. In IK7‘J he went to
sea, in the corvette 11.M.5. Bac-
chante, Captain Lord Charles
Scott. In her gun-room he
met again several of his Britannia
friends who had left the ship
before him, while four or live
ot the senior midshipmen hml
been drafted into her from the
Mediterranean Squadron. Ad-
miral Hornby is said to have
remarked at the time that some
of his smartest niids had been
well selected for this purpose by
the Admiralty or by her captain.
The Bacchante proceeded first
into the Mediterranean and sub-
sequently to the West Indies.
The mouths passed quickly. The
life of routine and discipline
moulded Prince George as it
moulds so many more ; his social
mtik was completely ignored by
officers and men, his whole being
was merged in that of a middy.

brilliant than those of ti c former, hut though the house of Hohen-
zollem has produced great men, it may well bo doubted whether it
has given to the world greater men than has that of Wiirtcraberg.
Kbcriuirt-with-tbo-lloiird, first Duke of Wilrtbmburg and of Took of
the new creation, spent somewhat wild youth, but was suddenly
brought.to a better mind a.tter a visit to the little Carthusian monaster"
of Gliterstein, hard by his castle of ITolum-Urach, hi which ho had
been born. In the monastery church lay his father and mother. The
old prior exercised an extraordinary influence for good over him, mid
completely turned the young man from idleness and frivolity to a
sense of ids duties and <W tion to them, Here, kneeling at the altar
in 14(18, he received the benediction of the prior' before depart-
ing on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Before ho left he had made
his will, and taken every precaution for the maintenance of order
in his territories till his return, and for arranging the succession
in the event of his death. In six months he returned, bringing
with him, in his cap, a twig of whitethorn he had plucked in
Jerusalem, and this he planted in his garden, where it grew to
1)0 a goodly tree. In remembrance of his pilgrimage,’ ho adopted
a palm as his badge, and this appears with his coat-of-arms on his
monument and on his seals. He married Barbara of Mantua, a
beautiful woman, and as good as she was beautiful. An old chronicler
commends her us “ the most admirable and domestic of women, who
could cat bacon and beans along with her subjects.” No man did
more to consolidate the possessions of the House of Wiirtomberg, to
elevate the Swabian duchy into eminence, and to provide for the
well-government and prosperity of his country ; and probably no prince
was ever more sincerely regretted. Before be died, he issued orders
that in every church in his laud the preacher should declare that the
Duke asked forgiveness of any man whom he had wronged uninten-
tionally ; intentionally be had wronged none.
Let us now look at the land of Teck itself. The plateau of
.Krkonbrcchsweiler, that was a primitive stronghold of the original
population, has already been spoken of. Mere and about it some
singular customs survive. One of these regards burials. At an
interment it is usual for those who form the funeral procession to
address the deceased and encourage him to accept what is being done
for him, to laud him and flatter him, and cajole him not to take it ill
that he is being committed to the ground, and, above all, to lie quiet
after ho is buried. At a wedding, the bride has to visit, along with
her party, the houses of her godparents and kinsfolk in order, at each
of which dancing and drinking and feasting take place. The peasants
are a short, dark face, with only occasionally fair hair and blue eyes,
CASTLE OV A FEUDAL LOUD UNDER THE DUKES OE TECK.
and they wear the old Swabian costume. In the Catholic
districts of the Alb the women have blue petticoats, and
the men stockings of the same colour. The men ■wear
on Sundays and holidays scarlet waistcoats or long black
coats lined with scarlet. Sometimes there may be seen
an old peasant with a three-cornered hat. No quarter
of Germany, complained a writer fifty years ago, was so
un visited, so neglected as the Alb—this mountain
Swabian region—and the same complaint might be well
made now. Travellers whirl along the line that is cut
through the Alb to Ulm, they hurry to the Swiss
Oberland or to the lyrolese mountains, and give
not a thought to the district through which
they pass, and which modestly does not expose
its beauties to the travellers in the railway-carriages.
I hose beauties must be sought they do not
obtrude themselves. Beauty is there. If the visitor
expects glaciers and Alpine elevations, he will he dis-
appointed ; if he looks for castles like Heidelberg or
those on the Rhine, he will not find them so great and
so splendid in the Alb ; but if ho can be content with
limestone crags, with wooded valleys, with glittering
streams, with crumbling castles growing onto! pinnacles
of rock, and with very beautiful churches and very
picturesque towns, as also with a quaint peasantry, he
will find all this in the’Swabian Alb and in the country
of Teck. ! ■ *
There is, moreover, n very, remarkable difference between the
plateau of the Alb and its valleys. Above, all is bleak, treeless, white,
barren, and waterless j below, luxuriance is great. The land in the
NEW LOOK-OUT TOWER ON TECK.
bottoms of the valleys is extraordinarily productive and well watered,
and the hill-scarps are clothed/ with beech woods, where not abso-
lutely precipitous. Every jutting crag is crowned with’a castle that
was the residence of some feudal vassal of the Dukes of Teck or the
Counts Uraeh and ’Wiirtemberg. Moreover, the entire region is
honeycombed with caverns. In fact, the whole elevated tableland is
a limestone sponge. In all the abrupt cliffs are tunnels penetrating far
into the bowels of the rock. On the top are hollows —tritchen are what
they are locally called —-wells down which sinks all the water that falls
on the surface, and which gathers somewhere, no one knows where, in
the interior, and issues again in some of the many rivers that burst out
at the foot of the mountains. Stories are told of geese waddling into a
iritchm and disappearing: in the abysses, to reappear, quacking and
fluttering their wings, miles away, from a river source in one of the
valleys. But such tales are not -well authenticated. On the plateau
water is most scarce ; the rain is at once absorbed, consequently the
dwellers on the Alb have been accustomed to form reservoirs lined
with clay to catch all the drainage of the land after a shower and the
water from their thatched roofs. As a good deal of the drainage of
their dung-heaps flows in likewise, it ’may well be conceived that the

thin The red is of a pale hue, and the red and white equally soiu
and ’flavourless. There can be small question that both red and white
are strongly adulterated with cider. .
The cone of Took, that dominates the plain and tho valkj of i
Lauter to its junction with the Neeknr, rises to the height oi - . •
Four miles to the north in the plain is Kirchlieim, the ancient capital
of Took, where the princes of Teek had a residence and minted then
money; where they lived when tired of the windy altitude of the castle.
Of this residence scanty fragments remain, but a palace was built thei o
in 1538 by Duke Ulrich of Wiirtemherg and Jock, and completed m
1556. It is flanked by two tlirce-storcyed round towers, and lias its
own chapel and a terrace commanding a beautiful view of the chain
of the Alb and the soaring peak of Teek m the midst. Formerly m
the cellars was preserved a silver boat called the Bcmavcntuwi, with
sails and cordage, and captain and crew on deck, all, of surer.
Everyone who set foot in the palace for the first time was required
to drink at a draught the shipload of wmc to the good luck of the
Dukes of Teek. The llonaventm-a has long since sailed into the
smelting-pot, and has been coined into florins. It is as well for the
visitor, for a long pull at Kirchheimcr wine would upset his inner
well-being. Before the Reformation there was not only the parish
church of St. Martin in the town, hut also another connected with a
largo convent. In this were buried lour Dukes of Took and their
Duchesses. The church was destroyed, probably, in the llnrty lours
War, and the monuments have not been preserved. In 1818, when an
asparagus-garden was being made on the site of this church, some
tombs were found and opened, hut, unfortunately, wore again luuied
without being subjected to examination.
Immediately under the Castle of Teek is the little town (if Owen,
deriving its name from Alien —meadows —in the midst of which it lies.
This also was a walled place, and a subsidiary capital, of the district
to which the Dukes of Teek of the first creation retired when they
had been constrained to part with Kirchlieim. There also they had a
“ town-house,” but of this nothing remains to attract interest ; , it
has been effectually modernised and converted into a townhall. Ihe
walls and towers of Owen have been destroyed, and all that remains
of the ancient town is the beautiful church, with its lantern-like
lofty choir. The tower is modern above the level of the church roof,
hut' below belongs to an earlier church. In the choir is the monument
to the Dukes of Teek, now converted into the altar and incased in
painted and carved boards. The top slab is, however, provided
with hinges, and can ho turned hack or taken off to expose the
sculpture on the tomb. It represents the helmet, crest, and shield of the
Teoks in hold sculpture of the thirteenth century. The living arc
lozenges sable and or, and the crest a parrot’s or eagle’s head —it is
not clear which—-dressed in the livery of the Tucks, that expands
and forms the manteling of the shield. The vault over which this
tomb stood was opened in the sixteenth century. Thirteen Dukes of
Teek were buried here, hut all had fallen to dust save four, whose
hones and skulls remained. One of these had a hullet-hole in the
water is neither tasteless nor wholesome. Moreover, it is in-
sufficient. In summer, trains of oxen with carts and barre s
have to descend into the valleys and reasoend, drawing water
for miles and up many hundreds of feet. In _ 18G6 a leu
Ehninini, of Stuttgart, formed the scheme of raising water by
tiu’bine wheels to the tep of the Alb, so as to supply the peasants
fIA
/) w
there with the precious liquid, pure and gggjpus, and perpetually
flowing. His proposal, instead of being welcomed, roused the greatest
mistrust and angry opposition. It was not till the King had personally
intervened, and had urged the adoption of the scheme, that grudgingly
and hesitatingly the inhabitants of three villages yielded their consent
to having the experiment made with them. The works were begun
in 1870, and on Fob. 17, 1871, the water, limpid as crystal and
abundant as could he desired, flowed in the fountains in the midst
of the three villages. Great was the amazement of the dwellers, on the
Alb! They flocked from all quarters to see the flowing streams; they
cautiously tasted, and, after demur, admitted that it might, on the
whole, he regarded as a substitute fur the essence of mouldy thatch
and dungheap to which they had been accustomed. That was a
date not to be forgotten—a date that marked an epoch in the Alb.
Thenceforth typhoid and diph-
theria were routed, and with
them stubborn prejudice was
dealt its death-blow. Now the
use of the turbine is advancing,
and before long every railage
and hamlet in the Alb will he
supplied with limpid water.

the Alh are the valleys, that are veritable orchards of plum, pear,
apple, and cherry trees. Above, on the Alb, the cottages are all
thatched; below, in the valleys, all tiled. The fruit forms a
staple product of the lowland; from the cherries kirschwasser is

1348 at Munich. In the church is found a date on a corbel, 1580,
which, however, cannot represent the date of the erection of the
church : the nave belongs to the twelfth century and the choir to the
fourteenth. It probably marks a period of restoration. More recently
the entire church has been carefully and judiciously restored by the
