THE FOURTH ESTATE.
(From the Queensland Free
The sixth lecture of the session was delivered
in the hall of the institution on Tuesday even*
ing last, by Mr. T. P. Pugh, the subject being
the ?Tourth Estate.? The President occupied
the chair, and a large and respectable audience
attended. At the close, a vote of thanks to
the lecturer was proposed by Mr. Tiffin,
seconded by Mr. bwan, and carried unani-
mously.
At the request of several gentlemen, we
shall publish the lecture entire. '
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, ?As
I approached the subject I was venturesome
enough to choose for this evening, the vast-
ness of the theme seemed to tower above me
like some huge Alp, overpowering me witli
its immensity; and I almost blamed myself
foy having essayed to condense, within the li-
mits of an hour?s reading, material sufficient
for a library of volumes. I must, therefore,
bespeak your indulgence, and ask you to for-
give whatever may appear incomplete in de
tail, or feeble in description.
You will, of course, understand that a lec-
ture upon the ? Fourth Estate ? is not sup-
posed to be a history of the rise and progress
of the printing art?that would of itself form
subject-matter for a lecture, but of the press
-the newspaper power of the world?the
? friend of our every day life.? 1 think it
was Macaulay who first gave it the name of the
? Fourth Estate ???when, in his essay on Hal
c.m?s ?Constitutional History,? he says--
The gallery in which the reporters sit has
?ome a Fourth Estate of the realm.? Con-
?d, a French writer, says??the press is
ress of intelligence, and intelligence is
iress of the world and, however magni-
jquent this proposition may appear, there
an be no question as to its truth. I would
I st ask the man who affects to sneer at a
owspaper?supposing there to be such an one

me if it has not grown to be a necessity to
civilized life ? The Herculean task which
the press assigns to itself is accomplished
silently, but surely. Men look to it for
guidance, for assistance, for pleasure, and for
profit. Now we find it fidminating its thun-
ders against some mobocratic onslaught on
the established institutions of a country;
anon, it is pleading, powerfully and earnestly,
for the usurped rights and privileges of a
people. At one time, it is exposing to a mo-
narch official unworthiness or ministerial in-
trigue ; at another, it is sternly censuring re-
gal majesty itself for weakness or for folly. To-
day it records the downfall of a dynasty ; to-
morrow the foundation of another. It may
chronicle, at one and the same time a revolu-
tion here, or kingly oppression there; the
discovery of a planet, or the re appearance of
a comet after a thousand years of absence;
the colonization and rapid growth of remote
territories; the assemblage of parliaments,
and the petty squabbles of paltry place-men ;
the magnificence of banquets, and the strug-
gles of a starving populace, the monstrosity
of a cabbage, or the circumference of a pump-
kin ; and beside all this, the accidents, the
sudden deaths, the failures, the successes, the
suicides, the marriages, and the infinity of
et ceterce which go to make up the history of
eveyy-day life. In the newspaper we have
conjoined the romance and the reality of ex-
istence, and to it we go for information on the
progress of the world around us, as naturally
as we go to history for the events of the past.
The universality of the press is another
important feature for our consideration. Its
influence is well-nigh omniscient; for every-
where does its influence govern the thoughts
and actions ot men. Wherever, in the pro-
gress of civilization, new communities arise,
there may be found the press, fostering com-
merce, and encouraging enterprise. The
agents of the great journals are to be found
in every clime; pursuing their avocation#
under the sultry skies of the tropics, amid


the ice- bound regions of northern Europe, Canning adds no mean testimony,?? He who,
ornrmor fn a onrl onromrï¿½o ~ il. L . i in
among the backwoods and swamps of
America; ?oft-times in peril, frequently dis-
turbed by persecution, and sometimes de-
prived of liberty and life together; but
always adding to the intelligence, and con
tributing to the knowledge, of the human race.
Thackeray says of a great London daily,?
? Her officers march along with armies, and
her envoys walk into statesmen?s cabinets.
Yonder journal has an agent at this minute
giving bribes at Madrid, and another in-
specting the price of potatoes at Covent-
Garden.? How true again are the expressive
words ot De Tocqueville, when he says that
? the newspaper drops the same thought into
ten thousand minds in the same minute!?
The stupendous engine of tree thought and
free expression never tires, never sleeps.
The world may grow tired of orators ?tired
of actors ?tired of preachers?tired of
authors, but the press only lives to extend
its influence, ?growing ? with increasing
years, and strengthening with increasing
rectitude, until it has received the cognomen,
and wields the power of a Fourth Estate.??
Its mission is to oust ignorance from her long
and firmly-held position ; to expose crime in
high places to aid the ? serried ranks? of
progress in their onward march against an-
tique error and antediluvian absurdity; to
humble the despot, and lay the oppressor low;
to fan the flame of loyalty; to foster and de-
velop ? all the arts that humanize and elevate
mankind;? to touch with its own powerful
caustic the abuse of systems; to prune out
the weeds and poisonous plants from its own
domain ;
?To hold, as?twere, the mirror up to nature,
To show virtue her feature, scorn her own image,
And the very age and body of the time
His form and pressure,?
Although it is hardly necessary for a
lecturer on the ? Fourth Estate? to adduce
any very powerful arguments in favor of his
subject, I may perhaps be permitted to quote
the opinions of some of our great thinkers
as to the power and influence of the press.
Dr. Johnson?himself a journalist, by the
bye,?said, ? I never take up a newspaper
without finding something I should have
deemed it a loss not to have seen; never
without deriving from it instruction and
amusement.? Lord Lyndhurst, the vene-
rable jurist, who even now, while bordering
on fourscore, astonishes ? the Lords? by
his energy,?declaimed ?? I am sure that
every person will be willing as I am to ac-
knowledge, in the most ample terms, the in-
struction, the information, and amusement
derived from the public press.? The brilliant
speculating on the British constitution, should
omit from his enumeration the mighty power
of public opinion, embodied in a free press,?
which pervades and checks, and perhaps, in
the last resort, governs, the whole,
would give but an imperfect
view of the government of England." Thiers,
the French statesman and historian, says that
the downfall of the liberty of the press is the
?first symptom of the decay of national
liberty, and has been in all ages followed by
total destruction.? He even says that the
two cannot have a separate existence, and the
history of the past half century in his own
country too truly illustrates his words. When
alluding to the decline of the Stuarts, and
their incontinent struggles for the ? divine
right? of kings, Macaulay ascribes their fall
in great part to the absence of that mighty
moral leverage of which more modern mo-
narchs have availed themselves; he says
?no newspapers pleaded their cause.? ? The
newspaper,? quoth Bulwer the novelist,
? informs legislation of public opinion, and
informs people of the acts of legislation?thus
keeping up that constant sympathy, that good
understanding between people and" legislators,
which conduces to the maintenance of order,
and prevents the stern necessity for revolu-
tion.? Not wishing, however, to tire you
with quotations, I will cite but one more
authority, and that shall be Lamartine, pre-
fatorily reminding you that it is a Frenchman
lam quoting. ? Before this century shall
have run out,? says he, ?journalism will be
the whole press?the whole human thought.
Since that prodigious multiplication art has
given to speech,? to be multiplied a thousand-
fold yet ?mankind will write their books day
by day, hour by hour, page by page.
Thought will spread abroad in the world
with the rapidity of light; instantly conceived,
instantly written, instantly understood at the
extremities of the earth ; it will speed from
pole to pole. Sudden, instant, burning with
the fervor of soul which made it burst forth,
it will be the reign of the human world in all
its plenitude. It will not have time to ripen,
to accumulate into the form of a book?the
book will arrive too late. The only book
possible from to-day is a newspaper.?
In order that the subject may be better
understood by you, and more conveniently
arranged for myself, I have classified my
remarks under different heads, and shall now
proceed to treat upon the origin of news-
papers. Going back to remote ages, we find
that the Eomans instituted the ?Acta Diurna?
and ? Acta Populi,? which may be called the


first forerunners of the newspaper of our time, tification of any kind, and were published at
The ?Acta Diurna? actually supplied to the Augsburg and Vienna in 1524, at Venice in
people of old Rome what the journal of to-day 1563, at Dillingen in 1569, and Nuremburg in
supplies to us?it gave them the news ; and
it is supposed that this written record of cur-
rent events was, together with the ? Acta
Populi? (which was a kind of summary of the
debates in the senate) ?exposed in the forum
for inspection by the quidnuncs of that period.
To give you an idea of the character and
style of the ? Acta Diurna,? I shall here quote
a translation or two by Dr. Johnson, which
appeared in the preface of the ? Gentleman?s
Magazine ? for 1740.
? Pridie Kalend. Aprilis. The Fasces with
Licinius.?The Latin festivals were celebrated,
a sacrifice performed on the Alban mount, and
a dole of raw flesh distributed to the people. A
fire happened on Mount Ccelius; two tvisulse
and five houses were consumed to the ground,
and four damaged. Demiphon, the famous
pirate, who was taken by Licinius Nerva, a
provincial lieutenant, was crucified. The red
standard was displayed at the Capitol, and the
Consuls obliged the youth who were enlisted
for the Macedonian war, to take a new oath in
the Campus Martins.??
? Fourth of the Kalends of September.?The
funeralof Metella Pia, a Vestal, was celebrated ;
she was buried in the sepulchre of her ancestors
in the Aurelian road. The censors made a
bargain that the temple of Aius Loquens should
be repaired for 25 sesterces. Quintus Hortensius
harangued the people about the Censorship and
the Allobrogick war. Advice arrived from
Etruria that the remains of the late conspiracy
had begun a tumult, headed by L. Sergius.?
r l bus we see, in the ? Acta Diurna? of the
Romans, the first development of what may
be termed the newspaper principle ; although
it may come to pass ?when our knowledge
of the Chinese empire has extended itself?
that that nation has long been accustomed to
make use of conveying intelligence, just as it
was acquainted with the principles of printing
at least 600 years before the Christian era.
For a long period, the palm of priority for
the introduction of newspapers was accorded
to the English, on the strength of a clever but
barefaced, forgery, called the ? English Her-
curie,? and dated 1588. Of this I shall have
more to say by and bye. The battle for
priority, however, rests, not with France and
England, but with Italy and Germany, with
Venice and Nuremburg. ? Erzalungen,? or
? revelations,? as they were called, ?publica-
tions similar in character to the English news-
letters of a later day,?began to appear in the
cities of Germany at the commencement of
the 16th century. They were, as I have said,
in the form of letters, but were brought out
?without either name, date, or means of iden-
1571. I must not, omit to mention, with re-
gard to those published in Venice, that it was
during the war with the Turks in Dalmatia in
1563 thac the government of the then power-
ful Venetian republic conceived the idea of
issuing information relative to the progress of
the army, &c., which intelligence was read
aloud in public places, the listeners paying a
small coin called gazeta ; here we find the de-
rivation of the term ? Gazette.? Although
these documents were thus publicly read, the
jealousy of the government would not allow
of their open publication in print till the close
of the century, I shall now call your atten-
tion to the history of the press in England,
and here I must crave leave to enter more
fully into particulars, since the British press
of the present day is the most complete, best
organized, and best conducted in the world.
First of all, I must again allude to the forged
Mercuric, of which three printed copies, and
four M.S., are now to be found in the British
Museum, all dated in 1588, and which were
discovered to be impostures committed about
the year 1766. For a very long time, the
spui?ious Mercuric was instanced as an evidence
of the advancement of the Elizabethan age, and
it appears most marvellous that such a glaring
cheat should have for so long a time escaped
detection by the antiquaries and savants who
frequented the Museum, and at whose hands
the false sheets must often have received a
close examination. The error was first pro-
pagated by Chalmers, the biographer ot Rud-
diman, an early Scotch newspaper proprietor.
Having an earnest desire to eulogize the press,
he sought out among the dusty shelves of the
national museum all the oldest newspapers,
and, on exhuming the Mercuric, he forthwith
announced to the world that England was in-
debted to the sagacity of Elizabeth, and the
wisdom of Bmdeigh, for the invention of news-
papers, ?the first having been published while
the Armada was threatening our shores.? The
credit of detecting and exposing the imposture
belongs to Mr. John Watts, an officer con-
nected with the Museum, and his assertions as
to its falsity are most satisfactorily established
by the facts which he adduces. No mention
is made of any such publication in the works
contemporaneous with the alleged Mercuric;
the type is not of so antique a character as
the date of the paper by some century and a
half?being precisely similar to founts cast by
Caslon in 1766; in the M.S. copies the
handwriting and spelling are both modern,
while, in the printed copies, an awkward at-


gram ?

? ? _/? Tlf.. tTT iL.
vincing of Mr. Watts? arguments?the paper
upon which the Mercuries are printed bears
the tale-telling water-mark of the royal arms,
together with the initials ?G. It.? Having
thus disposed of this extraordinary forgery, I
come now to the legitimate commencement of
newspaper history in England. The first
genuine news-letter was published 20 years
subsequent to the date of thespurious Mercuric,
and divers little pamphlets were issued and en-
tered at Stationer?s Hall, in and subsequent to
the year 1561; but the earliest newspaper was
undoubtedly the ?Weekly News? of 1622. The
promoters and publishers were Nathaniel But-
ter, Nicholas Bourne, Thomas Archer, Natha-
niel Newberry, William Sheffard, Bartholomew
Downes, and Edward Allde, all of whose
names appear in the imprints. The first sheet
bears date May 23, 1622, and Butter?s name
continues to be connected with it, more or
less, down to the year 1640. This Butter had
been in the habit of supplying M.S. letters of
news to parties who employed him for the
purpose, and to him belongs the indisputable
honor of originating the idea of a weekly com ?
pendium of news?of printing at stated periods
what had before been circulated in writing.
The year 1622 was, then, the period of the
appearance of the first newspaper?one of the
most eventful incidents in the history of that
or any other century. And if the event was
so pregnant with interest and importance,
how fitting was the time for its occurrence !
? The reign of James I. was drawing to a
close, Shakespeare?s friends were lamenting
his then recent death; Ben Johnson was poet
laureate; Cromwell was a brewer at Hunting-
don ; and Milton was a youth of 16, trying his
pen at Latin verse.? It was just previous to
that time which Carlyle speaks of as the period
when ? the first world great thing that re-
mains of English history?the literature of
Shakespeare?was ending; and the second
world great thing that remains of English his-
tory?the armed appeal of Puritanism to the
invisible God of heaven, against very many
visible devils on earth and elsewhere?was, so
to speak, beginning.? All England was silent-
ly becoming ripe for that mighty revolution
which was to dethrone a monarch, and plunge
the nation into confusion. What time, there-
fore, could be more fit for laying the founda-
tion of a Fourth Estate, when the king was to
be ranged on one side, and his parliament on
the other?the people being divided between
them.
The derivation of the word ?news? is of-
tentimes attributed to the word new, but this
You will perceive that the clever inventors
took a slight liberty with the cardinal points
of the compass. The cross was intended to
represent them, but the signs for east and
west were transposed, in order that the letters
of the word might follow in proper sequence.
This by way of parenthesis ; and now to pro-
ceed.
Poor Nat Butter?like most other men
who have been venturesome enough to moot
new projects, and like many an unfortunate
newspaper proprietor of these latter times, ?
found that he gained rather more of notoriety
than profit by his ? News.? '1 he unapprecia-
ting public barely supported his paper?the
wits and gallants of the time made it the butt
of their jeers and jests?and ?rare Ben? sa-
tirized it to his heart?s content in his comedy
??The Staple of News,? first acted in 1625.
I am sorry that I have not time to notice some
of Johnson?s best ? hits;? suffice it to say
that they greatly diverted his audiences, who
heartily enjoyed the piquant witticisms in
which the bard indulged at the expense of the
early newsvendors. Between the years 1622
and 1635, upwards of 350 publications of va-
rious kinds made their appearance, and dur-
ing the period of the civil wars, both parties
fought hotly through the press. Before the
commencement of that memorable struggle,
the !Star Chamber had carried on its rigorous
and cruel campaign against presses and print-
ers. Prynne, Leighton, Burton, Bastwick,
Lilburn, Hales, Knightley, and others, suffered
fines and imprisonments, and stood disgraced
iicthe pillory for boldly publishing truths and
appeals which were unpalatable to the author-
ities. Nevertheless the press struggled suc-
cessfully onward, and as I have just stated,
was made good use of on either side during
the war. Loyalist wrote down Roundhead,
and Roundhead wrote down Royalist, and the
partizan prints of the time -now preserved in
the British Museum?tend to show that the
attacks made by their editors on the various
parties were unscrupulous and severe. March-
mont Nedham was one of the boldest and
most pungent writers on the side of the


Commonwealth, and when chances of the war style of a modern journal, and one published
threw him into the power of the royalists, he, in the May of that year contains various
with more gtacc than consistency, employed
his pen in defence of the cavaliers. Ulti-
mately, he rejoined the parliamentarians, and
wrote faithfully for them until the Restoration,
when he relinquished his pen for the pestle
and mortar. An allusion to the biographer
of Nedham, Anthony Wood, will give you
some idea of the animus by which men were
actuated in those times. Wood was a royal
ist to the backbone, a sincere worshipper of
kingly dignity, and it could hardly be expected
that, he would say very much in tavor of his
deceased antagonist. He calls him ?a most
seditious, mutable, and railing author,? and
suggests that the following epitaph?which
had been written for Nedham in 1647
should be inscribed on his tomb in lieu of
one that had been defaced.
?H' relies Britannicus,* Hell?s barking cur,
That son of Belial, who kept datrn?d stir,
And every Maiday spent his stock of spleen,
In venemous railing on the King and Quein
Who ?tho? they both in kindness may forgive him,
Yet (for his safety) we?ll in hell receive him.?
Few journalists of to-day would care to have
such a composition in store for their tomb-
stones, and I rather think that the surviving
relatives of Nedham must have been con-
siderably disgusted at this unflattering de-
scription of the departed Marchmont. On
the accession of Old Rowley, Sir John
Birkenhead was made Editor of the court
newspaper, and he and his coadjutor Heylin,
had to contend against all the pointed darts
launched forth by opposing scribes. And
here I must not forget the memorable ser-
vices rendered to the cause of the press by
that immortal bard, who, as Macaulay has it,
sang ? that song so sublime and holy, that
it would not have misbecome the lips of those
ethereal beings whom he saw?with that inner
eye which no calamity could darken?flinging
down on the jasper pavement their crowns of
amaranth and gold.? As the advocacy of
Milton arose, however, out of the persecutions
which the press had to endure in 1644 and
thereabouts, I must leave it for the present,
as it comes under another division of m j
lecture.
In 1665?famous as the year of the plague
?the first of the government publications of
intelligence, the Gazette, was issued at Oxford,
whither the court had removed, and, on the
return of the monarch to London, it was
issued under the title of the London Gazette
?a designation which it bears to this day.
In 1685, this paper assumed the form and
* The name of one of Nedham?s prints was 44 Mcrcnrins
Britannicus.*'
government notifications ; a proclamation for
putting Scotland in a posture of defence;
intelligence dated from Brussels about the
Turkish army; the trial and conviction of
the famous and infamous Titus Oates for
perjury; and then some advenhements
similar to those which now appear in that in-
teresting and entertaining periodical, the Hud
and Cry. The Evening Post began in Lon-
don about Midsummer, 1709, and was pub-
lished?not every evening?but at stated in-
tervals, in time for the night mails through
the country ?a circumstance which led to the
adoption of the term ? Post? in the title.
The Tatler was commenced in the same year,
and this was rapidly followed by the Spec-
tator, but the imposition of the stamp duty
in 1712 tended greatly to check the spirit of
enterprise which was calling these new
journals into existence. Swift, writing to
?Stella? in the August of that year, says
? Grub Street has but ten days to live, and
then an act of Parliament takes place that
ruins it by taxing every sheet a halfpenny;?
and again, shortly aftei the tax had come into
actual operation, he writes, ?? the Oberver
is fallen, the Medleys are jumbled together
with the Flying Post and the Examiner; and
the Spectator keeps up and doubles its price.?
Passing over the number of Advertizers,
Registers, Intelligencers, &c., which appeared
and disappeared in quick succession, and
which were more or less talented in their
comments on public affairs. ?and merely re-
marking, by way ot parenthesis, that the
Daily Courant, ?the first daily paper ?was
established in 1709, ?I must now come
down to the stormy period when
those prints which now hold on their
way as London dailies first came into
existence. The oldest daily in Great Britain
is the Public Ledger ; it was first brought
out in 1759, and is thus a century old, but its
contents are now purely commercial. The pre-
Morning Chronicle was started in 1769,
sent ? Memory Woodfall? being its printer,
reporter, and editor. Under various manage-
ments, and through divers vicissitudes, this
paper has held on its way until now, although
it has long ceased to occupy a first place.
Not long since, it was purchased by the
Conservatives, and was lately the organ of
the Derby Ministry. Among the dis-
tinguished men who have laboured on this
paper may be mentioned John Perry, who
first introduced the publication of the previous
night?s debates in the morning paper ?a feat
which he accomplished by dividing the lalor


ot reporting ; Lord Campbell, who was its glish press to a close by enumerating a few of
theatrical critic up to 1810; John Black, the oldest provincial journals now existing.
theatrical critic up to 1810; John Black,
Hazlitt, Dickens, and a host of other celebri-
ties. The Morning Post comes next to the
Chronicle in order of date, and this sprang
from one of the then abundant Advertizes in
1772. Bell, Stuart, Coleridge (the poet),
Charles Lamb, and several others, labored to
make this what is termed a ? good paper?,
and they succeeded so far that, when Stuart
?who was the proprietor?sold it in 1803, it
enjoyed a circulation of 4500 per diem, while
its contemporaries only printed about 3000
each. In our day, it has become the fashion-
able paper?graced by the contributions of
the ?immortal Jenkins?, and having but a
meagre circulation. Some eight years after
the establishment of the Post, a misunder-
standing arose between certain members of
the proprietary, and the establishment of the
Morning Herald was the result of the quarrel.
Liberal ?or professedly so ?at the time of its
commencement it afterwards became, what it
now is, the Conservative organ of England,
the ? Mrs. Gamp? of Punch, and the promul-
gator of all that is antediluvian and old
fogyish. The ? Times??the ? Thunderer of
Printing House Square?, and the first paper
in the world?was issued for the first time
under that title in 1788, but upwards of 9CO
mimbers had been published previously under
the name of the Daily Universal Register. It
, still continues in the family of its enterprising
founder, Mr. Walter, and, by the energetic,
persevering, and independent endeavours of
that family, it has been raised to its present
standing, and has become one of the finest
properties in existence. 'Hie Morning Adver
tizer w*s started by the Company of Licensed
Victuallers in 1794, for the protection of their
, interests, and continues to he published under
the same auspices. It is familiarly known as
?the Tizer?, and ranks much below its con-
temporaries as a daily paper.? The removal
of the Stamp duty in 1855 caused a vast
change in the circumstances of the English
press, and a multitude of penny and halfpenny
newspapers sprung up immediately upon the
abolition of that obnoxious impost. Some of
publications?a great number of them
in fact - proved very ephemeral, but there
are still in London and the provinces a host
of penny dailies, holding on their way success-
fully in spite of their long-established
and powerful rivals, and bringing within
the reach of every mechanic the
daily acquisition of the latest intelli-
gence. To mention any of these would be tedi-
ous and unnecessary,and I shall therefore bring
my remarks upon the chronology of the En-
The Lincoln Mercury stands first as to age,
it being started in 1G95; the York Courant
was established prior to liOO; the \1 oicestei
Journal in 1709; and the Newcastle Courant
in 1711. The first of the Scotch newspapers
was published in Edinburgh, in 1 (>GO, in which
year the Caledonian Mercury and the Gazette
were both established. The parent of the
Irish press is tlie Belfast News Letter, which
has been published without intermission since
1737. ? ,
A rapid sketch of the history of the press
in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land must bring this part of my subject to a
close. The Sydney Gazette was the first
paper started in the older colony, and was
brought out in 1825; and this was followed
two years afterwards by the Australian and
the Monitor. The Colonist arose in 1834, and
the Herald in 1835; the Australasian Chro-
nicle in 1838, and the Observer in 184'. The
Monitor was the first to issue as a daily paper,
but this great event for the colony did not
happen till 1841, and the Herald followed in
the footsteps of the Monitor three months fir*
terwards. Ten years subsequently,
Parkes started the Empire, the history ot
which everyone here is doubtless acquainted
with. The Herald and the Empire are now
the only daily papers in the vast and wealthy
colony of New South Wales, unless we can
make a third of an insignificant affair at Braid-
wood, about the size of a sheet of letter-
paper. The first attempt at journalism in the
adjoining colony of Victoria was a M b. Ad-
vertize!*, published and written underthe aus-
picG3 of John Pascoe Fawkner on the Ist of
January, 1838. when there were scarce 4000
sonl< iii the then newly-settled region ot Port
Philip. Of the date of the establishment of
existing papers I am unacquainted, but the
rapid rise of that colony may be inferred from
the fact ?to which 1 shall presently have oc-
casion to allude?that there are now upwards
of 50 newspapers published within its limits
?fen of which are dailies. Coming to the
press of Queensland, the task of euumeiation
is not one of difficulty, inasmuch as we are
only commencing our existence. Iheie are
now six papers published north of the oOth
parallel, namely?the Courier and tree Iress
in Brisbane, the North Australian and Herald
in Ipswich, the Gazette in Drayton, and the
Examiner at Grafton, and it is a curious fact
that four out ot these six papers were each
edited in their infancy by the same person?
Mr. Lyon, now of the Gazette.
I shall now come to consider the obstacles


which have beset the pathway oi the press? Leighton, he being brought before that dread
a topic of transcendant interest, and inex
haustible in its material, since the labors of
the journalist in times gone by,?when battling
for existence and independence,?were hardly
less perilous and exhausting than the fabled
feat of Hercules in slaving the Hydra. The
opposition by which the press was confronted
at every turn was indeed hydra-headed. What
with the relentless persecutions of the Star
Chamber, the merciless and cruel censor of
former times, and the heavy imposts and
ignorant obstructionism of a later period, it
has had quite enough to contend with ; and
this long and wearisome struggle has still to
be fought out in many countries where the
censor still reigns supreme, and where its
onward progress is still opposed by the
bayonets of gevs d'aime.i f and the magnilo-
quence of imperial edicts. Happily for Eng-
land and her dependencies, the British press
has long exulted in the utterance of free
thought and free expression, but, while we
glory in this manifest evidence of true
liberty, we must not lose sight of the suffer-
ings and the labors ot those distinguished
men to whom we are indebted for its acqui-
sition. As we look back along the land-
marks of history, the memories of stirring
events which happened in connection with
the struggle come thickening upon us, and a
shade as of thickest darkness overspreads
the glory of the present. First, we have the
opposition of satire. We find Ben Johnson
making hard hits at speculative Nat Butter
in his comedies, the anti-tobacco monarch
shaking his fat sides the while, and exchanging
coarse jokes with the courtiers around him at
the expense of the newsmen ; and Fletcher
also has his fling at the press in his ? Fair
Maid of the Fnn.? The writers of the news-
letters which went flying about the country
suffered in various ways as their numbers and
productions increased, but it was not until the
infamous plot of Titus Oates that any one of
them suffered materially, and at this time a
writer named Coleman was hung at Tyburn
for publishing.something that w-is considered
treasonable. But we must come down to a
later period for the great struggle, and, stop-
ping at the reign of Charles 1, we find that a
dark spot in the history of the fourth estate,
although the revolution which beheaded him
laid the foundation of its freedom. Book
authors had been persecuted to a most dis-
couraging extent, and it was a bold man who
ventured to deal in anything but news and
foreign occurrences in the papers of the day.
In 1630, the Star Chamber found its first
victim in the person of Dr. Alexander
tribunal for the publication of an ? Appeal
to Parliament against Heresy.? He was
placed in the pillory, whipt, one of his ears
was cut off, and he was branded on ore cheek
with the letters S3?a stirrer up of sedition
?with just as little compunction as a stock
man would have in branding a bullock.
The celebrated Prynne was next brought to
task for fulminating some strong things
against actors and acting, and he was sen-
tenced to the pillory, had both his ears cut
off, was fine 1 ï¿½5OOO, his hook was burnt by
the common hangman, and he was sentenced
to imprisonment for life. This bitter sentence
was not. carried out as far as regarded the
imprisonment, for, in the 13th year of the
reign of Charles I, he was again arraigned, his
pa tners in misfortune being Dr. Bast wick
and Mr. Burton ?the charge being the issue
of various books against the hierarchy.
These devoted and courageous men were
thought to he in such imminent peril that no
counsel would venture to beard that dreaded
judgment seat on their behalf, and their
written defences were taken pro covfesso.
After a lengthened trial, during which they
battled manfully in their defence, these three
heroes in the cause of liberty were sentenced
to lose their ears, to pay ï¿½5OOO each, and to
be imprisoned for life in the several castles of
Carnarvon, Cornwall, and Lancaster. Poor
Prynne had no more ears to lose, but as ho
stood in the pillory at Charing Cross, he
harangued the people in stirring strains, as
did also Dr. Bastwick; and all three bore
their misfortune with the fortitude of martyrs.!
Prynne again escaped his imprisonment, and
when the order of things became reversed, he|
was one of those who prosecuted Archbishop.
Laud, and brought him to the block. On
the Ist of July, 1637, the Star Chamber
issued a decree reducing the number of
master printers, and establishing a rigid
system of licensing. At first this decree was
stringently enforced, but, as the
troubles thickened, and the political atmos-
phere became more cloudy, it was gradually
violated, and a wholesale smuggling trade hi
books began. The Star Chamber revived its
persecuting spirit, its dark shadow once more
fell broodingly over the region of Grub
Street, and "two victims were singled out for
punishment?the one being a venerable old
man of 80, named Wharton, and the other a
youth of 20 named Lilburn. These wrathful
visitations had an effect however, which the
tyrannizing judges never dreamed of. r llie
people looked upon old Wharton as a martyr,
while the injustice and cruelty he experienced


aroused a feeling ot soldierly zeal and puri- porters?took steps to crush what was anta-
tannical fervor in the heart of young Lilburn gonistic to its own authority ; although it we
which ultimately bore bitter fruit to the
royalist party. Tha sentences inflicted upon
them were nevertheless carried out, Wharton
was fined ï¿½5OO and imprisoned; and Lilburn
was whipped through the streets, pilloried,
and also fined ï¿½5OO and imprisoned. Now
we come to a very interesting period.
Wharton and Lilburn lay in prison, but with-
out the walls the great heart of the country
was up and stirring, and Scotland was in a
complete furor. The iron rule of the censor
prevented newspapers being used as the
safety valve for popular feeling, and it ac-
cordingly found vent in books. Proclama-
tions under the royal hand were issued
against them, but they were only treated as
so much waste paper, and tended but to
hurry on the crisis. The king found it ne
cessary to adopt a conciliatory tone towards
his parliament, and, on account of the grow-
ing and wide spread disaffection, he released
Prynne and Bastwick from prison. The
return of these two patriots to the metropolis
was made quite an ovation ; the shouts of the
populace penetrated even to Whitehall,
sounding ominously in the ears of the mis-
guided king ; and the people crowned their
triumph by sending Prynne into the House of
Commons for Newport. Still more humbled,
Charles sought aid from his parliament?the
parliament, stern in conscious strength, ira
posed certain conditions, the chief being a
large redressal of grievances. The foremost
of these was the abolition of the Star
Chamber, and in February, 1641, this
abominable tribunal fell?to the joy of the
people, and the regret of those who would
have bound them down by cruelty and injus-
tice. Mark the result! No sooner was this
great triumph accomplished than the news-
papers sprung up into a renewed life. A
mighty incubus had been removed; the
press began to sniff the air of freedom;
English news was given, and English matters
discussed; and the parliament even sanctioned
the publication of reports of its proceedings.
Indeed, the press almost rioted in freedom,
for, in the period which elapsed between
the year 1640 and the Restoration,
nearly 30,000 pamphlets, journals,
and papers were published of which
we have cognizance, independent of a
host of others which escaped the notice of the
enterprising individual who took the trouble
to collect that vast number. This freedom
was, as we say now-a days, ?too good to last, ?
and we find that the parliament?willing as it
was to give liberty to the prints of its sup
weigh the matter thoughtfully, some kind of
check must have been necessary in those ex-
citing times. In June, 1642, an order of the
House of Commons was issued for preventing
and suppressing any publications that might
contain matter of a libellous nature, either on
the king, parliament, or country ; and in the
May of the following year, another order was
issued requiring that all books or prints toler-
ating or encouraging sports on the Lord?s Hay,
should be burnt by the common hangman. It
was, however, found impossible to crush the
growing power and influence of the news-tell
ing press, and not a month after the burning
of the Book of Sports, another, order still
more stringent, was promulgated by parlia-
ment, restraining the liberty ot the press, and
containing divers clauses for the apprehension
and punishment of offenders. Ihis new re-
gulation proved powerless; free expression
was fostered by the very clash of factions in
those stormy days ; and the attempts of par-
liament to fetter the press called forth all the
energies of the poet Milton, who took up the
gauntlett thrown down, and wrote and spoke
earnestly on the side of freedom. 1 hat im-
mortal man, says Knight Hunt, spake ?in
words worthy of the bard who was afterwards
to sing of Paradise Lost. He brought classic
scholarship, eloquent sentences, and sound
logic to the task, and fought the battle lor
liberty of printed thought with the earnest-
ness and warmth of one who felt strongly im-
pressed with the importance of the cause he
sought to establish.? The battle of Naseby
hastened the day when ? the ruler of the sword
should be the ruler of the parliament;? hotter
and fiercer grew the contentions of either party
through the press, and neither had the power ?
even if they had the will?to put it down. The
entry ofSir Thomas Fairfax into London with
his victorious soldiery was, however, a signal
for the renewal of persecution, and on the 30th
September, 1649, in consequence of a repre-
sentation from the general, both houses agreed
to further enactments for the regulation of
printing, and Mabbot was appointed licenser.
His duties must have been anything but
agreeable to him as a man of honor, for he
soon gave up the post, and after his resigna-
tion, the committee appointed to suppress un-
licensed printing was ordered to sit every day,
and money was granted to aid them in the
discovery of offenders. The revolution pro-
gressed, and the king was brought to the block,
but there were not wanting bold spirits to op-
pose this extreme measure, and the wrath of
the Protector fell heavily upon them. In


1653, Cromwell found his opponents so were brought to trial, but none of them Were
troublesome that parliament again interfered,
but no edicts could stay the progress of the
press, or silence its comments during the Pro-
tectorate. At the Restoration it experienced
a strong revulsion. The Merrie Monarch did
not relish the free and easy style in which
his actions were discussed in the public prints
?the vices of the court were too keenly ap-
preciated to allow of their being freely ques-
tioned by audacious journalists, and, in 1661,
a law was passed forbidding the publication
of proceedings in parliament, and all publica-
tions were placed under the arbitrary rod of
the licenser. This was indeed a blow, and the
lovers of liberty looked hopelessly on the
darkness of the prospect which presented
itself. No printing was permitted, save in
London, and York, and the two universities,
and the results of the censorship were lament-
able. Stayed from publishing politi'-al
writings, the presses poured fourth in full
volume the lewd and ribald poetry ot the lime;
dissipation was fed to repletion with the vilest
trash, and licentiousness held her revel undis-
turbed. So great was the prevalence of this
kind of ? literature??if we may descend to
call it so?that one of the grandest poems ever
written?Milton?s ? Paradise Lost??was
almost extinguished, and the poor blind bard
only obtained for the copyright about a sixth
of the sum he had to pay for his release from
the custody of the Sergeant-at-Arms. Find-
ing all his kingly fiats unavailing in his
attempts to put down the thirst for newspapers.
Charles II had recourse to the expedient of
establishing a government journal, of which
Poger L?Estrange was appointed Editor, and
the title of which was The Intelligencer.
L?Estrange was also appointed chief officer of
the censorship, and many a poor printer was
led to the Old Bailey as the victim of his
persecuting spirit. In 1663, an unfortunate
man named Twyn was betrayed to the autho-
rities for publishing a pamphlet which had not
been submitted to the censor, and L?Estrange,
visiting his house by night, look the poor
fellow in the act, and brought him before
the execrable Hyde. Small was the mercy
that ever came from that quarter, and Twyn
was barbarously sentenced to be drawn on a
hurdle to the place of execution, and there to
be hanged by the neck. While yet alive, his
body was mutilated in a shameful and dis-
gusting way, and his entrails were taken out
and burnt before his eyes. Death having
ended his fearful sufferings, his head was cut
off, and his body quartered, the various parts
being set up to fester and rot on the different
gates of the city. Other parties in the trade '
punished asseverelvasTwyn,anditis well for
our national honor that our criminal recordsare
not befouled by more of these sanguinary senten-
ces. L?Estrange, the prime furnisher of the
courts with these cases and others of similar
character, lived until the accession of William
and Mary, when he was looked upon as a very
disaffected person, and was held m such con-
tempt by the Queen that she made this
anagram on his name?
? Roper L?Estrange ;
Lying stiange Roger."
He died in 1704, at the age of 88, after having
attained the honor of knighthood ; and, al-
though I should be sorry to constitute myself
his judge, I doubt not but that his thoughts
were troubled and his conscience stung upon
his deathbed, as the long catalogue of his
victims presented itself to his memory. Not-
withstanding all the rigor ot the licensing
system during the years of Charlesthe Second?s
reign, multitudes of unlicensed reports of
parliamentary debates and occurrences were
published, and Andrew Marvel was one of
those who contributed thus to clip the wings
of the censors. Nor must I forget to mention
that the notorious Judge Jefferies was one of
the harsh opponents whom the press had to
contend against at this period. The victims
of this fiend in human guise were many, and
the punishments they had to undergo were
severe to the lust degree. Macaulay has
given a graphic sketch of the state of
the press in the later days of the profligate
Charles, and when I read it you will see how
feeble was its condition, and how badly the
people of those times must have fared. (Ex-
tract quoted.) James 11, like his father and
brother, had a constitutional horror of free
newspapers, and his short reign was marked
by restrictive measures of a harsh nature.
When the troubled king found Monmouth
landing in the west, Argyle in arms in the
north, and the shafts of free discussion flying
around him, he asked his parliament for money
to crush the rebels, and a statute to crush the
press. Both were granted, and the action of
the latter gave the courts of law ample op-
portunity for carrying on the crusade?Bax-
ter, the divine, coming into the clutches of
Jefferies as one of the accused. But the
triumphs of despotism at this time were short-
lived , James found his kingship very in-
secure. and he was at length compelled to suc-
cumb, William and Mary taking possession of
the throne. The revolution which beheaded
Charles had laid the foundation ot the liberty
of the press; and the revolution which de-
throned James relaxed fetters which, ?ira-


posed in a reign of dissipation and licentious-
ness, ?bade fair irretrievably to cramp that
same liberty. Soon after the accession
of the Prince of Orange, the dreaded
censorship was abolished, and, as Macaulay
says, ?the government fell under the censor-
ship of the press.? The new monarch?s friends
started the Orange Intelligencer, for the pro-
mulgation of his views and the support of his
policy, but the opposition were well supplied
with counter organs, and the general press of
the country rapidly improved. To the en
larged spirit of freedom enjoyed under the
liberal government of William 111, the people
of England were indebted for the regard to
liberty and the public good which the news-
paper then maintained, and the journalist of
our time looks back with pleasure to the reign
of that monarch, for there he recognizes the
period when the fetters were stricken from the
press, and the licenser's office was totally
abolished. Newspapers increased rapidly un-
til the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, and
her reign is memorable in the annals of the
Fourth Estate, for then it was that a law of
copyright was given to authors, ?that the
first daily paper was established, ?that great
names appeared in the lists of writers for the
public prints,?and (what was by no means so
encouraging,) a duty was imposed on advertise-
ments, and a stamp upon newspapers was or-
dered. Notwithstanding the gratifying suc-
cesses experienced, the press still had to en-
dure a measure of persecution, for, in 1704,
the House of Commons ordered that Tutchin,
the Editor of the Observator, (together with
the publisher of that paper) should be taken
into custody by the Sergeant-at-Arms.
Tutchin had suffered under the malignant treat-
ment of Judge .Jefferies, and it may have been
that the rough and bitter experience of his
younger years lent energy to his spirit and
virulence to bis pen, when he came to occupy
a prominent position in the political struggles
of that day. The puffy Sergeant at-Arms at ?
tempted to do the bidding of the Commoners,
but the bird had flown ?Tutchin was non est.
Like a prudent general, he had beaten a re-
treat when he found the odds against him, and
had retired into concealment, setting the
House and its beadle at defiance. He was
not to be silenced, however, and, while still in
privacy, he continued writing fulminatory ar-
ticles against the parliament, or certain mem-
bers thereof, until at length he fell into the
clutches of his adversaries, ?was taken, tried,
and acquitted. Escaped from one danger he
soon fell into another, ? out of the thunder,?
he was soon ?into the lightning,? for he was
shortly after waylaid by some hireling mis-
creant, who beat him so cruelly that he sank
under the brutality of the treatment, and died
of his wounds. Defoe was among those who
suffered tor the freedom of printed thought at
this time, the talented author of Robinson
Crusoe being pilloried, fined, and imprisoned.
Many others suffered in like manner, but the
press nevertheless flourished and prospered,
and Hallam fixes this as the period when ?re-
gular newspapers began to obtain great cir-
culation, and became the accredited organs of
different factions.? Not only did these news-
papers surpass their predecessors in outward
shape and comeliness, but they came out much
more frequently, and assumed a loitier politi-
cal tone. And at this time, too, as 1 may re-
mark par parenthese, there were started that
class of periodicals among which the Spectator,
Tatler, and Guardian were conspicuous, and
which counted among their contributors
tuat bright galaxy of talent in which Steele,
Addison, Swifr, and Bulingbroke shone so et-
fulgently. But to resume. Anne had been
ten years on the throne when her queenly in-
dignation was aroused by the strictures of
some journalist upon her government, and she
accordingly sent down a message to parlia
ment wherein she alluded to certain ?false and
scandalous libels,? and recommended the le-
gislature to find a suitable and effective re-
medy. The Commons promised to do their
utmost to cure the abuses complained ot, but
the consideration of the matter was postponed
from time to time until the April ot 17i2,
when their memories were stirred up by an-
other libellous utterance, as it was called.
Strong resolutions were passed by the House,
and, worse then all, clauses were added to a
certain act, by which, the newspaper came un-
der the category of ?taxed articles,? being
included in the same list which set forth the
imposts levied upon silks and soaps, linen and
lotteries, &c., &c. The tax was a half penny
fir every half sheet or less?a penny for a
whole sheet, and Is. on all advertisements.
This impost had the disastrous effect ot im-
mediately extinguishing several
and rendering necessary the amalgamation ot
others. So great was the change, in fact, that
Swift remarks, in his journal to Stella, ?all
Grub Street is ruined by the Stamp Act.? In
1713 or 1714, the illustrious Steele was ex-
pelled from the House for writings which were
held to be libellous and seditious. He de-
fended himself with great force and eloquence,
and was bravely supported by Walpole, but
the votes gathered together by the Tory
ministry were too much for him, and he was
thrust out. The example of the Commons
appears to have been followed by the Execu


live, for prosecution succeeded prosecution,
mid multitudinous were the fines inflicted.
The reign of George I found the daily papers
increased to three, and there were ten others
published three times a week, independent of
numerous weeklies, so that the progress of the
press was an established and gratifying fact?
the stamp and advertisement duty notwith-
standing. Eleven years after the accession
of the house of Hanover, the House of Com-
mons found it necessary to amend the Stamp
Act, it having been evaded in numberless in-
stances by altering the size of the sheet, and
making it of smaller and larger dimensions
than those prescribed by law. In the reign
of George 1 i the demand for newspapers had
so increased, and the pressure of the tax was
found to be so irksome, that numerous un
stamped publications appeared. Fresh mea-
sures of a restrictive character were thought
necessary; in 1734 provision was made for
the punishment of all such illegal prints, and
a reward to informers soon tenanted the gaols
with the dealers in unstamped journals. Many
attempts were made in this'reign to prevent
the publication of the. parliamentary debates
as they appeared, but they were unsuccessful,
several members speaking in favor of the
liberty of the press. In June. 1762. the cele-
brated Wilkes assumed the editorship of the
North Briton, which had been started a short
time before, and made for himself a name in
history by his bold and vigorous denunciations
of Toryism, and his expulsion from the Com-
mons for the offence. Burke and Sheridan
were great advocates for the liberty of the
press in their day, and the commotion caused
by the letters of Junius occasioned proceed-
ings which gave them, and other great like-
thinking men, ample room for the exercise of
their splendid talents. The year 1771 saw a
decisive and most memorable battle fought
between the parliament and the Fourth Estate,
The Commons made a complete onslaught on
the press in order to put down the practice of
publishing debates, and to stay what they
imagined was becoming a nuisance, namely?
the bold mention of names in the discussion of
public affairs. Honourable members found it
inconvenient that tbeir constituents should
become acquainted with their doings and say-
ings in parliament; the dignity of the House
was offended, and the press was looked upon
as a nuisance. Things are coming to a pretty
pass, said honourable members. We are not
to speak without having what we say spread
broadcast through the land ; our interest and
our seats depend upon the stoppage of this
pernicious practice, and stop it we will. The
irate gentlemen might have added, if we ?can.?
A stormy debate ensued, the majorities ran
from 143 to 70, and the minorities from 55 to
10, and six offending printers were ordered to
attend the House. Some were reprimanded
?one was in the custody of the Lords for a
similar so-called misdemeanour?and another,
who refused the summons, was taken into
custody by the Sergeant-at-Arms for con-
tempt. Two printers, Wheble and Thomp-
son, were arrested and carried before Aider-
men Wilkes and Oliver, who not only released
them, but bound them over to prosecute their
captors for assault and false imprisonment.
The printer of the Evening Post was
arrested by a messenger from the Com-
mons at his own residence, where-
noon he demanded to be taken before the
Lord Mayor, and was accordingly carried
to the Mansion House, where were also Al-
dermen Wilkes and Oliver. The deputy
Sergeant-at-Arms demanded the prisoner in
the name of the Speaker, but the
Lord Mayor refused to surrender him,
and asked for what crime, and upon
whose authority, the printer had been
arrested. The officer said it was by a war-
rant from the Speaker, but tlie worthy city
magnates decided, in defiance of the House,
that the warrant was invalid, inasmuch as it
was not endorsed by a city magistrate; and
they not only released the printer, but made
out a warrant for the committal of the mes-
senger for trial for assault and false imprison-
ment. When these bold steps were reported
to the House, the Commons grew furious?a
most animated debate took place, full of angry
feeling and acerb expression,?the majority
declared that the Lord Mayor had taken a
step which struck at the very existence of the
House of Commons, and his lordship was
summoned to the bar. He pleaded to be
heard by counsel, and justified his procedure
on the ground of his being the guardian of
the rights of the citizens of London. It was
at length agreed that his lordship should be
beard by counsel, so that it did not affect the
privileges of the House ; the clerk of the
Lord Mayor?s court was ordered to attend
with the book of recognizances; he was com-
manded to erase the recognizance of Welfham,
the messenger, from the book; and a resolution
was passed that no further proceedings should
be taken in law. While this violent scene
was being enacted, most of the liberals quitted
the House?saying that it was nothing more
than an act of the most arbitrary despotism?
a stoppage of the course of justice?and a sus-
pension of the law of the land.
As soon as the state of the Lord Mayor?s
health would permit?(the worthy functionary


had been suffering from the gout)?he attended
the House, vindicated his position, and gloried
in having upheld popular liberty. The House
voted it a breach of privilege that the Mayor
had released the printer, and another to hold
the messenger to bail. Still further to show
its acerbity and exasperation, the House pro-
ceeded against Alderman Oliver, and a motion
was carried for his committal to the Tower,
after he had declared the satisfaction he felt
in having had the opportunity of protecting
the rights of a citizen. The city was in a
complete ferment?the Common Council sup-
ported their Mayor and Aldermen ?and the
populace almost regarded them as demigods.
As the magistrates passed from the Mansion
House to the Commons, and from the Com-
mons to the Mansion House, they were ac-
companied by a large concourse of people,
who cheered them lustily, and gave such
cause for alarm that the military and the con-
stabulary were held in readiness to quell any
disturbance that might arise. The Commons,
exasperated, sent the Mayor to the Tower?
he having refused to accept of leniency on
account of his illness ?and he there joined
Oliver, who had been already incarcerated.
When the carriage of the Lord Mayor left
Westminster yardthepopulacetookthe horses
out, and dragged the vehicle through the
streets of the city in triumph, his lordship
being greeted on all sides by acclamations.
The magistrates remained in the Tower until
the prorogation of the House in the July of
that year, by which time it must have drank
the cup of humiliation to the dregs, seeing
how contemptuously its summonses were
treated on all hands, 1 hope you will not
think I have dwelt too long upon this episode
in the history of the press, for it cannot be
regarded merely as a passing struggle. The
benefits it secured to the British nation are
enjoyed to this very day?the battle was
hard fought, but the end was a glorious
triumph, for the grand point was gained, and
the debates have been. regularly published
ever since. It is true that the parliament did
not, and has not, made any formal concession
of leave, but they have never since dared to
attempt the total expulsion of the Fourth
Estate from its place in the House. And
this memorable struggle had another benefi-
cial result. It gave the great mass of the
people of England to understand the power
of the mighty engine which had thus reared
itself up in defiance of the imperial parliament,
and the press was thenceforth to be looked
upon as the guardian of popular liberty?the
bulwark of the British nation ; and subsequent
to this time, each succeeding storm that has
broken over it has only left the atmos-
phere around it clearer and brighter than
before. But todetail everything is impossible,
and I must therefore bring this part ot my
subject to a close by rapidly epitomizing the
current of events down to the present day.
The reign of the third George was memorable
for the number of enactments then passed
affecting the publication of intelligence, and
for the number of prosecutions for libel which
were brought before the law courts; poor
Woodfall being one of those who suffered
heavily in the last quarter of the 18th century,
he being sued and prosecuted on all hands for
the indiscretions and extremisms of certain
writers in the Public Advertizer. In 1789,
Mr. Pitt augmented both the stamp and
advertisement duties, and this measure?
coupled with the acts of that willing tool of
George HI, Lord Eldon,?made the press
still further feel the weight of authority.
Opposed to the power of the court, and the
vindictiveness of Eldon, was the eloquent
Erskine, whose name will be handed down to
the remotest posterity for his brilliant oratory,
and as a foremost champion of free thought
and free expression. The great pleader de-
fended Tom Paine in 1792, when that indi-
vidual was prosecuted for a political libel, and
the speech of the eloquent lawyer is repeatedly
cited when the fourth estate is assailed. I
should like to have been able to quote length-
ily from this splendid specimen of oratory,
but time will not allow, and I must content
mvself with recommending those who have
not read it to do so at the first opportunity.
Sheridan, too, exercised his transcendant
talents in favor of the full and free exercise of
thought and expression- and he, in conjunction
with other gentlemen on his side of the House,
established an association under the title of
the ? Society of Friends of Liberty of the
Press,? In his speeches, he repeatedly
pointed out its value as an unfettered
institution, and the lamentable consequences
which would inevitably result from any sue-
cesful effort to trammel it. It was on some
such occasion that he uttered this well-known
and memorable sentence :?? Give me but the
liberty of the press, and I will give to the
minister a venal House of Peers?l will give
him a corrupt and servile House of Commons
_I will give him thefull sway of the patronage
of office ?I will give him the whole host of
ministerial influence?l will give him all the
power that place can confer upon him, to
purchase up submission, and overawe re-
sistance ?and yet, armed with the liberty of
the press, I will go forth to meet him undis-
mayed?T will attack the mighty fabric he


has reared with that mightier engine?l will
shake down from its height corruption, and
bury it amidst the ruins of the anuses it was
meant to shelter.? The outset of the present
century found Napoleon Bonaparte following
the example of an hmperor of Russia, and a
Queen of France, and claiming justice in the
high court of Westminster, he having been
attacked in a newly-started paper called
?L?Amhigu,? by M. Peltier. The case was
tried in February, 1803, before Lord Ellen -
borough and a special jury, Mr. Attorney-
General Perceval prosecuting, and Mr. Mack
intosh (afterwards Bir .James) defending.
Napoleon obtained a verdict, notwithstanding
all the eloquence of Mackintosh, but war
soon broke out, and Peltier escaped sentence.
As 1 have previously stated, various re-
strictions were imposed upon the press
throughout the reign of George 111, in the
way of taxes, bonds, and penalties, and the
odious stamp duty was at one time raised to
4d. a sheet?a I'ate which must have been
positively ruinous to many newspaper pro-
prietors. Under William IV, in 183G, it was
reduced to Id, at which' point it was retained
until its abolition. Passing over with a mere
mention the name of Hone, who thrice
bearded the partial Kllenborough at the Old
Bailey, and each time came oft? victorious; ?
of Leigh Hunt, the now aged veteran, who
often had to suffer imprisonment with his
brother; of Perry, of Stuart, ofCobbett, and
a legion of others who bore their part in the
battle for freedom of opinion, 1 now come
down to the reign of our own good Queen
Victoria?God bless her! No Star Chamber
exists?no censor?no licenser; no cruel per-
secutions are waged against the journalist by
cruel judges; but the last remaining fetters
are being stricken from the limbs of the full-
grown giant. In 1853. the advertisement
duty was taken off, and in 1855 the stamp
duty was repealed. No longer need a paper
come out with the ugly red brand in the
corner, and no longer need proprietors shake
in their shoes for fear of violating the Stamp
Act, or incurring the penalties which at one
time followed that violation. But these are
not the only triumphs of the period. Re-
peated actions for libel have called forth
repeated expressions in favor of liberty from
the great judges of our day and generation,
and men are now compelled to recognize the
right of the journalist to comment freely on
the public acts of public men.
Through all the multitude of obstacles
which have been enumerated, the watchword
of the Fourth Estate has been ? Forward !?
Surmounting difficulties, braving perils,
hazarding its very existence against long odds,
it has manfully pursued its course, and Eng-
land at length sees the consummation?freedom
in all its fulness and vigor. It may be well
that the ordeals through which it has passed
have been severe, for, if liberty had come full
upon it at the first,the press might have suffer-
ed materially from unnatural growth,and might
have become a dwarf in strength and vigour,
though a giant in its proportions. The
world can scarcely sum up the debt of grati-
tude which it owes to the memory of those
who sustained the crusades against tyranny
and oppression in times gone by; and when
we take up a newspaper of to-day and chuckle
within ourselves at the freedom pervading its
columns, let us not forget that it is all the
result of a long and wearisome struggle.
'1 he power, influence, and present position
of the Fourth Estate are the points to which
1 shall next draw your attention, and here I
shall be as brief as possible in my remarks.
When Galliani, the astrologer, first exhibited
a printed impression to Louis XI of France,
that monarch motioned him away with an im-
patient gesture, and said? ?We have nothing
to do with it in our day, it is for the future.
Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.?
Like many of his contemporaries,and like many
who came after him, Louis was shortsighted,
and was quite unable to grasp at a right con-
ception of the infantine achievements of
science. The thing judged to be ?evil?
by Louis has influenced the history of nations
since his bones sought rest in the shrines of
St. Denis, and its power for good or evil is
universally admitted. Wherever life and
liberty are granted to the press, the whole
course of society is changed, and men become
accustomed to a freer air, and a more open
spirit of discussion. The political toast which
emanated from Sheridan?s society, and which
was first given at a dinner at the Crown and
Anchor, may be truthfully repeated by Eng-
lishmen for generations to come, and fre-
quently has it been responded to with en-
thusiastic plaudits since his time, ? The
liberty of the press?it is like the air we
breathe?if we have it not we die.? Armed
with this liberty, the press of our day does
not scruple to call in question the justice
or righteousness of sovereigns?the trust-
worthiness or patriotism of parliaments?the
impartiality of judges?and the public cha-
racter and conduct of prominent individuals.
It boldly attacks the domineering influence
of red tape and the imbecility of old fogyism
in the administration of naval and military
affairs ; and in the management of public in-
stitutions, it may well be called a ? Comp-


troller General.? It is the popular educator
?the public instructor?the inculcator of
morals?and the guardian and vindicator of
popular rights. It is true that at certain
times, when these rights have been en-
dangered by the false ardour of demagogues
and the intrigues of designing men, there has
been found a portion of the press venal enough
to uphold the dogmas of the assailing party ;
but the fairest skin will have its blemish, and
as long as society exists, great agencies will
be perverted and abused to gratify depraved
and vitiated tastes. I would not for one
moment attempt to apologize for, or palliate,
the conduct of those who abuse the power
placed in their hands, and prostitute the
freedom of the press for their own vile and
paltry purposes. The diversities of human
nature manifest themselves as much upon the
broad sheet as they do in the stir and bustle
of everyday life, and the ? crack of doom?
will find upon our world a more heterogeneous
conglomerate of human nature than met the
rising waters of the deluge. ? Foul is fair,
and fair is foul,? as the old proverb hath it,
and there will always be a portion of the press
doing evil, by way of counterpoise to the
loftier efforts of the other portion.
If the ? liberty of the press? was said by
the liberals of Sheridan?s day to be ? like the
air we breathe,? liberty is no less the vital
breath of the press itself, and nowhere is that
liberty appreciated so well, employed so
beneficially, or defended so earnestly, as in our
fatherland. It may and does chance at times
that libellers figure in the courts of law, but
these prosecutions are oftener attributable to
the abuse I just now alluded to, than to the
legitimate use of the freedom enjoyed, and the
press of England stands on a firm and impreg-
nable basis. However loud may be the
thunders that roll over it, however ominous
the deep mutterings of the earthquake that
threatens to undermine it, it stands secure in
its own strength and majesty?an essential
part of the greatness of that ? empire upon
which the sun never sets.?
Turning to America, we there find that
liberty outstrips itself, if I may so speak.
The so-called ?freedom of the press? exhibits
itself in licentiousness of expression, and
extravagance of idea. Brother Jonathan
chews and whittles, ? liquors? and expectorates,
while ruminating on his boasted ability to
? lick all creation, and the Britishers into the
bargain,? but he is a perfect compound of
incomprehensibilities. His is the freest
country on ? airth,? his dollar is ? almighty,?
bis traders are ? ?cute,? his senators are
? tarnation good spouters,? his mariners are
? spry,? and his daughters ? beewtiful," ?but
his stars and stripes wave over the head-
quarters of slavery, and the boasted liberty
of his press and his people sounds but a
hollow mockery when we see the laws of
nature openly violated, and the arena of the
Senate-house made the fighting-ground i f
duellists. In Britain, on the contrary, the
liberty enjoyed by the press chimes in har-
moniously with the freedom of her institutions.
She understands the value of the press, and
makes full use of it, but she employs the
liberty with which it has been endowed tor
high and noble ends, worthy the grandeur of
its position, and worthy of so great a nation.
A free press is essential to the prosperity
of a country, no less than to its liberty, and
the newspapers of a nation may always be
taken as the indices to its social and political
condition. Wherever it has been fettered,
whenever this mouth piece of free expression
has been gagged, calamity has inevitably fol-
lowed. Hallam justly remarks?? For almost
all that keeps up in us, permanently and
effectually, the spirit of regard to liberty and
the public good, we must look to the
unshackled and independent energies of the
press.? Monarchs and statesmen have dis-
puted the correctness of this proposition, but
have invariably ran their heads against an
adamantine wall. Wherever the press is free,
the country is prosperous, and a relative
statement ot the number of newspapers in
the different countries, and in our own
colonies, will substantially support this state-
ment. I shall have to give, in each case, the
latest authentic information I have been able
to obtain, and then leave you to judge of the
probable increase or decrease by the advance-
ment or retrogression of each country since
the dates mentioned. The United States
stand first on the list in point of numbers,
but we must not be surprised at this when we
remember the vast area owned by the re-
public, and the millions of reading people
who are spread over its surface. As far back
as 1850, according to Mr. Trubner, there
were 254 dailies published in the States, and
there were upwards of 2000 others, while, in
the same year, there were only 17 daily
papers in all f-reat Britain. In the opening
lecture of this session, our President alluded
to certain gratifying and astonishing signs of
progress which he had witnessed on the
borders of American civilization, and you
may form some faint idea of the rapid spread
of population and intelligence in the States
when I tell you what has been done by the
press in the Minnesota territory. In April
1849, that state was a perfect wilderness, and


printing was not practised within its confines;
but in 1856, there were 3 daily and 31 weekly
' or other papers in the territory. In 1857
there were 20 journals printed in Kansas, not
one of which existed in 1853. New York
had no less than 120 daily papers in 1856,
and in the same year there were 113 in
Boston, 76 in Philadelphia, and 16 in Cincin-
nati, the aggregate annual circulation amount-
ing to the almost incredible total of
171,000.000 for these four cities alone, and
all of them cheap papers too! In 1853,
according to a parliamentary return in my
possession, there were 1087 papers of
all classes in the United Kingdom,
stamped according to the act, but
a considerable per centage must be
taken off of this number for price currents,
mercantile circulars, &c., which were stamped
by their proprietors to ensure free transmission
by post; but there cannot now be less than
KIOO bona fide newspapers published in Great
Bri tain. The influence of the London dailies
may be gathered from a statement of their
circulation in 1853, but it must not be forgot-
ten that they were sold at 6d., while their
Yankee brethren were sold at a cent or two.
The 'l'imes in that year circulated 13,903,670;
the Daily News 1,165,168; the Morning Ad-
vertiser 2,292,818 ; the Morning Herald
1,263,538; the Morning Post only 829,125;
and the Morning Chronicle?once the first in
point of numbers, not more than 624.500. In
the metropolis and the provinces there are
now a large number of dail es, thanks to the
removal of the stamp, but I must not go fur-
ther into detail as regards the press of Eng-
land. The Germanic States, considered
unitedly, rank next for the number of news-
papers published, there being about 350 in
1856 ; and in the same year there were in
France about 100, in Russia and Poland 50,
in Denmark 85, in Belgium 65, in Portugal
26, in Spain 24. in Austria 10 ; in Asia 30;
in Africa 14 ; and in Canada (east and west)
there are now 209. To complete the list there
are at present in New South Wales 30 news-
papers, including 2 dailies; in Victoria 45,
including 9 dililies; in South Australia, as I
am informed, about 12. with 3 or 4 dailies ; in
Tasmania about 8, with 2 or 3 dailies ; in
New Zealand 11 ; and in Queensland 6. The
noticeable point in glancing over these figures
is?that they are the true criteria of the posi-
tions of the several countries. Russia, the
largest country in continental Europe, has but
50 newspapers, even including those published
in Poland, and the pen of the harsh censor
makes the perusal of a Russian newspaper
exceedingly flat, stale, and unprofitable. Of
Spain it was said not long since that a journal-
ist could be found in every prison, and the
statement was not far short of truth. Free
expression of all kinds is there cramped and
stunted; popular freedom is in reality un-
known ; and the nation that was once among
the proudest ot the earth now seeks to prop
up its decaying dignity by abrogating the li-
berties of her subjects, and fettering an already
enfeebled press. But if the press of Russia
be in a bad state, and that of Spain in a worse,
surely Austria supplies us with the superlative
? worst , for she stands with regard to news-
papers as she stands m the matter of credit,
lowdown in the lowmst scale. There, a sys-
tem of espionage places every man under
surveillance?the nobles look down with su-
premest contempt on the other classes ?men
are forced into this, coerced into that, and
frightened into the other thing,?and the house
of Hapsburgh rules over a nation of com-
parative slaves. It is to the Anglo-Saxon
race and Anglo-Saxon spirit w 7 e must trust
for an extension of true liberty, and for the
spread of civilization and intelligence through
the press. After thinking and reading of the
state of things in other lands, the mind is all
elate when it reverts to the mother country,
the heart beats high, and a feeling of national
pride comes welling up in the bosom when
we think and know that the press of Great
Britain, of her dependencies and her offshoots,
stands conspicuous and unapproachable for
greatness, usefulness, and freedom.
To explain the complicated machinery of
a daily newspaper, and to show how manifold
are the agencies necessary to support and up-
hold an undertaking of the kind, would have
required more time than is allotted to the
whole lecture itself, and I must therefore con-
dense the observations I should have made.
The annual expense of working a London
daily of the present time is not less than
ï¿½25,000, independent of the immense outlay
for paper. The staff is legionary, and the
avenues through which intelligence reaches
its columns are varied in the extreme, and are
almost numberless. Next to the editors and
sub-editors, comes the reporting staff?
the gentlemen whose arduous task it is to
? make good speeches for bad speakers??to
sift out from the immense volume of parlia-
mentary chaff a sufficiency of grain for the
delectation of the constituencies?to attend
meetings, concerts, theatres, rows, fights,
races, regattas,?to wait on fires, watch the
progress of floods, be as much a part of an
inquest as the coroner himself; to be every-
where, note everything, and be growled at by
everybody. As I have previously remarked,


the parliamentary corps of the various Lon-
don papersjiave included some of the highest
intellects, the most brilliant wits, and the
shrewdest intelligences of which the country
can boast. Lord Camplelh .Judge 'lalfourd,
William Hazlitt, Chailes Dickens, Sir .lames
Stephen, Samuel Warren, and many more who
have made themselves famous, sat in the gal-
lery or otherwise did duty ; and 1 believe 1 am
correct in stating that the Kesident Judge of
this district was once a member of the ?press
gang.? The late Mr. Windeyer, a magistrate of
thiscolony, was a? Lords? reporter before gal-
leries for the accommodation ot the press were
thought of; and he was the first to venture
to rest his notebook on the bar of their lord-
ships? house, at a time when the messengers
were instructed to strike all note books from
the hands of those who held them. While
busy with his pencils on one occasion, Mr.
Windeyer?s note-book was swept out of his
hands by the robe of Lord Chan-
cellor Eldon, as his lordship was on his
way to meet the Commons, whereupon the
latter immediately stopped, pit ked up the
book, and returned it to Mr. Windeyer with
an engaging smile. r lhe gallery men of the
present time are quiet, orderly personages,
punctual in their attendance, and perfect in
their profession, but, at the time when they
were first accommodated with a gallery for
their own use, there were some comical
characters among them?men who were
spoken of as one bottle, two bottle, or three
bottle men, who were jolly livers, and well-
known habitues of Bellamy?s, Mark Supple
was about the most celebrated of these. lie
was a big, burly fellow, full of wit and humour,
and oftentimes as full of wine ; and he used
to ? dress? up the speeches of hon. members
for the Chronicle in such a free and easy
style that few recognized their own verbiage
again. One evening, when ? particularly full
of meat and wine,? he occasioned a scene in
the House wh'ch must have delighted him ex-
ceedingly. There was a total pause in the
debate?the Speaker (Addington) sat primlv
silent in his chair?Pitt was twirling his
thumbs ?and hon. members were wondering
who would rise nest, when the House was
momentarily petrified by hearing a loud voice
call out lustily in the gallery, ?A song from
Mr. Speaker.? The first surprise over, the
whole House was in a roar?Pitt nearly rolled
off his seat with laughter?Addington looked
the picture of insulted dignity, and the Ser-
geant-at-Arms rushed frantically into the
gallery to arrest the daring offender. Supple
satmute on a hinder bench in the reporter's
row, and looked as grave and imperturbable
as innocence itself. The Sergeant bustled
about in a violent fume, and at length Supple
pointed out to him a meek-looking Quaker
sitting in the Stranger's gallery, and Broad-
brim was at once taken into custody. T He
Quaker protested bis innocence, and Supple
at length relieved the victim of his joke by
confessing bis fault and remaining in custody
to the end of the sitting. On another occa-
sion Mark was left alone in the gallery, the
debate being prosy and commonplace, and
bis companions anxious to refiesh themselves.
'1 he simplest man in the corps was the first
to return, and to him Supple pretended to
read from his note-book the substance of a de-
bate which be said had taken phue on the Irish
potatoe, and in whiih he alleged that \\ ilber-
fbree had taken part. The poor gull swallowed
all Supple?s pretended report, and gave the
sutstaiue in his turn to the representatives of
(lie other papers. '1 he next morning?s
journals all contained the spurious
debate, with llie exception of the Chronicle
?Supple?s paper, and when the House met in
the evening, Mr. Wilberforce roseamidshouts
of laughter, and good-humouredly complained
of the farcical report. ? They have made
me say,? remarked he, ? that potatoes make
men healthy, vigorous, and active; hut what
is still more in their favor, they make
men tall; more especially was he led to say
so. as being rather under the common size,
and he must lament that his guardians had
not fostered him under this genial vegetable !?
Mr. Wilberforce could only quote the sentence
which had been fathered upon him, he and
the other members laughing so immoderately
that he was obliged to sit down. ?So much
for Mark Stipple and his practical joking.?
Among the ?Times? men there was one Mr.
Tvas, who was both a gentleman and a scho-
lar, and he once introduced nearly a page
of Cicero into a speech of Lord Brougham?s,
his lordship adopting the interpolation when
correcting his sped lies for Hansard. Hon.
members who fancied themselves orators used
to complain occasionally that their harangues
were not reported verbatim, but when one of
the newspapersattempted it,the very men who
bad complained thought themselves lampooned
and very few have ventured since to meddle
with the discretion of the reporters. In 1833,
O?Connell made an attack on the galleiy men
for what he conceived to be a neglect of his
merits, and be imputed dishonorable motives
to the transgressors. Peel defended the press
nobly, as did many others, and O?Connell was
punished in a way he little anticipated, for
the reporters asseverated that they would not
give him a liue until he had retracted his im


putatkm, and he was afterwards more just
towards the body. Anxious as he was to be
reported in the House, he was not quite so
wishful that all he said in his agitating tours
through Ireland should be made public, and
when the government once sent over some
shorthand wr ters to take down his speeches,
he defeated them at Kant ark by speaking in
the?Trish language.?The parliamentary Staff
of a daily newspaper numbers not less than
sixteen, and each man takes his half or three
quarter hour ?turn? with the precision and re-
gularity of clock-work.
The electric telegraph has p-oved an im-
mence assistance to the press, and of this we
had full proof on the arrival of the last mail
in the colony. It is a fact that the news
brought by a foreign mail steamer to South-
ampton is printed by the London papers in
second editions and sent back to that port by
rail before the packet reaches the wharf. When
Paredes, the Mexican leader, came over to
England incog, as he thought, he heard as he
stepped on shore, news-boys bawling out his
name and arrival as part .of the intelligence
just brought down by the London papers.
This is of course accomplished by the agency
of shipping reporters and the telegraph.
When important meetings?such as those of
Mr. Bright a short time ago?are held in the
provinces, the London dailies either club
together and send men down by express
engine, or else the speech is forwarded by the
wires as it is being spoken, reporters relieving
each o her at the telegraph office at short
intervals. The rapidity with which this pro-
cess is carried on seems almost incredible to
the uninitiated, and it is a surprising fact that
the speech of the King of the Belgians was
being set up in type in a London office while
he was yet speaking in the Brussels chambers ,
as was also the case with a late speech of Mr.
Bright at Birmingham. I trust that we shall,
not very long hence, read news in the Queens-
land papers 6 or 12 hours old from England,
and that we shall not be compelled much
longer to content ourselves with calling new
what is really three months old or more.
At length I come to the close of my remarks,
and as I do so 1 feel that I have done but
meagre justice to the subject, although I fear
I may have been wearisome to you. If I have
said anything that has appeared over-
strained or highflown, I must beg of you to
put it down to the credit of professional zeal;
although I shall not be free to admit that I
have over stated the importance of the press.
You are residents in the principal town of a
new colony, and as things progress, and
matters are developed, you may often have
cause to rejoice in the freedom of your press,
if you cannot palliate its indiscretions. Our
adopted land is destined, I hope, to rise up
into greatness as a prosperous and flourishing
colony long before the nineteenth century
draws near its closing, and we have the
examples of history to follow, the warnings of
history to avoid. We are in a position to profit
by the experiences of our neighbours, and 1 trust
that our newly-launched barque may find helms -
men who shall steer her clear of shoals and
quicksands, and rugged dangerous reefs. We
cannot doubt the importance ot the work before
us, nor can we think lightly of its responsibili-
ties, and I hope that the Fourth Estate may not
be found wanting. It is hardly to be expected
that, in settlements newly formed, the press
can so fully maintain the independent and
exalted tone which is the characteristic of
long-established journals in the home country,
or of journals that are, at their very birth,
thrown into circumstances that ensure suc-
cess. The world does not know the man who
has sufficient abnegation of self to maintain
an organ of public opinion purely for the pub-
lic good, and without profit to himself. The
proprietor of a newspaper has the bump of
acquisitiveness developed quite as prominently
as the squatter on his station, the merchant
in his warehouse, the land jobber in his of-
fice, the lawyer in his chambers, or the trades-
man in his store, and he?the newspaper
proprietor?is of course anxious that his pro-
perty should be remunerative. And can any
one find fault with him, or dispute his right
to seek a reward fcr his outlay and his pains?
Of course not, say you; then I would ask
you not to judge too harshly of your press.
It will be a glorious day for Queensland when
her journals can put on a thoroughly bold
and independent front, and?defiant of pre-
judice and heedless of pecuniary consequences
?express their views and convictions honestly
and unreservedly, neither fearing a frown, nor
courting a favor. I hope soon to see that
day?l hope soon to see this province emu-
lating the free states of the far west, and
multiplying its newspapers by scores?l hope
to see the press faithful to its high and noble
mission, actuated by the loftiest aims, and im-
pelled by the purest motives. Not a fetter
binds it?not a shackle encumbers its useful-
ness, and while any abuse of its freedom
must merit, and meet with, the sternest repro-
bation, ?1 do sincerely and devoutly hope
that that freedom may be maintained invio-
late, and that the press of Queensland may
ultimately assume a position of which even the
mother country might be proud, and which
time shall rather strengthen than destroy.

[Note. ? I have been accused, since the ap-
pearance of the first part of this lecture, with
having mis-stated the derivation of the word
? new.? I did nothing of the kind. I simply
gave the alleged derivation of the word ? news,??
as referring to newspapers, and, if 1 mistake not,
my authority was a writer in the pages of ? Notes
and Queries.? The party who takes me to task
ventures beyond his depth. He tells a story of
an individual who strove to prove that the word
? hypocrite ? was derived from two Greek words,
11 ippos and krites ? (sic). If my critic has a Greek
lexicon, and knows how to use it?a contingency
I very much doubt?he will find that he has mis-
spelt the first word, which should have been
hippos. The omission of a letter is a mere trifle, of
course, to ignorant people, and may be excused
in my critic, who, I shrewdly expect, hails from
Cockayne. I should have explained this matter
in the newspaper which attacked me, but did not
think it worth my while. I mention it here for
the benefit of those friends into whose hands this
pamphlet may fall.? T. P. P.]
