THIS pamphlet professes to give, no more
than a “ popular ” description of the Organ.
It is addressed rather to those who are un-
familiar with the details of the organ-byilder's
art than to those to whom they are already
known. All technicalities, therefore, have been
carefully avoided. It is hoped, however, that it
will be found to contain a faithful as well as
complete account of all essential features of the
instrument, and that their mode of presentation
and explanation will appear sufficiently lucid to
enable every reader to gain a clear idea of what
the organ really is, and what it contains and
comprises, together with a comprehensive under-
standing of the means by which its vast resources
are controlled by the organist.

THE GRAND ORGAN.
HE GRAND ORGAN, the
property of the City of
Sydney, and now located
in- its Centennial Hall,
is the largest, and, in some
respects, the most complete
musical instrument in the
whole world.
In a certain sense the
Organ must be accounted
the oldest of all musical instruments. The
ancient phorminx or lyra of the Greeks still
lives in the modern Harp. The Pianoforte is
another development of the same. But none of
these have much resemblance to the original
instrument. The like may be said of the
ancient kitharis, from which have been derived
the modern guitar and all the family of viols.
The modern organ, however, is closely akin to
that invented in Egypt some 2,200 years ago that,
despite all differences of detail, it may be con-
sidered substantially the same instrument. The
very earliest organ of which records are extant
comprised a series or rank of pipes of varying
lengths (tuned to the notes of the musical scale),
standing on end, and blown, from below,
through their “ foot ”or lower apperture. This
is still the fundamental principle of organ con-
struction. One by one improvements were made
with the object of giving the organist greater
facility of control over the sounding of the
pipes, and with each advance naturally came

the possibility of extending the size of the
instrument. Step by step its development pro-
ceeded until, at last, it has culminated in the
colossal Sydney organ, whose width is about 80
feet, height about 40 feet, and depth nearly 30
feet : wherein are the enormous number of
nearly nine thousand pipes all brought directly
within the control of a single player.
The organ of to-day, however, is not merely a
single musical instrument, it is in reality a com-
bination of several organs, each distinct, and
each complete, so far as it goes. An ordinary
church organ combines either two or three
organs, each with its own keyboard. This
monster instrument is a compound of five
separate organs, every one complete in itself,
although, as may naturally be surmised, so
arranged that any number of them may be
played together.
Before proceeding to a description of this
latest specimen of the organ-builder’s art, con-
structed by Hill and Son, of London, it will be
interesting to compare it with other large instru-
ments. The following is a list of ten famous
instruments—their comparative sizes being indb
cated by their number of “stops ” :
Alexandra Palace (London) 5 „ 8q „
Melbourne Town Hall ... 5 „ 66 ~
To organists the mere enumeration and
naming of the “ stops ” of an instrument suffice
4


to tell him all he requires to know about it. To
others, however, these matters have no signifi-
cance. Unfortunately there is no other means
by which an organ can be described, and there-
fore the main point of information needed by
the public is a clear understanding of what an
organ “ stop ” really is. Happily it is so easy of
explanation that a comprehensive idea of it can
be given without entering upon any troublesome
technicalities.
Primarily, a “stop” is, or represents, a com-
plete musical instrument , with at least one pipe
for every note of the keyboard or of its compass.
A violinist does not need a separate string for
every note he produces, because by firmly press-
ing a string upon the “ finger-board ” he can
reduce its sounding-length by any required
amount, and so can produce from three to four
“ octaves ”of notes from a single string. On
the pianoforte no such possibility of “ reducing ”
the lengths of the wires exists, hence a separate
wire must be furnished for every note of the
keyboard.
Similarly the flautist has the power to reduce
the sounding-length or his flute. Only when all
the holes are closed does the flute sound its full
length. When any hole is opened it has prac-
tically much the same effect as if the flute were
cut off at that point. According as the sound-
ing-length is shorter or longer, so the sound-
vibrations are correspondingly quicker or slower,
and (as we commonly say) so is the “ pitch ” of
the note higher or lower. By manipulation of
the keys which regulate the opening and closing
of the holes the flautist therefore can produce
many notes from his single pipe. But no such
means of altering the sounding-length of a tube
5


could be applied to an organ pipe, hence, again,
the organ must be provided with a separate pipe
for each note required to be sounded.
Organ pipes generally stand upright upon
their “ feet,” and the necessary wind for their
sounding is supplied from below.
Imagine, then, a complete series or “ rank ”
of organ pipes standing in a row, with the wind
supply duly provided.
If the wind were in direct comunication with
the pipes the natural result would be that all the
pipes would sound together.
The wind-reservoir or wind-chest is therefore
covered over, and each pipe stands in a hole of
its own, every hole being provided with a cap
or “pallet” (acting in much the same way as
the keys of a flute,) by which all are closed
unless operated upon by the player.
Each pallet is connected with the note of the
keyboard corresponding with the pitch of the
pipe standing above it, and hence the organist
at the keyboard has the power of controlling the
sounding of the pipes—simply by pressing the
“ key ” that opens the “ pallet,” and thus allow-
ing the wind to enter such pipe or pipes as he
desires to hear.
Every rank of pipes, therefore, represents a
complete musical instrument.
Let us now consider an organ comprising two
such ranks of pipes. It is here that the “stop,”
proper, first comes into use, and here that its
full understanding may be gained.
If each rank of pipes be required to be used
separately each must be furnished with a com-
plete keyboard and set of pallets of its own, or
otherwise, if both the pipes of equal pitch (and
there must now be two for every note) were
6


in direct communication with the same pallet,
both must sound together, unless some appliance
for “ stopping ” one or other be added.
To effect this nothing can be simpler or
more efficacious than the means ordinarily
employed. The two pipes are placed side by
side, one behind another. The pallet is made
large enough to cover the two holes at once,
or, what comes to the same thing, it opens
a single hole into a “ groove ” having two holes
on the upper side. Instead of the reservoir of
wind (or the groove) being covered with a single
board, three boards are used, all being pierced
with corresponding holes. The top and bottom
boards are securely fixed, while the middle one is
left free to slide to and fro .
It is easy to perceive that if the middle board
(or “ slide,” as it is called) be so set that its
holes correspond with those above and below ;
all the holes are necessarily open. On the
other hand, if that middle slide be shifted so
that its holes go where there are none above or
below, or (in other words) so that it interposes
an unpierced solid body between the holes in
the upper and lower boards, the result must be
that no through holes exist, and no wind can
reach the pipes whether the pallets be opened
or not.
Each rank of pipes being furnished with a
separate slide, and each slide connected with a
handle by which it can be manipulated from the
keyboard, it follows that the organist thus
acquires the power to “ stop ” either or both
ranks of pipes at will.
Hence every such handle becomes known as
a stop. And as each one governs a “ slide ”
controlling a whole rank of pipes, so each (as
7


has been said) represents a complete musical
instrument.
What is thus explained as being done with
two ranks of pipes is equally possible of ac-
complishment with any greater number. The
same principle must apply to the greater as to
the lesser number of ranks, and no bar to its
successful application to any number of “ stops ”
can exist save the purely mechanical difficulties
resultant from the necessarily increased size of
the working details and the greater distance from
the key-board at which some of the pipes must
be placed. In this Sydney Organ, its six key-
boards are thus, by “ stops ” enabled to control,
respectively, 28, 24, 20, 20, 8 and 26 (in all
126), distinct groups of pipes.
Pipes vary not only in length or height, but,
naturally, also in diameter. No one. for instance,
would expect to see a pipe of only an inch in
length as “ thick ” as one that towers to a height
of 30 feet The larger pipes necessarily oc-
cupy much more space than the width of their
corresponding keys on the clavier. This fact,
however, entails no serious trouble, as it only in-
volves the mechanical detail of a crooked instead
of a straight connection between key and pallet.
No attempt is made in an organ to place the
pipes directly over their keys. Experience has
proved, indeed, that it would be even inadvis-
able for pipes to stand in the order of the key-
board, as thus all the large “ bass ” pipes would
be on one side, while the small “ treble ” ones
would be on the other ; and as the large pipes
naturally require more wind than the small ones
there would be a “ lop-sided ” demand upon the
wind supply. The pipes in the interior of the
instrument are therefore placed by the organ-
8


builder wherever mechanical exigencies render
their position most desirable, while the few that
appear in the organ-front are set wherever the
designer of the case deems that they will present
the best appearance to the eye of the beholder.
The metal pipes in this organ vary in their
speaking length from nearly 32 feet (witness the
centre pipe in the Organ-case immediately over
the key-boards), to about § of an inch, and their
circumference from about 4-k feet to not much
more than £of an inch. The length of the
wooden pipes ranges downwards from 64 feet.
The total number of pipes of all classes in this
instrument is 8,756.
The several pipes governed by a single key
are not mere duplicates of one another, they
differ in power and quality or character of tone,
and even in pitch as well. The principle of the
“ stop ” slide is susceptible of almost unlimited
< practical application, and any number and
diversity of pipes can thus be connected with
any “ pallet ”or “groove.” Not only may such
pipes differ in pitch as well as quality, but ex-
perience has proved that it is even desirable that
they should. In the simultaneous sounding of
many pipes of equal pitch, one is liable to injure
the tone of another, unless some corrective
be applied. By combining with them one or
more pipes sounding an “ octave ” above, their
tones are found to be brightened, and still more
by the addition of other acute-toned pipes. On
the other hand excess of lightness can be
counterbalanced by the addition of pipes of a
graver tone, sounding an octave below the note
proper —the “ unison,” as it is called. Hence
(everything of the kind being rendered possible
by the “ slide ” or “ stop ” mechanism), every
9


key is supplied, not alone with pipes sounding
its own proper note, but also with others pitched
i, and 2, and 3 (and in some cases more),
octaves above, and 1 or even 2 octaves below
its normal sound.
Besides these, some (known to organists and
organ - builders as “ tierces,” “ quints,” or
“ twelfths,” and “ mixtures ”) actually sound
notes (irrespective of octaves) at intervals of a
third (major), and of a fifth from the keys that
are played. The use of these can only be un-
derstood by such as are familiar with acoustical
science, but their existence must be recognised
by all who desire to understand what a complete
organ comprises.
The actual compass of the organ is far greater
than that of any other musical instrument. That
of its keyboard, however, is less than even that
of the pianoforte, for while the latter extends
over 7or octaves (85 or 88 notes), that of the
organ has only, at the most, 61 notes, or 5
octaves. The lowest of the keys played by the
fingers represents (nominally), a sound no lower
than the fundamental tone of a violoncello, while
its highest note is but one octave above the high
Cof the soprano voice. For all that, however,
the compass of its tones extends over fully 11
octaves —3 octaves below and 3 above the key-
board, by virtue of the “ stop ” action rendering
possible to any keyboard the application of any
desired rank of pipes.
Naturally the greater number of stops, or those
of the greatest power of tone, are tuned to the
normal or “ unison ” pitch of the keys. As will
presently be seen in the case of one of these
“ organs ” containing 40 ranks of pipes, each
key governs 15 “unisons,” 4 of the octave


above, i of the second-octave above, and as
many as 17 ranks sounding (more or less softly)
other high notes; while, to counterbalance their
shrillness there are 2 that sound an octave below
the normal unison and 1 of even two octaves
below.
The organ - builder naturally delights to
triumph over mechanical difficulties, but his
chief pride is in producing artistic varieties of
tone-quality. It is essential, of course, that all
the pipes belonging to every particular rank
should be of absolutely uniform quality, and
that there should also be uniformity in their
strength or power of tone. On the other hand,
endeavour is made to give to each stop a dis-
tinctive tone-quality of its own, so that one shall
not be merely a double of another. To this end
some pipes are made of metal, and others of
wood, some are shaped round and others square,
or oblong, while some have a conical form,
&c., &c. In some the pipes are open at the top,
in others the top is closed (either entirely or
partially)—all sorts of devices being resorted to
for the purpose of obtaining diversity of timbre
or quality of tone.
In the orchestra there are “strings,” and
“reeds,” and “flutes,” and “brass.” In the
organ, endeavour is made to imitate all these,
in addition to those tone-qualities that belong
to the organ alone. The tone-qualities of the
various stops may be grouped according to the
following distinct classes; —Organ-toned, proper;
string-toned, flute-toned, reed-toned, and brass-
toned, beside some designed to add gravity to
combinations of stops and others whose purpose
is to lighten and brighten (by shrillness) the
tone quality of the stops with which they may
11


be combined—never being intended to be heard
themselves.
Organ-tone proper is characterised by fulness
and grandeur, without any “ fancy ” quality
liable to be associated with any other instrument.
The most important member of this family is
known by the name of “ Diapason ” (open).
A group of 4 stops of this class occur on the
“ great organ ” of this instrument. Their
nobility of tone could hardly be surpassed.
String-toned stops are modifications of the
diapasons, a crispness and pungency of tone
being aimed at, causing them to approximate as
closely as possible to the “ string ” instruments
of the orchestra. The chief stops of this class
are the “ Gamba,” “ Viol d’amour,” “ Sali-
cional,” and “Violoncello.”
Flute-toned stops hardly need description, as
their name tells their character. In no depart-
ment is the organ so successful in imitating the
orchestral instrument. In this organ there are
several stops of this kind whose tone is of wonder-
ful purity and sweetness.
[Certain slops bearing the designation of dia-
pason may be classed among the flutes].
Reed-tonea stops approximate very closely to
the tones of such as the “ Oboe,” “ Clarionet,”
and “ Bassoon,”of the orchestra. This organ con-
tains fine specimens of all these, beside others,
such as “Cor Anglais,” “Vox Humana,”
“ Corno di Bassetto, &c.”
[Certain of the string-toned stops come very
close in quality to the reeds—just as a note
from a violin will often partake of the w r ailing
pungency of the oboe-tone].
1 2


[Some of the reed stops also approach so near
to those of the next class that the line of de-
marcation is hardly appreciable].
Brass-toned stops need no definition, as they
fairly imitate the “Trumpet,” “Trombone,”
“ Tuba,” &c., of the orchestra. Many stops of
the above character occur in this organ, —the
tubas, blown by an exceedingly strong wind-
pressure, being especially fine.
It is hardly possible, in such a pamphlet as
this, to describe the tone characteristics of the
stops known to organists as “ mutation ” and
“ mixture ” stops; but as they are never heard
in isolation their individual tone qualities need
not be defined.
With such exceptions every stop named in the
following lists of the contents of the several
organs will be marked to shew to what class of
tone it belongs, “ Org” will indicate organ
tone ; “ Str .” string tone ; flute tone ;
“ Ed.” reed tone; and “ Br. n brass tone.
An approximate idea of the relative power of
each stop will also be shewn by such well-known
signs as ppp, pp, p, tnp , mf f ff, fff, which
graduate from extreme softness to extreme loud-
ness.
The pitch of every stop (save the “mixtures”)
will also appear against each, as well as the
number of ranks of pipes, and the total number
of pipes under the control of the stop-slide.

The great-organ pipes, for the most part, are
“ voiced ” to speak with considerable power,
none being such as would be considered really
soft. Loudness and softness, however, are rela-
tive rather than positive terms, and this has
been borne in mind in describing the several
“ organs ” which this instrument comprises.
This “ great ” organ very properly contains
but a small proportion of string and reed
qualities of tone, for it is intended for grave,
massive, noble, and stately uses, while “fancy”
effects are reserved for other places. It may be
14


that the comparatively large proportion of 24
out of its 40 ranks of pipes being of a high
pitch (while only 12 are unisons and only 4 are
grave-toned) will be found to produce excessive
brightness of tone at the expense of grandeur,
but there can be no doubt that its 2,428 pipes
contain ample material for the production of
superbly noble effects.

The special feature of
enclosure of all its pipes
the Swell-organ
within a “ box
“ muffling ” their tone. The front of the box is
composed of hinged “ shutters ” or “ louvres,”
connected with a pedal placed within reach of the
organist. By depressing this pedal the “ louvres ”


are gradually opened, thus causing the sound of
the pipes to “ swell ” out —hence the name.
This is the only means yet invented whereby
gradual crescendo and diminuendo effects can be
obtained, and as these are essential to what is
called “ expressive ” performance it follows that
the Swell organ is one of the most important
departments of the instrument.*
In its general tone the Swell-organ is consider-
ably less powerful than that of the Great (as
will be seen by comparison of the two specifi-
cations above) and it contains in particular some
stops of excessive delicacy and gentleness.

* In many modern organs the “swell” principle is applied to
groups of pipes controlled by other keyboards— sometimes even to
sometimes even to
some of the great organ stops. In the grand Chicago organ there
are as many as four swell departments, besides that of the swell-
organ proper.


The stops of the Choir-organ are still softer,
in general, than those of the Swell, and they are
also of lighter quality. This organ is used
chiefly for the purposes of accompaniment, and
for individual solo effects. It contains no
“ brass-toned ” stops, but has five “ reeds,”
which are enclosed in a swell-box for purposes
of expression.

The Solo-organ, as its name implies, is designed
for individual effects, and every one of its stops
may be used in isolation. Unlike most of the
kind, it is not enclosed in a swell-box, hence it
is devoid of any possibility of crescendo and
diminuendo. It is therefore, in certain ways,
less suitable for “ solo ” use than the Choir
organ. The three “Tubas,” blown by excep-
tionally high-pressure of wind, are the most
powerful stops in the whole organ.

The Echo organ is less available for real
“ echo ” effects than it would be if its stops
were enclosed in a swell-box, which not only
softens the tone, but also gives what is called
“ distance.” Certain of its stops, however, are
possessed of singular beauty of tone-quality,
being voiced with rare art.
Each of these organs is absolutely complete
in itself as an independent musical instrument.
Mechanical accessories, called “ Couplers,” are
provided whereby any two may be connected
so that, if necessary, each may be coupled with
each, thus enabling all five to be played from a
single key-board.
Supposing that were done, and all the
sounding stops drawn out, as many as 128 pipes
would sound for each note, so that an ordinary
eight-note chord would sound the enormous
number of 1,024 pipes !


The special feature of the organ, however, is
as yet unmentioned, namely : The Pedal
clavier and its uses. The organist does not
alone play with his two hands, but with both
feet also, a special key-board (under the seat)
being provided for that purpose.
Originally, doubtless, some enterprising player,
wishful of obtaining a special effect by intro-
ducing or sustaining a particular note, attempted
its accomplishment, perhaps by affixing a loop
of string to the desired key of the “ manual
clavier” (for we must now distinguish keyboards
as “ manual ” or “ pedal,” according as intended
for hand or feet), so that he might pull it down
by his foot when needed. In course of time,
however, this became a recognised feature of
organ playing, and a proper keyboard was added
to the instrument.
These “ pedal ” keys are, of course, of suitable
dimensions, so that the boot of the organist may
individualise the notes ; indeed the normal length
of the key is 27 inches, while the standard
distance between the centres of successive keys
is 2g inches. In the process of playing, both
“toes ” and “ heels ” are employed, the organist
thus having four points with which to press
down the keys. Speaking generally it may be
said that all the bass notes and passages in organ
music are played by the feet.
The pedal key board has a compass of 30
notes, a complete chromatic scale of 2f\ octaves,
having C as its lowest and F as its highest tones.
Its normal or unison pitch is ati octave below that
of the manual notes.
Upon this keyboard the organist has to play
passages of all kinds, not merely isolated notes
but “ runs,” “ arpeggios,” “ trills,” &c., &c., just


as with the hands. Strange though it may seem
to persons unfamiliar with organ playing, the
feet may be so cultivated that they can execute
passages with almost as great rapidity as the
fingers, and to accomplish this is the aim of
every good organist.
Organ music is written upon three “ staves,”
the upper two for the hands, as in pianoforte
music, and the bottom one for the feet. To all
practical intents the organist thus uses what
may be said to be equivalent to three hands.
The pedal keyboard controls an independent
organ, which, in the present case, comprises
as many as 26 stops, governing 32 ranks of
pipes. In the Sydney organ there are no less
than 4 ranks, whose lowest tone is generated by
a pipe of 32 feet in length, while it (and it
alone) also possesses one of the phenomenal
length of 64 feet.
Details of this organ are given on opposite
page.
“ Couplers ” are also provided, whereby the
keys of the pedal clavier may be made to
operate upon Great, or Swell, or Choir, or Solo,
or Echo keyboard, thus giving an ingenious
organist power to produce occasional effects as
if really possessed of three hands.
From the foregoing particulars it must be
evident that the mechanical details of an organ
must be of wonderful complexity, seeing that, as
in the present case, six independent organs
containing altogether 8,756 pipes are all brought
within the control of a single player.

In a small organ the “action ” connecting the
key with the pallet (and hence with the pipe)
jnay be very simple and direct; but in a large
instrument, where pipes are many yards distant
from the keyboard, much more extensive as well
as complicated “ action ” must be required.
Until recent years the key and pallet were con-
nected by long “ trackers ” of thin wood —turned
off at an angle, here, by an “elbow joint” or


“ square ” ; transferred to a distance, there, by a
“roller”; and so on, until, at length, by crooked
paths (to right or left, to above or below) the
pallet was reached. In some organs it would
hardly be an exaggeration to say that the trackers
must be many miles in length.
From the cumbersomeness of long trackers
and from the large size of the pallets (against
which the wind would act with almost violent
pressure) the “ touch ” of the keys became too
heavy for ordinary fingers to play upon. Various
devices were attempted and at length wind-
pressure was called upon to do the hard work.
The key became required to do no more than to
open a valve through which compressed air could
pass, and this “ weighted wind,” by acting upon
another valve, relieved the player of all strain by
itself undertaking the moving of all the trackers,
etc. Electricity was also sometimes employed;
and sometimes electrical and pneumatic actions
in combination.
Still the more or less clumsy trackers remained
until a new system (styled the “ tubular pneu-
matic ”) was invented. This is the system
employed in the present organ. Without detail-
ing the technical complexities of the system it
will suffice to say that all the key now has to do
is to open a pneumatic valve allowing a puff of
heavily-compressed air to enter. The resultant
energy of this “puff” of wind is straightway
transmitted along a tube (like a length of flexible
gas tubing) which communicates direct with the
pallet. This pneumatic action is almost instan-
taneous in effect, and it enables the “ touch ” of
the organ to be made as light and delicate as
that of the pianoforte.
The aid of pneumatics is also brought in to
22


give the organist facility of control over the stop
handles. Until very recent times the player had
no mechanical accessories to assist him in this
matter save a few “ combination pedals,” each
one arranged to draw out or in certain groups of
stops. In this organ, however, each manual
keyboard is supplied with a series of pneumatic
“ combination studs ” of ivory, arranged below
the keyboards in such positions that they may
be easily reached by the thumbs of the player,
if he be using that organ at the time, or by his
fingers, if he be playing upon the keyboard next
below. Each one governs a stop or group of
stops, and immediately on its being depressed the
corresponding pipes are brought into operation.
To give an idea of what perfect control these
combination movements give to the player, it is
only necessary to mention that by pressing the
right-hand (the Bth) of the pneumatic studs at-
tached to the “Great Organ” it is possible to
bring into action all the 40 ranks of pipes
belonging to that department, and at the same
open the 31 ranks of pedal-pipes that are de-
signed to form the fitting bass thereto. On the
other hand, pressure of another of those same
studs would “ reduce ” the instrument to three
soft flute-toned stops with a correspondingly
delicate pedal-bass !
The “Great” organ, here, has 8 of these
combination studs, in addition to 4 combination
pedals, each stud controlling (in due gradation)
certain groups of stops, while, at the will of the
performer, they can be made to operate at the
same time upon corresponding stops of the
“ pedal ” organ. Independently of these, the
pedal stops are provided with 6 controlling
pedals. Eight pneumatic studs are similarly
2 3


provided for the “ Swell ” organ; 7 for the
“Choir;” 7 more for the “Solo;” and 3 for
the “ Echo.”
The components of this grand organ may
now be summarized, as follows :
The Great organ has 28 stops controlling 40 ranks and 2,428 pipes
~ Swell ~ 24 ~ 31 ~ 1,891 ~
~ Choir ~ 20 „ 22 .., 1,342 ~
~ Solo ~ 20 ~ 20 ~ 1,220 ~
~ Solo ~ 20 „ 20 ~ 1,220
~ Echo ~ 8 „ 15 11 915
100 stops 128 ranks 7,796 pipes.
The Pedal organ has 26 stops controlling 32 ranks and 960 pipes.
Totals .. 126 stops; 160 ranks ; 8,756 pipes.
There are also 14 stop handles regulating
couplers, bringing their total to the enormous
number of 140.
The couplers are as follows
1 Great to Pedal. 8 Solo to Great.
2 Swell to ~ 9 Sole to its Bve.
3 Choir to „ io Choir to Great.
4 Solo to „ xi Swell to Choir.
5 Swell to Great. 12 Solo to ~
6 Swell to its Zve above. 13 Echo to Swell.
7 ~ ~ „ below. 14 Pedal stops to ‘ Great
pistons.
There are also 3 pedals controlling (both “in”
and “out”) Nos. i, 2, and 3 of the above
couplers.
The other combinational accessories are
8 snubs'* I t 0 Great organ stops.
8 ~ ~ Swell ~

and 6 pedals „ Pedal
The last-named 6 combination-pedals being
independent of and additional to the 8 studs
which, at the will of the performer (by drawing
No. 14 of the above couplers) operate upon the
Pedal as well as upon the Great stops.
24


Thus, in addition to the 126 handles or knobs
by which the player may (individually) select
and arrange the stops, he has also 14 other
handles, 33 studs and 13 pedals by means of
which he may (collectively) group together such
stops as he desires to use. Beside all these,
there are two pedals by which crescendo and
diminuendo effects may be given to the Swell
organ and to the reed-stops of the Choir organ,
while 2 more pedals operate upon mechanical
“ tremulants ” whereby wavy-pulsations of tone
are given to certain stops.
Supposing all the sounding stops were drawn,
so as to bring all the 128 ranks of manual and
the 32 of pedal pipes into operation, and all
the (unison) “ couplers ” also drawn so as to
connect all the keyboards with the “ Great ”
clavier, every note played thereon would sound
128 pipes, while each note played upon the
pedals would sound 160 pipes. Thus a chord
of 10 notes (say, 2 by the feet and 4 by
each hand) would bring about the simultaneous
sounding of no less than 1,344 pipes !
The relative positions of the several keyboards
and the stop-handles will be seen in the illustra-
tion on the next page, and the diagram following
will explain exactly how the keyboards and stop-
handles are disposed.
2 5


Under each of the five manual claviers (each
of which is specifically named) are the combina-
tion studs controlling its stops. On either side
of the keyboards are arranged the stop-handles,
64 on the left, and 76 on the right. These are
disposed in double rows, standing perpendicu-
larly, and as the stops named in the details of
the six “ organs ” were given in due order, the
precise position of each can be determined —
numbers 1 and 2 being always at the bottom of
the double row, and the highest numbers at the
top.

The true art of organ playing consists mainly
in the choice and the ready use of the stops.
Compared with this, even the difficulties of gaining
the requisite facility of playing with hands and
feet is almost nothing, and there are numbers
of executants whose command over the key-
board is practically perfect who never become
(in the best sense of the term) “ organists ”
who never, that is to say, attain to complete
mastery over all the resources of the instrument.

The true organist endeavours to give to every
musical phrase or passage the exact quality of
tone that is best adapted to its expression. He
has, as it were, to “ orchestrate ” the music just
as the orchestral composer or arranger has to
allot particular notes to particular instruments.
The organist’s task, however, is often the harder
to accomplish, for what the other musician
generally does methodically, where he can peace-
fully plan and determine the effects he desires
to produce, the organist has to do, frequently
with but little premeditation, at the moment of
actual performance.
These effects cannot be always written down
and adhered to as in the case of an orchestral
score, for organs have no fixed contents. In
hardly any town could there be found two
organs possessed of corresponding stops ! Hence
composers are often forced to leave tone-effects
to the taste of .individual players, and to the
chance resources of the organs on which they
happen to be played.
There can be no poverty of resource in an
instrument such as this, which possesses every
variety of tone-quality that can reasonably be
desired. Of course its 126 stops cannot all be
used together and yet independently, for this
would need 126 keyboards and more than as
many hands ! Its 6 keyboards, however, and
its many facilities for arranging and altering the
stops, give a wide possibility in the matter of
varied “ orchestration ” of the music played
thereon
It whuld be a grave error to suppose that the
increased size of an organ renders its manipula-
tion more difficult. Some persons might ima-
gine it to be more difficult to play a large organ,
28


such as this, with 6 keyboards, than an ordinary
small organ with only 2. On the contrary,
the more keyboards (within reach) there are the
more easy is it for the player to secure the effects
he desires to produce.
An ordinary church organ commonly has no
more than 2 “manuals” and from 15 to 25
stops, with perhaps no more than from 3 to 5
combinational accessories. On such an instru-
ment the organist can only “ prepare ” two
qualities of tone before commencing to play,
and he has but little chance of varying the stops
beyond what the few combination pedals con-
trol, while the 6 or 8 unison stops that pro-
bably are all the instrument possesses present
so little diversity of tone colour as to render it
a feat of enormous difficulty to produce really
good effects. Speaking generally, it may be
said the smaller the organ, the greater the
ingenuity and dexterity demanded of the player.
On this organ, the player can arrange 6
qualities of tone before he commences his per-
formance. The combination studs provide 33
more, and the combination pedals 10 extra.
The organist thus can command no less than 55
qualities and combinations of tone without
moving his hands away from the keyboards.
The real difficulty that the organist labours
under in respect of a large organ is a mental
one. To remember the exact names and quali-
ties and positions of 126 stops and the places
of the 66 mechanical accessories, as well as the
effect produced by each is certainly no easy task.
They are, however, arranged upon a systematic
basis known to almost every organist, and the
mental strain is much less than most persons
would probably imagine. From what has already
2 9


been said it must he evident to the reader that
this organ provides the player with so many
controlling facilities not possessed by ordinary
smaller instruments, that just as it was claimed
at the commencement of this pamphlet, that
the Grand Sydney Organ is the largest in the
world, so now, in conclusion, it may be under-
stood that it is one of the easiest upon which
to perform with good effect.
The formal opening of this grand instrument
by Mr. W. T. Best must be regarded as one of
the greatest events in the musical history of the
Colony. To no other person could the initial
performances have been so fitly entrusted, for
to Mr. Best —among organists—is conceded the
same position that the people of Sydney claim
for their organ, namely the greatest in the
world. For 35 years he has held the appoint-
ment of organist to St. George’s Hall, Liverpool
—and Liverpool must always be honoured as
the first Corporation that provided a public
organ and regular services of public organ re-
citals. No organist has done so much to
advance the instrument and its literature and
the general taste for organ performances. In
the first place it is mainly to his example and
precept that the development of true independent
or “ obbligato ” pedal-playing is owed. When
he began his public career this speciality of
organ playing was but little cultivated. He
himself attained perfection in the mastery of
the pedal and in its independent use. By his
public performances he has shewn practically
to what artistic uses it may be put. Still more,
by the thousands of pages of organ music he


has published, has he made known the art of
pedalling to organists generally. As a performer
he is unsurpassed, and his repertoire is, probably,

unapproachable, it being said that his pro-
grammes have contained not far from 5,000
different compositions.
In the original “ specification ” of the instru-
ment (dated April, 1885) it was stipulated that
the organ was to be completed “ in the Centen-
nial Hall by the 31st December, 1887,’' in
readiness for the Centenary celebrations. The

date was presently changed to March 1, 1888.
The building of the Hall, however, occupied a
longer period of time than wak expected, and its
formal opening was delayed until November 27,
of last year. The organ had arrived in Sydney
a few days prior to that date, and its erection
SYDNEY BURDEKIN, Esq, M.L.A., Mayor of Sydney.
(From a photograph by Chubb and Praeger,)
has occupied eight months. The instrument is
the property of the public of the Municipality
of Sydney—the present head of the Corporation
being Sydney Burdekin, Esq., M.L.A., who
was unanimously elected, last year, to the Mayor-
alty of the City.
