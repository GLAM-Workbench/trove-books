DEDICATION.
To THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD ROSMORE,
DEPUTY GRAND MASTER on THE LOYAL ORANGE
Insnzrunox or IRELAND; AND GRAND MASTER FOR
THE Comrrr MoNAGHAN.
MY Loan,-
When your lordship secured the distinction of an
expression of censure at thehands of England?s present Pre-
mier, you must necessarily have become more exalted than
hitherto, in the estimation of every loyal and honorable subject
of our Gracious Sovereign ; for any indication of displeasure
proceeding from an English prime minister, who could tempo-
rise with rebels against his Monarch and the Constitution ;
and pander to a Romish Pope, is eqivalent to the praise of all
whose praise is worth obtaining. The position, which you, My
Lord, have assumed in Ireland, is one of which any loyal man
might feel justly proud ; and the part which you have taken
in that priest-ridden, and, therefore, criminal land, has en-
deared Your Lordship to the hearts of all the Orangemen in
Australia, as well as elsewhere ; and the Brethren here feel
satis?ed that Your Lordship will un?inchingly maintain the
post you at present occupy ; and, with our glorious Institu-
tion to support you, stand ?rm and strong to oppose and hurl
back the encroachments of disloyalty, and Popery, the un-
godly root from which it springs.
My Lord, dark and desperate days are approaching for Ire-
land, and the Protestant people in that unhappy country,
rebellion is on the eve of awakingfrom its ?tful slumber, and
the huge and monstrous giant, Popery, is lifting his blood-
crowned head there once more; and should he be suffered to
regain his feet, multitudinous murder shall follow in his


wake ? The sole, or at all events, the paramount object
which the Romish Irish desire to gain, is supremacy for their
intolerant church, and the extirpation of Protestantism in
their native land. This object they arebent upon securing, or
at least attempting t6 secure" ; an'd?th'e bloody drama of 1641,
when one hundred and forty_,, ?thousand Protestants were
barbarously butchered, will be attempted ; and the horrors of
that sanguinary? period repeated. ' A short time will prove
the ?truth, of this s_tatemellt ; and when that terrible
calamity shall have occurred it may, most assuredly,
be laid to the charge .of England's Prime Minister,
The Right Hon. William Ewart Gladstone, for he. has done
more to create and foster disaffection and rebellion in Ireland,
than even Mr. Parnell and his rebelry colleagues ever did.
But, My Lord, it is not in Ireland alone that the regime of
Gladstone and Co. has produced evil fruit, India has felt
the blighting in?uence of their incompetence, or perhaps
treachery?; and Protestantism in that portion of the Empire
has received a blow, through them, which it shall feel for
many a day to ?come. When Mr.? Gladstone appointed the
pervert, Lord Ripon, as Viceroy of India he did so, doubt-
less, with the object of conciliating the Romish portion of the
Kingdom and his friend the Pope ; and when Lord Ripon
truckled to the natives he did so, we may be sure, in order to
prove how much more advantageous it would be to them,
to be goveroned by Papists than by Protestants. The
consequence is, that they now cry out, ? Give us a Ripon or
such as he, and no power can shake our allegiance to the
British Throne.? Thus Lord Ripon has gently smoothed
the path for the Romish missionary ; while he has
raised up mountains in the way of the Christian "teacher.
Jesuitism, My Lord, is indefatigably at work throughout
the British Empire, and those who are least suspected are its
sly and treacherous instruments. It is scheming and plotting
amongst us here in Austrailia, and we possess a Protestant
prelate who not only declines to whisper against Popery, but
absolutely declares that the Romish Church, before the Refor-
mation was the Church of Christ !! 1 Comment is needless.
We were also honouredly the presence of a. Govenor who
shirked the duty of reviewing our Volunteers one Easter Mon-


day, in order: that he might open a Popish bazaar in out
Exhibition building. You will perceive by this,? My Lord,
that Ireland is not the only portion of the Empire where the
Bomanists are patted? on the back and encouraged. The
simple truth is, My Lord, that the Protestants of the Empire
are imposed upon and duped by the -unprincipled and
clandestine minions of Rome. The religion for which our
ancestors fought and bled at the Boyne and Aughrim, was
never, since their time, in a more precarious and dangerous
position than now. Therefore, My Lord, labour incessantly
and do your utmost to extend our loyal and glorious Institu-
-tion throughout the Gladstone-blighted country of Ireland.
. But, My Lord, the Prime Minister of Englandis notthe only
wrong-doer in the British Cabinet. Lord Derby has- been doing
as much to shake and weaken loyalty in Australia, as his
chief has done to destroy it in Ireland. The blundering stu-
pidity displayed by His Lordship,.has disgusted every man of
sense and loyalty in these colonies; and there are many
amongst us who think that appeals, .rega'rding? annexation
or anything else, to the old country, are both unbecom-
ing and poltroonish on? the part of Australians. An in-
capable or despotic ministry, lost the American colonies
to England ; and an equally incapable and? more vicious one,
may do the same thing for England,w.ith respect to Australia.
Then perhaps, the ?grand old man? will be satis?ed and
duly appreciated by his mud-brained followers and dupes. My
Lord, there is one point to which I would beg to draw your
attention, and it is this. It is evident that Mr Gladstones?
sympathies are with the disa?ected portion of the Irish com-
munity, for if they were not, the ? Kilmainham Treaty? had
never been entered into by him, nor Your Lordship?s honored
name removed from the Commission of the Peace. It follows,
then, thathis sympathies being with those enemies of our coun-
try, must be against the loyal and faithful Irish subjects,
of our Queen. This being the case, Your Lordship, and the
brethren at home, may rest assured that, if they, goaded by per-
secution and acts of brutal tyranny on the part of the rebel Irish,
appeal to arms, the Prime Minister will let slip the dogs of war,
and loyalty to the British crown will be rewarded by slaughter.
My Lord, whatever you and the brethren at home do, keep


the peace ; bide your time ; be on your guard ; do not strike
the ?rst blow, for that is the excuse which is waited for and
longed for too. The time is coming when the English people
will grow sick of the bungling of their ? grand old man? and
one of a less effeminate mind will supersede him, and do the
loyal people of Ireland justice, and the M disloyal, righteous
justice too. My Lord, Ido myself the honor of dedicating these
pages to Your Lordship with the single object of attesting
admiration of the fearless and manly manner in which you
have come forward on behalf of loyalty and simple justice in
my unhappy and distracted native land ;and, My Lord, when
I express. admiration of your conduct and of your un-
blemished character and reputation, I only give expression to
feelings, which, I am satis?ed, are experienced by every
Orangeman in Australia.
I have the honor to remain, My Lord,
Your Lordship?: most obedient servant and brother,
OLDBRIDGE TOWN.
MELBOURNE, Vrcronu,
May em, 1334


ADDRESS.
To THE MEMBERS on THE LOYAL ORANGE
INSTITUTION or AUSTRALIA, BUT MORE
ESPECIALLY TO THE BRETHREN IN VICTORIA.
BRETHREN,??
I do not re-publish the following rhymes on account
of poetic merit, ,for I know perfectly well that, from the
beginning to the end of the collection, there is not a verse
of true poetry to be found; I publish them simply for the
purpose of creating an opportunity to address a few sentences
to you; for, except through these pages or the Lodges,
I have no medium through which to reach you. I desire to
say a little about some matters to which I would respectfully
beg to draw your attention, but, above all, I wish to say a
little about the Church of Rome and Romanists; and if I
speak rather strongly of both, it is only what they deserve,
and, moreover, I think that every Protestant capable of ex-
posing, in any way, the fallacy of the former or the tactics of
the latter should do so, for the interests of his own religion
demand it. All human institutions are fallible, because all
humanity is so, and all such institutions are, therefore,
liable to err, and most of them, if not all, have erred
and gone wrong upon some occasion or other. None
of them, however, has erred so persistently did so con-
tinuously gone wrong as the church of Rome has. No
institution that the world has ever known has ever instigated
more a_nd_ greater crimes than she. has ;.no.institution that
lns ever a?licted mankind could, for a moment, be compared,
in iniquity, with her. Her existence is a blight on humanity.
aid the greater portion of her career has been a series of des-
perate and tremendous crimes, whilst most of her dogmas are
imply epitomes of appalling blasphemy. Look, for instance,


at Infallibility, Transubstantiation and Absolution, and what
are they? Insults to reason and horrible offences against God,
yet thousands and thousands of human beings have been
brutally tortured to death for 1 refusing to believe in the
monstrous absurdities ; and because we will not accept these
blasphemous dogmas of here, as gospel truths, we are doomed
to eternal suffering. We believe all that our merciful Saviour
has told us to believe, we believe in-?the Father, Son and
Holy Spirit ; in the power of the Son to save us ;
in redemption from sin by His death ; and that
ifiwe go, with a penitent and contrite heart, to Him, He will
in no wise cast us out : and that only through Him we can
approach the Father. We believe this, all that the Son has
commanded us to believe ; but because we can not believe that
a frail and vile sinner, like ourselves, is infallible, all our faith
and trust in the Saviour are in vain, and we never shall be-
hold the face of our Redeemer. 1 We are likewise asked to
believe or be forever lost,that a mortal, perhaps a lustful and
drunken one, or even a murderer, can regenerate the" Saviour
of mankind ; can put Him into the lips of an expiring sin-
ner, absolve all that sinner?s guilt, and send his spirit, shriven
and puri?ed, into the presence of ?Him, who alone, is its
Almighty" Judge, Pardoner or? Condemner, and who is to
judge, pardon or condemn the presumptuous mortal who has
blasphemously dared to presume to assume. or pretended to
assume; the awful and sublime ?prerogative of his own Omni-
potent Judgeand Creator. But look at the system of Indul-
gences; Could anything be more cruelly and monstrously
wicked ?- No brain but one inspired? by the 'arch-enemy of
the soul? could have invented? such a destroying iniquity. In-
dulgences have been bought, consequently sold; and so also
have the unfortunate ?purchasers. These indulgences are bad
investments, for?'the interest obtained, on? them? must be the
wrath? of God?, death and punishment. ? No human being can
give anotherp'ermis'sion to break. God?s ' commandments, Inti-
pardon? him for having done so. Tetzeltoolc the contract Tfer
?s"ellin?g?indnlge'nces in Germany,? and "made a handsome; thjing
o?ut'o?f theiniquitous business, He went aboiiirwith hiswares,
like?any.other?peddler,'and seldhis absolutions for the dead
to" the??li?ving*-' ?Know,? said? he, ~??tlia?t'- thei morn?ent=?<'th?�


money jingles in my chest, the soul ?ies out of Purgatory.?
The consequence was that he did a. ? roaring trade?; and any
priest who would go through Australia, on a similar mission,
even in the present day, would also do 9. ? roaring trade,? and
his customers too.
Semper eadem is the motto of the Romish-Church ; and
so far as her desire to secure supremacy is concerned, the
motto is appropriate, for she is, and has been, ? always the
same ?; and to maintain her supremacy she has caused the
butchery-of thousands upon thousands of human beings.
-That was in her halcyon days, when she brooded on'a sea of
martyr?s blood, while being lulled into sweet and blissful
repose by the unavailing shrieks of her high-souled victims,
writhing and shrivelling in the ?re and ?ame kindled by her
hell-inspired priests and brutal zealots. And this,-?Grreat
Father of Love and Mercy ! all this monstrous cruelty was done,
forsooth, for Thy greater glory and for that of Thy merciful
Son! The records of the butchery of the Albigenses, the
Waldenses, the Hussites, the Lollards, the Moriscoes, the
I-luguenots, and the Protestants in Ireland in 1641, not to
mention the slaughter in the reign of Bloody Queen Mary,
are still on the page of history to attest the facts of
Romish cruelty and� crime, but on no page is there
as much as a solitary word to be found expressive of the
Romish Church?s regret for the ?endish. atrocities instigated
by herself. . Romanists have the assurance to tell us that their
Church never instigated those crimes ; that she never insti-
gated any crime. I-n reply ,to this I will use no?wordsg of
my own, for I shall allow a Pope to - ?confound the ?Church?s
defenders. I give,-then, the following letter written by? P-ius
-7V. (who was canonized on account of his ?exertions a'gai'n_st
heresy'(?)?�) to Charles IX. of eFl��ance. ~ Thev Pope says�
9? We.pray Almighty God,�wl1o: is?the Lord ofvHosts . ; .
.2 -. . mercifully to grant your majesty the victory over
our common? enemies. a When God shall: have given, as? we
trust, the victory?-Ito your majesty, it willi then be for you to
punish, with �vigor, the heretics: an?d.?- their leaders, because
theyfare the -enemies? of God?, and you-must avenge on them;
not -your own injuries only, but the� injuries of Almighty
God.�??r Such? was the advice of the - Pope,'-a?nd- it pro?-


duced the desired effect. According to Romish belief the
Pope is infallible and can do no wrong. So when he coun-
selled the extermination of ?heretics and their leaders,? he
did a righteous act. As such an act was righteous at that
period, it would, of course, according to Romish belief, be
equally righteous now ; if then Leo XIII. offered similar
advice to-day, and that it were carried into complete effect,
he, in due time would, doubtless, receive canonization
and spiritual adoration, like his sanguinary predecessor ;
and the advice if given would be acted on. What
prevents it being given, and the Romanists of the present.
from following in the bloody footsteps of their inhuman
predecessors? Nothing whatever but thcir inability to do so,
for if they were su?iciently powerful they would begin the
annihilating work to-morrow, and regard it as one that led to
everlasting life and glory. This is the truth, and the Protes-
tant who believes otherwise is foolish indeed,? as so also is
he who believes that Ritualism is? not Romanism in disguise,
and the result of J esuitism in the Church of England. We
may be told that the Church of Rome would not now
persecute, even if it were completely in her power to do so. Are
not her people persecuting at this present moment and this too
in the very land in which we live? And are not renegades call-
ing themselves.? Protestants,? assisting in the infamous work?
Look at the Salvation Army, and, in the treatment which it
receives, behold an instance of Romish persecution. If there
were no Romanists amongst us, would there be a voice raised
against those well?-meaning people, who are striving to let the
reviving and invigorating light of religion stream in on the
sad, hard and corrupted hearts, hidden away in the dark,
and deadly dens of sin. and infamy, the abodes of a
hitherto unreached and distinct portion of society T No, if there
were no Romanists here, these Salvationists, whom may God
bless, guard and strengthen, would never be molested in the
performance of their high andholy labours. The decree has
gone forth from the Bornish authorities here that the Salvation
Army must, at any cost, be put down for it is drawing away too
many of the people from the Church of Errors, and, there-
fore, must be suppressed. This suppression will be accom.
plished in many and various ways, and Protestants will be


made instruments of, by which to secure the object. In
Hotham these Jesuitical persecutors have made a successful
move, and made it with the assistance of Protestants, or
nominal ones. The move to which I refer will be explained
by a paragraph from the Age of Tuesday the 4th of Decem-
ber 1883. It is as follows:-
The ordinary fortnightly meeting of the Hotham town council
was held last night, the chair being taken by the mayor (Cr. Pil-
kington.) After the usual routine business had been disposed of
it was resolved :?-? That no procession of persons or of vehicles,
or of both for other than funeral purposes, shall parade or pass
through any of the streets, unless with the previous consent in
writing of themayor, or in his absence, of the town clerk, and
only by the route speci?ed in such consent ; nor unless the
recipient of such consent shall have given at the least twenty-four
hours? notice in writing, with particulars of such consent and
route, to the o?icer in charge of the police station in Hotham.?
Thus it has been resolved by the town council of Hotham
composed of nine members, seven of whom are Protestants(?)
that no processions, save funerals shall pass through the streets
of that enlightened, town, borough or city whichever it is; and
the Salvation Army is ? scotched? in this jesuitical fashion.
Here is an instance of Romish intolerance and persecution, and
here we see how two Romanists circumvented seven Protes-
tants (?) who were, of course, quite regardless of both
? Catholic vote? and Catholic custom, and thought of secur-
ing only the peace and quiet of their genteel district. If the
Salvation Army were a mob of Romish rowdies would such a
resolution have been passed ?I No l for Messrs Fogarty and Pil-
kington would have declared it persecution, base and brutal,
and I strongly suspect that the seven Protestants 0) would
have been su?iciently obliging to agree in the opinion, in order,
of course, to prove their magnanimous liberality. In the
present instance they have attested their liberality by a toler-
sbly distinct exhibition of their illiberslity. This resolution
of the Hothaxn council? is a direct insult to the Protestants of
that district, and an infringement on their rights. as citizens
and ?British subjects, and if they submit to such treatment
theywill deserve worse which they will most assuredly yet
receive.


The resolution was the impudent work of cunning and in-
tolerant-Romanists, and was concocted simply to obstruct the
?righteous labours of our fellow Protestants, who compose the
Salvation Army in that district ; but shall this_ Jesuitism be
suifered to ?prevail in a Protestant community and must
British Protestantism fall prostrate before this brutal and
blood-stained tyrant called Romanism ? The fact is, if we
allow those Romanists their way in this matter, they will
ultimately object to Protestants singing hymns and psalms
in their own churches, and traitors, both lay and clerical,
calling themselves ? Protestants ? will be forthcoming to side
with them, on the grounds that such singing is ?likely to
provoke a. breach of the peace.? It is an act of infamous
tyranny to prevent any body of citizens from walking in
peaceable procession through the streets, while, to hinder them
from singing the praises of their Almighty Creator, and
teaching His word in the highways and byways of a Christian
city is repudiating the commandment given to us by Christ
Himself-. Wh-ether, then, shall we obey the Saviour of man-
kind or submit, like cravens, to the despotism of those
snpplicators of defunct mortality? If Rom/anists wished to
.walk in procession through the streets singing songs to the
?Virgin Mary, as they do in Romish, lands, and in Lower
-Canada, on Corpus Christi day, and that we prevented them,
What would they say ? Why that wewere bigoted tyrants and
-that they were persecuted. Intolerance, inany shape or form,
?is base and cowardly,,it is an admission pf, weakness, of error
or of guilt on the part of the intolerant. If opinions political,
-or religions, or of any kind, can bemaintained by only. brute
force and the physicalsuppression, or '-destruction of persons
entertaining opposite sentiments, the former opinions cannot
.be right or righteous.? i If the singing of a Protestant hymn,
-or? one of. the Psalmsof David can injure a Roman Catholic,
his ? blessed and... holy ? religionmust, after all, be a very...i.np

cause it is loyal to its God and to its ?Queen. If it were-
composed� of -a. horde ofdisloyal and zrebellious Land Leaguers,.
as the "over-whelmzingmajority of the Romish Irish are, it would
fare much better than it does ; be treated withthe most con-
siderate -attention and courtesy, while every favour which it
might ask would he granted with the utmost alacrity. One.
of the Melbourne papers stated uponone occasion,� that, -though?
Orangeism in the past had rendered ?good service in Ireland,
it was now out of date evenin that country, andaltogether out
of place here. Well, Ireland is, to-day, in a condition precisely
similar to that in which she was immediately prior. to the
periodwhen Orangeism proved a bene?cial power ?to the British
crown, and to Protestantism; and asfor being out of place
here, the assertion is foolish and preposterous. Orangeism
can never be out of place in -any country a?licted with Roman-
ism. Orangeism is the only power, under Providence, that
can frustrate the dark and deadly designs of the Jesuits..
If every Protestant in the British Empire were an Orangeman
the debasing and brutalizing in?uence of Romanism would be-
effectually checked and con?ned to the unfortunate people who
are its unreasoning and craven victims. The great mistake
which outside Protestants make with respect to Oran geism is,
that they accept, as correct, the character given of the Institution
by Roman Catholics. Thesepeople declare that Orangemen
are sworn to wade knee-deep in the blood? of Roman
Catholics. ' Now the human tongue never declared anything
more completely opposed to the truth. From the first step?
in Orangeism to the last, there is not. as - you are aware, as
much as a solitary syllable. to justify the utterance
of this statement of the Romanists ; but Vso far
from that, we are enjoined and commanded by our
rules to be courteous and tolerent to all men, no
matter what there creed may be. The only objects of
Orangemen are to mantain the Protestant religion, uphold
the British Constitution, ?defend and ?be loyal to the
Monarch, so long as the Monarch is loyal to Protestantism.
This is simply Orangeism, and if we are condemned for this,
the ersons who condemn us, can be neither Protestants nor
loyallmen. We do not desire nor wish to interfere with any
man on account of his religion or anything else ; but we are


perfectly well aware that the design of Rornanism is to obtain
complete supremacy, and then toextirpate Protestantism and
V all Protestants. We know that the Romish Church, and people
are panting to enact the bloody drama that she caused to be
enacted before, and knowing this we take the precaution
to guard against surprise. Does this precaution
merit censure? No, and if the ? Church? attempts to
carry out her designs to-morrow, we are ready for the tug-
of-war, and then we shall wade, not only ? knee-deep? in
Roman Catholic blood, but up to the topmost hair on the
crown of our heads, while shouting the old heroic cry of ? No
surrender.? I have said that through the instrumentality of
Papists we are persecuted, and so we are. Every other
fraternity is at liberty to walk in procession through the
streets of Melbourne, except the Salvation Army and our
Institution, whose very spirit is pure and steadfast loyalty,
yet? the privilege so freely granted to all, even to the Land
League sympathisers of St. Patrick?s Society, is denied to us.
By what perversion of reasoning and violation of simple
justice has this condition of affairs been produced? On
what grounds do our less protestant fellow Protestants with-
hold from Orangemen the privilege, or rather the right which
they allow rebelry Romanists to enjoy. The ?Catholic vote?
has created this injustice, and the mammon-mongers calling
themselves ? Protestants? have, for the sake of the same
vote, sided against us and disregarded our just demands.
Now, that? Catholic vote? must be overcome. The Protestant
clergymen of all denominations must come to our aid, they
must round up their ?ocks and drive the male members into
our Institution and enter it themselves too, and we shall then
form a phalanx against which the ?Catholic vote? will be
as the feather of a raven cast against a rock. We are
already a power in the land, our numbers are rapidly increas-
ing, lodges are opening up in every direction throughout the
colony, and with a little more energy on our part, we shall,
ere long, have the Protestant portion of the community in
such a perfect state of organisation, that the Orange vote,
and not the Catholic one, shall be master of the political
world. The great and good Bishop of Liverpool, the Right
Reverend Dr. Ryle, has told us that there is an organiza-


tion in ?existence for Romanising the Church of England.
This organization is composed of Jesuits, clerical and lay,
and Ritualism is the visible sign of their existence. This
Ritualism is the small end of the Popish wedge and day
by day the unholy mallet of Rome is driving this ?wedge
farther into the Established Church. The result
of this _must be the division of the Church, and
furious contention between the divided parts shall ensue,
the ritualistic portion will go over bodily to Rome, and the
Christian portion will be absorbed into the Non-Conformist
Churches, which, after a time will coalesce, and the true
Protestant Church will, by Divine grace, be thus formed. The
American Protestant Churches will follow the English example
and another great and glorious Protestant Church will rise
into existance on that magni?cient Continent. The same
thing will occur in Canada, in India, Australasia, and in all
the British possessions, and all these churches, all the Protes-
tant Churches throughout the world, shall unite, and thus the
true Catholic or Universal Church of Christ shall be formed,
and its Supreme Head will have its abiding place in the
country sancti?ed by the birth of the Saviour, (the Holy Land).
Events are occuring which will tend to bring this glorious
consummation about. The Egyptian question has a deeper
signi?cance than is generally supposed.
The labours of the Romish Apostasy to break up the
Church of Christ in England and elsewhere will, as I have
stated, partially succeed, but that success will, by Divine
in?uence, be the means of the ultimate and utter destruction
of Romanism; for the interference of God in events to come,
shall be so distinctly visible, that it will fall? as a holy light on
the eyes veiled in the darkness of Popish superstition, and
enable them to see that the Romish Apostasy really is, the
False Prophet of Christendom, themisleader of the soul, the
arch-rebel against God, and the perpetual cruoi?er of Christ.
Before the fall of Rome, however, she and her dupes will make
one supreme effort to regain her former position and a religious
war will rage throughout Christendom. Shocking and appalling
atrocities will be perpetrated on the Protestants, and the
enormities of St. Bartholimew?s daywill sink into utter insign?-
cance in comparison with the stupendous horrors which shall


yet be done. When Roman Catholics, to injure our Institu-
tion, say that we are swoitnto wade knee-deep in their blood,
they are simply measuring our -corn in their own bushel, and-
attribute their own design to us. We must be perpetually
one our guard against them and curb them by every
righteous means. within our power.; They boycott Protest-
ants .wherever and whenever they can, and push
forward each other upon every possible occasion. while
sordid knaves, calling themselves ? Protestants,? aid them.
Nowvthis must be -put ?a stop to. The boycotter must be
boycotted, the engineer hoist with his own petard, he can
not object to this, he has employed a system of tactics against
us which we shall adopt and use against himself, and, if we
beat him, we shall have done so through his own instruction,
and with the weapon by which he meant to conquer us. We
Protestants must give our patronage and support to those
people only who are Protestants in more than name, we
must leave the Roman Catholics to themselves and the Pro-
testant vote must in every instance go to a Protestant. Let
them return their co-religionist wherever and whenever they
can, but let no Protestant assist them to do so. In a word let
them look after their own, and let us do the same with ours.
If, then, the Romanists ?ndthemselves excluded they have
only themselves to thank. Whenever they were allowed the
management of public affairs, they took a corrupt and dis-
honest advantage of the opportunity, and, instead of dealing
fairly by all, they made the welfare of the majority a secon-
dary consideration and altogether subservient to the interests
of themselves.
Remember, that when you put the Roman Catholics into
power, you place the country under the cloven hoof of the
Romish Church, and you might just as well hand the Govern-
ment over at once to Dr. Goold and his priests. What was
Sir Bryan O?Loghlen but the merest puppet in the hands of his
clergy? Every Romanist that gets into power will be the
same, and every Popish member of a ? certain place? is
nothing more, nothing but the cringing slave of the priest,
who, according to their belief, can send him to either heaven
or to hell, and, so far as the latter is concerned, the belief is,
I fear, in too many cases correct. English fair play is al


very well, but Romish foul play must be put a stop to-?it is
the curse of the Old World and of America too, but the
blighting affliction must not be suffered to� blast this fair land
of ours. Now, my brethren, there are a few facts to which I
beg, with great respect, to draw your attention and especially
that of our respected and Right Worshipful Grand? Master.
The ?rst fact is, that Mr. Service, whom the Age, upon one
occasion called a ?Scotch Jesuit,? ? snubbed? our Institution
by the refusal to interfere with the Parties Processions Act.
The second is that he rati?ed all the appointments made
by the Government of the priest-ridden O?Loghlen ; and the
third fact is that Mr. Graham Berry is already placating the
Romanists by slyly dropping them into ?billets ? in the Post
Office, this, of course, is done with a keen eye to the Catholic
vote, in the future. So much for candidates? promises. When
another election occurs you will, I trust, remember these facts
and reward their authors accordingly.
v There is another matter characteristic of the Roman
Catholics. to which I beg to direct your attention and that of
all other Protestants. It is this. Whenever a Protestant goes
over to Romanism he is received with open arms and his for-
tune is made, but on the contrary when a Roman Catholic with-
draws from the Romish community he is maligned, and,
in every possible way, tormented and persecuted, and if he
dies and leaves a family behind him they too are pursued by
the enmity and persecution in?icted upon the parent. This
is undeniable and I shall yet give an instance to prove dis-_
ti-nctly the truth of what I write. Why do Protestants su?er
this iniquity to be done. Is it not su?icient to deter any man
with a family from leaving the Romish Church, no matter how
?rmly convinced he may be of its spuriousness? I assert that
every man who leaves that Apostasy should be received by
Protestants with heart-felt welcome and thankfulness to God,
and the protecting hand of every Protestant should be
stretchedzforth to aid and defend both him and his. Look at the
manner in which the Romish Irish here have acted towards
those perverts who are now among them, see what they have done
for Messrs. Brownless, Archer, the Winters, Greenlaw, War-
dell and others. All those conscientious gentlemen plunged into
Romanism and ?oated away on the full tide of prosperity, but,


of course, they would have made the same plunge, although
it might have sent them struggling down the uncomfortable
stream of adversity. It is true that Messrs. Archer and
Wardell have experienced a slight reverse of fortune, but
there was a desperate effort made to restore the former gentle-
man to an easy chair in the public service in the Public
Library. This e?ort was, however, vain, so far as Archer
was concerned, but Dr. Bride, a holy Romanist, and a man of
most miserably mediocre intellect, and possessing no special
quali?cation was put into the position. The Chancellorship of
the University is a prize which the Romanists are bent upon se-
curing for Dr. Brownless, and if they succeed in seizing it, all I
can say is that both they and the doctor will richly deserve to
get it, and the Protestants to loose it. It is all very well to prate
about liberality, but when men sacri?ce religious principle to
prove their liberality I am strongly disposed to believe that
their religious principle is rather microscopic in its-propor-
tions, and many will share this belief if the Protestants of
the University ever place a Brownless in the chair,
graced by a Stawell. Let the Roman Catholics get
possession of the educational institutions of the colony
and then you may hand them over the keys of the Protestant
Churches, and begin to prepare your little daughters for
confession and instruction in Peter Den?s Theology. Now,
it may be asked why I write thus against Romanists and
their Church, and to this I answer, that I want to expose
both, and to caution my fellow-Protestants against them, and
it is my determination to continue to do so as long as I live.
This pamphlet may be regarded as my ?rst shot at the
Romish target, but in a short time I shall take another at
the same object, when I hope I shall make a ? bull's eye,?
and this I think I shall do, if a Pope?s bull has any eye at
all. And now, my brethren. I have said all that I intend to
say, in this place, but before very long I shall come before
you again, and if I have written strongly here against Popery
and ? a numerous class of our fellow-colonists of a different
creed,? all I can say is that both the former and the latter
deserve it all, and a great deal more, which they shall soon
receive from,-?Fraternally yours,
OLDBRIDGE TOWN.

UANTIGLES FUR UUNVENTIDNERS.
THE SPALPEEN ?CONVINTION.?
These verses were written at the time that the recent Irish
convention was held in Melbourne. '
Let us all have a laugh, for there?s nothing like joy,
A right jolly laugh at the spalpeen Convmtion,
Each member of which was the broth of a boy,
And the whole purty thing was old Sata.n?s invintion.
Was there ever beheld such a. meeting before,
Or behind, or elsewhere since Jack Cade blew his
bellows ;
Thy bogtrotting element Erin asthore, '
Constituted the cream of this nest of ? odd fellows.?
There was Dr. o?Dol.erty larger than life,
And never a bouchal that ? polished a himper,?
In the hay-making season when buttermilk?s rife,
Ever uttered a mightier lump of a thumper.
He said that the Papists were boycotted here,
And sure after that there?s no use in denying
The forty-eight patriot has not a peer
In fable or ?ction, or downright hard lying.
When here they?re as free as the air that they breathe,
Enjoying each privilege sanctioned by reason ;
Although we?re aware in their bosoms there seetheth,
The elements, doctor, of double-dyed treason. ?
But who could expect to hear truth in a crowd,
So motly and grim from their underground working ;
There truth was but whispered, nor whispered aloud,
Because in its centre high treason was lurking.


Oh I-we?re up to your scheming and dodgery. boys ;
We knqw that you?re marching, though sottly you?re
creeping ; , 7 .
But though you continue your march with less noise, ?
You?ll not catch the Orangemen drowsy or sleeping.
You?ll not cut our throats in the dark as you did,
At the Diamond of old where you slew us like cattle -,
We know that you?re weaponed??your dynamite?s hid,
But we?ll not be quite unprepared for the battle.
In the North and the South, in the West and the East,
We know the papistical Celt is pursuing
The heretic-hating advice of the priest,
And that likewise rebellion is there surely brewing.
We know what your public conventions express,
To which both the English and Scotch may be hidden ;
But our stupid maligners will wonder, I guess,
When they ?nd what those public conventions had hidden.
We know all about your ensanguined Land League,
We?re able to follow its rami?cations ; A
Anti iihew very well how they plot and intrigue, v
With the Jesuit band in the ? Catholic ? nations.
We know how you're organised here and elsewhere,
How your Jesuit pimps on the Protestant Fapers ;
Hie Gooldward with news from the ?heretic air,?
to some other saint of the sancti?ed tapers.
We know all you?re ways, and they're ?erce, foul, and
mean,
So we?re up to the nice little game you are plotting ;
But open the ball, and by Jove you'll have seen
That our guns, while you planned, we?ve been carefully
shottin�.
One blow for green Erin, for Erin one blow,
When England with foemen and battle is cumbered,
One blow for green Erin on England her foe,
Till the land of the Saxon with Saxons is lumbered.?


One blow for the wrongs that we've suffered of yore,
One blow on the tyrant by whom we're yet spit on,
One charge to the fetlock in Sassanch gore,
Then a dance of delight on the grafre of the Briton.?
Then up with the cross-keyed, black banner of Rome,
Aloft with the ? Sunburst ? it proudly shall ?utter ;
While the lips of the Protestant, white in death-foam,
No blasphemous prayer to the Saviour shall utter.?
And these are the sentiments patriot Pat
Conceals in his bosom and fondly broods over,
And the heart of the Paddy that would not do that,
The patriot Pat would stamp under the clover.
But let us go back to the dynamite nest,
To the meeting just held in the hall of St. Paddy,
Where there was not 9. hotgchal, it must he confessed:
That could gladden the heari of his mammy or daddy.
But stop, there was Longmore, the grinner who grins,
While ? invinting a coal mine,? by which to amaze us,
Or smiles while he?s putting an end to all sins
By hunting the Protestarit clergy to blazes.
But where was Fitzgerald, the high priest of beer ?
Pray tells us old Nick whats the duece were you doing,
That you shirked the Qonvintion and did not appear-
? Oh, it would not conduce to the pro?ts of brewing.?
And where were the sons of the beggerman Knight
The ?patriot poet ? whose muse was distilling
High treason in Erin to make rebel?s ?tight ?
Till he came here to ?nger the ? Saxon 'swine?s? shilling.?
Oh ! where were the sons of this worthiest Celt?
That's a. thought which forever will haunt. and distract
us ;
Can patriotism like Du?fs then vanish and melt
When the moment arrives for the action or practice.
But where were the really respectable men
Of Celtic proclivities, men no way scrubbish ;


There wag not one present, not one of those when
()?Doherty soft-soaped the rebelry rubbish.
But stay my gay muse, we?ve enough of the clique
Enough or too much of the ? Spalpeen Convintion,?
For it?s really, and now ?tis the truth that I speak,
It is really not worthy a loyal man?s mention. ?
* This elegant expression was applied to the English by Mr.
Charles Gavan Duffy before the ? Saxon Swine ? hung a. bauble,
in the shape of a Knighthood, to his nose. The following is the
verse from the ? Muster of the North,? in which the words
occur :
? Joy ! joy ! the day has come at last, the day of hope and
pride
And see !,our crackling bon?res light old Bann?s rejoicing
tide
And glailsome bell, and.bugle-horn from Newry?s captured
Towers, '
Hark! how they tell the Saxon Swine, this land is ours ! IS
01133 !?
SOFT SAWDERING THE CELT.
The following verses are supposed to be addressed by
one Patriot to another hailing from Clare :
Dear Bryan, I don't mean to ?atter you now
For the best of good reasons I do not know how,
But allow me to say that I wish you much joy,
And likewise declare you?re the broth of a boy.
But if I-mayn?t ?atter yourself my brave son,
I?m free to declare what your father?s have done,
And how, in the past, they were monarchs somewhere
In that beautiful region now called ? County Clare.?
Dear Bryan, your ancestors wore a goold crown,
And the nation was ?lled with their glorious renown,
And they fed from goold platters and drank from goold
mugs, * V %
And they lay in down beds smothered up in down rugs.


And kings were as plentiful then in our land
As haws on the bushes, or shells on the strand,
And wherever you strayed you would meet, it is said,
A foin Irish king with a crown on his head.
And moreover, dear Bryan, each purty colleen
Was a princess complate and her mother a queen,
And the humblest gorsoon that tripped o?er the sward,
Was a duke, or a marquis, or some sort of lord.
And Bryan, avick ! when they met at a fair,
�Twas sceptres they leathered each other with there,
And their crowns ?ew about thick as bees out of hives,?
And they murdered each other with goold handled knives?
0, Bryan, avick ! it is, that was the time
When murder was only an elegant crime,
And a fellow might wallop his enemy till
The walloped and wallopper both had their ?ll.
But Bryan, each gorsoon that was not a king
Was beyond all comparing a much better thing--
A much better thing, without blemish or taint,
Bekayse do you see he was some kind of saint !
And so while the kings would be busy at slaying,
Those holy gorsoons were as busy at praying;
And so the green Island, especially Clare, '
Was equally famous for slaughter and pray?r.
And, Bryan, these pray?rs must have been the right sort,
For they seemed to increase the brave national sport
That was play?d at all times, and in all sort of weather:
So the saints and the soldiers did duty together.
* If we remember correctly, it is recorded in the annals of
Ireland by the Four Masters, that as many an two hundred
princes were killed in one battle. Judging from this we miiht
reasonably suppose that in Ireland, of old, every man was in
own king and his own only subject.


0, Bryan, ?twas them were the grandest of days,
But our country still shines in the light of; their rays,
And the ?base brutal Saxon,? while Erin?s leaf grows
Shall ne?er cast a shadow or cloud over those.
But Bryan, avick, shure these regal times ?ed,
When our ? Island of Saints? felt the base Saxon?s tread
For he came, so he said, for to make you polite,
And prevent you from ?ghting and getting too tight.
The dirty spalpeen, arrah, Bryan, just think,
To stop your divarshin at slaughter and drink :
The Protestant blackguard, just fancy again,
To teach what was righteous to Catholic men!
And Bryan, avick, he has trampled our land '
For hundred?s of ymrs, and from strand unto strand,
He thought he could civilize all that he met ;
But, thanks toyyour church, you?re not civilized yet.
And the moment you are then your luckwill be cross?d,
And, Bryan?, avick, you?]l be ruined and lost ;
Then don?t give the Saxon the ghost of a chance
To make you, what he would describe as ? Advance.?
But, Bryan, I?ll tell you the course you?ll pursue :
Just give him politely the toe of your shoe ;
But if you consider that plan too polite,
Let him have the sharp dirk or the sure dynamite.
But caution?s the word, let your deeds be in stealth,
For that is the way to preserve your own health,
As you can?t put him down, as it were, by wholesale,
You must only accomplish the work in detail.
Now, Bryan, my son, I have said all I need,
And so, in conclusion, I?ll wish you God speed ;
And though the base Saxon may yabber and frown,
Here?s a speedy downfall-to his Queen and her crown.


PAT AND JOHN.
PAT.
DEDICATED TO THE MEMBERS OF THE LATE IRISH
CONVEN-
TION HELD IN MELBOURNE.
When Erin is free,
And the Saxon is cow?d,
?'.[?is then we shall see,
A right noble crowd
In El-in?s green isle.
Oh I won?t it be grand
To see freedom?s smile
Spreading over the land,
Parnell shall be king, A
And Redmond premier ;
And each gorsoon shall spring
Up a. knight or a peer,
And dukes shall abound,
Like haws in the ditch,
And all shall be found
Surprisingly rich.
And ladies of rank
Shall milk in th�?eld,
Or work on the bank
When tui�f?s being ? creeled.?'
Our ships, in galore,
Shall sail on the ? say,?
And soldiers on shore
Shall serve without pay ;
Because for mere sake
Of Erin so ?ne.
To ?ghting they'll take,
And rewarding decline.
The priests will say pray?r
Without asking for ? due.?'
For freedom so fair
Will su?ice them and do-
And doctors shall cure
The sick without pay,


And the barristers pure
Act in the same wav.
And each one shall bask
In the sun quite content,
And the landlord won?t ask
Any tenant for rent ;
?Or if he should do
That which he should not,
;My hand, John, to you
He?ll ?nd himself shot
Because we?ll not let
The ancient disgrace--.
.A fresh footing get??
To dishonour our race.
And dickens a thing,
'lt?s truth I tell you,
.Shall noble or king,
Or any one do.
,So, without paying rent,
' And all other harsh fees,
We?d live quite content,
And as grand as grandees.
JOHN .
?What you say, my friend Pat,
Seems nice I allow,
But it?s all round guy hat
What you?re seeking just now.
You Irish are queer,
Half clod and half spark ;
?One moment you?re clear,
And another you're dark.
As fair as the day,
"When ?tis shiny and lzright,
Then foul, I must say,
As a. wild winter?e night.
I tell you ?no fable,
Yoti comical elves,


You never were able
' To govern yourselves ;
And if you began
To try it on now,
I tell you, old man,
That you wouldn't know how._
You?d bungle and botch,
?Well, It counsel you thus,
Go learn from the Scotch,
And pull peaceful with us.
For believe me old man,
You will ?nd that it?s best,
To follow that plan,
And let Parnell be bless?d.
If you had such a thing,
In your capital town
As an elegant king,
With his elegant crown,
Twould give you much joy,
But next you would claim,
My very dear boy ;
A church for the same.
When your state had a. king,
He?d be soon in the lurch,
Why not have that thing,
Which is called a ? State Church.?
And as the great mass
Of your people at home,
Are_ papists, alas ! _
Your state church would be Rome,
There?s joy in your dream,
. But freedom would fail,
If Rome were supreme
In the land of the Gael.
You ne?er had been slaves
So completely tjll then
And but in your graves
You?d ?nd freedom again.
Your nation's revenge
Is still strong in her breast,


And she?d strive to avenge
The wrongs we?ve redressed ;
She?d league with our foes,
She would stamp us to mud,
She would joy in our woes,
Ay, she?d lap up our blood.
Yes, if she got free
From our grasp, my friend Pat
Believe me, that she
Would strive for all that.
Now Paddy, my boy,
Give your rebel game up,
Or, instead of with joy,
With sorrow you?ll sup
The Empire, Pat,
Shan?E betfractiured by you,
An�l_nothing than that
Was ever more true.
Now go to your toil
And let national hate
At once cease to boil
In your heart and your pate
Or let it burst gut, _
And I'm ready fo bet
That, without any doubt,
It will ruin you yet.
LUTH ERIAN VERSES.
OLD MOTHER CHURCH.
Old Mother Church was a precious old dame,
Who said she was righteous and quite above blame,
And yet it was said by a. very bold wag,
That Old Mother Church was a shocking old hag.
But Old Mother Churchfonly cast ug her eyes,
And prayed for the very bold wag w o told lies,


And when she had prayed and shed tears like the rains,
She roasted the very bold wag for his pains.
But this wicked wag had a. brother who said
The same of Old Ma?am, so she chopped off his head ;
But another wag came and he called her hard names,
Then she prayed for his soul, and she grilled him in flames.
Still others continued to say she was bad,
Which made her feel mightily sorry and sad,
So she roasted them up just as fast as she eould,
Then she said?-? Ain?t I awfully pious and good 7?
? I think I?m a saint, or an angel, perhaps,
?Cause why, as you see I destroy these bold chaps,
As worships their Lord, or as says so,? says she,
? Instead of my saints and the Virgin and me.?
Then she called her man, Moloch, and ? Moloch ? she cried,
?Come fetch me 3. draught of the true crimson tide ;? *
So he ?lled up her cup to relieve her complaints,
Filled it up to the brim with the blood of the saints.
Then she gathered her scarlet simar round her hips,
And she lifted the cup to her hell-blistered lips,
Then she drained o? the cup, and she gave a lewd nod,
As she hickupped, ? I?m einless, and equal with God.?
? Nay, greater than God, for, though seeming absurd,
I can make or create Him, by simply my word ;
I can pardon all sins that perdition can nurse,
I can banish the spirit to hell with my curse.
And mortals, who, while on the earth went astray,
I change into gods, unto whom men must pray ;
And I force those same gods, by my power sublime,
To wring absolution from God for man?s crime.
And this I can do, though I can?t I am told? '
Can do, and will do, as I?ve done for some gold ;
Then give me but gold, and in spite of the Lord,
Ye shall gambol like lambs on the heaven?s bright sward.


Come, Moloch, more liquor, on carnage I?ll sup, W?
- i It 1 . I .1 1 ?I f V _V_ ___?7 _
There is holy delight in the depths of your cup ;
Fill it high with blood, blasphemy, horror and death,
These blended together will sweeten my breath.?
Fill it up, my bright angel, and don?t spill a drop, .
See the red glare of hell lights each bead on the top ;
Fill it up, for I?ll drink while I crimson earth?s sod,
Aye, I?ll quaff while I slay, and I?m greater than God.?
So he gave her his cup, full of horror_s and death,
And she drank, then she blew it abroad on her breath ;
And it fell on the people and glamored their sight,
Till she seemed, in their vision, an angel of light.
And, while she sat drinking, the Evil One spread
The sin of his majesty over her head, .
And lo I the great multitude, gaping round there,
Declared her a perfect expert at her pray?r.
Then she took up some wheat that grew out of a clod,
And she muttered o?er it, then said, ? Now that is God ;
At least it?s his ?esh, it sprung out of the mud,
And now I?ll produce you his genuine blood.?
Then she plucked o? some grapes from a vine growing near
And she squeezed out the juice, and she said, with a leer,
?I speak o?er this juice that you see ?owing out,
And now it?s the blood of the Saviour, no doubt.?
? So the body and blood of the Saviour I make ;
His blood I will drink and his body you?ll take,
And then we shall all, in a holy accord,
Have swallowed the body and blood of the Lord.?
? And now'that you?ve taken Him into your frames
Go sharpen your swords, and make ready the ?ames,
And every torture and deadly device
Prepare, and then act on my righteous advice.?
? Now up from your kneeling and praying and go
For my sake and the Lord's, cleanse the earth of your foe
Make your weapons grow red in the heretics? gore,
And the Virgin and Saviour shall love you the more.?


?? Let their quivering hearts be pierced through by your brands!
Let their hearthstones be blackened, and voiceless their lands!
Let them perish� from earth, all accursed and abhorr?d,
And be trampled to death for the sake of the Lord.?
Then the slaughter of God-loving Christians began,
Till the streams of the country in crimson tide ran, ?
And thousands and thousands were slaughtered away,
And the Church glories still in Bartholomew?s Day.
But old Mother Church, with hell?s glare round your head,
In spite of 'Bartholomew?s Day, we?re not dead ;
We are strong in our strength for our strength is the Lord,
And we?ll conquer you yet by the might of His word.
Behold us to-day o?er the face of the earth,
With songs of thanksgiving still hailing the birth,
The birthday of Him, Who, illumed by God?s grace,
Dragged the dark veil of Satan away from thy face.
Behold us to-day giving thanks to our God,
For that Brother?"??whose voice made you tremble and nod?
Whose voice still survives, and whose light shall be clear,
When thy tapers and glare shall be quenched on thy bier.
THE VICTIM OF THE CONFESSIONAL.
Old man, old man so bent and gray,
Why sit you by the river ?owing,
I see you here as day by day,
To labour in the town Pm going.
He gave a. childish smile and said.
?My neighbours say I?m weak and silly
Because I come and watch the bed
Where sleeps my bonny daughter Lily.
For where the river?s_silent tide,
Forever by its bahl;
It seems to me she loves to hide,
And will not answer to my weeping.
*Luther.


But people ?waked her up one day,
And, drew her gently from the river,
Then laid her in the sunny ray ?
That kissed her lids nor made them quiver,
And when they brought me to her, then
I saw her dripping yellow tresses
And kissed her lips again, again
But they were cold to my caresses
I whispered gently in her ear,
Then cried, ? Awake, awaken Lily,?
But still she slept and would not hear,
And ever since, they say I?m silly.
But ?well I recollect that day,
With all its migl_l_ty load of sorrow,
That never more v;ill'go away, ~
But seems increasing with each morrow.
I recollect I took her hand,
And fondled with the rigid ?ngers,
And ever since an icy band
Around my brain forever lingers.
It was her hand that bound it where
?Tis stronger far than iron?s power,
And while I knelt beside her there,
He came, who?d crushed my bosom?s ?ower.
And who was he 1 good master, hark !
The priest to whom she?d made confession,
He?d quenched her virtue?s sacred spark,
And lured her on to dark digression.
He touched me, and his hand was cold,
Then gave me coins, as if he?d bought her.
And then I laid his shining gold
Upon the bosom of my daughter.
And while? it glittered in the shine,
That o?er her placid face was creeping,


I said, ? Good priest, this gold of thine,
Is weak to wake her from her sleeping.
Restoreyour money to your purse,
And let it buy your chu~rch?s blessing,
But see the victim of the curse
Of guilt, that?s cradled in confessing,
Oh ! man of God, restore my child,
In all her innocence and beauty,
As once she was before de?led,
While bending at your knee in duty,?
He turned aside and moved away,
He could not bear to look on Lily,
And then I heard him speak and say.
?His grief has made the old man silly.?
I recollect no m_ore,_no more,
I only know I?vel lost my ciaughter,
But still I think this fancy o?er,
She?s hiding from me in the water.
So here I tarry till the eve, 1
Then, when the breeze is gently sighing,
I hear a voice that makes me grieve,
Because I know ?tis Lily crying.
I see the priest from time to time,
Oh ! fathers, daughters, wives, and ?mothers,
Can he, the man of mighty crime,
Absolve the lesser crime of others ??
A WARNING SONG-.
(After the style of Colonel Blacker?s soul-stirring ballad,
M ? Oliver?s Advice.?) .
Though England?s ?ag ?oats fair and free upon Australia?s
shores, M
There?s treason in our Very midst; there?s danger at our
doors; A


The banded host of bigot Rome now boycott and defy,
Yet p_ut your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
The shamrockcd sod of Inisfall grows red with martyr?s gore,
And hearts pant hot to see the same dread token on this
To 5:33;: 2? free and ?ashing sword? grow diln in slaughter?s
Yet Stisyour trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
Beho?dy-the carrion-bird of Rome, now brooding o?er her
nest,
And see the vulture-clutch which she now nurtures ?neathllel'
breast -
With murder in each villain soul, and vengeance swelling
high
Yet put yhur trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder dry.
Ay, see this Rome-bird how she broods?behold what she
' brings forth, '
Dread libels on humanity, grim horrors to the earth,
Unchristian?d blotches, sin-baptised, repulsive, bloody, sly,
Yet put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder dry.
And while ye look upon this bird of evil croalg and plume,
Remember, brother Protestants, the noble Saxon?s doom; (1)
The harbinger of peace smote down while on his mission
high, ?
Then _put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
Remember VVexford?s (2) bloody bridge, where murder was
the vogue,
And still remember ?forty-one,? (3) and blazing SQulla-
bogue ; (4) _ . . ' _
Hark ! from ?the stlll-upbraldmg past loud swells the martyr?s
? cry,
Yet put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry.


Remember Piedmont?s gory mounts where every sod was
red,
With Christian blood, and formed, alas, the slaughtered
martyr?s bed ; ? \
While through her Vales at dead of night the butchery still
Waxed high, --
Yet put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry.
Remember, oh l remember still Beziers of bloody fame,
And on your hearts be graven deep young Raymond?s (5)
glorious name,
Nor let it in oblivion sleep, such name should never die,
Still put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry. M
Remember Lyons and Rochelle, andphow the startled Rhone (6)
Grew crimson with the martyr?s blood, and vocal with their
groan ;
While black-'browed priests raged furiously, and mocked their
victim's cry, ?
Yet put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry.
Remember still the darkest scene that history ever knew,
Remember the gigantic crime of red Bartholomew ;
Ay, write 1t on your very souls, though it is writ on high,
Yet put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry.
Remember all the infamy, the torture and the crime,
That Rome, Supreme Apostasy, has scattered over time,
Go, read the records of her life, Writ down in murder?s dye,
Yet put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry. '
Remember all that she has caused of human woe and pain,
And that she?s gathering strength to act the bloody past
again ;
To act it ?neath Salvation?s sign that gems the Austral sky,
Then put your trust in God, my boys, but keep your powder
dry.


1. Lord Frederick Cavendish.
2. On the 20th June, 1798, 97 Protestants were piked, and
then drowned at Wexford Bridge.
3. On the 23rd of October, 1641, a terrible slaughter of Pro-
testants commenced in Ireland, and 140,000 innocent beings
were butchered for worshipping God instead of the Virgin Mary.
Why does the Melbourne Advocate never allude to this episode
of carnage in the history of the Romish Church, in the land of
very peculiar saints. The Advocate calls ?Liar? but never ex-
presses the truth when the truth tells against itself, which it in-
variably does, therefore the multitudinons atrocities and horrors
perpetrated by its Ohurh are never alluded to. V
4. On the 7th June, 1798, 199 Protestants were \ burned, am!
37 shot at Scullabogue, County Wexford.
5. Raymond, aged twenty-one years, Viscount of Beziers,
sounded the tocsin of war through his petty states, and arousedi
his vassals and friends to a deadly struggle. Castle after castle
fell, and heretics, poor and simple, or rich and? noble, were
burned in piles. The Crusaders?Romanists, were led by the-
terrible Simon de Montfort, a man formidable as a warrior, and
austere, fanatical, and cruel as a religious leader. The young
Raymond was thus menaced with dangers to which he coula?.
oppose only despairing bravery and the righteousness of his
cause.
The Crusadel?s?-Romanists, encamped before his capital, the
City of Beziers. He had made every possible provision, and de-
sired his people to ?ght to the last. The Romish bishop
treacherousrly offered the garrison their lives, on the part of the
imfamous abbot of Citeaux, if they delivered up the heretics that
were within the wall. ?Tell the legate,? said those gallant
men, who had to fear a death by famine, as well as by the sword,
? that rather than commit such a baseness, we would eat our
own children.? The city was taken, and all save one Ray-
mond, were either burned or put to the sword. Will the base
and craven scoundrels in Victoria and elsewhere, who cringe for
the unrighteous ?Catholic Vote ???-and sell their spiritual birth-
right for a. mess of Popish pottage in the shape of the mammom
of unrighteousness, read the life of this heroic young
French count, and endeavour to exalt -their moral facul-
ties, if they have any to exalt? In the history of heroism there
is nothing more beautiful and brilliant than his life. When,
after the siege of Beziers, he was defending Carcasson, terms
were offered to him to leave that place with twelve of his chosen
friends, he indignantly replied, ?Sooner than leave the least.�


of my people at his mercy (the abbot of Citeaux?s) I will be
?ayed alive.?? He was treacnerously taken afterwards, ?ung
into a dungeon, and subsequently poisoned by the minions of
Rome. How mighty is nobility of soul 1 Even these few words
relating to this heroic youth, will, I am satis?ed. exercise an
elevating in?uence upon their Protestant readers.
6. At Lyons, always eminent in the history of Christianity of
Protestantism, and of martyrdom, the massacres of the Huge-
nots were so great that the waters of the Rhone ran red with
blood; and at Arlee the inhabitants could not use the blood-
stained waters.?Hz'story qf Protestantism in France.
ARCHBISHOP VAUGHAN.
Died Worth over �60,000 1 R.I.P.
? It is easier for a. camel, &c., &c., &c.,
The pious Archbishop who vowed to endure
The pleasures of poverty while he lived here,
Departed with sixty odd thousand. that?s poor,
But then if it is, it is poverty queer.
How many great sins were forgiven for this?
How many indulgences did it secure ?
What license to interwed, tipple, and kiss,
Did this money obtain from the prelate so poor ?
Oh! dear, I should like to be high in that church,
That makes a rich harvest from criminalsand crime,
For then I should never be stuck in the lurch
For a. thousand or two, and I?d jog along prime.
Come, make me a bishop you sinners of earth.
Ay, make me a shepherd then you?ll be my sheep ;
And I?ll gladden your hearts till they cackle with mirth,
For I?ll pardon your sins and PM do the job cheap.
After all that is said against Mammon, we see
The Church ever ready with gold-siezing paw,
And the most precious son of her bosom is he
Who crams the most gold in her sancti?ed craw.


OUR FLAG IN SYDNEY.
Suggested by reading a telegram in the Age, that
Protestants attended at Exhibition Building in Sydney.
15,000
Fair ?oats the ?ag of glorious hue,
By Sydney?s beauteous bay,
And he�arts_bpth>loy_a_l, s_taunch and true
Are joyed by itsvdi�play.
As free as winds sweep o?el the foam
Where England?s war ship drifts,
It Ivlaves_above the ?eg of Rome
That Superstition lifts.
Ten thousand hands have hauled it high
Above old Sydney?s town,
And there in triumph it doth ?y
For none dare haul it down.
Then honor to each heart and hand
That raised it free and fair,
And God defend the glorious band
That guards our standard there.
HURRAH !
They?re dashing their skulls against the Wall,?
Hurrah my boys, hurrah my boys,
They?re dashing their skulls against the wall,
Hurrah my boys. hurrah.
Against the wall of Human Right,
And ?gainst the giant Truth they ?ght,
But he will smash their Popish might,
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.
In Spain Don Clootie drives them on,
Hurrah my boys, hurrah my boys,
In Spain Dnn Clootie drives them on,
Hurrah my boys, hurrah.
*'l?he Romish priests.


He?ll drive them to destruction fast,
The Pope and all his prelates mass?d,
And thus he?ll do some good at last,
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.
In Sydney, too, they?re driven hard, L
Hurrah my boys, hurrah my boys,
In Sydney too they?re driven hard,
Hurrah my boys, hurrah.
And Vaughan he may fume and blow,
And kiss old Leo?s nose or toe, '
But down the Romanish power must go,
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.
And here We?ll spurn the Popish sway,
Hurrah my boys, hurrah my boys, '
And here we?ll spurn the Popish sway,
Hurrah my boys, hurrah.
We?ll drive the priest-man from the school,
We?ll perch him on Repentance stool,
And smash the wily Jesuit?s rule,
Hurrah, lxurrah, hurrah.
A METAPHORICAL TRIBUTE
IN MEMORIAM '
THE REV. J. G. STOBBS,
Died 10th August. 1882.
? He is not dead ; but gone before.?
The labour of the? day is o?er,
i The shadowspf the eveningicreep_
Out from the night.?s approaciwing �hore,
And Day has closed its eye in� sleep.


The Toiler on the landscape dim, -
Moves forward to his rest and home ;
While bright and beautiful o?er him
The night-stars gem the cloudless dome,
In musing mood he wanders on,
His glance upon the star-gems cast ;
Till from the laboured ?eld he?s gone,
And reached the happy home at last.
But once again h�?ll come to toil,
With cheerful heart and anxious care,
lli�Ah<?e_l_-itage, and from the soil
He?ll r�ap the harvest full and fair.
And now the mom has come again,
The sun lights up the mount and lea. ;
The busy people work amain??
They labour on--but where is he ?
Yet_ in_a li_ttlp time they ceAase,
Afnd as_k fqr him whb?d led ?the throng,
And taught them truth and gave thenlf peace,
And loved them fervently and long.
They asked ; then like a silver bell,
A voice rose on the morning blast ;
? Labour, as he has taught; you, well?
He?s in the happy home at last.?
The crop he sowed upon the earth
Has ripened, not upon this sward,
But wheye the spizjit, ?nds new birth,
And there it is his rich reward ??
The silvery accents died away, V
And faces paled while tears were shed ;
For sorrow smote their hearts the day
That Stobbs was summoned from the dead.


THE CALL.
Why in sin will ye be sleeping ?
Why in it will you be found?
See I the light of grace is sweeping
From the cross where Christ was bound
VVaken from your guilty slumbers ;
Death?s dafk shzidows round ye falls,
And your every pulse he numbers ;
Waken then, the Savour calls.
Oh ! my brothers rouse and waken ;
Swiftly ?its life?s slowest breath ;
Be not in your sleep o?ertaken
By the silent step of Death.
Angel?s Watch to see ye waking
From the sleep which on ye falls.
Wake ! Salvation?s dawn is breaking,
Hark ! it is the Saviour calls;
Lo ! that glorious dawn is nearer,
_ And this _ho_me of bliss is thsre,
See ! its shining gates grow clearer
In the light that?s lit by prayer.
There the angel?s pinions sparkle :
There the Saviour?s footstep falls ;
There, there is no sin to darkle,
En?er now, the Saviour calls.?
IMPROMPTU.
Now let the name of Redmond go,
And be as those of dead men,
And, henceforth, let all people know
The Redmonds now as ? Red men?
Because the pleasant cause they plead
_ Of_elagger arjd of_' lea_d, imen _
On this 5139 point should be agreed,
To call the Redmonds, ? Red men."


But let all loyal people here,
Especially our head men,
Make this one fact completely clear,
?We don?t want Redmond, ? Red men?.
Andthat for our beloved Queen,
Our blood we?d freely shed, men
Are here Who?d soon make smithereen
Qf rebel-Redmond, ?Red men?.
A SQUIB FOR CONWAY.
He came o?er the sea, to instruct us a lot,
But lo ! his instruction is nothing but ? rot.? _
The dreariest drivel, the ?imsiest stulf
That ever a. freethinking journal could puff.
He?s strong upon Darwin, and Darwin we know,
Was strong on the monkey (or weak) and ergo,
The monkey admirer, Darwin the elf,
Was strong, rather hard, upon Conway himself.
We], let us just glance at the Darwinian creed,
And see how life came from an atom of seed,
All life from one atom that came from Somewhere,
From the moon, or a star, or an atom up there.
However, that point?s not worth mentioning, so,
The atom got here and began then to grow,
And after a little, some millions of years,
It grew into Something, as plainly appears.
And after another short period ?ew o?er,
That Something grew Something, and that Something
more,
'Then Something or other from Something was reared,
Till, somehow or other, the monkey appeared.
?So, somehow or other great J ocko arrived,
And somehow or other great J ocko got wived,
Then ? Somehow other,? said he on aday,
? By J ingo I?m monarch of all I survey.?


Then after a little the monkey one night
Awoke from his sleep in a terrible fright ;
For he saw by thg light of the moon, which then shone?
That his caudal appendage had mizzled and gon�.
Then he sprang out of bed, and he cried ? What a Guy ?l?
And he said to his Missus ? Pray, ma/am, What am I??
Then smilingly answered the monkey mama,
? You?re a man, and, my love you?ll be Oonway?s papa.?
Thus man came from monkey, tha.t?s plain, I declare,
And both from the atom, which came from somewhere,
And all this progression, you?ll see at a glance,
Came somehow or other by what we call ? Chance.?
For the God of the Universe could not make man
Except through the atom or monkey?ed plan ;
Though His will had created Suns, Earth, stars and moons,
He was forced to produce us through specks and baboons.
And still this progression progresses, alas !
And the son of the monkey trots into the ass ;
But if you should doubt me, and think I deceive,
Go listen to Conway and then you?ll believe.
And now that great hero, with assinine art,
Is seeking a god with a ?humanized heart,?
And if he can?t ?nd him while knocking about,
He?ll piously set to, and make him, no doubt.
And the name of that deity, Monarch or Judge
Shall be, ?tis appropriate, ? Mon-key-Cure Fudge,?
Then C. will invent, for inventing?s his trade,
A bible sublime for the god he?ll have made.
And Fudge shall possess a great- prophet, who?ll be,
The saint who created his own deity ;
And we'll all be most righteous, and perfect andbless?dL
With Conway?s religion aglow in the breast.
And sin shall evanish, and battle?s wild noise,
And at last we shall all become very good boys,
And with the new Bible, to church we?ll ell trudge,
To glorify Conway and Worship god-Fudge


A DISGIPLE OF CONWAY.
? Old man, old man, whence didst thou come ??
__l asked a_mz}n beside the Tarwin,
Then he replied ? From Monkeydoin ;
I was discovexfed there by Darwin.?
? I drink ! Ay often drink too much,
And then I feel a little drunky ;
And, getting a primeval touch,
I skip about and ape the monkey.?
? ?l?m fond of nuts, and, bet your cent,
I likewise like to pilfer money,
Which fact attests that my descent,
Is from the noble monkey, Sonney.?
? But now I?m old and feeble too ;
You see I?m in a very wan way,
What odds, I?ll tell you what I?ll do ;
I?ll go and get a god from Conway.?
? An easy one with human heart,
That won?t be overmuch exacting
With chaps like nle, or meanly smart,
On monkey habits of abstracting.?
? A god that will not be too great,
But will accommodate, you see, sir,
Himself to this old reprobate, V
Oh ! that?s the very god for me, sir.?
? Then cheer for Conway and his gods !
Awake the echoes with your laughter ;
We?ll all do as we like,\What odds,
His gods won?t punish us hereafter.?
No longer we shall be enticed
By virtue, for ?twill have no being,
For Conway?s gods shall strangle Christ
The Saviour?, and the great All-seeing.?
? The God whom prophets did adore ;
Whom Moses, when the Spirit ?lled him,


Heard on the Mountain, is no more,
The god of mighty Conway killed him.
? Then see the modern avatar,
A god from Conway?s brain� evolving.
To supersede the ?Morning Star,?
In Conway?s purer beams revolving.?
? Then cast aside all old restraints,
To moral promptings be oblivious ;
With Conway, paragon of saints,
We?ll be as monkeys, all lascivious.?
? So let the human heart run wild,
As tiger rushing through the jungle,
And let us teach each little child
That Christ?s rgligion is a bungle.?
? Then, though I'm old, I?ll now begin
A pew career, the best of all, sirA;
For Conway?s god won?t see my sin,
01', if he does, he?ll see it small, sir.?
Anady so h_is_pious d_itty ran,
Though lie was in in very wan way,
And it was then thatl began
To see how good is holy Conway.
THE GENIUS OF ERIN AND THE EXILE,
(A RHYME FOR THE REDMONDS AND ALL OTHER PARNELLITES.)
ARGUMENT.
[The Exile encountereth the Genius of Erin on the banks
of the Yarra. She singeth a doleful diity and lamenteth
muchly for the degeneracy of the Irish. She speaketh some
plain truths, and, having astonished the Exile?s weak nerves,
she disappeareth from his view, and, it is to be hoped, from
Australia too.]
The glittering monarch of the day
Had faded in the west,


Yet many a bright and golden ray
His recent reign confessed ;
But, intermixing as they spread,
Still higher up they rolled,
And formed above his ocean bed
A canopy of gold.
But all of earthly glory dies, V
The evening shades swept on,
And all the golden-painted skies,
Grew pictureless and wan,
Then pale and dim the landscape grew,
The evening breezes sighed ;
All things seemed sad, as ifthey knew
That gladdening day had died.
Then by the Ya.rra?s Willowed bank
I wandered, sad and lone,
The bitter cup of woe I?d drank,
And all my joys had ?own,
An exile from my native land,
From Erin, loved and fair.
With not a friend to clasp my hand.
I Walked in sorrow there.
But while I brooded over this
I heard a ma.iden?s voice,
That thrilled my grieving heart with bliss:
And made it to rejoice.
For I had heard it oft before, ?
In vanished happy hours,
When, on my distant, native shore,
I dwelt in blissful bowers.
But, as I listened to the strain,
My gladness changed to fears,
Her voice became as musicked pain,
VVllose sole response is tears.
I listened, while my grieving heart
V/Vas wrenched in every string,
Woe-stricken in its every part,
- And thus I heard her sing :


??There?s sorrow inlmy dwelling-place, where horror reigns
around,_ __ _ _
And over hapless Erin?s isle the fatal signs abound
Of cold and cruel murder, that shall linger and remain??
To tell, in future seasons, of dark Pa.rnell?s bloody reign.
*? The steel of the assassin now usurps the war-blade?s place,
And Irishmen now glory in dishonor and disgrace ;
Degenerate and unworthy of the heroes of the past,
'They?ve blotted out their title to a. manly name at last.?
? They bosist of many an Irish chief heroic, great and famed,
Vain boast _fl'om men whose infamy hath left their country
shamed ;
They boast of Brian and his son, of ? Nial of the Nine,?
~Of Mighty Art MacMurrogh, and the ? Princely Geraldine.?
? They boast the great O?Sullivan, whom thunder cannot
rouse.?
Ar}d__o't""t?f_{<'e?g_l'<_2at Q?Dol}nell of the wqve_-surmpunting prows.
? O?Ruark, Maguire, those souls of ?re. whose names are
shrined in story??? .
They boast of those, whose deeds of old, made ? Eriri?s bright-
est glory.?
? They boast of Clan MacCaura, and of matchless Owen Roe,
Of Dathi, Desmond, Cathal Mor, who never murdered foe.
?They boast of those whose manly deeds disgrace the boasters
most - . ~ ? '
They boast: of their religion, too, yet murder while they boast.
?*' They boast ofErin?sloveliness, her mountain, vale, and ?ood,
Her shrines and holy places, yet they dabble her with blood,
The life-blood of a. brother, of the wife and o?spring, too.
Ay, crimson her with blood of these,then shout? Lamb-dearg-
aboo.?
??Lamb-dearg-aboo, Lamb-dearg-aboo,? the red or bloody
hand, '
Is truly now the crest and cry of all the Irish land,


For o?er the ?Isle of Saints,? behold, tremendous Murden
sweep, . -
While priest and peasant, jubilant, a glad carousal keep.?
?And o?er the earth the Irish roam, to beg in many a land,
The guilty gold to strengthen more the foul assas.+in?s hand ;
And Erin?s sons, and daughters, too, on many a foreign shore,
Rejoicingly make strong that hand that?s red with Irish gore.
?They cry ? We?ll make our native land a nation once again,
Our country shall be governed by her sons, our countrymen,
We?ll have no monarch but the king, whose race is of our own,"
They have him?Purple Murder sits there on his bloodwashed
throne.
? The chosen leaf of hard and chief,? in clotted festoon climbs
Around the monstrous brow of this gigantic priest of crimes,
While churchman, hind and patriot (Hi), his scarlet livery
?aunt,
And do him reverence, kneeling round the holy-Water font.
? Oh, guilty people, wretched land, how long shall this endure '.7.
How long shall Romish tyranny hold you in bonds secure?
How long shall Superstition veil Religion from your eyes.
And make you Worship sculptured stones as saving deities?
? So lgng as priestcraft shades the soul, as clouds obscure the?
star
The natizres of the ?Sainted Isle? shall be the things they are.
Bloodthirsty props of Popery, yet spat upon by Rome,
Disturbers of the peace abroad, and nmrderers at home.?
She ceased, and bounding to her side,
I knelt and clasped her hand,
And ? Tell me whence art thou?? I cried,
Then sad and slowly she replied,
?From Erin?s blbod-staiixed land.
? I was the guardian of that shore,
The Genius of its clime.
But I may} tarry there no more,
The vigil that I kept is o?er ;


I?m banished hence by crime.?
The evening deepened as she spoke,
The shadows darker grew, ?
Then from my loving clasp she broke
And faded from my view.
If any expressions in these rhymes should appear too
? hot? or ? bitter? to the taste of jelly-kneedfProtestants, I
beg to state that they _are not worse than the terms applied by
the treason-inspiring scoundrel, Bigger, to the Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, Earl Spencer, whom he called a ?bloodthursty
English peer.?
