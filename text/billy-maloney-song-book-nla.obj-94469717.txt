There’s a girl who lives across the way from
me,
She is pretty, witty, sweet as she can be;
Boys take her out ev’ry evening they call,
Later they come back and stand in the hall,
Whenever a boy wants to stay,
She sends him home, in this way:
Chorus.
Ta-Ta! I’ll have to bid you good-night,
Ta-Ta, I’ll say you treated me right,
Please go, you know, it’s getting late,
To be candid, You take to darn much for
granted,
Ta-Ta, you’d better leave me alone,
You musn’t hold me so tight,
Tho’ you can take me to my door, dear,
There isn’t any more dear,
Ta-Ta! Ta-Ta! Good-night.
Thru’ my window every evening I would see
Just what always happened to her company;
She never did anything that was wrong,
Still with the boys, somehow she’d get along,
An hour or so they would spend,
This is the way it would end:
Chorus.
Ta-Ta! It seems I’ve known you for years,
Ta-Ta, you’ve got a lot of ideas, ' '
I’m wise, your eyes, give you away,
Tho’ you’re quiet, if you’d start you’d be a riot.
Ta-Ta, I couldn’t give you one kiss,
Not now, but some day I might,
Your line of talk is bright and breezy,
But do I look that easy?
Ta-Ta! Ta-Ta! Good-night.

You know my friend Smith, the New \orker?
He’s a writer as well as a talker.
He has written a song.
And 1 don’t think I’m wrong
When 1 say it’s a regular “corker”!
Chorus.
Toodle-oo! toodle-oo!
If you’ll wait a few minutes we’ll sing it to you.
There was a young lady of Brighton
Who said, “All the prudes 1 will frighten!”
She bathed from the shore
And the crowd said, “Good lor!”
For the costume she wore was a tight ’un.
Toodle-oo! it was warm,
But ev’ryone said she showed excellent form.
There was a young flapper of Gloucester,
Her friends think she’s quite an impostor.
She was thin as a lath,
And when taking her bath,
She slipped down the plug-hole and they lost her.
Toodle-oo! what a stir!
They found a few soap-suds but couldn’t find
her.
A racing young fellow from Girton
A short time ago had a “cert” on.
The horse dropped down dead.
He’s confined to his bed,
For the silly young pup put his shirt on.
Toodle-oo! do not shout.
He wears his wife’s “nightie” now when he
goes out.
There was a young girl of New Guinea,
She ate some green plums, did poor Winnie.
The doctor looked glum


When they asked him to come,
For she had a pain under her “pinnie.”
Toodle-oo! do not groan,
She s increased her weight, for she swallowed
a “stone.”

Georgie White, ev’ry night
Used to call and see his little bunch of delight.
But Susie stuttered so much, it’s true,
It took her half-an-hour to murmur “I love you.”
When the clock was striking nine.
He’d give her a parting kiss,
But he never got away
Till the break of the day,
And the reason was simply this:
Chorus.
every time he tried to say “Good-night,”
She’d say “K-k-k-kiss me again
Every time he made for the door
She’d say, “K-k-k-kiss me some more.”
There he’d stand, hat in hand,
Trying to escape in vain;
But every time he tried to say “Good-night,”
She’d say “G-G-Georgie, t-t-turn out the light,
And c-c-come back and c-cuddle me tight
And k-k-k-kiss me again.”
They got wed and it’s said,
They were both delighted after twelve months
had fled,
A little stranger came into town,
They took it to be christened by old Parson
Brown,
When he asked them Baby’s name,
She said with a smile serene,
“It’s w-w-w-w-w-woo,”
Well, before she was thro’
The young baby had turned sixteen.

Many men have only got just one idea of what a
pretty girl should be,
Only one will do for them,
But that I fear, would never, never do for me.
Every time I look at one my brain begins to
whirl
I don’t care what she is like
So long as she’s a girl
Chorus
I like ’em young, I like ’em old,
I like ’em warm, I like ’em cold,
The haughty ones, the naughty ones, the twenty
Or the forty ones, also the roarty ones.
I like ’em gay, I like 'em sad,
I like ’em good, I like 'em bad,
I like the frilly ones, the chilly ones,
The Chutney Piccadilly ones,
The throbby ones, the nobby ones,
“ I shall call the bobby ones,”
The cheerv ones, the weary ones,
The bubbly or the beery ones,
I like ’em all
2nd Chorus
I like ’em tame, I like ’em wild,
I like ’em strong, I like ’em mild.
The fluffy ones, the huffy ones,
The rouge and powder puffy ones,
Also the duffy ones,
I like ’em soft, I like ’em loud,
I like ’em meek, I like 'em proud,
I like the boring ones, the roaring ones,


The quiet ones, the snoring ones,
The dandy ones, the candy ones,
The straight ones, and the bandy ones,
The dressing ones, the pressing ones,
The “ stop your blooming messing” ones,
I like ’em all
Every girlie in the world has got some charm,
That I can never seem to miss,
Whether it’s an ankle or a face, or arm,
Or whether it’s a special kis?.
“ One man’s poison is anothers meat” you'll a
agree;
But as far as girlies go they all are meat to me
Chorus
II ike ’em dull, I like ’em smart,
I like ’em sweet, I like ’em tart,
The winning ones, the chinning ones,
The good ones and the sinning ones,
Also the ginning ones,
I like ’em thin, I like ’em fat,
I like ’em long, I like ’em flat,
I like the daring ones, the swearing ones,
The back and shoulders baring ones,
The breezy one&, the wheezy ones,
The skirts above the kneesy ones,
The knowing ones, the owing ones,
The don’t care what I’m showing ones,
I like ’em all
Last Chorus
I like ’em dark, I like ’em fair,
I like ’em round, I like ’em square,
The floppy ones, the shoppy ones,
The little four p’ny hoppy ones,
Likewise the sloppv ones.
I like ’em slow, I like ’em chaste,
I like ’em loose, I like ’em laced,
I like the wary ones, the fairy ones,
The bald ones and the hairy ones,
The eager ones, the meagre ones,
The meet at the bodega ones.
The risky ones, the friskv ones,
The “ mine’s a double whisky ones,’
I like ’em all

Maloney.
What is the cry that makes you sigh
When walking down the street,
Keep to the left! Keep to the left!
You nearly drop when a great big cop.
Shouts out along his beat,
Keep to the left! Keep to the left!
You stop when in a crowd to light a tiny
cigarette
Or to have a chat with someone that you see.
The flappers they bump into you, the others at
you glare,
I’ve sampled it so it seems to me.
Chorus:
When on the right side you’re on the wrong side,
But on the left side you’re on the right,
When you’re strolling round old Sydney town,
You don’t know whether to walk or run,
You’re safer lying down.
For on the right side you’re on the wrong side
Then you hear the policemen yell with all their
might,
If you want to get on in Aussie, John,
Sing and jog along.
Keep to the left and follow you nose,
And then you can’t go wrong,
For on the right side is always the wrong side,
But on the left side your alright.
I got a fright, my wife last night shouted in her sleep
Keep to the left! Keep to the left!
You read the paper someone’s left a fortune,
then I shriek,
“Keep to the left; I’ve nothing left.”
We’ve got a brand-new baby boy, the idol of
my life.
I bounce him up and down upon my knee,
I’ve waited patiently to hear the little chappie talk,
And yesterday he just said to me —

Australasia: Albert and Son, Sydney.
What’s the finest place there is?
What’s the finest place there is?
What’s the finest place there is ?
Why, Pennsylvani-ah.
You might think No,
You might think Yes,
Might think it’s an awful mess,
But you can bet that my address
Is Pennsylvani-ah! .
That’s the place where they have glass windows,
And twice one are two,
That’s the place where chimneys smoke,
Because they cannot chew.
Chorus:
Ta-ta! Ta-ta! We’re off to Pennsylvani-ah!
Pennsylvani-ah, to see my ma and pa,
I’ve got a rabbit, white as snow,
I say to him buck up and grow,
But he can’t buck up ’cos she’s a doe,
In Pennsylvani-ah.
Where was my poor father hung?
Where was my poor father hung?
Round mother’s neck, and there he clung,
In Pennsylvani-ah.
You should go there for it’s hell.
You should go there for it’s hell,
You should go there, for it’s healthy
Pennsylvani-ah.
That’s the place where the Pekin poodles
Wag their “to’s and froms.”
That’s the place where cats have kittens
If they are not Toms,


Chorus:
Ta-ta! Ta-ta! We’re off to Pennsylvani-ah!
Pennsylvani-ah, to see my ma and pa,
We’ve got a chicken, he would not lay,
We cut his legs off one fine day,
He can’t stand up, so he’s got to lay.
In Pennsylvani-ah.
Where was it my mother died ?
Where was it my mother dyed
Her ginger hair with peroxide?
In Pennsylvani-ah.
All the girls are full of gin—,
All the girls are full of gin—,
Full of ginger ’way down home
In Pennsylvani-ah.
That’s the place where they’re all teetotal,
Whether old or young.
They never let you touch a glass,
You all drink from the bung.
Second last chorus:
Ta-ta! Ta-ta! We’re off to Pennsylvani-ah!
Pennsylvani-ah, to see my ma and pa.
Finest pigs and the finest men,
They’re got out there and soon again
I’ll be back home and in my pen
In Pennsylvani-ah.
Last chorus:
Ta-ta! Ta-ta! We’re off to Pennsylvani-ah!
Pennsylvani-ah, to see my ma and pa.
With the cows they’ve got a scheme,
They’ve fed on ice, and it’s a scream!
They milk them and they get i(£-cream
In Pennsylvani-ah.

Where are you going at Xmas time?
The seas divine, but not for mine.
Pm going out where there’s lots of fun
And nobody gets the spike,
It’s not very far from Brisbane,
You can get there on a bike.
You seem in doubt, you can’t make it out,
It’s a place that you all like.
Chorus:
Wooloongabba, Wooloongabba,
Think of the things they do at Wooloongabba.
Oh, what a lovely sight some beautiful summer’s
night,
Strolling round away from all the
light.
Wooloongabba, Wooloongabba,
You’ve all the other places beat by far.
There’s Stanley Street where it’s rather dark,
Indooroopilly and Itchy Park,
But give me Wool, Wool, Wooloongabba.
The Prince of Wales when he landed here
All deboniar and full of cheer,
Was motored all round old Brisbane town
And treated to all the best.
They took him to Dornock Terrace,
It made him feel quite proud,
And, oh, what a shock the governor got
When he shouted out aloud —
(Catch lines)
When a chap with his girlie strays,
He can ask her to marry him in five ways.

Feist, Inc.
I met a pal from Tennessee,
And with a smile he greeted me,
For he was feeling happy, mighty snappy,
Jumping up and down with glee;
He got good news from home to-day,
And that's the reason he felt gay,
I thought it was pimply great, just had to
congratulate,
When I heard him say :
Chorus:
“I’ve got ten little fingers, and ten little toes,
Down in Tennessee, waiting there for me,
I never had a baby call me ‘Dada,’ how proud
I know I’ll be,
When I hear it calling me, Oh gee!
I’ll kiss ev’ry finger, I’ll kiss ev’ry toe,
At Home Sweet Home I’ll linger, for they’ll
need me there I know,
Altho’ it only weighs ten pounds and just one
day old,
I wouldn’t give it up for all the world and its
gold,
For I’ve got ten little fingers, and ten little
toes
Waiting down in Tennessee for me.”
He said, “I’m leaving town to-day,
I hope and pray there’s no delay,
I’m going to get my ticket, double quickit,
Not a thing could make me stay;
I long to see my little prize,


And look into those baby eyes,
just try to imagine me, back home in Ten-
nessee,
Oh, what a Paradise:
Chorus:
“I’ve got ten little fingers, and ten little toes,
Down in Tennessee, waiting there for me,
Oh, how I’ll hold it, in my arms enfold it,
When night time shadows creep, I will lull it
fast asleep,
And then I’ll count ev’ry finger, I’ll count ev’ry toe
Close to his side I’ll linger, for he’ll want me
there, I know,
If he looks like his mother, what a child he
must be,
But if he looks like me, then he’s got my sym-
pathy,
For I’ve got ten little fingers, and ten little toes,
Waiting down in Tennessee for me.”

On the "Nancy Lee”
Written and composed by Bert Lee and Reg. Low

arrangement with Francis, Day and Hunter,
London, W. (Publishers of the Musie).
Australasian Agents—Albert & Son, Sydney
Jim Johnson said at the club one day,
“Oh, for a life on the foaming spray!
Let’s all have a week on the rolling sea!”
So we charter’d a vessel call’d the “Nancy Lee.”
We walked on board like jolly Jacks,
The skipper shouted, “Hoist yer slacks!”
“I’m hoisting mine,” said Johnny Gough,
“’Cos I’ve only one button and that’s come off!”
Chorus:
On the “Nancy Lee,” on the “Nancy Lee,”
We’d been at sea two hours or so
When the skipper cried, “We’re moving slow.”
Then he look’d round and said, “Oh, gee!
She’s tied to the jetty, is the “Nancy Lee.”
“We’re off!” said Brown, with a loud “Yo ho!”
“Cheer for the king just before we go!”
“We cheer’d for the king and the Union Jack,


The queen and the ace and then the whole
darn’d pack,
The skipper eyed the evening star,
And said, “We’ll make for the harbour bar,
Said Brown, “The bar will suit me fine.
But run like the divil ’cos it’s ten past nine!
Chorus:
On the “Nancy Lee,” on the “Nancy Lee,”
The skipper stood and aired his views,
The wind blew round his “How-d’ye-do’s.”
He had no patch where a patch should be,
And he felt draughty on the “Nancy Lee.”
Then up there came from the ocean blue
A beautiful mermaid, who said, “Goo-goo J” _
She wink’d at the crew and she smil’d with
grace,
And she swish’d her swisher in the bosun s face.
The skipper look’d and said, “That’s odd!
She’s half a girl and half a cod,”
He saw her tail and said “You peach,
If we’d only got some chips we’d have a
penn’orth of each!”
Chorus:
On the “Nancy Lee,” on the “Nancy Lee,”
The mermaid shouted, “Good-bye, crew!”
And as she div'd into the blue,
She wagg’d her periscope at me,
I was glad the missus wasn’t on the “Nancy Lee
The skipper shouted, “Oh, darn my socks!
There’s a hole in the boat, for we’re on the
rocks, _
The sea’s rushing in, without a doubt;
So we bored another hole to let it out.
The vessel play’d at pitch and toss,
We couldn’t stand; it made us cross;
I felt so sorry for Bosun Jupp,
’Cos he sat upon the anchor and he was cut up.
Chorus:
On the “Nancy Lee,” on the “Nancy Lee,”
Said Brown, “For home I think we’ll steer,”
And as we sail’d for Brixton Pier,
We cried good-bye to the rolling sea,
And no more sailing on the “Nancy Lee.”

Here of late I’ve heard people saying that
they’ve had their share
Of troubles and of care, here and everywhere,
So in case you’re one of the ones who think the
world all wrong,
You’ll find a real good tonic in the chorus erf
this song:
Chorus:
Pucker up and whistle till the clouds roll by,
Have a happy little twinkle in your eye,
Lend your ear to something worth while
list’ning to;
Just remember frowning was never meant for
you.
Pucker up and whistle tho’ the day seems dark,
That’s the time to wear a great big smile,
Don’t you give dull care a tumble,
Let the other fellow grumble,
Pucker up and whistle all the while.
Don’t forget that back of the blackest cloud
you’ll always find
The sky is silver-lined with clouds of brightes)
kind,
So instead of scowling and pouting, think of
what’s to come,
I’m sure you’ll find it worth your while to smile
and gaily hum:

Girls are driving me crazy, they’re so tiresome
and lazy,
I’ve got something new, it’s just a baby dolly.
No more money I’m spending on their wishes
unending, I
I’ve a little dream girl coming from Dolly land.
I just call her my Jicky,
With her hair so soft and curling,
Pretty and entrancing,
Sets my senses dancing
With her dimpling fascinating smile,
Jicky, winsome, beguiling,
Never minding what I say,
For she’s only just a toy,
But she brings me lots of joy
With her sunny, saucy comfy little way.
With her figure so “dinky,” and complexion so
pinky,
Never scolding, never cross, but always pleas-
ing.
If sometimes I forget her and sometimes I
neglect her,
She will never rag me like alb the other girls.
I just call her my Jicky,
With her hair so soft and curling,
Pretty and entrancing,
Sets my senses dancing,
With her dimpling fascinating smile,
Jicky, winsome, beguiling,
Never minding what I say,
For she’s only just a toy,
But she brings me lots of joy
With her sunny, saucy, comfy little way.

Alice once fell asleep and she was dreaming,
When she awoke she started screaming,
Filled with fright;
“Alice, your dreams of wonderland, unfold
them,”
“’Twas like a blunder land,” she told them, late
that night.
(Just picture)
Chorus:
Down in funny Jabberwocky town,
Down where everything is upside down.
Everybody there, has no sense nor do they care,
Not a jail or a cop, oh pop, imagine down,
In funny Jabberwocky town.
Down where black is white and green is brown,
Each costume is like a crazy patch,
Each house a booby hatch;
Everybody is a clown
In funny Jabberwocky town.
Alice saw many sights that were amusing,
But they were awfully confusing, so she said;
Alice could not make out if she’d be landing
Upon her feet or soon be standing on her head,
Toowoomba Chorus
T double O-W double O-M-B-A,
The queen of the cities of the north so gay.
They sing of Indooripilly—
They’ve got it on the brain;
You hear them yabba of Wolloongabba,
They drive you right insane.
T double O-W double O-M-B-A,
Australia is proud of you.
You all know Brisbane, a fine old joint.
But what O on Sunday at Picnic Point?
Toowoomba, Toowoomba, I love you.

His garments were tatter’d, the world so unkind,
Had left a poor vagabond far, far behind.
He enter’d a tap-room, the kindly old host said,
“Drink, lad, and deeply, and give us a toast!”
“My toast,” said the tramp, “let your glasses all
clink,
Is to swearing and lying, and stealing and drink!”
They frown’d, but he said, with his glass in his
hand,
“Let’s drink to them all, but don’t misunder-
stand.
Chorus:
“When you swear, swear by the land of your
birth;
And when you lie, He for a woman of worth.
When you steal, steal away from friends un-
true ;
And when you drink, just drink good health to
those who will stand by you!”
Said he, “Now, I swear, tho’ I’ve scarcely a rag,
And I lost my all in defence of the flag,
I’ll lose that and more; but I’ll shrink from the
lie,
Of a wife’s broken vow when she’d kissed me
good-bye.
And 1 stole away with a tear from the path
Of the friend who with stealth took my wife
from my hearth.
But I drink to all, just as all drink to me,
And I say to you, vagabond tho’ I be:


Who Killed Pussyfoot
MISTER PUSSYFOOT
(By A. J. Mills, Felix Le Roy and Harry Castling)
Sung by Billy Maloney
Publishers: Star Music Pub. Co., London, W.
There’s going to be a hulla-baloo
In Aussie, so they say,
For Pussyfoot has now arrived,
The guy from U.S.A.
He’s going to close up all the pubs,
He tells us, when he starts.
The only drink we’ll get is round
The pumps and water carts;
And dear Algy you’ll see strolling down the
Strand, . . . , ,
With a penny ice-cream cornet in his hand.
Chorus:
And it’s all through you, Mister Pussyfoot,
Puss! Puss! Puss! Puss! Mister Pussyfoot;
By and bye, we’ll all be dry,
No more going out upon the tiddley-hi;
When you close the public houses,
We shall see in a year or two,
Mother with a lollipop,
Father sucking an acid drop,
Puss! Puss! Pussyfoot, it’s all through you.
' Chorus (air, Cock Robin).
Who killed Pussyfoot?
I did. said Jim Dooley, it was little me.
When he wasn’t looking, I put some poison in
his tea,
I killed Pussyfoot.
Who saw him die?
I did, said Billy Hughes—
In language very thick —
“I saw him drink from his claret cup-- _
And he snuffed it pretty _ quick, Isa v him die
Refrain.
Then the pubs and the breweries served out
free shicker
When they heard of the death of this silly old
slicker
When they heard of the death of poor old
Pussyfoot.

Folks, I want to ask you something: Have you
seen my sweet?
She’s the girl you stop and stare at, walking
down the street;
There is really no use asking if you’ve seen this
miss.
I am sure you’ve seen her, so let me ask you
this:
Chorus;
Did you see that pretty dress? Say, I gave her
that.
And that look of happiness? Say, I gave her
that;
You should see her flat and her great big picture
hat,
You’d declare it’s a bear. I gave her that.
Did you see her motor car? Say, I gave her
that:
I love her so much I hardly know where I’m at!
Oh, she’s a mighty pretty sight, and her eyes are
black as night.
But the left is blacker than the right, and I gave
her that.
When I’m walking with my sweetie up and down
Broadway,
You should see the fellows staring—hear the
things they say;
They all claim that I could never win this nifty
miss.
When they ask if she is mine, I just tell them
this;


Chorus:
Did you see that pretty dress? Say, I gave her
that. ‘. _ _ ,
And that look of happiness? Say, I gave her
that: . , ~
You should see her flat and her great big picture
hat
You’d declare it's a bear. I gave her that.
Did you see her solitaire? Say, I gave her that:
When she got that ring she more than smiled,
she went wild! . , .
But did you see her yesterday with that baby on
Broadway? , , , ,
Wasn’t that some baby? Say, that s her sisters
child.

Somewhere in Ireland far over the sea,
A sweet little Colleen is waiting for me;
When I went away I said it won’t be long,
Sure all day it’s me who keeps singing this song.
Chorus:
Pretty Kitty Kelly, she’s the only girl for me;
Pretty Kitty Kelly, she is all my eyes can see;
For there’s not a colleen sweeter in the land
where shamrock grows,
Than my pretty Kitty Kelly, she’s my wild Irish
rose.
I wrote a letter to Kitty, my own,
And told her thaat I’d soon be starting for
home. , ,
I know when she reads it, twill sure make her
smile, . „ , ...
Oh, faith and I can’t help but sing all the while.

This old world of ours is a funny proposition
all the time,
You’re born against your wish,
And they don’t ask your permish;
Life seems good at first
When you’re just a daft young coon,
But if you’ve any wisdom, if you get some fun,
You will say, “Don’t laugh too soon!”
Chorus:
There’s a catch in it somewhere,
Oh, it’s too good to be true!
There’s a catch in it somewhere,
Grim fate is going to get you.
You’re working and striving and a-schemmg and
conniving
Just to get that pile of dough, < t
Then you wake up in bed an’ you discover you re
a dead ’un,
To your funeral you go.
All your friends who’re bereft keep on saying,
“What’s he left?”
But you know that all your share
Is the flowers on your chest,
And you’re saying, “Well, I’m bless’d!”
I knew there was a catch somewhere.
There’s a catch in it somewhere.
To your door one day comes an elegant insure
ance gentleman,
He says, “Pay half-a-crown,
And if your house gets burnt down,


OU get five hundred pounds'
It s a chance you should not miss.”
°nrV he m< i ney ’ then you think and think,
Oh, its much too easy this!”

Then you gaze upon her nose, and say, “Crikey,

At the gay seaside once I heard a little lady
softly say,
“What, pay for tents ?” no fear!
I can take a dip from here,
She took off her coat,
Then she kick’d off both her shoes,
Then she pull’d off her stockings, while I said,
“Great Scott!”
There was nothing to excuse.
Chorus:
There’s a catch in it somewhere,
She looks an innocent peach!
There’s a catch in it somewhere,
And soon right there on the beach,
Oh, she took off her jumper, and my heart be-
gan to thump
Against my ribs, and miss-fir’d twice;
Then she took off her skirt an’ camisole, and I
was certain
There was nothing quite so nice.
Standing in the sea-breeze, then she took off
her C.B.’s,
Pulled a string behind, and there
She was—oh, you’ll never guess! she was in her
bathing dress;
Oh, I knew there was a catch somewhere!

When you marry a girl it isn’t a thing that you
often do,
But when you marry a girl has it ever occurred
to you
You’re getting the biggest bargain ever known
upon the earth.
No matter what the lady’s like, you’re sure of
your money’s worth.
Chorus.
Think of what you’re getting just for seven-
and six!
What a lovely lump of love for seven-and-
six!
Oh, my! that’s the stuff to buy.
Taking her all round, it isn’t a penny a pound
For her hair, nose, eyes, clothes,
And all the lovely bag o’ tricks.
If it weren’t against the law, I’d be having
three or four
At seven-and-six, seven-and-six, seven-and-
six.
What is seven-and-six ? It isn’t the price of a
decent lunch.
A paltry seven-and-six, and you’ve something
you can munch.
The av’rage weight of a maiden is about nine
. stone or so.
Can you get nine stone of frozen mutton for
seven-and-sixpence? No!
Chorus.—Think of What, etc.
Change last three lines of Chorus each time :
Oh, you couldn’t buy the bows
On her—well, I don’t suppose,
For seven-and-six, seven-and-six, seven-and-
six.


When you go to a show, what seat can you get
for seven-and-six?
You sit and holler “Bravo” to the lady who does
high kicks.
You only see one performance; but get married
—that’s the wheeze.
Have your own revue twice nightly, and a mati-
nee when you please.
Patter (after third verse) :
Oh, ’s lovely! you sit by the fire, and she sings
to you, .
When you roll home at two in the morning she
does her patter act,
While you do your balancing performance.
But, putting all jokes on one side, when you go
home there she is;
Every kiss she gives you is worth seven-and-six;
And every year or so down will come the nurse
with the interest on your money —at par —
And you’re hoping there isn’t a bonus.
Chorus. —Think of What. etc.
Why, without her clothes so nice,
Any girl is worth the price
Of seven-and-six, seven-and-six, seven-and-
six.

Matilda, I am singing to you ’neath your window
pane.
My voice has crack’d the window; still, I hope
you won’t complain.


I have to sing outside to you—the reason why
is clear;
Your father won’t allow me in the house,
Matilda dear.
Refrain:
Your father’s most insulting,
Your father’s most insulting,
To kick against his rudeness I incline,
But though I’d like to kick, Matilda.
Kick Matilda, Kick Matilda,
I will never kick, Matilda mine.
I want to settle down, although I’ll own I’ve had
my fling.
But you’ve that kind of face, dear, that would
settle anything.
I know I’ve been to night clubs and I’ve not
come home till three,
But I’ll come home at kalf-past two if you will
marry me.
Refrain:
I’ll pull myself together,
I’ll pull myself together,
Yes, I’ll come up to scratch and toe the line.
Yes, I’ll come up to scratch, Matilda, scratch,
Matilda, scratch, Matilda.
I’ll come up to scratch, Matilda mine.
So come and hear my tale of love beneath the
moonbeams pale.
Matilda, dear, you surely know how well I tell
the tale.
I swear my love is constant —yes, I swear it’s
not a sham!
So come and hear me swear to-night beside the
old mill dam.
Refrain:
Matilda, won’t you meet me?
Matilda, won’t you meet me?
Beside the old mill dam at half-past nine?
Oh, meet me by the dam, Matilda, dam Matilda,
dam, Matilda,
Meet me by the dam, Matilda mine.

Any Girl from Anywhere

Re-printed and Published by Joe Slater by arrangement
with Francis, Day & Hunter, London W. (publishers

Australasian Sole Agents—Albert & Son, Sydney
I like ladies’ society,
I like girls in variety,
Don’t specialize in any size
If they’re thin or fat ’uns,
I am fond of any patterns.
If they’re dark or got ginger roots,
With complexions that come from Boots,
Frenchy girls or Russians,
Swiss or Shepherds Bush’uns, _
They’re all the same to me, let ’em all come!
Chorus;
Any girl from anywhere, as long as she’s
a real nice girl!
From France or Russia, Angleterre.
Scotland or Ireland, I don’t care.
Any miss who likes a kiss.
I love to spoon a Frenchy pearl—
Macherie, Mamselle Louise, you are as sweet as
sugar!
Oui, Monsieur, I am so sweet, I chew ze Frenchy
nougat,
Sacrebleu, I stick to you like toffee Macintosh’s,
Merci beaucoup, pomgies de terre, but not in
these galoshes.
Any bit of fluff is good enough, as long as she’s
a real nice girl.
Some like girls of the haughty kind,
Some like girls of the naughty kind,
Girls full of sport—you know the sort —
Hear ’em say, “Don’t grapple!
George, you’ve bit my Adam’s apple.”
If their figures are far from thin,
If they bulge out and won’t come in,
Simple girls or wide ’uns,
Straight or swivel-ey’d ’uns,
This is my battle-cry—Send a harem!


Chorus:
Any girl from anywhere, as long as she’s a real
nice girl!
From France or Russia, Angleterre,
Scotland or Ireland, I don’t care.
Any miss who likes a kiss.
I love to spoon a Sydney pearl—
By gum, Mary Ellen, you’re a champion little
fiUy!
Don’t start to gab so much, and hop off home,
John Willie. .
Fair dink, in your Sunday togs you looks a fair
bewitcher!
Now then, stop yer messing, or I’ll plug thee
one on t’snitcher!
Any bit of fluff is good enough, as long as she’s
a real nice girl.

In sweet Lim’rick Town, they say,
Lived a chap named Patrick John Molloy,
Once he sail’d to U.S.A.,
His luck in foreign parts he thought he’d try.
Now he’s made his name, and is a wealthy man,
He put a bit away for a rainy day;
So if you gaze upon the house of Patrick John,
You’ll find a notice that goes on to say:
Chorus:
If you’re Irish come into the parlour,
There’s a welcome there for you;
If your name is Timothy or Pat,
So long as you come from Ireland,
There’s a welcome on the mat.
If you come from the mountains of Mourne,


Or Killarney’s lakes so blue,
We’ll sing you a song and we’ll make a fuss,
Whoever you are you are one of us,
If you’re Irish, this is the place for you I
Patrick loved the girl he wed,
But he could not stand his ma-in-law,
Once with joy he turned quite red,
When she got into trouble thro’ her jaw,
Six police they had to take her to the court,
She was informed a month she would have to do,
So Patrick quickly wrote up to the judge a note,
Explaining, “Sir, I’m much obliged to you!”
Wrap the Green Flag Around
Me Boys
(By O’Rosallais.)
Sung by Talbot O’Farrell.
Published by Joe Slater Publishing Co., Sydney.
Oh, wrap the Green Flag around me, boys,
To die where Parnell sleeps,
With Erin’s noble emblem, boys,
To be my winding sheath.
In life I hope to see it with those dear who
fought and bled,
But now my eyes grow dim, my heart
Would grasp its last life’s prayer.
And I had hoped to meet you, boys,
But then you’re welcome still.
When poor, the trials I’ll tell you, boys,
Your friends of word and will.
But now, alas, I am denied my dearest earthly
prayer,
You follow on, you’ll meet the foe, but I will
not be there.
And though my body lies still, me boys,
My spirit will be free,
And every comrade on our side
Will still be dear to me.
And in the fierce and bloody fight, don’t let
your courage lack,
For I’ll be there and hovering near,
Around the dear old Flag.

You hear of the south,
You read of the West,
You dream of the east,
But which is the best?
Katoomba, that’s the place to be,
While roaming around all over the ground,
I’ve travelled far, but I’ve always found
The West is just the spot for me.
Chorus:
K-A-T double O-M-B-A,
The blue mountain paradise,
So bright and gay;
They sing of Yarrawonga, they’ve got it on the
brain,
You hear them chatter of Parramatta, they drive
you right insane.
K-A-T double O-M-B-A,
Australia is proud of you.
We all know Sydney, a fine old joint,
But what oh on Sunday at Echo Point,
Katoomba, Katoomba, I love you.
The climate is grand, the scenery great,
With every land you’ll carry your weight.
Katoomba, that’s a fine old name —
The valleys and caves, the mountain air,
The world just raves of your beauty rare;
You’re risin’ to the height of fame.

A pretty lady used to come to our house
When I was only just a few years old,
Father was in love with her, mother didn’t care.
Always used to sit her in the best arm-chair.
I used to kiss her hands so white,
And whisper when I said good night.
Chorus:
LiT old Granny mine,
How your dear old bright eyes shine!
And your snow-white hair is beautiful to see,
It’s just the sweetest thing in all the world to
me.
LiT old Granny mine,
When your dear sweet face I see,
I remember that the good Lord gave my
mammy to you,
And you gave my mammy to me.
She’d love to have the children romping round
her.
Somehow they never seem’d to make her tir’d;
Said it made her young again, just to hear their
play.
Maybe Granny knew she hadn’t long to stay.
For now we’ve grown too big for toys,
She’s with the angel girls and boys.

There’s a quaint little town that is gaining re-
nown,
But its title sets tourists all swearing,
Aboriginal names give them all funny pains.
At this one word you’ll find them all staring,
It’s an Aussie town, too, it’s in Queensland, *tis
true,
If a new chum should pay it a call.
He says the word with a cough, nearly bites his
tongue off,
And this town is the cause of it all —
Chorus:
I-N-D double O-R double O-P-I double L-Y,
It drives the strangers silly;
They can’t say Indooroopilly, Indooroopilly,
They always say, then spell it with a sigh—
It’s I-N-D double O-R double O-P-I double L-Y.
[nd’roopilly’s a word, though it may seem absurd,
If you can’t say it right you just sneeze it;
But this plan is the best—put it in an ice-chest,
If you once get it right, hold it —freeze it.
My mouth’s getting sore, I’ve dislocated my jaw,
It’s like a leach, when it bites you it grips.
To describe it more plain, gives my tonsils a
pain,
It’s like a piouthful of hot fish and chips.

Old Uncle Ben, he’s been at it again,
Old Uncle Benjamin’s a rascal.
Says he, when I see a little flapper
I feel just' as though I’d like to slap her.
Some like the Queen, who is sweet seventeen,
But I’ve -got no eyes for her,
Although she’s young and slender,
Fair and innocent and tender,
She’s not the kind that I prefer.
Chorus.
I like ’em, I like ’em,
When they’re fair, fat and forty,
When they’re fair, fat and forty, they are
fine,
I like ’em, I like ’em, when they’re nice and
plump.
Your giddy little flapper only gives me the
hump.
I like ’em, I like ’em, when they’re young
enough to cuddle
And old enough to stop out after nine.
Though at eighty they look flighty
In an old red flannel nightie,
But when fair, fat and forty they are fine.
He will declare, though she may have grey hair,
What does it matter if her heart’s young,
For lamb I have never been a glutton,
There’s more flavour in it when it’s mutton.
Give me the fat girl they show at the fair,
Squeezing her I’ll show my skill,
And if one arm will not go round
That young lady from the show ground,
Then darn it, sir, my two arms will.

Got a friend of mine who now is down in
Matewan,
Poor old John, he’s just a little gone,
When I asked him how they came to put him in
cell,
He stamped his foot, and tore his hair, and
then began to yell,
Chorus
Oh, wimmin, wimmin, wimmin, I crave,
For wimmin, wimmin, wimmin, I rave,
Young or old, shy or bold,
Makes no difference if they’re hot or cold,
Oh, pick ’’em, pick ’em, pick ’em for me,
Oh, sig ’em, sig ’em, sig ’em on me,
You take the wine, give me for my share
A rag and a bone, and a hank of hair,
For wimmin, wimmin, wimmin, I fall,
I got to have ’em—that's all
After that he’d quiet down and even read the
news,
Seems he wouldn’t have another spell,
But when he saw a picture of a Zeigfeld chorus
belle,
He stamped his foot, and tore his hair, and
then began to yell:
Chorus
Oh, wimmin, wimmin, wimmin, I crave,
For wimmin, wimmin, wimmin I rave,
Small or tall, bring ’em all.
Listen, listen, to a wild man’s call.
Oh, grab ’em, grab ’em, grab ’em for me,
Oh fetch ’em, fetch ’em, fetch ’em for me,
When they’re not round me I’m always sane,
Show me a skirt, and I’m off again,
For wimmin, wimmin, wimmin I fall,
I got to have ’em—that’s all

Somehow to-night the moon has lost her silvery
smile,
And the stars are looking very lonely, too.
The nightingale is singing such a lonely song,
I’m sure he knows how much I’m missing you.
I wonder if the world is fair for you to-night,
Or, if for you the moon has such a dreary light.
I wonder if the world’s all wrong for you,
dear,
I wonder if my lips could set it right.
Refrain.
Lonely, all the world to-night seems lonely,
Dear, I send a breeze to kiss you,
And to tell you how I miss you,
How I miss you.
Whisp’ring to the winds that blow above you,
My dear, I’m lonely,
Are you lonely too?
Come back to me, my love, I wait for you alone,
And knowing that your duty you must do.
The crowded world around me ought to make
me glad,
But it only makes me lonelier for you.
Each night I pray that you’ll come safely home
again,
Each day I smile and try to hide my fear.
No matter what this bad old world might come
to,
I wouldn’t care if you were with me, dear.

Little Lily was, oh, so silly and shy,
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn’t bill and coo;
Every single night some smart fellow would
try,
To cuddle up to her.
But she would cry—
Chorus:
“Ma," he’s making eyes at me,
“Ma,” he’s awful nice to me,
“Ma,” he’s almost breaking my heart;
Pm beside him,
Mercy, let his conscience guide him;
“Ma,” he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Every minute he gets bolder,
Now he’s leaning on my shoulder;
“Ma,” he’s kissing me.
Lily was so good, everybody could tell;
You’d never see her roam,
She’d always stay at home:
All the nieghbors knew little Lily too well,
For when the boys would call,
They’d hear her yell:
Chorus
“ Ma,” he’s making eyes at me,
“ Ma,” he’s awful nice to me,
“ Ma,” he’s almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in,
Can’t you see I’m goin’ to weak-in’,
“ Ma,” he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee,
Ma I’m meeting with resistance,
I shall holler for assistance,
“ Ma,” he’s kissing me

Mabel taught the children at a school
To recite the “Twice Times” table.
Johnny was her boy, and as a rule
He would wait at the gate for Mabel.
He lov’d to watch her pointing to the blackboard
with her cane,
And hear the children join her in this beautiful
refrain:
Chorus.
“Twice one are two!
Twice two are four!
Twice three are six,” you’ve heard that before.
And John used to wait till the school had gone,
And kiss little Mabel, and she’d say, “Oh, John!”
Twice one are two! twice two are four!
Up to twelve times twelve, and then,
Having kissed little Mabel thro’ the “Twelve
Times” table,
He would start all over again.
Nightly, when the stars shone bright above,
To the woods he would escort her.
All the magic A B C of love
Right from A down to Z he taught her,
In school against the blackboard they would
tenderly caress,
And when she turn’d her back, you’d see this
chalk’d upon her dress:
Chorus (same as first).
Johnny and dear Mabel are wed,
Sitting round their dining table,
Many mouths are waiting to be fed,
And you hear Johnny say to Mabel,
“Three soups for Lill and Bill and Flo, two
puddings for the twins.
How many want roast beef?” and then to count
them he begins:


Last Chorus.
“Twice one are two, twice two are four,
Twice three are six, with the twins on the floor.
There’s Bill and there’s Lill, and there’s Algenon,
There’s Mabel and Abel, and, of course, young John,
Twice four are eight.” Then you’ll hear little Kate
Whisper, “Dad, twice five are ten!”
Then he murmurs to Mabel “ With a larger table
We could start all over again.”

The way they shake just melts away, all the snow,
You read in all the papers about Canadian capers,
Thro’ the storm that’s just how they keep warm
Chorus.
On zero days each maiden sways,
Right in the arms of her own lovin’ Eskimo,
Most ev’ry night when all the northern lights
are low
She toddles ’round with her own northern
Romeo,
In all the snow, while cold winds blow,
Each little Flo, and little Joe,
Just watch them go swing io and fro,
Oh, Tickle Toe,
Now I’ve been told the weather’s cold.
It’s always winter time up where the North
pole lies,
But they cut up Canadian Capers if they’re wise,
And then they watch the temperature begin to rise,
Spoken— (Going up, showing up, blowing up, going
up)
They always do Canadian Capers if the weather’s
cold enough. Spoken (Hey! hey!)
