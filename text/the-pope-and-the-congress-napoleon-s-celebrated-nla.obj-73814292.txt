THE POPE AND THE CONGRESS.
�Wc wish, in a true Catholic spirit, to study a question
which has imprudently become impassioned. ? Passion/
says Montesquieu, c makes us feel, but never makes us see/
Let us then endeavour to banish it from a subject where con-
science and reason can alone speak with authority. Between
those who, detesting the temporal power of the Pope,
loudly invoke his fall, and those who, looking upon that
power as an article of faith, will not allow it to he touched,
there is place for a less exclusive opinion in one sense or the
other. This opinion, which respects equally the rights of
peoples and the interests of religion, protests against that
antagonism to which they are seemingly exposed by absolute
minded men starting from opposite points, and who clash in
a mutual resistance. We sincerely believe that it is not im-
possible for the Sovereign Pontiff to retain his patrimony
without imposing by force upon the populations an autho-
rity which reigns in the name of God. If this conciliation
could be effected it would be a great triumph for politics
and for the Church. Whatever may be the result, the at-
tempt is noble.
� Eirst of all, is the temporal power of the Pope necessary
for the exercise of his spiritual power ? The Catholic doc-
trine and political reason here agree in replying in ?the
affirmative. In a religious point of view it is essential that
the Pope should be a Sovereign. In a political point of
view it is necessary that the head 0f200,000,000 of Catho-
lics should not be dependent on any one,not be subservient
to any Power, and that the august hand which sways the
souls, free from all trammels, should be able to soar above
all human passions. If the Pope were not an independent
Sovereign he would be either French, Spanish, Austrian,or
Italian, and the title of his nationality would deprive him
of his character as universal Pontiff. The Holy See would
be nothing more than the stay of a throne at Paris, Vienna,
or Madrid, It was so at a former period, and a successor
of St. Peter had the misfortune to allow his au-
thority to be absorbed in the c Holy German Em-
pire/ Europe was deeply shaken by it, and that dis-
turbance of its moral and political equilibrium lasted
for nearly three centuries. The struggle between Guelph


and Ghibelline was, in reality, nothing else but an effort to
emancipate the Papacy from the preponderance of the Em-
peror of Germany. Even at the present day,those historical
denominations have survived the events. The head of the
Church is styled Guelph or Ghibelline, according as he is
considered a partisan of Austria or the representative of
Italian nationality and of the independence of the Holy
See. All the great Popes were Guclphs, because the condi-
tion of their glory was to belong to themselves?that is to
say, to acknowledge only the authority of God. When-
ever they made their authority subservient to the in-
terests of a Prince they altered the true principle of their
authority. The Church suffered?Europe suffered from it.
? The spiritual power, the seat of which is at Pome, can-
not be displaced without shaking the political power, not
only in the Catholic States, hut in all Christian States. It
is equally important for England, Russia, and Prussia, as
it is for Erance and Austria, that the august representative
of Catholic unity should neither be constrained, nor
humiliated, nor subordinate. Pome is the centre of a moral
power, too universal for it not to be in the interests of all
Governments and all peoples, that it should not incline to
any side, and that it should remain immovable on the
sacred rock which no human power can overthrow.
? The necessity of the temporal power of the Pope in the
double point of view of the interests of religion and of
political order in Europe is, therefore, clearly proved. Put
what is this power in itself ? How can the Catholic
authority, founded upon dogma, be reconciled with a con-
ventional authority, founded on public morals, human
interests, social wants ? How can the Pope be at the same
time Pontiff and King ? How can the man of the Gospel,
who forgives, be the man of the law, who punishes ? How
can the head of the Church who excommunicates heretics
be the head of the State, who protects freedom of consci-
ence? Such is the problem to be solved. Doubtless the prob-
lem is difficult. There is, in some measure, antagonism be-
tween the Prince and the Pontiff confounded in the same
personification. The Pontiff is bound by principles of divine
order which he cannot discard. The Prince has to respond to
the claims of society which he cannot disown. Where, then,
are the means to be found that the mission of the Pontiff
may find in the independence of the Prince a guarantee of
his authority, without finding therein at the same time an
embarrassment for his conscience ?
?Jf we were to seek for the solution of this problem in the


customary forms of the government of peoples, we should
not find it. There does not exist in the world a constitu-
tion of a nature to conciliate exigencies so diverse. It is
neither by monarchy nor by liberty that this end can
be obtained. The power of the Pope can only be a paternal
power ; he must rather resemble a family than a State.
Thus, not only is it not necessary that his territory should
be of large extent, but we think that it is even essential
that it should be limited. The smaller the territory, the
greater will be the Sovereign.
?In fact, a great State implies certain requirements
(exigences) which it is impossible for the Pope to satisfy.
A great State would like to follow up the politics of the
day, to perfect its institutions, participate in the general
movement of ideas, take advantage of the transformations of
the age, of the conquests of science, of the progress of the
human mind. He cannot do it. The laws will be shack-
led by dogmas. His authority will be paralyzed by traditions.
His patriotism w ill be condemned by faith. He must either
resign himself to immobility, or rise even to revolt. The
world will advance and leave him behind. Then, of tw r 6
things, one will happen,?either everything will be extin-
guished in that people, and nothing will remain in it of the
generous activity of public life, or else the noble aspirations
of nationality will burst through, and it will become neces-
sary, as we have witnessed already, for material force to
supply the deficiencies of moral authority. The temporal
power of the Pope under these conditions cannot maintain
itself unless protected by an Austrian or French military
occupation ; ?a painful resource, for every power that does
not exist upon its national strength and public confidence
is simply an institution?is but an expedient. The Church,
far from finding therein a condition of independence,
only find a cause of discredit and incapacity. This
is not what Prance can wish. This is not what truly re-
ligious men can desire.
? Thus, then, the temporal power of the Pope is neces-
sary and legitimate ; but it is incompatible with a State
of any extent. It is only possible, if exempt from all the
ordinary conditions of power ?that is to say, from
everything that constitutes its activity, its develop-
ment, its progress. It must exist without an army,
without a Parliament, so to say, without a code of laws
or a court of justice. r ltis a distinct system, and which
approaches nearer to family authority than to the govern-
ment of a people. Under this system the dogmas are the


laws, the priests are the legislators, the altars are the
citadels, and the spiritual weapons are the only defence of
the Government. The power lies less in its strength than
in its,weakness ; it is to be found in the respect which it
commands, and in the happiness which it gives to those
to whom it refuses the enjoyments of a political life.
? Hence, it naturally ensues, in our opinion, that the
question is not to ascertain whether the Pope shall have
more or fewer subjects, more or less territory. He must
have sufficient not to be subjugated himself, and to be
a Sovereign of the temporal order. Bnt this sovereignty
must not render it obligatory upon him to act a political part
for then the Pontiff, instead of finding in this power a gua-
rantee of independence, would find only a condition of ser-
vitude for himself, or a necessity of servitude for his people.
? The existence may he admitted in Europe of a small
corner of earth, free from the passions and interests which
agitate other peoples, and devoted solely to the glory of
God. In that corner of earth, illustrated by the grand-
est reminiscences of history, the centre of Catholic unity
has replaced the capital of the world. Pome, which formerly
resumed within her all the grandeur of the Pagan era, has
an exceptional calling. In losing her political domination
she has acquired a domination of a more elevated character
in the spiritual order, and she styles herself the ? Eternal
City ! J Religion, souvenirs, and the arts, also form a
nationality. Those who live at Pome, under the authority
of the Head of the Church, are, doubtless, subject to parti-
cular conditions of social and civil life; but if they are no
longer the members of a great country, they are still the
citizens of a glorious metropolis, which extends its influence
wherever faith is maintained and spreads. Pome belongs,
then, to the Head of the Church. Should she slip away
from that august power, she would at once lose all her
prestige; Pome with a tribune, orators, writers, a secular
Government, and a Prince at the Vatican, would be nothing
more than a town. Liberty would disinherit her. After
having given laws to the whole world, she can only retain
her greatness by commanding souls. The Poman Senate
has no other compensation worthy of it but the Vatican.
? History, religion, politics, justify, then, completely a
derogation from the regular and normal conditions of the
life of peoples. Nothing more simple, more legitimate, and
more essential than the Pope throning at Rome and pos-
sessing a limited territory. To satisfy so high an interest it
is fully permitted to withdraw some hundred thousand souls


from the life of nations, without, however, sacrificing them,
and giving them guarantees of welfare and social protection.
The Government of the Pope must be paternal in its ad-
ministration as it is by its nature. He who calls himself
the Holy Father ought to be a father for all his subjects.
If his institutions are beyond the principles which guaran-
tee the rights of government in a political society, his acts
ought to be only the more irreproachable, and when he can-
not be imitated by any one he will be the envy of all men.
We look, therefore, upon the temporal Government of the
Pope as the image of the Government of the Church. It is
a Pontificate, and not a Dictatorship. The large develop-
ment of his municipal area relieving him from the re-
sponsibility of administrative interests, he can maintain
himself in a sphere far above the management of affairs.
A member of the Italian Confederation, he is protected by
the Federal army. A Pontifical army ought not to be more
than an emblem of public order. When enemies are to be
fought, either at home or abroad, it is not the Head of the
Church to draw the sword. Bloodshed in his name seems
an insult to Divine mercy, which he represents ; when he
raises his hand it ought to be to bless, and not to strike.
? Another very important point is that the Catholic reli-
gion does not remain exclusively at the charge of the sub-
jects of the Pontifical Government. The Pope is the spiritual
Sovereign of all his flock ; it would not be equitable that
the necessary expenses to maintain the splendour which
appertains to the Majesty of the Head of the Church should
be supported by the population of his States. It is for the
Catholic Powers to provide the means which concern them
all by a large tribute paid to the Holy Father. His budget
will thus not be exclusively Homan, and will be interna-
tional, like his authority, which in a religious point of view
is recognized and respected everywhere where the dogma
which he represents is the law of consciences. In this man-
ner a double result, equally precious, will be maintained.
On the one hand, the Pope will find in the tribute of the
Catholic Powers a new proof of the universality and unity
of the moral power which he exercises; and, on the other,
he will not be obliged to press upon his people by taxes
which would not fill his treasury except by throwing dis-
credit on his name.
?In short, there will be a people in Europe who will be
ruled less by a King than by a father, and whose rights will
be guaranteed rather by the heart of the Sovereign than by
the authority of the laws and institutions. This people will
have no national representation, no army, no press, no ma-
gistracy. The whole of i�s political existence will be limited


to its municipal organization. Beyond that narrow circle
it will have no other resource than contemplation, the arts,
the study of ruins (la culture des mines), and prayer. He
will be for ever disinherited of that noble portion of activity
which in every country is the stimulus of patriotism and
the legitimate exercise of the faculties of the mind of su-
perior characters. Under the Government of the Sovereign
Pontiff there can be no aspiration either to the glory of the
soldier or the triumphs of the orator or of the statesman. It
will be the Government of peace and reflection?a sort of
oasis where the passions and interests of politics will not
trespass, and which will only have the sweet and calm con-
templations of a spiritual world.
? Doubtless, there is in this exceptional condition some-
thing painful for men who feel within them noble ambitions
to serve and raise themselves by merit, and who are con-
demned to inaction. It is a sacrifice which must be asked
from them in a higher order of interests, before which private
interests must fall. Moreover, if the subjects*of the Pope
are deprived of a political existence, they will be indemnified,
on the other hand, by a most paternal Government, by the
exemption from taxation, by the moral greatness of their
country, which is the centre of the Catholic faith, and by
the presence of a Court, the brilliancy of which, necessary
for the Double Majesty of the Pontiff? and of the Prince,
will be maintained by the means of liberal tributes paid by
the Catholic Powers of Europe. These considerations have
surely some value, and, after all, under such a system, with
such advantages, and with the chance of having great
Popes, such as history records, it will always be an honour
to call oneself a Homan citizen ?civis Romanus.
? Necessity of maintaining the temporal power of the
Pope ;
? Necessity of divesting it as much as possible of all the
responsibilities incumbent upon a Government, and of
placing the Head of the Church in a sphere where his spi-
ritual authority can neither be shackled nor compromised
by his political authority ;
? Necessity, to achieve this, of restricting instead of ex-
tending his territory, and of diminishing rather than in-
creasing the number of his subjects ;
?Necessity of giving to the population of these States,
thus deprived of the advantages of a political existence,
compensations by a paternal and economical administra-
tion :


? Such is in a few words the substance of what we have
endeavoured to demonstrate in the preceding pages.
? As consequence of this demonstration; another question
presents itself ?a delicate question; hut the solution of which
we imagine will become easier at the light of the princi-
ples we have laid down.
? The Romagna has been separated de facto for some
months from the authority of the Pope. It has been living
under a Provisional Government. It is actively ruled by a
Government whose powers extend over all the States of
Central Italy. Thus this separation hears for it all the
marks of a fait accompli.
? Is the Romagna to be restored to the Pope ?
? To resolve this question we do not wish to consult the
interests of the Papacy. As we have already said; it is in a
Catholic spirit that we write, we seek solely what may
he advantageous to the Church; to assure to its august Head
the security and grandeur which Prance, more than any
other nation, is hound to give him.
? Thus, it is hot our task here to study the interests of
the populations of the Romagna, the right they may have
to give themselves another form of Government, the com-
plaints which they raise against the Pontifical Administra-
tion, the sincerity more or less serious of the votes which
have pronounced the annexation to Piedmont ; ?this does
not come within our subject.
?Is it advisable, yes or no, for the glory of the Church,
for the authority of its Head, that the Romagna should be
restored to the patrimony of the Holy Father ? This is all
that we have to examine.
YII.
? The Romagna, despite the cession made of it hy
the Holy See in 1796, is a perfectly legitimate pos-
session of the Pontifical Government. The insur-
rection of its inhabitants against the Pope is thence a
revolt against legal right and against treaties. It is in
virtue of the treaties of 1815 that the Romagna, which
formed a part of the kingdom of Italy under the Empire,
was finally restored to the Pope. As long as those treaties
subsist it is incontestable that the Sovereign Pontiff is jus-
tified in asserting his claim, as he has done, to a portion of
his territory which has thrown off his sovereignty.
? But are the Papacy and religion interested in this claim ?
Here conscience hesitates, and its sentiment disagrees with
the rigorous interpretation of legal right. Is the Romagna,
which is a legitimate possession of the Holy See, a necessary
extension of his temporal authority? Hoes it bring him a


condition of power and security? If it were thus, there
would be no doubt; the question would be settled in the
opinion of all good Catholics.
?We ourselves are of the opinion that the separation
of the Romagna would not tend to diminish the temporal
power of the Pope. His territory, it is true, would be
diminished, hut his political authority, disencumbered of
a resistance which paralyzes it, would not be weakened, but
morally strengthened. For, let us repeat it, the authority of
the Head of the Church does not lie in the extent of a ter-
ritory which he cannot retain except by the support of
foreign arms, and in the number of subjects which he is
obliged to oppress to make them submit; it lies in the con-
fidence and respect which he inspires, and which relieve
him from having recourse to extreme measures of rigour
and constraint, bad for all Governments, but especially so
for a Prince who reigns Gospel in hand,
? What matters it, then, to the prestige, to the dignity,
to the greatness of the Sovereign Pontiff, the square miles
comprised in his States ? Hoes he want space to be beloved
and venerated ? Are not his benedictions and his teachings
the most powerful manifestation of his right ? Hoes he not
love and bless the whole universe ? Whether he rules over
few or many, that is not the question; what is essential is that
he should have a sufficient number of subjects to be inde-
pendent, and that he should not have too many to be carried
away by those,currents of passions, of interests, of novelties
which are produced everywhere where there are consider-
able agglomerations.
? The importance of the Pope does not consist in the 21
provinces which he actually possesses. Bologna, Ancona,
and Ravenna, separated from Rome by a chain of moun-
tains, the character of their inhabitants and historical sou-
venirs add nothing to the splendour of Rome. The Pope
throning at Rome, his seat at the Vatican, is what awes
(frappe) the world. The Sovereign of the Roman States is
scarcely thought of
?However, we grant that if the Romagna' belonged freely
to the Pope by the adhesion, the confidence, and attachment
of its population, as it belongs to him by the right of history
and by treaties, it could not be considered as an embarrass-
ment for him. Pacts prove that it is not so. Since the
treaties of 1815 that portion of the States of the Church has
not suffered less than 20 years of Austrian occupation,
Austria was still at Bologna when the flag of France appeared
on the Alps. It was its retreat which occasioned the depar-
ture of the Legate and the overthrow of the Papal
authority. Without Austria that power can neither be


restored nor maintained. All this, unhappily, is on incon-
trovertible evidence.
? By restoring the Romagna to the Holy Father it would
not be restoring to him respectful, submissive, and devoted
subjects, ready to obey his behests; it would be giving him
enemies of his power, resolved to resist him, and whom force
alone could keep under. What would the Church gain
thereby ? It would be obliged to see unfaithful sons
in rebellious subjects, and to excommunicate those it
ought to strike. To assert its Sovereignty it would, per-
haps, have to renounce its noblest title, that of Mother.
This is not what it desires. This is not what the Bishops
and the Catholics desire. A resumption of possession ac-
quired at such sacrifices would be a disaster, and not a
triumph. For some 100,000 inhabitants restored to the
temporal sway of the Pope, it would give a blow to his
spiritual authority from which the protection of God and
the wisdom of Europe will know how to protect it.
YIII.
? But this is not all. Let us take the impossible suppo-
sition that the Church does not fear this damage, and that
the Pope does not retreat before this extremity; let us sup-
pose that it is agreed to restore the Romagna to the Ponti-
fical Government, ?how is it to be done ? Is it by the voice
of persuasion and by good counsel ? But those means have
been exhausted. The Emperor of the French,who has con-
stantly defended the rights of the Holy See, has exercised
all his moral authority to calm the public mind in Central
Italy, and to reconcile the populations with their former
Governments. It has not succeeded, and its influence failed
before the impossible. There remains, then, but one
means?force.
? It is force only which can restore the Romagna to the
condition imposed upon it by treaties and by History. Can
it be employed ? And if employed, who is to be charged
with executing it ? Is it France ? Is it Austria ?
? An armed intervention to subjugate the Italians would
be the most fatal step for the late Governments, especially
for the Pontifical Government. Restorations effected by
foreign arms have never been successful; they have always
had to pay the penalty of their origin. When a Govern
ment is imposed upon a country by the stranger, it is never
accepted freely, and is nearly always violently overthrown,
? It is true that France reinstated Pius IX. at Rome.
It is already a misfortune for the Church that it was neces-
sary to have recourse to that extreme measure, and this is
evident from the necessity of prolonging the occupation


by our army. It must be added that Rome is in a situation
quite exceptionable, which traces her destiny. She is
destined by her past greatness to the position she occupies
since the establishment of the Papacy. She cannot escape
from it; her fate is settled (regie). It is the decree
of civilization, of history, and of God himself. Rut is
that which is necessary for Rome also possible for the
other cities of the Roman States? We do not think so, for
tho inconvenience of that intervention, already so consi-
derable as regards the metropolis of Catholicism, would be
far more serious if it became necessary to lay siege to every
town of the Legations. It would be the moral ruin of the
authority of the Sovereign Pontiff. Instead of reigning by
acknowledged right, and by the respect he inspires, he would
have to reign by force.
? Let us go still further, and ask who will be charged
with this restoration by force ? Would it be France ?
Would it be Austria?
? France ? Rut she cannot do it, A Catholic nation, she
would never consent to strike so serious a blow at the moral
power of Catholicism. A liberal nation, she could not com-
pel a people to submit to a Government which their will
rejects.
? Catholics who seek such a triumph for the Church ap-
pear to us as dangerous for it as y'ould be for the Monarchy
the Royalists who would dream of re-establishing the
ancient legitimacy by the aid of a new invasion.
?As regards compelling peoples, France is not used to
such work. When she meddled in their affairs it was to
enfranchise them, and not to oppress them. Under Louis
XYI. we went to the New World to help it to achieve its
nationality. Rclgium and the Uanubian Principalities arc
indebted to us for their political existence. It is not the
Emperor who could prove unfaithful to these generous
traditions.
? In Italy, more so than in any other country, France is
bound to uphold the principles of her liberal policy. France
has carefully avoided encouraging and recognizing the Go-
vernments de facto in Central Italy,?she has exhausted her
diplomatic efforts to reconcile the Princes with the popula-
tions ; but she cannot forget that those Governments
sprung into life the day Austria retreated. They arose from
a legitimate reaction against foreign occupation, and from
a noble outburst of nationality towards France, which came
to save the independence of the Peninsula.
? What has fallen at Rologna, as at Modena, at Parma,
and at Florence, is, then, not so much the authority of the


former Princes as the influence of Austria under which the
Princes had unhappily effaced the national character of
their sovereignty.
?It would certainly have been very desirable if what
has fallen from the reaction of the national sentiment so
long oppressed could be re-established under the guarantee
of reforms which had been promised. In giving her aid
thereto. Prance was acting up to her policy of moderation ;
but in doing more, by turning now against the Italian
people those victorious bayonets which six months ago pro-
tected it against Austria, she would be acting contrary to
all her principles. No man of common sense would give her
such advice.
? But, if France cannot intervene, let her allow Austria to
have her way. This is what the partisans of foreign inter-
vention in Italy say. And should we have run the risk of a
great war, gained four victories, lost 50,000 men, spent
300 millions, and shaken Europe, that Austria might on
the morrow of peace resume in the Peninsula the domina-
tion she exercised on the eve of her defeat ? Magenta and
Solferino should be simply trophies of contemporaneous
history ! Shall our soldiers have shed their blood for vain
glory? French heroism be sterile? No! no! French
policy does not harbour such inconsistencies and degra-
dations.
? The domination of Austria in Italy is at an end. This
is the grand result of our campaign, consecrated by the
peace of Yillafranca. For Austria to return to Florence,
to Parma, or to Bologna, it would be necessary to
admit that it was she who vanquished us. Let us
render justice to her honesty and common sense. She
does not pretend it, and those who in France make the
pretence for her forget at the same time what our principles
impose upon us, and what our honour prohibits us. Our
principles bid us leave Italy to herself, and respect the
sovereignty we have restored to her, on the condition that
she will know how to conciliate its rights with the equi-
librium of Europe. Our honour prohibits us from recog-
nizing the right of Austria to armed intervention, which
we do not admit for ourselves.
? France, then, cannot intervene for the re-establishment
of the temporal power of the Pope in the llomagna, and she
cannot allow Austria to have recourse to force to compel the
populations when she rejects its employment on her own
account.


? If neither France nor Austria intervene, whose arm is
it that will being back the Romagna under the Papal sway ?
Would it he that- of an Italian Power? There is
hut one Power to which such a task might appertain,?
Naples. But is that possible? The kingdom of the Two
Sicilies is labouring under a deep-set movement in the
public mind, which does not allow its Government to at-
tempt a diversion on the Abruzzi. It has need of all its
forces to meet dangers at home, and by provoking a
struggle it would incur the risk of a revolution. It
would be the greatest act of imprudence it could
commit to the prejudice of order, and especially to the
prejudice of the Holy See. If all the elements of revolu-
tionary combustion in the Peninsula have hitherto been
kept under, it must be attributed to the passive attitude of
the different factions, the hostile contact of which would
produce the spark that would set all Italy in a blaze.
Opposed to the King of Naples, the champion of absolutism,
would stand the King of Piedmont, the supporter of the
liberty of peoples. Civil war would have to decide, and
anarchy would fatally be the last word of so disastrous an
attempt.
? The armed intervention of Naples would'produce no-
thing but disasters if it were possible. But it is not pos-
sible, for it would be a manifest violation of the neutrality
imposed upon all the Italian States. In fact, if the Neapo-
litan army entered the States of the Church, nothing could
prevent the Piedmontese army from occupying Parma and
Tuscany. Such disorder would not only be the overthrow
of all international rules ; it would be, moreover, a revolt
against the jurisdiction of Europe, whose duty it is, while
respecting the right of Sovereignties, to watch over
the general order which concerns the safety of its equili-
brium.
? There is only one intervention that can be regular, effi-
cacious, and legitimate,?it is that of the whole of Europe,
united in a Congress to decide all the questions that affect
the modifications of territory or the revision of treaties.
? The competence of an European Congress is established
by the principles of international law. For the laws that
bind the people of different nations, as well as for those
which are obligatory on the citizens of the same State,
it is the twofold consecration of public interest, and general
assent that constitutes conventional right. Practice is in
accordance with the theory, and we know from history that


States have been formed, aggrandized, modified, and trans-
formed in virtue of treaties.
? It was the treaties of 1815 that determined the political
existence of Italy and its territorial divisions.
? The cession of Lombardy to France, who again ceded it
to Sardinia, was a special Act of the will of Austria, which
did not affect the organization of the independent States of
Italy, as they were constituted at the Congress of Vienna.
To alter the frontiers of these States, requires a reference
to the same jurisdiction that regulated them?that is to
say, to all the Powers who were parties to the treaties of
1815.
? This is what has been done by the reservation inserted
in the 19th Article of the Treaty of Zurich, the immediate
consequence of which is the appeal to an European Con-
gress that will meet on the sth of January.
? The Congress of Paris has full power to alter what was
settled by the Congress of Vienna. Europe, combined at
Vienna in 1815, gave the Romagna to the Pope ; Europe,
combined at Paris in 1860, may decide otherwise in regard
to it.
? And, let it be observed, the last decision, should it be
contrary to that of 1815, would not bear the same charac-
ter as the first .In 1815 the Powers disposed of the people
of Romagna ; in 1860, if they are not placed under the
authority of the Pope, the Powers of Europe only formally
record a fait accompli.
? The competence of the Congress, then, cannot be dis-
puted ; for, if it were now denied to be competent, it would
be necessary to declare that the Congress of Vienna, the
majority of which were representatives of great schismatic
Powers, had no right to dispose of the territory of Romagna
and its population in favour of the Pope.
?It may be said,perhaps,that the territory of the Pope is
indivisible; this is an error, contradicted by history. There
exists no territory that has undergone more changes and
vicissitudes than the Patrimony of St. Peter. Given by
Pepin to Pope Stephen 11., it reverted again to the
Empire, was contended for by rival claimants and was
not restored to the Holy See till the reign of Louis XII. It
was the same with the Legations, which, after many
struggles, were only annexed to the Roman States by Louis
de Gonzaga. Finally, in 1796, a Pope, Pius VI., signed at
Tolentino, a treaty that ceded to France, in perpetuity, for
him and his successors Bologna, Ferrara, and the Romagna.
The Pope equally renounced any rights he might have
possessed over the cities and territories of Avignon, and the


Yenaissin comte that now forms the department of Van-
cluse.
?In fact, in 1791, Avignon, which had rebelled against
the Pope?s Legate, demanded to be united to France, and an
Act of the Constituent Assembly effected this annexation,
which was only recognized by the Pope in the Treaty of
Tolentino.
?Now, either the territory of the Church, as some main-
tain, is an inalienable and indivisible patrimony that may
not be touched ; in which case, the sovereignty over the
Department of Yaucluse, ought to be restored to the Pope;
or else this territory is, like all others, liable to changes,
and then it is permitted to pious, but independent minds, to
discuss its more or less of extent. It is well known that
nothing compels a Pope to cede it; and it is before the most
redoubtable force that his weakness is most invincible,
when it has right for its protection.
? The territory of the Papal States, therefore, is no more
indivisible than its extent is invariable. Like all posses-
sions, this one is subjected to the influence of events; it
is extended or diminished, according as its interests and
the general necessities of policy impose changes upon it.
In this respect nothing is exempted. Only the spiritual
authority of the Pope is immutable, like the truths it re-
presents and the doctrines it teaches. As to the temporal
authority allied to the other, it, by a superior principle,
necessarily remains subjected to all the conditions of human
things. To endow with a divinity that which is only hu-
man would be to lower the power that is Divine, and give
the character of eternity to institutions as mutable and
fluctuating as the accidents, the changes,and the progress
of society,
? All the reasons that are brought forward to impeach
the competence of the Congress, and fetter its freedom of
action, are therefore valueless, Europe, which, in 1815,
could sacrifice Italy, can, in 1860, emancipate and save her.
The right of acting is the same; the only question is its
better application.
? As to the special objection that the majority of the
great Powers being schismatic, they are by that fact alone
rendered incompetent to deprive the Pope of one of his
provinces, we reply?since these same Powers in 1815 gave
them to the Pope, they have certainly the right to con-
sider whether they can or cannot leave them in his posses
sion in 1860.
? What is to be done in the actual position of affairs to
conciliate interests that appear irreconcilable?
? Two extreme parties arc opposed to each other?one


wishes to deprive the Pope of everything, the other to
give him all. They are two hypotheses equally inadmissible,
and both, though radically contrary to each other, would
have the same result for the Papacy.
?We believe there is another course that may be
taken. First, we wish that the Congress should re-
cognise as an essential principle of European order, the
necessity of the temporal power of the Pope. That is for
us the chief point. The principle here appears to us to
have more value than the territorial possession, more or less
extensive, that will be its natural consequence. As for this
territory itself, the city of Rome includes all that is most im-
portant in it; the rest is only secondary. The city of Rome
and the Patrimony of St. Peter must be guaranteed to 'the
Sovereign Pontiff by the great Powers, with a considerable
revenue, that the Catholic States will pay, as a
tribute of respect and protection to the Head of
the Church. An Italian Militia, chosen from the
elite of the Federal army, should assure the tran-
quility and inviolability of the Holy See. Municipal liber-
ties, as extensive as possible, should release the Papal
Government from all the details of administration, and thus
give a share of public local life to those who are disinherited
of political activity. Finally, every complication, every
idea of war and of revolt, must be for ever banished from
the territory governed by the Pope, that it may be said,
where reigns the Vicar of Christ, there also reign well-
being, concord, and peace.
? It is the task of the Congress to effect this transforma-
tion, become necessary to consolidate the temporal authority
of Rome. As we have before said, this consolidation is ab-
solutely connected with the interests of Europe. As a
temporal and divine institution, the Papacy has nothing to
fear from men; it is eternal. As a political institution it
is exposed to all the trials and calamities that impend
over all human things. Well! it is important to the
security and honour of all that it should not be attacked in
the constitution it has received from time and history.
Catholic or schismatic, the great Powers have the same
interest, for the independence of the Head of the Church is
not only a question of consience and religion ; it is also a
guarantee of the moral equilibrium of the world. This great
cause, therefore, cannot be indifferent to any one; and we
know no cause more worthy of the arbitration of those who
are called on to judge it.
?Of what avail are any illusions ? By a combination of
many circumstances, by a succession of causes that go far
back into history, the temporal power of the Pope is


seriously menaced in the conditions under which it is now
exercised. It is a great calamity, which we deplore from
the bottom of our hearts; but it is also a great danger,
which it is the duty of all?men of the world and religious
nlen alike?to lessen, for the good of the Church as for the
interests of Europe. The Holy See is placed on a
volcano, and the Pontiff, who is charged by God to
maintain peace in the world, is himself constantly
threatened with a revolution. He, the august representa-
tive of the highest moral authority on earth, can only main-
tain himself by the protection of foreign armies. These
military occupations only protect him by compro-
mising him. They excite against him all the susceptibilities
of the national feeling. They prove that he cannot rely on
the love and respect of his people.
?It is a deplorable position that only blindness and im-
prudence can wish to prolong, but which enlightened and
respectful attachment requires should be changed as soon as
possible. The change is both necessary and urgent, and
only the declared enemies or blind friends of the Papacy
can resist it. The question is not that of diminishing the
patrimony of St. Peter, but of saying it.
?When France declared itself in favour of Italy this
great interest, the safety of the Papacy, was certainly one
of the most serious preoccupations of the policy of its Sove-
reign. The Emperor Napoleon saw that the tem-
poral power of the Pope, restored in 1849, and since
protected by his arms, was gravely menaced in the
conditions of its political existence. He saw that it was
necessary to save the Papacy in emancipating Italy. God
has blessed his enterprise, and has given him the victory ;
but his glory would be sterile if, in giving its nationality to
a people, he did not assure to the Church its security and
independence.
?The Emperor Napoleon 1., by the Concordat with Rome,
reconciled a new society and the faith. With the genius
of a statesman, and the conscience of an honest man, he raised
the altar and restored a worship in this noble France, hu-
miliated by the scepticism, and degraded by the anarchy,
which, at a period of madness, called itself the goddess
Reason.
? May his heir have the honour in his turn to reconcile
the Pope, as temporal Sovereign, with his subjects and
his age ! This is what all hearts sincerely Catholic ought
to ask of Heaven.?
