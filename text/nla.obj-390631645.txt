SHEEP AND WOOL
The suitability of the land discovered in New South Wales for Land suited
pastoral pursuits was undoubtedly the means of leading the infant iSit\ ial
Colony to take its first step on the path of commercial progress ;
and it is not a little surprising at this distance of time how steadily
some of the settlers, in the face of the almost insurmountable
difficulty of transport which existed a century ago, availed them-
selves of the opportunities at their disposaj. The importation of
valuable specimens of sheep from England or the Cape of Good
Hope, prior to the introduction of steam, was at all times attended
with great risk, and it frequently happened that many of these
costly animals died during the tedious voyage. These enterprises
were, however, on the whole successful, and thus the flocks and
herds of the colonists surely, if at first slowly, increased and
multiplied.
By the year 1795, Captain Macarthur, one of the first promo- Captain

flock of 1,000, which were held in great estimation, and gradually
increased in value, until, as recorded by an entry in his journal ten
years later, the market price of a fat wether had risen to £5. Not
satisfied with the natural increase of his flocks, Macarthur sought
to improve the quality of his fleeces, by which means he could see
opening before him the promise of great wealth, and the prospect
of establishing important commercial relations with Gfeat Britain.
With these ends in view, he procured from the Cape of Good
Hope, at great cost and trouble, a number of superior rams and
ewes. A happy circumstance occurred which favoured his enter-
prise ; for he had the good fortune to secure possession of three
rams and five ewes of very fine Spanish breed, which had been
presented by the King of Spain to the Dutch Government. These
animals, out of a total of twenty-nine purchased at the Cape,

arrived in Sydney in 1797, and were disposed of to various
breeders. With the exception of Macarthur, however, those who
had secured sheep of the superior breed made no attempt to
follow up the advantage, being probably amply satisfied with the
larger gains from the sale of an increased number of animals.
o o
Macarthur, on the other hand, thought little of present profits,
and still less of breeding entirely for human consumption. He
attentively watched the results of crossing his imported rams with
the old stock, and by systematically selecting the finer ewes which
were the offspring, for further mingling with the sires, he gradually
improved the strain, and in a few years obtained fleeces of very
fine texture which met with the ready appreciation of English
manufacturers. It has been asserted that Macarthur was not the
first to introduce merino sheep into Australia; but whether this
be so or not, there is no doubt that to him is due the credit of
having been the first to prove that the production of fine wool
could be made a profitable industry in this Colony.
Prior to the present century the production of the finest wool
had been confined chiefly to Spain, and woollen manufactures
were necessarily carried on in England upon a somewhat limited
scale, which was not likely to improve in face of certain restric-
tions the operatives endeavoured to place upon their employers.
These men, in support of their contention that the woollen
trade could not be expanded, on account of the limited supply
of the raw material, argued that fine wool was obtainable only
in Spain; and it was at this favourable period that Macarthur
arrived in England with specimens of the wool obtained from his
finest sheep, conclusively proving the capabilities of Australia as
wool-producing country. In this way he opened up a small
trade with English manufacturers, which, as Australasian wool rose
in public estimation, gradually increased until it reached its pre-
sent enormous dimensions. During his visit to England, Macarthur
purchased an additional stock of ten rams and ewes of the noted
Spanish breed, nearly equal in quality to those which in 1797 he


had procured from the Cape of Good Hope. These sheep were
purchased by Lieut. Waterhouse at the Cape, and some of them
after their arrival in Sydney were sold to Captain Macarthur,
others were sold to Captain Cox and the Rev. Samuel Marsden.
The remainder Lieut. Waterhouse reserved to himself for breeding
purposes. That these animals were the finest obtainable in
Europe may be gathered from the fact they also had formed
portion of a present from the King of Spain to George 111.
Thus did Macarthur, after his return to New South Wales,
patiently continue for many years the process of selection, with
such success, that in 1858, when his flock was finally dispersed,
it was estimated that his superior ewes numbered fully 1,000.
Victoria secured a considerable portion of Macarthur’s flock, and
the process of breeding proceeded simultaneously in that and other
adjacent Colonies.
Although the increase in the numbers of the finer sheep was importation
. . . . . _ of sheep.
satisfactory, the importation of superior stock was not discontinued,
and the stock of the Colonies was augmented in 1823 and 1825
by the further introduction of Spanish sheep. Sheep-breeding
was about this period commenced in the Mudgee district, and the
climate of that region has produced a still more favourable result
upon the quality of the fleeces than any other part of the Colony,
and it is thence that the finest merinos are now procured. Numbers Texture of wool
of high-class merinos are also annually received from Tasmania
for stud purposes. As might have been anticipated, the climate
of Australia has in some respects changed the character of the
Spanish fleece. The wool has become softer and more elastic, and
while having diminished in density it has increased in length, so
that the weight of the fleece has only slightly altered. The
quality of the wool has thus on the whole improved under the
beneficial influence of the climate, and if no further enhancement
in its value can be reasonably hoped for, there is at least every
reason to believe that Australasian wool will maintain its present
high standard of excellence.

that the rate of increase in any year should be about 20 per cent.,
so that the flocks of the Colony would increase two-fold in about
four years. Actual experience shows that such rate of increase
was only approached once since the year 1861. During the period
of five years from 1861 to 1866 there was a two-fold increase; the
flocks of the Colony were again doubled in the eight years from
1866 to 1874 and in the thirteen years from 1874 to 1887. How
many sheep could be sustained by the Colony under a system of
artificial feeding and watering may hereafter become a question of
national interest, but it is abundantly plain that even with a
continuation of fair seasons it would be impossible, under the
present mode of depasturing stock, for the Colony to support for any
number of years an increase of sheep similar to the record of even
1891, as in six years’ time the flocks would number 120,000,000, a
total nearly as large as that now found in all Australasia.
The export and import of sheep during the ten years, 1882-
1891, is shown in the following table :

the Colony. Such, however, is
not now the case, and the annual demand for slaughtering pur-
poses is about 6 per cent, of the number of sheep depastured, and
is, therefore, equal to three-sevenths of the annual cast.
The stock-carrying capabilities of the Colony are very difficult
to estimate, as by far the greater portion of the country is yet
in its natural state. Improvements, such as a better system of
water conservation and irrigation, an intelligent extension of the
salt-bush, cotton-bush, and other drought-resisting shrubs and


natural grasses, and the cultivation of artificial fodder, are
gradually being effected, and will indefinitely extend the capacity
of the Colony for supporting stock of all descriptions.

It will be seen that New South Wales stands first of all the Colony stands
first as shcep-
colonies as a sheep-breeding country, both as regards the number breeder,
of its flocks, and the number of sheep depastured per unit of area.
But whilst Victoria has nearly reached the limit of its natural
capabilities in this particular direction, a considerable proportion
of its area being now devoted to agriculture, New South Wales has
not yet approached these limits. In Queensland, as in South
Australia, sheep-breeding does not absorb the attention of pastoral-
ists to the same extent that it does in New South Wales. The
former colony is more adapted to the breeding of cattle ; whilst in 103
the southern and more settled districts of South Australia greater catt!e-
attention is paid to the cultivation of cereals, its northern terri-
tory, like that of Queensland, being more adapted by nature to
the breeding of cattle and horses. Western Australia is at present
in the early stage of its colonisation; much of its area is still
unknown, and it is therefore impossible to estimate its future as
a sheep-breeding country. It may, however, be surmised that the
southern portion of its immense territory will, in time to come,
be stocked with sheep, whilst the northern portion will probably
be found more suitable for the breeding of cattle and horses, on

account of its resemblance to portions of Queensland and the
northern territory of South Australia situated under the same
latitude. It was thought at one time that cattle-breeding would
occupy a position in New South Wales equal to that of sheep-
breeding, but experience has shown that the general climatic
conditions are more favourable to sheep than to cattle, and the
Colony is probably destined to remain, as it now is, the great
sheep-breeding centre of Australia.
The different degrees of success attending sheep farming in
different parts of the country has long since directed attention to
the fact that each part of Australia is not equally fitted for the
production of fine wools. New South Wales may be divided
climatically into four zones : —(1) The coast country extending
from the seaboard to the main range, the breadth of which varies
from 20 to 100 miles ; (2) the table-land districts on the summit
of the range; (3) the upper part of the western slopes; and (4)
the interior, or “salt-bush country.”
The climate of the eastern seaboard for a considerable distance
inland is too moist, and a large portion of it too poor, for the
adequate sustenance of merinos, but it is probable that the coarser
breeds of sheep would not deteriorate through the limited food
supply and the rugged nature of the country. On the Hunter
and other northern rivers, and in the southern coast districts,
where the soil is very rich, dairy-farming and agriculture are the
leading, and, no doubt, the most profitable, industries. Sheep-
breeding is carried on to some extent in the regions towards the
summit of the coast range ; but, as in the case of the country
near the sea, the soil as a rule is unfavourable to sheep. On
crossing the coast range, however, the contrast between the
aspect of the country just entered, and that left behind, is very
striking. Here the grazing and wool-growing capabilities are at
once apparent, and further to the westward a still greater improve-
ment is visible.
In the abundant pastures of the Riverine disti’icts the wool is
less fine than in the country immediately west of the table-lands,
but the fleeces are generally sound and heavy. Further in the
salt-bush wool suffers both in the weight of the fleece


and in its quality ; but the country is fattening, and the stock are
generally more healthy than those nearer the sea. In the country
on the further side of the Darling the great summer heat is adverse
to the production of heavy fleeces; but even here a fair class of
wool is produced, as the stock-owners are constantly introducing
fresh blood, and so counteracting the tendency towards the
degeneration of the breed of sheep which might otherwise ensue.

I ranee, (Germany, and America, which was continued for many
years after the superfine quality of Australian wool had been estab-
lished in the markets of the world, practically ceased even before
importation was legally prohibited; for it had become apparent
that the fleece, instead of showing signs of deterioration under the
influence of the climate, had, on the whole, a tendency to improve.
The introduction of sheep and cattle into New South Wales was
forbidden for many years, owing entirely to the fear of the
stock-owners that their herds would be contaminated by scab and
other diseases prevalent in European flocks ; but these restrictions
were removed at the beginning of the year 1888, and 432 pure
bred sheep, comprising 354 American merino, 60 German merino,
and 18 English stud sheep arrived in 1891, in addition to 14,026
stud sheep from other parts of Australasia.
It is now generally admitted that as far as the fleece is con-Superiority of

cerned the Australian merino has little to gain by any further
admixture of European or American blood, but it is equally
admitted that there is room for improvement in the physique of
the animal. To produce a larger carcase, without interfering with
the quality of the fleece, many experiments have been made, but
without much success, and it has been found that the crossing of
noted breeds of English rams with Australian ewes has invariably
resulted, after a generation or two, in a deterioration of the merino.
The breeding of sheep for consumption, and for the sake of the
wool, has, therefore, developed naturally into two distinct fields of
industry. It may here be mentioned that the carcass of the
ordinary Australian merino when dressed averages about 46-|- lb.,
whereas dressed carcases of the Lincoln or Leicester breed would
average 57 to 60 lb.

The advantages of the paddocking system are now universally
recognized ; the country will carry one-third more sheep ; the wool
will be longer and sounder, and the fleece as a whole one-third
better; the feed will be cleaner and less liable to grass-seed ; the
lambing on the average of years will be better ; the sheep will
increase in size, they will live longer and continue longer profit-
able ; they will be freer from foot-rot and other diseases; the
expense of working the station will be less than a quarter of what
it would be if the sheep were shepherded; and finally, the owner
will be able to devote the principal part of his time to improving
his sheep, instead of spending it in attempting to manage a
number of shepherds and hut-keepers.

The number of ewes at the close of 1890 was 25,373,440 ; but Lambs marked,
allowing for deaths from natural causes, slaughtering, and export,
the number at the time of lambing was probably not more than
23,343,000. A percentage of 69, as estimated by the Chief
Inspector of Stock, would give a total of 16,107,000 lambs, while
the number marked, as shown by the Live Stock returns, was
14,690,026. When due allowance is made for deaths between the
time of lambing and of marking, it will be found that the estimate
of the Chief Inspector is very accurate.
WOOL.
The quantity of wool exported, the produce of New South New gonth
Wales, during 1870 and subsequent periods ending with 1891, is ported.'' 00 '
given in the subjoined table. A large proportion of the clip is
exported to Europe via the adjacent colonies as already alluded to
in the chapter on Commerce. During 1870 nearly 46 per cent, of
New South Wales wool was shipped from ports outside the Colony,
but in 1891 the proportion had declined to about 28 per cent.
The weights given are on the assumption that all the wool was
shipped in grease :

As the season for exporting wool does not wholly fall within
the calendar year, the quantities of wool stated in the foregoing
table for any year refer partly to that year, and partly to the
previous one. The following table shows the total number of
sheep shorn, and distinguishes those whose fleece was washed pre-
vious to shearing. It will be observed that there has been a
marked tendency to shear in grease, owing no doubt to the fact
that freights are now much lower than formerly. Besides, the
price obtained for washed wool in excess of greasy is not com-
mensurate with the cost of washing :

finer class than ordinary :

a large measure depends upon the state of the wool market.

An examination of the preceding figures at once shows how
greatly the fluctuations in the value of the staple article of export
affect the national prosperity. The exports for the years 1884 and
1886, for instance, which may be taken as practically equal in
quantity, represented a value of £8,953,100 iu the former year,
whilst in the latter year the value was reduced to £7,028,596
Again, comparing 1883 with 1891, there was a difference in quan
tity in favour of the latter year of 123,355,000 lb. of wool weighed
in the grease, and had the prices of 1883 been obtained the value
of the 1891 clip would have exceeded that of the former year bv
£5,401,134, whereas the excess was only £1,437,257. The general
strike of 1890, so frequently alluded to in these pages, had a very
marked effect on the wool trade of the succeeding year. In some


cases during 1890 the sheep remained unshorn until long after the
usual time, and in many others the wool did not leave the stations
until the close of the year, so that a considerable portion of the
wool clip of 1890 was of necessity held over for export in the suc-
ceeding year.
The preceding table also shows that, although during the period F | uetuation in
under examination the value of wool has greatly fluctuated from value-
one year to another, the tendency to a settled diminution of price
is unfortunately too clearly discernible. In order to further
illustrate the fluctuations in the value of this staple in the London
market during the last twelve years, the following table will give
an accurate idea of the average value realised for greasy wool.
The values given were those ruling at the five principal sales of
each year, and have been altered for 1890 and previous years since
last publication.

per lb. Prices were fairly well maintained till 1883, but they
began to decline rapidly until the lowest market was reached in
the second series of 1886, when greasy wool realised as little
as 6d. per. lb., but at the end of that year the prices had consider-
ably advanced, greasy wool selling at lOd. These prices have
been exceeded only once since, which was at the December sales
of 1889, when the price obtained for greasy was ll|d. Since
1889 the price of greasy wool ranged from 10|d. at the beginning
of that year, to B|d. at the fifth series of 1891, The first sales
of 1892 opened at the last mentioned price, but after that period
a continual decline took place, till in June greasy wool was only

unfavourable season of 1886. The average price per bale for the
last seven years was £l 4, while the price obtained during the
last half of 1891 was only £l2 ss. The unsatisfactory state of
the markets is principally attributed to the general financial
depression, exclusive tariffs, and increased production.

circumstances pass away, but a return to the extremely prosperous
years of 1871 to 1875, or even those of 1880 and 1882 is very
doubtful. But even with the present markets there is no
cause to view unfavourably the further extension of the produc-
tion of wool in these colonies. In the ancient seats of wool
growing, production is now stationary, and in some of the areas
recently devoted to this industry, many causes, both climatic and
otherwise, are likely to offer serious checks to its extension, while
population and the consequent demand for wool is everywhere
increasing. Nevertheless, it seems certain that unless fresh avenues
are open to the wool industry in those countries where its use is
comparatively unknown, it would be hopeless to expect a marked
rise in the value of the article. The establishment of a market

Wales is more adapted to the production of a combing than a
clothing wool. Although the former is looked upon with most
favour by wool growers, it is generally recognised that there are
very large tracts of country, especially where the salt-bush pre-
dominates, on which it is difficult to raise a good combing wool,
and where it will probably be found more profitable by wool
growers to give greater attention to the cultivation of the clothing
variety.

stock raised for this purpose are principally of the Leicester and
Lincoln breeds, the latter being perhaps the greater favourite as
a producer of fat lambs. There is no doubt but that, cultivated
solely as an article of food, the coai’se-woolled sheep is quite as
profitable as the merino.
