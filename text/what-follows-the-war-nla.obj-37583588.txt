WHAT FOLLOWS THE WAR.
This World Can Never be the
Same Again After This War
THE LAST YEARS OF THE NATIONS RULE.
A GREAT DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONS IS COMING SHORTLY—(AS
IN NOAH’S TIME)—“AND THE CITIES OF THE NATIONS FELL"
(WILL FALL IN THIS CENTURY.) SEE REVELATIONS, C. 16, V. 19.
PEACE, QUIETNESS, AND PROSPERITY AS WE HAD BEFORE THIS
WAR WILL NOT COME AGAIN. IT HAS GONE FOREVER,
WHILE MAN’S GOVERNMENT REMAINS.
A SHORT, UNEASY, TROUBLED PEACE WILL FOLLOW THIS WAR,
THEN WAR AGAIN, WORSE THAN EVER BEFORE—NOT FROM
GERMANY, BUT FROM RUSSIA AND THE NEAR EAST.
SEE PARAGRAPH 57.
THIS IS OF TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE TO EVERY MAN AND
WOMAN, FOR IT VITALLY CONCERNS EVERY ONE OF US.
The Coming Final Crisis in this World’s Affairs.
THIS CENTURY is the LAST TIME of the NATIONS’ RULE. ALL
MAN’S GOVERNMENTS will come TO AN END WITHIN THE NEXT FEW
YEARS. We are living in the End of the 6th Age. God’s six days.
1. BUSINESS MAN! AND ALL MEN AND WOMEN! Your EARNEST
ATTENTION is wanted here. You MUST SPARE TIME from the CLOSE
ATTENTION and DEVOTION you give to YOUR WORLDLY AFFAIRS and
the WORSHIP OF YOUR BUSINESS to ATTEND to THIS BUSINESS NOW.
Tins is THE business of our life and it is what we are here for., Elvery
thought and energy and concentration you give to your worldly business by
day and night, which is only very temporary, and cannot last, and it will not
profit you in the next life, but no time or thought is given to your business
with your Creator, Almighty God. How do you suppose He is going to
tolerate that? God tells us plainly, “He will make a SHORT work” of man’s
evil ways. “He will cut it short in Righteousness” (Romans, 9-28).


2. TAKE AN INTEREST AND MAKE ADD ENQUIRIES, AND GET ADD
THE INFORMATION you can on this subject and don’t neglect it; it is of
DESPERATE importance. THESE TIMES are exceedingly DANGEROUS.
Mankind has never been in SUCH DEADDY PERID through NEGLECTING
GOD, living APART from Him, and DEFYING His commands, SINCE MAN-
KIND WERE DESTROYED by the FLOOD IN NOAH’S TIME for THE VERY
SAME THING. For they treated the warnings as IDLE TALES like the
people of this age.
3. God help the people! What are they thinking about, that the SIGNS
and MEANINGS of THESE days have NO EFFECT upon them? They go
about as complacently and confidently and securely as if the world in its present
stale is going to last for ever, and no RECKONING DAY is in store. In their
self-conceit and blindness they THINK MANKIND will IMPROVE himself and
GET BETTER, entirely ignoring THE MANY WARNINGS from God that
MAN WILL GET WORSE and WORSE, until God Himself intervenes to put
a complete stop to Man’s evil ways for ever. Men must think this MATTER
OUT.
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE EVENTS AND SIGNS OF
THESE TIMES?
4. INCREASING DEVASTATING WAR, GREAT COMMERCIAL
TROUBLES, EARTHQUAKES, LABOR and CAPITAL UPHEAVALS,
FINANCIAL TROUBLES, STRIKES, AGREEMENT and TRUCE
BREAKERS, TRAITORS, FIERCE, Etc. (See Timothy, C. 3, V. 2-3), all in
THESE LAST DAYS. “DISTRESS OF NATIONS, men’s hearts failing them
for fear of what is cominer on earth.” (Mark. c. 13; Luke, c. 21, v. 25.)
EIGHT TERRIBLE WARS SINCE THIS CENTURY—I9OO—STARTED.
1. Boer War.
2. Italian-Turkish-Tripoli War.
3. Russo-Japanese W r ar.
4. Mexican War.
5. Bulgarian-Turkish War.
C. Greek, Servian, and Bulgarian War.
7. Austro-Servian War.
S. The Greatest War of the Nations—The German War.
FIVE TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKES SINCE 1900.
1. Martinique, 1902.
2. San Francisco, 1906.
3. Messina, 1908.
4. Japanese, 1911
j 5. Italian, 1914.
5. “The awakening of the EASTERN NATIONS, so that the KINGS OF
THE EAST, Japan, China, etc., shall come in and take their part in the
FINAL great smash and war of the nations that is soon to come after this
war and a short peace.” See Revelations, ch. 16, verse 12.
“AT THE TIME OF THE END” '
6. "MEN shall MOVE RAPIDLY to and fro (in the air, and on land and
sea), and KNOWLEDGE SHALL BE INCREASED in the LAST DAYS.”
THESE DAYS. See Daniel, ch. 12, verse 4.
NAHUM’S CHARIOTS.
7. “The CHARIOTS shall rage and JOSTLE one against another in the
STREETS and Broadways. They shall seem like FLAMING TORCHES.
They shall RUN like the lightnings (motor cars, trains, etc.) in THE DAY of
GOD’S PREPARATION.” THESE DAYS. See Nahum, ch. 2, verse 3 and 4.
WHAT MORE EVIDENCE DO PEOPLE WANT THAN THIS?


8. .These ARK signs ENOUGH SURELY, to make any man think that
something is coming. To support this, read Matthew, ch. 24, verse 21, 22,
36, 37, 38, 39; Mark, ch. 13, verse 19, to end of chapter Luke, ch. 21, verse 9.
to end of chapter. Our Lord warns us, “As it was in the days of Noah, they
builded, they planted, they traded, they feasted, they married wives, they
heeded not the warnings of the prophets of the impending destruction, and
the flood came and destroyed all but THK FEW righteous and believing—
eight persons.” So it shall be in THIS PRESENT CENTURY, “for Christ
shall come in FLAMING FIRE, and BY FIRE shall all the DISBELIEVERS,
NEGLECTERS, and those who DEFY GOD and His COMMANDS be destroyed
in this world, and be in terrible trouble in the next wmrld.”
9. It is no use saying you DO NOT BELIEVE these things, or have NO
TIME TO ATTEND TO THESE MATTERS; you MUST MAKE TIME, for
it is God’s time you are using, and He will REQUIRE it of you. Our worldly
business is only temporary, but this is our Eternal business. Don’t spend all
your time, thought, and energy upon your Worldly business.
10. The People in Noah’s time treated the Prophecies and Warnings of
Noah and the other Prophets, Enoch, Lamech, Methuselah, who wrote books
warning the people of what was to come (see Book of Enoch) as idle tales,
myths and fables, and it was “business and pleasure with them as usual.” like it
is with the people of this age, and the trouble and destruction came upon them
unexpectedly like this great war came upon us suddenly. So shall it be in
the final Great YVar and destruction that is coming upon the world in THIS
century. Note:—One third of the Scriptures consists of Prophecies. If we
neglect them it is at our peril. For they have an exact time limit.
If this does not set people thinking hard and enquiring into these things,
nothing will.
11. Don’t destroy this Pamphlet. Keep it by you. Watch the coming
events. If no one tells you or warns you about these things, how are you
going to know unless you study them yourself from the Scriptures, and so
prepare ?
12. Never have any people had so many warnings given them. Never were
books and pamphlets and TRACTS AND BIBLES SO PLENTIFUL as they
are in this age, and never were people more CARELESS and HEEDLESS in
considering these matters than to-day. Many will not LISTEN, NOR READ,
NOR BE TOLD, NOR STUDY the literature dealing with these all-important
facts.
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THAT THESE
PROPHECIES REFER TO THESE DAYS AND TIMES
"We have a more SURE word of Prophecy unto which ye do WELL to take
heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.” See 2nd Peter, c. 1, v. 19.
Awake! Awake! Awake!
A STIRRING MESSAGE. AN URGENT WARNING.
YOU MUST ATTEND TO THIS.
We are taking things TOO EASY these times. All Men and Women MUST
be AROUSED, CONCERNED. ALARMED and AWAKENED to the
SERIOUSNESS and PERIL of THESE TIMES.
13. ALL the Prophets, ALL the words and WARNINGS of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, ALL the Signs and ALL the indications of things around us, POINT
to THIS age. and MOST PARTICULARLY THIS CENTURY, as being the
END of the TIMES of the Gentile Nations, and the LAST of the TIMES of
ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS. EMPIRES, KINGDOMS, and REPUBLICS
when, as FORE’T’OLD. they shall be BROKEN TO PIECES for ever, and


ONE Universal Kingdom embracing all Nations shall be set up, with Christ in
PERSON, as Lord and Ruler, and King of Kings, reigning at Jerusalem, and
ruling All Nations with a Rod of Iron, namely, with Firmness and Justice, and
Peace. (See Rev., c. 2, v. 27.) Never since the time of JONAH was a GREAT
PROPHET so much NEEDED as TO-DAY, to warn all Nations of the frightful
trouble coming, and calling them to a QUICK REPENTANCE for their evil
ways, and continual violence, wickedness and corruption. “In 40 days,’’ said
JONAH to the people of Nineveh, “shall you and your city be destroyed, because
of your wickedness,” and they repented. And now the Prophet would cry,
REPENT and confess your sins and pray for forgiveness, for in a few years
shall Man's EMPIRES, KINGDOMS. REPUBLICS, AND GOVERNMENTS
be utterly destroyed, and ANOTHER KINGDOM be set up of RIGHTEOUS-
NESS aiid Peace, which shall last a thousand years, and shall never after pass
away And it is fast coming upon us. PREPARE —GET READY, NOW—
REPENT, for the time DETERMINED UPON BY GOD ALMIGHTY is close
at hand, when all men and nations shall be JUDGED, and the angel shall
cry aloud, “TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER," for the GREAT DAY of God's
indignation and wrath is come (Rev., 10-6, and Rev., c. 16, v. 17).
14. Man has been on trial now for nearly 6000 years, God’s six days, and has
PAIRED UTTERLY to keep the Peace. His w’ays have been full of E\ IL,
AND VIOLENCE CONTINUALLY. Therefore, his Kingdoms and Govern-
ments shall be taken from him, and a Kingdom shall be set up with Christ
as Supreme Ruler at Jerusalem, and the beginning of the 7000 years, God’s
seventh day from Man’s Creation will (according to all evidence) be the
beginning of a NEW LAW and Reign under Christ and His Apostles and
Prophets and believers.
Man’s Government and all the Nations, Britain included, has been
“WEIGHED IN THE BALANCES AND FOUND WANTING.”
15. PREPARE! PREPARE! GET READY'! GET READY'! All men
and women are in the POWER OF SATAN, and it is to get us out of Satan’s
Power that God-inspired Men wrote the Bible, and it was to break Satan's
power that Christ came to this earth. So you see the importance and urgency
of believing in Christ and in the Bible, for it IS THE ONLY' BOOK THAT
CONTAINS THE WISDOM OF ALL THE AGES.
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.
GET READY! GET READY! GET READY!
READ, READ, READ, LEARN, AND INVESTIGATE THIS!
16. In drawing your attention to these INFINITELY GREAT IRUIHS con-
tained herein, we are doing you THE GREATEST SERVICE ONE MAN CAN
DO TO ANOTHER, for it is your EVERLASTING WELFARE that is at stake.
Don’t PLAY THE FOOL WITH YOUR Mind, Soul and Body by disbelieving
and neglecting God’s Warnings, and don’t'delude yourself that “it is all right,”
that “there is nothing To fear.” God plainly tells us there “it is a dreadful
time and punishment for the WILFUL DISBELIEN ER, SCORNER, SCOFFER,
AND NEGLECTOR OF HIS WORD and WARNINGS, and that the time is
close at hand when He will judge the World and EVERY' MAN in it. God’s
judgments are even now commencing on all nations. What can the. Atheists,
Rationalists,,■ Spiritualists, Agnostics, INFIDEL Scientists, Christian Scien-
tists and Higher Critics do for you? What hope, what light, what help, can
they give you in time of fear and trouble? They cannot help themselves,
neither can they agree amongst themselves. Their opinions are constantly
changing • but note this—THE BIBLE NEVER CHANGES, neither does it
require TO BE BROUGHT UP TO DATE, for it FORETELLS EVERY-
THING, and gives the whole History of THIS World IN ADVANCE from
its beginning to its END,' and it foretells the attitude of people and state of
tneir mind towards God. What other book in the World does this? NONE.
Therefore, it is INFINITELY necessary to .study this Book for OUR


SAFETY’S SAKE. It is no use putting it off. for OUR TURN FOR DEATH
may be the very NEXT. So, mind what you are about.
17. BUSINESS IS BUSINESS, and this is the most pressing business of
all—Belief in the Bible, in God, and in Christ. It is not getting religion, or
religious, but it is getting A CHANGE OF MIND, a changed outlook on life,
a different view. You may be a tremendous power for good in God’s Hands,
or a fearful power for Evil in Satan’s hands. Choose! There are only two
powers in this World—God and Satan. If we are not serving God. then
we are in Satan’s power, serving him; there is no middle course. FOR SATAN
IS THE GREAT REBELLIOUS ANGEL, and has ASSUMED to CONTROL
MEN. (See Job, c. 1; Rev., c. 12, v. 9, 11; 2 Cor., c. 4, v. 4; 2 Cor., c. 11, v. 14.)
18. “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God,” unbe-
lieving, unrepentant, unprepared, our sins unconfessed, forgiveness not asked
for, and our sins uriforgiven. In Christ’s Name we call you to repentance.
Now this is your chance; take it while God gives you time and opportunity,
for there is NO TIME or PLACE in the GRAVE to prepare. Pray, confess,
repent, or believe —it MUST be done HERE on Earth, and NOW.
18. (at If man puts God out of his life, then he lets the EVIL ONE in. Our
life cannot remain empty. It must be controlled by either God or Satan. As
this is true then those who are living with no thought of God in their lives
are in terrible danger, and are in Satan’s power.
19. The Almighty sets LITTLE VALUE on man’s earthly life as it is only-
temporary, for God tells us, “This is not our abiding place,” but He sets
TREMENDOUS value on our Spiritual life because that lasts for ever, and
we must make IMMEDIATE preparation for it; there is no time to lose, set
about it NOW. No business on earth is as important as this, see to it.
There is nothing in this World so SURE and CERTAIN as the Second Coming
of Christ in the very near future. Why? To take away the believers out
of this world for a short time to judge them, and seven years after HE
RETURNS the third time. Why? To destroy all evil Governments, Nations,
and men, and to set up His Own Universal Government, and reign in PERSON
over all the Earth. We are told in Revelations: “And the Cities of the Nations
fell”—that is the time THEY WILL FALL and the Ruling Government shall
be centralised at Jerusalem, under Christ, “The King of Kings,” and the only
ruler of the Princes. It is God’s will that ONE MAN shall RULE all Nations.
THE 7 AGES OF A 1000 YEARS EACH.
THE NUMBER “7” A FOUNDATION NUMBER IN THE BIBLE.
20. There is a wonderful mysteriousness about the number 7 right through-
out the Bible. The 7 days or ages of Creation, the 7 days of the week, the 7th
month, the 7th year, when the land should not be sown but have a rest for
one year. The 7 candlesticks, the 7 churches of Asia, the 7 trumpets, the T
last plagues, the 7 Angels, the 7 Spirits, the 7 Ages, or 7 thousand years
since the Creation of Man, and the 7 years of Great Tribulation that is
coming soon. The number 7is the Foundation Number of the Bible, also the
significant No. 3—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
21. We are near to that 7000th year now, and before the commencement of
the 7000th s ear the Millennium is to be brought in, and Christ’s Personal King-
dom on Earth is to commence, when all Man’s Government, Empires, King-
doms. and Republics are to be put down for ever and done away with. “The
Kingdoms of the Earth will not be left to other people” (see Daniel, ch. 2,
verse 44) IT MUST COME, for all the other Prophecies have come true to
the letter, and this Prophecy will surely be fulfilled soon. Read Daniel and
Revelations. Unto the end of man’s government wars aind desolation are
determined. (See Daniel, e. 9, v. 26.)
22. There is every Promise, every Prophecy, and every indication in the
Signs of these times, showing that this 20th Century will be the last of Man's
misgoverrment. The final end to all Empires. Kingdoms, and Republics, for


•11 the Prophecies point to this age as being the last of Man’s Governments
Man has now had nearly 0000 years of trial in which to learn God's laws, and
right ways, how to keep the Peace, and to turn away from Evil and Violence.
? thls ~ MAN GETS WORSE instead of better. He makes War on a
ARGLK and more TERRIFIC SCALE than ever before, and he uses all his
inventiveness and discoveries and science for the more colossal injury and
destruction of his fellow-man, and evil and wickedness abound in both high
and lew alike. Violence and ferocity, hatred and anger, lies, thievings, and
murder abound, and all business is full of hatred and jealousy, each man
trjmg his hardest to down his fellow-man and to steal his business and liveli-
hood and profession from him. and trample him underfoot and get rich quick
always at his fellow-man’s expense. Man has about run his full tether, and
it is now nearly “thus far and no further” with all nations and individuals.
23. O Lord, our Rnler and King of Kings and Lord of Lords, come quickly
THY KINGDOM of Righteousness and Love and Justice, for Man
WILL NEVER IMPROVE OR GET BETTER, all our Learning, Education.
Science, Culture, Inventiveness, and Civilisation, is of no real use to us, for
we misuse everything we discover, and divert their uses to destroy our fellow-
man. MANKIND WILL NEVER IMPROVE IF HE HAS 60,000 YEARS to
do it in, instead of 6000; it will always be a continuous history of evil, wars,
lies, thievings, and murderings, hatreds, envies, malice, and jealousy in. busi-
ness, and in Politics, and in Religion; road the past history of the Race of
men from Adam downwards—and at THIS DAY MAN IS WORSE THAN
EVER HE WAS, for he believes only in himself. God has no place in his
“rr^evr is Man first - and God not at all. Man has set up a NEW
IDOL, SCIENCE, which he worships now. But Science cannot save us.
24. Don’t be deceived by the present apparent safe order of things; they
won’t last. The present order of things cannot last. As a man passes away
for ever to a permanent state of ill, or well-being—so will Man’s Empires,
Kingdoms, Republics, and Governments pass away for ever.
25. The present state of ill-being of all nations will pass away for ever and
a state of well-being will be introduced in this World by our Lord in person,
who will shatter the present Kingdoms of men into atoms, and set up His
universal Kingdom, which shall never pass away.
26. The Clergy are not doing their duty in warning the people of the great
trouble coming on Earth. They are leading the people into a false sense of
Security. Be warned, take warning, prepare, get ready! The end of all Man’s
Governments, Empires, Kingdoms, and Republics is close upon us, as con-
stantly prophesied and told us by all the Prophets, and confirmed by God in
Christ Our Lord has given men TO KNOW THE TIMES OF THE END by
Prophecy, by the Signs in the World around coinciding with the Prophecies
but rot the exact day, hour, or year, when He shall come to put the Kingdoms
of men and all evil down.
ul. All this knowledge to know about the Bible, God’s plan of Salvation
through Christ will be of no use to us, unless we BELIEVE and confess our
offences and transgressions and sins (for we have all done w rong, and’it is
no use denying it) to God and ask for His forgiveness and help for Christ’s
sake, and pray earnestly and regularly every day for “the Power” from God
to help us to resist and overcome all evil and temptation.
28. Oh! Men and Women, it is all so easy, simple, and plain, and God’e
forgiveness can be obtained with or without Clergy, Church, and Ceremonies.
It is not getting religious or religion that is wanted, but getting yourself
forgiveness from God, and being yourself reconciled to Him. Is your heart
right with God? If not, get right with Him at once. Say this simple prayer:
‘God lie merciful to me, an offender and transgressor against thee, and forgive
all my sins for Jesus Christ, Thy Son's sake, and give me ‘the Power of the
Holy Spirit’ to amend my life, and give me strength to resist all evil and
temptation,” and before you have FINISHED confessing and asking, your


prayer will be heard and answered, and you are forgiven, for the Angels WHO
ARE WATCHING US will say, “Behold he prayeth.” (See Acts, c. 9, v. 11.)
29. You may say by what authority do you give this warning? By the
authority of all God’s Prophets and by the greater Authority of Jesus Christ.
Look ir up yourself and see it all in the Bible.
30. Why is THIS CENTURY POINTED to as being the END of Man’s
Governments? Because of the Prophecy of the 7 times of trouble that was to
pass over the Jewish people for their disobedience and sins (see Leviticus,
ch. 26). The Prophecy is four times repeated by Moses, and the great pre-
liminary trouble on both the Jewish nation and the Gentile nations com-
menced about the year 606 B.C. For then there was almost universal war,
distress and destruction upon all nations, both Jewish and Gentiles. See
Jeremiah, c. 25, vs. 15 to 28. But the seven times of chastisement and
trouble of 2520 years really commenced about the year 588 8.C., when the
whole Jewish nation was rooted up out of Palestine and carried into captivity.
See 2nd Kings, c. 25. Also seven times of trouble and chastisement com-
menced on the Gentile nations. See Daniel’s Prophecy four times repeated
(Daniel, c. 4), typified by the seven times of trouble and chastisement —
seven years—2s2o days—that the GREAT KING OF KINGS. NEBUCHAD-
NEZZAR, had to endure for his pride and evil ways. A time—prophetic and
Astronomic —is 360 years—the same number of years as the 360 days of the
Astronomic —prophetic and Jewish year —so as seven times 360 is 2520 years,
add 588 B.C. and 1932 A.D. That is exactly 2520 years—the seven times com-
plete. Therefore, as the Preliminary trouble began about 606 8.C., and
increased in violence to about 588, so the Preliminary trouble began 1914 A.D.,
2520 years from 606 8.C., and the trouble will continue to increase on all
nations till about 1932. Therefore we are in the last time of the great trouble,
which will end in “THE GREAT TRIBULATION,” such as never was since the
foundation of the world, when the LORD JESUS CHRIST MUST COME IN
PERSON to set up His OWN REIGN AND LAW, and destroy and put down
the evil nations and people, while it Ms business and pleasure as usual with
SCOFFING, UNBELIEVING mankind. The seven times of Jewish and Gen-
tile trouble began together and will end together, and the end of ALL human
rule and government and the seven years of great tribulation will com©
between now and about 1932 According to the exact time limit in
the Prophecy of the seven times of the Gentiles, 15 years from 1917.
The ALMIGHTY ALWAYS GIVES A PRELIMINARY WARNING. The
Jews had it, and now we are having it in this appalling crash and “shaking
of the nations.”
31. Before the 7th thousand year commences Christ will reign in Person on
Earth. That will be the commencement of the Millennium —when all evil
shall be held in check. There shall be no slums, no drunkenness, no social
evil, no diseases, no plagues, no pestilence, no famines, no storms, no earth-
quakes, no violence, no wars, no floods, no untimely deaths except for those
who wilfully go against Christ’s Law, and do evil. No savage animals, no
stinging insects, nothing but harmony between man and man, and content-
ment and easy conditions, no overwork, no underpay, everything just and
favorable. All this delightful condition of life on Earth will not be brought
about by the LABOR PARTY or the SOCIALISTS, or the Anarchists. They
will have nothing to do with it. or its inception. This whole blissful state
of earthly conditions will be brought about by Christ alone. Himself ruling
and giving the Law to all Nations, and He will so alter the present earthly
conditions that the climates of the earth will be much improved, and all
savagery of beasts and insects turned to mildness, and mankind shall live
to a thousand years of age as they did in Adam’s time (see Genesis, c. 5.) 1 '
31a. So get ready! Get ready to enjoy with others that delightful state of
existence for the believer is promised a share of that life with Christ and
His Apostles and Prophets, and all who have been faithful to Him through the
Ages. For only the believers can live again on earth —no others


32. This is the Gospel or Message of “the Kingdom of God,” which was
preached when Christ was on Earth before, as being at hand; but the Jews
rejected Christ, and refused the Kingdom. Therefore, it was deferred until
other nations should accept. and believe in Christ, and at the end of a
certain time, about 2000 years, Christ should come again and set up this
Kingdom of God in Person. Do you understand THIS; That Christ will
come again into the life of this -world and reign in person on earth?
33. The creation of Man is given at 3996 B.C. by DIMBLEBY, the great
English astronomer, in his book, “ALL PAST TIME.” By exact calculation
and tracing back the movements of the Planets and Eclipses, when all the
times of the Planets commenced together, in Man’s creation week —September
23, year 0. So this proves by ASTRONOMICAL calculation that -we are
actually NOW in the LAST century of the 6000 years. Bishop Usher 200
years ago calculated back and gave 4004 B.C.- as the DATE of the CREATION
of MAN, and he got REMARKABLY near to it, considering he knew nothing
of Astronomy, and depended entirely upon the records of the CHALDEANS
and HEBREWS. This is the date given in our Bibles, and is almost exact.
AT ARMAGEDDON IN PALESTINE.
(See Revelations, Ch. 16, Verse 16.)
34. “THE WISE SHALL UNDERSTAND” (see Daniel, c. 12, v. 4). BE
ONE OF THE WISE. The GREAT GOD ALMIGHTY has MADE KNOWN
TO men what shall happen on earth.
35. A great smash up of the Nations is coming shortly, and before then
men will be plagued with great plagues (as in the time of Moses in Egypt), of
wars, famines, earthquakes, sores, pestilences, etc., because of their continual
UNBELIEF and defiance of God and His commands (see Rev., ch. 9 and
c. 16, vs. 2,8, 9, ia. 11).
36. If men will not be persuaded by appeal to reason and love, then they
must be shown the TERRORS of the LORD ALMIGHTY and be CONVINCED
BY FEAR of HIS JUDGMENTS.
37. If we can only ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION and put a THOUGHT
OF GOD into your MIND and Heart to stay there, great good will result to you.
38. There is no time to lose now, as the Nations are in their last stages.
Besides which a man’s life is very uncertain. It may be by overstudy, too
close attention to business, accident, insensibility, paralysis, insanity, or
sudden death. Any of these would prevent a man from repenting of his
offences and trangressions against God, or against our fellow man. SO DON’T
CHANCE IT. It is no use asking God for forgiveness if w r e have any disbelief
about Christ. Make sure now of your safety in the life to come by belief in
the Saviour of mankind—the Lord Jesus Christ—and ask God for forgiveness
for Christ’s sake.
And no matter what happens to the world now or hereafter, YOU will be
safe forever, for the trouble is deepening and increasing on earth.
THE IMMEDIATE COMING SIGNS AND EVENTS ARE;
39. An Armed League of Peace or Confederacy of 10 European Nations or
10 Kings after this War. Corresponding to the 10 toes of Daniel’s Image of
the Nations. See Daniel, ch. 2, verses 31 to 45.
40. The coming of another great war and a great CONQUEROR, who
will be Emperor of the world, the ANTICHRIST, like Napoleon, only much
•worse. See Daniel c. 7, vs. 24 to 27; Revelations, c. 13, v. 7-8. See Par. 57


41. The coming return of the Jews to Palestine to be a nation again. See
'saiah and all the Prophets.
42. And the coming Final War and Battle which will be at a PLACE
called Armageddon in Palestine. At which place will be the great destruction
of all the Nations assembled there. See Revelations, c. 16, v. 16.
43. So great is to be the Judgment that two-thirds of the population of the
EARTH SHALL BE DESTROYED by Wars, Famines and Plagues. See Reve-
lations, c. 9, v. 18. A great and terrible hail shall DESTROY THE ARMIES
(see Revelations, c. 16, v. 21), and an appalling earthquake shall be over the
whole Earth, which shall destroy the cities and alter the entire appearance
and configuration of the world’s surface. See Revelations, c. 16, vs. 18, 19, 20;
c. 6, v. 14. “The Earth shall be moved out of its present place” (see Isaiah,
ch. 13, verse 13), and occupy a different position towards the sun, being nearly
upright, so that even day and night and even seasons shall be over the whole
world, thereby lengthening man’s life on Earth again to about 1000 years, as in
Adam’s age (see Genesis, c. 5).
4Sa. Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, South America, and South Africa
are in this trouble. Many of the mountains shall fall and the islands will
disappear (see Revelations, c. 16, v. 20), and the HUGE OVERGROWN CITIES,
seething sinks of wickedness and crime, will be overthrown, for no righteous-
ness CAN ABIDE in them. The People shall live on the Land. It shall be
CO-OPERATION, NOT FRANTIC COMPETITION, and all DEGRADING
and INJURIOUS work and industries shall be done away with.
44. The Nations could in course of time recover from their losses and
damage in this war if time was allowed them as in the past; but time will
not be granted to them. Events are moving on to a final termination, and
the Angel of the Lord is to cry aloud. “Time shall be no longer.” See Reve-
lations, c. 10, v. 6. This is to be in this half of this century.
45. What HAPPENS in EUROPE is but a FRENZIED struggle of the
Nations for MASTERY, POWER AND TERRITORY, but WATCH PALES-
TINE. THAT COUNTRY’S CONDITION is the SURE INDICATOR of what
is to come, and the pivot around which all the nations revolve. Watch for the
Turkish Rule to cease there, and directly it ceases, and the country is free,
the Jews will rapidly RE-SETTLE there again as a NATION, and will
JiEBUILD “SOLOMON’S TEMPLE.” The plans are out for it already.
That CONDITION of Palestine will be the sign to all the hjations of the
World of the coming end of Gentile rule and Government, and the death-knell
of the present order of Human Government, and the upsetting of our present
Civilisation that we boast so much about and pride ourselves upon. I say
watch this.
46. This is written to ROUSE and STIR up the INDIFFERENT, CARE-
LESS, and UNBELIEVING PEOPLE, and to instruct them in the Prophecies.
The UNMISTAKABLE FULFILMENT of the Prophecies before our very
eyes, and SIGNS of these LAST DAYS.
47. MEN and WOMEN are not TAUGHT, INSTRUCTED or SHOWN the
Prophecies, as they should be by the Clergy; nor how URGENT is
GOD’S WARNING and MESSAGE to mankind, and how QUICKLY
and AT ONCE IT MUST BE ATTENDED TO, by the YOUNG AS WELL
AS THE OLD. So it comes to this, seeing ALL THESE THINGS are
coming to fulfilment. “WHAT SHALL WE DO to be made SAFE
and be PROTECTED” from God’s JUST INDIGNATION at man’s
CONTINUAL VIOLENCE, UNBELIEF, NEGLECT and DEFIANCE of God
and Hie Commands?' “BELIEVE on the Lord Jesus Christ” and we shall be
saved and protected FOR EVER. For He is the ONLY SAVIOUR, and there
is NONE OTHER, and ask for POWER to amend our life and acknowledge
our offences and shortcomings.


USELESS AND FUTILE LIVING,
4S. So many people live a futile life —“NOTHING DOING” for God
Almighty, or for the saving of their fellow-man—all living to themselves —eat,
sleep, dress, business, pleasure, amusement, and so the futile living goes on for
days, weeks, months, years, and they fall into their graves with NOTHING
DONE, neither for their own future life, or their God, nor for their fellow-man.
Futile living—“ Dead Posts,” not “living trees” as they should be —“Unprofit-
able servants unto me,” saith the Lord. The Lord expects us to be living
trees, bringing forth fruit in His service, “Laborers in His Vineyard,” not
dead or dying trees fit only “to be hewn down and cast into the fire.” The
Lord God wants men to see themselves as they ARE in His Sight, Trans-
gressors and Offenders, Needing Salvation, not as they think themselves,
Law-abiding, Good-living, Self-righteous, doing good works for the applause
of men, refined, clever, scientific. These things are ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING in God’s sight. He wants our attention, our service in His Cause,
and lo rely on Him and not on ourselves.
' 43. Mar: is most indulgent towards his own offences, sins and shortcomings.
He thinks them only slight inaccuracies, only a slight deviation from the
right way, and therefore excusable.
50. But God Almighty takes such a SERIOUS VIEW of man’s SINS,
OFFENCES, and BREACHES of His Law, that He sent us no less than His
OWN SON to suffer the penalty for man’s wrongdoing and wrongthinking,
thereby showing us men our responsibility to God.
51. The Almighty God and Saviour has ORDAINED EVERY man to pro-
claim His “GOSPEL” or “MESSAGE” to our fellow-man. It is not only the
Clergy’s business, it is everyone’s duty.
52. The Christian Religion is practical, and must be PRACTISED EVERY
DAY and carried into our business life —not put on for Sunday, like Sunday
clothes, and taken off on Monday and put away for a week. That kind
of Christianity is the curse of our modern life, and results in making
PHARISEES AND HYPOCRITES of those who so use Christianity. If
Christianity is not taken into our business and every work and relation of
our life, then it is useless to us, for it is first of all a practical religion, not
theoretical. Men and women worship the “ Moloch ” of business, trade,
commerce, and worldly pleasures which Moloch will inevitably CRUSH and
wither the soul within us if we give it ALL our ATTENTION AND DEVO-
TION and Thought.
53. So note this:- —GOD WILL NOT BE SET ASIDE for any man’s busi-
ness or pleasure—and if man sets Him aside, and NEGLECTS and DEFIES
Him, then the INEVITABLE JUDGMENT upon man MUST FOLLOW, and
is COMING. What are you going to do about it?
53a. Sin persisted in ends in fearful judgment. Illustrations of this in the
DELUGE, the DESTRUCTION OF SODOM and GOMORRAH. Predictions of
future judgment just as sure. (Ecc., xii., 14; Acts, xvii., 31.) God WARNS
before Ho punishes. HE USES EVERY MEANS TO SAVE MEN FROM
RUIN. Like the danger signal on the line, the light upon the rocky coast, the
watchman’s trumpet, God’s messengers of warning are intended for man’s
SALVATION. Men are lost not so much through ignorance as through
indifference, neglect, carelessness, and by UNBELIEF. Men abuse this
Divine long suffering. While He waits to be gracious they find in his delay
further encouragement to sin. (Ecc., viii., 11.) Then judgment falls. They are
wedded to their sin. Even the announcement of judgment fails to produce
repentance. What are you going to do about it?
. 54. It is not that careless, neglecting or unbelieving people cam ot
UNDERSTAND or BELIEVE in the Bible. The PLAIN TRUTH is THEY
DO NOT WANT TO BELIEVE in it; it imposes a restraint upon men. Men
will risk anything to have their own way and do as they like —risk everlasting
suffering, darkness, and separation from God just for a few years of wilfulness
here on earth. If men brought the same intelligence and thought to bear
upon this as they do upon their worldly business and pleasure, they could


not fail to see the truth in it and believe in it. It is nothing* else but
appalling, wilful carelessness, neglect, and blindness on the part of ths
people to-day. And “how shall we escape if we neglect” these things?
55. The Lord Jesus confirmed all that the Prophets wrote. He referred us
to Adam, Moses, Noah, Abraham, Lot, Jonah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Daniel.
He nevei accused any of the Prophets of exaggeration or mis-statement, but
referred us to their writings for our instruction.
WRONG PRAYING.
56. Our Lord tells us: “Ye receive not because ye ask (and pray) amiss."
Praying to the \ irgin Mary, Saints, Apostles, or Prophets is useless and
futile praying, and such prayers will not be accepted or received, and are an
affront and an OFFENCE to Almighty God. As the Angel said to St. John:
“See thou do it not. Worship God.”—Rev., c. 22, v. 9. PRAY TO JESUS
CHRIST. He is our ADVOCATE and INTERCESSOR and none other.
BE PREPARED.
57. It is quite possible that after the war is over there may be a SEMBLANCE
of peace and prosperity for a year or two. It is just then when people think
there is peace and safety and things are gradually settling back into their
old groove again that the peace and safety will suddenly disappear and an
awful and sudden upheaval and destruction will come upon the nations
by another terrible war. Not from Germany, but from the NEAR EAST, under
the COMING GREAT CONQUEROR, “THE ANTICHRIST,” who will become
WORLD EMPEROR, and will shortly set up “THE DEVIL’S EMPIRE.” He is
NOW ALIVE, according to “the 7 times of the Gentiles,” but is not yet
manifested, but will begin to attract attention in a very few years, like
Napoleon did. Nothing can avert the danger of these times, “for the iniquity
of the Nations MUST come to the full.” Nothing can stop the downward rush
of Nations to wholesale destruction. All that can be done is to try and draw
some of the people out of it by BELIEF IN JESUS CHRIST, for “the World
cannot be converted,” but God is OFFERING all men and women FORGIVE-
NESS, Peace, and Safety Free THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, and He is daily
beseeching us to take it and be reconciled to Him; for He warns us “Yet
once more I will terribly shake the Earth” (see Hebrews, c. 12, v. 26); “I will
not keep silent” (see Joel, c. 3, v. 16).
58. Some people say God could not punish mankind for ever for the sins
and offences committed here in this short life; but they FORGET that men cut
IHEMSLLV ES off and DELIBERATELY turn from God and go their own
way. They are INIDIFFERENT, NEGLECTFUL, CARELESS, UNBELIEV-
ING, and SPURN GOD’s offer of salvation and His love, and DISBELIEVE
His Word, thereby making out God to be a liar and His Prophets and His Son
Jesus Christ impostors. It is this terrible attitude of mankind that brings
about that EVERLASTING DISTRESS, and ANGUISH and SELF-PUNISH-
MENT. They have SEPARATED themselves VOLUNTARILY from all God’s
provision for man’s welfare, salvation, and everlasting blessing, and have cut
THEMSELVES off forever.
59. They will see in the next life when it is TOO LATE what a terrible
thing they have done with their own lives and destiny, and how easily they
cou’d have had every blessing. Nothing to do of themselves, all DONE for
them, every provision made for their sins and offences, and all THEY HAD
TO DO WAS TO BELIEVE and confess their offences and shortcomings.
60, Referring to paragraph 30 and the reference to dates, they have a
GREAT significance. By whose authority do the clergy or any Bible student
say that they must not study or consider periods, times, and dates, when the
whole Bible is full of it, and an exact reference book? What about the 7 times
of trouble on both Jews and Gentiles? And did not Daniel consider dates
when he studied Jeremiah’s prophecy of 70 years to the return of the Jews
and the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and is not the whole Book of Daniel a study
of dates —the 70 weeks of years, 70 times 7, 490 years, 69 weeks of years to the
coming of Christ, and 1 week of 7 years for the great tribulation which is


coming, and the 1290 days and the 1335 days signifying the 3£ years, the latter
half of the 7 years of great tribulation; and a time, times and a half, a year
2 years and a half, which refers to the above half of the'tribulation?
61. Did not the expecting Jews study Daniel’s prophecy of the coming of
the Messiah by the number of years and weeks that he gave? Therefore who
dares to say that we must not consider or study times and dates when our
Dord refers us to Daniel, and tells us: “When ye see these things coming to
pass KNOW ye that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand. (See Luke, c. 21,
v. 31.) Certainly He said, “Of that day and hour knoweth no man,” not the
exact day or month, but He told us about the time by the events and signs
around us.
AWAKE! AWAKE!
G 2. The Lord is calling to us by the still small voice of our conscience and
by the thundering tones of the great signs and events around us to amend our
ways and turn to Him while there is yet time, and before the great DESTRUC-
TION comes upon mankind.
TAKE HEED TO THIS.
63 “It is NOW God is commanding ALL men everywhere to REPENT,
because He has APPOINTED A DAY (in this half-century) in which He will
judge the world.” See Acts, c. 17, vs. 30-31. “When He shall judge the
secrets (and lives) of men by Jesus Christ” (see Romans, c. 2. v. 16), Who is
CREATOR, LIFE-GIVER, DELIVERER, REDEEMER, and JUDGE to be.
64. Use this knowledge to HELP, and WARN, and INSTRUCT your friends
and acquaintances and EVERYONE YOU CAN.
As the STATEMENTS set forth in this booklet are not OPINIONS, but
STATEMENTS from THE WORD OF GOD THROUGH HIS PROPHETS
and through JESUS CHRIST HIS SON, IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THEM
or consider them true, produce YOUR PROOFS to the CONTRARY—PROVE
THEM WRONG IP YOU CAN by infallible authority, AS THIS IS PROVED
TO BE RIGHT AND TRUE BY THE INFALLIBLE AUTHORITY OF GOD’S
WORD.
CONSIDER THIS.
ALL HUMAN HISTORY AND DESTINY IS MAPPED OUT IN THE
SCRIPTURES.
65. And now about the creation of man and the statements and Prophecies
foretelling our destiny in the Scriptures. Man’s government and rule is
limited to 6000 years, beyond which it cannot pass; it is the absolute time
limit set by Almighty God. What authority is there for this? The Scriptures
give it. Man’s creation, rule, and government commenced about 4000 years
8.C., and as this is 1917 after Christ, there are only a very few more years
to go.
66. The time limit is NEARLY REACHED, and it MUST FINISH THIS
CENTURY —the 6000 years is typified by the six days of the week, the
same as it typifies the six days or 6000 years of creation. As we are told, “a
day with the Lord is as a thousand years.” See 2nd Peter, c. 3, v. 8. And
the seventh day typifies a thousand years of rest and peace—the Millennium.
Therefore BEFORE the seventh thousand year commences the Lord Jesus
Christ must come again to this earth to judge those that are ALIVE and set
•up HIS OWN REIGN and RULE EVERYWHERE, the seventh day—the
Millennium. The Prophecies have an exact time limit—nothing is indefinite —
otherwise the Prophecies would have no value whatever if they were indefinite.
CAN WE LIVE AGAIN ON THIS EARTH?
67. This is a most beautiful world, and we all have a great desire and
aspiration to see its beauties and to travel all over the world everywhere.
Can we have another life on earth? YES, but only on ONE condition. Only
those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as our Saviour and the Son of


God can live on earth, or see this earth again. They will then be- able to
see all the beauties and loveliness of this earth, and to travel all over it.
The unbelievers cannot, for they are kept in Hades or darkness until the
PINAL resurrection of the Dead at the last, the second great judgment day.
f>B. Now it ought to be quite easy for you to come to a clear understanding
of these matters and with yourself, and to KNOW how you stand in relation to
God and Jesus Christ.
Take out the OLD and NEW TESTAMENT and READ IT. READ it as
CLOSELY as you do your NOVELS and daily NEWSPAPERS, and with as
much eagerness to find out “NEWS,” for “NEWS” there is in it, and of
tremendous importance to you; news affecting the things of this world which,
however, pass like a breath and are no more, and “NEWS” which treats of
the Eternal facts of life and death, a hereafter, and a judgment speedily
coming. READ this BOOK for yourself, I say, all of it, and devote vour
EARNEST ATTENTION to it as of PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, and before
every temporary business of this life. See if your private and personal life
is in keeping with the commands there set down. If you are a Christian
you believe Christ was the Incarnate Son of God. Then does it not behove
you to listen ("whether Christian or not) when God speaks, or is it a matter
of indifference to you that the Maker, Creator, and Upholder of this world
and the universe around us should have condescended to give us a history
of mankind and of the world, a plan of salmtion and life, a plain law for our
guidance, and finally to have come down IN PERSON —I SAY in PERSON —to
bring His Kingdom to us, and to show us how to live, and finally when
the world rejected Him and His Kingdom and His Commands, to have
offered Himself up as a sacrifice, and as an atonement, and as a substitute
for our sins? Is this a matter of indifference to you? Because if so, you
place yourself in the greatest danger. What are you going to do about
it ? Mind what you are about.
69. The great astronomer Dimbleby in his great Book, “All Past Time,”
Wiites: —"Some say great harm is done by FIXING DATES, but great harm
has been done by NOT FIXING DATES. There are dates fixed at the top
of every page in the Bible without which ordinary readers would not know
when MOSES lived or the EXODUS took place, when DAVID lived, or
ABRAHAM lived, or when the FLOOD took place, or when the Kings reigned,
dr when Christ came. In fact we should know nothing for certain. It is
IDLE for anyone to say that great harm is done by fixing dates. They do not
know what they are talking about, for much harm is done by keeping
Ignorant and by NOT fixing dates. It is profitable to obtain a knowledge
of the SCIENCE OF TIME, especially SOLAR or ASTRONOMICAL time, the
only UNDEVIATING TIME we have, and the BIBLE IS FOUNDED ON
THAT TIME, which CANNOT ERR by one second in thousands of years.
The CHALDEANS and HEBREWS KEPT THAT SOLAR TIME right down
from ENOCH and NIMROD. To deny and renounce this accuracy of Bible
time is to surrender the Bible to AGNOSTICS and ATHEISTS, and to allow
them to say that BIBLE HISTORY COMPRISES LEGENDARY TALES.
The times in the Bible have all been TRACED BACK from OUR DAY to
CREATION day by PLANETARY motion, solar time and motion, and eclipses,
nnd cannot err. Bishop Usher, 200 years ago, traced back the dates and history
and reigns and events to creation time, and got remarkably close to the
exact year—only eight years out. But since his time we have had the
oenefit of IMPROVED and EXACT ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE, and
our astronomers have been able to calculate back by eclipses, etc., to their
starting point, when all planetary time started together viz., Wednesday,
September 23. 3996, 8.C., when the sun crossed the Equator, which is the Ist
,l ay of the astronomical or solar year (not January Ist), in the year 0, when
the sun and planets were all in conjunction, that is. in line,
and to the FIRST ECLIPSE of the sun, January 4, year 0. So it
is FOOLISH IGNORANCE *nd NONSENSE for anyone to say we cannot


ilx dates, for the Prophecies have all a fixed date and a time limit, otherwis«
they would be absolutely useless. Not to fix dates deprives the Prophecies
of their MEANING, so that if we cannot fix the dates of their BEGINNING
and END they are not Prophecies at all. The ANGEL GABRIEL said to
DANIEL. KNOAV THEREFORE and UNDERSTAND.” See Daniel, c, 9,
v. 25. HOW COULD DANIEL KNOW and UNDERSTAND UNLESS DATES
WERE GIVEN AND SET? Also Gabriel said to Daniel, “NOW I am COME
to MAKE THEE UNDERSTAND what shall BEFALL thy people in the
LATTER DAYS.” Note: THESE DAYS. Daniel, c. 10, v. 14. So this settles
the matter of fixing dates.
Then is this ASTOUNDING NEWS TRUE that we are at the end of
MAN'S AGE and rule, and in the LAST DAYS before the seven years of
great tribulation? Yes, it is TRUE, and there are but 13 to 15 years
the great tribulation begins.
69a. Now. concerning the END OF THIS AGE. measurements of time have
been given by the DIVINE WORD. The 6000 years from Creation is nearly
completed, and “the 7 times of the Gentiles,” 2520 years, is nearly fulfilled, so
there is no room for doubt. What we want is to LET ALL THE WORLD
KNOW IT. If they do not believe, let them INVESTIGATE this subject; but
LET NO MAN MAKE A FOOL OF HIMSELF by DISBELIEVING what he
has not INVESTIGATED or studied. Are you going to place full reliance on
those who know nothing of this matter, and who shut their eyes to facts?
Would you TRUST a DOCTOR or SURGEON with your LIFE if he had
never studied the subject of medicine or surgery? Then, why trust the
INFINITELY MORE IMPORTANT MATTER of your ETERNAL LIFE and
WELFARE to UNBELIEVERS, ATHEISTS. INFIDEL SCIENTISTS,
CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS, THEOSOPHISTS, STAR OF THE EAST
FAKIRS, and AGNOSTICS, when they know nothing of the subject of the
Scriptures and our eternal destiny?
70. Most men are in a state of unconscious ignorance of these matters, and
the STRANGEST thing IS, they do not want to be instructed, awakened,
or shown the true state of their relation to God their Creator, or their place
and destiny in the world, or to be shown how they can be saved from everlast-
ing remorse and trouble for neglecting these matters.
71. Perhaps you ask what is the strong point in this pamphlet? First it
is the almost IMMEDIATE SECOND COMING of the Lord Jesus Christ to this
earth in PERSON to judge this world and EVERY MAN in it, and to set up
His own rule, and reign in PERSON on earth; and second, it is for YOU to
BELIEVE this and to accept Him as your Saviour, and so be saved, and may
this be a turning point in your life.
72 The writer of this is evidently trying his best to do us a good turn
both for THIS life and the life that is COMING, by drawing our attention
to these matters, and by explaining and making this subject clear to us. I
had better see into this matter. It will be to my benefit and profit to
give it my attention, and look up the Scriptures to see if it IS right, for
as he says, men try and make every provision for this life, but they make
no provision for the AFTER life whatever.
TAKE NO CHANCES.
73. 1 appeal to you, beseech and implore you, to investigate these matters—
to accept of the-safety and protection offered to us all personally by Almi-hty
God. " y
I go to the Bible to learn things like going to school; not to criticise
dispute with, or attempt to teach the instructor, for “the Everlasting Gospel”
will be a witness against me if I disbelieve or neglect it at the Great Judgment
Day.
74. When Christ comes there is to be a JUDGMENT of the LIVING which
Is AS SURE as that of the DEAD. His judgment sends the believer into
EVERLASTING LIFE and HAPPINESS and sends the DISBELIEVING!


/tnd v. irked into everlasting PUNISHMENT. Now, how ought the careless
and neglecting people to feel ALARMED now that we are daily expecting the
LORD TO COME? How ought they to FEEL ALARM at the thought of an
IMMEDIATE JUDGMENT while they ARE YET ALIVE?
ir/"' mL COMING DEVIL’S EMPIRE (see Paragraph 57) that is
SHORTLY to he set up under “the Antichrist,” the coming GREAT WORLD
CONQUEROR—“Who is able to make war with him” (see Rev., c. 13, v. 4)
nobody will be allowed to BUY or SELL or do BUSINESS who has not this
RULER S (ANTICHRIST) MARK, INITIAL, NAME, BADGE, or “NUMBER
€65” on him. (See Rev., c. 13, vs. 15, 16, 17, 18.) This is to be the state
of tyranny that will be set up: Men and women HUNTED DOWN and
STALV ED and not allowed to LIVE who believe in God, for Antichrist will
insist iijujn being worshipped himself, “Setting himself up as god” (see Rev.,
c 13, v. 7-8). This will be the great tribulation of 7 years described through-
out Revelations, and just before Christ’s second coming. The nations are
lapidly preparing the way for this state of things by their wickedness and
defiance and rebellion against Almighty God. If men will follow Satan’s
leadership, then with Satan they must go to everlasting punishment.
7( : - “ if any man sin (and we ALL do) we have an ADVOCATE with the
IATHEIi, JESUS CHRIST the RIGHTEOUS, who is the propitiation for our
sins.” —Ist John, c. 2, v. 1.
If \\e confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."—lst John, c. 1, v. 9.
“Be it known unto you therefore, that through this MAN (Christ) is
preached (and offered free) unto you the forgiveness of sins, and by HIM
ah that believe are JUSTIFIED from ALL THINGS.”—Acts, c. 13, v. 38, 39.
So now is you chance—take it
WHAT FOLLOWS THE WAR.
A SUMMARY OF COMING EVENTS.
77. A CONFEDERACY OF TEN NATIONS, or Kingdoms, armed to the
teeth to preserve peace, also RED REPUBLICANISM will spread over the
whole world, producing ANARCHY, which will prepare the way for “The
MAN.” “The ANTICHRIST,” to be the HEAD and LEADER of the Nations,
“The MAN” Democracy is looking for.
78. A CONFEDERATION OF ALL the so-called Christian Churches, the
ROMAN, GREEK, PROTESTANT, and the FREE Churches under ONE
HEAD, Civil and Religious. Beware of this coming APOSTACY. See pars.
67 and 75.
79. THE TRUE CHRISTIAN BELIEVERS will be taken out of this world
JUST BEFORE THE RISE OF THE COMING “SUPERMAN" and “WORLD
CONQUEROR,” “THE MAN OF SIN,” “THE WILFUL KING,” the “GREAT
ANTICHRIST,” who will SET UP “the DEVIL’S EMPIRE” on earth. He
will make ROME his CAPITAL and JERUSALEM his RELIGIOUS centre,
and will COMMAND EVERYONE to WORSHIP HIM and WEAR HIS MARK
or be KILLED, and will order all Christian Books and BIBLES to be
DESTROYED. See Amos, c. 8, v. 11. “Who is like unto the beast, who is
able to make war with him?” See Rev., c. 13, v. 4.


SO. SEVEN GREAT PLAGUES of WARS, FAMINES, PESTILENCES,
SCORPIONS, DARKNESS, SCORCHING HEAT, and BOILS upon ALL
Nations for their apostacy and wickedness, and for believing: in and worship-
ping “the Wilful King,” “Antichrist.” See Rev., c. 9, v. 1 to 31.
81. THE FINAL GREAT WAR and battle at Armageddon with the ten
Confederate Kings, and with “Antichrist” at their head, at Armageddon in
Palestine, and all shall be destroyed by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is
COMING, is COMING, is COMING in PERSON, “and every eye shall see
him.” See Rev., c. 1, v. 7.
82. “PUS COMING HASTETH GREATLY.” “Behold He cometh with
Clouds, “with all His Holy Angels (and believers) with Him, and EVERY
EYE SHALL SEE HIM.” “As I live, saith the Lord, every KNEE SHALL
BOW TO ME, and every tongue shall CONFESS that JESUS CHRIST IS
LORD.” See Phillipians, c. 2, v. 9-10.
S 3 In a very few years now the scornful UNBELIEF and DENIAL of
SCEPTICS, UNBELIEVERS, and FALSE CHRISTIANS will be silenced
for ever. •.
84. “IF I TELL YOU of (coming) earthly things and you believe not, how
shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?” See our Lord’s question
and rebuke in St. John, c. 3, v. 12.
85. “NOW HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD.” THUS SAITH THE
LORD: “MY DETERMINATION IS to GATHER the NATIONS (to battle),
that I may assemble the Kingdoms to pour upon them MINE INDIGNATION,
even ALL my fierce anger, for ALL the earth shall be devoured with MY
JEALOUS!.” See Zephaniah, c. 3, v. 8.
86. BEHOLD THE SIGNS of the day of God’s Judgment. THIS IS the
DAY of HIS PREPARATION. Get READY, get READY, get READY, for
the GREAT DAY of the LORD IS NEAR; “it is NEAR and HASTETH
greatly.” Zeph., c. 1, v. 14-15.
PREPARATION FOR ARMAGEDDON.
See Joel, C. 3, Vs. 9 to 16.
87 “PROCLAIM YE THIS AMONG THE GENTILES: PREPARE war,
wake up the MIGHTY men, let ALL the men of war draw near, let them
come up. Beat your ploughshares into spears, let the weak say I am strong;
assemble yourselves and come, all ye heathen (Western and Eastern nations),
and gather yourselves round about, thither cause Thy MIGHTY ones to
COME DOWN, O LORD. Let the heathen (Eastern nations) be WAKENED,
and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat (Armageddon), for there will I sit
to JUDGE ALL THE HEATHEN ROUND ABOUT, for their wickedness
is great.” “MULTITUDES, MULTITUDES in the Valley of DECISION, for
the day of the Lord is NEAR in the Valley of DECISION (Armageddon).”
The Sun and the Moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their
shining. The Lord shall ROAR out of ZION and utter His Voice from
Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall shake. But the Lord shall
be the HOPE of HIS people “and the STRPINGTH of all HIS BELIEVERS.
For the Lord shall (THEN) dwell in Jerusalem.” See Joel, c. 3, v. 21,
88. NOW THE EVENTS AND SIGNS around us COINCIDPI with our
Lord’s WORDS and WARNINGS in Matthew, c. 24; Mark, c. 13; Luke, c. 21.
89. “WHEN YE SEE THESE THINGS come to pass, KNOW YE that
the time is at hand.” Mark, c. 13, v. 29. “All these are the beginning of
sorrows, but the end is not (just) yet.” Matthew, c. 24, v. 8. “And except
those days should be shortened, there should be NO FLESH SAVED; but


for the BELIEVERS’ sake those days shall be shortened.” Matt., c. 24, v. 22.
It will be shortened to 31 years—42 months. See Re\fc, c. 11, v. 2.
‘AT THE TIME APPOINTED the end shall be.” See Daniel, c. 8. v. 9.
“IT IS FOR the time appointed.” See Daniel, c. 11, v. 35.
90. IT IS UNDENIABLE that God Almighty has LIMITED A DAY in
every man and woman’s life in which He will accept our repentance, but
if we let it go BEYOND that day there is no hope for us. THIS day may be
OUR VERY LAST in which we CAN repent.
91. WE ARE LIVING in the world’s “LAST FIVE MINUTES” of human
history and government, after which Divine Government will be set up and
a thousand years of Peace. The millennium will come in, men will not
LEARN WAR ANY MORE, and there shall be NO NAVIES and NO
ARMIES. Micah, c. 4, v. 3. BETWEEN NOW and 1929 to 1932 these things
will happen, and the Lord’s coming will be at Easter time, according to all
the evidences.
92. THE EVIDENCES ARE ASTRONOMIC, HISTORIC, and PRO-
PHETIC, A FOREVIEW OF ALL human history having been revealed to
God’s Prophets.
93. ALL PAST TIME is now CALCULATED and PROVED, the
exact year and date to the week and day—WEDNESDAY, September 23,
3996, 8.C., time commenced. See Genesis, c. 1, vs. 14 to 19. It is proved by
the number of New Moons, by the number of Eclipses of the Sun, by the
number of 7th days (Sabbaths), by the number of weeks, by the number
of Lunar years, by the number of Solar years, and by the number of the
transits of the Planets Mercury and Venus since creation WEEK. So it
IS proved that there was not ANY' previous years, or PREVIOUS TIME
BEFORE 3996 8.C., OR YEAR 0. See J. B. Dimbleby’s work, “ALL PAST
TIME*” British Astronomer and winner of the £lOO prize on “All Past
Time.’ By knowing all past time we know how much time we have left.
94. ABOUT 6000 YEARS is allowed for the TRIAL of MAN’S Government
on earth —less about 70 years. The 5930 years from Creation expires about
1932 A.D. The 70 years deduction is allowed for Satan’s “little season” on
his RELEASE FROM HADES. See Rev., c. 20, vs. 7-8.
95. THE SEVEN TIMES OF THE GENTILES—2S2O years from 588 8.C.,
when the seven times commenced —also expires about 1930 to 1932. See this
MOST IMPORTANT DATE, 588 8.C., in the Scriptures, 2nd Kings, c. 25, v. 3;
2nd Chrons., c. 36, v. 9; Ezekiel, c. 26, v. 2; and Jeremiah, c. 39, v. 1, and
Lamentations. They ALL give THIS MOST IMPORTANT DATE for the
utter destruction of Jerusalem and the burning of Solomon’s Temple, and
the complete scattering and captivity of the Jewish nation, and the REAL
BEGINNING of the seven times of trouble and chastisement of Gods’ people,
and on the Gentiles, and “Daniel” gives the beginning of the seven times
of trouble upon the GENTILE NATIONS also about that time. See Daniel,
c. 4; and see par. 30. “At the time appointed the End shall be.” “It is for
the time appointed.” See Daniel, c. 8, v. 9, and c. 11, v. 35. So it is no use
saying “these things cannot be true,” and that you do not believe it. It
is just as TRUE WITHOUT your belief as with it.
“THE WITNESS OF THE STARS.”
96. WE HAVE also “THE WITNESS OF THE STARS” by the celebrated
Drs. Ballinger and Seiss. IN ADDITION TO GOD’S WORD and RECORD
in the Scriptures given to mankind through His Prophets, and by His Son
Jesus Christ, God has TRACED in the sky for man to read nightly in the
stars HIS SIGNS and FIGURES, portraying the GREAT SCRIPTURAL


SUBJECT of man’s TEMPTATION, FALL, and REDEMPTION. The whole
subject is traced in tl*e 12 SIGNS of the ZODIAC. The stars in their groups
are NAMED, describing exactly what the subject is. In some of the groups
IHE FIRST MEN-have drawn figures corresponding to the names given
to the stars composing those groups. In other groups of stars, such as the
“CROSS and POINTERS,” the “SCORPION,” the “SERPENT,” the
“DRAGON,” and “CROWN.” the FIGURES TRACED by the stars are so
PLAIN and UNMISTAKABLE that anyone who looks at them ATTEN-
CAN SEE and understand the figures. Also the stars in these
groups are NAMED, signifying what they stand for. THE SIGNS START
WITH “VIRGO,” the “VIRGIN,” also signifying “EVE,” the Mother of all
mankind, and the serpent is shown close to her. Also “COMAE,” “the
DESIRED ONE,” signifying the CHILD CHRIST; “ANDROMEDA,” the
bound and CHAINED WOMAN, signifying ALL people and nations chained
and bound by Satan. Close by is “PERSEUS,” the MIGHTY DELIVERER,
signifying CHRIST. Next are the two chained fishes, tied by their tails
to the SEA MONSTER “CETUS,” signifying “SATAN,” who has tied all
nations to him by his LIES and DECEPTIONS. He is represented by
“DRACO,” the Dragon, “HYDRA,” the Serpent, and “CERBERUS,” the
THREE-HEADED DRAGON. Next is “CORONA,” the CROWN, which
signifies RULE and GOVERNMENT, and which the "SERPENT,” Satan, is
seen trying desperately to reach up for and SECURE. The GREAT
DELIVERER, CHRIST, is always seen close to the above figures as “PER-
SEUS,” “the KING DELIVERER,” who releases the chained woman and the
two fishes. “AURIGA,” “the KING SHEPHERD”; “BOOTES,” “the
BREAKER,” breaking the Serpent, Satan, with both hands, and who is also
seen about to crush the “SCORPION,” Satan, under His foot; “ORION.” the
MIGHTY ONE, the KING and VICTOR over the DESTROYER and
USURPER, SATAN. These are SOME of the SIGNS of the ZODIAC, and
they are WELL NAMED SIGNS—GOD’S SIGNS and WARNINGS to Man—
and all the rest of the signs continue the same subject. The “CROSS” and
pointer!-’, PARTICULARLY pointing to the GREAT SACRIFICE for Mans
redemption. The last sign is “ARA,” the “FLAMING ALTAR,” UPSIDE
DOWN in the South, significantly pointing with its flames DOWNWARDS,
showing the PLACE that Satan and HIS FOLLOWERS are cast into.
97. So you see GOD has GIVEN mankind GREAT SIGNS, besides His
WRITTEN record, “so that w T e are without excuse.” These signs w r ere
thoroughly understood by the FIRST MEN on earth, "ENOCH” and “NOAH,”
and by the Chaldeans and Hebrews, but they have been CORRUPTED and
MISNAMED by the Pagans, Indians, Greeks, and Romans, and most nations
dow r n to our day.
9S. THE OTHER SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC ARE:
“LIBRA”—The Scales of God’s Justice.
“SAGGITARIUS”—The Archer, shooting the Arrow of God’s Judgment
at the Scorpion—Satan.
“CAPRICORNUS”—The Goat, signifying the Scapegoat, Christ, taking
our sins upon Himself.
‘AQUARIUS” —The Water Bearer. The Water of Eternal Life being
poured out for ALL Nations to freeiy drink of. The two Fishes”
are shown swimming in it, and Free.
“ARIES”—The Ram of Sacrifice.
TAURUS The Bull. The Powerful One treading down the Enemy
of Man, Satan.
’’GEMINI”—The Heavenly Twins, God the Father and God the Son.
‘CANCER” The Crab. This sign has been misnamed and corrupted
by different nations. It signifies the Altar of Sacrifice.


“LEO”—The Lion of Judah —Christ.
“ARGO” The Ship, the Ark of Noah, and the Ark of SAFETY to all
who will enter in.
HE GREAT BEAR” and “LITTLE BEAR”—Misnamed and corrupted
signs. Its meaning, by the Stars named in it, signifies the GREAT
SHEEP I'old, and the LESSER Sheep Fold. A great multitude of
people saved and safe, and a smaller multitude saved in the early days.
99. “HE telleth the NUMBER of the stars and CALLETH them ALL by
their NAMES. See Psalm 147, v. 4. "The CONSTELLATIONS, their forms
as animals HE fixed.’ So, now, what excuse have we if we disregard these
things? None whatever. The world is full of Bibles and Books and tracts
and information on these subjects, and we neglect these things at our peril.
“AT THE TIME APPOINTED THE END SHALL BE”—to the VERY
year, month, week, day, and hour. Watch!
100. The Lord God Almighty is only PRESERVING us from INSTANT
death and PERMITTING us to live to see if we WILL TURN to Him and
repent, and confess our offences and shortcomings. Not that we may go
about cur worldly business and affairs, but simply to give us ANOTHER
chance of turning to Him and accepting His' FREE gift of Eternal Life of
joyous happiness through Christ, for we cannot have it apart from Him—
before it is too late.
101. one. after reading this About the Stars, can possibly look at them
again with the same eyes as before. They will see design and order, and
God’s Great Message of Love and Warning to All Mankind. Look up at the
Southern Cross, and God’s Sign of your redemption pointed to by the
2 Pointers for us to see and understand.
102.—1 n reference to Paragraphs 40, 42, 43, 75, 79, 81, 87, concerning the
assembling of the 10 Kings under the Leadership of the Coming Great Caesar-
Napoleon, World Conqueror and Dictator, “The Antichrist,” between now and
1930-31. For what purpose is this Great Assemblage of Kings with the
Armies of BRITAIN, FRANCE, ITALY, SPAIN, GREECE, AUSTRIA,
BULGARIA, TURKEY, EGYPT, and SYRIA, under the Supreme Command of
the Coming Caesar-Napoleon ? It will not be ostensibly to fight against Invisible
1 oices, against the One,-the Lord, Jesus Christ, who is at present Invisible to
Mortal Byes, and whom they will esteem as Nothing, neither will the Jewish
Nation then in Palestine be so numerous and powerful as to cause the Kings of
Western and Eastern Europe to rise and march with their Armies under “The
Antichrist,” their Champion and Leader, against them and their Land. But it
will be a MOST POWERFUL POLITICAL MOTIVE that will induce this great
gathering of Kings and Armies, namely, “TIDINGS OUT OF THE EAST AND
NORTH shall trouble him,” the Dictator Antichrist.
“THEREFORE, HE SHALL GO FORTH (with these Armies and
Kings) in great fury to destroy and utterly make away many”
(see Daniel, c. 11, v. 44). The Kings OUT of the East (Rev.,
c. 16. v. 12) —the lost and hidden 10 Tribes of Israel who were taken
captive out of Palestine by the Great Assyrian King, Shalmaneser (see 2nd
Kings, c. 17, vs. 18, 20, 23) in the year 721 B.C. They went into the far
Eastern Countries, and have remained hidden there ever since. These 10
Tribes, with apparently great multitudes to assist them, will come over the
DRIBD UP RIVER EUPHRATES in MESOPOTAMIA, for the purpose of
regaining their Land of Palestine; and attacking the Great World Conqueror
in Palestine. He having to combat with a Mighty Host, will summon the Kings
of the whole of Europe, East and West, to join him. These gather with their
armies in the plain of “ARMAGEDDON” in Palestine, and there, instead of it
being merely a battle between the Kings and the Hosts of the Earth only for


supremacy, it CHANGES, and becomes the battle of “The GREAT DAY OF GOD
ADMIGHTY,” a battle with “the Son of God” (see Rev., c. 19, vs. 11 to 21), who
comes down out of the Heavens with His Armies of Angels and Believers, and
it results in the utter destruction of all the King’s and Armies assembed there;
and at the same time an appalling Earthquake occurs over the whole world
(see Rev., c. 16, vs. 18, 19), which destroys all the great cities of the Earth—
LONDON, PARIS, NEW YORK, CONSTANTINOPDE, PETROGRAD,
BERLIN, and every city on the face of the Earth (Rome is already destroyed
before this happens), scarcely one stone being left upon another (see Rev.,
c. 14, v. 19). All our inventions that we pride ourselves upon will be lost in
the universal Ruin of Fire and Earthquake. All this present Civilisation will
blotted out, and a NEW SOCIAL ORDER and Government will be set up
“the MILLENNIUM” will come in under the PERSONAL RULERSHIP and
REIGN of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, “the KING of Kings,” and “LORD of
Loids, and RULER of all Princes,” and He shall reign absolutely for 1000
years with his Apostles and Believers on Earth.
“Yet the End shall be at the time Appointed” (Dan., c. 11, vs. 27, 29).
