lIHE Football Season of J 913 will long be remembered
S in the Goulburn Valley as one of the most re-
/ markable since the formation of the Association.
The rapid rise of Rochester after a most dis-
couraging start, their great victory over the long in-
vincible Shepparton, the tremendous struggle tor
supremacy between the two clubs in the final, and last
but certainly not least, the great victory won by
Shepparton over South Bendigo, combined to make up
a season's play long - to be remembered.
Shepparton winner of six premicrships since 1906
and unbeaten \9\\ and \9\ 2, went down at last before
Rochester in their thirteenth match in- \9\Z, and a fort-
night later were again defeated by Echuca.
Despite these reverses, however, Shepparton finished
up the season in a blaze of glory by two great victories
over Rochester and South Bendigo, the manner in which,
by superior coolness and judgment, they truimphed over
teams at least fully equal to them in all other respects,
fully compensating them for their previous defeats.
The following are the results of the season's play

THE DOWNFALL OF SHEPPARTON.
AUGUST 20, 1913.
The Gou'lburn Valley district,
For football long renowned,
lias splendid teams, and wealthy clubs,
And many a pleasant ground;
Old Shepparton, lord of the Valley,
Has long maintained its sway,
It?s teams have mighty champions proved
In many a stubborn fray.
Six times they?ve won the premiership,
Three years unbeaten proved,
In three and forty matches
Their colors stood unmoved
And fondly their supporters hoped
This year to see again,
Their great unbeaten record
Emerge without a stain.
New blood was in the Valley,
For Rochester was there ?
A rising team of eager lads,
With lots of men to spare.
Though little hopes of premiership
Their opening games displayed.
Though bad their start and worse their
luck,
Our lads wore not dismayed.
Four games were lost in the opening round
And a single match was won;
It seemed they?d fill.the lowest place,
When all their work was done.
Hut when the second round began,
A different tale was told,
For victory smiled in kindlier mood
Upon our champions bold.
We lost one match ?at Shepparton?
It caused us no despair.
For we?d never practised swimming,
We found ?twas needed there!


HOW THE GOULBURN VALEEV PREMIERSHIP WAS WON
When Shepparton came to Rochester
For the third and final game,
They brought to the field of battle
A story of splendid fame.
Twelve victories won that season
Attest their skill and pluck,
And who will say, with that display,
Thirteen brings no ill luck?
They started the game with a mighty
charge,
And fiercely upon us rushed;
Four goals were kicked in no time,
Our lads were simply crushed.
Though Tiny Bennett did wondrous things,
The enemy rushed them, through.
O?Neill and Freeman were overborne,
And things were looking blue,
For Burns, McGaskill and Florence
Their fiercest charges led;
And /Shepparton finished Hie quarter
Twenty-five points ahead!
Ho, Rochester! Ho, Rochester!
Is this the way you play?
Shake up your team, my lads, and change
The fortunes of the fray!
Again the Shepparton fellows charged,
But Miles O?Neill was there,
And twice in succession he saved the goal
With precious little to spare.
Fierce was the Shepparton rally,
But Rochester hurled them back;
Again and again, round the Shepparton
goal,
Attack succeeded attack.
Then Doyle emerged from a scrimmage,
And hoisted a lovely goal;
Around the Shepparton fortress
The tides of battle roll.
Frank Ding secured a minor point,
Fitzgerald notched a six;


THE GOULBURN VALLEY PREMIERSHIP WAS WON
And Doyle got in a beauty,
Which passed between the sticks.
Fitzgerald scored a single,
And Shanahan passed to Mills,
And the roar which told of another goal,
The air with music fills!
Our fellows were playing the game of their
lives,
But Shepparton rallied up.
With one more effort, their last and best,
They snatched at victory?s cup;
But a single point was all they scored,
So fierce was their charge opposed.
And Rochester finished a point to the good
When the second quarter closed.
Half-time was called, and they left the
ground,
?Mid torrents of pouring rain,
From which the Shepparton players hoped
They would all the advantage gain-
But alas, alas, for their cherished hopes
The quarter had scarce begun
When McNaught secured the ball again,
With a fast and brilliant run
He passed it safely along to Moore,
Who put it between the sticks;
And mighty Shepparton found themselves
In a most unwonted fix.
They forced the ball to the other end,
But never a point could score,
And the quarter ended in brilliant style,
With a couple of points by Moore.
In the final quarter the Shepparton lads,
In trouble were found again.
They had failed to Lake advantage
Of the steadily pouring rain.
McNaught secured a minor point
And the end of the game was near,
With mighty Shepparton, sorely pressed,
Eleven points in arrear


HOW THB GOULkURN VALLEY PREMIERSHIP WAS Wok
Then Doyle got in with another goal,
Fitzgerald a single scored;
And Shepparton saw with sadness,
Their record go by the board.
I hey took their beating like sportsmen
time, and never a word would say.
In the bitterness of that great defeat,
Against their foemen?s play.
I?m sorry for Shepparton .fellows,
Reverses are bad enough
\\ hen they come about once a fortnight or
It must be awfully rough
To be licked at the end of a season,
With two more teams to meet,
And a shining record of forty wins,
Two years without defeat.
? ? ,
hen the Rochester players ar e old and
grey,
And all of them past their prime;
They?ll sit in a corner and watch the play
And talk of the olden time;
And oft when the battle is fierce and long,
They'll see in a misty dream,
The light in the rain when they first put
through,
The mighty Shepparton team!


HOW THE GOULBURN VALLEY PREMIERSHIP WAS WON
WHEN RUSTY KICKED A GOAL.
ROCHESTER V. KYABRAM, SEPTEMBER
3rd, 1913.
ROCHESTER WON BY FOUR POINTS.
O?er all the world the sun set red,
The moon had screamed and flown;
The wind was hushed, the ocean still?d,
Where?er the news was known.
Dumb was the follower?s voice?
Paralysed every soul;
The flags went floating to the sky?
For Rusty kicked a goal!
Kyabram saw and wondered,
They knew their cake was dough;
Nothing could now prevent defeat,
No skill avert the blow.
Writ large in fiery letters
On Fate?s relentless scroll,
?The enemy?s doomed to failure
?When Rusty kicks a goal!?
Brightened now and shiny,
The rust no longer clings;
It reflects hi s noble features,
As the cup he homeward brings.
Some may claim that credit
Is due to the team as a whole,
But ?twas due to Luck and Rusty
Who kicked that famous goal I
1 knew the time was coming,
When the nineteenth man we?d play,
A shadowy form that followed
Old Rusty day by-day.
At last a lucky favor,
From his hag ho did unroll,
For ?twas Luck that sent it forward ,
When Rusty kicked a goal!

HOW THE GOULBURN VALLEY PREMIER-
SHIP WAS WON.
ROCHESTER V. SHEPPARTON.
PIjAYEI) AT EGHUGA, SEPTEMBER 24, 1913.
There were anxious faces in Shepparton
For the final was drawing near.
Our champions thought of the coming fray
With feelings akin to fear.
For a cloud arose in the western sky,
No bigger than Darcy?s hand,
And filling the heavens as time went on.
Cast shadows across the land.
Our team of mighty champions
Had met their match at last,
Our days of unbeaten glory
Were numbered with the past.
Two western teams had thrashed us.
And one could do it again,
With the least suspicion of better luck
Or the help of a shower of rain.
And rain was coming; for days it fell?
' There were prophets of evil found;
We didn?t want to meet Rochester lads
Again on a sodden ground!
But the weather cleared and the skies were
bright,
Three days ere the match was played;
And the ground at Echuca was at its best,
Tn loveliest green arrayed.
Our lads had trained for the struggle,
As never they?d trained before,
For the Rochester fellows had thrashed us well
And we longed to repay the score.


[HOW THE GOULBtjRN VALLEY PREMIERSHIP WAS WON
When the teams lined up for the tussle,
1 tell you we opened our eyes
To see Les Robbins among the crowd,
It gave us a real surprise.
We felt it would take us just all we knew,
To save ourselves from disgrace,
For a team that can leave out a man like him
is a mighty order to face.
in the opening quarter we started well,
And had Rochester lads on toast,
For Connors secured the opening goal,
And afterwards struck the post.
Whitfield and Jones, by splendid play,
Put a sixer each on the board;
And for Rochester fellows, a goal by Wade,
And some minor points were scored.
We had gained a lead of eleven points,
And remembering the game before,
When we lost after leading by twenty-live,
We wished Twas a trifle more.
In the second quarter they pulled us down,
As everyone feared they would do;
Though Kittle secured two goals for us,
?Twas hard to put them through.
Time after time O?Neill and Green
.lust managed our lads to foil;
And a goal apiece for the foe was scored
By Moore, McNaught and Doyle.
Our lead was reduced to seven points,
and Darcy?s face was grave;
He told us we?d have to do belter than that,
If we wanted the match to save.
But the quarter which followed was worst of all
They hurled our charges back;
Not a goal did we score for the quarter,
While many a fierce attack
Was driven home through our best defence,
In spilt' of all wo could do,
And Doyle and Wade for the Rochester lads,
Each booted a sixer through.


iiow the gouLburn vaiTey Premiership was won
With an uphill task, four points to the bad,
We started the closing round;
Cloudlet, whose arm was badly hurt,
Was forced to leave the ground.
The foemen came with a mighty rush,
McNaught a minor scored,
And Doyle securing a pass from Mills,
Put a lovely six on the hoard.
?Twas his forty-second goal for the year,
And was nearly too many for us,
What Darcy said to us I?l not repeat,
There was reason for making a fuss!
But 1 never liked Shepparton fellows more,
Than I did in that evil hour,
As they pulled together and showed the crowd
The value of staying power.
?Twas pluck, endurance and judgment,
That pulled them safely through;
But Twas time we put Rochester lads in their
place,
And showed them what we could do.
If they?d been content to hold their ground
And keep the advantage gained,
I doubt if our lads could have turned the scale
In the time which still remained.
But they?d made the pace too hot to last,
?Twas clear their bolt was sped;
And Whitfield got in a hrace of goals
Which placed us a point ahead.
Two more were added, then Darcy did,
What Mills should have done before,
Called back his men to defend the goal,
Without waiting to add to the score.
McCaskell, Morris and Cliddy Ware,
W ere making a splendid show.
Kittle secured a point for us,
And Pattinson one for the foe;
But the Rochester fellows wore tired out,
While most of our lads were fresh,
Though the spirit plainly was willing
Too weak was the weary flesh!


Mow O'h� GOUr.BURN VACUItY PREMIERSHIP WAS WON
?Twas anyone?s game to the very end,
Their efforts did not cease;
Though Maskell, Connors and Whitfield scored
A minor point apiece.
Never was bell more welcome
Than the one which closed the round,
And Shepparton, lords of the Valley still,
Six points to the good were found!
So ended the famous struggle,
As Shepparton once again
With the pennant still in their keeping,
Went home by the evening train.
There was cheering along the Valley,
As the train swept merrily by,
Kyabram, Tatura, Mooroopna -
Each gave us a passing cry.
There was wild excitement in Shepparton,
As pouring out of the train,
The champions of Goulbum Valley brought,
The premiership home again.
We're proud of the game, and with reason,
?Twas the finest we?ve ever played;
No team that we?ve ever encountered,
Has such resistance made.
We?ll give our foes full credit
For the mighty work they've done;
?Twas the greatest of many victories
That Shepparton lads have won!
Had the Rochester fellows come out on top,
And first on the list have led,
Two-thirds of them couldn?t have worn their
hats
For at least six months ahead.
And that sort of thing would hardly do
With the summer so near at hand,
So perhaps that?s the reason why Fortune
frowned
On a most deserving band.
But we hope to meet them again next year,
And we?ll wish them the best of luck,
Though they?re far and away the toughest
snags,
Old Shepparton ever struck!

HOW THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF THE NORTH
WAS WON.
SHEPPARTON v. SOUTH BENDHiO.
PLAYED AT EG HUG A OCTOBER 8, 1913.
The football season was over,
The winter?s work was done,
With Shepparton lords of the Valley still,
The final was lost and won;
Though Rochester players bid high for fame,
And fully their mettle proved,
Though once they lowered the premier?s flag,
The pennant remained unmoved?
Still proudly flying in Shepparton town,
The final was fierce and keen.
But the championship of the Valley still
as where it had always been!
From Bendigo city their strongest team,
To the town of Echuca came,
To wage with the lads from the Valley
A struggle of splendid fame;
Both sides were keen on winning,
The championship of the North.
\\ ith ardour keen, to the Oval green,
Each team went gaily forth.
We opened smartly with three hehinds,
Though one of them touched the post.
Then the Bendigo players upon our goal
Game down in a mighty host;


HOW THE GOULBURN VALLEY PREMIERSHIP WAS WON
Brady secured a six for them,
Another one seemed in store,
When Burns, O?Hare, and Geisler saved,
And Bendigo failed to score.
We carried the ball to the other end,
And Sandilands kicked a goal,
And after adding a single,
Put another six on the roll.
The Shepparton marking was splendid,
And Bendigo?s onslaught failed,
While Kittle securing a pass from Ware,
Another six was hailed!
Ritchie from near the centre gave Timms a
chance in front,
But only a single to Bendigo came, then Slat-
tery bore the brunt,
Of a mighty Shepparton rally,
While Maui marked from Wright,
And raised two flags for the Bendigo lads,
Still fiercer grew the light.
Brady had scored another six.
Ere the quarter had reached its close,
And we finished wih Shepparton leading,
Three points ahead of their foes.
?Twas the final with Rochester over again,
But Darcy ordered a rush;
And we put every ounce of weight we had
In an effort our foes to crush.
McGaskill marked from Florence,
And hoisted a lovely six;
And Masked scored with a flying shot
Which passed between the sticks.
At long-range kicidng we had them beat,
But Forbes took a mark from Gox;
And raised two flags for the Bendigo lads
With a trimmer out of the box.
Morris was playing a wondrous game
For a youngster still in his teens;
McGaskill, Darcy and Pattison
Were giving the foemen beans.
A mighty charge on the Bendigo goal
Was made by the Shepparton men,
