Symphytum Asperrimum (Prickly Comfrey.)
My dear Sir Hercules,
My attention having been attracted some fifteen or
sixteen months ago to the Prickly Comfrey by a short article in
the Country Gentleman s Magazine, I determined at once to intro-
duce it into this colony; and though my first efforts were ineffec-
tual, owing to the miscarriage of the letter containing the order
for the roots for planting, it was not until after the arrival of
the “ Whampoa” on the 15th of July in the present year, that I
was in the position of being able to plant them in my garden.
Unfortunately, out of 600 root-cuttings ordered, not one-half
arrived in a sound and healthy condition—sufficient, however,
were fertile, and the experiment which I am now trying will
show me and my agricultural friends whether this extraordinary
plant can be grown to advantage and acclimatized here. I can only
say, from information I have before me, that if I succeed, it will
be the greatest blessing ever conferred upon agriculturists and
graziers in dry and droughty seasons. Imagine this perennial


plant producing the first year as much as twenty tons to the
acre ; the second fifty, and every year after from eighty to one
hundred and twenty tons—but if the authorities upon which I rely
are to be believed, this enormous production will be realized.
I have addressed this letter to yoiir Excellency as President of
the Agricultural Society of New South Wales, and prior to laying
before you the history of Prickly Comfrey—its simple cultiva-
tion, its extraordinary production, and its manifold uses—l think
it right to say that the following remarks must be considered a
compilation and arrangement of materials which I have obtained
from several sources. A few months, however, will be sufficient
to test its qualities. I have plants in full leaf and apparently
doing well, and if the annual crops with me are only half of
Avhat they are represented to be in England, I shall be satisfied
with the result, and more than compensated for its introduction.
It is uncertain when the Prickly Comfrey— the Symphytum
Asperrimvm of Botanists —was introduced into England. It is a
native of the Caucasus, One author believes that it was brought
over in 1799, but I think that there is little doubt now that “ it
was originally introduced into England by the Messrs. Loddiges
in 1811, its bright blue-bell flowers and fine foliage seeming to
recommend it as a showy adjunct in the shrubbery or larger
flower border. Somewhere about 1850 it was recommended to
the farmer as a green soiling plant, capable of affording a large
quantity of nutritive and relishing food, especially good for cattle.”
Country Gentleman's Magazine.
The Treasury of Botany informs us that ; —“ Its graceful pendent
light-blue flowers and bold foliage recommended it as an orna-
mental plant in spacious flower-gardens or the front of the shrub-
bery, in which it has to a greater or less extent kept a place in old
gardens, but some few years ago it was recommended as a green
‘ soiling ’ plant.”
Mr. Stephen Shilling of Teddington, Middlesex, tells us that
“ The true sort of Prickly Comfrey is a Perennial Herbaceous
Plant, a native of the Caucasus, and perfectly hardy. It belongs
to the family of Anchusa or Borage plant. It is safe as a food,
and non-poisonous in all its stages of growth. The leaves are
greyish-green, rough in texture, elongated like the Fox Glove
( Digitalis Purpurea), but much larger, and throwing up several
hollow stems. The flowers are produced on the points of the
stem, small in size, blue colour, only four seeds in a small capsule.


The seeds are rarely known to be fertile when raised in England,
unless impregnated with pollen of Symphytum Officinale or Com-
mon Gomfrey, a native of Britain, a worthless plant which no
domestic animal will touch.”
Prickly Comfrey has been some years established in Ireland and
in some parts of England, and is grown extensively by Mr.
Kinard Edwards, at Hinckley, in Leicestershire.
The following is the result of ap analysis of Symphytum
Asperrimum by Professor Voelcker: —

On comparison, the above figures will show this plant to be
almost equal to some of our more important green food crops : and
certainly if we take into consideration the quantity of its produce,
there are few plants capable of yielding so much of green food as
the Comfrey. Dr. Yoelcker says, that “ the amount of flesh form-
ing substances is considerable. Hie juice of this plant contains
much gum and mucilage, and but little sugar. —( Treasury of
Botany.)
Mr. Thomas Christy, of 155, Fenchurch-street, London, fur-
nishes us with the following particulars :
“ Prickley Comfrey being a d<ep rooted plant, is not dependent
on weather and climate, and it will afford several cuttings when
other vegetation is either burnt up or at a stand-still.
The cultivation of Comfrey is the next point to be considex-ed j
and here we have a plant with enormous powers of production
giving us apparently little ti-ouble in growing it, in almost anj
soil, in all climates, and under all conditions. If a quarter of an
acre of ground is set apart in a suburban garden, sufficient
forage can be obtained to maintain a cow and a hoi’se all the yeai'
rouxid, and keep the family in good, rich, wholesome milk (“ no
sky blue”), and butter of superior quality to what is obtained from
the gi’ocer.


“ Gentlemen who have grown Comfrey for twenty years in Eng-
land, say they get better and richer milk from their cows, and a
higher price for their butter.”
I am sure the extracts which I am about to give will prove the
valuable acquisition of keeping a cow cheaply by a suburban
resident.
After the ground has been properly prepared, the roots may
be subdivided and planted in all but the dry season of the year.
In Europe this plant cannot be cultivated from seed. Mr. H.
Doubleday, of Coggeshall, Essex, took a great deal of pains to test
the fertility of the seed. He says, “ I would not hybridize or have
any inferior variety near them ; I sowed the seed under all condi-
tions, and under glass, and in the open ground ; I only obtained a
score or two on a considerable space of ground under glass, and
kept very moist a few more. My opinion is, that there are a few
fertile seeds, but certainly not one per cent; but as the root cut-
tings are so successful, we have ample means of increase.”
I began thus:—l forked my ground ten inches deep, I opened
a small trench and forked the bottom six inches deeper. I then
put on the bed a good covering of stable and farm manure, I mixed
this well with the soil having scattered a little bone dust upon it;
I next planted the root cuttings or sets, two feet apart, in the rows,
and the rows two feet apart also ; but I see already that the ground
could be worked more advantageously to the plants, if the plants
and rows were three feet apart instead of two, and where space of
ground is no object, I should recommend it. I intend to do so in
future. If this latter suggestion be adopted, 1,000 root-cuttings
will occupy a quarter of an acre. My ground being ready, I took
out a handful of soil where each set was to be planted, put a little
moist sand in the hole and planted a root-cutting in it three
inches deep. I selected moist ground. I keep the ground clean
and free from weeds; in two or three weeks after planting, leaves
like Foxglove appeared.
A writer in the Field, of December 17th, IS 70, states : —“ It is
nearly forty years since my attention was directed to Prickly
Comfrey ; its excellences as a food for cattle, its specialities, the
chief of which is its rapid and continuous reproduction.
“ I procured in the year I spoke of (about 1832) twenty-five sets
of the Prickly Comfrey taken immediately from the plant grown
on the spot. I know nothing at all comparable to it to set before
cattle for nourishment. The weight of each leaf will be somewha


more than an ounce. When the whole crown was taken at once, it
was reproduced in the short space of ten or twelve days in the
summer time, and in a fortnight or little more in late spring and
autumn.
“As to the place where Prickly Comfrey is to he planted, any
soil seems to suit it. I have, where lam at present, two spots
where it is planted ; one, an open sunny place on almost a sand ;
the other, a stiff clay against a north wall; and they seem to do
nearly equally well in both. My notion is that the plant derives
a good deal of nourishment from its decayed leaves in autumn,
which I have always left.”
Any soil but chalk suits it. Spring is the most proper time
for planting in England, but no month comes amiss with it unless
mid-winter, when the frost might kill the fresh planted roots.
When Mr. Doubleday first divided his roots about four years
ago, he planted his root cuttings experimentally. He says, “ I
found these grew satisfactorily in a very peculiar way ; a circle of
leaves was produced around the top of the inner bark of the root,
while the root fibres formed all over the under bark. The next
season I cut the roots into smaller pieces, and these also all grew in
asimilar way; but I found this difference between the cut roots and
the divided crowns—the former only produced leaves the first
season, the latter perfect blossoming plants. My experience in
feeding on a small scale was quite satisfactory. Lambs and pigs
were extremely fond of it and did well ; they are also very fond of
it in the dry state. My land is a heavy clay on which the Comfrey
grows luxuriantly, the roots striking down deep into the ground.
Last year (1875), my first cut was from three to four feet high
(plants three feet apart), some producing lOlbs. each plant, or
tons per acre, at the first cut 15th May.”
Mr. Stephen Shilling has supplied some valuable information
on tile Prickly Comfrey in the Live Stock Journal and Finder s
Gazette. In writing on planting he says, “In selecting sets, bear
in mind that the small root sets, or pieces of the roots become far
more productive than old crowns, although the crowns are appa-
rently much stronger. It is the same with young vines raised
from eyes, which are far more robust and productive than vines
raised from layering or cuttings taken 6 to 10 inches long from
old wood.”
From Mr. Edwards I gather further that “ Prickly Comfrey
possesses many advantages over other plants in common use. It


affords a catting earlier and lasts longer than almost any other.
If cultivated upon a good deep soil, it will yield a heavier crop
than any other plant; and when once planted, it will last for ever.
It is very hardy, and is found to produce heavy crops upon any
dry soil, although poor and unsheltered.”
In comparison with the yield of other green soiling plants,
according to Mr. T. Christy, it stands thus in England :
Good grass land cut green yields.. 8 Tons to the acre
Lucerne .. .. . i 40 ~
Rye Grass .. .. .. 50
\ T plphpo 20
Prickly Comfrey'’ ..’ 80 to 120
Mr. Edwards cuts his plants when the stems grow to a height
of two or three feet, and before the blossom opens. “In about
six weeks a second cutting may be obtained, and so on throughout
the summer ; each time affording from 10 to 15 tons of forage to
the acre. The first year as much as twenty tons may be obtained ;
the second year fifty ; and every year after, eighty to one hundred
tons. But to do this it will be necessary to lay on a heavy amount
of manure, as in this respect Comfrey is no exception to the rule
which demands an equivalent being returned to the soil to keep
up its fertility.”
Mr. Edwai-ds then goes on to say, “ I have, during the last four
years, cut from 80 to 100 tons to the acre, some cuttings rising to
a height of five feet, each plant averaging lOlbs. to 121bs to the
cut. It may be cut with a hook, tied up in bundles, and so carried
to the stall or farmstead as required, day by day ; and for amateurs
and cottagers having a horse, cow, or pigs to feed, few crops will
be found so useful or more easily cultivated. A few hundreds of
root cuttings will suffice to make a start, as every spring the roots
may be raised and divided into twelve parts, and twelve times the
area of ground planted.”
Further interesting information about Prickly Comfrey is found
in the recently published pamphlet of Messrs. Thomas Christy and
Co., of London. From it I glean that “ the plants spread in size
of crown each time they are cut, and the forage may be taken all
the year round to within three inches of the ground. The yield
is largest if cut before it opens into flower. It likes moist, boggy
places, and the roots will tap down many feet in open soil to
moisture. At Kew, they found the roots of an old plant of
Si/mjthyfum Asjaerrimum had penetrated nine feet down, when


moved in 1875. The roots sometimes globe, and hold half a pint
to a pint of gummy water. It may be planted in valleys, and at
the sides of rivers ; and, it is believed will, with its mass of roots,
retain the moisture in the ground through the dry season.”
Prickly Comfhev, when cut.
Mr. W. Doubleday “ thinks the Symphytum Aspennmutn will
prove a highly valuable plant for India quite a mine of wealth
for the farmers who keep cattle. Its extreme luxuriance, and its
power of withstanding a long drought mark it out for such a
climate.” If this opinion is worth anything, and I submit that it is,
what a valuable plant Comfrey will be in Hew South Wales—a few
acres on a large run will keep cattle and sheep from starving, but
if grown in sufficient quantities, will prevent them losing condition.
Again, Mr. T. Christy says : “To ensure a large yield, if the
crop cannot be cut quickly enough for green food, it ought not to
be allowed to run up too high and flower, but should be cut down,
and the branches and leaves made into bundles, which, when dried,


keep well as forage, and is excellent tor horses, cattle, sheep, and
pigs.” And adds that “ the plants arc capable of being dried for
winter use, when they will be found to retain all the qualities of
the abundant mucilage which is the chief characteristic of the
plant—Milk cows thrive upon it, and their constitution is improved
in a very remarkable degree. Pigs fatten by Comfrey leaves being
mixed with their food, either in the green or dry state, or when
boiled with the ordinary food.”
Mr. Edwards observes that “ it is much relished by horses, cows ,
sheep, pigs, rabbits and poultry. Horses are found to work wel 1
upon it, and are not soft as on other green food ”
In a letter of Mr. Christy’s of the 6th of November, 1875, he
calls attention to the fact, that “it is stated that cattle reject
Prickly Comfrey owing to the prickly nature of the matured
leaves. This is quite possible, but it can be easily remedied by
offering at first a few of the younger and more tender portions of
the foliages, the animals soon learn to discriminate and no other
food will be held in such esteem.
“ Others again have pointed out that owing to the heavy crop
produced, it is only natural to suppose that the soil in which they
grow will soon become exhausted and incapable of producing any-
thing like the quantity stated in after years. This is a mistake—
K. B. B. writing in December, 1870, says, ‘ The plant thrives
equally well in deep loam and in high sandy soil, and derives
most of its sustenance from moisture, sending its massive roots
deep down in search of food, and it only needs the decayed leaves
produced by itself which remain uncollected together with such
trifling additions of coarse manure as may be distributed during
the winter in the form of top-dressing.’
“ In a Clergyman’s plantation where it did well, it was supposed
to have been introduced from France. He gave it to his cow, a
fine, young animal of large size, which had not long calved. The
calf was sent to a farm, the Hector requiring all the milk and
butter that could be had for his family and household, which was
large. The cow when fed on Symphytum Asperrimum gave 36
quarts of milk every 24 hours (was thrice milked), being an in-
crease of rather more than 12 quarts on what she had given pre-
viously, from which a good quantity of splendid butter was made
twice a week, and new milk was used freely in the family. The
Clergyman’s horses, donkey, pigs, rabbits, &c., all fed on it and did
well. The growth, three cuttings in the season, was carefully


estimated to weigh at the rate of 86 tons per acre. On a rich
deep soil 100 tons and upwards may be depended on from 20 to
25 years by a very trifling expense being increased each year.”
A writer in the Country Gentleman s Magazine mentions that
“ his cows ate the Prickly Comfrey greedily and used to follow us
about the fields as it were begging for it, and it seemed that it was
not only highly relished by these stall cattle and pigs, but with
all kinds of stock it seemed to act most favourably.”
The writer in the Field “ knows nothing at all comparable to
Prickly Comfrey to set before cattle for nourishment. If they do
not take to it at first they soon come round to it. Where
cows are kept there is nothing probably that can be so advan-
tageously placed before them when they are tied up for milking.
He has been in the habit of giving horses that were kept in the
stable in the summer a daily allowance of 8 lbs. with very good
effect. They become very fond of it. It keeps them cool, and is
a diuretic"
Several French agriculturists in bearing testimony to the great
service it has rendered, report that the crops have been heavy, and
more land is being devoted to its culture.
I have now shown how Prickly Comfrey can be used among
healthy stock, but it still remains to be seen what a valuable
remedy it is in disease, and though its medicinal properties have
only been recently brought into notice, and the materials for show-
ing its effect on disease limited, I think I shall make out a case for
further inquiry and investigation. If it is not in all cases a com-
plete preventative of foot and mouth disease it is a palliative, and
further experiments may probably prove that it may be applied
successfully to Pleuropneumonia.
The true Symphytum Asperrimum is diuretic. “ Hence,” says
Mr. T. Christy, “it prevents fever, and cattle fed upon this plant
are free from the ravages of lung and foot-and mouth-d iseases, and
are strongly fortified against infection ; its curative properties
have been long known. It has been held in high esteem as a
simple and efficacious remedy for chest and lung complaints. The
simple extract is administered to children and adults as a tea, or
in the form of a jelly or drops made from the gum by boiling the
roots.”
Mr. Shilling’s remarks upon the medicinal properties of Prickly
Comfrey are important, and will be read with interest. “ For
horses and cattle in cases of constipation or incipient fret, known


as colic or gripes which some horses are very subject to after
having worked very hard or been a long time without food or
water) it has been used with the best results, acting as a solvent
on the system, as well as on the bowels and urinary passages. No
establishment whatever with the slightest pretentions to economy
and real management should be without a good plantation of this
plant near the homestead. After three or four consecutive feeds
the animals will not fail (the horses particularly) to remind you
that its feeds are deficient in quality should you fail to replenish
it with this green herbage. He will eat it with the same avidity
as green clover or tares —cattle of all classes will thrive and fatten
on it. For horses with broken wind, or when they have had a
chill in the blood after been much heated by hard driving, which
often produces a surfeit or scurf disease on the skin, very hard to
cure as well as being irritating to the horse as soon as harnessed,
the writer has known more, good result by feeding with this
herbage, and mucilage extract in the feeds of corn, than all the
nostrums devised in the shape of powders with nitre, itc., and
given as diuretics and ‘ skin cleansers,' which are ruinous to the
horse’s constitution.”
In a letter from Mr. W. Brabason of Dublin to Mr. Christy so
late as February in the present year, Mr. Brabason says, “ 1 had
a valuable hunter, who after a severe cold broke out with Button
farcy and nearly died ; he was cured at a veterinary hospital and
sent home a miserable object, his coat all covered with dried scabs
and scarcely able to walk. My steward being afraid to put
him out to grass had him put into a detached stable where
he was loose and allowed nothing but Prickly Comfrey, which at
that time (first week in May) was in blossom. A t first the horse
would hardly eat it, but in a couple of weeks he would come neighing
to his stable door at feeding time. At last the boy attending him
told my steward that the horse was (to use a phrase) jumping
out of his skin.’ I came down to the country at this time and
went to see the horse \ his old coat was now falling off him in
great flakes, and under it he had a beautiful new coat like velvet ;
at the end of two months on this food he was perfectly recovered
and in splendid condition. I find this is first-rate food for cairiage
horses"—that is to give two good feeds of it daily along with a very
small quantity of hay and their usual measure of oats, as it never
purges, and gives them a very fine coat.” Mr. Brabason con-
clucfes by adding, “ 1 think the Prickly Comfrey would be invaluable
as food for brood mares.”


A correspondent of Mr. Christy’s, who withholds his name, but
whose nom cte plume is “ W. Xj. C.,” furnished him, in October,
1875, with the following interesting information on the use of
Prickly Comfrey in connection with the Foot-and-Mouth-Dis-
ease;—“ I have eight dairy cows ; one was affected with Foot-
and-Mouth-Disease on the Bth of September last. I immediately
drenched her and all the others, giving each from lb. to 1 lb. of
Epsom salts dissolved with j lb. of treacle in hot water. On the
9th another was affected, and a third on the 10th, and three
others a few days afterwards. One of these three, an Alderney,
was well on the 13th; very ill, with heavy discharge from her
mo\ith, and very lame, on the 14th ; and on the 15th had re-
covered, never showing any lessening of her milk. Two of the
eight have escaped altogether, and under circumstances which lead
me to believe that the distemper is not infectious. While five of
the six cows were at the worst (they had it very lightly), finding
they could not bite grass, I pulled mangold leaves, which, as the
cows opened their mouths to lick them, I contrived to push far
back on the tongue, when they would eat them, and after tasting
one or two, would pick up and eat any I threw ■to them. Some
of these leaves, after rolling about in their mouths, they would
drop, and these were picked up and eaten by the two non-affected
cows. Believing then the disease to be infectious, I concluded
that after eating leaves covered with saliva of infected animals,
these two would not escape ; but as they have, I came to the
conclusion that the disease is due to some peculiar condition of
the atmosphere, and to certain conditions also of the animals ren-
de ring themselves liable to develope the disease. I attribute the
mildness of the attack in my animals to their having been
drenched as soon as the complaint appeared, and also to the use of
Prickly Comfrey, |with which they havo been fed at midday for
some months. As Comfrey is said to be valuable as a febrifuge,
and as it also affords much mucilaginous food, I have no doubt
that its influence is great in lessening the violence of this com-
plaint, and keeping up a healthy condition in all animals fed upon
it. I planted rather less than half an acre of Comfrey in March
last (1875), have cut four crops from it; and although the plants
have not grown to one-fourth of what they promise to be, I am
surprised by the very large yield of food they have given , I am
about to enlarge the planting to one acre, and expect when it has
fully developed, that it will keep my eight cows for six months in
the year.”
Once more I must refer to Mr. K-inard Edwards, “ the Apostle


of Prickly Comfrey,” who confirms in a manner
“ W. L. C.’s” opinion of the prophylactic or preventative powers of
the Prickly Comfrey. “ Long before Comfrey was utilised as a forage
plant,” says Mr. Edwards, “ its medical and curative properties in
allaying fever, &c., were very well known, mention of this fact
being found in most of the leading botanical and medical works
which describe the plant. In confirmation of the remarks of
‘ W. L. C.,’ I may state that lately I turned a cow, which I have
occasionally fed with Comfrey during the past two summers,
amongst a herd of 18 or 20 other cows, all of which were bad with
the Foot-and-Mouth disease, and although she has now been
feeding in company with these cows for six weeks, she continues
perfectly healthy. I believe in a very few years Comfrey will be
as generally cultivated as vetches and lucerne—certainly to the
extent of an acre or so being established adjoining the farm
buildings where it can be readily cut and carried to the stalls for
the use of store stock. 1 ’
“ Gerade gives, as his wont is, a recipe for a syrup—main
compound being Comfrey—use internal. Its mucilaginous cha-
racter points to the source of its value in cases of Lung, Foot, or
Mouth Diseases.”
“ Gerade recommends it highly as a salve for external wounds,
for internal hemorrhage, and for disorder of the kidneys.”—
Herlal p.p. 806, 807.
In the correspondence respecting this most valuable plant
(Prickly Comfrey) one important use has been overlooked,
namely, as the plant affording the best cover for game, especially
in dry summers when there is a scarcity of root crops. Game of
all kinds harbour in it, and rabbits cannot eat it down owing to
its rapid growth. The plant is a very sightly object on the farm
or preserve.
You must have perceived by the evidence I have placed before
you the great importance of introducing generally the Prickly
Comfrey as a soiling plant, but as it may be attended with delay in
procuring roots or root cuttings, and as I have no selfish object in
view, but a desire to see this extraordinary plant extensively
cultivated, I think it but right to add that the materials for propaga-
tion can be procured from Messrs. Thomas Christy and Co., 155
Fenchurch-street, London, who are in communication with the
Agricultural and Horticultural Societies in London and Alnwick,
who supply roots after being grown and tested by some of their


Members of Council —and from Mr. Kinard Edwards, of Hinckley,
Leicestershire. Those which I have growing were from the latter
gentleman, and the roots having been subdivided and packed in a
moist state, more than half were rotton and useless when they
arrived. In sending for sets I should recommend that the roots
should be sent out entire, packed in dry sand, or in a felt-lined
case, as recommended by Messrs. Christy and Co., and subdivided
after arrival.
I have now laid before your Excellency all the information I
have been able to procure in reference to this interesting plant.
I have thought this preferable to any speculative theories of my
own. lam aware that I am guilty of prolixity in citing many
passages at length, but in doing so I have given greater scope for
reflection. I was astonished and surprised when I first read about
Comfrey, and my first impressions have been confirmed by the
authorities I have met with since. I believe that it will be in-
valuable to farmers of all classes. A few months —I hope not
later than March next—will enable me to show your Excellency
the forage in a state tit for stock, and if the result should be equal
to what I anticipate, I shall rejoice in having introduced it as a
‘ soiling ” plant in this colony.
I have the honor to remain,
Yours very faithfully,
ARTHUR T. HOLROYD.
