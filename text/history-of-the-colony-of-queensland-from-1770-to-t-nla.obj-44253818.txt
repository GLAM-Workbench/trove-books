PREFACE.
Fifteen" years form a long space in a man’s lifetime ; and during so many
I have been from time to time collecting and collating materials, and en-
deavouring to accomplish the publication of the history which is now sub-
mitted to the public. Four years since a portion was published in one oi
our local journals ; but failing health, and inability to use my right hand,
prevented its completion at the time ; —a circumstance which, however I
may have suffered from its causes, I cannot say that I regret. Time has
been afforded for revision, for additional information, and for the correction
of conclusions which, although not hastily formed, prove to have been
arrived at upon insufficient basis. Nevertheless, the diligence with which
facts had been sought out, and the care with which their alleged authenti-
city was sifted, were, at the time I allude to, admitted by those most en-
titled to express an opinion on such matters ; —the few who, having taken
an active part in the foundation of the colony, survived to witness the
changes which more than a quarter of a century has effected in its position,
and a growth flattering enough to the people, hut owing more to the benefi-
cence of Providence than the foresight or wisdom of man.
The division of the history into two parts was not decided upon with-
out careful consideration. Necessarily the growth of the colony before and
since its separation from New South Wales differs in essential points;—a
difference not so much due to mere alteration in the administration of gov-
ernment as is sometimes supposed. The changes wrought by the develop-
ment of material science within the last few years,' have greatly intensified
those which might have been looked for in the ordinary onward march of
civilisation ; and we have less to create than to follow and grasp the benefits
flowing from the succession of discoveries. Since the year 1859 what mar-
vellous applications of science have we seen ; and we can scarcely appreci-
ate their influence, unless we ask ourselves what, had they not be<:n made,
would most probably have been the position of the colony at the present
hour. But we ought not to be blinded by the glare, however dazzling, of
scientific! light, to the value of the unobtrusive material which in other re-
spects the earlier history of the one time infant settlement offers to us.
Men wrought, toiled, suffered, were mis-governed, and endured; and after


many years, apparently, gained the independence that was the desire of
their hearts. And the student who watches the political discussions which
have now most interest to us will be amused by finding how much of value
in them was initiated in those early days. Our schemes of government, our
theories of finance, our land legislation, our plans of settlement, seem the
echoes, too often faint and feeble, of the voices of those, not in reality so re-
mote, but yet which seem to us, far off years : and when we are most proud
of novelty we are often most certain to have been anticipated in our in-
ventions.
There are, moreover, some features in the early history of Moreton Bay
which cannot be repeated in any attempt at further colonisation; —not
likely to be fettered by such troubles as beset the foundation of the colony
in the obstacles presented by the expiring straggles of the transportation
system. It may be suggested that the narration of those struggles imparts
less of digiiity than degradation in the retrospect; but they left their traces
long after they ended, and they were so much mixed up with the twin con-
test for representative institutions that it is necessary to go into detail to
some extent with respect to its incidents. Nor will the successive changes
which the formation of parliamentary government underwent, from the
time that a fragmentary sort of self rule was first granted, until the final
embodiment of William Wentworth’s most practical views of the Constitu-
tion of New South Wales—the parent of our own—be without interest to
the thoughtful observer : and we shall find that, had the suggestive recom-
mendations fostered by the late Earl Grey been given the weight due to
them, we might have been spared the trouble of discussing federal systems,
and local administration would have long since passed from the region of
experiment to complete fulfilment. These difficulties and fluctuations indi-
cate how important a revolution in the character of the relations of the
mother country with her Australian colonics was, almost without observa-
tion, slowly and surely making its way ; and thus they became of historic
value to ourselves. Age and transition leave an authoritative stamp upon
many circumstances which, from a commercial or presently social point of
view, seem comparatively worthless ; or those researches, which occupy so
much of modern industry and speculation, would be only so many proofs of
the perversion of intellectual power .the who ignores the past simply depre-
cates the value of his own existence to the future. And, apart from the
philosophic interest of the facts presented, there must be the local feeling,
connected with places and persons, incorporated in the recollections of
many of our people,—with the associations and fortunes of the majority,—
the preservation of which, in a permanent form, cannot but he gratifying
to them, of whatever use it may be in educating the rising generation. Of


the few thousands of native Queenslanders living amongst us in 1881,
how many may be supposed to know anything of the history of the country
of their birth? .Yet, surely, if it be essential that they should be certain
how much remains of the old Saxon laws in the British constitution, and
be familiar with the origin of the British nation, it is, at least, equally so
that they should not he left in ignorance—fruitful parent of prejudice—as
to the origin of what may be called their own laws, of the growth of their
own people, and of the foundation of their native laud.
Again, there is much in the history of Australian geographical explora-
tion which belongs to the time before Moreton Bay expanded into Queens-
land. The discoveries of Allan Cunningham, the adventurous journey of
Leiehhardt, the patient perseverance and mournful death of Kennedy, the
keen logical induction and special insight of Clarke, the unruffled endur-
ance of Gregory :—all belong to those early days. In whatever of triumph
is due to the foundation of the colony science surely has her share: whether
that is sufficiently vindicated in this history the reader must judge. If it is
not interesting it will not be from the absence of eminent labourers or
worthy achievement. The fault will rest with the narrative, not with
the work recorded.
I believe that, both in the old country and in the neighboring colonies,
as well as in Queensland, the early incidents of our origin and growth will
furnish a by no means useless contribution to the great store of facts which
concern the general progress of humanity. Unfortunately, few amongst us
have time or opportunity to collect that portion which elucidates either ;
while day by day the sources of information are decreasing, and those who
could either furnish it, or indicate where it could be found, are silently
passing away. Thus believing, and thus regretfully observing, I have col-
lected the material for the first volume, and wrought as I have been enabled
in its arrangement and distribution.
The period since the separation of Moreton Bay from New South Wales
has been one of self-government, and necessarily presenting a species of
facts differing from those found in its predecessor, requires a different kind
of record. We have reached, although few in numbers, a position in the
colonies sufficiently marked to justify more of analysis and loss of narrative
than was thought desirable in the first instance. We have had twenty-one
years of the mimicry of politics, and of the reality of class and personal in-
terests and strife ; we have arrived at the dignity of a public debt equal to
that of some sovereign states of almost secondary eminence, —larger in pro-
portion to our numbers than that of our own neighbours,—and the ques


tionable distinction of being by far the most heavily taxed community in
Australia. We have constructed great public works ; we have manufactured
a statute book which, after two successive purgations, offers the reader four
goodly volumes as the result of a third revision, which, within a very
moderate period, will require revising itself; we have had three or four
systems of laud law, each at first deemed perfection, each in its turn decried
and condemned ; and arc now casting about for another ; and we have still
to discern a plan of immigration which will meet the wants, not only of
labor but of that class of employers having moderate means which forms the
most substantial buttress to the State. And we are on the eve of great
changes. Up to a very recent date, the independence of this colony was,
in some important respects, as I have before suggested, more apparent than
real. It labored, and other men entered into its labors. It had the slightest
direct actual commercial status in the mother country ; its trade was filtered
through New South Wales ; its leading exports found no recognition as from
itself in the European markets ; and its financial concerns were in the hands
of banks and agencies, most of them having preponderating engagements
and connections elsewhere, and looking on our local interests as proportion-
ately subordinate and subsidiary. The first stroke at the fetters thus im-
posed, was the establishment of a local bank ; the second, the securing of a
direct steam service with Great Britain. The effect of the freedom thus
opened to us should be seen in insistance on the quotation of our product as
our own on the London market, and in the initiation of a steady and
efficient and, while continuous, a self regulatory system of immigration.
We are brought into fair contact with the world of commerce, and of
culture as well, and it will be our own fault if we do not avail ourselves of
the opportunity thus presented..
And further, in that extraordinary impetus given to enterprise, in one
direction by the unexpected and simultaneous disclosure in districts widely
apart of enormous mineral wealth—indeed offering “the potentiality of
wealth beyond the dreams of avarice,” —and in another, by the almost sud-
den awakening to the possible magnitude of the sugar industry, there is
sufficient indication that we are emerging from the condition in which weak
and childish localisms can be allowed to interfere with the general progress
and the general good. More, perhaps than either, the discovery of a process
which opens an ever growing market for our flocks and herds, has infused
new life into a pastoral industry which otherwise seemed likely to be suffo-
cated by its own luxuriance of production. The far seeing judgment of
that excellent man, the late Thomas S. Mort, has been vindicated, if not in
the kind of process, amply in the results an efficient one is bringing about:
it being in his case, as in others, that “ wisdom is justified in her children,”


although they may not be permitted to seethe fruition of their labour. 1
speak then but the language of truth and soberness, when I say there is no
country on this eartii—
“ Whatever clime the sun’s bright circle warms ”
more certain, by the prudent use and husbandry of its resources, by bold
and high principled statesmanship, by wise and just legislation, to become
the fair and fruitful and happy home of teeming millions, than this colony
of Queensland. Let me add that there is no country whose future may be
more marred by the greed of classes, or of individuals, who cloak an insatia-
ble avarice of power or wealth beneath the ample folds of an ostensible pa-
triotism ; that there is no country in which it is more necessary to cast class
and even national prejudices on one side, and to remember that if the earth
was created for man to replenish and subdue, the present inheritors of this
vast teritory are not all mankind; nor are the interests of all others of God’s
creatures to be subordinated to what a few thousand souls, scattered over
nearly seven hundred thousand square miles, may be pleased to consider
their own.
Bearing in mind these considerations, 1 have adopted, in the second vol-
ume, a different distribution of matter from that employed in the first. In-
stead of carrying on the narrative generally I divide it under the separate
heads under which, for each subject to be thoroughly understood, it should
naturally fall. Our social progress, our great public works, our state
finance, our land legislation, our agricultural failures, and the advance in
the three great industries which furnish our staple exports, require to be
dealt with from the beginning as, so to speak, separate wholes. The parlia-
mentary history I include in the ordinary narrative; because, when the
legislative procedure which relates to the other subjects is eliminated from
the general record, there is not much to be noticed, and what there is runs
easily enough along with the general current of the history.
I am not unaware of the diffiultios and dangers which may beset a
writer who ventures to bring his narrative down, as it were, to the imme-
diate present. I think it was old Fuller who remarked, that he who holds a
candle to lighten posterity, may bum his fingers withal —a fate which might
seem certainly to await one who has mingled not inactively in the disputes
of the day. But as to this I must take my chance ; being nevertheless of
opinion that the historian who becomes a partizan, to the extent that he
does so, discredits not only his judgment, but his accuracy. What facts are
necessary for the elucidation and completeness of Queensland history, will
be brought out with such clearness and vigor as I can exert ; what is unne-
cessary to that main purpose, and would gratify only more curiosity, or per


eonal spite, will be as vigorously suppressed. That some conclusions should
be deducted, some opinions expressed, is inevitable ; but I trust to escape
the censure passed by one of our most brilliant British critics upon a colonial
author—in his day eminent and useful nevertheless—that his history was
one of his own sayings and doings, with some references to the colony of
which he professed to write. In the first volume, the object is to preserve
what would be useful and interesting of what would otherwise be lost; in
the second, to present, in a connected and available form, information en-
abling the, reader, whether in the colony or in the mother country, to under-
stand how we arrived at our present position ; what that is ; and what our
possible future may be ; what is required to rectify the errors of our early
career, and to make even our failures contributory to our success. On the
accuracy of the statements made in both volumes, I challenge the criticisms
of my fellow colonists : as to the value of conclusions drawn from them, that
must be left to public opinion to decide.
It would be ungrateful in me to close these remarks without expressing
my thanks to the friends who have so kindly assisted me in the search after
information. To the late Sir M. C. O'Connell, the late Mr. Charles Cosen,
and the late Mr. G. H. Davenport, I was largely indebted. To. Mr. A. C.
Gregory, Mr. C. Barton, of Maryborough, Mr. Landsborough, Mr. George
Bourne, Mr. Wm. Thornton—l am under groat obligations ; and especially
to the Hon. James Swan for assistance which no other person in the colony
could have rendered. If I were to conclude by thanking Mr. Petrie, Mr.
Walter Hill (the late curator of our Botanical Gardens), Mr. Warner, senr.,
Mr. P. Phillips, and the proprietors of the Queensland Times for the aid
rendered me in the necessary researches into our earlier history, I trust I
shall not be thought ungrateful to many, who, from time to time, supplied a
fact or suggested a question which has been utilized, although, with a negli-
gence common to authors, the source has been forgotten. To the President
of the Legislative Council, and the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, my
thanks are due for the access afforded me to the Parliamentary Li In-ary ;
and to many of the Clergy—of whom particular mention will be found in
the proper place, I am indebted for facts which they only could have given
me the opportunity of tracing. The courtesy of the officia departments
whenever 1 have had occasion to refer to them, I gladly acknowledge. I
can affirm for myself, that I have spared no pains in the collection of in-
formation, and in testing the accuracy of that which was obtained ; and it
only remains for me to ask the indulgence of the reader for the faults he
may find in the use made of the material so kindly aliurded.

CHAPTER I.
1770—1824.
Connection, of past with present History—Original Cause of Settlement — Cook's Voyage to
Eastern Australia — Flinders’ first Voyage in 1799—His second Voyage and Examination
of Moreton Bay tn 1801 — King's Voyage in 1820 — Oxley's Search after a Site for a
Penal Establishment —His alleged Discovery of the Brisbane River in Moreton Bay in
1823 —Determination by the Government of New South Wales to form a Concict Settlement
in the Bay.
It is difficult to forecast the future of a colony which, possessing an area
of 009,520 square miles, and a coast line of 2,250, presents so great a
variety of climate, that in portions of its southern districts, it admits of
the successful growth of almost all the European vegetable products, and
in its central and northern territory, affords ns facilities for semi-tropical
and tropical cultivation of all kinds, while its geological formation is so
abundantly prolific, as to include within it almost every species of
valuable mineral—but which at the time I am writing, is estimated to
possess a population of little more than 213,000 souls. That with such a
population it raises an annual income of nearly, two millions sterling ;
that its exports (which now include antimony, coal, gold, silver, tin, rum,
sugar, tallow, timber, wool, and many minor, but rapidly developing
articles of native produce) amounted in value in 1880 to £3,448,1 (50, and
its imports to £3,087,296 ; that the average deposits in the ordinary banks
for that year amounted to £4,062,716 ; and in the savings bank, to
£747,089 ; that its sheep numbered 6,935,967, and its cattle, 3,162,572 ;
—these facts indicate a present which may be taken as foreshadow-
ing, under wise legislation and well-devoted energy, a brilliant future.
Kor am I inclined to look upon its public debt, incurred and authorized
of some fourteen and a quarter millions, as likely to depress the
energy of the people, or to interfere with the development of tire
colony, although its increase, unless under a widely different system from
the existing one, would be much to be deplored. We shall have to
count on 1.406 miles of railway in return for the nine millions of that
debt expended upon them ; and for the remainder, 5,768 miles of tele-
graph ; costly and necessary, though sometimes experimental, improve


ments in out harbors and rivers; many public works; and an immigration
expenditure of a million and a half : and although some portion of the
; loans have been applied to what public loans are too often required for—
meeting • the difference between current income and current outlay, the
amount is comparatively small. When I add, that the colony possesses
315 public schools, employing 989 teachers of various grades in the in-
struction of 43,305 pupils, besides 5 grammar schools, and 71 private
schools, it may be imagined that material requirements do not exclusively
occupy the public attention.
The reader, who turns to the thirteenth chapter of this volume, will
see what a comparatively humble place Queensland occupied on the
list of British colonies in 1859 to that which the figures I have quoted
show that she does now ; but even that humble position had not been
reached without much and persistent toil and effort, perhaps, considering
the small population and their scanty facilities, more of both than has been
shown in the noisier, and at times obtrusive, interval between the two
periods. It is about a hundred and eleven years since the occurrence of
the first incident which was in due time to be followed by the occupancy
of Morcton Bay. Fifty-four years after that, the first convict settlement
was planted at Brisbane. Eighteen years more elapsed before the district
was proclaimed a free settlement; and seventeen years of growth and
grumbling ended in 1859 by its creation into a colony. The history of
these periods, so far as it concerns Queensland, and the fluctuations of
condition, of effort, and of hope, which marked their later yeai-s, until
at length the colonists congratulated each other that they were free to
govern themselves, I have now to narrate.
Within a comparatively recent period, proofs have been brought for-
ward which would give to the Portugese navigators a priority of discovery
on the northern shores of Australia. But whatever might have been their
success—of which but faint records have been left—the Dutch are entitled
to the credit of being the first continuous explorers of the northern, west-
ern, and southern coasts of Australia. Their discoveries have been so
often and so completely described, that it would seem something like
book-making to repeat the description.* The right of Cook to be con-
sidered the first who made any definite investigation of the greater part
of the eastern coast, has been almost universally conceded, although oc-
casionally even his claims have been questioned. In a memoir on the
• See “ Lang's History of New South Wales,” vol. 1., chap. i. London, 1832 but
more especially a series of articles in the Brisbane weekly newspaper, the 1 Feat, for 1872
well worthy of republication in a separate form. ’


Chago Islands* by Mr. Dalrymple, a hydrographer of eminence at the
commencement of the present century, he adverts to a manuscript in his
possession, once belonging to Sir Joseph Banks, which, from internal evi-
dence, he considered to be not later than of the year 1575.
“ This very curious manuscript is painted on parchment with the
Dauphin’s Arms and contains much lost knowledge. Kerguelen’s Land
seems plainly denoted, and the east coast of Kew Holland—as in name
it is expressed—with some curious circumstances of correspondence to
Captain Cook's narrative. What he names Bay of Inlets, is in the manu-
script. called Bay Perdue ; Bay of Isles, R. de bcaucoup d’lles, and where
the Endraruvr struck, Coste Dangereusc ; so that we may say with
Solomon, ‘ there is nothing now under the sun.’ ”
It would not be just to Cook to hastily accept, in its entirety, the
conclusion here indicated. It is not impossible, however, that the
Dauphin’s map may have been shown by Banks, to whose exertions
the sending of Cook was mainly due, to that navigator, although
Hawkesworth’s ignorance of its existence may have prevented its ac-
knowledgement by him in his account of the voyage.—All that we know
of Cook’s character goes to negative the supposition that he would de-
liberately appropriate without acknowledgement the discoveries of a
predecessor.
It is not necessary for me to recapitulate the circumstances which led
to Cook’s voyage, for they are over and over again detailed in a variety of
publications readily accessible to the general reader. I therefore confine
myself to such a reference to Hawkesworth’s account of that expedition
as may connect its discoveries with the general narrative of the explora-
tion and settlement of the colony.
In May, 1770, Cook was on the east coast of Australia, sailing past
“ a bay or harbour in which there appeared to be good anchorage, and
which I called Port Jackson,” and on the 16th of that month, he was off
Point Danger, the commencement of our present southern boundary. On
the 17th, he was abreast Cape Moreton.
“ From Cape Moreton the land trends away further than can be
seen, for there is a small space where, at this time, no land is visible,
and some on board, having also observed that the sea looked paler
than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of Moreton Bay opened
into a river : we had then thirty-four fathoms of water, and a fine
sandy bottom ; this alone would have produced the changes that had
been observed in the colour of the water ; and it was by no means neces-
sary to suppose a river to account for the land at the bottom of the
bay not being visible, for supposing the land there to be as low as we

knew it to be in a hundred other parts of the coast, it would have been
impossible to see it from the station of the ship. However, if any future
navigator should be disposed to determine the question whether there is
or is not a river in this place, which the wind would not permit us to do,
the situation may always be found by three hills which lie to the north-
ward of it, in latitude of 26° 53'. These hills lie but a little way
inland, and not far from each other ; they are remarkable for the singu-
lar form of their elevation, which very much resembles a glasshouse,
and for which reason I called them the 1 Glass Houses the northernmost
of the throe is the highest and largest. There are also several other
peaked hills inland, to the northward of these, but they are not nearly
so remarkable.”
The mixture of accuracy and error in this extract is curious. Cook
was right in supposing that a river did not flow in the direction which
he named, and wrong in his conjecture as to the position of that which
actually did open into Moreton Bay. It is quite possible that his sug-
gestions may have influenced Flinders in his subsequent search, for his
name stood then as high in geographical investigation as Nelson's after-
wards did in war.
Leaving Moreton Bay, Cook ran along the north eastern coast of
Australia. Horvey’s Bay and Keppel Bay were successively discovered
and named. The little intermediate inlet of Bustard Bay was named in
honor of
“ a species of bustard, one of which was shot, as large as a turkey,
and weighing seventeen pounds and a half. We all agreed that this
was the best bird we had eaten since we had left England.”
Port Curtis he appears to have passed in the night. Broad Sound and
Cape Palmerston owe their names to him, as do also Halifax Bay and
Rockingham Bay, “ where there appears to be good shelter and good
anchorage, but I did not stay to examine it.” Without much more than
mere nautical examination he continued his voyage to the northern ex-
tremity of the coast, and left Booby Island on the 23rd of August, 1770,
having, in the name of the King of Great Britain, claimed possession of
“the entire eastern coast from latitude 38° to this place, latitude 10J° S.”
The territory thus taken he named New South Wales. The island
upon which the ceremony was performed he named Possession Island.
The eighth chapter of the third volume of Havvkesworth’s account is
occupied with
“ a particular description of the country, its products and people, a
specimen of the language, and some observations on the currents and
tides.”
The curious in such matters may find it interesting to compare
Cook’s observations with the recorded experience of travellers and


■explorers in our own day. His speculations upon the habits of the
aboriginal inhabitants and the natural character and produce of the
country, seem to me to have shared the natural fate which befalls almost
mil early theories —suporcession by conclusions that are derived from more
recent and more detailed investigation.
After the voyage of Captain Cook no thoroughly organised attempt
was made for nearly thirty years at further discovery on our coasts ; but
a combination of individual enterprise and public curiosity, led to an
effort, in 1801, to find some river which should afford access to the
interior of the vast island of Australia. Accordingly, on June 21, in that
year, the Lords of the Admiralty issued their official instructions to
■“ Matthew Flinders, Esq., commander of His Majesty’s sloop Investigator,
at Spithead,” to “ proceed in her to the coast of New Holland for the pur-
pose of making a complete examination and survey of the said coast, on
the eastern side of which His Majesty’s colony of New South Wales is
situated.”
The circumstances which led to this step are interesting, and their
record can scarcely fail to be instructive.
Shortly after the first settlement of criminals at Port Jackson, in
1788, Captain Hunter, who had accompanied Phillip, the first Governor of
Now South Wales, made a survey of Botany and Broken Bays and Port
Jackson, with most of the rivers falling into them. In 1795, Hunter re-
turned to New South Wales, as Governor. He brought with him two
vessels of war, the Reliance and the Supply, and arrived at Sydney in
December of that year. Flinders was then a midshipman, and Bass, a
navigator equally intrepid, was surgeon in the Reliance. The two joined
in various expeditions—sometimes in an open boat, sometimes in a vessel
hardly better, and together made their explorations along the coast. In
this way they discovered that Van Diemen’s Land, as it was then termed,
was an island ; and made the passage of the straits, between it and Aus-
tralia, named after Bass by Governor Hunter, at Flinders’ express desire.
Shortly after this, and upon Bass’s return to England, Flinders, on his own
proposition, was sent on the eastern coast in the Aurfolk, a colonial sloop,
of twenty-four tons. His principal object was
"to explore the Glass House and Horvey’s Bays, two large openings to
the northward, of which the entrances only were known. He had some
hope of finding some river discharging itself at one of these openings, and
of being able by its means to penetrate further into the interior of the
■country than had been before effected.”
It is this voyage that first connects Flinders with the history of
Queensland. We have two accounts of it written at different periods
by him, by collating which we are enabled to gain a tolerably clear lu-
ll*


sight into the facilities he obtained and the difficulties he encountered
On his return to Sydney he gave his journal to Governor King, and its
substance was published in 1802, by Collins, in his “Account of the Eng.
lish Colony in New South Wales, from its first settlement in January.
1788, to August, 1801.”
In Flinders’ own “Introduction” to the narrative of his second
voyage, he only briefly and technically refers to this one. I have there.-
fore adopted the journal as most useful to my purpose.
Flinders sailed from Sydney on July 8, 1799, and, on the 11th,
discovered, but cannot be said to have explored, Shoal Bay, inasmuch as-
he saw nothing of the Clarence River. On the evening of the 16th, he
dropped anchor in Moreton, which he terms Glass House, Bay—“ about
two miles from a low sandy shore on the west side.” The next day he
landed with a Port Jackson native named “ Bong-ree,” or, as we should
now spell it, “ Dungaree,” and endeavoured to enter into amicable com-
munication with some of the natives, who were watching their procedure ;
but, unfortunately, the overture on both sides ended in a skirmish, in
which one or two of the aborigines were wounded. From this circumstance
Flinders gave the place the name of Point Skirmish, it being in fact the
southernmost point of Bribie Island. Leaving that point, he moved up
the opening between Bribie Island and the mainland, which he mistook
for a river, and from the quantity of pumice stone found at high water,
called it the Pumice Stone River. The sloop, which had sprung a leak on
the 10th, was examined in the meantime, and a temporary stoppage hav-
ing been effected, he again made sail on the 17th, anchoring ofi a point
which, from the redness of its cliffs, he called Redcliff Point. He then
pulled over to a “ green headland about two miles to the westward,” but
found nothing noticeable save a native fishing net. Returning thence, he
continued endeavouring to get further up the bay, and landed on an
island thirty-four miles from Cape Moreton, in latitude 27° 33' 59" S.
This he found to be two or three miles in circumference, the central part
higher than the rest, and covered with a coat of fine vegetable mould of
a reddish colour.
“ The trees upon it, among which was the new pine, were large and
luxuriant ; beyond this island the bay was contracted into a river of
considerable width indeed, but it appeared to be so shoal, or, if there
was any deep channel, so difficult of access, that Mr. Flinders gave up all
idea of pursuing it further-respecially as the winds were obstinately ad-
verse.”
He, therefore, returned to Point Skirmish. It was probably the
'gland of St. Helena on which he landed.


On July 22, he got his sloop into the Pumice Stone. Here he had
her laid on shore and her cargo removed. By the 25th, he had stopped
the leak, reshipped the supplies, and made ready for sailing again. Out
of the six weeks allotted to him, one was entirely lost through the defects
of the Norfolk .
This necessary work being effected, he landed and started for the
Glass House Peaks, and, ascending one of the smaller ones, took a view of
the bay. He seems to have derived little benefit from his fatigues in the
way of discovery ; and he returned to the Norfolk on the 28th. He was
detained by bad weather two more days, and then sailed for Hervey’s
Bay,
“ Having passed fifteen days in Glass House Bay, Mr. Flinders was
enabled to form his judgment of it. It was so full of shoals that he could
not attempt to point out any passage that would lead a ship into it with-
out danger. The east side of the bay had not been sounded—if any ex-
isted, it would probably be found on that side.”
His visit to Hervey’s Bay at this time was so cursory, that it is
scarcely worth referring to ; and, after a hurried inspection, he sailed
for Sydney, where he arrived on August 20.
Fifteen years elapsed between this voyage and the publication of
Flinders’ narrative of his second exploration. It is a curious instance of
the fallibility of human observation and memory, however keen and
tried they may be, that we find this experienced navigator, when recalling
his impression of so many years back, in the epitome of his first voyage,
prefixed to his “ narrative ” thus concluding :
“I must acknowledge myself to have been disappointed in not being
able to penetrate into the interior of New South Wales by either of the
•openings examined in this expedition ; but, however mortifying the con-
viction might be, it was then an ascertained fact, that no river of import-
ance intei-seoted the east coast between the 24th and 39th degrees of
south latitude.”
The language of his journal, written on the spot, is much less posi-
tive, and in fact, leaves the question favorably open as regards the shores
of Moreton Bay. Some censure has been visited on Flinders for a pre-
sumed negligence in his search ; but in this it does not seem just to
concur. His sloop was leaky, and unfit for the dangers which so intri-
cate a navigation as that of the entrance to the Brisbane must have
involved. His crew was small —only eight men—his time limited to six
weeks, of which one was lost, in the necessary repairs to his crazy craft,
and the winds were adverse. Looking to his orders and his moans, ho had
not the time or the power for the exploration required. What is, how-
ever, to be regretted, is, that the habit of acquiescence in the directions


of his superiors, seems to have led him to consider them as comprehend-
ing all that it was desirable he should do. What means he had he used
well, but it did not follow that those means were adequate ; had they
been so, and had ho been less restricted, the “ ascertained fact ” might
have been the Elver Brisbane—not the absence of any river on a thousand'
miles of coast.
Shortly after Flinders returned to Sydney, the Reliance was ordered
home, and on her arrival in England, in 1800,
“ the charts of the new discoveries were published, and a plan was pro-
posed to the Eight Honorable Sir Joseph Banks, for completing the in-
vestigation of the coast of Terra Australis ; the plan was approved by
that distinguished patron of science and useful enterprise ; it was laid
before Earl Spencer, then First Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty,
and finally received the sanction of His Majesty, who was graciously
pleased to direct that the voyage should be undertaken ; and I had the
honor of being appointed to the command.”*
On June 21, as I have before said, the Admiralty instructions were
issued to Flinders. They were a strange jumble of inconsistencies.
He was to use his best endeavours to discover harbors, and in case he
found any “ creek or opening ” likely to lead to an inland sea, he was left
at liberty to examine it, or not, as he should judge expedient or as oppor-
tunity might serve. Much solicitude was expressed touching a plant
cabin for the purpose of sheltering boxes of earth in which were to be
placed “ during the survey, such plants, trees, shrubs, etc., as might be
thought suitable for the Royal Gardens at Kew.” An ancient sloop, the
Xenophon, crazy and unsound, became the Investigator for the purpose of
the voyage, and was, without doubt, deemed quite good enough for the-
employment to which it was devoted ; and the Lady Kelson tender, then
at Sydney, a vessel of similar character, was to bo placed under Flinders’
command. An astronomer, a naturalist, a natural history painter, a
landscape painter, a gardener, and a miner, were amongst the party who-
accompanied Flinders ; but, considering the official piety of those days, I
am somewhat surprised at not finding a chaplain. William Westall, an
artist of no moan note, was the landscape painter, and some of the. illus-
trations to the narrative do not detract from either his reputation, or that
of Woolnoth, the engraver. The whole number on board was eighty-eight*
Flinders, with a forethought, whoso motive must excite a smile at the
present day, took “ salt meat for eighteen months, knowing how little re-
liance could be placed ou the colony of New South Wales for that
article j” and, to guard against any contingencies, he left an application
to the Admiralty for a twelve month’s general supply, “ to be scut after
mo, and lodged in the store-houses at Port Jackson for our own use.”
* Introduction to narrative, p. 204.


On July 18, 1801, the Investigator sailed from Spithead, and on
December 7, was off Cape Leeuwin. Flinders then leisurely surveyed
the southern and eastern coasts—just missing the honor of being the
discoverer of Port Phillip—until he dropped anchor in Sydney Cove
on Sunday, May 9, 1802. Here he found the Lady Nelson waiting for
him. His preparations for the remainder of his voyage occupied some
time, and such amusement as was to be enjoyed he and his scientific
friends participated in. He records with decorous gravity, that on
June 4, being His Majesty's Birthday, Governor King gave “ a splendid
dinner to the colony, and the number of ladies, and civil, military, and
naval officers was not less than forty.” But he seems to have neglected
none of the more necessary details of his preliminary work. Some de-
ficiencies in his own crew were made up by probably “ old salts,” who
were promised conditional pardon should the report of their behaviour
bo favourable. The crew of the Lady Nelson was composed almost en-
tirely of prisoners. The re-victualling of his ship occasioned him some
perplexity.
“ The price of fresh meat at Port Jackson was so exorbitant, it
was impossible to think of purchasing it on the public account. I ob-
tained one quarter of beef for the ship’s company in exchange for salt
meat, and the Governor furnished us with some baskets of vegetables from
his garden. ... In purchasing a sea stock for the cabin, I paid £3
a-head for sheep, weighing from thirty to fifty pounds each when dressed.
Pigs were bought at 9d. per pound, weighed alive ; geese at 10s. each, and
fowls at 3s. : and Indian corn for the stock cost os. a bushel
From two American vessels which arrived, I purchased 1,483 gallons of
rum at (is. (id. per gallon, which, with what remained of our former stock;
was a proportion for twelve months.”
And thus provided and recruited, he set sail from Sydney for the
northern coast, on July 22, 1802, appointing Hervey’s Bay as a port of
rendezvous for the Lady Nelson.
Acting upon his impression that no rivers debouched into either Shoal
Bay or Moreton Bay, he sailed past those openings, and reached Hervey’s
Bay in nine days. Port Curtis was his first noticeable discovery, and
with some pains he explored the channel between that harbor and Keppel
Bay. Of the soil in the neighbourhood he gave a cautious approval.
Occasionally the explorers had communications with the natives, of whom
Flinders speaks in friendly and almost flattering terms. He spent a short
time at Port Bowen, of which Westall gives a spirited drawing ; but was
of opinion that not much could be said in praise of the country around
it. Shoal Water Bay met with little higher appreciation ; but Broad
Sound he examined with more care. He appears to have considered the
neighbourhood between the sound and the bay as worth attention


“There seems, indeed, to be a considerable extent of land al out Broad
Sound, and on the peninsula between it and Shoal Water Bay, which, if
not calculated to give a rich return to the cultivator in wheat, would sup-
port much cattle, and produce maize, sugar, and tobacco ; and cotton and
coffee would grow upon the more rocky sides of the hills—and, probably,
even on Long Island.”
He discusses, at some length, the best site for docks, the value of
the timber, and the probability of metallic production, with a terse
directness that contrasts favorably with the flowing platitudes of the bulk
of exploratory descriptions. Having finished his examination, he sailed
for Torres Straits —thus missing the Fitzroy and the fine country to the
north—in order to commence the survey of the now ■well-known Gulf of
Carpentaria. When he reached the Cumberland Isles, he was compelled
to send the Lady Kelson, back to Sydney.
“ Instead of saving the crew of the Investigator in case of accident,
which was one of the principal objects of her attendance, it was tco
probable we might be called upon to render that assistance.”
There is something odd in the comparison of craziness in these vessels
which such a remark suggests.
Sailing round Cape York, Flinders coasted down the Gulf, and on
November 22, anchored in the channel between Bentinck’s and Sweer's
Islands, which he named Investigator Roads. Here he had his ship
examined, when to his alarm and vexation, he found her rotten from
stem to stem. The master and the carpenter reported
“as their joint opinion, that in less than twelve months, there will
scarcely be a sound timber in her, but that if she remain in fine weather,
and happen no accident, she may run six months without much risk.”
It is impossible not to sympathise with the enthmiistic navigator in
his annoyance.
“I cannot,” he says, “express the surprise and sorrow which this
statement occasioned me. According to it, a return to Port Jackson
was almost immediately necessary, as well to secure the journals and
charts of the examinations already made as to preserve the lives ol
the ship’s company ; and my hopes of ascertaining completely the ex-
terior form of this immense and, in many points, interesting country, it
not destroyed, would at least be deferred to an unknown period.”
But reflection brought back that determination which formed so
prominent a feature in Flinders’ character. He resolved to finish, if
possible, his survey of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and “when the fair wind
should come to proceed by the west to Port Jackson, if the ship should
prove capable of a winter’s passage along the south coast; and if not.
to make for the nearest port in the East Indies.’’ He therefore coasted
past the Groote Eylandte and Cape Amheim, examining the bays as he


passed, and exploring and naming Arnheim Bay, of which he speaks
slightingly ; and then, driven by sickness and fear of his vessel, he sailed
for Timor on March 0, 1803, to recruit his health and refit, so tar as
refitment might avail. On the 10th of the following June lie arrived
in Port Jackson, when, on a survey of the Investigator she was pro-
nounced to be “ not worth repairing in any country, and impossible to be
made fit for sea.”
His first purpose was to renew his voyage, but unable to obtain a fit-
ting ship, he took passage for England. The vessel in which he sailed
was wrecked, and he escaped with some difficulty, reaching Sydney in
September. Here he obtained a small brig—the Cumberland —and pro-
ceeded on his homeward voyage through Torres Straits. He was com-
pelled to put into the Mauritius by the leaky condition of his ship, and
anchored on December 17, 1803, in Port Louis. There he found in
command one of the obnoxious products thrown up from the depths by
the French revolution —a man of coarse manners, narrow mind, and
ignorant assumption, named De Caen. He, at once availing himself of
the pretext that the pass given by the French Government was for the
Investigator, and not for the Cumberland, professed to doubt Flinders'
identity, treated him with groat harshness, and detained him as a prisoner
for nearly seven years, taking possession of the Cumberland, and appro-
priating his papers as well. It was not till towards the end of October,
1810, that Flinders reached home, having been released in the previous
June. Various circumstances so hindered him, that his narrative was not
published till May, 1814.
Here, so far as Queensland is concerned, the immediate interest of
that narrative terminates ; but his connection with the early surveys of
our colony, the accuracy of his charts, and the value of his investigations
as data for succeeding navigators and explorers on the coast of Australia,
secure for Flinders a very high place in the list of those from whose
labors we have benefited. His remarks upon the nature of the country,
and upon the natives with whom lie came in contact, are interesting in
themselves, but not sufficiently important to warrant quotation, especially
as his conjectures have long been superseded by the knowledge and ex-
perience of the explorers and settlers of our own day.
After the termination, in 1815, of the long war which followed the
French Revolution, the attention of the British Government was again
turned to the examination of the Australian coasts, and Lieutenant Phillip
Parker King was chosen for the work. He was directed to proceed to
Sydney, whore the then Governor, Major-General Macquarie, was to pro-
vide him with a vessel and crew ; and the well-known Allan Cunning-
ham, the botanist and explorer, was sent with him. The old notion of


discovering some river likely to lead to an interior navigation of Aus-
tralia, seems, from the instructions given to King, to have strongly
impressed itself on the Admiralty. King sailed from Sydney in the
Mermaid on December 22, 1817, to survey Bass’ Straits and the western
coast. Returning, he started for the eastern coast in May, 1820..
Kodd’s Bay seems the only special discovery made by him on this voyage.
On a third survey he simply amplified and corrected his preceding work*
finishing his cruise on April, 25, 1822. His painstaking diligence and
accuracy of observation, have secured him a high reputation among
our best hydrographers, and a considerable mass of valuable material was-
collected by him and Cunningham. One result of these voyages was the
attempt to form a British settlement at Port Essington on the northern
coast, which, after much outlay and trouble, was abandoned. Beyond
casual mention, its history scarcely deserves connection with that of
Queensland ; although of late years, and in connection with South
Australia, it has acquired some notoriety as Port Darwin.
After King’s voyage the desirability of further exploration on our
eastern and northern coast —except as it presented itself to a few enthusi-
astic geographers—seems to have faded away. What, however, tl e-
love of science or the demands of curiosity could not obtain, was at length
granted to the necessities of a penal settlement. Twenty-one years after
Flinders entered Port Curtis, the existing establishments under the Go-
vernment of New South Wales proving inadequate to the demands-
created by the increasing shipment of criminals from the home country,
his discoveries were turned to, in the hope of finding a suitable spot
towards the north for a new penal depfit. He had spoken not unfavour-
ably of the country in that neighbourhood, and after some consideration*
the then Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Lieutenant Oxley was
despatched in the old Mermaid, repaired and fitted for the purpose, in
quest of an available site. He left Sydney on October 28, 1823, and
anchored in Port Curtis on the sth of the following November. There lie-
occupied sixteen days in “a minute examination of the south-west coast
of this port, extending from the north head of Bustard Bay to Mount
Lawson.” South from Gatcorahe Head he “discovered a rapid mountain
stream, which received the name of the Boyne, and then examined the
country around but as the result of his minute researches, he came to
the opinion that Port Curtis afforded no site eligible for a settlement.*’
* The value of Oxley's opinion, on such points is questionable. On another occasion
he is found saying, “We had demonstrated beyond a doubt that no river could fall into*
the sea between Cape Otway and Spencer’s Gulf—at least none deriving its waters from
the eastern coast—and that the country south of the parallel of 34° and west of the-
meridian 147° 30' east was uninhabitable and useless for the purposes of civilised man


The country in the vicinity of Pvodd's Kay, he viewed with like disap-
proval, and disappointed and discontented, sailed for Morctou Bay, where
he anchored on November 25. Here an unexpected consolation awaited
aim.
“Early on the 2nd of December followin';," says his report, “when
examining Moreton Bay, we had the satisfaction to find the tide sweep-
ing us up a considerable inlet between the first mangrove island and
the mainland. The muddiness and the taste of the water, together with
the abundance of fresh water molluscic, assured us we were entering a
large river, and a few hours ended our anxiety on that point by 1 1 le water
becoming quite fresh, while no diminution had taken place in the size of
the river after passing what I called ‘ Sea Reach-’ ”
The river thus entered was the Brisbane.
But there was a good deal of disingenuousness, and almost dis-
honesty, in this report. The first fresh water mollusc® appear to me to
have been two poor fishermen named Pamphlet and Finnigan, who had
left Sydney with two others in the previous March, to fetch cedar from
the Five Islands, to the south of Port Jackson. A gale of wind drove
them out to sea ; and after suffering great hardships—one of the party
dying of thirst—the survivors were east upon Bribic Island. One of them
started to find his way to New South Wales, and was never more heard
of, and the two named were compelled to stay with the blacks. From
these men Oxley received intelligence of a large river falling into the
south end of the bay which they had crossed. He immediately acted
upon it, and taking Finnigan with him, met with the fresh water mol-
lusc®, and the usual phenomenon of fresh water, also in the Brisbane
itself, only twenty miles from its mouth.* It would not have detracted
from Mr. Oxley’s reputation had lie frankly admitted the value of the in-
formation gained from Pamphlet and Finnigan, and been content with
the merit of persevcringly following up their accidental discovery. His
report was silent upon that portion of the business ; and ho returned to
Sydney to receive the thanks of the Government, and the congratulations
of his friends. Whether the two poor fishermen ever even knew the value
of the service they had rendered, has not, that 1 can find, been recorded.
Oxley’s report —exaggerated and incorrect as it was—produced a
considerable sensation, not only in the colony, but on its publication at
home, in much wider and better informed circles. He told the world of
a noble river—not subject to floods, probably navigable for vessels of
The country thus coiideiunoii by wholesale, comprises one of the finest portions of the
present colony of Victoria, inclinling Gippslaml and its lakes.

burden fifty miles beyond the termination of his journey, and that ter-
mination seventy miles from Bribie Island. The width of the river at the
point where he commenced his return, he reported as half-a-milo, and its
depth at eight fathoms. Exaggerations like these render it difficult to
determine how far he really did ascend the Brisbane, or whether he
reached its first large tributary—the Bremer—as subsequently supposed
by Major Lockyer. The Brisbane is a noble and beautiful stream
without being able to lay claim to all the attributes with which Mr.
Oxley’s imagination invested it. His theory as to its source, being
based upon the assumption that it did not take its rise in mountainous
country, need not bo further alluded to.
But upon all these points, no contradiction could be, or at all events
was, at the time given to him: nor did it much matter to the then
Governor of New South Wales, whether the river was a mile or a quarter
of a mile wide sixty miles from its mouth. Sir Thomas Brisbane was
relieved from a difficulty by the discovery of a suitable locality for his
new penal settlement, and probably not displeased that the newly-dis-
covered river was named in his honor. So Moreton Bay was fixed upon
as a fit position for a fresh prison, and the process of civilisation, accord-
ing to the custom of those days, began. Fifty-five years had passed since
Cook first saw and named Cape Moreton; sixteen years of miserable
occupancy by a wretched population were to come.


CHAPTER II.
1824—1839.
General character of Penal Establishments—First Settlement of Convicts in 1824 — Logan's
Goverment-allan Cunningham's Discovery of the Darling Downs in 1827—Logan's
settlement of Ipswich — Cunningham’s Discovery of the Route from the Coast over the
Diriding Range to the Interior —Murder of Logan—Visit of the “friends” Backhouse
and Walker . in 1835 — Dr, Lang's Establishment of the Moravian Mission to the
Aborigines — Withdrawal of the Prisoners and preparation for a Free Settlement.
To a great extent, the history of one penal settlement is the history of all
penal settlements. The line of demarcation between keeper and criminal
was strong and distinct, and it became gradually a settled thing that,
whether a convict might or might not be occasionally right, the master
could never. be wrong. The result was natural. The consciousness of
impunity for tho governor, and of degradation in the governed, could not
but tend to lessen the care with which authority was exercised, and the
perception of just cause for its exertion. The beginning of wrong, as
much as of strife, is like the pouring forth of water ; and when the per-
sonal feeling which, in a small community, and more in such a com-
munity, must result from every punishment, whether inflicted justly or
unjustly, was onoo roused, every repetition of offence and its consequent
suffering, not only widened the distance between the judge and the
offender, but deadened the sense of justice and appreciation of guilt ;
and thus, by insensible degrees, a hardness of feeling has been found to
spring up in all these settlements, equally in the gaoler as in the
prisoners. They became “stern to inflict and stubborn to endure,” with-
out much reference to anything but facility of infliction and capacity of
endurance. The authorities drifted into cruelty, and the criminals
deepened in crime.
Looking at such influences as almost inseparable from the system
upon which the penal settlement of Moreton Bay was governed, I am not
so much inclined to consider the successive commandants as either
naturally or consciously the tyrants they have been described, and
possibly in some cases were ; or all the prisoners as the refuse of human


kind. What a different discipline might have resulted in, it is useless
now to speculate upon. The Christian virtues are not, I presume, sup-
posed to grow naturally in any purgatory, or the moral perceptions to be
■quickened by an enforced abstinenae from every ostensible kind of
mental occupation. That, from 1824 to 1889, Moreton Bay must have
been a place of torment to every conscientious man of right feeling in it,
can scarcely be doubted, when we consider the facts as to either Govern-
ment or conduct which have been allowed to escape from the dark
secrecy at first enforced to conceal still darker deeds, and since ac-
quiesced in from a sense of common disgrace.
It may be admitted, without offence to the feelings of those who
remain of the advocates or opponents of transportation during the long
struggle which preceded its abolition, that the general result of that
system was deteriorative of the moral sense of the colonies in much the
same manner as the existence of slavery, while oppressive and degrading
to the slave, was gradually lowering the moral perceptions of the slave-
bolder. In the newspapers of Moreton Bay, for instance, subsequent to
the cessation of transportation to New South Wales, I see more than one
record of meetings held in favor of the introduction of exiles, as it was
called, at which that introduction was enforced wholly from a presumed
necessity for cheap labor,* And I am quife sure that, whatever might
be the fashionable phraseology in the then colonial circles, where full
publicity obtained, the advocacy of transportation as a secondary punish-
ment arose more from a belief in its value as furnishing a supply of cheap
labor than from any other cause. A species, if not of contempt, at least
of disregard, for the feelings and rights of their servants, naturally arose
among those accustomed to the enforced labor of prisoners. On the
other hand, the servitude thus compelled was, in the great majority of in-
stances, a series of deceptions and shifts to avoid the labour imposed.
When a harsh employer resorted to extreme measures, so did his servants;
the one appealed to the'magistrates for vengeance, the other ran away.
This state of relation between employer and employed was a sad contrast
to the freedom of engagement and reciprocity of obligation which prevails
in a free community, and it is quite impossible that it could have existed
* I take from a report in the Moreton Boy Courier, of February 27,1847, the follow-
ing in illustration :—“lt was absolutely necessary that labourers should be introduced in hr
this district. It was only those who resided in the squatting districts who felt severely
the present deficiency of labor ; it was the great expense to which they were subjected in
procuring of that, had induced him, and others with whom lie was acting, to take
energetic measures for facilitating the introduction of labourers from North Australia or
from Van Dieman’s Land into this district.” —Speech at a meeting held at Ipswich, Feb-
ruary 22,1847. North Australia was the name proposed for an intended new penal settle-
ment.


so long without a mischievous influence on both classes. It is fortunate
that the absolute isolation of Moreton Bay during the penal portion of its
existence, and the cessation of the penal transportation system prior to its
being thrown open as a free settlement, greatly mitigated the effects of
that system to this colony.
But that isolation, while it lasted, led to great cruelty. I have heard
narratives of punishment so ingenious in their refinement of torture, that
I am almost disinclined to give credence to the facts they embodied ; and
yet, from the general concurrence of testimony, can hardly refuse assent.
And, moreover, statements of the kind involve the citation of authority—
a citation in most cases from the evidence of sufferers, and, therefore, in
these days, almost as grievous as the original infliction. It seems almost
indispensable to abstain from particular instances, although the general
conclusions I have derived are exceedingly unfavourable to the com-
mandants of the day. Only, therefore, when proved by independent
evidence of the neglect or cruelty of officials, will either bo alluded to.
As I have said, Oxley’s report of his discoveries met with high ad-
miration ; but whether from the superior weight attached to the authority
of Flinders, or from his own misgivings, the first settlement was ordered
to be not on the shores of the Brisbane, but on the laud named by
Flinders, Kcdcliff Point, The brig Amity was sent from Sydney in Sep-
tember, 1821, having on board Mr. Oxley and Lieutenant Millar, with a
detachment of the 10th, having in charge thirty prisoners, to make the ne-
cessary preparations. But the site being found objectionable, a party was
sent up the Brisbane to find a more eligible spot. They landed some-
where in what we now call Petrie’s Bight, and found what they were in
search of. The establishment was accordingly removed, and the first step
towards the foundation of the City of Brisbane was thus taken. Governor
Sir Thomas Brisbane shortly after visited the infant settlement and ap-
proved of the new site, ordering, however, that the buildings already
erected at Eedclilf Point —such as they were—should be left for the use
of the natives. The natives showed their matter-of-fact appreciation of
the legacy by naming the abandoned place “ Humpy Bong,” which may
be freely translated “ the dead houses and in process of time the “ dead
houses ” disappeared ; I believe but few traces of them remain.
For little more than a year the settlement went on in the usual slow
process of receiving additional drafts of convicts, and settling them to the
useless and monotonous employments of the day : but in 1825, Captain
Logan, of the 57th regiment, was sent to take charge. He seems to have
been a man of great energy and indomitable will, but, as is often the case
with men thus endowed, of irritable temperament, and when excited, of


ungovernable passion. During his government most of the old convict
buildings were erected. The prisoners’ barracks—the inscrutable looking
structure we call our observatory, then used as a windmill—a treadmill in
close proximity, an hospital, a receiving store, and four separate convict
stations, were all due to his energetic activity. He first discovered the
river named after him on the south-eastern side of the bay, on the banks
of which we have now a considerable and thriving population. I am
sorry to have to record, that on his return from this discovery, wearied
and hungry, some breach of discipline being reported to him, his success
inspired no feeling of lenity towards the unhappy prisoners. A few years
ago there was still in South Brisbane an old pine stump, the remnants of
a tree to which, on this occasion, all who were complained of were tied,
and suffered the unsparing infliction of the lash.
Logan's energy was not well seconded, nor indeed, was his own zeal
always according to knowledge./ Valueless land was cleared because the
overseers, being rewarded in proportion to quantity, chose the worst and
most lightly wooded, and sometimes useful timber was destroyed to
obtain worthless land, for, as in our pine forests, the two are often found
together. There are well-established anecdotes of one of his superinten-
dents sowing the dressed rice of commerce on Eagle Farm in. full expec-
tancy of a crop ; and of another, on being asked for a saw-set, referring
the applicant to the grindstone. With such assistants, it is not to be
wondered at, that jetties were built where they were unapproachable by
vessels, and vessels completed where it was impossible to launch them.
There was much in all this, in accordance with the practice of all penal
colonies, which seems to have been to find employment for the convicts ;
how, or upon what, being quite a secondary question.
In the first year of Logan’s commandantship, he was visited by
Major Lockyer, an officer of his own regiment. During his stay in the
settlement, Lockyer explored the Brisbane to its junction with one of its
principal tributaries, although which, seems uncertain. The creek now
named after him can scarcely have been the one, for he represents the
Brisbane and the Lockyer as navigable for a whale boat for one hundred
and thirty miles from the mouth of the former, the last fifty miles being
upon the Lockyer itself. Only in very rainy seasons would the Lockyer
be navigable one mile continuously, and, at those times, the strength of
the flood would be such as to render the passage of a boat up it altogether
impossible. It is not improbable that he rowed up the Bremer, and mis-
took it for the higher tributary. But accuracy was by no means a
necessary attribute of the narratives of some of the travellers of those
early days.


While Logan was alternately exploring and botanising, and flogging,
in the Moreton Bay district, Allan Cunningham penetrated the interior
from another direction, and discovered the Darling Downs. Previously
to the year 1827, the large tract of country “ lying on the western side of
the Great Dividing Range, between Hunter’s River, in latitude 32°, and
Moreton Bay, latitude 27° south,” was unknown. Oxley had, at one time,
contemplated an expedition in that direction, but sickness and infii-mity
had gained upon him apace, and prevented his active participation in the
work. The Government of New South Wales, seeing the possible ad-
vantages that might result, furnished an adequate equipment for five
months, and placed the expedition under the direction of Cunningham.
On April 20, 1827, he started from a station on the Upper Hunter.
New South Wales, thence skirting the Liverpool Plains, and crossing a
river which he at first thought the Peel Paver of Oxley, but subsequently
named the Gwydir, he continued in a northerly, and afterwards in a
north-easterly, direction through a country parched by drought, until he
reached a second river, which he named the Dumaresq. Thence being
driven by the sterility of the district in a more easterly direction, he
reached, on June 5, —
“ the confines of a superior country. It was exceedingly cheering to my
people, after they had traversed a waste, oftentimes of the most forbid-
dingly arid character, for a space more or less of eighty miles, and had
borne with no ordinary patience a degree of privation to which I had well
nigh sacrificed the weaker of my horses, to observe from a ridge which
lay on our course, that they were within a day’s march of open downs
of unknown extent, which stretched easterly to the base of a lofty range
of mountains, distant apparently about twenty-five miles. On the 6th
and following day, we travelled throughout the whole extent of these
plains to the foot of the mountains extending along their eastern side, and
the following is the substance of my observation on their extent, soil,
and capability.
“ These extensive tracts of clear pastoral country, which were subse-
quently named Darling Downs, in honor of His Excellency the Governor,
are situated on or about the mean parallel of 28° S., along which they
stretch east eighteen statute miles to the meridian of 152°, Deep ponds,
supported by streams from the high lands immediately to the eastward,
extend along their central lower flats, and these, when united in a wet
season, become an auxiliary to the Condamine river, a stream which
winds its course along the south-western margin. The downs, we
remarked, varied in breadth in different parts of their lengthened
surface; at their western extremity they appeared not to exceed a mile
and a half, while towards their eastern limits their width might be
estimated at three miles. The lower ground, thus permanently watered,
presents flats which furnish an almost inexhaustible range of cattle
pasture at all seasons of the year: the grasses and herbage generally
exhibiting, in the depth of winter, an extraordinary luxuriance of growth.
From these central grounds, rise downs of a rich black and dry soil, and

of very ample surface ; and as they furnish an abundance of grass, and
are conveniently watered, yet perfectly beyond the reach of those floods
which take place on the flats in a season of rains, they constitute a
valuable and sound sheep pasture. We soon reached the base of some
hills connected laterally with that stupendous chain of mountains, the
bold outline of which we had beheld with so much interest during the
three preceding days. These hills we found clothed from their foot up-
wards with an underwood of the densest description, in the midst of
which, and especially on the ridges, appeared a pine which I immediately
discovered to be the same species as that observed in 1842, on the Bris-
bane river. Encamping, I ascended a remarkable square-topped mount,
which formed the termination of one of these ridges, and from its summit
had a very extensive view of the country lying between north and south
towards the west. At N. and N.N.W., we observed a succession of
heavily timbered ridges extending laterally from the more elevated chaki
of mountains immediately to the east, which evidently forms the great
dividing range in this part of the country, whilst from the north-west to
west and thence to south, within a range of twenty miles, a most beauti-
fully diversified landscape, made up of hill and dale, woodland and plain,
appeared before us.
11 Large patches of land, perfectly clear of trees, lying to the north of
Darling Downs, were named Peel’s Plains, whilst others, bearing to the
south and south-east, and which presented an undulated surface, with a
few scattered trees, were named after the late Mr. Canning. Directing
our view beyond Peel’s Plains to the north-west, an expanse of flooded
country met the eye, evidently a continuation of those vast levels which
we had frequently observed in the progress of our journey, extending to
the westward of our line of route, and which, it was now perceived, were
continued northerly, at least to the parallel of 27°.
“ In a valley which led to the immediate base of the mountain bar-
rier, I fixed my northernmost encampment, determining, as 1 had not the
means of advancing further in consequence of the state of my provisions,
and the low condition of my horses, to employ a short period in a partial
examination of the principal range, to the western base of which we had
penetrated from the southward through a considerable portion of barren
interior. In exploring the mountains immediately above our tents, with
a view more especially of ascertaining how far a passage could be effected
over them to the shores of Moreton Bay, a remarkable excavated part of
the Main Range was discovered, which appeared likely to prove a very
practicable pass through these mountains to the eastward.*
I have been thus copious in extracting Cunningham’s description of
the Darling Downs, although it has been frequently quoted before, not
only because its unassuming accuracy contrasts so remarkably with the
inflated glorification of so many other explorers, but also because his dis-
covery exerted a far greater influence upon the progress of the colony

very properly named “ Cunningham’s Gap.”


than any made by his contemporaries, or almost by his successors. In
fact, I know of none in Australia that can be compared to it in that re-
spect, save, perhaps, the finding of gold upon the advance of Victoria. It
was really the opening of that vast expanse of territory which, running
northerly and to the west of the Dividing Range, now supports its sheep
in millions, and is yet in the infancy of development. I am not aware
whether the gentlemen whose stations spread over the Downs have paid
the fitting tribute to Cunningham’s memory of a memorial on the spot
where his northernmost camp was fixed ; but, if not, it is to be presumed
that want of the requisite information has alone prevented this being
•done. That such an obstacle shall exist no longer, I notice that the site
of that camp was determined by Cunningham to be latitude 28° 10* 45'
S, ; longitude 152° 7* 45' E. ; variation of the compass 8° 18* E.
On June 16, Cunningham put his people in motion on his return
"homeward. He attempted to shape a more easterly course than that he
had arrived by, but soon became involved in a mountainous and frightful
region from which he had some difficulty in extricating his party. At
length, attaining a lower level, he was enabled to pursue his journey, and
reached his point of departure, thirteen weeks after leaving it. On re-
porting his discoveries to the Government, they directed their attention
to a search for some communication between the new country and the
coast, and an expedition to test its practicability was resolved upon, the
conduct of which was again committed to Cunningham.
In the meantime Logan had not been idle. He traced the Bremer
River from its junction with the Brisbane to the site of the present town
of Ipswich, which, from the nature of the hills in its vicinity, he desig-
nated the Limestone Hills. To utilise the limestone was the next step,
and a kiln was built, and lime-burning commenced. These operations
were disturbed by the aborigines, to protect the burners from whom a few
soldiers were stationed at the place. Logan found the lime useful in his
building operations, and Cunningham narrates, that from 300 to 400
bushels were burned weekly at the station, and conveyed to Brisbane by
boats. Coal was also found, both above and below the homestead station,
and on the banks of creeks dipping to the Bremer, as well as in the bed
of the river itself.
In 1828, Cunningham left Port Jackson for Moretoa Bay, to ascer-
tain the possibility of connecting the coast with the interior. Immedi-
ately on his arrival, Logan and himself attempted to reach the Gap by
following up the course of the Logan River, and by Mount Lindsay. In
this they were foiled; but, after a short interval of rest, Cunningham
again started—this time alone —following up the line of the Bremer, and
c*


its main tributary, in a westerly direction. He left the settlement on
August 18, and in a week reached the Gap.
“The summit of the pass appeared before us, bounded on each aide
by moat stupendous heads, towering at least 2,000 feet above it. Here
the difficulties of the passage commenced. We had now penetrated to the
actual foot of the pass without the smallest difficulty ; it now remained to
ascend by a steep slope to the level of its entrance. This slope is occupied
by a very close wood in which red cedar, sassafras, palms, and other orna-
mental intertropical trees are frequent. Through this shaded wood we
penetrated, climbing up a steep bank of very rich loose earth in which
large fragments of a very compact rock (a whinstone) are bedded. At
length we gained the foot of a wall of bare rock which we found stretch-
ing from the southward into the pass. This face of naked rook we per-
ceived (by tracing its base northerly) gradually to fall to the common
level, so that, without the smallest difficulty, and to my utmost surprise,
we found ourselves on the highest part of the pass, having fully ascer-
tained the extent of the difficult part from the entrance into the wood to
this point not to exceed 400 yards. We now pushed our way through this
extraordinary defile, and in less than half a mile of level surface, clothed
with a thick brush of plants common to the Brisbane River, reached the
opposite side of the Main Range, when I observed the water fall westerly
to Miller’s Valley beneath us. Climbing the northern summit of Mount
Mitchell, which bounds the pass on the south, it was with no small
pleasure that I passed my eye over the beautiful tract of country at which
my labors of last year had closed.”*
Having thus established the practicability of communication from
the Downs to the sea-board, Cunningham returned to Sydney, and laid
the journal of his expedition before the Governor, Sir Ralph Darling. In
the following year he again made a voyage to Moreton Bay, botanical
research being the main object of his journey ; but he—
“ found a short period of his leisure to devote to geographical enquiry ;
and accordingly, in an excursion to the north-west, I explored that stream
(the Brisbane) far towards its source, through an irregular country, which
presented much diversity of surface to interest the geographer. During
that short journey, in which I employed a small party about six weeks, I
traced the principal branch of the river as far as latitude 26° 52', until
the channel assumed the character of a chain of very shallow stagnant
pools.' In this excursion I made such observations as fully established
two facts, viz.—That the Brisbane River, at one period supposedf to be
the outlet of the marshes of the Macquarie, Ac., originates on the eastern
side of the Dividing Range, its chief sources being in elevated lauds lying
almost on tire coast line between the parallels of 26° and 27° ; and that
the main ranges which separate the coast waters from those that flow in-
land continue to the north in one unbroken chain as far as the eye could

discern from a commanding station near ray most distant encampment up
the river, and present no opening or hollow part in their elevated ridge
through which to admit of a road being made to the interior beyond them.
My pass, therefore, through those lofty mountains—the mean elevation of
which above the shores of Moreton Bay, cannot be less than LOGO feet—
seems thus the only opening to the interior country, from the coast, be-
tween the parallels of 2t>° and 29° south.”*
In this last journey of Cunningham in the Moreton Bay district, he
had three collisions with the natives, seemingly without the slightest pro-
vocation on his side. His humanity was as conspicuous as his courage in
these encounters, which resulted in no great damage to the explorers or
their assailants. His opinion as to the impracticability of reaching the
Downs from the seaward, except by the “ Gap,” has been refuted by sub-
sequent experience, which will he narrated in its proper place. But I
am not surprised that he arrived at that erroneous conclusion, for. from
the peculiar overlapping of the spurs which project eastward from the
Main Range—in some cases for many miles—there is not, that I am
aware, a single break perceptible from the plains below, except the
“Gap” in the mountain wall, between the parallels he mentions.
When Cunningham had completed his task, in the’discovery of a line
of communication between Brisbane and the Downs, and thus increased
a hundredfold the value of that great pastoral interior, the zeal of the Go-
verment seems to have cooled, and nothing was done till long afterwards
to improve the natural facilities, or reduo* the natural difficulties of the
route. The principal object of the local authorities appears to have been
the perfect isolation of the settlement (approach to which, within fifty
miles, was strictly prohibited), and this so far as they could they vigor-
ously maintained. Captain Logan continued his botanioal and explora-
tory surveys, and his iron severity until October, 1830, when he was mur-
dered while absent on a short expedition. He had left his camp in the
morning, and, not returning, the men attached to his party, searching
without effect, returned and reported his loss. Captain Clunie, the next
in command, sent a party out, who, on the fifth day of their search, came
upon the dead body of Logan, pierced with a spear, and beaten with
waddles. Much indignation has been levelled at the “cruel and ferocious
blacks,” who were assumed to have been the murderers ; but there seems
reason to suppose that the contemporary rumours of participation in the
murder, by some of the white criminals, were not altogether unfounded.
So far as I have been able to ascertain, that impression still remains
among the few survivors of that period. Logan’s body was conveyed to
Sydney and received the honor of a public funeral.

After Lrgan’s death, Captain Clunie (of the 37th) succeeded to the
commandan'ship, which he held about four years, during which time the
course of events in the settlement proper, presented nothing but its or-
dinary monotonous round. On his removal in 1835, he was succeeded by
Captain Fyans (of the 4th), who remained only two years. Some of the
most interesting memoranda I have been able to collect touching the
penal period, I have derived from the journal of a visit to Moreton Bay
during his tenure of office, published in London in 1843. The writer,
James Backhouse, a benevolent Quaker, accompanied by his friend George
Washington Walker, who afterwards settled in Tasmania, left England in
1831, and spent nearly seven years in travelling through the known Aus-
tralian settlements of the day. Actuated, in the quaint language of the
recommendatory letters of the society, by an apprehension of religious
duty resting on their minds to visit in the love of the Gospel some of the
inhabitants of the British colonies of New Holland, Van Diemen s Land,
and South Africa, these benevolent minded men did not spare themselves
in the execution of their design. At some risk, and with some personal
fatigue they travelled during nearly seven years through New South
Wales and Tasmania, and visited Norfolk Island, and the result of their
impressions, while not wanting in shrewdness, is singularly free from acri-
monious or unnecessary censure. In the fourth year of their journeyings,
they obtained permission from Sir Richard Bourke, at the time Governor
of the colony, to visit Moreton Bay, where they arrived in 1836, and were
received by Captain Fyans with “all the attention and accommodation
our circumstances required.” Their attention was first directed to the
settlement, and I extract their description of Brisbane as it appeared to
them.
“ 3rd month , 29th day :—After making a hearty breakfast, we set out
to inspect the settlement of what is called Brisbane Town : it consists of
the houses of the Commandant and other officers, the barracks for the
military, and those for the male prisoners, a treadmill, stores, &c. It is
prettily situated on the north hank of the River Brisbane, which is navig-
able fifty miles further up for small sloops, and has some fine cleared and
cultivated land on the south side bank opposite the town. Adjacent to
the Government House, arc the Commandant’s garden, and twenty-two
acres of Government gardens for the growth of sweet potatoes, cabbages,
and other vegetables for the prisoners. Bananas, grapes, guavas, pine
apples, citrons, lemons, shaddocks, etc., thrive luxuriantly in the open
ground. The climate being nearly tropical, sugar canes are grown for
fencing, and there are a few thriving coffee plants, but not old enough to
bear fruit. The bamboo and Spanish reed have been introduced.
Coffee and sugar will probably at some time be cultivated as crops. The
surrounding country is undulating and covered with trees. To the west
there is a range of high woody hills distant, in a direct line, four miles. .
. . . The treadmill is generally worked by twenty-five prisoners at a


time, but when it is used as a special punishment, sixteen are kept upon
it fourteen hours, with only the interval of release afforded by four being
oif at a time in succession. They feel this extremely irksome at first,
but, notwithstanding the warmth of the climate, they become so far ac-
customed to the labour by long practice as to bear the treadmill with
comparatively little disgust, after working upon it for a considerable
number of days. Many of the prisoners were occupied in landing cargoes
•if maize nr Indian corn from a field down the river, and others in divest-
ing it of the husks. To our regret, we heard an officer swearing at the
nen, and using other improper and exasperating language. The practice
s forbidden by the Commandant; but it is not uncommon, and, in its
effects, is, perhaps, equally hardening to those who are guilty of it, and
hose who are under them. . . . We visited the prisoners’barracks—
a large stone building, calculated to accommodate 1,000 men, but now
"ccupied by 311. We also visited the penitentiary for female prisoners,
seventy-one of whom are here. Most of them, as well as of the men, have
neen re-transported for crimes that have been nurtured by strong drink.
The women were employed in washing, needlework, picking oakum, and
nursing. A few of them were very young. Many of them seemed far
rrom sensible of their miserable condition.”*
We read at this day, with some surprise, not unmixed with pity, that
at the Eagle Farm establishment there were forty females employed in
field labor. They were kept in close confinement during the night, and
strictly watched in the day time ; yet it was found very difficult to main-
tain order. Some wore chains to keep them from absconding. What the
life must have been that rendered association with the blacks of Moreton
Bay preferable to its endurance, must be left to those who choose to dwell
upon the subject to conceive. Any reformatory effect must have been
equally beyond expectation and possibility ; and to say the truth, there
seems to have been little effort in that direction. Backhouse nowhere
mentions an official religious instructor as resident on the settlement.
“ 4th month, Ist (Jay, being the day called 1 Good Friday,’ no work
was exacted from the prisoners, but they, with the military and civil
officers, whether Protestant or Eomau Catholic, assembled as on First
days in the chapel,f when the prayers and lessons of the Episcopal
Church, with a few omissions in deference to the Roman Catholics, were
read in a becoming manner by the superintendent of convicts.” And, “at
Eagle Farm, we again visited the female prisoners, for whom a selection
of tracts were left with their superintendent; they expressed thankfulness
for them, being very destitute of books—even of Bibles, which the pri-
soners generally have not access to even on First days.”
When leaving the settlement Messrs. Backhouse and Walker were de-
tained at the Pilot Station by contrary winds, and they landed at Amity

Point for change, as well as for the performance of their self-infosed
duties. This occurring in April, the weather was hot, and the travellers
gav| some handkerchiefs to the boat’s crew in acknowledgment of their
services.
“ Though prisoners, they may be allowed to wipe the perspiration
from their faces with them ; but so strict is the discipline, that they
would not be allowed to tie them round their necks Some of
the soldiers and prisoners applied for tracts, which they received grate-
fully along with a few books —including a Testament. They are very des-
titute of books, the only Bible I heard of at the station belonging to the
pilot.”*
Messrs. Backhouse and Walker left the shores of Moreton Bay on
April 17, 183 G ; after their departure, as far as I can find, the settlement
remained, with one exception, unvisited until the opening of the district
for immigration, save by prisoners and officials and small vessels bringing
the necessary supplies ; and, at a iater period, a favoured few who ob-
tained permission to reside for purposes of trade.
From the time of Messrs. Backhouse and Walker’s visit, the district
seems for a time to have slept the dead sleep of inane criminality. No
improvement was made in its material condition, and no labour was en-
tered upon tending towards it. At the time the convict establishment
was formally broken up, every record that might have thrown light upon
the procedure of the preceding sixteen years, was carefully removed, and
the miserable dilapidation of the buildings left, was the sole testimony
that remained of the indolent apathy with which the resources of a dying-
out system were employed in the latter days of its existence. I have seen
one book of memoranda, by which it would seem, from the kind and
quantity of tailoring and cobbling recorded, that the higher class of
officials were not unmindful of the value of an economically supplied
wardrobe. In fact, from all I can learn, the prisoners when not em-
ployed on such cultivation as was indispensable, were generally engaged
in the most useless possible avocations. As to moral improvement, we
may judge of the effort made towards it by the good Quakers’ narrative.
When, even the formality of an official religious instruction was omitted,

criminal bccime desperately wicked, the simple idiotic, and the active
mad. They who emerged from that slough fit for association with the

moderate q a itity of land was set aside for the purposes of the mission,
about seven n lies from the settlement, and there, under circumstances of
much I.a dsh p, and sometimes of absolute privation, the German mission
commenced Us work.
Du n■■ all this time the general tendency of circumstances was to-
wards the opening of the district as a free settlement. The rapid increase
in the flo ks and herds of the New South Wales squatters drove them to
enlarge their borders, and the discoveries of Cunningham were turned to
with longing eyes. The vigorous efforts made in England, as well as in
the colonies, for the abolition of transportation to New South Wales,
were fast reaching the wished for end, and it became evident that this re-
sult eing arrived at, the occupation of the Darling Downs, and their con-
nection with Moreton Bay, must necessarily compel the cessation of the
system there as much as at Port Jackson. To those, and they are not a
few, amongst us, who arc apt to depreciate the labours of science, I may
commend the fact, that to the exertions of a single explorer, is primarily
due li e contemporaneous deliverance of this district with that of the
parent colony, from the evils of the convict system. Had no overland
route been found by Cunningbam between the Upper Hunter River and
Moreton Bay, the isolation of the Brisbane district would have left it open

to the importation of criminals, just as Van Diemen’s Land was left, and
in all probability for as long a period.
Captain Fyans left in the year 1837, and was succeeded by Major
Cotton, who, during his two years’ stay, did, and left, nothing worthy of
record. After him a three months’ command was held by Lieutenant
Gravatt, and in 1839 the last commandant, Lieutenant Gorman (of the
80th), commenced the task of gradually clearing away the remnants of a
convict condition. The vessel which came for the remaining prisoners
brought the officials to whom were entrusted the task of regularly survey-
ing the country and laying out the future City of Brisbane. A good deal
had been done towards the exploration of the surrounding districts by the
late Mr. A. Petrie, who was sent in 1837 to take charge of the Govern-
ment buildings, and to whom this colony is indebted for valuable informa-
tion which, although not always well employed, tended to the promotion
of its ultimate settlement. And thus the ground was gradually clearing
for that opening of the district to a population which the first abolition of
transportation to New South Wales in 1840 necessitated. No criminals
were sent to Moreton Bay for penal punishment after 1839, and on May 5,
in that year, every convict, save such as wore thought indispensable for
the settlement, and to make up the surveyors’ parties, was withdrawn,
I am therefore inclined to consider 1839 as the real termination of the
penal era in this district, and the period between that year and the formal
proclamation of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842, as one of pre-
paration for the requirements which the new state of things would in-
volve. The grub had passed into the chrysalis condition. What the full
development would result in remained to be seen.

Wb now arrive at a period of the narrative whose interest, not, perhaps,
immediately apparent, grows upon ns as it proceeds. The process of free
settlement commenced under no small difficulties, arising partly from pre-
vious conditions of existence, partly from remoteness of position, and
partly from misconception of the probable future of the district —a mis-
conception which sometimes by the arts of speculators unduly antici pa ted
a rapid growth and early prosperity : but most persons understood More-
ton Bay as destined to remain, except as a profitable appanage to the
parent colony, a mere outpost of a not very refined civilisation. The
actual state of the place afforded little to contradict the more depreci-
ating supposition.
At the time when the convict rule was supposed to be nigh its end,
Brisbane existed almost only in name. There were no streets, and
nothing that could by any stretch of the imagination, be tortured into a
town. Fronting the river, adjoining what is now called William Street,
stood the modest wooden residence of the Commandant.* In its rear was
a long row of old rubble buildings for the minor officials and servants im-
mediately attached to him ; some of those rooms arc still remaining be-
* This, with much of the wood work of the old hospital, was prepared in Sydney, and
sent to Moreton Bay to be fixed, although timlxir admirably suited for the purpose was
growing all around. The only advantage resulting from tliis —if it could be so called —
was an entomological one. A peculiarly large and venomous spider, a native of Ceylon,
came in the timber, part of which was teak, and took up its quarters in the old hospital,
where the species long flourished, to the annoyance of the inmates.


hind an hotel in George Street, close to Telegraph Lane. At some dis-
tance further up the river, were the commissariat quarters, now the office
of the Colonial Secretary, and next to them the military barracks, at pre-
sent occupied by the Colonial Treasurer and a host of the Civil Service.
The hospital, transformed into a police barracks, has recently been re-
moved for our new Law Courts, The old prisoners’ barracks, which suc-
cessively accommodated our legislature, our law courts, and I know not
what besides, were as, until recently, we saw them—odd-looking and ugly.
The wind-mill usefully occupied the building now called the Observatory,
and on another aod slighter eminence, stood the female factory, until of
late the Police Court and Lock-up, now removed to make way for the
Telegraph Office. Farther on the road to Breakfast Creek—for Fortitude
Valley then had no name—was the house of the clerk of the works. Be-
yond these and a few temporary huts, there was nothing to indicate a
town ; and with the exception of the garden and cultivated ground men-
tioned in “ Backhouse’s Journal,” all was “ bush.”
Three surveyors, Messrs. Dixon, Stapylton, and Warner, were sent to
survey the country round the bay, prior to active measures being taken
for its settlement; but the course adopted under the direction of the Syd-
ney Government was marked by vacillation and inutility. The first at-
tempt made, in July, 1840, was to survey the coast, in order to connect
Moreton Bay with the Richmond Liver, a work whose immediate value it
is difficult to perceive. Messrs. Dickson and Warner were to commence
at the Bay, while Mr. Stapylton was to go overland, and run the Rich-
mond down to an agreed point of junction. It is exceedingly doubtful
whether at the time, Stapylton could have penetrated the frightful coun-
try into which this useless work would have led him ; ho and his party
were, however, unfortunately surprised by the blacks near Mount Lindsay,
and, with the exception of one man, cruelly murdered. The survivor had
been left apparently dead on the coals used to destroy the rest, on the re-
mains of which he was found, but was recovered by care and attention,
and, a few years since, I believe, was still living. This misfortune term-
inated the survey of the coast. The next proceeding was to measure off
a base line on ISlormanby Plains, a few miles west of Ipswich, for a trigo-
nometrical survey, which was persevered in for some time; and then a
similar work was commenced near Brisbane. Meanwhile, Mr. Dixon was
recalled, and a Mr. Wade sent in his stead ; the plans and records of the
work done being forwarded to New South Wales, and, so far as the dis-
trict of Moreton Bay was concerned, never more heard of. An expendi-
ture of time, skill, and money, so little calculated to advantage the settle-
ment, was thus fitly concluded.
During this time the prohibition of approach within fifty miles of


Brisbane remained in force, although occasional permissions were obtained
from the New South Wales Government for its suspension. The absence
of surveys for the town rendered it impossible for any intending trader to
secure a permanent site, and those who came, had to take their chance,
while, in fact, considerable hesitancy was shown in permitting free set-
tlers to come at all. A small schooner called the John, commenced trad-
ing between Sydney and Brisbane in 1810, bnt, when we know that it
was only of sixty tons burthen, we may imagine the limited extent of
the traffic.
While the course of change, slow but sure, was thus advancing in the
immediate district of Moreton Bay, the progress of pastoral settlement on
the Darling Downs was more rapid. The Messrs. Leslie, two enterprising
settlers of position and means, formed the station of Canning Downs, in
1840. Shortly afterwards, that of Kosenthal was settled upon for the Peel
Elver Company, and the sound of occupying footsteps fell continuously
upon the ear of the dismayed savage, until he had no longer a spot on "all
those fertile plains which he could look upon as his own.
It was impossible that this rapid work of settlement should be effected
without dispute and conflict with the native tribes. Bobbery and murder
by the blacks, and retaliatory indiscriminate slaughter by the whites, fol-
lowed in quick succession. Station after station was formed, and every
new occupancy drove the aborigines backwards, or might, perhaps, more
truly be said to have hastened their extermination. In the mass of con-
flicting statements, it is difficult to determine with whom actual hostilities
began ; but it seems consistent with probability that the natives of the
Darling Downs had long before been warned by the gossip of the tribes
of the unfriendly nature of the white’s occupation; and looking upon it
at the very commencement as an aggression, acted, according to their
light, in self-defence, when they killed his flocks and assailed himself.
When did civilization and barbarism come into contact without such a
result ? It is more easy to deplore the evils of the collision than to see
how they might have been prevented. That they were incalculably in-
creased by the unreasoning and wicked course pursued by some of the
settlers, it seems to me impossible to doubt.
Whatever may be thought of the conduct of the settlers towards the
blacks, there oaA be no question as to their energy in making the most of
the opportunities presented for their own immediate purposes. The facili-
ties of passage through Cunningham’s Gap were examined, when it was
found that the difficulties were far greater than his memoir left reason to
expect, although it is but right to say that the oldest surveyor we have in
this colony (Mr. Warner) has expressed strong doubts to me whether the
precise line of Cunningham’s real route has ever yet been found. But


however great the difficulty might be, yet, in the judgment of the pioneers
of settlement, it was thought better to encounter it than the dangers and
distance of an overland journey from Sydney. In 1810, the first drayg
passed through Cunningham’s Gap, and early in 1841, Mr. Patrick Leslie
made,the first family journey from Brisbane to the Darling Downs. By
this time the trade had so far increased, as to justify the occasional des-
patch of a steamer from Sydney by the then Hunter Piivcr Steam Naviga-
tion Company, and Mr. Leslie and his family came in the Shamrock.
When Mr. Leslie and his party arrived at Brisbane, his first care was
accommodation for the night, which, when hotels as yet wore not, was a
matter of some moment. The hospitality of the Commandant, due pro-
bably as well to the respectability of his visitors as to the claims of a
stranger, provided for them in various ways. My informant, with some
of his companions, found their quarters in the outbuildings of the modest
Residence, the blankets they carried with them forming couch and coverlet
on the hoarded floors. The following day they swam their stock across
the Brisbane, with the exception of one valuable horse which had been
purchased for stud purposes. There was no punt available for his passage,
and one had to be obtained from the station at Woogaroo. Once fairly
across the river, they went on to Limestone (now Ipswich), and found
quarters with one of the officials in charge, at a place half barn half bar-
racks, in which he was permitted to entertain the few who came his way.
In those primitive days the master -was almost invariably his own ostler,
happy if he was not as well his own cook and laundress ; and the young
traveller seeing a tall good humoured looking man busy in the primitive
stables, asked him who he might be. The answer was a little enigmatical,
and a good deal jocose ; and a sort of general conversation followed, in
which the past of the one, and the expectations of the other, were freely
communicated. A little surprise was felt by the new comer when enter-
ing the place appropriated for meals, he saw his recently gained friend
take the head of the table, and, in a strong Yorkshire accent, bid the tra-
vellers make themselves at home. The embarrassment did not, however,
affect his appetite or his rest. The next day the travellers continued
their route across Normanby Plains towards the almost unknown interior,
when they began their upward toil. The progress was naturally slow,
and camping out at night—no unpleasant experience in a climate like
that of Queensland when the weather is favourable—was the rule. On
one occasion the horse of which I have spoken, was left in charge of the
youth to whom he was accustomed, while the remainder of the party went
their different ways to provide the necessary contingencies to the night’s
rest. Wearied by his day’s toil, and lulled by the dreamy solitude by
which he was surrounded, he fell asleep. The pawing and snorting of


the beast awoke Mm to an unaccustomed sight—that of three tall sinewy
savages ; their heads wreathed with feathers, and their bodies striped with
the yellow earth in which they delighted—all armed with spears and
other weapons, strange enough in the eyes of him whom they had sur-
prised. He was unsuspicious of danger, and a parley, such as could be
maintained, began. They made him understand they wanted “bread,”
“bacca,” and “five allan.”* The two former he had not with him, the last
demand he did not understand. He was beginning to get a little embar-
rassed, when, to his great relief, Mr. Walter Leslie returned ; and, at sight
of an armed man, the blacks fled. The full extent of the youth’s daiiger
was then explained to him, and the whole party put upon their guard. As
night came on, one of their number, without experience in bush travel,
and seeing lights flickering in the thick scrub, became greatly alarmed,
fancying them the signals of an army of natives. One of more travel,
after enjoying the joke, dispelled his fears by quietly informing him that
what he saw was nothing more dreadful than the flashing of the fire-flies.
Still they were sufficiently prudent to keep strict watch till daylight came.
With the light came hunger, and darkness and fear departing to-
gether, one of the Messrs. Leslie took the youth with him in search of
game. They fell in with a bustard—similar, I suppose, to that which de-
lighted the hearts of Cook and his companions seventy-one years before—
which, having to carry for four miles, naturally still occurs to the bearer
as one of the largest, if not the largest, ho has ever met -with. The flavor
was equal in its way to its size ; and cheered and strengthened by the
meal and a subsequent rest, they commenced the main ascent. What
Cunningham thought easy, they, if they really hit upon his track, found
difficult; and not without much hard work —for the toil of twelve bul-
locks during fourteen hours, brought a light dray only six miles further on
the way—did they overcome the last “ pinch.” From that to Canning
Downs was easy travelling, and eight days after leaving Brisbane, they
found themselves settled to their respective avocations.
While the pastoral settlement of the western interior was thus pro-
gressing, and the Government of New South Wales becoming more alive
to the value of the district, the progress of discovery was not unimportant
in other directions. The discoveries and surveys of Flinders and King
had left many portions of our northern coast yet unknown. Those able
navigators, not less than their cotemporaries and many of their fol-
lowers, were firm in believing that the deep bays known to indent a large
portion of the north-western shores, received the waters of extensive
rivers, the discovery of which would not only open a route to the interior,
* “Five allan,” see note, Chapter ii., p. 2G.


but afford facilities for colonizing a part of Australia so near to India, as
to render its occupation a matter of evident importance. The English
Government determined therefore to despatch another expedition to sur-
vey and explore those parts of our shores which were wholly or in part
unknown to Flinders and King. For this purpose, early in July, 1837,
they despatched the Beagle, sloop of war, under the command of Captain
Wickham. Lieutenant Stokes, whose history I have before me, accom-
panying him in the first instance as first lieutenant and assistant surveyor.
The little importance attached to Moreton Bay at that time, is evidenced
by the circumstance, that I do not find any allusion to it as a settlement
throughout the narrative, although the Beagle's first visit to our shores
was in June, 1838, in which month she was off Breaksea Spit. There is,
indeed, little of Stokes’ narrative of special value in this history, until it
brings us to his discoveries in the Gulf of Carpentaria, where the Beagle
arrived in June, 18-tl ; the now rapid spread of settlement and flow of en.
terprise invest them with such interest as to justify somewhat extended
quotation.
After some casual surveying, the voyagers determined to ascertain if
the supply of water found by Flinders on Sweer’s Island continued avail-
able, and with that view they sailed for the island, where they arrived on
July 8, in the same year.
“ The Investigator’s old well was discovered half-a-mile eastward of
the point, on the SK. extreme of the island, to which I gave the name of
Point Inscription, from a very interesting discovery we made of the name
of Flinders’ ship cut in a tree near the well, and still perfectly legible,
although nearly forty years old. ... On the opposite side of the
trunk the Beaglels name and the date of our visit was cut. ... I
forthwith resolved that the first river we discovered in the Gulf should be
named the Flinders, as the tribute to his'memory which it was best be-
coming in his humble follower to bestow, ami that which would most suc-
cessfully serve the purpose of recording his services on this side of the con-
tinent.”*
I hope rather than expect, that those who may have followed Lieu-
tenant Stokes, have displayed equal good feeling, and spared the old tree
which records the visits of the Beagle and Investigator.
Stokes dug another well at what he thought a more convenient spot,
and, at the extreme of Point Inscription, found excellent water at a depth
of twenty-five feet,f “ pouring through a rock of concreted sand, pebbles,
and shells.” His observations at this portion of his narrative are well
worthy of extract.
* Stokes’ Discoveries in Australia, vol. it, p. 271.
t Ibid., pp. 271 and 274.


“ This was a very important discovery, as Investigator Road is the
only anchorage for vessels of all sizes at the head of the Gulf in either
monsoon, and possesses an equal supply of wood, fish, and birds. . . .
And lastly, I should observe, that in case of our being fortunate enough to
find rivers or fertile country on the southern shores of the Gulf, we at once
saw we might look forward to the time when Investigator Road (the road
fully deserves the name of a good port, being four miles in length by one
in breadth, with a depth of from four to six fathoms ; and sheltered at all
points, except from south to SSE., in which direction the shoalness of the
shore prevents any sea from getting up), should be the port from which
all the produce of the neighbouring parts of the continent must be
shipped.”*
A careful and accurate survey was therefore made, and the results
were in every respect satisfactory.
On the evening of July 28, the explorers discovered the mouth of the
first river they found in the Gulf, and which they named the Flinders ;
and on August 1, they entered another river, which we know as the
Albert. I regret that the demands on my space prevent my extraction
of the whole of the very vivid account which Stokes gives of the two dis-
coveries, but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of laying before my
readers a few especially eloquent and suggestive passages. The opening
of the Albert had seemed so favorable, that Stokes made up a party and
left the Beagle with the gig and the whale boat on the evening of the day
he returned from Flinders.
“ The prospects that lay before us raised our spirits to the highest, and
the weather clear, cool, and bracing, could not be more favourable, the
temperature being 60°. The ripples rolled rapidly, expanding from the
boat’s bows over the smooth glassy surface of the water, whilst the men.
stretched out as if unconscious of the exertion of pulling, every one of
them feeling his share of the excitement. From the western sky the
last lingering rays of the sun shot athwart the way, turning it, as it were,
by the alchemy of light into a flood of gold. Over head the cope of
heaven was gradually growing soberer in hue from the withdrawal of these
influences, which lately had warmed and brightened it; but in the west a
brilliant halo encircled the decling ruler of the day. The sunset as brief
as beautiful, night rapidly came on, and presently the masts of the ship
could no longer be seen, and we were pursuing our way in darkness to-
wards the mouth of the opening. After vainly endeavouring to get on
the bank extending 02 the mouth, in the dark, we anchored the boats out-
side. The awnings were spread, and the kettle for our evening’s meal was
soon hissing over a blazing fire. Of all things tea is the most refreshing
after a day’s fatigue ; there is nothing that so soon renovates the strength
and cheers the spirits, and on this occasion, especially, we experienced a
due portion of its invigorating effects. The grog was afterwards served
out, pipes and cigars were lighted, the jest was uttered, and the tale went

round ; some fished, though with little success, and the officers busied
themselves with preparations for the morrow’s work. But all things must
end ; the stories at length flagged ; the fishermen grew tired, and getting
into our blanket-bags, with a hearty good night -we resigned ourselves with
the exception of the look-out, to the arms of slumber The
general direction we pursued was still south, for six miles by the windings
of the stream, which was so reduced in breadth and volume, as to be
scarcely a hundred yards wide, and not a fathom deep. There was now
little hope that it would lead into fresh water, although, from the number
of trials that were made, I am sure there was salt water enough drank, to
have physicked a whole village. . . Nothing now- remained but to re-
trace our steps and try the other branch. ... At the end of three
miles in a W. by S. direction, nearly doubled by the windings, we passed
an island on the left, the depth at low w r ater so far being nearly two fath-
oms, and the width about 250 yards, promised well. Water-tasting had
now become nearly out of fashion ; however, it so happened, that one of
the whaler’s crew put his hand over and gave us the delightful news that
the stream was quite fresh 1 general tasting followed, each being
anxious to get the first draught of the water of our new found river ; and
the agreeable intelligence was confirmed. Of the importaifce of our dis-
covery, there could now no longer be any doubt, and the exhilarating
effect it produced on all was quite magical, every arm stretching out as if
the fatigue they had experienced had suddenly passed away
The country was gradually becoming perceptibly higher, and the scenery
extremely picturesque. Tall palm trees and bamboos were now to bo seen
among the rich foliage on the lower slope of the banks that rose here to
an elevation of fifty feet, and were much intersected with water courses.
Onwards we hurried, the influence of the tide being scarcely felt, and the
river preserving its SW-JS. direction, with a width of two hundred yards,
and a depth of two fathoms and a-half. At the end of three miles no
change was perceptible, and we began to congratulate ourselves on at last
having found a stream that would carry the boats far towards the point it
was always my ambition to reach—the centre of the continent.
It was in truth as glorious a prospect as could greet the eye. A magnifi-
cent sheet of water lay before us, one unbroken expanse, resembling a
smooth translucent lake. Its gentle repose harmonised exquisitely with
the slender motionless boughs of the drooping gums, palms, and acacias,
that clustered on the banks, and dipped their feathery foliage in the lim-
pid stream, that, like a polished mirror, bore within its bosom the image of
the graceful vegetation by which it was bordered. The report of our guns
as they dealt destruction among the quails that here abounded, rolled for
the first time along the waters of the Albert, breaking in on the hush of
stillness that appeared to reign over all like the presence of a spirit. The
country that stretched away from either bank was an extensive plain,
covered with long coarse grass, above which was occasionally seen tha
head of a kangaroo listening with his acute car for our approach. . . .
In our eagerness to proceed, we moved off rapidly up the river, after a
hasty meal. All beyond was mystery, and it seemed that we were destined
to remain in suspense : for the - day soon closed in, leaving only the pale
light of the moon to guide us. The depth continued regular at two and a-
half fathoms, and the width two hundred yards. We hastened on, the
night scenery being almost more beautiful than the day ; the heavens
seemed more deep, the water more glittering, the trees more graceful and


feathery, and here and there a tall palm raised its thin and spectral form
above the dense foliage through which the moonlight broke at intervals,
and fell, as it were, in showers of silver on the placid waters.”*
Seven miles of progress further, and they were obstructed by fallen
timber, they then returned and took another branch, where they were
again stopped by the same hindrance. Here they landed, it being now
clear that all hope of water carriage to the interior was at an end.
“ The boats w r ere at this time above fifty miles from the entrance, and
cur provisions only admitting of the remainder of the day being spent in
land exploration, a party was immediately selected for the purpose. Fol-
lowing up a short woody valley, and reaching the summit of the level, a
view* burst upon me. . . A vast boundless plain lay before us, here and
there dotted with woodland isles. . . The river could be traced to the
southward by a waving line of green trees ; the latter were larger at this
spot than in any other part, and consisted of tall palms, and three kinds
of gums. No trace of the western, branch could be discovered. . . The
line of verdure still pointed out the southerly course of the river across the
endless plains, and it became natural to speculate on its source or origin ;
whether it was the drainage of a swamp, or the outlet of some lagoon fed
by the Cordillera to the eastward. But to speculation alone was I reduced,
it not being permitted to me to clear the point: all I could do, was to give
cne lingering look to the southward before I returned. In that direction,
however, no curling smoke denoted the presence of the savage ; all was
lonely and still; and yet even in these deserted plains, equally wanting
in the redundance of animal as in the luxuriance of vegetable life, I could
discover the rudiments of future prosperity, and ample justification of the
name which I had bestowed upon them.f I gazed around despite my per-
sonal disappointment, with feelings of hopeful gratitude to Him w r ho had
spared not so fair a dwelling place for his creatures, and could not help
breathing a prayer, that ere long the now level horizon would be broken
by a succession of tapering spires rising from the many Christian hamlets
that must ultimately stud this country, and pointing through the calm
depths of the intensely blue and gloriously bright skies of Imperial Aus-
tralia, to a still calmer and brighter and more glorious region beyond, to
which all our sublimcst aspirations tend, and where all our holiest desires
may be satisfied.’’^
Stokes ascertained his position to be in latitude 17° 58£' S., longitude
7° 12 }/ E. of Port Essington, or 129° 25' E, of Greenwich ; and an ad-
mirable “ point of departure ” for exploratory expeditions to the interior.
Thus terminated his exploration of the southern shores of the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, nearly two hundred miles of which had been minutely examined

in the boats. Twenty-six inlets had been discovered, of which two proved
to be rivers, whilst three mors were nearly as promising.
After leaving the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Beagle proceeded on her
way, and after touching at various points, arrived at Rpithead on Sep-
tember 30, 1813, after an absence of more than six years. The additions
made by this voyage to the geographical knowledge of our coasts, were of
considerable importance, and the clear and sometimes eloquent language
in which the discoveries made are described, places Stokes’ narrative be-
yond the ordinary level of the “ travels ”of those days. More extraordin-
ary is the continuously generous feeling which I find in all these narra-
tives, from Flinders’ downwards. The respect paid by Flinders to Cook,
was reflected again upon him by King, and Stokes never fails to render
the fitting tribute to the labours of his illustrious predecessors. Not what
each might claim for himself, but what he might best learn was the right-
ful possession of those who went before him, seems to have been the prin-
ciple observed by all. They were all men who wrought for the work’s
sake, and while not unconscious of the value of personal reputation,
thought less of it than of the honest performance of duty by which it was
necessarily followed. I do not doubt that the perceptible existence of
this spirit amongst them has gone far to impart that authority to their
investigations and narratives which they have long and deservedly pos-
sessed.
The discoveries of Stokes on the north-western coast were unknown
to the little community struggling into existence on the shores of Moreton
Bay ; but the exertions of Cunningham were now to bear due fruit. The
growth of the settlements on the Darling Downs, and the gradual exten-
sion to the seaward, together with the favourable reports from the officials
of the locality, stimulated the New South Wales Government to a tardy
recognition of its value. In May, 1842, the whole district was proclaimed
open for free settlement. The proclamation was preceded by a visit from
the then Governor, Sir George Gipps, who came to look at the now district
himself, and to determine, from personal inspection, upon the plans pre-
paring fur the two towns of Brisbane and Ipswich—to which latter name
that of Limestone was to bo changed.
When the plans of the town of Brisbane were submitted to Sir
George Gipps, be evidently looked at them as for simply an ordinary pro-
vincial settlement. That it should at any time become the capital of the
district or its permanent port, seems never to have distinctly presented
itself to his mind —or, indeed, at that time, to the mind of any one. Four
or five years afterwards, Dr. Lang, in his “ Cooksland,” discussed the
claims to that distinction of Cleveland, between the of the Bris


■bane and the Logan, and Toorbal, in that passage between the main land
and Bribie Island, which Flinders had called the I’nmico Stone Kivcr —
giving the preference to the latter. Kven in 18C0 the idea of making
Cleveland the commercial port of the district had not been abandoned. I
am, therefore, prepared to believe, that at the time of Sir George Gipps’
visit, when, as yet, no town was, the attention of the few officials was
directed more to the extraction of revenue from the site they had than to
the investigation of its value as a port or capital. In fact, the natural
thought of any one who merely casually considered the subject then would
have been, that for a port, the settlement was too far up a river, supposed
to be encumbered by shoals and bars like the Brisbane ; and that where
almost everything was in the future, the final selection of the harbor
necessarily belonged to the future also.
The level ground available for the town was very small, and hence a
difference arose as to the width of the streets, and the size of the allot-
ments. Assuming that the population would always be inconsiderable,
Governor Gipps wished for the ordinary arrangement of an Australian vil-
lage—roads sixty-six feet wide, and allotments of a quarter of an acre
■each ; but, ultimately, after some opposition from the local surveyors, the
width of the princi pal street was increased to about eighty feet, and the
general town allotments were dim'nished in size to admit of the change.
A public quay was left on the north side, which, commencing where the
natural facilities admitted, near to the end of Queen Street, was to be
continued as time required—the necessary reserve being made—to Break-
fast Creek. The open space in the centre of the town, on which the
female factory stood, was loft as a sort of place or square, which, either
for health or effect, would have been of great value to its appearance.
The cupidity of some prominent residents subsequently teased the New
South Wales Government into the idea of abandoning the idea of the quay,
and selling its site. In revenge for an electoral defeat, the first Queens-
land Ministry deprived the town of its central square, and divided most
of the space into small and crowded allotments, to the permanent damage
and discomfort of the whole city. The principal initiators of these several
injuries still enjoy the reputation due to wisdom and disinterestedness,
while very generally Sir George Gipps bears the blame of proceedings
directly in the teeth of his own wishes and decisions.
The facility of water carriage from Limestone, as compared with the
then difficulties of land transit, joined to the existence of a convict settle-
ment there, led Sir George Gipps to examine the suitability of its position
for an inland town. Other sites were suggested—one where the Bremer
swells into a large kind of basin close to the present town, another at the
debouchure of that river in the Brisbane. The last suggestion was con


sidered inadvisable, for reasons which may have seemed good enough at
the time ; but, in the “ Minute of Instructions ” left by the Governor, the
site now occupied by the town of Ipswich was evidently considered as an
alternative one only.
“An accurate survey should first be made of all the country on the
right bank of the Bremer, for about a mile above, and two or three miles
below Mr. Thom’s house, and for about three miles along the high road in
each direction —that is to say, towards Brisbane on the one side, and to-
wards Darling Downs on the other. . . . The broken nature of the
ground is the only difficulty which opposes itself to the selection of the
site for the town. The plateau on which the shearing sheds stand, seems
to be the best, and this must be adopted, unless Mr. Wade should find one
lower down the river, to which a decided preference should be given.”*
Special directions are given in the same minute, that the main road
leading to Brisbane and to,the Darling Downs, should bo properly laid
out, and the errors in their then direction rectified. Unfortunately these
instructions met with the usual fate of even gubernatorial wishes when
the central authority is remote. The district surveyor did not look for a
site lower down the river, and did not lay out the roads ; but local per-
sonal interests and influences were allowed by him to supersede the essen-
tial considerations suggested by the Governor’s minute, and the present
inferior site for the town was retained. It has been the fashion to lay all
the blame of all the deficienoes in the plans of both Brisbane and Ipswich
upon the shoulders of Governor Gipps, but the most authentic information
I could obtain leads me to very different conclusions. A careful inquiry
into the facts would rather tend to the belief, that the stereotyped routine
of the New South Wales Survey Office in such matters, and the influences
to which its subordinates were subject, were too powerful even for a Go-
vernor ; a belief, strengthened by the fact, that in nineteen out of twenty
of the towns laid out since Gipps’ time—and even since Separation—the
very courses whose adoption led to the defects alleged to exist in Brisbane
and Ipswich, have been continued, and their evils multiplied and per-
petuated.
One procedure of Sir George Gipps at this time was certainly opposed
to every dictate of sound policy, and even of common gratitude. 1 have
before mentioned the establishment of the German mission to the abori-
gines within a few miles of Brisbane. It seems never to have been
popular with the class who most easily found access to the higher official
circles, or with the bulk of the debased population of Moreton Bay ; and
hostile suggestions were not wanting. And, moreover, the Governor
* I am indebted to Mr. Warner for the use of his official copy of this minute, as well 1
as for much general information.


looked upon the very moderate quantity of land allotted for its use with
the eye rather of a rapacious landlord than of a philanthropist or states-
man. It came within the boundary of what he thought might, at some
time, be deemed suburban lands. So, without giving direct orders for the
removal of the mission, he suggested to its head a journey to the interior,
ostensibly for the discovery of a more useful, but really of a less perma-
nent, and apparently less valuable location. It might have occurred to
Irim, that even were the missionaries unsuccessful in their efforts to Christ-
ianise tiro aborigines, their services could have been well retained for the
imported population ; and that something was due to the self-denial which
marked the attempt, even though the results had fallen below anticipation.
I am the more surprised at this conduct, because a belief in the possibility
of colonizing the aborigines now caused an eifort towards that end in a very
opposite quarter to that whence the first proceeded. Dr. Folding, the late
Homan Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, endeavoured, in 1812, to establish
a mission for the purpose at Dunwich, once a convict station, on Strad-
broke Island. Ido not, however, find that any beneficial results followed
from it,, and it was subsc mitly abandoned. And, to close the subject
here, I may as well mention that the small external support which had been
at first given by tire New South Wales Government, having been about this
time withdrawn from the Moravians, one of the clerical heads left the sta-
tion sometime in 1813, and his colleague followed him a year afterwards.
The lay missionaries, however, retained their position, and, being assisted
by throe new ones sent in 1844, made such effort as was practicable,
either in their original enterprise or in visiting their white neighbours.
In time a prosperous little settlement arose, known as the German
Station, and some of our most useful colonists have descended from those
pioneers of civilization. In the failure of both Roman Catholics and Mo-
ravians to carry out their original purpose, there is nothing to be sur-
prised at. The enormous chasm between the complexity of faculty and
the amount of knowledge of a savage of so low a type as the Australian
aborigine, and those of his would-be civilizers, which has to be bridged be-
fore either can arrive at even a remote idea of the other’s meaning in such
matters as faith and worship, presents difficulties which, the more they are
apprehended, the more insurmountable they become.
Shortly after Sir George Gipps’ return to New South Wales, the map
of Brisbane was sent to the Central Survey Office, and the sale of the first
sections advertised at Sydney for December 7, 1842. The plans exhibited
have been described to me by a looker-on as scarcely surpassed by those
gorgeous and imaginative documents, which, in the wild days of the Vic-
torian diggings, flaunted in the windows and doorways of speculative and
alluring Melbourne auctioneers. There was a good deal of curiosity


about the district, and, as is usual in the Australian colonies—and to
an outside observer unaccountably so—when land in a new settlement,
which not a single buyer has ever seen or known anything of, save in 3
meagre official account or a Government map, is offered for sale, there
was a vigorous competition. Some years since I was much amused with i
lively description by one of the ablest public men in Australia,* who was
residing in Sydney at the time of the sale, of the imaginative values
affixed by grave lawyers and money-wise merchants to the new town al-
lotments of Moreton Bay ; and of the zeal with which they bid against
each other for land whose title deeds they, in time, and with equal judg-
ment, treated almost as waste paper. One allotment has been pointed out
to me, for which more money was paid iu 1812 than it would have
realized ten years ago. Some of us have witnessed more extravagant in-
stances in our own time, for we have known a town allotment in one of
our extreme northern possessions purchased at a Government laud sale for
nearly £lOO, and, three years afterwards, sold for £2. Nor iu this case
had either of the purchasers seen, or had even a chance of seeing, what he
had bought, although it may be presumed that the last price was probably
far nigher the real value of the allotment than the first. Such was the in-
fluence on speculative investment of the puffery of Government des-
patches, in giving fictitious importance, nearly twenty years ago, to a
solitary island, which may become a settlement some time during the
next generation.
While Sir George Gipps was thus unconsciously laying the founda-
tions of a capital, the wisdom of the English Parliament—or rather that
portion of it which took any interest in colonial affairs—was engaged on
an experiment in government for the colony of which Moreton Bay then
formed a very unimportant portion. For some years before, there had
been more or less of agitation in New South Wales iu favour of represen-
tative institutions, and the subject having been repeatedly brought before
the home Government, Lord John Russell, iu 1841, prepared a draft of an
Act for its settlement. A change of ministry took place, and it then fell
to the lot of Lord Stanley (the late Earl of Derby) in the session ol
1842, to lay a bill for the purpose before the Parliament. There were
some differences between that bill and the measure of Lord John Russell,
which Lord Stanley stated he had been induced to make by the represen-
tations of Sir George Gipps and some other influential persons connected
with the colony. The main provisions of the Act, as finally passed, prove
the hesitancy with which the privileges it did confer, were granted, as if.
while embodying a principle, its application was falteringly and feebly

made. By this instrument of government, a Legislative Council was
created, consisting of fifty-four members, thirty-six of whom were elect-
ive, and eighteen nominees of the Crown. Five of the eighteen were the
Colonial Treasurer, the Auditor-General, the Attorney-General, the Col-
lector of Customs, and the Commander of the Forces. The elective quali-
fication was fixed at the possession of a freehold of the value of £2OO, or
occupancy at a rate of not less than £2O per annum, while the representa-
tive one was constituted by the ownership of freeholds worth at least
£2,000, or an income of £IOO per annum derivable from property. The
duration of the Council was to be five years ; all money bills were to
originate with the Governor, and a civil list of £BI,OOO per annum, as
well as the regulation of the Crown lands, was reserved from Legislative
control. One remarkable provision was, that in the event of a new
colony being formed to the northward of Sydney, no territory lower than
26° S. should be detached from New South Wales. The Act arrived in
Sydney on January 1, 1813, and no time was lost in bringing it into
active operation.
There was a large party who viewed the measure with little favour.
The power of the purse remained with the Governor and his advisers, and
responsibility in any shape seemed a mere assumption. The reservation of
the Crown lands from the control of the Council met with special disappro-
bation ; and the Act, which was intended as a peace offering by the Im-
perial authorities, became rather a text for the harangues of a very clever
and not very scrupulous opposition. But, looking at the peculiar social
condition of New South Wales at that time, it seems quite possible that,
had Lord Stanley’s Act been more liberal, it might have been productive
of a very great deal of mischief. It was an experiment, and as an experi-
ment, was necessarily limited and tentative. In the elections which fol-
lowed its promulgation, Moreton Bay, joined to the electoral districts of
the Macquarie and the Upper Hunter, had a very insignificant influence
on the return of the successful candidate —Mr. Alexander Macleay—many
years Speaker of the old nominee Council, which, nominally as legislators,
but really as a consultative body, assisted the Governors of New South
Wales in their gubernatorial functions.
The people of Moreton Bay left the dissensions and controversies of
Sydney, on these points, to take care of themselves. What was of far
more immediate interest to them, was the quick following of the initia-
tory land sales at Sydney by others at Brisbane, the first being held there
on August 9, 1843, and the second, for the sale of allotments at Ipswich,
on October 11, in the same year. These sales were on the auction system,
and conducted on the same plan as the primary sales under our present
Crown Lands Alienation Acts. The districts were divided into town,


suburban, and country allotments, the minimum price of the two former
varying at the discretion of the Government, and of the latter being £1
per acre, to which, to the great discontent of the colonists, it had only re-
cently been raised by the home authorities from twelve shillings. But
prior to this, the attention excited by the proclamation of the district as
free, and the Governor’s visit, had led to a great increase in the progress
of squatting settlement, and both sides of the Brisbane and its tributaries
were rapidly occupied ; the usual skirmishes between the pioneers and the
natives accompanying the occupancy of every fresh station.
Government here, during this time, was gradually drifting into the
ordinary quietude of a district administration. In March, 1812, the last
of ' the penal Commandants Lieutenant Gorman had resigned his
authority into the hands of the late Dr. Simpson, who had been previously
sent as Crown Land Commissioner for the district, and in November of
that year, Captain J. C. Wickham was appointed Police Magistrate.
They had very little difficulty in the performance of their respective
duties, for the population was small—properly impressed with the pro-
priety of submission to those in authority over them, and disposed to take
things easily. Their chief disquietude arose from the continuous conflicts
between the squatters and the blacks, which, before the close of the year
1813, began to assume rather formidable proportions. In the districts
bordering on the Wide Bay, in the neighbourhood of the Brisbane, and all
along the passages over the Dividing Range, the attacks on the settlers
were determined and vigorous. A carrier named Phipps discovered a
practicable pass from the northern portion of the Darling Downs by way
of the township of Drayton, then and long afterwards known as “The
Springs.” As this route reached the foot of the mountains, after it
crossed the Upper Lockyer, it ran along a gorge, gradually narrowing,
nowhere of great width, intersected by wide and very deep gullies imper-
ceptible at a small distance, and bounded on both sides by an impene-
trable scrub. A station was formed near it, called Helidon. In this
small flat, a party, escorting a number of drays with stores, were suddenly
attacked by a considerable number of blacks, with such ferocious vigour,
that the escort lost heart and fled, and the drays and their contents be-
came the spoil of the savages. In revenge of this, a large party of squat-
ters and their dependents made a general raid upon the blacks, a number
of whom were driven into the singular isolated table mountain, named by
Cunningham, Hay’s Peak. Towards the summit this consists mainly of
large basaltic boulders, and I was told by a friend, who was present at
the fray, that when the natives were forced back to its ascent, they rolled
the boulders down the precipitous slopes with great effect, and to the dis-
comforture of their assailants. No small number of the sewages were,


however, shot at the time. Their hostility was not decreased, nor theii
readiness to show it, at length a small party of soldiers was perma-
nently quartered at the entrance of the gorge I have described—thence
named Soldiers’ Flat. This step I presume to have been effectual, as Ido
not read of any general or preconcerted attack afterwards upon the sol-
diers, or upon parties travelling in that direction. In the year 1861 I
was camped close to the spot, and the half-ruined hut and remains of the
soldiers’ little garden—then occasionally occupied by a care-taker from
the neighbouring station—looked sad and solitary beneath the shadows of
the mountains and the gloom of the surrounding forest. Now a township
has been settled at a short distance from it, and the whistle of the loco-
motive and the rush of the railway trains mingle with the more pleasing
notes of the ancient inhabitants of the woods.
But, prior to this ceaseless and indiscriminate hostility, one of those
almost incredible crimes which disgrace our efforts at colonization, is said
to have occurred at Kilcoy—a station on the north of the Brisbane—and
to have had a marked effect in stimulating the revengeful passions of the
aborigines, already sufficiently provoked by the outrages to which, in this
as well as in adjoining districts, they had been exposed almost ever since
penal settlements began. I allude to the poisoning of a considerable
number of blacks by the admixture of arsenic with food given them for
the purpose—a crime so atrocious in every aspect as to appear almost in-
credible. I am afraid that, to the disgrace of humanity, the accusation
was in tliis, as in not a few other cases, too true.
In the few historical or semi-historical works relative to the colony
that I have seen, the subject has been vigorously dealt with. Dr. Lang,
in his “ Cooksland,” and subsequently in his “ Queensland,” accepts the
murder as a fact, and discusses it with his customary indiscriminate vehe-
mence. Mr. Clement Hodgkinson, at one time connected with the Sur-
vey Office of New South IVales, in a small work of his on the Macleay
River and the northern settlements of New South Wales, treated the
charge as one of “ridiculous improbability.” Mr. Pugh, in his slight hut
valuable condensation, pretixed to his Almanac for 1861), does not refer to
it. But, as bearing on an important question connected with that policy
of precipitating settlement at all hazards which has formed the subject of
so much administrative panegyric here, the whole matter is one of too
great importance to be passed lightly by.
Nearly contemporaneously with the date of the alleged poisoning at
Kilcoy in 1812, a similar instance, but on a larger scale,* occurred in the

Clarence River district. The circumstances provoked such comment, that
the presumed principal delinquent was, as I am informed by a member of
our Legislature long resident here, with whom I have conversed on the
subject, apprehended and sent to Sydney, where, after some detention, he
was discharged from the want of available legal evidence against him.
Now, in 1839, and not with reference to that case, “An Act to allow
the aboriginal natives of Kern Smith Wales to be received as competent
ivitnesses in criminal cases,"* was passed by the then Council during
the government of Sir George Gipps.f This Act was disallowed by the
Home Government ; but surely no greater proof of the admitted preva-
lence of outrages upon the aborigines can be furnished than the enact-
ment of such a statute. The provision of a remedy proves the existence
of an evil. Again, in the evidence of an old settler and magistrate of the
territory, when examined before a Select Committee of our Legislative
Assembly, on the Native Police Force in 1861, I find a curious confirma-
tion of the practice. In reply to the question ;
“ You have stated, that it is through fear that many of the cruelties
are perpetrated upon the blacks, which appears to me rather inconsistent
—will you explain your meaning more clearly ?”
He answers;—
“ I have known in former times on the Maointyre, where two or three
men might be living at a station together, who would employ the blacks,
and give them rations and tobacco—well these men would be frightened
out of their lives by the blacks, and not being strong enough to go out
and fight them, and being always in a state of fear, they would pop a
gun through the slabs of the hut and fire upon them, and perhaps kill a
blackfellow ; at other times they would put poison in a damper and
give it to the blacks. It was never the case when the stations were
strongly manned, and therefore, as I said before, fear of the blacks was
the chief cause of these murders.”J
And many hundreds of miles from Morcton Bay, Mr. Robinson, the
protector of aborigines for the district of Port Phillip, officially declared
in 1815, that there was “ reason to fear that the aborigines have been
poisoned, and the ends of justice defeated for want of legal evidence.” I
might easily multiply proof on this head by the testimony of settlers of
long standing and unexceptional character, but I prefer citation of no-
torious facts, and from offloiai documents, and to extend this further
would be a waste of time. What has been given at least disposes of the
“ ridiculous improbability ” of the charge.
• New South Wales Statutes, 3 Vic., No. IG.
f In 1850, again the Attorney-ffoncral of that colony, in a debate upon a bill for
legalizing aboriginal evidence, treated the fact of the poisoning as indisputable.
t Votes ami Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, 1861, p. 481.


We now come to the facts peculiar to the case itself. When the Eev.
Mr. Schmidt —at the time head of the German mission to the aborigines—
in compliance with the wishes of Sir George Gipps, set out to visit the
Bnnya Bunya country to see how far the removal of the mission was prac-
ticable, he was accompanied by some natives of the tribe resident in the
mission locality who acted as guides. Upon reaching a portion of the
country inhabited by another tribe, he found his companions unwilling to
proceed further, and, upon enquiry, they alleged as a reason, that a con-
siderable number of the natives, through whose district they were going,
had been poisoned at a station settled amongst them, and that, in re-
venge, the life of strangers, either white or black, coming in that direc-
tion, would be unsafe. Ultimately, the good offices of some of the ag-
grieved tribe were obtained, and- the journey was prosecuted in safety.
But in the official report of Mr. Schmidt to Dr. Lang—who was then sec-
retary to the mission—the fact was alluded to, although in such a very
quiet and off-hand manner, as to create an impression in the mind of the
reader, that the circumstances were not so uncommon as to require de-
tailed comment.
“ There was also another reason which influenced greatly our natives
against going any further—viz., a large number of natives (about fifty or
sixty) having been poisoned at one of the squatter’s stations. The neigh-
bouring tribes are going, we are told, to attack and kill the whites when-
ever they meet with any.”
Dr. Lang moreover states —and he has not been contradicted —that the
same report had not only been brought to the mission by lay brethren who
had received it from another and distinct tribe, but that Mr. Schmidt
had himself heard it talked of by the residents in Brisbane. In conse-
quence of the publication of Mr. Schmidt’s report, and the comments it
occasioned, Mr. Schmidt was officially interrogated on the subject, and
reiterated his former statement. Ko further enquiry was entered into—■
it may be from the Government finding no legal evidence available ; but
an unexpected confirmation of Mr. Schmidt's truthfulness was afterwards
afforded from widely different quarters. The late Mr. Andrew Petrie
made, in 1842, an expedition to Wide Bay, in the course of which he
rescued two runaway convicts, named Davis or Davies, and Braceficld,
from the aborigines, with whom they had associated for some years.
Their designations in the tribe were Darumboy and Wandio. Both these
men and their black companions dissuaded Mr. Petrie from any attempt
at interior exploration, urging that—
“ the blacks wore determined to attack ns, as they would have revenge for
the poisoning of their friends at some of the stations to the south.”


The Wide Bay blacks at the same time told Wandie “ that the white-
fellows had poisoned a number of their tribe.” Mr. Petrie’s truthfulness
has never been impugned, and inasmuch as his narrative has stood thus
for more than thirty-seven years, it is impossible not to regard its concur-
rence with that of Mr. Schmidt as of great weight in establishing the fact
that the poisoning did occur.
This concurrent testimony was unexpectedly, but most emphatically,
supported in 1861, by the evidence taken before the Select Committee of
the Legislative Assembly, to which I have before referred. One of the
witnesses examined, who had been on the Kilooy station at the time of
the alleged poisoning, after informing the committee that the blacks had
been troublesome, two of his hands having been killed during his stay, al-
though neither he nor the owner, Sir Evan Mackenzie, came personally
into collision with them, gave the following replies to the questions
quoted :
“ During your residence there, were any of the blacks poisoned, or re-
ported to be poisoned I —l heard something of that, but not until after we
left. I first heard of it from Mr. Mcrcwether. I travelled with him in
the same steamer with Sir George Gipps. Mr. Merewether began talking
with me about the blacks, and gave me all the particulars. I had not the
slightest idea before, that such a thing had occurred at all, tut it must
have happened whilst I was there.
“ Do you remember hearing of anything of the sort while you were at
the station ? —I remember the overseer saying to me one day, ‘ Don’t you
think it would be a good thing to give those fellows a dose V Of course I
expressed my abhorrence of the suggestion, and no more was said about
it. I never heard anything further on the subject.”*
The enquiry of the overseer appears to me of great significance. It
pointed not to an experiment, but a method —something alreadj r tried and
found sufficient for the purpose, and intended to be repeated as occasion
might seem to require. Taking the whole of the eviden*e in conjunction
with the narratives of Schmidt and Petrie, it would bo difficult, in the ab.-
seucc of stronger proof to the contrary, to doubt the truth of the charge
brought.
Mr. Hodgkinson, indeed, suggests, that—
“ according to the account of the squatters, it would appear that some
sheep, diseased and scabby, had been dressed, as usual, with arsenic,
which, with corrosive sublimate, is the ordinary remedy for scab. These
sheep had been rushed by the blacks, and a number of them carried off,
and it is supposed that the arsenic caused the death of some of the
thieves.”
* Votes and Proceedings of the Assembly, 1801, p. 477. Evidence of John Ker
Wilson. Esq.


K ilcoy station was not even formed at the time, and squatters do not
usually want to take up new country with diseased and scabby sheep.
The evidence from which I have quoted refers to no such circumstance.
And the savages were always keen enough to distinguish between injuries
caused by what they had stolen, and those resulting from what had been
given them. The form of death w r as entirely new to them. Had they
“ rushed ” the sheep—stolen them with violence—in the teeth of the shop-
herd’s resistance —and some then died from eating them, the survivors
would hardly have confounded such a consequence with death following
from a gift, which was the essence of their statement. The intercourse of
the particular tribe with white men was of very recent date —limited to a
few occasions during a month or two, and the very fact, that they did so
discover the mode of destruction may be taken to afford strong internal
evidence of the fact.
I am by no means inclined to concur in Dr. Lang’s sweeping and in-
discriminate censure of the squatters as a class. I do not suppose that
Sir Evan Mackenzie was at the time personally cognizant of the atrocity
of his men, or that he would not always have forbidden its practice. But
what every right-minded man must regret, is the determined opposition to
any real enquiry by which every charge of the kind was met—the pallia-
tions offered on behalf of the accused, and the half-defiant and slighting
manner with which the accusations were put by. From this sort of pro-
cedure the actual murderers derived encouragement. They concluded,
that while their employers prohibited the crime, they had little anxiety to
secure its detection, and less scruple in profiting by its commission. Had
the squatters of Moreton Bay in 1842 been wise in their generation, they
would have insisted on an investigation, which would have rendered im-
possible the suspicions which were not infrequently and ungenerously di-
rected against them from hostile quarters. It might have been trouble-
some ; but the convenient is one thing, the prudent and far-seeing
another.
Long after this poisoning, rumours periodically arose of similar occur-
rences in the district, but apparently without tangible foundation. As
time passed, and population increased, a better and more powerful public
opinion arose, and he would bo, indeed, a bold man who ventured now on
any such crime; although, until within the last few years, the slaughter of
a native was too often looked upon, and is sometimes now—and by men
who have been taught and ought to have known better —as of little more
moment than that of his dog. The mischievous result of that crime was
long apparent. The tribes did not lack means of rapid and correct com-
munication. Their dialects may differ, as the dialect of uneducated


Yorkshire differs from that of uneducated Kent, but there is always suf-
ficient homogeneity in the language of contiguous districts, to enable their
inhabitants to understand each other ;* and from all that I have learned
I can arrive at no other conclusion than that very many of the murders
perpetrated by the blacks for years afterwards were more or less in conse-
quence, or in revenge, of the wholesale poisoning at Kilcoy.
* Thus, m 1841, Mr. Leslie’s party, travelling to settle on Canning Downs, were asked
by the blacks of Cunningham’s Gap for “ Five Allen,” — I>., Five Islands, the name given
to biscuits by the Bribie Island aborigines after Pamphlet and Finaigan’s stay with them
in 1823—eighteen years before.


CHAPTER IV.
1843—1846
Passage of the Preferable Liens Act — Invention of the Boiling Down Process—Agitation for
Exploring Journey to Port Essington—Refusal by Governor Gipps—Leichhardt Volun-
teers—Starts on his Journey in 1844—Arrives at Port Essington, 1845—Return to Sydney
and Presentation of Testimonial-Establishment of " Brisbane Courier”—Census of the
Settlement —First Customs Officer Appointed—First Local Steamer.
I gladly turn from the enquiry in the preceding chapter—one, however,
which could not have been omitted in any full and honest history of the
colony—to matters of less gloomy aspect. After Sir George Gipps re-
turned to Sydney, ho soon found himself involved in disputes on a variety
of subjects with his new Council, while the asperity of opposition was not
softened hy the monetary depression under which the colony of New
South Wales then laboured.* One result of that time of trial, was the en-
actment of the “ Preferable Liens Act, 7 Victoria, No. 3, of New South
Wales," since modified in various ways, but still, in its main principle, the
law in all the colonics. Its object was to facilitate the giving security
upon stock and wool without actual delivery to the lender. As a measure
of relief, its beneficial elleot was soon felt, and its operation has been, on
the whole, of great advantage to the squatting community, and the mone-
tary establishments immediately connected with their interests. Another,
and still more beneficial consequence, was the introduction of the “ boil-
ing down ” process, by which unsaleable sheep and cattle were converted
into saleable tallow, and a staple article of export at once created. In
the advantages of both these improvements, the settlers of Moretou Bay
necessarily participated ; the political disputes concerned them little, and
they cared for them in proportion.
In the midst of political strife and monetary struggle, the desire for
geographical discovery increased in vigour. The nature of the vast in-
terior of this island-continent to the west and north of New South Wales,
remained a problem which geographers were intent upon solving. Nor

were there wanting men of considerable weight in New South Wales, who
fully concurred in the opinions which had been repeatedly expressed in
England, relative to the important benefits to the colonies, as well as to
the empire, which a near connection between Australia and India would
confer. The attempted settlement at Port Essington originated in such a
conviction by the Imperial Government, which indeed, has seldom been
wanting in colonial support from those who desired to improve their
means or their position by a convenient acquiescence. It is pleasing to
trace the first practical efforts towards penetrating Australia with the
purpose of testing the practicability of the connection 1 have referred to,
to a combination of parties in New South Wales, which, from the usually
antagonistic nature of its elements, may reasonably be supposed to have
been genuine. On October 3, 1818, and on the motion of Dr. (now Sir
Charles) Nicholson, the following votes were carried in the Legislative
Council: —
“ That, whereas, the establishment of an overland route between the
settled parts of New South Wales and Port Essington. will bo attended
with important additions to our geographical knowledge of the interior
of Australia, and is an object the accomplishment of which is likely to be
attended with great advantages to the commercial and other interests of
this colony, by opening a direct'line of communication with the islands of
the Eastern Archipelago, with India and other parts of Asia: Resolved,
That a committee be appointed for the purpose of enquiring into the prac-
ticability of such a design, and the means whereby it may be carried into
effect, and that they do report to the Council the result of such inquiry
with as little delay as possible.”
“ Question put and passed, and committee, consisting of the follow-
ing members, appointed : —Mr. Khvin, Dr. Lang, Mr. Suttor, Mr. Went-
worth, Mr. Macarthur, and Dr. Nicholson.”
As is usual before all Parliamentary committees, a good deal of evi-
dence not directly bearing upon the question, although probably of value
in other respects, was taken, but ultimately there seemed to be no reason
to doubt the desirability of some such expedition as that suggested, al-
though opinions were divided as to the exact route to be adopted. Sir
Thomas Mitchell, the then Surveyor-General, whose previous success in
exploration in the western and southern districts of the colony imparted
considerable weight to his opinion—was decisive in his recommendation
of Fort Bourke on the Darling River as a starting point. The only alter-
native suggested—that of Moreton Bay as a point of departure—the com-
mittee rejected, because of the “formidable difficulties” likely to attend
such a commencement,
“The Dividing Range,” the committee observed, “would have to be
surmounted, occasioning to the cattle and horses at starting a degree of


fatigue and exhaustion, which would probably much impair their strength
and usefulness in the subsequent part of the journey ”
an opinion which now can only occasion a smile. They recommended
the route by Fort Bourke, and an expenditure of £I,OOO by the Colonial
Government in support of the undertaking. Sir George Gipps, with a
hesitancy scarcely consistent with “Imperial interests,” although concur-
ring in the desirability of the attempt, referred the recommendation for
the approval of the Secretary for the Colonies, alleging the “present cir-
cumstances ” of the colony as justifying his doubts.
Dr. Lang describes the general feeling at this unexpected result as
■one of great disappointment, for which, however, a solace was not long in
presenting itself. Dr. Ludwig Leichhardt—a name mournfully associated
with much of disinterested enterprise, and of that kind of patient endur-
ance under suffering which calls for qualities far beyond ordinary hero-
ism—was then in .Sydney awaiting the result of the committee’s recom-
mendation. He was desirous of attaching himself to the proposed expedi-
tion as a naturalist, and, finding himself deprived of that opportunity, lie
conceived the idea of leading one himself. He had previously spent some
time in the district of Moretou Bay, to which he had travelled overland,
and had been gratified and surprised by the novelties of its physical cha-
racteristics. His personal means were small; but this was more than
compensated by an enthusiasm and a perseverance sometimes scarcely
compatible with prudence. He proposed to start from Moreton Bay with
a small party, and thence to push for the Gulf of Carpentaria, intending
then to follow the coast to Port Essington. However great may have
been the sorrows of the New South Wales public that the £I,OOO was not
forthcoming for Sir Thomas Mitchell’s journey, they showed in the ex-
pression of a very limited sympathy, the extent of their assistance to
Leichhardt. The help he received was paltry ; and never having been
connected with official circles, or with an influential clique of any kind,
he seems to have been generally regarded as a singularly bold intruder on
a work cqnHlv beyond his province and his powers.
LeichiffirUt had been educated as a physician, but, with a not unusual
■divergence of pursuit, extended his studies to other and kindred branches
of physical science, somewhat to the neglect of his original profession.
He was a good naturalist and botanist, of temperate habits and well fitted
to bear fatigue. A passion for exploration was combined in him with an
intense and jealous avarice of fame to be derived from the accomplish-
ment of supposed impossibilities. To state a difficulty or to suggest an
obstruction was simply to stimulate him to effort. Writing to Professor
Owen (from whom he had received a letter of introduction to Sir Thomas
Mitchell), in 1811, he says :
E*


“ Living here, as the bird lives, who flies from tree to tree, living on
the kindness of a friend fond of my science, or on the hospitality of the
settler and the squatter, with a little mare I travelled more than 2,500
miles zigzag from Newcastle to Wide Bay, being often groom and cook,
washerwoman, geologist, and botanist at the same time ; and I am de-
lighted in this life, but I feel too deeply that ampler means would enable
me to do more and do it better. When you next hear of me, it will be
either that I am lost and dead, or that I have succeeded to penetrate
through the interior to Port Esslngtoa.”
I know nothing that could give a more graphic idea of the spirit that
animated this, in many respects, extraordinary man.
With a slender equipment, which he somewhat hurriedly completed,
Leichhardt left Sydney in August, 1844. Tie was accompanied by two
young Englishmen, named Calvert and Boper, John Murphy (a lad six-
teen years old), Phillips (a convict), and an aboriginal called Harry
Brown. A rather protracted voyage in the old Sovereign steamer, im-
poverished his horses, and he was glad to rest on his arrival in Brisbane,
where he was hospitably received by Sir Evan Mackenzie, the late Mr.
Pemberton Hodgson, and others, who felt an interest in his intended jour-
ney. During the short delay thus occasioned, he sought opportunities of
profiting by the greater knowledge possessed by his friends of the country
through which the proposed commencement of his travel would lead. His-
first idea seems to have been to keep to the eastern slopes of the Dividing
Range, as near to the coast as was compatible with heading the rivers
taking their sources on that side. The result of many friendly discussions
was that, with some reluctance, he abandoned that intention, and crossed
the Range to Westbrook, and thus, while keeping to its west, but in a
nearly parallel line to the coast, escaped a very difficult and dangerous
country, which might have then presented obstacles insurmountable even
to him. Some alterations, dictated by the experience of the settlers, were
made in his equipment while resting at Westbrook, and the number of the
party was increased by the addition of Mr. Pemberton Hodgson, Mr.
Gilbert (a naturalist, who had been with Gould, the great ornithologist),
a negro, and another aboriginal, named Charley. Bullocks were substi-
tuted for pack horses for carrying the stores.
“ Neither my companions nor myself knew much about bullocks, and
it was a long time before we were reconciled to the dangerous vicinity of
their horns. By means, however, of iron nose-rings, with ropes attached,
we obtained a tolerable command over their movements, and at last, by
dint of habit, became familiar with, and even got attached to, our blunt
and often refractory cowpaynl de voyage .*
* “ Leichhardt's Journallntroduction, p. 13. London, 1847,


“ By a present from Messrs. Campbell and Stephens of four young-
steers and one old bullock, and of a fat bullock from Mr. Isaacs, our stock
of cattle consisted now of sixteen head. Of horses we had seventeen, and
our party consisted of ten individuals. Of provisions we had 1.200 lbs. of
'flour, 200 lbs. of sugar, 80 lbs. of tea, 20 lbs. of gelatine, and other articles
of less consideration, but adding much to our comfort during the first few
weeks of our journey. Of ammunition we had about HO lbs. of powder
and eight bags of shot of different sizes, chiefly of No. 4 and No. G.
Every one. at ray desire, had provided himself with two pairs of strong
trousers, three strong shirts, and two pail’s of shoes, and I may farther re-
mark, that some of us were provided with ponchos, made of light, strong
calico, saturated with oil. which proved very useful to us by keeping out
the wet, and made us independent of the weather, so that we were well
provided for seven months, which I was sanguine enough to think would
be sufficient time for our journey. The result proved that our calculations
as to the provisions were nearly correct ; for even our flour, much of
which was destroyed by accident, lasted to the end of May—the eighth
month of our journey—but, as to the time it occupied, we were very
much deceived.”
By the end of September, 1844, the preparations of the party were
completed, and on October 1, they left Jimbour, the then farthest occu-
pied station, and “ launched, buoyant with hope, into the wilderness of
Australia.”!
Leichhardt himself divided his route into eight sections, justifying
the division by the varying character of the country through which lie
travelled. The first was from the Darling Downs to the Peak Range, in-
cluding the Dawson and Mackenzie Rivers (latitude 27° to 23°); the
second, the plains of the Peak Range, including the rivers Isaacs and
Suttor (between 23° and 23° 50'); the third, the Lower Sutter, the Bur-
dekin. and its table Land (21° to 18°); the fourth, the Lynd, the Mitchell
and the east coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria (between 18° and 1G°); the
fifth, the Plains of Promise, of Captain Stokes, at the head of the Gulf,
with the Flinders, Albert, and Nicholson Rivers (in latitude 18°): the
sixth, the west coast of the Gulf (between 18° and 15°); the seventh, the
River Roper and Avnheim's Land (between 15° and 13° 50'); and the
eighth, the Alligator River and Coburg Peninsula (13° 40" to 11° 21').
Adopting his own division, wc shall be able to connect the narrative of his
travels with the more condensed and systematic description given in the
lectures which, after his return, he delivered at the School of Arts in
Sydney, in August and September, 1846.
Starting from Jimbour on October 1, Leichhardt reached the Conda-
mine River in six days, and, after following it a short time, left it trend-

in" to the west.* On the 11th, in forcing their way through a scrub, the
bullocks upset their loads, and tearing the bags, lost about 143 lbs. of
flour. Still keeping in a north-westerly direction, he reached the Dawson
on November 5 ; but two days before he had reduced the number of his
party.
“ It had now become painfully evident to me, that I had been too
sanguine in my calculations as to our finding sufficiency of game to furn-
ish my party with animal food ; and the want of it was impairing our
strength.* We had also been compelled to use our flour to a greater ex-
tent than I wished ; and I saw clearly that my party, which I had re-
luctantly increased on my arrival at Moreton Bay, was too large for our
provisions. I therefore communicated to my companions the absolute
necessity for reducing our number. All, however, appeared equally de-
sirous to continue the journey, and it was therefore but just, that those
who had joined last should leave, Mr. Gilbert, however, who would*
under this arrangement, have had to retire, found a substitute in Mr.
Hodgson, who had, perhaps, suffered most by addilkmal fatigues ; so
that he and Caleb, the American negro, prepared for their return to More-
ton Bay. Previous, however, to their departure, they assisted in killing
one of our steers, the meat of which we cut into thin slices and dried in
the sun. This, our first experiment, on the favourable result of which our
expedition entirely depended, kept us during the process in a state of
great excitement. It succeeded, however, to our great joy, and inspired
us with confidence for the future. , . . The daily ration of the party
was now fixed at six pounds of flour per day, with three pounds of dried
meat, which we found perfectly sufficient to keep up our strength.”
We shall see, that in a short time, this allowance was again lessened*
as to flour, by one-half.
The party thus reduced, Leichhardt and his companions proceeded on
their journey. On November 5, as I have said, they came upon the
head waters of the Dawson, which river they followed until the 14th.
Then striking in a northerly direction, they crossed a system of tribu-
taries ; naming Palm Tree Creek and Robinson’s Creek ; but falling into-
the very natural error of giving a westerly course to the latter. Leich-
hardt himself had considerable doubt as to the propriety of this decision*
for he says :
“ I could not decide to my entire satisfaction whether my views were
right, for the country was difficult for reconnoitring, and I was necessarily
compelled to move quickly on to accomplish the object of my expedition ?
but it is a very interesting point for geographical research, and I hope, if
not anticipated by other explorers, to ascertain at some future period, the
course of these creeks and rivers.”

Still pursuing their intended direction over a rather difficult country,
they came in sight of Expedition Eange on the 27th, having by this time
become fully inured to the hardship and privation incidental to such a
journey. Iguanas, opossums, and birds of all kinds they gladly consigned
to the stew-pot as choice variations from the usual meal of dried beef or
kangaroo. Some flour, accidentally spilled on the ground, was carefully
scraped up with dry gum tree leaves, and a small quantity which became
mixed with those natural spoons and an unavoidable portion of dust, was
converted into porridge, which, with the addition of a little gelatine, the
travellers considered they enjoyed. On the 28th they discovered the
Boyd, another tributary of the Dawson, but which Leichhardt seems to
lave thought wended in the same westerly direction that he had assigned
to llobinson's Creek. By December 7, they reached Zanica Creek, whose
bed they found entirely dry, and here they had their first encounter with
the blacks, which fortunately ended in no more mischief than the wound-
ing of a horse. On the 10th, they crossed Expedition Range, ami trav-
elling with varying incident, passed over Alhinia Downs, and reached
tire Comet Creek on the 28th. On the banks of this they found “ the re-
mains of a hut, consisting of a ridge pole and two forked stakes about
six feet high, both having been cut with a sharp tomahawk." This, they
did not doubt, was the work of some unhappy runaway from Morcton
Bay, but they do not seem to have observed or looked for any other sign
of a white man's existence. Still following the creek, they came, on
January 10, 1815, to its junction with a river which Leichhardt named the
Mackenzie. This they travelled along for some time ; and on the 14th.
found in its broad and sandy bed the creeper which we now know as the
Leichhardt or Mackenzie bean. The seeds of this they roasted and used as
a substitute for coffee. On the 18th they left the Mackenzie flowing to
the north-east, and pursued the course of the expedition.
Of the country thus travelled over, Leichhardt’s impression was, upon
the whole, favourable. The frequency and peculiarity of the scrubs
through which he passed struck him as one of its most prominent chaiao
tcristics. Geologically, he found it of sandstone, which, from its accom-
panying coal beds and other indications, he considered identical with the
formation of the Lower Hunter District of New South Wales—althoug.,
in several localities it had been broken by basalt as in the spine of the
Expedition Range. Generally speaking, he thought the country well-
watered ; and, unless whore the brigalow scrub was more than usually
thick, well calculated for pastoral settlement, more especially on the heads
of the Dawson and its tributaries, and between Expedition Range and the
Mackenzie River. This river he supposed to disembogue into Broad
Sound ; a very natural conjecture to anyone unaware of the coast range


by which it is diverted into the Fitzroy. We must, moreover, not forget
that the main object of Leichhardt was not the discovery of country for
settlement, but the practicability of communication between the southern
colonics and the north coast of Australia. That he effected so much in
the way of what may be termed alongside exploration, beyond the mere
line of his route, is as creditable to him as it was ultimately advantageous
to the public. ,
I now return to his journey. Leaving his party engaged in the pro--
cess of drying and packing the carcass of one of their bullocks, he pro-;
ceedcd on a reconnoitring expedition on January 18, accompanied by one
of his blacks. In this he got entangled in the scrubs, and narrowly
escaped losing his track—but the wonderful quickness and accuracy of
observation which his companion possessed, in common with all the
aborigines, was of great service in enabling him to regain his camp, They
then went on their way through a country of alternate flats and scrub,
varied by some rich plains. The wild marjoram which they found here
they collected, adding it to their tea, as well as using it frequently as a
condiment in their soup. On January 20, they crossed Newman's Creek—
a tributary of the Mackenzie —and here Leichhardt planted his last peach
stones, with some apprehension, however, that the frequent fires that over-
ran the country would prevent them reaching maturity. On the same
day he came on the magnificent downs, out of which rise the “ succession
of almost isolated gigantic conical and dome-topped mountains, seeming
to rest with a flat unbroken base on the plains below,” which last he
named, and we know as, the Peak Downs. Unfortunately, the season was
one of drought, and on a reconnoitring expedition on the 27th, both
Leichhardt and Calvert suffered greatly from thirst, finding all the water-
courses dried up. In another expedition, Gilbert, the botanist, found little
water, but observed the sign of an anchor or broad arrow cut into a tree
with a stone tomahawk. Keeping their camp stationary for about a week,
but still exploring round the range, he met fresh objects of admiration
every day. On February 6, they again started in a north-westerly direc-
tion, and got involved in a series of ranges, probably spurs from a second-
ary range connected with the Peak Mountains. Travelling across them,
with their thick vegetation and deep valleys and ravines, was exceedingly
difficult. “ The bullocks upset their loads frequently in climbing up and
down the rocky slopes, and our progress was consequently slow.” On the
lOth he therefore altered his direction to NNE., and came to the head of
Hughes’ Creek in latitude 22° 23'. On the IBth, he reached a river,
which he named the Isaacs, whose bed he found dry. Here he camped by
a water hole on the bank, intending to examine the country in advance,
and by this time he had reduced the six pounds of flour per diem, firstly.


to three, and then to one and a-half. lie had been troubled by the deser.
tion of his two blacks, who had grown discontented and left him, but
after a short interval, returned. Still reconnoitring the country as he
went, he examined Coxen’s teak and Range, and after a short rest on the
Isaacs, continued his journo/ along that river, his blacks occasionally in-
subordinate and troublesome. Now and then he met with the natives,
with whom he seems to have kept on kindly terms. By March 7, he had
come to the heads of the Suttor, down which he travelled for several days,
passed its junction by the Cape or Belyando, until he reached the point
at which it ran into a large river which he named the Burdekin. This
he considers to have formed the boundary of the second division of his
journey, and here he found the most northern habitat of the black swan.
Of the country thus passed over, he formed a higher opinion than of
the previous division. The basaltic character of the plains and open
downs, thinly timbered with open forest, and the luxuriance of the grass
excited his admiration. He, however, expressed fear that the supply of
water would be inadequate to the wants of the settler. In his lecture,
before alluded to, delivered at Sydney, on August 18, 1816, he said ;
“ If, at a close examination, a sufficient quantity of water should be
found, a wide extent of country will be opened to the squatter, who will
travel with his herds without difficulty over the level country along the
Isaacs and its tributaries, and will ascend on gentle ridges to the plains of
Teak Range, and, probably, still further to the westward, beyond another
range of peaks which we perceived in that direction. He will strike the
beautiful country at the head of the Isaacs and the Suttor, over which at
present numerous flocks of emus roam, and fill with animation that im-
mense tract of country which spreads out round the foot of Coxeits
Peaks.”
How far and how beneficially these predictions have been realised,
we shall by and by see.
His course was next up the Burdekin, through a hilly tract, and on
April 5, he bad reached Robey’s Range. Porter’s Range being visible,
and the soil improving, until he came upon a large field of basalt, in lati-
tude 19° 58' Still following the course of the Burdekin, and through a
country of very variable levels, but which he believed to be well adapted
for grazing purposes, lie arrived at the junction of the Clark on the 22nd
of the same month, and of the Perry on the 24th. Crossing the Valley of
Lagoons, and the heads of the Burdekin, he journeyed over the ranges
which divide the heads of the Lynd from those of that river with no
greater trouble than the loss of a horse, which, however, he turned to ac-
count by drying the flesh of the animal for eating. This he thought equal
to that of a bullock, supposing both to be in equal condition ; but hunger
may have had somethin; tc df wit! suc v ar !',ppr->c f 'tior He suffered


considerable privation in his reconnoitring, being on one occasion fifty
hours without water, but the increasing prospect of success seems to have
stimulated himself and his companions to renewed exertion ; and they
had now reached the end of what he considered his third stage, and were
on the verge of the plains whose coast line is formed by the Gulf of Car-
pentaria. He considered this part of the country to be “ characterised by
its supply of running water, by its primitive rocks, its limestone, its
numerous ranges, and its fine, open, well-grassed forest.” If a settlement
■wore established on the east coast, he thought it should be “ at the mouth,
of the Burdekin, which I suppose to be at Cape Upstart on the southern
extremity of Halifax Bay ” —a supposition, unfortunately, not borne out
by subsequent exploration. He noticed the difficulty of communication
from the coast to the interior, bat rightly suggested that “ practicable
roads will no doubt be found in the progress of colonization.” The lapse
of twenty-eight years lias seen strange changes in the condition and pros-
pects of the country traversed by Leichhardt.
Besting awhile, the travellers celebrated the 21th of May (the Queen’s
Birthday) with a “ fat cake,” made of four pounds of flour and some suet,
and with a pot of sugared tea. Sugar they had been without, except for
luxury or as a medicine, for a long time, and their salt was now ex-
hausted. In a little while they became accustomed to relish their food
without either. But privation increased upon them. They pursued their
journey along the Lynd, past Kirchner’s Kange, over rugged country, and,
with considerable difficulty, falling in with frequent native camping
places, until, on June 18, they rested to kill and cure one of their cattle.
“Although,” (says Leichhardt), “we were most willing to celebrate
the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, and to revive our own ambi-
tious feelings at the memory of the deeds of our illustrious heroes, we had
nothing left but the saturated rags of our sugar bags, which, however, we
kept for the purpose, and which we now boiled up with our tea ; our last
flour was consumed three weeks ago, and the enjoyment of fat cake there-
fore was not to be thought of.”
The position was far from enviable, but they had not yet arrived at the
worst. In the lower part of the Lynd they first met with the green tree
ant, a spiteful insect, living in small societies in rude nests constructed
between the green leaves of shady trees : and here they came across the
tracks of an alligator. When they arrived at latitude 15° 51' 2(i", they
determined to leave the Lynd and strike to the west, having first dis-
covered and named its supposed tributary the Mitchell. After travelling
a few days, they began to experience significant indications of the hos-
tility of the natives, which, on the 28 th, culminated in a night attack, in
which Gilbert, the botanist, was killed, and Calvert and Eoper severely


wounded. After burying Gilbert, Leichhardt and the remainder of his
party wearily continued their task, and on July 5, to their great joy, came
in sight of the salt water of the Gulf of Carpentaria. A line of comma-
nication between the south-eastern coast of Australia and the Gulf was at
length opened. Then, by slow stages, they reached the “Albert” of
Stokes iu about a mouth ; crossed the Plains of Promise, and ascertained
their extent, and on September 8, still keeping to the coast line, passed
the line which now marks the western boundary of the colony of Queens-
land. They had thus traversed the fourth and fifth, of the divisions in
which Leichhardt arranged his journey.
His observations on these portions are clear and of considerable in-
terest. He found—
“the same succession of rocks, granite, talchisto, porphyry, and sandstone
in descending to the Gulf which he found at the east coast in as aiding
to the table-laud. But limestone was not to be met with on the west side
of the York Peninsula, though it appeared extensively developed on the
Burdckin. Basalt has broken through the various rocks, but the level
country itself is formed of a clayey ironstone with grains of quartz, which
extended all round the Gulf to Port Essington, and may be considered of
a newer formation. The Lynd was joined by several running creeks, and
was, in its whole course, well supplied with water. The country was.
openly timbered and well grassed.”
Of the Plains of Promise, he remarks ;
“ Should a harbour be found at the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria,,
which might allow ships to approach and moor in safety, it would not
only open this fine country to colonization, but would allow the produce
of the high land of the York Peninsula to be brought down to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, as well as to the east coast. Cattle and horses could be
easily driven from coast to coast, and they would even fatten, as water
and feed are everywhere abundant.”
The Plains of Promise have been opened to colonization, and are now
occupied by herds of cattle, and even the produce of the high land of
York’s Peninsula seems to be no longer problematical.
It is scarcely necessary in a history of Queensland, to extend the nar-
rative of this remarkable journey. Its interest, from the point at which
Leichhardt had arrived, is confined to mere personal adventure, for the
character of the country did not vary much from that of the regions,
which he had recently passed, or, where it did, only repeated the features
of other rugged country over which he had travelled. How far his party
were harassed, may be conceived from their preserving only one of their
bullocks, lasing all their dogs, having been compelled to destroy many
valuable ornithological specimens, and being almost indebted for the pre-
servation of their lives to the offices of friendly natives, whom they met


as they neared Port Essington. On Decamber 17, they reached that set-
tlement weary and worn, having travelled 3,000 miles over a previously
unknown country, and been nearly fifteen months absent from every
trace of civilised society. No overland explorer in Australia has achieved
so much as Leichhardt, and many of them had far more ample means.
He stayed a month at Port Essington, when, a small schooner calling
at the settlement, he embarked for Sydney, where his arrival was wel-
comed, first with surprise, and then with the enthusiasm which anticipated
success is apt to generate. “ All classes pressed forward to testify their
joy at our re-appcarance, ■which we found had been long despaired of, and
to offer their aid in supplying our wants.” The adventurer of 1811 was
the hero of 1816. Rather more than £2,500 —the joint contribution of the
Government and of public subscriptions—was divided in suitable propor-
tions between the party, and the gold medals of the Royal Geographical
Societies of London and Paris were awarded to Leichhardt when the
news reached Europe. Unhappily, he did not live to receive them.
There was something of the spirit of Alexander in the man—conquests
achieved only stimulated to enterprises of greater difficulty.
During all this time the progress of the infant settlement had not
been slow. As I have said, the pressure of the times had compelled the
squatters of New South Wales to turn their attention to fresh modes of
utilizing their flocks and herds than the sale of wool, or of sheep and
cattle for ordinary consumption. Accident had combined with experi-
ment to perfect the process of boiling down carcases for the production of
tallow, and an establishment for such a purpose was founded at Kangaroo
Point, then a suburb of Brisbane, and now a ward of the municipality.
A seam of coal was opened—although with no tangible result—at Red-
bank, on the banks of the Bremer River, the mineral having been previ-
ously discovered, both by Allan Cunningham and Mr. Andrew Petrie, to
extend over a large area of country from that locality in the direction of
the Pine Mountain, about twelve miles north of Ipswich. There was. in
fact, a good deal of general advancement, as well as a spasmodic sort of
energy, which looked promising for the prospects of the district. And,
in the fulness of time, that indispensable accessory of civilization—the
newspaper, was to be established.
For some time, Mr. Arthur Sydney Lyon, a gentleman of good educa-
tion, indomitable energy, and respectable connections, had contemplated
commencing a newspaper in Moreton Bay. The want of such a conve-
nience was beginning to be felt, inasmuch as, save in official reports or in-
frequent private correspondence, the condition, wants, and resources of
the district were almost unnoticed in the parent colony, while its very ex-
istence was tacitly ignored or forgotten in the more distant ones. Many of


the residents who had been accustomed elsewhere to the advantage which
a public journal affords, began to talk o£ its necessity, and an active can-
vass for subscribers resulted in such encouragement to Mr. Lyon, that he
entered into arrangements with Mr. James Swan, a printer, resident at
that time in Sydney, tor the printing and publication of the proposed news-
paper. The inducements held out by him, however, seemed to Mr. Swan,
when he arrived, little likely to be realised. There were but few houses
in Brisbane, and the streets existed only in name. But the assurances of
the settlers calmed his apprehensions. He was told that the interior
would afford advertisements, subscribers, and cash. By degrees the faith
necessary to enterprise was instilled into him, and the J loreton Bay
Courier commenced its existence on June 20, 1846. It was a modest
weekly sheet of four pages, about half the size of an ordinary newspaper,
and was printed in the garrets of a brick building, afterwards occupied ns.
an inn, and since burned down, at the north-west corner of Queen and
Albert Streets, Brisbane. From such a small beginning it has grown with
the growth of the colony into a valuable and important property, and in
connection with the Queenslander, its worthy accompaniment, continues
to hold what Johnson would have called a considerable position amongst
the colonial press.*
The motto chosen by the editor was : “ I am in the place where I am
demanded of conscience to speak the truth and in his first leading
article he became somewhat grandiloquent.
“ The Courier has been established in compliance with the almost
unanimous wish of every resident of character, property, and intelligence
in this extensive district. The unfounded impressions that prevail else-
where respecting the climate, capabilities .and resources of this portion of
the colony, and the absence of those beneficial moral influences which
have their origin in the press, have long rendered a local journal neces-
sary. The commercial importance of the community indeed demands its
introduction. Churches, schools, stores, shops, inns, dwelling houses, and
erections for various purposes, have rapidly risen; settlements have be-
come villages, villages towns. Our staple articles of export —wool and
tallow —have strikingly increased ; and with their increase fresh incite-
ment has been afforded to industry and enterprise. And, as the position
of the grazing and trading classes, who form the bulk of our infant
society, has improved, and population has augmented, prosperity lias
ebreed requirements that can only appertain to an advanced state of
society. Perhaps none is so urgent as that which we aim to supply.”
A week afterwards the heading of the leading article is—“ IVe want
a Bank.”
v I am indented to Mr. Swan for the almost inestimable advantage of tlie perusal o-
a complete file of the Courier from its commencement, which X gratefully acknowledge.


The statistics of Moreton Bay at this time will probably provoke a
smile from the reader, if sought for to substantiate “ the commercial im-
portance of the community.” The number of houses in the then County
of Stanley—which comprised all the country east of the Great Dividing
Range—was, according to a census taken in the preceding March, 255, of
which 41 were of stone or brick, and 214 of wood. But of these, 50 were
unfinished, although only G were uninhabited. The population of North
Brisbane was 483 ; of South Brisbane, 346 ; of Ipswich, 108 ; of the
squatting stations, 452 ; and the military and government establishments
numbered 185. There was the usual disproportion of the sexes—l,l22
males, and 477 females. 538 could not read, and 857 could read and
write. There were 6 lawyers and 6 doctors, 14 clergymen, and 13 “ other
educated persons ” —a rather ambiguous description. Only 23 were en-
gaged in agriculture. On the Darling Downs 551 males and 107 females
formed the population ; 1 doctor served for the diseases of the people ;
and no lawyer being mentioned there, it is to be presumed that none ex-
isted at that time to vex the souls of clients with costs. Of “ other pro-
fessions ” —a puzzling sort of nomenclature—there was 1 ; 147 out of the
whole number could neither read nor write ; and upon the whole, it does
not seem to have been a very literate community. As to religion, the
numbers of the various denominations stood thus : —Church of England,
1,110 ; Church of Scotland, 338 ; Roman Catholics, 675 ; Wesleyan Meth-
odists, 24 ; other Protestants, 59 ; Jews, 10 ; Pagans and Mohammedans
(coolies), 28 ; other persuasions, 13.
Official documents are not always the safest data to adopt. A letter
in the Courier, of July 11, adverting to the number of clergymen sup-
posed to be in the County of Stanley, affirms that there were only two
ministering in the district, one a Roman Catholic, another of the Episco-
pal Church. The others had either left the colony, or abandoned their
functions for more lucrative or less laborious pursuits. The Anglican
minister seems to have had an active time of it, for it is said that he —
not having any residence in town, and having to make frequent tours of
duty among the squatting stations, can only come in occasionally on
Saturday night, perform service on Sunday morning, and start off again
to his labours in the bush either immediately after service or on Monday
morning.”
As a pendant to this description, I may add, that I do not find any
schoolmaster or teacher specially mentioned in the census returns. Such
persons were probably cither non-existent or not thought worthy of men-
tion. But the Darling Downs district even then had 11.000 cattle and
210,000 sheep grazing on its fertile plains.


As a natural consequent, the tax-gatherer came on the heels of the
prosperity which the editor of the Courier depicted in his inaugural
article. A Collector of Customs arrived on June 13, 1846, and his satel-
lites soon followed. The establishment was not a very profitable one, the
expenses of the first year amounting to more than the collections.
Contemporaneously with the new paper, a steamer called the Experi-
ment was started to ply on the river between Brisbane and Ipswich, and a
flour mill and a new saw mill wore projected. The steamer fares between
the two townships were, by the cabin, six shillings ; by the fore-cabin,
four shillings ; freight, per ton, was seven shillings and sixpence, after-
wards reduced to six shillings, and wool was charged at two shillings per
bale. Considering the difficulties which beset the effort, the owner of the
Experiment was singularly moderate, although the fares between Brisbane
and Sydney at the time ranged from £2 to £4. Few of the older resi-
dents of the southern districts will fail to remember the energy and spirit,
which, in a chequered and sorrowful struggle through life, marked every
enterprise of poor Pearce. The greater part of his career in Moreton Bay
may be fitly described as one of experiment. Towards the end of his life,
pain and poverty imparted a querulous irritability to a temper naturally
active and impatient, but it is not easy to appreciate the advantages
which his spirit and example, displayed at a critical time, conferred upon
a community far more willing to complain of defects than to recognise
exertion.
And having thus seen the struggling settlement endowed with a
newspaper, a custom house, and a steamer, I close the chapter.


CHAPTER V.
1816—1849.
Proposed New Northern Colony for Reformed Convicts at Port Curtis—Failure in Disem-
barkation —Abandonment of the Undertaking —Recal of Sir G. Gipps, and Arrival of
Sir Charles Fitzroy—Origin of the Australian Croun Lands System, and the “ Orders in
Council”—The Transportation System, and Influence, of Scarcity of Labour in Gaining
Support for it in the District—Attempt to procure Coolie Labour—First Suggestion of
“Separation”—Social Progress and Condition —Sir Thomas Mitchell's Discoveries—Ken-
nedy's First—Leichhardt's Last Expedition—Courts of Petty Sessions Established—Cha-
racter of the Settlers Vindicated.
While the labours of explorers and the exertions of the settlers
were thus extending the boundaries and disclosing the capabilities of the
district of Morctou Bay, the Home Government were not unmindful of
the facilities it offered to relieve them of one difficulty—that of dealing
with their convicts. Lord Stanley, on March 3, 1846, describing the pro-
posals of the Colonial Office, said, in the House of Lords—
“ the Government to which he belonged had thought proper to appoint an
additional colony to the north of the Colony of New South Wales, be-
yond the limits assigned to that colony, the new colony not being too
near the tropics to prevent its being healthy. It was intended that a
number of these convicts who had reached the most advanced —that waa
the lightest—stage of penal discipline, should go to that colony, where
they would be furnished with provisions for a limited period, and also a
portion of land. They would also be permitted, if they thought proper,
after a certain interval, to emigrate to the adjoining colonies and become
the servants of the outlying population of these eolonies. The class of
convicts who would be sent to the new colony, would be those, who, when
they arrived there, would be in the position of having received a condi-
tional pardon.’’
This proposal met with great favour in the district. The squatters
saw, or thought they saw, a chance of obtaining an almost unlimited sup-
ply of that labour, from the want of which they had suffered severely, as
well as in the new settlement an outlet for their surplus stock. But one
part of the plan was strenuously objected to—the giving land to the con-
victs j thus, in the language of the Courier : “ placing them in a much


■better position than the men of virtuous character.” The inducement to
the “ exiles,” as they were called, to stay in the new settlement, which
such a gift presented, was, it appears to me, more appreciable by the em-
ployers of labour than any argument derived from merely moral con-
siderations. But whatever might have been their opinion, the scheme
once set on foot was prosecuted with vigour. The permanent Under Sec-
retary for the Colonies laid a minute before the Lords of the Treasury,
containing a summary of the principal points ; and, “ My Loras’ ” reply :
“ The necessity of affording relief to Van Diemen's Land is so urgent,
and the obligation upon the Government of finding for the better class of
exiles who have made some progress in reform, a relief from that contam-
ination to which the present state of Van Diemen’s Land exposes them,
is so imperative, that my Lords do not feel justified in refusing their ac-
quiescence in the formation of the new settlement, as proposed by the
Secretary of State for the Colonies—approved as it has also been by the
Secretary of State for the Home Department.”
And so the necessary measures were proceeded with.
By this plan the classes to be sent were two ; all exiles (that is, con-
victs transported with pardons, to take effect immediately on their laud-
ing), and all pardoned convicts in Van Dicman’s Land unable to earn an
independent subsistence. Measures were also to be adopted to secure a
proper proportion of the sexes. Rations, bedding, etc., were to be pro-
vided for the convicts for one year, after which they were to maintain
themselves, professedly on land granted to them for cultivation. £IO,OOO
was to be expended on public works, the settlers contributing labour.
Free emigration was permitted but not encouraged. The staff by which
this population was to be governed, was thus settled : —A superintendent,
at £BOO per annum ; a colonial secretary, at £3OO ; a clerk, at £2OO ; a
chairman of quarter sessions, at £3OO ; a clerk of the peace, at £2OO ; a
sheriff, at £IOO ; a chaplain, at £2.-)0 ; a land surveyor, at £3OO ; and
three magistrates, at £IOO each. The cost would not have been great on
the whole, while the relative importance attached to the offices, as indi-
cated by the salaries, seems curiously at variance with common routine ;
hut the plan contained within itself the elements of failure.
Lieutenant-Colonel Barney, of the Royal Engineers, was appointed
superintendent, and arrived in Sydney in September, 18-16. Early in the
following November, he called in at Moreton Bay in the Comuhia
steamer, having on board with him a surveying staff to assist in determin-
ing the locality of the new settlement. The New South Wales Govern-
ment was in the mean time busy in selecting his subordinates. When
he had chosen a site, in the vicinity of Port Curtis, the superintendent re-
turned to Sydney, and in January, 1847, left for his Government in the
F VOL. I.


Lord, Auckland, which was to be followed by the Thomas Lomry with tha
remainder of the military stores and other necessaries. Sanguine antici-
pations were indulged in of success in the formation of the settlement,
which, it was hoped, would terminate the perplexities of the squatters of
Moreton Bay, and at once supply them with labour and furnish them
with a market.
These anticipations were, perhaps happily, not realised. The first
proceeding indicated the unfitness of the new Governor for his task. In
order to strike terror into the solitude, cannon were brought on deck for
a salute in honor of the special landing ; and such pomp and circumstance
as military and official uniforms, receptions, presentations, and the like
could ensure, were enjoined. In the midst of these preparations, the ship
struck on a sandbank off Fairy Island, and the whole ceremony was dis-
arranged. The crew and passengers landed as best they might, and the
arrival of two small vessels from Brisbane prevented any danger of starva-
tion. After much irresolution, Colonel Barney got to the main land, was
rowed up a creek, and is understood to have decided upon a site for the
town he was not even to lay out; for here his authority ceased. While
waiting in helpless uncertainty whether to stay, or to return to Sydney, a
despatch was received from the Imperial Government announcing that
the letters patent under which North Australia had been created into a
separate colony, would be revoked, and directing that the establishment
formed there should be immediately broken up. Colonel Barney and his
officers were to be employed, as occasion might serve, in the Colony of
New South Wales. There was nothing to be done but to comply with
these directions ; the philanthropic plan of converting “ exiles ” into agri-
culturists was abandoned, and, with that abandonment, the hopes which
had been formed of the supply of labour, and the consumption of stock
for Moreton Bay, faded away also. The only tangible result of the whole,
was a bill for £20,000, the cost of the experiment.
Before Colonel Barney had arrived in Sydney, a change of Governors
had taken place. Sir G. Gipps had become involved in acrimonious con-
troversies with his new Council, which destroyed all hopes of amicable
administration ; his health began to give way, and at length, on July 11,
1846, he left for England. Very much of the acerbity which marked the
disputes prevalent during the latter portion of his governorship, arose
upon questions connected partially with the right of taxation, and promi-
nently with the interests of the pastoral community. These questions,
however, belong more immediately to the history of New South Wales,
and having been discussed at length in the works of Dr. Lang and Mr.
Flanagan, it is scarcely necessary here to repeat a twice-told tale. Sir
George Gipps was succeeded by Sir Charles Augustus Fitzroy, a member


of the ducal family of Grafton, who had previously filled appointments ot
a similar nature, and, as is usual under circumstances like those we have
described, was credited with aH the qualifications in which his prede-
cessors had been supposed to be deficient. Tie landed in Sydney on
August 3, being received with enthusiasm ; his “ .manly and dignified de-
portment,” according to the Sydney Morning Herald, of that day,
•“ seeming to presage golden auguries of his future popularity among us.-’
By way. 1 suppose, of enforcing this opinion, the same journal thus de-
scribes the subject of its prophecy :
“In person, Bir Charles is dignified and commanding ; his counten-
ance agreeable and intelligent; while his manner and bearing eminently
display that dignified courtesy and chastened affability which form the
distinguishing characteristics of a high-born British gentleman.”
Had the new' Governor’s qualifications for government been equal to
the personal ones thus flatteringly attributed to him, he would have found
full occupation for all. The whole colony was in a state of ferment, and
its principal leaders were more or less in collision with the Colonial Office,
on the subjects which provoked it. Foremost of these, was that of the
land laws, which were, at that time, in a very chaotic condition, and on
whose proper nature, then as now', the most contradictory opinions pre-
vailed, Whether the upset price of land on alienation should be five shil-
lings or twenty ; whether of the two—total alienation or sale at a quit
rent —would be most desirable ; what sort of tenure should be given to
the squatters, or whether any certain tenure should be given to them at
all; what should be done with the land revenue, or who should have the
disposal of it ?—these were the questions on which the colonial mind was
sorely exercised, and in which a very puzzling inconsistency was displayed
by both the home authorities and colonial politicians.* Next to this
question, came that of transportation, in which, from the nature of the
community, disputes were constant and bitter, while the ill feeling thus
engendered, was at times exasperated by the tantalizing course pursued
by the Colonial Office, whose authorities clung with great tenacity to the
idea of substituting for the penal system, which had been abandoned, a
reformatory one, in which the colonies should complete the amendment
which Pentonville and Portland, it was hoped, had commenced. And be-
hind the tw'O, and soon to assume equal proportions, was the framing ot
the new Constitution, on which the colony was to be governed ; on which
as great a variety of opinion prevailed as there were politicians to express
* Mr. Robert Lowe, then a barrister in Kyilney, now holding a commanding position
in the Honse of Commons, began by advocating the quit rent system. In a few months
afterwards lie was a warm defender of alienation by sale.
F*


it. The position of an Australian Governor was, at that time, one of
much greater weight and responsibility than it is now ; and I can very
well imagine that Sir Charles Fitzroy’s, between the Colonial Office and
the colony, was not one through whose difficulties a fine person and com-
manding deportment would prove sufficient guides.
In the question of dealing with the Crown lands, the district of More-
ton Bay was seriously interested, and that its importance was thoroughly
apprehended, may be gathered from the meetings and discussions which
constantly took place. Not in the hope of supplying anything approach-
ing to a complete view of the subject, but rather as an assistance to the
read er in estimating its nature, I propose to devote some space to a re vie w
of the legislation connected with it.
Originally the lands of Australia seem to have been dealt with with-
out reference to any sound or even deliberately arrived-at principle of dis-
tribution. In New South Wales they were evidently looked upon as con-
stituting a fund from which to reward services—real or supposed—to
subsidize a favourite, or to supply gratuities to convicts, who by their good
behaviour, seemed to have merited encouragement. After the first estab-
lishment of the convict settlement, in 1788, Governor Phillip made grants
to some free immigrants and a few convicts, on condition of residence and
cultivation. His successors, Hunter and Macquarie, continued the system,
on a largo scale. When Governor Brisbane was appointed in 1821, the
Home Government desired to provide employment for the necessary num-
ber of convicts whom its own opportunities were not sufficient to find
work for ; and emigrants who could show that they had an available
capital of from £3OO upwards, were encouraged to go to the colony by
the promise of grants of land—the grants varying from one hundred
acres to two thousand acres—the grantee undertaking to employ prisoners,
at the rate of one for every hundred acres that he received. While this
system was in operation, the speculative mania of 1825 broke out in Eng-
land, and one of its results was the formation of the Australian Agricul-
tural Company, with a nominal capital of £1,000,000 sterling. To this,
company the Home Government granted a million of acres, with unre-
stricted right of selection ;* and the example they set was followed by
not a few persons of influence in the old country who wanted an opening
* This, however, was moderate, having regard to the Western Australian precedent-
On the settlement -of that colony, enormous grants were made to individuals on very
Blight grounds—the Governor, Sir James Stirling, getting many thousands of acres.

speculators, selling some at threepence and fourpeuce per acre. m differences of a far-

tor epare capital or speculative energy. But the evils arising from the
favouritism or corrupt practices, which such a system engendered, led to
a change, when Sir Richard Bourke —one of the ablest governors that the
■colonies have yet seen—-was appointed in 1831. Sale by auction was
fixed upon as a method of alienation, the general upset price being five
shillings per acre. This was increased to twelve shillings in the adminis-
tration of his successor, Sir George Gipps, and I believe, on his recom-
mendation —that Governor having a somewhat exaggerated idea of the
value of land as a revenue producing commodity, especially town allot-
ments, on. which the most absurdly high prices were fixed. The Wake-
field theory of “ the sufficient price,” on which the colony of South Aus-
tralia was founded, had, at this time, many supporters amongst the liberal
philosophic economists of the old country, who almost alone turned their
to colonial subjects ; and, as that was fixed by its author at £1
per acre, the Government of the day, influenced by the reasonings of the
school to which I have alluded, and the pertinacious representations of
Sir George Gipps as well, increased the upset price to that amount—a
maximum which may be considered to have acquired a species of historic
tenure, after the passing of the 5 and 6 Victoria, o. 3G, in 1842.
But, contemporaneously with the settlement by alienation of land in
the counties or districts which had been proclaimed within the limits of go-
vernment in the colony of New South Wales, another species of occupation
had grown up, which, at first permissive, gradually assumed something of
the appearance of a vested interest, and led to the existence of a class be-
tween which and the ordinary settlers on the soil, and the inhabitants of
the towns, there has been, for many years and throughout the Australias,
.a continuous and sometimes bitter hostility. These were the squatters, or
in the more courteous designation adopted by themselves, the pastoral
tenants of the Crown—a body whose industry has exerted a vast influence
both on the settlement of the colonies and the trade and prosperity of the
•empire at large.
Its commencement was the result of an accident, or rather a com-
bination of accidents, unexpectedly assisting the development of a pre-
meditated, plan. Captain Macarthnr, an officer of the then 102nd regiment
of the line—or New South Wales corps—was, in 1803, sent home from
New South Wales by Governor King in punishment for his conduct in a
duel with a brother officer. Before this he had paid considerable attention
■to the breeding of sheep, having obtained a few pure merinos, which he
crossed with the ordinary coarse-wooled sheep of the colony, and by
degrees formed what would now be considered a very small flock. Some
•of the wool from their fleeces he took home with him, and shortly after
Ms arrival, memorialised the Government on the subject, simply asking


leave to “occupy a sufficient tract of unoccupied lands to feed his flocks.”"
His request might possibly have shared the fate of ninety-nine hun-
dredths of similar applications, had it not been for a quarrel in England
between the woolen manufacturers and their workmen, the latter object-
ing to the employment of anyone who had not been apprenticed to the
trade, and relying on an old prohibitory statute of Queen Elizabeth’s in
their favour. Ultimately, the question turned on, whether wool was an
article of limited —interpreting that as of local —production. Mr. Mac-
arthnr’s specimens were submitted to the manufacturers, who, finding
that they afforded the contradictory proof required, became instant and
zealous in his support. In consequence of that, inst- ’ of a license to-
occupy, he received a grant of 5,000 acres of land, and a promise of 5,000
more if he succeeded in proving the possibility of the export of fine wool
in quantity from New South Wales. He returned to that colony with
some carefully selected sheep from the royal flocks, and continued his
efforts, selling annually a moderate quantity of his produce to settlers
who were desirous of following his example. But he had to bear the dis-
couragement and ridicule which is the natural lot of pioneers who are
venturesome enough to turn from the common path, and have much or all
to learn. By 1820, his flock had reached about two thousand in number,,
three hundred of which were said to be pure merinos ; the whole number
of sheep at that time in New South Wales being about one hundred thou-
sand. Into the difficulties resulting to him from his participation in the
quarrels which unhappily occurred at the time of Governor Bligh's ad-
ministration, and hindered his operations, it is not necessary for me to'
enter.*
Macarthur, however, was not, as has been generally claimed for him
and believed, entitled to claim the sole honor of founding the greatest in-
dustry in Australia. The late venerable Samuel Marsdeu, the first colonial
chaplain in Australia, harassed by the difficulties of his situation, returned
to England from New South Wales with a retiring Governor (Captain
King) early in 1806.
“ He had ” (says his biographer), “discerned the wonderful capaci-
ties of Australia for sheep farming, and having brought home some wool
and found it much approved of by the manufacturers, he therefore ven-
tured to petition George 111. for a couple of merino sheep from the Royal
Farm at Windsor to improve the breed.”
* See “Lang's History of New South Wales.” Through the kindness of the late ilr-
Fitz, Clerk of the Legislative Council, I have read the original report of ilacarthur’s trial
in England for mutiny in the arrest of Bligh. and Lang's statement seems to me to be
thoroughly borne out. The report gives one a curious notion of the state of Government
and of morals in those days.


The king gave him five, which he carried with him on his return, and
found all the resultant advantages he anticipated. The objects to which
the royal gift was to be applied, are described at length in the thirteenth
chapter of this volume ; but that he is entitled to share with Macarthur
all the honors of a pioneer in the growth of colonial wool for British
manufacturers, there cannot be a shadow of a doubt.
When Macarthur and Marsden had demonstrated that wool of the re-
quired quality could be produced, they became prophets in the eyes of
those who had derided them. The age of testimonials not having then ar-
rived, their admirers desired to recognise their sagacity by participating
in their success. The Government encouraged the pursuit by granting
annual licenses for free occupation. One of the most ultra of the old
squatting school thus summarises the progress it made, and the aims that
progress suggested:— _ ;
“ The lands were lying waste ; the Government very wisely en-
couraged their occupation, and licensed any free and respectable person
who wished to occupy them. Commissioners were appointed to manage
these waste lands, and the occupants voluntarily paid an assessment to de-
fray the Commissioners’ expenses' and that of the police under their direc-
tion, so that their occupation might not cost the Government anything.
But in the course of time when nearly all the available lands within a
practicable distance were occupied, great evils were experienced from the
arbitrary acts of these functionaries, who assumed great power in defining
the extent of runs by lessening one run to enlarge another. They were
accused of receiving bribes, and of acting very unfairly between man and
man. The occupants were powerless against the Government, as they had
only an annual license —they could not be otherwise than dissatisfied —
they required a better tenure to secure them against the irresponsible acts
of an arbitrary Governor and his needy subordinates.”*
The squatting license fee was £lO per annum. Sir George Gipps
wished to compel the licensee, in addition to the payment of his fee and
assessment, to buy annually 320 acres of his run, at a £1 per acre, the
revenue thus raised to be applied to the increase of immigration. This
was felt as a great grievance by the squatters, and was protested against
as illegal and unconstitutional by many who had little general sympathy
with them —foremost among whom was the Kev. Dr. Lang. When the
squatters published their counter proposals, he, with equal vigour, con-
tested their justice ; they in turn resented his opposition and forgot his
advocacy.
• The Crown Lands of Australia. By William Campbell, M.L.C. Blackwood, Lon-
don and Edinburgh, 1855, p. 10. Campbell went to England as the representative of the
Victorian squatters, to advocate their right to a " preferable right of purchase ” over the
whole or any part of their runs, and this book was part of hia advocacy.


Whether their wishes were reasonable or not, the industry had grown
to such dimensions by the period of which I am now writing, that direct
legislation was acknowledged on all sides to be required. The export of
wool, which had been under eighty thousand pounds weight in 1819,
reached in 1845, 17,364,734 lbs., and the time had obviously arrived for
dealing with tenure of the land, of which so large a production necessi-
tated the occupation. After much petitioning, wrangling, and correspon-
dence, the Act 9 and 10 Victoria, c. 104, was passed in 1846, and, under that
Act, the celebrated orders in Council, which have been regarded as the
Magna Charta of the squatters’ tenure, were issued in March of the fol-
lowing year.
The orders were simple enough in arrangement, but not always clear
in expression. By them the colony of New South Wales was divided into
“settled,” “intermediate,” and “unsettled ” districts. In Morcton Bay the
settled districts comprised the then County of Stanley, and all lauds lying
within three miles from the sea “ measured in a straight line it had no
“ intermediate ” district, and therefore the great bulk of the land was
treated as “ unsettled.” By the rules to be enforced in such a district,
leases of runs for fourteen years were authorised to be granted for pas-
toral purposes, the lessee having permission to cultivate for his own use,
but not for sale or barter. The minimum annual rent to be paid for any
run was to be £lO, the carrying capability not being allowd to be less
than for four thousand sheep, or an equivalent number of cattle, accord-
ing to a scale to be fixed by the Governor ; and £2 10s. per annum was to
be added for every additional thousand that the run might be estimated
as able to carry. The mode of estimate and payment I need not trouble
the reader with. During the continuance of the lease of a run, the land
was not to be open to purchase by any other person than the lessee, and
to him in quantities of not less than one hundred and sixty acres at a
time, and at a minimum price of £1 per acre, the Governor having the
power of increasing it if he saw fit. No lot thus sold was to have a water
frontage of greater proportion than 440 yards, “ reckoned in a straight
line,” to 160 acres in quantity. The ninth section of the second chapter
reserved to the Government the power of granting or selling—
“any lands within the limits of the run, or lands comprised in such lease,
for public purposes, or disposing of, in such other manner as far as the
public interest may seem best, such lands as may be required for the sites
of churches, schools, or parsonages, or for the construction of high roads,
railways, and railway stations, or other internal communications, whether
by land or water ; or for the use or benefit of the aboriginal inhabitants
of the country, or for public buildings, or as places for the interment of
the dead, or places for the recreation and amusement of the inhabitants
of any town or village, or as the sites of public quays, or landing-places


<m the sea coast or shores of navigable streams ; or for the purpose of sink-
ing shafts, and digging for coal, iron, copper, lead, or other minerals ; or
for any other purpose of public defence, safety, utility, convenience, or
enjoyment, or for otherwise facilitating the improvement and settlement
of the colony ; but so that the quantity of land which may be granted or
sold to any railway company shall not exceed in all the rate of one hun-
dred acres for every mile thereof in length.”*
In the case of a railway being made through an unsettled district, all
lands within two miles of the line might be resumed, and sold “at th ■ end
of each successive year ” from the date of the lease. Occupants of Crown
lands who had been in licensed occupation for one year before the order
in Council came into effect, and all who had been occupants for a shorter
period were, at the expiration of twelve months from the date of their li-
cense, declared entitled to demand leases of their respective runs. There
were several provisions for tenders for new runs, and for determination of
the right as between competitors for a run, which it is not necessary to
recount here ; but one of those relating to forfeiture is worth quoting, as
illustrative of the supposed, or, as some say, the real character of the
times: —
“In the event of his (the lessee’s) conviction by a justice of the dis-
trict for any offence against the law, the case may be enquired into within
three months after the conviction by two or more justices who, if they
think fit, may judge the lease to be forfeited, with or without compensa-
tion for the value of the improvements, according to the nature of the
offence.”
It must have been consolatory to the possible subjects of such a regu-
lation to know that any forfeiture thus decreed required the sanction ci
the Governor before it could be put in force. The fifteenth section wac of
more general importance. Upon the expiration of a lease, the lessee w;. a
to have the option of buying the run at a valuation of it in its unim-
proved state, starting with a minimum of twenty shillings per acre. If
declined by the previous lessee, the improvements were to be valued and
the upset price was to be calculated on the joint value of the land and im-
provements, the worth of the latter to be paid to the previous occupant.
If no part of the run were sold, the lessee was entitled to a renewal at a
rent estimated on its carrying capability in its improved state, but not to
be increased by more than fifty per cent, on the old rent; if not mere
than one-fourth were sold, he was entitled to a renewal for the remainder
on the same conditions, but nothing was said of what was to be done if
more than one-fourth were alienated. In the intermediate districts the
leases were to be for only eight years, power being reserved of resumption

at any time on compensation for improvements, and sixty days’ previous
notice. In the settled districts the leases were to be from year to year.
Contemporaneously with giving effect to these orders within the
colony, an Act to regulate the assessment on stock depastured outside the
settled districts, was passed in the Legislative Council. The rate was
fixed at a halfpenny for every sheep, three halfpence for every head of
cattle, and threepence for every horse ; the owners of runs being required
to make returns of the numbers of each description depastured by them.
I have gone more into detail on this subject than may at first sight be
interesting to the general reader ; but it is to be remembered, that these
orders formed the grounds for agitation and dispute up to the time that re-
sponsible Government was conceded to the colonies ; that they were long
after that time resorted to as a sort of text book of land legislation ; and
that a correct apprehension of their bearing is essential to a right under-
standing of the disputes which, for years, raged between the pastoral
lessees and their opponents, as to the rights of run-holders, and the most
just and expedient method of dealing with the public lands. I have not,
however, thought it necessary to overload this history by any recapitula-
tion of the numerous subsidiary regulations that were issued subsequently
as to the detailed method of carrying the Orders and Assessment Act into
effect.
Looking back at the orders, after a lapse of nearly thirty-five years,
they seem to me to have been framed in a very indulgent spirit towards
the class most interested. It had substantially what it asked —security of
tenure until the public requirements called for the resumption of the
land ; and it had leases of a length which, to men who had been subject
to a yearly and uncertain license —and in the colonies where the long
terms, general in the old country, were then, and are even now, unknown
—must have been more favourable than could reasonably have been, or,
in fact, was, anticipated. Nevertheless, the orders were received with a
good deal of grumbling in the district of Moreton Bay j but in some
respects, on grounds directly opposite to those taken up by the class who
had been most clamorous for the settlement, with which they now pro-
fessed to be discontented. The restriction of the lease to a minimum,
which, as the carrying capacity of the land was then estimated, involved
large areas on whose extension no limitation was set, and the prohibition
of cultivation, were specially attacked.
“We had long indulged” (wrote the Courier, with great pertinency)
“ the hope, that some encouragement would have been given to agricul-
turists as well as sheep farmers. Why the two classes should not have
been put on the same footing with respect, to the licensed occupation of


the land, wc are at a loss to comprehend ; or why the poor man, with his
EOO or 1,000 sheep, should not have been permitted to occupy a portion of
this vast territory, we are likewise unable to conjecture. The small farm
system, which has found many able advocates in this colony and else-
where, is thus effectually knocked on the head, and the poor, industrious
man can never hope to rise to a higher grade than that of a labourer.”
More weight than would otherwise attach to this objection, accrues
from the fact, that it was urged by what was regarded as a squatter’s ad-
vocate at the time. The forfeiture clause, which made the legally unim-
peached moral character of a lessee—as determinable by, it might be,
hostile Justices of the Peace, who could try him for “ any offence,” and
on their own mere motion—an essential condition to the retention of a
run, improved or not, was regarded as a covert insult to the whole class of
squatters. IV hat was most to be regretted, was the careless and blunder-
ing phraseology of the ninth or general reservation clause in the second
chapter of the orders, which left an opening for those claims by lessees as
against the public to the freehold of their runs, when the discovery of
gold had enormously increased their value, which formed the subject of
that lengthened controversy which has left behind it so much distrust and
ill-feeling. Great outcry was made by the “ Liberal ” party against the
fourteen years’ leases, as what was called looking-up the country from set-
tlement, but, perhaps, with insufficient reason. When the country was
wanted, as in Victoria, it was taken. No one could at the time have anti-
cipated the gold discoveries, and had not they occurred, it is questionable
if the leases might not have been renewed in the majority of instances for
another fourteen years without detriment to the public interest.
This, however, was the condition in which the new Governor found
the land laws —a settlement like the conclusion of Kasselas —in which
nothing was concluded, at least in the estimation of the public, who were
supposed to be satisfied. They wore displeased with the upset price, and
discontented with the auction system ; some thinking the laud laws too
liberal, and the great majority denouncing them as narrow in principle
and unjust in operation. Karl Grey looked at his work with considerable
complacency—he had, as he thought, got rid of a troublesome agitation,
in reality he had laid the foundation for half a dozen, each still more
troublesome.
On the transportation question, there was at this time, little outward
difference of opinion in the district of Morcton Bay. The introduction of
the convict, fresh from conviction and sentence, all agreed on objecting
to ; but the establishment of some scheme for the admission of prisoners
who had sowed a portion of their time, and, by apparent good conduct,
earned some remission of punishment, met with favour by the majority of


the then scanty population. Transportation in its old form had been dis-
continued since 1840, and it was so well understood by the colonists that
it was never to be renewed, that Mr. Gladstone, in opening the subject,
did not care to contravert the reasonableness of the impression. But his
successor, Earl Grey, had his own view on the subject, and most of the
squatters and a considerable number of the population of New South
Wales, headed by the celebrated William Charles W T cutworth (a lawyer of
extraordinary force of character and splendid oratorical powers), were not
wanting in effort to assist him in carrying them into effect. Judging
from the tone of the Courier of that da}', I should judge, that in this part
of the then colony, the friends of the “ exiles,” the mild term thou in
fashion, were in the ascendant.
That the want of labour had a principal effect in determining the
course pursued by the settlers in the then outlying districts of New South
W r ales, I cannot, doubt. In their despair they turned to all quarters
whence they hajd reason to suppose it might be obtained—to China, to
the South Seas, to India ; but while they were thus troubled, a despatch
from Mr. Gladstone, dated April 80, 1846, to the Governor of New South
Wales, gave a new direction to their efforts. In that letter, while dis-
claiming anything like a renewal of the old system of transportation, or
suggesting any definite plan, he stated that—
-41 it would be acceptable to Her Majesty's Government if the members of
the Legislative Council of the colony should show a disposition to concur
in the opinion, that a modified and carefully regulated introduction of
convict labour into New South Wales, or into some part of it, may, under
present circumstances, be advisable.”
The hint was sufficient to arouse the anxious squatters into immediate
activity. The Legislative Council sittings commenced on October 8, and
a select committee to enquire into and report upon the despatch was im-
mediately appointed. The committee brought up their report on the 31st.
In that document they recommended the annual importation of five thou-
sand male and an equal number of female convicts of the milder kind ;
a simultaneous free immigration being carried out to a similar extent.
A few days afterwards, and immediately before the Council was pro-
rogued, the report was ordered to be printed for general information and
discussion, a similar privilege being denied to a petition against transpor-
tation in any shape, which had been presented by Mr. Charles Cowper.
While the main matter was thus left in abeyance, the stockholders of
the district held a meeting at Ipswich, at which it was resolved to petition
the superintendent of the intended colony of North Australia to permit
“ the departure of a certain number of expirees from North Australia in


search of work immediately on their arrival at the seat of your Govern-
ment.” A strong article appeared in the Courier, advocating the course
recommended, but as the proposed settlement fell through, nothing came
of the meeting, or of the dinner which followed, or of the article which
may bo supposed to have derived some vigour from that convivial termina-
tion. Disappointed so far, the squatters held another meeting at Brisbane
on May 31, to consider a proposition made for the importation of labour
from Van Diemen's Land, and from the South Sea Islands, when resolu-
tions approving the plan, were earned, and subscriptions entered into, but
Ido not see that anything further was done in the matter. Subsequently
an Imperial circular, prohibiting the transportation of criminals from one
colony to another, was sent to the Government of New South Wales, and
thus anything like the forced introduction of labour from the other
colonics became impracticable. The importation, however, of “ exiles ”
kept hold of the attention both of the home and colonial governments.
When the Legislative Council re-assembled in Sydney in April, ISIS, the
subject was again alluded to in the Governor’s speech, and a despatch of
Earl Grey’s, relative to it, was laid before the Council. Ilis lordship, al-
though not assenting to the views previously stated by that body in the
report of their committee, yet adopted the principles it embodied, and the
Council lost no time in meeting his wishes. On April 6, they passed a set
of resolutions pledging themselves to co-operate with Her Majesty’s Go-
vernment in carrying out the policy recommended —unconscious that the
Secretary for the Colonies had anticipated their resolve by despatching in
the previous December a small detachment of “exiles” in the Mount
Stuart Eljihinstone, which reached Sydney, via Hobarton, on June 6. This
does not, however, seem to have disturbed the friendly feeling now ap-
parently established —and the renewal of this modified form of transpor-
tation seems to have been accepted as a certainty.
Contemporaneously, as I have said, great efforts were made to devise
means for bringing free immigrants to the district, and constant com-
plaints were made that its wants did not receive clue attention from New
South Wales. The complaints seem to me to have been loader than the
efforts to remove their cause were genuine. Immigration to New South
Wales, which had been for some time intermittent, was resumed in
August, 1817, but the intelligence did not deter the stockholders and em-
ployers of labour from meeting in Brisbane in January, 1818, to form an
association for the importation of labour from India. Between three and
four hundred labourers were subscribed for, and the Governor was memo-
rialised to assist in getting some of the restrictions which were in force in
India on that sort of traffic removed. The Government, however, refused
to interfere, on the ground that the proposed conjoint introduction of


“exiles ” and free immigrants rendered that of Indian labour unnecessary
—a conclusion which the deputation, charged with presenting the memo-
rial, combatted, because “the Indian immigrant was more adapted than
the European one for the purposes of shepherding ” —an argument whose
force the New South Wales Government declined to admit. Whether dis-
couraged by this reception, or hopeful of the arrival of “ exiles,” I cannot
say, but as far as practical results are concerned, the Indian Labour As-
sociation went the way of its predecessors. The station of Burraudowan,
in the Burnett District, was, 1 am told on undoubted authority, formed
during this year, by Mr. Gordon Sandeman, one of our oldest and must
respected colonists, entirely with Coolie labour imported by himself. The
experiment he regarded as altogether successful, and not the least note-
worthy incident connected with it, is, that one of the Coolies marrying,
is now in an independent position in business in Queensland, while two of
his sons carried off prizes more than once at their school examination.
Twenty-seven free immigrants arrived from Sydney in April, but although
described as “decent and orderly,” they do not seem to have hcen received
as if their coming had been very anxiously looked for, and while the resi-
dents were pondering over the best means of getting a cheaper description
of labour, the dissolution of the Legislative Council gave a new direction
to their thoughts. But before it broke up, the Governor laid before it a
despatch from Earl Grey, recommending a colonial loan for free immigra-
tion, not exceeding in the whole, £40y,000, and re-payable by instalments
in two or three years. The only interesting portion of that document to
the historian of Queensland, is the following paragraph :
“ Bearing in mind the probability of a future separation of the
northern from the southern districts of the colony, a separate account
should be kept of the expenditure incurred for immigration into each,
in order that the debt may eventually be divided between them in the
same proportion.”
This shows that even then an early division was not unfamiliar to his
lordship’s mind.
But before that question could assume any definite shape, that of the
constitution under which both the parent colony and those separated from
it were to be governed, called for settlement. It was quite evident that
the system which prevailed at the time was one which could not last.
The people were becoming more and more discontented with it; the lead-
ing politicians of the colony were dissatisfied with its partial exclusion of
them from any higher function than that of mere assent or dissent; and
they found every avenue to political power closed against them. In the
Legislative Council they exercised the slightest possible control over


either taxation or expenditure, and none whatever in the choice of the
ministers of the day, by whom they were outvoted at will. All legisla-
tion on the most important matters affecting the public interest was de-
nied to them, and their influence was in reality confined to the extent to
which they might act upon public opinion—an opinion, whose expression
found its way to the Home Government almost as, and when, the Go-
vernor and his advisers thought proper. But while few denied the griev-
ance, there was scant agreement as to the precise form the remedy should
assume. There were, of course, multitudinous and irreooncileable sugges-
tions, and the Abbe Sieyes might have found work after his own heart in
their incorporation into one or other of the constitutions, of which he
was so prolific an author. Besides, the distribution of the population had
very much changed since the establishment of the 18-13 Council, and as it
was understood that the new one now to be elected would have to deal,
at least suggestively, with electoral legislation in all its branches, there
was, in the centres of population, no small agitation and controversy on
the main points at issue. To assist the colonists, Earl Grey transmitted a
despatch to Governor Fitzroy, in July, 1817, in which, while announcing
the intention of the Home Government to separate the Port Phillip Dis-
trict from the colony of New South Wales, he discussed at some length
the leading principles upon which representative institutions should be
carried into effect. Very few of his conclusions—to some of which more
detailed reference will be required hereafter —were acted upon, but there
is one paragraph which I think worth quotation, as the evils and com-
plaints it describes, were very much like those with which, after an inter-
val of nearly thirty years, we are familiar at the present time.
“Local self-government” (says Earl Grey), “if necessary for the
good of the whole colony, is not less necessary for the good of the several
districts of which it is composed. For this reason it was that Parliament
provided for the erection throughout New South Wales of municipal cor-
porations, which should, in various respects, balance and keep in check
the powers of the Legislative Council. By this method it was supposed
that the more remote districts would be able to exercise their fair share of
power, and to enjoy their proper influence, in the general policy of the
whole province. But the result has disappointed this expectation. The
municipalities have only a nominal existence—the Legislative Council has
absorbed all the other powers of the colonial state. The principle of self-
government in the districts most remote from Sydney, is therefore acted
upon almost as imperfectly as if the conduct of local affairs had remained
under the same management and institutions as those which the existing
system superseded. Members, it is true, are chosen to represent those dis-
tricts in the Legislature ; but it is shown that such of the inhabitants of
Port Phillip as are really qualified for this trust, are unable to undertake
it at the expense of abandoning their residences and their pursuits in the
southern division of the colony. Thus the Port Phillip representation has


become an unreal and illusory, not a substantial, enjoyment o£ govern-
ment.”*
It docs not seem as if these observations, weighty and well-founded
as they were, sank to any depth in the minds of colonial statesmen at the
time, or ever bore much fruit afterwards.
If we turn from public topics general to the colony to those which
specially concerned the district, we shall find something to interest us.
In so small a community the local events would almost, as a matter of
course, be comparatively unimportant, but, nevertheless, not to be passed
without notice. One of the principal wants—a bank—from time to time
engaged attention. A regulation agreed to by the Sydney institutions,
that they would honour no cheque payable otherwise than to “ bearer,” or
for a less sum than £2, and suggesting that, to prevent loss, all cheques
should be crossed through some bank, excited great wrath in the district,
especially the restriction to £2, which, it was alleged, would be productive
of great inconvenience to employers and small storekeepers. Some
months afterwards the limitation was lowered to £l. The absence of a
bank and the want of silver, led to the adoption of a system of what were
called “ calabashes ” —orders drawn upon some agent of the drawer, pay-
able at various dates after presentation, and often for very small amounts.
If the drawer were a squatter of anything approaching to established
character, the order would remain in circulation for a long time ; and I re-
collect that so late as 1860,1 received in change at an hotel in Toowoomba
an order for thirteen shillings and sixpence, drawn upon a Sydney firm
by a late Colonial Treasurer —which order was then throe years old, and
in the multitude of its endorsements, looked like a collection of auto-
graphs, not of the most intelligible kind. Considerable loss was some-
times sustained by the holders of these documents, who compensated
themselves occasionally by high charges for discounting them for the first
possessors ; and the establishment of a branch bank was, from various
motives, longingly looked for.
The want of one did not, however, abate the appetite or seem to cramp
the means available of the residents for pleasure. Horse racing then, as
now, was a leading amusement ; and in the first number of the Moretvn
Bay Courier the leading description is of the Moreton Bay annual races.
Unfortunately, the account does not specify the total values of the prizes
run for ; but for the edification of the curious in such matters, I can give
a list of the stakes at the Anniversary Meeting in May, 1817. The races
lasted three days. On the first day there were the Brisbane Town Plate

of £25, entrance, £2 10s. ; the Maiden Plate of £2O, entrance, £2 ; and
the Welter Stakes of £2O, entrance, £2. The second day offered a
Hurdle Race for £2O, entrance, £2 ; and a Hack Hurdle Race of £ls, en-
trance, £1 10s. The third day seems to have been the busiest: there was
the Publicans’ Purse of £25, entrance, £2 10s. ; the Ladies’ Purse of £2O,
entrance, £2 ; the Tally-ho Stakes of £2O, entrance, £2 ; the Beaten
Stakes of £lO ; and the Hack Race of £5, entrance, 10s. The little com-
munity squeezed out £IBO for prizes, although the Courier complains that
Ipswich and the back country had held aloof.* About six months after
these races, a regatta was carried out with great spirit, but although the
Brisbane Race Committee have had a plentiful series of successors
throughout the colony, aquatic sport seems to have been rather intermit-
tently pursued.
Business and pleasure were subjected to a sad interruption in March,
184-7, by the wreck of the Sovereign steamer, at the Southern Passage to
Moreton Bay, when on her voyage to Sydney. In crossing the bar at that
passage, her machinery, which appears to have been originally unfit for
the work required of it, broke down, and the vessel drifted until it struck,
breaking up, from the unsound condition of the timbers and planking,
immediately it touched the ground. Out of fifty-four persons on board,
only ten were saved ; and of these, three were severely injured. Judging
4 by the contemporary accounts, it is difficult to say where most blame was
attached —to the culpable overloading of the steamer, or to the careless-
ness, or something worse, of the Hunter River Company in employing so
crazy a vessel on such a service. Protest seems to have been of little
avail, as, on more than one occasion subsequently, I find that overloading
was compelled to be thrown overboard from the company’s steamers, to
save the vessels and the lives of the passengers. There were no Plimsolls
* In the evening tbe “ boys ” kept it up in North Brisbane in grand style, under the
able leadership of a gent well-known to the sporting fraternity. It so happened on this
particular night that a hogshead of beer was quietly reposing under the verandah of the
Victoria Hotel, when it was observed by the boys aforesaid. The word was passed, and
the cask was set in motion down Queen Street, as far as the comer of Albert Street.
Finding the amusement highly exhilarating, our heroes commenced rolling it back again
up the hill, and got it as far as the green opposite the Post Office (nearly to George
Street). Here a council of war was held, and it was decided to make a manful attack
upon the head, as being the most vulnerable part of the cask. This was soon accom-
plished, and a general invitation was given to imbibe the contents, which was accepted
by numbers who had assembled to witness the fun. “ Capital stuff, Ned, is it not ?" said
one. “ Old Tooth is a brick,” said another; and all agreed that it was an excellent
remedy for cold. Suffice it to say, that nearly the whole was drunk by our Bacchanalians
and their guests, without the slightest compunctious visitmgs or wry faces.— Moreton Bay
Courier, May 29,1847,

in those days ; but it resulted from the loss of the Sovereign, that an agi-
tation was set on foot for the survey of Moreton Bay, in order that a
lafcr entrance might be, if possible, discovered. The New South Wales
Government were disinclined to defray the expense, or to undertake the
work ; but, as Captain Wickham was willing to superintend the survey,
they graciously permitted him to do what they were too parsimonious or
too careless to attempt themselves.
In one thing the interest, or the patriotism, of New South Wales, was
industrious. There was no slackness, since the success of Leichhardt, in
forwarding exploration, although sometimes the zeal displayed was more
conspicuous than discretion. Leichhardt himself was restless and eager,
after the novelty of his welcome had worn off, to adventure once more
into the unknown regions to the westward, but now with the intention of
crossing the continent from the Moreton Bay District to Swan River. He
pursued his design with characteristic energy. On September 21,18-Ki, he
attended a meeting at Sydney to receive a testimonial there presented to
him, and in less than a fortnight afterwards, was heard of as starting
from Raymond Terrace in New South Wales, to join the other members
of his company, who were to come to Moreton Bay by sea, and meet him
on the Darling Downs. Ilis party and equipment were mustered at
Oakey Creek, on November 21. He left on December 2 for Jimbour (then
spelt Jimba, which is probably the correct orthography), which was to be
his point of departure. He took with him Mr. John Mann, Mr. Hovendcn
Hely, Mr. Bunoe (a well-known botanist), Mr. Turnbull, and a saddler
and a tanner, and two aboriginals. His travelling stock were fourteen
horses, sixteen mules, 270 goats, 90 sheep, and 40 head of cattle, as well
as a moderate supply of stores. His intention was to follow on his old
tracks until he reached the Peak Downs, and then to turn westward on
his new exploration. Vague reports of his movements reached the settle-
ment occasionally, but nothing definite was known until certain news
came that he had returned with his party to the Condamine on July 31.
From the narrative given in the Courier, I gather that all of the party,
with the exception of Leichhardt himself and his blacks, had been at-
tacked by fever at the Comet River, where they were detained by floods.
When these had gone down, he pushed on for the Mackenzie, which the
party crossed, and camped on the north bank. Here they turned their
goats adrift, but persevered in reaching the Peak Downs, where they anti-
cipated a bracing atmosphere and renewed health : but fresh misfortune
hefel them in the loss of most of their bullocks and a considerable number
of their mules and horses. Discouraged by these repeated disappoint-
ments, Leichhardt determined to return to the Condamine, and, with new
associates, attempt to discover some more favourable route ; so they


turned back, leaving behind a quantity of their stores, which might have
■encumbered them, and, after a miserable journey, arrived at Mr. Bligh’s
station in a very pitiable condition.
Sir Thomas Mitchell, then Surveyor-General, had started in Novem-
ber, 1845, on an expedition for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of
the country to the west and north-west of Moreton Bay, and, skirting the
centre of Australia, of reaching Port Kssington, which last attempt was,
however, abandoned. In the course of his journey he discovered the
■country which he named Fitzroy Downs, and the Maranoa River. Fur-
ther on he found the sources of the Warrego, and thereafter followed down
the bed of a river falling nor ( th-west, which he named the Victoria, and
believed would find its estuary in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In portions
of his journey he crossed the route which had been previously pursued by
Leichhardt, although of course not aware of that at the time, and hence
•arose some confusion of names which for a time perplexed geographers.
His descriptions were vivid, his language vigorous, his anticipations san-
guine, especially as to the great river on which he lavished all his elo-
quence. But a subsequent exploration by Mr. Kennedy, who had been
one of his assistants, proved Sir Thomas to have been premature in his
■conclusions. The Victoria was by no means a permanent stream, and, ul-
timately turning in a south-western direction, became dissipated in a
number of small channels, and was finally lost in the sandy plains of the
interior. Kennedy identified it with the Cooper’s Creek of Captain Sturt,
which had been discovered by that explorer in his South Australian Ex-
pedition. Sir Thomas’s glowing descriptions induced the late Mr. Charles
Coxeu, accompanied by Mr. Pinnock and a native black, to venture on an
explanatory tour to the Fitzroy Downs, which, however, they thought,
■did not justify Vtchell’s eulogies, and their subsequent report seems tc
have deterred some who intended to form stations on that part of the
■country from making the attempt, at least, at that time.
But Sir Thomas Mitchell’s narrative induced Leichhardt to start,
after a day or two’s rest, ou an expedition to the Fitzroy Downs to ex-
amine the nature of the country. It seems tolerably clear that he did not
then find them, although more than once on the tracks of both Mitchell
■and Kennedy. He does not appear to have thought very highly of the
country for settlement; and, having returned to the Condamine, hastened
to Sydney to renew his preparations for a final start. Here, too, he met
with a relative, a Mr. Classen, touching whose real fate there has been
much painful uncertainty. The two left Sydney on December 4 ; arrived
•at Rosenthal on the Darling Downs about February X, 1848 ; and, on the
13th, were in Brisbane, completing their equipment. On the 16th, they
left on their last journey. Leichhardt had with him, besides Mr. Classen,
a*


a Mr. Entinok, formerly of the Hunter River District; a man named Don-
ald Stuart, who had been in the service of the Messrs. Leslie at Canning-
Downs ; another man named Kelly ; and two aboriginals. The party
had with them fifty fat bullocks, twenty mules and six horses, with what
was described at the time as a complete equipment. He proposed to follow
a river, called, by Mitchell, the Cogoon, to the Victoria River, following
that explorer’s tracks as far as might be necessary to enable him to dis-
cover the course of the northern waters, and then bearing off westerly for
Swan River. The last heard from him was a letter to the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, dated April 4, 1848, and written at a sheep station not far
from Mount Abundance. A day or two afterwards, he left Mount Abund-
ance with his party —and, thenceforward, was no more seen of his fel-
lows, and became a memory and a name.
Some comments were made after his departure on the change in his
associates, and Mr. Bunco vindicated himself as to his secession in a letter
of some bitterness, on the ground that it was by Leichhardt’s own wish
that the connection was broken off. Mr. Classen, Leichhardt’s relative,
took Bunco’s place ; and, irrespective of what causes of dispute might
have arisen in the first and abortive attempt, Leichhardt might have pre-
ferred a solitary friend, and beyond him only subordinates who were that
and nothing more, to associates of sufficient standing and position to form
and act upon their own opinions. Modest in bearing reputation, he
seems to have been avaricious in engrossing it —a failing the more to be
regretted in his case, because it is possible, that under different arrange-
ments, his danger might have been lessened, and his fate more fortunate j
but no one can deny his general disinterestedness, his indefatigable
energy, his indifference to privation, and his zeal in the pursuit of that
branch of knowledge of which he was so devoted a follower, and in which
his fame stands second to none.
While Leichhardt was thus engaged in the task of scientific explora-
tion, what may bo called exploration for settlement, was being vigorously
pushed on. Mr. Burnett, an assistant surveyor in the New South Wales
survey department, left Brisbane for the Downs country, on March 1,
1847, with the intention of tracing the waters of the Boyne River, to itj
supposed mouth in Hervcy’s Bay. In this, however, he was prevented by
the difficulties resulting from the nature of the country, and, after travel-
ling as far as his means admitted, returned to Brisbane. He again left
there on July 20, in his boat, with a crew of seven men, and reaching
Hcrvey’s Ray, proceeded up the “ shallow inlets” of Flinders’, which he
found to lie the openings he was in search of. Journeying up the river,
he at length connected it with the point he had reached by land, and hav-
ing satisfactorily ascertained this, he examined Wide Bay, and the river


debouching into it. Of the Boyne, or of the country on its banks, he
thought little, but the Wide Bay River, as it was called, he considered the
opening for some future important settlement. On receipt of his report,
the Governor directed that the name of the River Boyne should be
changed to the “ Burnett,” and of the Wide Bay River to the “ Mary.”
Thus was the first step taken towards the location of the now important
town of Maryborough.
While the work of exploration was thus going on, new roads and new
settlements were following its tracks, and new stations forming. In May,
1817, a new road over the Range, and south of Cunningham’s Gap. was
found and marked; and, farther north, a road was traced from the head of
the Mary River to a station about seventy miles farther inland. So far as
their limited numbers permitted, the settlers were assiduous in the dis-
covery and use of such facilities as by degrees opened upon them, and the
condition of the district seems to have been, if not violently prosperous,
at least progressive. Gradually it was provided with the usual means for
the administration of the law. A Court of Petty Sessions was established
at Brisbane, on March 1, 1817, and another at Ipswich, on July 5.
Messrs. M'Connell’s station, at Cressbrook ; Cambooya, on the Darling
Downs ; and Canning Downs (near Warwick) had been appointed places
for the same purpose, early in the year ; but Cressbrook was soon aban-
doned. The Government of New South Wales dealt rather harshly with
the residents in closing the old hospital, but an arrangement was soon
come to by which the public subscriptions were to be supplemented by an
annual grant from the revenue, and the buildings, now swept away for
the new Law Courts, were granted as a hospital for the settlement. The
provision of a decorous building for a church was also attended to, a visit
from the Anglican Bishop of the diocese —then that of Newcastle, New
South Wales—materially assisting in the work. The site now occupied
by St. John’s, Brisbane, was scoured, and plans obtained by which what
now partially forms the south side of the present building was afterwards
erected. There was a slight agitation about the best locality for the per-
manent capital, some turning their faces towards Cleveland, some suggest-
ing the present site of Maryborough ; and there were the usual local and
potty jealousies inseparable from small communities. It was seldom that
any great crime startled them from the generally quiet, though somewhat
jovial tenor of their way ; and the conduct of the people seems to have
been at least as good as that of their elder neighbours. I should almost
feel justified in considering it better, could I give the weight which may,
nevertheless, bo due to the testimony of Mr. Arthur Hodgson, then, as
now, a large run-holder on the Darling Downs, in behalf of the settlers in
the outlying districts, not usually considered the most straight-laced in


their behaviour. When on a visit to England in 1848, he informed a
meeting, held at the Shire Hall, Stafford, that—
“ his experience led him to declare, that what was said respecting the vice
and immorality which were represented as taking place there, was very
incorrect. He assured them that he knew no well-conducted establish-
ment where the master did not every Sunday assemble together his ser-
vants and rend prayers to them, and also, in some instances, a sermon.
Tliis was done in every well-regulated establishment in the colony ; and
besides, that he had frequently seen men congregated under a gum tree,
listening to the words of everlasting life.”
Mr. Hodgson spoke from personal observation, and I am therefore
compelled to believe that well-regulated establishments of the kind he
described were not numerous, and that such gum trees, like the poppies in
the old song, were rare,* although he might frequently have seen the few
that did exist.
•Poppies like these, I own, are rare ;
But nightingales’ songs like bis, beware.

In tracing the history of the successive efforts at shaping a new constitu-
tion for the Australian Colonics, it is necessary to turn back to Karl Grey’s
despatch of July, 1847, which I have before mentioned. The scheme it
embodied had at least the merit of consistency ; and, as a mere theoret-
ical effort, and considered without reference to the scanty and scattered
population of the country and its dissimilarity of character to that of the
older communities for which the system was suggested might have been
suitable, had much to recommend it. His lordship proposed, in the first
place, that the Legislatures should consist of two Chambers—one elective,
the other of nominees of the Crown. In the next place, he recommended
the establishment of district Councils, observing that 11 evils of a very
serious kind result from committing the inclusive management of the
affairs, both general and local, of a whole province to a central legisla-
ture, unaided and unbalanced by any description of local organization.”
And he then propounds the question, whether these councils might not
“ be made to bear to the House of Assembly—the relation of constituents
and representatives.” Not the least important proposition, was that of
devising a method for “ enabling the various Legislatures of the several
Australian Colonies to co-operate with each other in the enactment of
such laws as may he necessary for regulating the interests common to
their possessions collectively,” as, for instance, customs duties, postal pro-
cedure, roads, railways, and analogous matters.
It will be obvious that much of the value of the bi-cameral arrange-
ment, and all of its acceptance with the people to he governed, would de-
pend upon the conditions attached to the exercise of the nominatory


power on which the second chamber was to be constituted ; and as to
these nothing was indicated. Again, it is by no means clear that such
district councils as could have been obtained in New South Wales at that
time, or could be now in Australia, would afford constituent bodies in any
wise more qualified to select representatives than the general electorates
in the ordinary maimer. It is even very questionable whether the very
different character of the duties to be performed by the two bodies would
not so dissimilarize the qualifications of the members as to impair, if not
prevent, that sort of transitional and gradual exaltation, a notion of
which seemed to -be floating in Earl Grey’s mind. The worm—the grub
—the butterfly—are pretty as illustrations ; but, in tiro working of Gov-
ernments, the supposedly analogous human subject docs not always oc-
cupy the analogous situation. As to the federal suggestion made by his
lordship, it is greatly to be regretted that his firmness in persevering in a
provision for that was not equal to the foresight which dictated so wise a
suggestion.
The reception with which the despatch met was by no means encour-
aging. The proposal for district councils was encounterrd by a storm of
opposition from all parties. Tiie country residents objected that they had
not leisure to spend the time away from their homes that would be re-
quired for conciliar duties, or means to afford the expense’of attendance.
The members of the Legislature would have found their powers shorn in
the most vital point to them—their use in the gratification of local wishes
and the corresponding maintenance of political position. And these feel-
ings soon found expression. The Legislative Council of the colony met
on March 21, when the Governor laid before them a despatch from Earl
Grey, stating the terms on which the Home Government would send out
“ exiles and tioket-of-leave holders, to be subsequently followed by their
wives and families, and by a number of free immigrants equal to the num-
ber of such exiles and ticket-of-leave holders at the expense of the British
Government.” The other despatch to which I have just referred, and
which had been “published for general information,” was also commended
to their attention. On April 6, Mr. Wentworth moved the co-operation of
the Council with the Home Government, in carrying out Earl Grey’s emi-
gration scheme, which was carried after a warm debate. On May 9, the
same gentleman moved a series of resolutions condemnatory in almost
violent terms of Earl Grey’s proposal as to the form of the new constitu-
tion, but did not succeed in carrying them ; the Council, on the sugges-
tion of Mr. Charles Cowper—long a leading politician in Hew South
Wales —determining to frame reso u ions for themselves. When the time
came for this, an animated discussion took place, when at length Mr.
Wentworth moved, that the further consideration of the matter be post


ponod to that day six months, which motion was characteristically enough
carried, and, for the time, the subject dropped.
There was, indeed, little opportunity for its renewal, except as a hus-
tings topic. On June 21, the Council expired by effluxion of time, and
the elections once more occupied the attention of the district. On that
point all that need be said, is, that on Mr. M'Leay’s resignation, from con-
tinued ill health, Colonel Snodgrass and Mr. A. Boyd contested the seat.
The total number of electors for the three counties (Gloucester, Stanley,
and Macquarie) constituting the electora 4 ". was 301, of whom Brisbane
contributed 83, and Ipswich 21. The local journal was complacent on the
increased electoral importance of the district, which was not sufficient,
however, to induce a visit from the candidates, of whom Colonel Snod-
grass was elected on August 22.
The district itself continued to advance quietly but steadily, and, as a
sign of the times, I may note, that at the commencement of 1818, the
Courier had been enlarged to meet the public and advertising require-
ments of the improved order of things. In July, of the same year, the
proprietorship passed from Mr. Lyon to Mr. Swan, and thereupon a
change in the politics of the paper became every day more marked.
From a mild advocacy of the exiles, it gradually altered to a very warm
opposition of their introduction, and thus kept pace with the growing
changes around it. And the old Anglo-Saxon tendency to association be-
gan to display itself amongst the people. The first Oddfellows’ lodge was
established in Brisbane on December 8, 1817, to be, in due time, followed
by a temperance society, inaugurated at a public meeting hold in May,
1819. Ever and anon, too, the necessity for a bank crops up in the reports
of the times. On July 8, 1818, the inhabitants of the settlement memori-
alised the directors of the Union Bank of Australia, asking them to estab-
lish a branch in this “ rapidly increasing town and district.” Their state-
ments in support possess an historic value in the history of the settlement,
and I, therefore, quote some of them. They affirmed that the value of the
exports for the year 1817, was £72,297, and that for the current year,
they estimated the amount at £IOO,OOO. “ The live stoek on which our
prosperity at present principally relies, consisted, on January 1, ISIB, of
698,938 sheep, 18,257 cattle, and 2,189 horses.” It is worth noting, that
they suggest that the growth of cotton “ would give an immense impetus
to trade,” in which, however, they were mistaken, and they were pathetic
upon the distance all had to travel who had hanking business to transact,
and the inconvenience they sustained by their lengthened journey. But
the memorialists addressed a board which seems fully to have realised
Lord Stowell’s description of such bodies they never received the
courtesy of an acknowledgment of their application. The want of roads


and bridges seems to have excited a sort of spasmodic attempt at improve-
ment in the means of transit, for I find a transit company announced,
and much interest evinced in some plans for the construction of cheap
bridges, apparently on the lattice principle, which, however, resulted in
nothing practical. The scarcity of labour was also a sore trouble. Wages,
indeed, seem to have been moderate, reckoning by present standards.
Married couples received £3O a year and double rations, single men £2O
and single rations ; the wages of a domestic servant were £l4 a year ;
shearers fared better in the season, 2s. 9d. per score, or £3 3s. per week
being the current quotation. The absolute absence rather than the price
of labour seems to have been the great cause of complaint; squatters,
“ magistrates withal,” as the notice of the occurrence complains, having
occasionally to drive their own bullock-teams. It may easily be con-
ceived, therefore, that the arrival of fifty-six Chinese immigrants did not
much mend the state of affairs ; but that of the Artemetia, in December,
1848, with 240 male and female immigrants, gave the inhabitants soke
satisfaction. “ The arrival of the first immigrant vessel direct from Eng-
land, is an im lortant event in the annals of Moretou Bay,” observes the
Courier of that date ; “an epoch to be often reverted to by the future
historians of the northern colony.” I therefore note the fact with a good
grace encouraged by such a prediction.
In other respects the colonists were tolerably active in the advance-
ment of the district. An application was made to the central govern-
ment, that Brisbane might be declared a free warehousing port, which
received scant courtesy at the hands of the Colonial Secretary, and a per-
emptory refusal. Nothing daunted, the petitioners went to the Home Gov-
ernment, and, as a result, obtained a concession that the town should he
made a warehousing, in distinction from a free warehousing, port. They
followed this up by petitioning for the erection of a building for a Cus-
tom House, and in this, after an acrimonious dispute with the local
authorities as to the best site, they were successful. The melancholy con-
dition of the old Government garden—described as fast sinking into
dilapidation and ruin—was a reflection upon the economy and taste of
the New South Wales authorities, who would neither preserve it them-
selves—although the collection of plants is said to have been valuable—•
nor allow anyone else to preserve it for them. But the Roman Catholic
body contributed a valuable addition to the attractions of the place in a
church, small in dimensions, but marked by character and spirit of style,
whose loss a later structure of infinitely more ambitious pretension will
not prevent the architectural connoisseur from regretting. In the interior
the progress of building foreshadowed the townships of Drayton and War-
wick, and Mr. Bailee, making a successful journey to the Fitzroy Downs,


found them, in his opinion, to justify Sir Thomas Mitchell's description,
and reported accordingly. But the little growing settlement had its dis-
couragements. A heavy fall in the price of wool “ created in the large
pastoral districts a death-like depression, and public opinion—flying, as
usual, from one extreme to the oilier —already predicts the annihilation of
the squatting interest.” Over production was assigned by some as the
cause of the fall, but more accurate observers traced it to the commercial
depression in the old world, following upon the political disquietude of
the times ; and the squatters and their supporters took courage—perhaps
because it was useless doing otherwise. The blacks added to the vexation
of their souls, almost every number of the Courier containing some ac-
count of predatory aboriginal attacks. These, as a matter of course, were
met by such retaliation ns was possible. The whole squatting frontier be-
came a line of perpetual conflict, in which it is to be feared no small
cruelty was exercised on both sides. Why the hostile feelings, which found
vcftt in such barbarities, should have been caused, is a question involving
no, great profundity of speculation. There is a selfishness in civilization
as in savagery ; each grasping enough in its own development, and certain
to become bitter when the two are opposed —opposite as are their special
wants, natures, and perceptions. I know of no better explanation of the
foundation of such hostility than was given many years ago by a South
Australian native, when asked why he killed the settlers’ sheep—“ White
fellow kill black fellows’ kangaroo ; all same blaek fellow kill white fel-
lows’ kangaroo.” The justification to his mind at least was complete.
The social difficulties of the residen ts were not altogether confined to
the troubles arising from the natives. They had some experience of the
conduct of the “ exiles,” who were the objects of Earl Grey’s commisera-
tory sympathy, and thoroughly apprehended what might be the conse-
quences of that increased immigration with which they were threatened.
They therefore petitioned for the return of military protection, in which
they were successful. On November 13, a detachment of the 11th regi-
ment arrived, and took up their quarters in the old barracks, much to the
content of the people. The next object of their request, was the appoint-
ment of a resident judge, or at least the establishment of a circuit of the
Supreme Court. For this, however, they had yet to wait, and to endure the
miscarriage or prevention of justice, which the reference to Sydney of all
cases for trial could not but involve. In one respect they were not for-
gotten —a remembrance which, I suspect, the realisation of revenue had as
much to do with as any higher motive. The extension of squatting occu-
pancy rendered the subdivision of old, and the proclamation of new, pas-
toral districts necessary ; and in November, 1818, those of Moreton, Darl-
ing Downs, 0 wydir. Wide Bay, Burnett, and Maranoa, were proclaimed


accordingly; the late President of our Queensland Legislative Council, Sir
M. C. O’Connell, being appointed commissioner for the Barnett District.
The probability of a township at Maryborough was spoken of, although
influenced, it is said, by evil reports, there was a disinclination on the
part of new arrivals to take employment in the district, with which, more-
over, communication seems to have been of a very irregular kind. Early
in the following year, a post office was established at the locality of the
proposed town, the mails being carried by sailing vessel as opportunity
offered.
The first number of the Courier in the year 1819, startled the qui-
etude of what seemed to be sinking into a sort of sleepy-hollow, -with the
news of the Californian gold discoveries. They were received, at first,
with a quiescent incredulity, which, by and by, changed into an active
desire, on the part of some of the more adventurous spirits, to try their
chance in the varying fortunes of a miner’s life ; but although, from time
to time, the residents were amused or excited by the continuous reports of
increasing yields, I find the influence exerted upon the district was com-
paratively small.
What was of far greater moment to the people of Moreton Bay, was
the commencement and partial success of a scheme for comprehensive
and systematic immigration, of which the late Rev. John Dunmore Lang
was the author. That exceedingly energetic man had long before this
time exerted himself very efficiently in the promotion of free, as distin-
guished from convict, colonization; and, in pursuing that course, had
brought himself into ill-favour, not only with a large class in the colony
whose feelings and prejudices were offended by hostility always open and
exasperating, but with the Colonial Office in England, and with the New
.South Wales officials, who, with more or less feebleness, reflected the
opinions and endeavoured to serve the wishes of their employers. He
had, to a great extent, identified himself with the public and social pro-
gress of the colony, and I remember very well the influence his “ History
of New South Wales”* exercised on its first publication on the commer-
cial and emigrating public in the old country at a time when a great deal
had been written upon, and something done in the -way of colonization,
and the merits of rival systems were discussed, sometimes with more
temper than philosophy. I do not think it too much to say, speaking
from my own recollection, that the exertions of Dr. Lang, at that time,
in great measure, popularised the Eastern colonies of Australia with the
British public. It sometimes belongs to men of great energy to misdirect
it—of groat determination of purpose to mistake the motives and under-

rate the integrity of their opponents. And the greater their appreciation
of their object, the more impatient will they be of opposition, and intol-
erant of those by whom they are opposed. Any man of such qualities
living and acting in the early times of these colonies, would, no doubt,
find full exercise for their most extreme development. And I am not
at all surprised, that in the eyes of those who profited, or wished to profit,
by such a state of things as seems to have existed during many years
prior to the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales, Dr. Lang
was a very unpopular man.
And there were other antagonistic influences exerted by Dr. Lang's
public career. He had visited this district in 1815, and had then formed
a high opinion of its capabilities—so high as to ir ’ ’cc 1 "m to consider
that it would soon be as desirable to separate it from the parent colony as
the district of Port Phillip ; and he threw himself with characteristic
energy into the advocacy of separation for both. This did not increase
his popularity with the leading residents of New South Wales, but, on the
contrary, added new intensity to their dislike. It appears to me, that he
practically undervalued the effect all this might have upon his emigration
schemes, and thus became involved in responsibilities, and exposed to
insinuations, against which a more accurate estimate of the forces he had
to contend with, and a consequently more cautious procedure on his own
part, might have protected him ; a judgment, however, which those who
benefited in no small degree by an opposite line of conduct, can have no
right to pronounce. But what was more unfortunate still, was the abso-
lute intolerance and injustice which he at all times displayed, not only
towards all ecclesiastical systems which differed from what might be his
ideal at the time, but towards every person who could be supposed to be
identified with them, or who refused to admit the value of his own. He
did not scruple to denonnee, with all the vigour of an infallible controver-
sialist, Homan Catholicism as “ the Beast” of prophecy, and what would
now he regarded as a moderate high churchman, as “ the image of the
Beastthe Wesleyan as lukewarm ; and, almost as vigorously, the
members of the elder Presbyterian body to which he once belonged, as
“ Erastians.” And he carried into these disputes, and, in his later years,
into too many of his political contests, an amount of personal vitupera-
tion, of insinuation as to motive, and suspicion as to dealing, which are
hardly to be accounted for on any possible hypothesis; except, that in
all his plans he could bear,
Like the Grand Turk, no rival near his throne.
Public men of integrity of purpose, equal to any that he could claim
for himself, found themselves assailed with all the weapons employed


against the most abandoned “ emancipist ” of ancient times, and with
equal bitterness, until at last it almost seemed that an Anglican Bishop
and a convict editor stood on the same level in his estimation. Un-
happily, this grew upon him with time —as, when we compare his latest
published works with the first history to which I have alluded, becomes
painfully apparent. Undoubtedly, his influence on colonial progress was
great—his exertions, such as no man without great force of character and
strength of constitution, could have been equal to ; but the effect would
have been far greater had he admitted the rights of others to form and act
upon their opinions, and not always declined any estimate but his own.
Different systems of emigration had been tried previously to this ex-
periment. For a time the New South Wales Government adopted one of
bounties —so much per adult for the immigrants imported—a plan which
naturally led to great abuses in the efforts of holders of bounty orders—
i.e., orders for the introduction of a given number of immigrants—to sell
them to advantage, and of shippers, to recoup themselves by abridging as
far as they could, the convenience and comfort of their passengers. Then
the proceeds of the land sales were applied, sometimes directly, and some-
times in anticipation, by way of mortgage raised on the security of the
land fund, for the payment of passages. And, in aid of either, the Home
Government occasionally paid the cost of chartering vessels, and of pro-
visions and other necessary equipment from the English Treasury. In
addition to this, intending purchasers of colonial laud acquired by a de-
posit of their money with the home authorities, a right to nominate emi-
grants for free passages in the Government vessels, at the rate of one adult
or two children for every £2O so deposited. But in every case the ap-
proval of the emigrants and of the arrangements connected with their
voyage, was subject to the control of a board, called the Land and Emi-
gration Commissioners, sitting in London, whose notions of the actual
wants and wishes of the colonists seem to have been not infrequently
of a vague and shadowy nature.
At this time various efforts had been made to test the suitability of
the soil and climate of Moreton Bay to the growth of cotton. Small
samples submitted to Manchester manufacturers had obtained their ap-
proval, and it seemed probable, that could the plant be cultivated econ-
omically and profitably, there was an opening for a large trade, and for
the settlement of a considerable and prosperous population. Dr. Lang
was persuaded, or persuaded himself, that it could, and his enthusiasm
was fired by the prospect. He thought that he sarv the starving poor and
anxious middle classes of the old country brought into remunerative com-
petition with the slave holding cotton growers of the Southern United
States, and a doubly philanthropic purpose carried out, not only without


drawing upon, but in reality to the great assistance of, British commercial
and manufacturing industry. We may assume that he was in error, but
at that time, and afterwards, until experience supplied a refutation, the
great majority of our people were of the like opinion. Estimates showing
a more than average profit were given to him, and well-informed men of
sanguine temperament vouched their correctness. To create a new indus-
try, to form a new colony, to deal to slavery no slight blow, and to relieve
his fellow-countrymen from poverty and suifering, were, singly, objects
worthy of all the energy that could be thrown into the support of their
combination, and assuredly, in the doctor’s case, that energy was in nowise
spared.
Dr. Lang, after his visit to the district in 1845, left New South Wales
for England in the following year, and arrived there in December, when
he immediately commenced w r hat may be termed an emigration crusade ;
lecturing, writing in the public journals, corresponding and employing all
the means that an enthusiast would be most likely to adopt in furtherance
of his objects. After some time thus occupied, he attempted the forma-
tion of a company, called the “ Cooksland Colonization Company,”* and
while engaged in that, applied to the Colonial Office for free passages for
one hundred emigrants, to be selected by himself at Glasgow, and to be,
employed in the cultivation of cotton in Moreton Bay. On November 2,
1847, a reply to the application -was given, to the effect, that—
“ if an association shall be actually formed for trying the cultivation of
cotton, and should agree to purchase land belonging to the Crown on such
terms as would be compatible with the existing law on the subject, there
would be every disposition on the part of Her Majesty’s Government to
meet the association in the selection and despatch of emigrants to that
land, but that Earl Grey could not begin by promising to send out the
people, leaving it to be afterwards settled whether the body upon whom
they were to be dependent, would be organised and would acquire the
land upon which they were to be employed.”
He lost no time in answering this by a long letter, dated three days
afterwards, in which he asked that the proposed association should be en-
■ titled to lease land, with liberty to select and purchase at the upset price,
such as might be found most suitable for their purposes ; the cost of car-
rying out the experiment, as well as the purchase money of the land
bought, being allowed by the Government to go against the passages of
the immigrants. To this proposal a flat negative was given by Mr. Hawes,
the Under-Secretary for the Colonies. He persevered, however, in his
* Dr. Lang had previously published a volume, entitled “ Cooksland,” descriptive of
the district.


efforts for the formation of a company, and for an arrangement with the
Government, finding, as I infer, from a diligent perusal of the papers be-
fore m ', great difficulty in providing such a return as would give a com-
mercial profit to shareholders, and yet keep within the limits imposed
by the Imperial and Local Acts and Regulations touching the sale of
Crown hinds, and the selection and passage of emigrants. His first efforts
at the formation of a company, met with many obstructions, and were
finally abortive, in the face of the difficulty I have referred to ; but he
nevertheless persevered, and chartered the Fortitude, ship, for the convey-
ance of passengers to Moreton Bay, committing most of the business ar-
rangements to Mr. Arnold, a well-known and respectable London ship
broker. In his own letters, and in his evidence before a Select Committee
of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, in 1860, he states that, prior to
the departure of the vessel, in September, 1840, he had a personal inter-
view with Mr. Hawes, then Under-Secretary for the Colonies, and received
from that gentleman, if not an assurance, at least what amounted to
almost as much, that the local government would allow to immigrants
sent out by him a quantity of land equal, in proportion, to that made in
the case of those sent out by purchasers under the Land and Emigration
Commissioners. Mr. Hawes did not, when called upon, recollect any con-
versation of the kind. These facts, however, are certain ; Dr. Lang
undertook the personal responsibility of sending out the emigrants, and
was a heavy loser by the transaction ; and he gave to them land orders at
the rate of £lO for every £2O received from them, which orders he had no
official authority—no authority that he could make legally available—to
give. But lam unable to come to any other conclusion, than that he
fully believed those orders would be duly honoured by the local govern-
ment, unless 1 assume him to be something akin to an idiot; for it is in
the evidence of some of the most respectable of the passengers themselves
that in not a few cases only a portion—sometimes half, or not so much
—of the passage-money was paid to him or to his agent. He himself as-
serts that his loss by the Fortitude was £1,300, most of which ho had
paid in London before his return. It is admitted now, on all sides, that
he took great pains to promote both the physical and moral welfare of the
emigrants while on board. One witness, before the committee I have
mentioned, declared the accommodation in the Fortitude to have been
quite equal to that given to what were termed intermediate passengers,
the ordinary charge to whom at the time was £35 ; and I am unable to
find any trace of complaint touching the vessel, or the provisions, or any
other matter incidental to the voyage, Nor is there, in the local records
of those days, anything that can he construed into a charge of wilful
deception made by a single peason who came out by the first vessel.


But when the Fortitude arrived in Moreton Bay, on January 20,
184!), the people on board found that no local preparation had been made
to receive them, and that the gentleman to whom the vessel had been sent,
repudiated the agency. The local authorities had received no warning, and
the local newspaper complained that no previous notification of the pre-
cise nature of Dr. Lang's plans had been forwarded, or of the time when
the first arrivals might be expected, and that he had committed the local
charge of the whole matter “ to a gentleman whom ho had never consulted
on the subject, who had never received, we believe, a line from the doctor
since he left the colony and it trusted that ho would be able to exon-
crate himself from the charge of indiscretion which it considered, under
the circumstances, attached to him. The local authorities acted with
promptitude and consideration, in which they were well seconded by
the residents. On examination by the health officer, it was found that
two cases of fever had occurred within one month of the arrival of the
vessel, and she was placed in quarantine. The sickness could not have
been formidable, for, in a week the removal of the passengers to Brisbane
was ordered by the Police Magistrate. It does not appear, that on their
arrival, they suffered any unexpected inconvenience. ‘‘ We gather from
the statements made, that no expectations wore raised of an immediate
possession of land, and that the passengers were fully aware that they
must shift for themselves for the present.” I quote from the J do reton
Bay Courier of February 19, 1819, from which I also gather that the cha-
racter and conduct of the immigrants and their value to the district were
fully appreciated by the residents, who were not slow to express their
satisfaction ; while the immigrants, in their turn, seemed quite content
with the prospects before them.
Dr. Lang had sent out by the vessel a statement of claims on behalf
of the immigrants, and on his own account, which was forwarded to Syd-
ney, and in the meantime, the new settlers were provided with accommo-
dation in various ways. In a very short time almost all were engaged in
business or in service, a few remaining to sec when the promised land
would be allotted to them, and they might commence their proposed agri-
cultural pursuits. But in this their expectations were vain. The New-
South Wales Government gave prompt orders for the removal of such of
them as remained on the Crown lands they had been permitted to occupy,
and the right to obtain land at all was peremptorily repudiated. In fact,
the immigrants were most unjustly made to feel the consequences of the
almost vindictive animosity which Dr. Lang had excited in the minds of
Lari Grey and the then Governor, Sir Charles Fitzroy ; and 1 regret to be
compelled to say, that the official correspondence connected with this im-
migration scheme, was not in any way creditable to the writers. For in-

stance, in his statement of the circumstances attendant upon the arrival
of the Fortitude , Sir Charles brought out the fact, that the vessel had
been placed in quarantine ; but he did not say, that within one week from
the time this was done, the passengers were declared fit to be removed to
Brisbane. Earl Grey caught with alacrity at the insinuated mischief,
and, answering Sir Charles’s letter, observes, “ that they (the immigrants)
arrived with fever prevailing in their ships, and that there had been
several deaths on hoard. I cannot but fear,” he sympathetically adds,
“ that this has arisen from the imperfect arrangements which had been
made for the health and comfort of the passengers, as such an occurrence
is so exceedingly rare in Australian emigration when properly conducted
under the superintendence of the commissioners.” The total number of
deaths on board the Fortitude in a voyage of 123 days, were eight out of
two hundred and fifty-six—three adults and five children, and only a
single death from fever is stated to have occurred in the bay. It proved
an odd commentary on the Earl’s eulogium on the commissioners, that
in the Courier of August 10, 1850, in which his despatch was published,
the arrival of the first emigrant vessel, afterwards sent under their
auspices to the district, was announced with this addendum ;—“ We be-
lieve that there were seventeen deaths on the passage from typhus fever ;
that fifteen of the immigrants were reported sick ; and that a death oc-
curred yesterday.” Fourteen days afterwards, the vessel having been
placed in quarantine, the surgeon’s report was : —Sick, 56 ; convalescent,
63 ; and, ultimately, the number of deaths reached 40. I find no trace of
official sympathy for the sufferers on this occasion ; and not a word of re-
buke to the commissioners or their agents. Earl Grey’s animus towards
the doctor was somewhat unworthily exhibited by what was practically a
recommendation to Sir Charles, to encourage any disappointed immigrant
to commence a criminal prosecution against him. '
Scarcely had the Fortitude emigrants got settled in their places when
the Chately , bringing, in all, 225 passengers, arrived in the bay. The
same negligence had been shown, and the same taking for granted that
what was necessary would be done without preparation, just as if every
possible precaution had been taken to secure it—as had characterised the
want of arrangement in the case of the Fortitude. The passengers, there-
fore, had to pay for their own conveyance from the bay to Brisbane. The
Government gave them no welcome beyond a temporary accommodation
in the empty barracks, and what else they required they had to find for
themselves ; but no sickness occurred on this occasion to excite the
humane suspicions of either Colonial or Imperial officials. The doctor for-
warded a characteristic letter with the Chasely, addressed through the
Courier to the inhabitants of Moreton Bay. Reverting to the Fortitude


immigrants, he expresses misgivings as to their obtaining their lands, but
as to those by the Chasely, he explicitly states :
“ I have succeeded,'' however, in making such an arrangement with
the authorities here as will leave no uncertainty in regard to the acquisi-
tion of land for the immigrants per the Chasely, as was unavoidable in
the case of the Fortitude. We have already deposited a certain amount
in the Bank of England to the credit of the Commissioners of Land and
Emigration for the purchase of land in the colony for those emigrants ;
and we expect to deposit so much more as will be necessary when the
decision of the Commissioners upon the emigrants by that vessel generally
will be given. They were only examined this day (December 22) by
Lieutenant Lean, on account of the Commissioners ; and the result of
that examination will be known in a few days. It will be transmitted by
the mail packet to the local government at Sydney, and the matter will
only be subject to the delays arising from the official routine in regard to
land.”
Lieutenant Lean expressed himself on hoard as highly satisfied with
all he saw ; and, on turning to the Commissioner’s memorandum to Earl
Grey, of November 30, 1819, I find that £SOO was deposited on account
of the Chasely with them. The Chasely left the Downs on December 27.,
1818’; and, as it was not till June, 1319, that they informed Dr. Lang that
they would in future pass no emigrants for whom the deposit had not been
prev lously paid, I infer that in the case of that vessel this prudent condi-
tion had not been enforced. It would follow, then, that the non-comple-
tion of the deposit was the cause of the non-availability of the promised
land.
An explanation of this, satisfactory or not, may be supplied from the
obstacles found in the way of establishing the proposed Cookslaud Coloni-
zation Company. As far as I can gather from the published correspon-
dence, that company was left by Dr. Lang, as stated by him, on some dis-
agreement as to the locality of the management, and the exact status of
the emigrants ; but undoubtedly the disputes with the Colonial Office
were not without effect. Another company was then initiated by him, of
which the prospectus is before me, to be called the Port Phillip and
Clarence River Colonization Company, and he signs the letter I have
quoted from as secretary pro tem. to it. But lam unable to trace it any
farther than a prospectus. No money seems to have been received on ac-
count of shares, and no payments made on account of the company.
Actually, the whole arrangements seem to have been directed by Dr.
Lang. His motive for associating the district of Port Phillip with his en-
terprise, I can readily understand ; that was a portion of Australia thee
popular in England, and the climate believed to be pleasant and healthy,
whereas Morel on Bay was generally looked upon as an almost tropical
country, not easily endurable from its heat, while its connection with the
H*


“exile” question, prejudiced it with the general public. To unite the two
in one enterprise, would, ot course, benefit that which was least known ;
but the reason for adopting the Clarence River as the conjunctive name,
is not so easily perceived. Be this as it may, I have no doubt that, with
his sanguine temperament, Dr. Lang assumed the company as certain to
be formed when he had drawn the prospectus, and the result was, that he
had to bear all the consequences that followed from acting on such an as-
sumption. The Chasely immigrants at all events got no land. Of the
appropriation of the deposit acknowledged by the Commissioners, I am
not aware.
A curious proof of the sanguine and impetuous nature of the man,
will he found in connection with the Chasely. A Mr. Bowden, who had
been a long time engaged in the management of sugar estates in Jamaica,
believed the cultivation of the cane to be practicable here. He agreed
with the doctor to come to the district in that vessel with the purpose of
forming a company for the growth of sugar, but being of limited means,
Dr. Lang guaranteed a promissory note he gave in payment for the pas-
sage of himself and his family. In the letter forwarded by the Chasely,
the doctor warmly urged upon the residents in Moreton Bay, the forma-
tion of a company, with a capital of £IO,OOO, in a thousand shares of £lO
each, to carry on the project. He suggested that Mr. Bowdens expenses
should be paid out of the first deposits, and that a call of £1 per share
would be sufficient for preliminary operations. He deprecated any appli-
cation for capital to New South Wales, and dilated upon the importance
of purely local control, and waved before the eyes of the prosaic workers
in the little settlement the glory of striking a blow at the slave-holders of
Brazil and the United States, by the establishment of the sugar industry
in Moreton Bay. The history of the attempt to form a company which
followed, will be given in its proper place. What is more pertinent to my
present purpose, is, that the doctor’s responsibility seems to have been en-
forced, while the planters of Australia remained yet in the imaginative
future, on which he loved to dwell.
Carrying on the history ot this scheme, I next come to the arrival of
the Lima, on November 3, 1819, bringing eighty-four passengers. In the
letters which accompanied her, Ur. Lang did not allude to either land
orders or emigration companies, but the passengers brought out with them
orders to the value of about £9OO, which were, with but a trifling excep-
tion, honoured. There was some imputation made against him from trans-
actions connected with the payment for the vessel, in which these orders
were used for a time, but, as it appears to. me, with but a very shadowy
foundation. With the Lima, the introduction of immigrants on the pro-
posed system, terminated here, and Dr. Lang found, in avocations involv


ing less personal risk and pecuniary responsibility, full employment for
tbe energy of which be had so superabundant a share.
His conduct in his colonization schemes, has been attacked and de-
fended with extraordinary virulence. A portion of the Legislative Coun-
cil of New South Wales censured him in strong terms ; hut, considering
the party asperities of that day, and the nature of the majority against
him, X attach little value to their condemnation. The constituency of
Sydney were as warm in their eulogy; and, for similar reasons, lam in-
clined to give only its due weight to that. Earl Grey and others in his
train, accused him of a greed of personal gain, and of a desire to aggran-
dise his friends by the proposed enterprise, but we must take the facts as
we find them. Had every emigrant paid the intended company in full, if
all the vessels employed had been as well fitted and found as the Fortitude
and Cliasdy, competent judges have deliberately affirmed, that the mar-
gin would have been very small. In the draft charter, which was drawn
up and submitted to the Board of Trade, the dividend was restricted to
ten per cent., a return which, looking at the rate of colonial interest, and
of dividends of colonial institutions, must be pronounced moderate. His
friends, therefore, were not to be enriched. But as an individual, in the
management of his immigration, he seems to have thrown profit and pru-
dence alike to the winds. The Courier of the day, gave as a fact, de-
rived from information supplied by the Fortitude immigrants themselves,
that more than £2,000 had been paid by them to him, and, considering
the source, we may suppose the amount was not understated. Equal to
two hundred and two adults came out in her, and at the lowest calculation
Ido not think £ls per head could be below the cost. If the doctor re-
ceived about £2,000, he would have been a heavy loser by that transac-
tion, a loss that would be increased by his giving credit for portions of
passage money to impecunious passengers. I see nothing extraordinary,
under such circumstances, in his sinking £1,30(f on the Fortitude, alone,
or losing £3,000 or £4,000 in the six ships sent by him to this district and
to Port Phillip. It is not denied that all his obligations in England aris-
ing from the expenses incurred with them were discharged, nor that some
who anticipated with eagerness a different conclusion, were not a little
astonished at such a result.
On the precise nature of the understanding between Dr. Lang and
the emigrants, as to the land orders, or their mu tual misapprehensions, I
presume not to judge. Both sides have made their own statement. Dr.
Lang, in a letter in the Melbourne Argus, of May 14, affirms substantially
that they had full value for their money in their passages, the land orders
being a guarantee that they should receive certain portions of land in ad-
dition ; and that they were told and knew that, although they might be


put in occupation of the land, no deeds would be granted until the pro-
posed company was fully formed, and a uniform system of allotment
established. That no land at all was obtained for some of them, he
blames the Colonial Office for. The immigrants, on the other hand, de-
clared that they paid this money for the purchase of land, and received a
“ right to nominate for free passages themselves and families, or other
eligible persons, in the proportion of one adult for every pound ex-
pended.”* However this might be, as to those who paid in full, it could
hardly apply to those who paid half, or less, or to those, who, with a wise
precaution, did, in their own language, “ advance deposits sufficient to
cover the cost of their respective passages out; the remainder being stipu-
lated to be paid on receiving the land for which they held an ordcr.”f
The reader, however, has both sides of the question. And there is one
remarkable fact, with the parties principally concerned—with the great
majority of the immigrants assumed to have been defrauded—Dr. Lang
undoubtedly maintained a good opinion and friendly relations.
The conduct of the Colonial Office is another matter. If its authori-
ties determined to adhere to their routine under any circumstances, they
were right in abiding by their decision ; but the wisdom of the decision
itself may well be open to question. The austere autocracy which could
listen to nothing that involved a chance of profit to associations engaged
in an enterprise that—-as experience of what was substantially the same
system has abundantly proved—must even, without the successful cultiva-
tion of cotton, have materially assisted the settlement and industry of the
colonies, and with them the trade of the mother country, melted into a
gushing compassion when it proposed to give to probationary “ exiles ” a
three years’ lease of land rent free, and, at the termination of that, a pre-
emptive right of purchase at the upset price. Dr. Lang asked for respect-
able industrious associations one year’s lease, to enable them to select and
settle their people, and was, in effect, told, by the peremptory refusal he
met with, that in the eyes of the Colonial Office of that day, the promo-
tion of free industry was of infinitely less importance than the reward of
a probation for which an opportunity had been made by previous crime.
If, in thus entering at length into the particulars of an immigration
which exerted a very marked influence upon the character and course of
the district, and of Dr. Lang’s connection with it, I appear to the reader
to have dwelt too minutely or too long upon the various points, I have
only to say, that in the space occupied is condensed the pith of a most

voluminous correspondence, of many debates, of reports, resolutions, pam-
phlets, leading articles, and every form of controversy, extending over
more than twelve years. And it was due to the memory of the eminent
man, now no more, whose character has been impugned, but whose ser-
vices to the colony of Queensland cannot be denied—if the value of inde-
pendent government, free from the convict taint which beset the parent
colony, be admitted—and were formally recognised by its first, and to
him, undoubtedly hostile Parliament—that his conduct should be placed
in as clear a light as it was in my power to throw upon it. Not less was
it due to the large body of our population who are connected directly or
indirectly, with the immigrants he was the means of introducing, whose
beneficial influence, at a critical time, upon the moral and social future of
the colony, is beyond dispute. lam neither his defender nor his apolo-
gist—dissent very strongly from many of his expressed opinions ; have no
sympathy with his prejudices, religious or political—and in his life time
had but the slightest possible communication with him : and in the course
of this inquiry, have been guided by published documentary evidence—ad-
mitted by all parties—bearing upon the case, and by that alone. If there
had been one reason wanting to induce me to enter upon it, I should have
found it in the fact, that at last his great age, not only left the services of
his vigorous manhood behind the recollection of the great majority of
those who are now engaged in the ever changing hurry of colonial life,
but enfeebled his own perceptions of self-respect, and called for an indul-
gence—not always extended to him—which the best of us may well pray
may never be required for ourselves. Few who saw him only in the late
years of his life, would have imagined him the competitor of Donaldson,
of Manning, of the towering and vehement Wentworth, of the acute and
brilliant Lowe. When we remember what he effected, and what he
underwent, something may be conceded even by enmity—something for-
given for what appears the pertinacity of an expiring egotism. Is it
wonderful, that when we persistently discharge our memories of the past
services of public men, they do now and then remember them : if the re-
minder sounds like a reproach, whose fault is it but our own 1
Whatever may have been the defects of Dr. Lang’s emigration
schemes, little was done to supplement his efforts or remedy their defects.
The total number of immigrants sent out by the Commissioners, and
landed in Brisbane, during the year 1819, was 101. In addition to these,
13 orphan girls, who formed part of a number shipped to Australia by a
philanthropic committee, and mostly, I believe, from Ireland, were for-
warded from Sydney. To counterbalance these, 306 prisoners were sent
to complete their term of punishment, or, as Lord Grey expressed it, of
probationary reform. It is not surprising that the free residents began to


agitate for the total cessation of transportation, even though, at the close
of the year, I find very bitter discontent expressed at the scarcity of
labour, and the consequent hindrance to the industries of the district.
That discontent was aggravated by the conduct of the Sydney Govern-
ment in doling out a miserable and fractional portion of the large immi-
gration to New South Wales since its resumption in 1818. From that
time to the middle of May, fifty-four ships, bringing out 13,G01 souls, had
arrived, and of the whole number this district appears to have received
only about 400.
That Earl Grey was resolutely bent on the continuance of Eastern
Australia as a reformatory colony in some shape or other, I gather from
his despatch of September 8, 1848 —published here in March, 1849—in
which he informed Sir Charles Fitzroy that the Order in Council, by
which New South Wales was made no longer a place for receiving con-
victs under sentence for transportation, would be revoked. As, he wrote,
it seemed improbable that funds would be available from the British
Treasury for the conveyance of a number of free immigrants, equal to
that of the male convicts, he requested the concurrence of the colonists to
the permanent establishment of the proposed system, irrespective of free
immigration ; believing that they “ would prefer, to the entire abandon-
ment of the measure proposed, receiving a moderate number of convicts
that there would be “no difficulty in disposing of all the convicts, for
whom it is necessary to provide and that it would be of so “ much ad-
vantage to the several British colonies, where there is a great demand for
labour, as to induce them gladly to receive all the convicts that can be sent
to them.” Having wrought up his convictions to that pitch, he concluded
the despatch by saying, that he should immediately commence carrying
out his plan, and continue to do so until he received an answer ; if that
were unfavourable, he should fall back upon the system of equal immi-
gration. The delusion under which he seems to have laboured, as to the
real feeling of the colonists, must have been soon dispelled. The inhabi-
tants of Port Phillip became so violent in their opposition, that the Go-
vernor was induced to promise, that all prison ships sent there, should be
ordered on to Sydney, at which the wrath of the Sydney population
blazed vehemently out. They were not soothed by Sir Charles Fitzroy’s
assurance, that should the Legislative Council decline to concur with Earl
Grey in the matter, the new scheme would be abandoned. A meeting of
upwards of 4,000 persons was held in Sydney, when a strong protest
against ’the renewal of transportation, supported by Mr. Kobert Lowe, was
carried unanimously, as well as resolutions requesting that the first con-
vict ship—the Haghemy, just arrived—should be at once sent back to
London at the Home Government’s expense.


The protest in due time bore fruit—the resolutions floated away,
The cargo of the Hashemy was discharged, and fifty-four of her convict
passengers were sent to Moreton Bay, where their arrival was acknow-
ledged by a petition to the Queen for the abolition of transportation. A
sort of giim merriment was caused by the mixture of economy and dis-
cipline exhibited by another despatch from the Secretary of State, in
which it was ordered that none of the ticket-of-leave holders should re-
ceive a conditional pardon, however apparently exemplary might be their
lives, unless they re-paid the cost of their involuntary passage, fixed at
£2O. And when, on November 1, the Mount Stuart Elphinstone arrived
with 225 male supposed candidates for their purchased pardons, there was
fresh food for cynicism furnished by a new regulation, that employers de-
sirous to get their services, should engage them on board, whereby the
Government saved the cost of passage from the bay, and of housing and
feeding them the day longer, which, placing them in barracks, would have
involved. Immediately upon the ship’s arrival being notified, a notice
was published, calling a meeting of the residents to consider “ the best
means of receiving exiles,” and to petition the Government to send out a
“ fair proportion of free immigrants but under this appeared another
advertisement, entreating the attendance of the inhabitants, that a full
expression of public opinion on the whole subject might be obtained. A
meeting was accordingly held in Brisbane on November 13, when a reso-
lution was proposed, preferring a request to the Home Government for
adequate military and police protection, as the district was to become a
convict colony, and for the “ fair ” proportion of free immigrants to be
sent as well. On this, an amendment was moved, embodying a protest
against the renewal of transportation in any form, and carried with
scarcely any dissent. The majority at once prepared for a larger and
more authoritative meeting, which was held four days afterwards —when
resolutions were unanimously carried objecting to transportation in any
form ; protesting against the unnecessary delays to which immigrants
were subjected in the acquisition of land, and against any scheme which
might tend to discourage the immigration of capital and labour. A me-
morial, in an argumentative form, embodying the resolutions, and, in
vigorous language, depicting the unvarying evil conduct of the recently-
arrived convicts, was adopted on the motion of Mr. Robert Little, a well-
known colonist of moderate views (who has been Crown Solicitor to this
colony ever since it became one), and directed to be forwarded to the
Home Government. The close of the year brought with it an intended
consolatory despatch from Earl Grey, to the effect that, in future, it was
the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to send out a number of free
immigrants equal to that of the male convicts shipped to the colony—but


the residents manifested little joy on this assurance, qualified as it was by
a notification, that the wives and families of the convicts would be
counted as part of the free emigration. The pro-transportation party,
however, mustered at Ipswich, as a meeting of squatters and other em-
ployers of labour —but resolutions submitted in favour of convict immi-
gration were decidedly rejected. Some of the leading proprietors of
stations on the Darling Downs, however, volunteered a solitary drop of
comfort to the Minister, and memorialised him for the importation of
“ exiles,” assuring him that from 1,000 to 1,500 could be absorbed ; “ and
by none more readily ” than the memorialists, said to be employers of
more than 500 men. They were especially severe upon the new arrivals
in Dr. Lang’s ships, who had, in reality, given life and strength to the op-
ponents of the system sought to be enforced.
The boon of Separation from New South Wales had, indeed, been in-
sinuated as a sort of sop for the conversion of the district into a penal
colony, or rather of a colony for the reception of persons supposed to have
reached the half-way house to reformation. It would be idle to attempt
to conceal that at first, to the established men of business and the large
employers of labour, the prospect had not its bright side. “ Highly re-
spectable individuals declare,” (said the Courier) “ that if Moreton Bay is
to be the capital of a colony, it is immaterial to consider the elements from
which the colony is to be formed ; and many persons maintain that some
of the first colonies have arisen from the seeds of criminal transportation.”
The tactics of the anti-transportationists, as we have seen, pledged the
district as such against the reception of convicts ; and, so far, a step was
gained to the promoters of a free, as distinguished from a semi-pcnal, in-
dependence. As to the extended constitution for New South Wales and
Victoria, nothing was done ; the bill introduced by Lord John Russell in
the House of Commons being postponed and ultimately abandoned. The
measure was based upon a Report from a Committee of the Privy Council
—an able and statesmanlike paper—whose recommendations, had they
been carried into effect, would have been of the very greatest benefit to
all Australia. The citation of some of them appears so apposite to the
discussions which are now every-day day matters with the self-elected
patrons of the colonies in the old country, and to the philosophic dis-
coveries of our own local world, that it would be inexcusable to omit the
reference.
In dealing with the functions proposed to be given to what may be
termed the Colonial Legislature, the suggestions as to their power of alter-
ing the local constitutions, or modifying the reserved monetary appropria-
tions, were precautionary and yet liberal ; but it was in consideration of
questions that might concern all the Australian colonies, that a wise and


legislative spirit was most displayed. After disposing of the minor sub-
jects, the report went on to deal with the possibility of different tariffs in
different colonies—a difference even then existing between South Austra-
lia and New South Wales —which, as the number of provinces increased,
might be supposed to multiply also ; and assuming that such would be
the case, it continues :
“ So great indeed would be the evil, and such the obstruction of the
intercolonial trade, and so great the check to the development of the re-
sources of each of these colonies, that it seems to us necessary that there
should be one tariff common to them all, so that goods might be carried
from the one into the other with the same absolute freedom as between
any two adjacent counties in England.”
Adopting the primary principle involved in this position, the com-
mittee recommended that one of the Australian governors should be con-
stituted Governor-General of Australia ; that he should have power to
convene a body, to be called the General Assembly of Australia, who
should be enabled to legislate in the matters thereafter enumerated, but
that the first meeting should not be convoked until at Ifeast two of the
Australian Legislatures had requested the Governor-General to exercise
his powers of convocation. The Assembly was to consist of delegates,
elected by the several Legislatures, and premising that the first tariff —an
uniform one—was to be fixed by the Imperial Parliament, it was to have
power to deal with—(l) the imputation of duties on imports and exports f
(2) postage ; (3) internal communication, roads, railways, etc. ; (I) coast
lights and beacons; (5) shipping and harbour dues; (6) the establish-
ment of a general Supreme Court, either as an original one or of appeal
from the courts of separate colonies ; (7) the determination of jurisdic-
tion and procedure in each Supreme Court; (8) weights and measures ;
(9) such other subjects as they might be asked to consider by address
from the Legislatures of separate colonies ; and (10) the appropriation,
by equal levy upon all the colonies, of the sums necessary to carry its en-
actments into effect. When Lord John Russell moved the second reading-
of the bill, he further proposed to leave to the Assembly the initiation of
the uniform tariff and —a point of equal importance—the regulation of the
price of Crown lands. It is exceedingly to be regretted, that any cause
should have operated to the abandonment of a scheme so comprehensive
in outline, and so just in its general principle. Yet, that regret may be
qualified by the reflection that, had it been adopted, what trickling rills
of wise suggestions would have been dried up ; what volumes of indignant
eloquence at their permitted sterility would have been neither spoken nor
thought of, A metropolis is the grave of small reputations—equally so is
retrospection the executioner of mediocre originality; and we need not.


therefore, feel so very much surprise that almost all the best points in
multitudinous later schemes for Customs unions, and federal association,
were anticipated more than a quarter of a century ago. More singular to
me is the mean and stunted dimensions into which —from what influence
I cannot learn—the effective measure for conferring constitutions on these
colonies ultimately shrunk.
The transition from tariffs to trade is natural. The first detailed table
of exports that I find, is on April 7, 1849, and it gives the values for the
six months ending March 31 of that year, as £53,480, of which all but
about £SOO worth, was pastoral produce. Among the smaller items was
210 tons of coal, value, £94 10s. For the three months ending June 30,
the total export was £32,651 ; for the next quarter, £14,284, and for the
last quarter of 1849, £34,888 the whole for fifteen months being
£140,103. The estimate of the applicants for a branch bank was more
than confirmed by the results of the year’s industry. The stock in the
district was estimated to have increased during the year 1848, by 1,069
horses, 27,768 cattle, and 410,874 sheep—cattle, 58 per cent., and sheep,
62. In other industries I am unable to find any success. Mr. Bowden’s
efforts at the establishment of a sugar company, met with a good deal of
expressed, but hardly the shadow of any practical, sympathy, although
the capital required was fixed at the modest sum of £3,000, to be sub-
scribed in two or three years ; and partial ordinary cultivation was pro-
mised to assure the shareholders from loss. On trying Sydney, he met
with a little better reception at first, but the ultimate result was the same,
and in his letter announcing his failure, he complained bitterly of the
apathy with which his exertions had been encountered. Some canes, ob-
tained at Tahiti, were distributed, but nothing practical followed from the
growth of the few planted. The cultivation of cotton was discussed with
some energy, and estimates were given of great profits to be realised, and
the readers having congratulated themselves on the promising aspect of
the industry, left others to realise it. A company for running steamboats
on the Brisbane was announced, and there seems to have died out; hut
the enterprise of two residents, Messrs. Reid and Boyland, was shown in
the employment of Mr. Winship in the construction of the Hawk, a
steamer of seventy tons burden, which ran for many years with varying
success. “Awfully short of cash,” according to the local journal, was the
great complaint. It is, therefore, creditable to the people that local sub-
scriptions were entered into for the building of a Presbyterian Church,
the Rev. C. Stewart, who had arrived in the Chasely, taking an active part
in promoting the design. The Brisbane School of Arts was also started on
September 24 of this year, and the first discussion opened on October 11,
following. There was much advance in interior settlement, as distin


guished from mere occupation. Although Drayton was proclaimed a
township in the same month, and vague rumours came of fine pastoral
country behind Port Curtis, wistful glances were now and then thrown to-'
wards the slopes of the Dividing Kange, and even northwards, where gold
was supposed to await the minor, hut no one seemed inclined to face the
dangers of the search. The fate of poor Kennedy had thrown great dis-
couragement on exploration.
Kennedy, who was an assistant surveyor under the New South Wales
Government, and, although a young man of moderate experience, had dis-
tinguished himself under Sir Thomas Mitchell, and, as we have seen in
verifying that officer’s discoveries, was landed at Eockingham Bay on
May 24, 1848, with instructions to penetrate thence to Albany Island, off
Cape York, where he was to he met by a schooner from Sydney, with sup-
plies. He was then to make his way back on the western side of the
peninsula, and return to Sydney. The probable obstacles seem to have
been overlooked, and some of the men sent with him—eleven, and an
aboriginal named “ Jaoky Jaoky ” —were utterly unfit for such an enter-
prise ; one was nearly an idiot, and another (the storekeeper), a vagabond
and a thief. The country was mountainous, and for tjre most part, covered
with dense scrub, and the blacks numerous and savage. Erom their start-
ing from the landing place, to November 10, they travelled painfully and
wearily over 450 miles of the country I have characterised, when they
reached the neighbourhood of Weymouth Bay, having been compelled to
leave their carts and a portion of their stores behind them. During the
whole of this journey they were harassed by the natives, and, towards its
end, suffered sorely from both hungc- and thirst, and yet were compelled
to cut great part of their way through dense scrubs. On reaching Wey-
mouth Bay (in latitude about 18° 40'), Kennedy determined to push on
the remaining 150 miles to Cape York with three men and the aboriginal,
leaving his second —Mr. Canon—with the remaining seven, to “ spell ” at
the camp. The miseries he endured on this journey, up to the time of his
death, were, as narrated by Jaoky Jaoky, extreme. About three weeks
after leaving Weymouth Bay, one of his party accidentally shot himself,
near Shelbourne Bay, and Kennedy decided to leave him with the other
two men, both in a state of considerable weakness, while he travelled, as
rapidly as over the remaining eighty or ninety miles to meet the
schooner, and bring her back to take them on hoard. He took Jaoky
Jacky with him. On the evening of the seventh day from leaving them,
and having reached a point near Escape Eiver, at which they could see
Albany, their destination, they were surrounded by natives, who had
tracked them on their journey. Kennedy, who was exhausted by hunger
and fatigue, had been left for a few seconds by Jaoky Jacky, who was in


tent on getting at the back of the tribe, to scare them with his gun, but,
before he could accomplish what he intended, the unfortunate explorer
•was pierced by three spears, and his watch and other articles taken from
him. Jacky cut out the weapons and carried him into the scrub, where,
faint and dying, he asked for paper and pencil that he might scrawl a few
lines to the captain of the schooner, and, in the effort to use them, fell
back into his companion’s arms and expired. Jacky Jacky stayed, stupi-
fied with grief, for about an hour, “ until I got well,” and then buried the
body, with the rude means he had—digging the earth with his toma-
hawk, and covering it with logs, his own shirt and trousers, and earth and
leaves. Then, starting in the dark, and often driven to conceal himself
in the creeks he waded along, he, after thirteen days, reached Albany in a
wretched plight, and was taken on board the Ariel, schooner, lying there
expecting the traveller. The schooner set sail for Shelbourne Bay, but on
arrival there, the seamen refused to attempt the rescue of the throe men
left ; little doubt, however, exists as to their fate, the blacks being seen
with part of their clothing. The trousers in which Jacky Jacky had
buried his master wore found in a canoe. The Ariel then went on to
Weymouth Bay, near where, after reaching the camp at the hazard of
their lives, Captain Dobson, Dr. Vallagh, a seaman named Barrett, and
Jacky Jacky, found Mr. Canon and one companion named Goddard, mere
skeletons, from starvation and anxiety, sole survivors of the party. The
rest had one by one sunk under their sufferings. All that was gained by
so much misery and sacrifice of life, was the confirmation of what had
been before supposed—the impracticable nature of the country, and a
verbose panegyric on the survivors in the Government Gazette. It is
questionable how much the passion for exploration may outrun necessity,
or a just regard for even common humanity, Leichhardt, Kennedy, Cun-
nigham, remind us of the cost of its indulgence.

I have bo lar endeavoured to narrate, with, perhaps, greater minuteness
than their apparent importance would demand, the incidents which may
be said to have decided for a long time the character o£ the district; but
because they did so decide it I was thus minute. What followed up to
the discovery of gold in Kew South Wales, and subsequently in Victoria,
was what might have been anticipated in the history of such a settleir. -it.
The immigration during the year 1850 was small. In January “ fifty
orphans and thirty other immigrants ” were sent from Sydney, and in
March ten more females. In August, the Emigrant, to which vessel I have
before referred, arrived direct from England, having on board, when she
left Plymouth, 272 souls, bringing with her typhus fever, of which sixty-
four cases had occurred since May 12. These are all of which I have
found record. It transpired, however, that some of the leading squatters
had not been idle, on a recent visit to London, in representing to the
Home. Government the difficulties which the want of labour interposed in
the way of industrial progress, and in strengthening Earl Grey’s hands by
applications for the shipment of “ exiles,” a course which, however dis-
tasteful it might have been to the majority in 1850, was certainly not at
variance with the current of public opinion as it ran in 1848. They and
their friends may therefore be supposed to have been not ungratified by
the arrival of the Bangalore, in May, with 292 convicts and 104 free men,
women, and children, including the guard of twenty-nine pensioners, thei?
wives and relatives, and some of those of previous probationers. Of the
reforming passengers, it is written “ with few exceptions there was much
les- snrrov and repentance for past offence? than tw met;- to seiav fntawe


opportunities of repeating them.” Forty-five were shipped to Wide Bay,
in nowise to their discontent, there being no constables there. Having
thus incurred the necessity for increased protection, the Secretary of State
directed the removal of the small military force then in the district, to
the great dissatisfaction of the residents, who memorialised the Few South
Wales Governmet against the step, but without effect. On the genen 1
question of transportation, resolutions condemnatory of the system were
carried in the Legislative Council, early in October, the then Attorney-
General—the late Mr. Plunkett—making a vigorous speech in their fa-
vour. Dr. Lang, who had returned to Few South Wales, and been elected
for Sydney, had the satisfaction of voting in the majority.
The Separation Question gradually strengthened, and began to occupy
the leading columns of the newspapers; and the intelligence, that a clause
had been embodied in the new Constitution Bill, authorising the Queen to
create a new colony northward of the 30th degree of south latitude, which
would have included the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district, served
to quicken the attention of the residents to the subject. At a meeting of
the [leading squatters, at Drayton, it was recommended, amongst other
things, that accounts of the revenue and expenditure in the district should
be moved for in the Legislative Council, and that an effort should be made
to secure direct shipment of produce to England, instead of by way of
Sydney. But when the resignation by Colonel Snodgrass of his scat in
the Legislative Council necessitated an eiectioa, there was little energy
displayed in the gloved contest that ensued. The one point looked to was
Separation, and as a means towards it, the securing a due share of repre-
sentation in any new Council when the electoral districts were extended.
Not one-third of the electors recorded their votes, but sufficient were
polled to return Mr. Robert Jones, a resident of Brisbane, in opposition
to Mr. Robert Campbell, of Sydney. While the election was still pend-
ing, a public meeting was held at Brisbane to adopt a petition to the
Queen, praying for Separation, at which it appeared plainly enough that,
however strongly the feeling in favour of that object might be, it was not
sufficiently so to induce any lasting compromise between the friends and
opponents of the reception of prisoners. The petition made ho reference
to that question, and was adopted by a large majority ; but both sides
were preparing for a vigorous struggle. Mr. Lyon, who had always de-
fended the introduction of “exiles” as necessary for the supply of labour,
had been assisted by the great employers, and those whom they could in-
fluence, to the establishment of a second newspaper to advocate their own
views, His connection with the Moreton Bay Free Press, as it was
called, seems to have been short, and a succession of editors followed one


another, equally zealous in the same cause.* The whole question was
soon debated with no small virulence, both by the journals and the two
sections into which the public were divided.
Along with this the probable form of the new Australian constitution
was discussed with some keenness. In opening the Legislative Council
on June 1, the Governor informed them, that it was the intention of the
Homo Government to press the proposed measure through Parliament ;
and a bill, based in great measure upon the report I have described in
the preceding chapter, was early in the session once more brought in by
Lord John Eussoll. In the course of its passage it suffered cruel curtail-
ment, and some able English statesmen protested energetically against
the emasculated product, Mr. Eoebuck deriving' consolation from the
“ hope, that when the bill arrived in the colony, it would create such a de-
gree of discontent, that Parliament would be obliged to reconsider the
whole subject ” —a hope in the nature of a prophecy, and one of which its
author soon saw the fulfilment.
The Act in its final shape provided for the separation of the district
of Port Phillip from New South Wales, and its erection into the colony of
Victoria. As respected New South Wales, it continued a Legislative
Council, one third being nominees of the Crown. It lowered the mini-
mum franchise, which had been the £2O householder, to one of £lO, and
extended the right of voting to the squatters (described by Lord John
Eussell as a wealthy and most respectable body) in virtue of their leases.
After provisions respecting the Australian Colonies generally, not neces-
sary to be here noticed, it conferred on the Legislature of New South
Wales the power of creating new electoral districts and increasing the
numbers of the members, providing, however, that the relative proportions
of nominated and elected members should be preserved. The Council
were to impose taxes, and direct appropriation, but a civil list of £72,000
was reserved from their control, and the management and sale of the
Crown lands, and their revenues were still retained by the Crown ; while
the provision for the payment of the police by assessment was abolished,
and the cost directed to be defrayed out of the general revenue. What was
* I may mention here, that the Free P/rss was continued up to the time of Separa-
tion, and during the period of its existence, is said to have displayed in its leading
columns, ability of no ordinary kind. At that time, I believe, Mr. Watts, afterwards for
some months editor of the Melbourne Aryus. was connected with the Press in a similar
capacity. I regret, that having made diligent search, I have not been able to find a
single copy of the Free Frees in the colony—a fact, however, not to be taken in derogation
of its value. Few colonial newspapers seem to be looked upon with any very affectionate
regard except by their own proprietors. I doubt if I should have been able to find a file of
the Courier , but for the conservative forethought of its first publisher, M>. Swan.
I VOL. I.


of infinitely greater importance, the Act left tlie construction of new con-
stitutions, whenever any of the colonies grew tired of that now given
them, with their own legislatures, subject to approval by the Imperial
Parliament ; and it provided, as I have said, for separation by the Queen
in Council, of any territory lying northward of the 30th degree of south
latitude from New South Wales, conditionally upon the petition for such
a severance from the resident householders of the territory. So far as it
went, it was a step in advance ; but in entrusting to each of the local
legislatures the power of forming a constitution for its own colony, it
afforded encouragement to that notion of diverse conditions and interests
which has worked so much mischief throughout Australia. Had the sug-
gestions of the committee of the Privy Council been carried out in their
entirety, there might at this day have been a united Australia, instead of
a collection of disputatious and jealous communities, with their different
tariffs, their conflicting legislation, and their apparent incapacity of act-
ing in concert for any purpose tending towards the common welfare.
Such as it was, however, it was to be acted upon. The principal anxiety
of the Moreton Bay people, was to secure a just proportion of power in the
new electoral distribution, and they awaited the meeting of the Legisla-
tive Council, by whom the adjustment was to be made, with some anxiety.
The Act did not arrive in time for the Council to carry out its provi-
sions during the year, but while it did sit some motions were adopted, in
which the district was more or less interested. In September, Mr. Donald-
son obtained a committee to inquire into the expediency of establishing
steam mail communication with Europe by way of Singapore, which, as I
find no further trace of it, must have lapsed by the prorogation. It is
worth noting, as showing how strongly the idea of northern colonization
and connection with the East was impressed upon the colonial mind before
the goldfields drove every other topic from public attention—an idea which
found ftrther expression in the confidence repeatedly shown in the an-
nexation and colonization of New Guinea. Some further matters, mostly
of temporary interest, were mooted by the same gentleman, who seems to
have acted for the then retiring local member, incapacitated by age and
infirmity, and some returns were obtained bearing upon the Separation
Question. The Moreton Bay people were very Sanguine as to the early
erection of the district into a separate colony, and began to dispute as to
whom the principal merit of bringing about such a consummation was
due, and as to the form it should assume. They did not imagine that they
would have nine years' delay in which they might have time to arrive at
conclusions on both points.
:.t Butin re thing the widen Is had ccsw&s •> • <vxQjti«*nt *lnf these


selves. On February 12, in tin's year, a notice appeared in the of
the establishment of a circuit of the Supreme Court for Moreton Bay ;
and on the 13th of the following May, it was opened by the late Mr. Jus-
tice Therry, in the chapel of the old convict barracks. There could have
been little of dignity in the room or its surroundings, but the judge ad-
dressed a preliminary charge which made a great impression at the time,
and was afterwards reprinted and published. Ho rapidly traced the pro-
gress of the district, and then went on to point out very lucidly, the princi-
ples which should guide jurors and witnesses in the discharge of their obli-
gations. One illustration which he gave of the evils that may follow from
the negligence or incapacity of a witness, appears worthy of preservation,
and I append it in a note.* And it is a fact, more suggestive than re-
markable, that after twenty-three years of experience in the criminal
practice of the Courts, he gave it as his deliberate judgment, that in the
* “ About the year 1835, when I happened to hold the office of Assistant Crown Pro-
secutor, it was allotted to me to conduct a prosecution against several persons, servants on
.an estate near Berrima, charged with the murder of a man in tiie same employment.
The trial lasted the whole day, and tiie evidence variously affected the prisoners; but
there was one of them—John Lynch, on whom it had fixed a more prominent part in the
perpetration of the deed than tiie others. Towards the close of the trial a very material
witness, ami one who was to have proved that Lynch hud been seen on the day of the
murder within a short distance of the spot on which an attempt had been marie to con-
sume the body by tire, and on other points, to bring guilt completely home to him, ap-
peared in the witness box in such a state of intemperance, that his testimony was value-
less. Owing to that incident I attributed —and did not hesitate at the time to avow it—
the prosecution failed, and Lynch, with the others, was acquitted. The presiding judge
(the present Sir William Button) most deservedly imposed a fine of £5O on the delinquent
witness, who was the overseer of the estate, on which the prisoners were convicts. This
occurred in 1835. and six years afterwards, during the absence of the present respected
Attorney-General in England, his office devolved on me, and it became my duty at the
Berrima assizes of that year, to prosecute this same Lynch for a murder perpetrated
under circumstances of great enormity. Por that murder he was tried, convicted, and
executed. But the worst respecting him remains to be told. In the interval between his
acquittal in 1835, ami his conviction in 1842, he committed nine distinct murders, making
the sum of his terrible guilt to amount to eleven murders, to which he confessed previous
to his execution ; and in this admitted catalogue of his crimes, he acknowledged that the
murder of Ids fellow servant on the estate near Berrima. was one in which he had a prin-
cipal share. To add the greater guilt to deeds so horrible, these deeds were perpetrated
under circumstances of atrocity to which, from his own narrative taken down from his
lips, which I have read, the records of crime in this or any other country, furnish no
parallel. A memorable and dreadful example of the calamity that may befal a commu-
nity when a man, charged with a serious crime, of which lie is guilty, is tried and ac-
quitted, ami let loose again upon society—a far more dangerous jicst than before—embold-
ened by impunity with fresh desperation and augmented hardihood to enter anew upon
a career of crime, and calculating upon the difficulty of the proof of guilt, of which hts
experience of the ordeal through which he has lately passed, inspires a natural assur-

colonies emphatically intoxication was the hot bed of crime ; “ directly
or indirectly, all crime is traceable to it—the exceptions being so few
as to establish the general rule.” - It was a significant comment on the
habits of the times amongst the classes usually most productive of
criminals, that there were none but criminal cases for trial at the sitting.
One was of two men for a murder in the Wide Bay District. They were
both convicted, and executed on the Bth of July following, protesting their
innocence up to the last moment. Only four executions had previously
occurred in Moreton Bay—one, of two natives for aiding in the murder of
Mr. Stapleton, the surveyor—who were hanged at the old windmill ; and
the second, of two convicts, who suffered death behind the barracks, for
the murder of two fellow prisoners. These were in the penal times ; but
after them and prior to the establishment of the Circuit Court, offenders
were tried at Sydney, and the gaol there was the place of execution, from
which, on this occasion, the executioner’s apparatus had to be procured.
Another and somewhat remarkable trial, was that of three soldiers of
the 11th regiment of the line (a detachment of which was quartered here
at the time), for wounding a native. A false alarm was given one night
that the blacks were spearing cattle close to Brisbane, and rumour and
fright, as usual, exaggerating the danger, the military were called out, and
marched in pursuit, the officer in command directing his men not to fire
without orders. When they came to the place where the blacks were
camped, they found no signs of marauding, but there seems to have been
same unnecessary outcry, on which three or four hasty shots were fired,
and some of the natives hurt, and with this offence the men were charged.
One of them was found guilty, and sentenced to six months’ imprison-
ment. Some blame appears to have attached to the police, and the chief
constable was dismissed ; I mention the matter simply as showing that
justice was not invariably withheld in the case of wrong done to the
aborigines.
Out of one of the minor trials arose a point as to the legality of the
“ calabashes,” which I have before described. Two orders for insignifi-
cant amounts had been stolen, whereupon the question of value was
started, the indictment having been so framed as to charge the accused
with the theft of property of value equal to the amount which the orders
nominally represented. The judge was of opinion, that the documents
being illegal under the Act forbidding the making of notes or bills for
amounts under twenty shillings—the prisoner might be acquitted, hut re-
served the point: the Attorney-General thought the makers of all such
orders liable to prosecution. At the final judgment of the full court, in
(he following July, the orders were declared to be valueless—whether


their issue was criminal, the judges declined to say, that question not
being before them. The Act (5 Geo. IY., No. 1) then in force, imposed a
penalty of not less than £5 or more than £lO upon the maker for every
■order or note he might issue. Nevertheless they continued to be made
long after the time I am now referring to, and, in fact, in the interior,
formed almost all the small currency of the country. The bid adage,
that necessity has no law, may be supposed to be thus illustrated.
One practical result from this trial, was an increased desire for the
facilities and protection afforded by a bank. A request to the Bank of
Australasia for the establishment of a branch, was courteously acknow-
ledged, and promised to be laid before the directors, but before their reply
•could be obtained, the Bank of New South Wales cheered the hearts of the
residents by opening a branch in Brisbane, on November 14, and have
since had no reason to regret the step thus taken ; the trade of the district,
indeed, justified it. Comparing the exports from Moreton Bay for the
year 1850, with those of the preceding year, they exhibited a very satis-
factory increase—that on the last quarter of the year being £15,033 over
the amount of the corresponding quarter in 1819, the year showing a total
of £149,819. A very curious coincidence of figures occurs in the compari-
■son —the advance in the year over its predecessor being exactly the same as
“that of the last quarter of 1850 over the last quarter of 1849. The export
was, as beforetime, almost wholly confined to pastoral produce. In other
industries there was some talk, but not much real progress. I notice that
a bale of cotton was shipped from Sydney in January by Mr. Stuart A.
Donaldson, and the news of this seems to have somewhat stimulated the
Moreton Bay people. That the plant would grow was established clearly
enough, and much industry was evinced in calculations to prove that it
might be cultivated profitably. The estimates varied, but gave as a toler-
ably certain permanent return about £ls per acre. The few samples
which had reached the old country, had been highly spoken of, and Mr.
Donaldson, who took considerable interest in the experiment, procured
■seed from America, and sent a small quantity for distribution among the
settlers of Moreton Bay. Dr. Lang had, I believe, preceded him in ren-
•dering that kind of assistance. There was plenty of hope, not much en-
terprise, and, as usual, a great deal of doubt, latent if not expressed.
In its social progress the district kept steadily on. In Brisbane, the
School of Arts had so far advanced that plans for a new building were
■called for—lectures and entertainments of various kinds showing the
spirit of its supporters. The Eoman Catholic Church was finished ; the
Anglican Church commenced; and other religious denominations began
do house themselves. The hospital was well managed, and appreciated as


a valuable institution. A new Custom House, which still forms part of
the modest looking structure which shrinks from notice in the hollow be-
tween Queen Street and the river near Petrie’s Bight, was built ; and
the people began then to grumble at the deficient supply of pure water.
The education question, even in those early days, supplied topic of debate,
and lectures were delivered by the advocates of the then rival systems,
“denominational” and “ national," the more cosmopolitan comprehen-
siveness of the “secular” not having been yet attained to. But in the fer-
vour of their intellectual dissipation, the residents showed that they
retained “a frugal mind,” and established a building society ; and they,
moreover, had the advantage of an extension of legal blessings in the
shape of the establishment of a branch of the Insolvent Court, the Police
Magistrate acting as local Commissioner. In the interior, and towards
the north, the process of settlement was quietly carried on, and Govern-
ment sales were held at Ipswich, Drayton, and Warwick, of the lands in
their respective vicinities. A township was established, at least in name,
at Cleveland ; and clerks of petty session were appointed for the districts-
of Wide Bay, and the Maranoa, and at Gayndah. Wide Bay was gradu-
ally creeping into some importance as an outlet for the pastoral districts
of the same name and for the Burnett, and some impatience was mani-
fested for the survey of a township and the sale of allotments.
The great trouble of the residents—especially in the interior —was
the blacks ; and the native police a force of natives who have un-
dergone a certain amount of training for the purpose, and are officered
by Europeans—were in pretty constant requisition. At Mr. Dangar's
station, on the Condamine, a concerted attack was made, the hut -keeper
killed, and damage inflicted to the extent of £250 in value. The whole
district was described by the Commandant of the Police as in a most dis-
turbed state, several stations having been abandoned and twelve men
killed. The condition of the frontie.r was, in fact, one of war, and we
read of set encounters between the police and the aborigines, much as of
those between the troops and the Basutos in the Cape Colony. Mr. Frede-
rick Walker, the then Commandant, writes :—“ lam convinced, that if
properly officered by white persons, the natives of the colony would make
as good troops as the natives of India. I know that as long as their
officers stood none of the Native Police would stir.” He had little dif-
ficulty in establishing a more quiet state of things than he found—though
at what cost I see no record of—and established Ids head quarters at Cal-
landoon, on the Macintyre River. But from the Wide Bay and Burnett,
there arose wailing acd protest. Shs“p were driven off, and shepherd*
murdered, ruauh by (b, oil at d>o.»ishun fWliKsleon, some of the


sheep were recovered, and the blacks were reported as, under their vigor-
ous regime, becoming “ more tractable : ” there needs no interpreter to
explain what that means. Farther north, an adventurous traveller ap-
pears to have taken advantage of this ameliorated condition. A Mr. 6.
Francis, then recently from Port Phillip, reached a distance of about
ninety miles north of the Burnett Eiver, and seems to have discovered the
Fitzroy.
There was grievance, too, in the higher walks of civilization. A New
South Wales Postal Act had imposed a charge of one penny for the car-
riage of a newspaper, at which the wrath of the press was excited. But
the proprietor of the Courier derived consolation from an unusual source.
He informed his subscribers that, “ as some inducement to them to pay up
their accounts before they become deeply stricken in years, the postage
will be deducted from all accounts with this journal that are not suffered
to run more than six months ” —which suggests a halcyon period when
credit and impocuniosity were twins. The editor fell foul of the authori-
ties because, although £35 had been voted for the salary of a letter car-
rier, none had been appointed —to the great discomfort of the mercantile
and trading community ; and protest and representation were suggested.
In due time the required official was appointed, and a ray of peace shone
upon the editorial and mercantile mind.
The year 1831 commenced in heat, meteorologically and politically :
the thermometer on New Year’s Day stood at 101° within doors ; and the
friends and opponents of convict labour took up their respective sides in
undisguised hostility. A meeting of stockholders and others in favour of
separation with “ exiles,” was called for January 11 ; and the notice was
immediately followed by another from the opposite party, for a second or
rather contemporaneous meeting, to protest against such an accompani-
ment of the main object. The followers of each were numerous, and I
confess that I find some names on the list of the advocates of “ exile ”
labour, which X should almost as readily expect at the present day, to see
in a committee for the introduction of Kanakas. These went to work in
a business-like way ; formed themselves at their meeting into what they
termed the Moreton Bay and Northern Districts Separation Association :
adopted a petition to the Queen in furtherance of their object; and re-
solved upon a canvass of the district, to raise subscriptions towards the
expenses they incurred. But, prohibiting all dissent from their resolu-
tions, and refusing admission at their meeting to any one opposed to their
views, they gave a colouring to their procedure which it would have
shown better tactics to have avoided. “The high price and extreme
scarcity of labour." was the burden of their cry. Their opponents as-


Bembled in public meeting, and adopted a petition in which, setting forth
the claims and prospects of the districts, they “ humbly but solemnly pro-
test against the resumption of transportation in any form, or upon any
condition whatever.” In this course they were stimulated and encouraged
by the success with which the Victorians were combating against what
they considered a great evil. But the advocates of forced labour were
united and persevering. While a new Electoral Bill was passing through
the Legislative Council, which met early in April, they were canvass-
ing and collecting, and preparing for an election campaign. When that
bill was laid on the table, it appeared that the Council was to consist
of forty-eight members, sixteen of whom were to be nominees of the
Crown. Three members were to be given to the Moreton Bay districts ;
one to the County Stanley ; one for the united districts of Clarence and
Darling Downs ; and one for the united districts of Moreton, Wide Bay,
Burnett, and Marauoa. As the bill passed through the House, additions
were made, bringing up the total number of elective members to thirty-
six ; and Moreton Bay secured one of these for an electorate called the
Stanley Boroughs, comprising North and South Brisbane, Kangaroo
Point, and Ipswich—an addition opposed oddly enough by Dr. Lang, on
the supposition that it would give another member to the squatting party
ia the House. And it is curious to read how not the bases of electoral
right—whether of population or of property—were considered in the dis-
cussion, but simply the use that might be made of it if granted. That
the boroughs were constituted an electorate only made the exile separa-
tionists more eager; and, on May 17—less than a month after the passage
of the electoral bill—the Northern Districts Association held another
meeting in Brisbane, at which they passed a resolution affirming that the
majority of the people concurred in their views, and appointed two dele-
gates—the Hon. Louis Hope and Mr. Colin Mackenzie—to wait upon Earl
Grey with copies of the resolutions adopted. Mr. A. Hodgson, who had
taken an active part in the formation and advocacy of the association,
with considerable energy avowed his attachment to, and interest in, the
district which was his home ; and soon after, with some complacency,
published a letter from Earl Grey, in reality a reply to one addressed to
the Earl by that gentleman, his lordship suggesting, that if the Legisla-
ture of New South Wales proved obdurate, the district residents could ap-
ply for separation, and so get the labour of which they stood in need.
But some of the electors of the Stanley Boroughs thought otherwise, and,
at a public meeting, unanimously nominated Mr. R. Jones, who had been
member for the former county, as their candidate, he being distinctly
pledged as a strong anti-transportationist. The association put forward
Mr. Hughes, of Gowrie—a station on the Darling Downs —in opposition


to Mr. Jones, and Mr. W. Wilson, of the Peak Mountain Station, as their
nominee for the county. This was followed up by a meeting at Ipswich,
at which rcsolutious in favour of both gentlemen were canned. To meet
Mr. Wilson, Mr. John Eichardson, a merchant of Brisbane, was induced
to enter the field. In the Darling Downs and Wide Bay electorates, it
■was known that there would be no contest—the purely pastoral character
of the district, and the small number of votes, leaving the choice in fact
in the hands of the station proprietors. Dr. Lang, in a letter addressed to
the residents in Moreton Bay, suggested, that practically, the discovery of
the goldfields had destroyed all prospect of any portion of Eastern or
Southern Australia becoming in any shape a convict colony, and that
separation was the principal object for which to ' fight ; but the people
thought that they could appreciate the work to be done, and declined to
abandon either of the grounds on which they had based their selection of
members. There is no doubt, that the abandonment of the pro-transpor-
tation party by Mr. Wentworth, and the weight thrown by his great
ability and high reputation into the opposite scale, was no small encour-
agement to them in their course, although the discovery of gold was
alleged by him as the sole ground for his change of opinion. A powerful
argument was afforded them by a notice in the Government Gazette, that
no less than a hundred and thirty-seven ticket-of-leave holders, in More-
ton Bay, had had their tickets cancelled, for absence from their allotted
‘ districts, a fact which spoke volumes, both as to the value and certainty of
the labour, which the system contended for, was likely to supply. Both
sides put forward their utmost strength, and the result was that, at the
election in September, Mr. Jones and Mr. Eichardson were both elected.
Whether or not, it was from a conviction that the transportation cause
had become hopeless, that the other two members—Messrs. Bigge and
Leslie —remained quietly at home, I cannot say, but their two colleagues
formed part of a majority which, in the new Legislative Council of New
South Wales, passed strong resolutions against “ the continuance of trans-
portation, in any form whatever, to any of Her Majesty’s Australasian
. possessions.” Before this, the Order-in-Council for its revival had been
revoked by the Horae Government; but, in November, a despatch was re-
ceived from Earl Grey, in reply to the petitions of the stockholders, which
I have before described, in which his lordship referred to the impossibility
of the Home Government acting in such a matter, in opposition to the
wishes expressed by the local Legislature, and almost despairingly sug-
gested that if the—
“ Legislature, which must be regarded as authorised to express the wishes
of the community it represents, should think it right to reconsider the
opinion it has declared, and to request that convicts should again be sent,


in limited numbers, to the above-mentioned district only, I am not aware
of any reason why this should not be done.”—
Seed thrown by a skilful hand, but on barren ground.
Dr. Lang, who had during the year, involved himself in proceedings
for libel by some ill-advised remarks upon the supposed conduct of a mem-
ber of the old Legislative Council, who had concurred in a vote of censure
on himself for his procedure in his immigration scheme, and been visited
with fine and imprisonment, as a consequent punishment, emerged from
his confinement to be placed, at the general election, at the head of the
poll as one of the three members for the City of Sydney. It was not
long before he visited the Moretou Bay District, where his first political
step was to deliver a characteristic lecture on separation, proposing that
the northern boundary of the colony should be kept at the Tropic of Cap-
riooru ;* the southern one remaining, as it ivas understood it would be,
at the 30th parallel of south latitude. A public meeting was held at
Brisbane, a few days afterwards, when a temperate and argumentative
petition for separation was adopted, and Dr. Lang was requested to take
charge of it, and to act as delegate on behalf of the district. A set of re-
solutions, affirming practicability of the profitable growth of cotton at
Moreton Bay, and recommending a scheme of immigration on the same
plan as that employed by Dr. Lang, was carried without dissent, and com-
mitted to his care to lay before the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and such other parties in Great
Britain as might be likely to aid in carrying out the system proposed.
The doctor then addressed the meeting, and is recorded to have met with
unanimous applause, both at the commencement and conclusion of his
speech. At Ipswich, the proceedings took a more business-like shape.
The petition adopted by the Brisbane people was somewhat altered, on
the motion of Mr. Macalister, then emerging into public life, so as to ask
specifically for semi-representative institutions analogous to those of Kew
South Wales. The thanks of the meeting were voted to the doctor for his
past efforts, and about £IOO subscribed towards the expenses of his jour-
ney to England. It was understood that he declined further pecuniary
connection with emigration schemes, the last one having, as he reiterated
—and he was not contradicted—involved him in heavy monetary loss ;
and he returned to Sydney, sanguine of being able to influence a large and
continuous stream of immigration to the district for the cultivation of

cotton, and tlic planting a new industrial colony, prosperous in itself, and
a source of prosperity to the empire of which it formed a part.
But the discovery of gold, to which I have before incidentally re-
ferred, not only did more than any other circumstance or agency could
have effected in terminating transportation to the eastern and southern
Australian Colonies, hut exerted an effect scarcely dreamed of by Dr.
Lang and his friends at the time : it, so to speak, snuffed out the claims
of the non-auriferous colonics in the eyes of the emigrating British pub-
lic, who rushed with one accord to those where the precious metal was
to be found. The Eagle., steamer, brought the news of Hargreaves' dis-
covery on May 28, and “ it seemed,” (says the Courier), “ to have made
the Sydney people half mad, which only shows how excitable they are.”
In another week, there were symptoms of the lunacy having extended
when the news was confirmed, and the extent and value of the discovery
found to be beyond all expectations. It was remembered that the Divid-
ing or “ Main ” Kango, as it was called, was a continuation of that near
which the gold had been found at Bathurst, and exploration was forthwith
exhorted, while speculation was rife and hope strong, as to the investment
of fortunate diggers from the south of their new capital and remaining
energies in a field so favourable as the northern districts for all industrial
enterprises. There was some present drawback to these pleasurable im-
aginings, in the immediate rise in the prices of flour and bread, whereby
the bakers fell on troublous times, and combinations to import for private
use were threatened and not formed. The labouring portion of the com-
munity spoke of an increased wage, on the unreasonableness of which,
they wove lectured, both orally and in loading articles, but, to no purpose.
The fever was not allayed by the continuous tidings of new “finds,” which
crowded the columns of the journals ; and I notice that sixty-six steerage
passengers left Moreton Bay, for Sydney, on June 19. A party was
formed in Ipswich to prospect the range at once—a judicious step if the
condition of the town were as forlorn as described. “ Business is at a,
complete stand-slill” (writes a correspondent) : “ the auctioneer's bell is
often heard, hut it is perfect labour in vain. Not a single buyer can be
found, for nil are sellers.” [The italics are not mine.] “ The discoveries
of gold are daily increasing ” (wrote the Bathurst Free Press); and one
co'isoquencc was, that in Sydney, great distress arose among the wives
and families of absent diggers, on which the Herald is reported in the
Courier of Juno 20, to have advocated an Act of Council “to compel those
worthless men to return to their families.” They, who, in Moreton Bay,
were, in their own Language, “ firmly impressed with the opinion, that the
goldfield of New South Wales extends to the districts of Stanley and Dar-
ling Downs,” gave expression to it in the shape of promised subscriptions,


to the extent of about £9OO, towards a'reward to bo paid to the finder of
a field equal to that of Bathurst, Then came news that Sydney had be-
come dull at a temporary cessation of mining activity ; and in another
fortnight, that the people of Bathurst were wild with delight at new dis-
coveries, in which the find of a hundred weight of gold by one fortunate
prospector, stood prominently out. The excitement here rose high, at the
end of July, at intelligence that the Government had received informa-
tion of the finding of gold on the Darling Downs, and that the Herald
reported “ that there was no doubt of a goldfield being discovered in that
locality.” Men went to bed at night dreaming of glittering sands and
nuggetty ravines, and rose in the morning to calculate their possible gains
if those dreams were realised. We sometimes go afar to learn news of
home, and the Jloreton Bay people were edified in August by what was
news to them, that a fine specimen of auriferous quartz, sent from their
district, had reached Sydney. The Courier of the 9th of that month was
radiant with “finds.” A specimen had been brought in from a spot near
Brisbane—possibly one of the gullies running easterly from Taylor’s
Range. Another was affirmed to have been picked up on the banks of the
river, at a place to which, being easy of access, a miscellaneous “rush” on
a small scale, took place, with an odd assortment of digging tools, which
included a colander and a baby’s cradle, but nothing was found. What
looked more serious was information—apparently authoritative—that
gold had been found on Canning Downs, and specimens sent to the late
Rev. W. B. Clarke, the celebrated geologist, and that the finder intended
to claim the reward. To wind up the week, the discoverer of the quartz
turned up, and declared himself to be sanguine that there was more where
that came from. A Government surveyor found gold at Thanes’ Creek,
on the Darling Downs, and it was next reported, that it had been dis-
covered in quantity, in the Wide Cay District ; but Gympie was reserved
for a future and more exigent period. Amidst the alternate exultation
and depression which rumour and contradiction excited, the extraordinary
richness of the newly-opened fields in Victoria added to the excitement,
and gave cause for despondency to those residents who were compelled to
remain to deplore a possible exodus, which realised, would to them be
ruin. They plucked up spirit again at reported fresh discoveries at Mount
Brisbane and Widgee Widgee, but the reports did not prevent a continu-
ous migration—especially from the localities nearest the port—and I read
of an unfortunate station holder on the Logan commencing shearing, him-
self and one shearer being the total available amount of labour. The
rumours did not abate up to the end of the year, but with no tangible re-
sult, except that their multiplicity awakened the attention of the Kcw
South Wales Government, who, to the gratification of the residents, pro


posed to send Mr. Hargreaves to Moreton Bay, early in 1852. Nobody
bad the slightest doubt of there being plenty of gold in the district, but
most people wanted faith in those who were looking for it. Here was the
right man coining to unlock the treasures which only awaited a discerning
eye and skilful hand to be thrown open to the people.
But all was not neglected for gold. The cultivation of cotton was
pursued, but with a caution which must have seemed cold to the enthusi-
asm of Dr. Lang. The bale which had been sent to England from Sydney
by Mr. Donaldson, In the preceding year, was reported upon favourably
by Mr. Boothman, the secretary to the Manchester Chamber of Com-
merce ; but one point was dwelt upon which seems scarcely to have re-
ceived sufficient attention by the cotton growers of this colony ; the
importance of avoiding mixture of staple. Another matter referred to,
was the evident desire to rival the Sea Island variety of the United States,
which was strongly deprecated as not required by the nature of the home
demand ; not more than thirty thousand bags of that particular kind be-
ing consumed in England out of the whole vast import. The suggestive-
mess of this latter advice was, I fear, suffered to pass unnoticed, for, in our
first Land Act after Separation, the bonus authorised to be paid on the
export of Sea Island cotton, was just twice that for the export of the
more common varieties. The Government of New South Wales threw out
a little encouragement. They offered premiums of £SO for the best fifty
pounds weight of cotton wool, and of £25 for the same quantity of the
next best. Dr. Hobbs was amongst our foremost experimentalists, and
produced good samples from some of the seed which had been forwarded
by Mr. Donaldson for distribution. Mr. Robert Douglas was similarly
hopeful, and similarly successful; and while their efforts indicated faith,
news came to inspire hope. Mr. Poole, of Brisbane, had sent samples to
Messrs. Young and Co., of London, who, in reply, stated their value at 9d.
to Is. per lb., and authorised immediate purchases to the amount of
£IOOO, if they could bo made. On.this, it was proposed to form a cotton-
growing company, on the principle on which building societies are
founded ; but I do not see that anything came of the proposition. The
first really commercial transaction that I find recorded, was the purchase
by Mr. Poole, from Mr. Douglas, of about half a ton of cotton, which was
shipped in September, although, from the difficulty of ginning in the seed,
the practical result of Mr. Douglas’ experiment was not very encouraging,
the profit on the unginned cotton from an acre of ground being reported
as under £5 ; had facilities for proper ginning existed, the profit would
have been greater. Another agricultural product, which now receives
the attention it deserves at the hands of cultivators, also crept into
notice. Mr. Childs, of Breakfast Creek, had turned his attention to


arrowroot, at his farm there, and this t'ear had half a ton of roots in
the ground. The samples of the previ ms year's produce sent to Sydney
were liked, and readily disposed of, but in this, as in most new indus-
tries, want of experience and paucity of capital were hindrances in the
way of that success which entitles them to be considered national. Min-
ing for coal was struggling to assert itself as a profitable pursuit. Mr.
John Williams, who had been a Chartist of some note, at a time when the
once celebrated “ five points ” were not in such favour as, in the guise of
liberal principles, they have since been, opened the first mine in More-
ton Bay, on the south side of the river Brisbane, about four miles from
Wolston. The mine was worked four years, and then, by the rising of
the river, flooded out, the scam dipping as it was opened. Williams then
commenced another pit at Moggill, on the north side of the river, about
sixteen miles from Brisbane by the road, which he worked with sufficient
success to induce him this year to establish a depot for the sale of his
coal iu the town. Another coal mine on the western bank of the Bremer,
and a short distance from Ipswich, is also noticed as having been opened
by Messrs. Heed and Boyland, and with promising prospects.
In other matters, the residents worked tolerably well together. A
School of Arts building was completed in Brisbane. The simple accom-
modation it afforded was sufficient for some years for the wants of the
members ; but its nondescript style of architecture could have exerted
but a perverse influence oh artistic education. A market was proclaimed
and trustees chosen ; a new Evangelical chapel was completed and
opened, as well as a Wesleyan chapel and a Presbyterian church at South
Brisbane. Ipswich was not behind hand in effort towards the establish-
ment of a literary institution of a more permanent character than the
library and reading room. Nor were pleasure and health neglected : the
capabilities of the bay coast, near Cabbage Tree Crock, were examined,
and the first step taken towards the settlement of Sandgate. In the out-
lying districts, the progress was moderate. Maryborough was proclaimed
a township, and the settlers had at length the luxury of bidding against
each other for town allotments.
While in matters that savoured of speculation, there was little of co-
operative spirit in the people of Brisbane, they united readily enough where
the benefit to be scoured was tangible ami certain, and iu nothing were
they more anxious—except for the discovery of gold—than for the im-
provement of the port. £IOO had been voted by the Legislative Council
towards a survey of the obstructions at the mouth of the river, in aid of
which some subscriptions were invited, but, not much to the credit of the
up-country inhabitants, the invitation was responded (o by the residents


of Brisbane only. A committee was organised to superintend the ex-
penditure, and Mr. Donaldson, on their application, sent them a civil en-
gineer—Mr. Debonham—to make the necessary surveys and reports. By
the end of J une that gentleman had completed his task. lam unable to
quote his report at length, but it was of sufficient merit to deserve an-
alysis, if only for purposes of reference hereafter. His first question was,
whether the formation of a channel, across the bar was practicable ; his
second, the best method of effecting that object. The first he answered
affirmatively ; and, as to the second, recommended dredging—but he was
emphatic in insistance on the necessity for a preliminary improvement of
the river navigation by damming up the boat and other channels, and, as
far as possible, contracting the bed of the river to a uniform width. This
done, he considered the dredging of the bar would be greatly facilitated,
and the maintenance of the channel easy. The cost he estimated at
£30,000 ; and the time required, six years. The late Mr. A. Petrie, upon
the publication of this report, suggested marking the lino of channel by
beacons, and the use of a simple machine to break up the bottom surface,
leaving the disturbed matter to be carried off by the current. And with
that, for a time, the matter dropped.
The circuit courts sat twice in the year—an application for a resident
judge having been refused—and the calendar was heavy in both instances.
At the May assize, thirty-one prisoners were in gaol awaiting their trials ;
and of these two were for murder, one for a mail robbery, and a consider-
able number for crimes of a grave character. At the November sittings,
a Chinese and an aboriginal were both found guilty of murder. There
seems to have been a good deal of minor criminality in the district—and
of a kind which might have been expected from the class from which the
criminals principally came. The additions to the population by immigra-
tion were small. On February 8, the Ruches* of Xorthumherland brought
227 immigrants, some of whom immediately left to join relatives in New
South Wales. Some discussion took place on a proposed introduction of
Germans, and a more angry one on the results of the Chinese importations
which had been made by some of the larger employers, with results that
led to a general condemnation of that kind of labour. The settlers were
sorely straightened, and the policy of the Colonial Office, equally with
that of the New South Wales Government towards them, was not of a
kind to afford them aid, or induce their respect.
The blacks continued a source of annoyance, and loss of both life and
property. A party of between four and five hundred attacked an out-
station on M'Encroe’s run, in the Maranoa District, drove off a mob of
cattle, and ftrisd to fire the hut, so es to get at the overseer—an attempt


which cost four of them their lives. They were afterwards followed, and
a number of the cattle recovered, after a fight, in which nine blacks were
killed. In the Burnett District they were again unremitting in their at-
tacks, and the life of the outlying settler must have been one of continu-
ous anxiety and alarm. It is not surprising that squatting settlement was
not, under such circumstances, much extended, or exploration attempted.
Rumours came in that Leichhardt and his party had been murdered be-
fore they had quite got through the Maranoa District; but nothing of a
definite nature could be arrived at, and, at length, it was determined to
send a party in search of him in charge of Mr. Hovenden Heiy, who had
been with Leichhardt in the abortive attempt which terminated at the
Peak Downs.
I have now arrived at a period when a halting place may well be
marked in the progress of this history. On March 1, 1851, the census of
the colony of New South Wales was taken ; on April 3, 1831, the last one
of the colony of Queensland was collected ; thirty years separating the
two dates. It will not be uninteresting or uninstructive to note, with
more than usual detail, the numbers, conditions, and avocations of the
people of, what we may call, our own country at the earlier time. I omit
the district of Clarence, then included in the northern districts.
The total area of those districts as proclaimed, was 58,860 square miles.
On that area there were living 8,575 souls, divided into 6,012 males, and
2,563 females, of whom 1,558 males and 1,180 females were more than
twenty-one years of age, and only 68 above sixty ; 1,169 of the males
wore set down as married, and 1,026 of the females, being an exceedingly
small proportion. As to their civil condition, 3,895 males had arrived
free or were natives of the colony, and 3,656 females; 1,469 males and
105 females had become free, and there were 473 ticket-of-leave holders—
males ; and two females of the same class. I scarcely attach much value
to some of the statistics as to religion ; but the analysis would not he com-
plete without them, and the large numbers of Mohammedans and Pagans
possess a certain significance. The numbers stand thus :—Professing
members of the Church of England, 3,639 ; of the Church of Scotland,
980 ; Wesleyans, 298 ; other Protestants, 522 ; Roman Catholics, 2,318 ;
Jews, 13 ; Mohammedans and Pagans, 571 ; and other persuasions—in-
cluding, I suppose, those of no persuasion at a 11—24. The educational re-
turn was a melancholy 0ne—3,678 males could read and write, and 1,251
females—in all, 4,929, not much more than half the entire population.
1,322, could read ; the rest were destitute of any semblance of education.
The nationalities of the inhabitants are worth glancing at: 1,847 were
born in the colony of New South Wales ; 3,075 were English ; 38 Welsh ;


1,939 Irish ; .793 Scotch ; 145 came from other British possessions ; and
the remainder, almost wholly males, from foreign countries. For conve-
nience sake, I tabulate the occupations in which they were said to be
engaged :

Residue of Population 2,249
The preponderance of residents employed in connection with pastoral
pursuits, was in accordance with the then character of the local industries ;
but I confess I am puzzled by the number of horticulturists and of edu-
cated persons with no special avocation. The returns as to houses will
afford opportunity for some curious contrasts. There were 1,021 in all
the northern districts, 718 of which were in the county of Stanley, I pre-
sume mostly in Brisbane and Ipswich. Of the whole number, 111 were
of stone or brick, and not one had a slated roof. The town populations
comprised, at that time, more than half the grand total. In Brisbane and
the suburbs there were 2,543 ; in Ipswich, 932 ; in Maryborough, 299 ;
in Warwick, 267 ; in Drayton, 200 ; and in Gayndah, 92. All the legal
fraternity, and seventeen of the medical men, were collected in Bris-
bane and Ipswich. It may possibly be, that the entire absence of legal
aid was conducive to that peace of mind which tends so much to the
promotion of physical health, and so, in the interior, medical assistance
vas less required.
The progress since 1846 had been great, the population had been
nearly doubled in every one of the old districts, and new ones had been
added ; hut the preponderance of the towns was not a healthy sign, and
the continued restriction to a solitary staple was no subject for con-
gratulation. The value of the exports for the year was £181,038, an in-
crease of £31,219 on those of 1850, the items still showing but a small
amount attributable to other than pastoral pursuits, timber being the prin-

cipal, and aby no means remarkable, exception. So far, figures afforded
encouragement, yet, at the close of the year, the editor of the Courier de-
clared—despite the abolition of the newspaper { ostages, and removal to
better quarters,* that “ times were dull.” What will the historian of the
future collect from the statistics and the journalistic opinions of 1881 ?
• The office was now removed to the corner of George and Charlotte Streets, a site
which may, as history here goes, be cabled historical.


CHAPTER VIII.
1852.
Efforts at Gold Discovery and Cotton Cultivation—The Separation and Transportation Ques-
tions—Unanimous Abandonment of the Transportation Cause —Opposition of the New
South Wales Government to Transportation — Hely's Expedition in Search of Leichhardt —
Social Progress—The Natires—Local Industries—Moreton Bay Steam Navigation Com-
pany—Rainfall and Temperature.
With the year 1832 the desire for gold increased, and the wish took prac-
tical expression in finding funds by public subscription for the equipment
of prospecting parties in various directions, whose researches invariably
resulted in failure. It may be doubted whether any of the efforts made
were of a kind to determine the gold-bearing qualities of the districts
tried with anything like certainty, but at the time, either from want of
money or from absolute despair, the conclusions arrived at were generally
accepted. There was one enquiry which had been looked to with consi-
derable hope, and whose futility therefore caused more than ordinary
vexation. Mr. Hargreaves came with all the prestige of past discovery,
and of Government authority and assistance, but the promised examina-
tion can scarcely be considered other than a flying visit of the most cur-
sory description. It was, in fact, little more than an ordinary journey by
the routes to the principal townships on the Downs, and then through
Cunningham’s Gap to Ipswich, thence to Mount Brisbane and back, and
so to Brisbane itself. For all useful purposes the trip might well be re-
garded as valueless, and his report, when published, met with not a little
uncomplimentary criticism. Later in the year the settlement was agitated
by a rumour that an extensive goldfield had been found at Bingara Creek,
a tributary of the Gvvydir Kiver, and not very far west of the township of
Warialda. As this was within the boundary understood to be determined
upon whenever Separation should take place, no small excitement fol-
lowed the intelligence, and it was not long before parties were formed
and travelled from Brisbane, Ipswich, and other localities, towards the
supposed golden region. So strong was the belief in its importance, that
those who did not fo themselves, experienced its influence in a variety of


forms. Employers found the possibility of high wages staring them in
the face, and labourers gleefully anticipated that contingency. The
police applied for an increase of their pay and allowances. Unfortunately
all their hopes and fears were premature. It was soon discovered that
there was no field —that the gold was insignificant in quantity and uncer-
tain in deposit, and the wayfarers having seen the nakedness of the land,
returned weary, disappointed, and angry. The sole consolatory fact that
I find in the hopeful predictions and hopeless failures of the year, is. that
a former resident, who had been successful in his mining adventures,
realised the suggestion to which I have before referred, and showed his
faith in the district by sending money to purchase Land for future occu-
pation.
The cotton industry languished for want, as some said, of enterprise,
or, as others said, of labour. If reports on quality and price could stimu-
late, those received from time to time, should have made men sanguine,
but the reporter’s seem in all cases to have confined themselves to ap-
proval, and to have turned a deaf ear to any suggestions as to aid in
capital or machinery. Dr. Hobbs, an old colonist, and long a member of
our Legislative Council, sent samples to the editor of the Economist, who,
in his turn, submitted them to a Manchester cotton spinner, who was “de-
lighted ” with them, and valued them at 19d. per lb., further bestowing
such encouragement as might be derived from his opinion, that “ the
Board of Trade and the Colonial Office should know the important fact
that Moreton Bay can produce very superior and truly beautiful cotton
wool.” Other samples forwarded to different quarters were appraised at
about the same value, but I am unaware of the precise extent of eulogy
which their merits elicited. However, the cultivation began to assume
a definite appearance—about twenty-seven acres of land being spoken of
as preparing for the purpose in August. Dr. Lang, who had arrived in
England, busied himself with characteristic energy in submitting samples,
obtaining estimates and reports, and pressing the suitability of the soil
and climate of Moreton Bay upon the attention of the British public.
Towards the close of the year, the hearts of the experimentalists were
cheered by a final and elaborate report, obtained at his instance, from the
Manchester Chamber of Commerce, in which the secretary wound up by
saying, “ I believe the cultivation of cotton in Moreton Bay—if that culti-
vation be pushed with energy—stands a better chance of success than any
new industry of which I have heard or read.” Could encouragement be
more direct, except, perhaps, the accompaniment of a moderate amount
of capital, to lay the foundation of so profitable an enterprise ? And
while on the subject of local industries, I may notice that Dr. Hobbs also
commenced the trial of coffee growing on a small scale this year. There


seems all through these trials to have been an ignorance of what had been
effected under the old convict regime by some of the most intelligent of
the officers, which can only be accounted for on the supposition that there
was so much of the bad in the work to be forgotten, that what was really
good perished in the general disinclination to recollect.
At the commencement of the year, the residents had enough to
trouble them as to labour. During the previous twelve months the sup-
ply had been, as we have seen, scanty, to the suspension of all but indis-
pensable work, and the squatter contemplated his chances rather sadly ;
but as time rolled on, their long continued remonstrances and petitions
began to boar fruit, the more grateful since the Chinese importations had
become nuisances; and, while adding slightly to the effective industrial
power, lengthened beyond all reasonable proportion the calendar of crime.
The Maria Shame*, the Ary;/le, the Meridian, and Rajah Onpavl, immi-
grant vessels, brought 1,119 souls, the greater number from Ireland, to add
to the population of the district, at which the people were glad ; but the
Itajah Gopaul brought, also, typhus fever, the discovery of which led to
quite an opposite feeling, and to the very proper visitation of the captain,
and surgeon with severe penalties. Sixty-four German immigrants came
by way of Sydney, and, by their quiet industry, gave general satisfaction,
the relief afforded was perceptible ; but Dr. Lang’s assiduous exertions
appear to have been none the less appreciated. At this period, too, the
attention of the Colonial Legislature was directed, with no little perse-
verance, to the consideration of the whole system of immigration, and
various schemes were suggested, which may generally be dismissed with
the remark that their Complex details, elaborated with much ingenuity,
could have only resulted in proportionate failure. The principal recom-
mendation of a select committee, that immigrants to whom a free passage
had been granted, should re-pay the colony at the rate of £l3 per head,
exhibited about as little policy as justice, and more of faith than pre-
caution.
Keither the want of labour, nor its ultimate supply, diverted the at-
tention of the people from the two questions of separation and the
renewal of transportation. The annual revenue derivable from the whole
of the northern districts, directly and indirectly, was not more than about
£30,000 ; but the advocates of separation urged that the public income of
Western Australia was considerably less; and the long withholding of a
fair proportion of the immigrants sent to the colony generally, was a
standing grievance ; while it was alleged that this district got by no
means its just share of the colonial outlay. And, as the injustice com-
plained of led to discontent, so the perpetual fluctuations of report engen


dered anxiety. One day the people were told that separation only wanted
some legal technicalities to be formally proclaimed ; on another, that,
not only would transportation be continued in its most objectionable form
to Van Diemen’s Land, but, that Earl Grey had told Mr. King, the Vic-
torian anti-transportation delegate, that “ nearly every respectable man
in the Moreton Bay District had signed the petition for separation—of
course, with the coveted exile accompaniment. The Northern Districts
Association, to promote separation with “ exiles,” sprang into renewed
activity, and on May 19, held a meeting of their supporters, at which Mr,
Arthur Hodgson moved the adoption of a petition to the Queen for separa-
tion, “ on the terms proposed ” —I presume in the former memorial—and
Mr. T. L. M. Prior, a resolution that a letter should be sent to the Secre-
tary of State, deprecating any further delay. The interference of the
Australasian Anti-Transportation League in the question was strongly
censured, and it was affirmed that the non-discovery of gold here having
resulted in a draft of labour to the more fortunate districts, the intro-
duction of exiles was absolutely necessary. All the resolutions were car-
ried without dissent, and it was supposed that the Association had achieved
a success ; but a few weeks after, the flattering notion was dispelled. In’
June a despatch from Earl Grey to Sir Charles Eitzroy was published,
acknowledging the receipt of the two petitions described in my last chap-
ter, and replying in detail to the requests embodied in each. Admitting,
that Her Majesty would have been justified from them in at once dividing
the colony, his lordship urged that separation would be best deferred until
the inhabitants of Moreton Bay had been able to test, by experience, the
value of the increased representation which they had in the newly-elected
Legislative Council; but he distinctly gave as his opinion that, if after
that, they continued dissatisfied, he should feel justified in advising that
the division should take place. As respected transportation, he stated,
that it the colony were divided, and the representatives of the new pro-
vince—not the Legislative Council of New South Wales, as Sir Charles
Fitzroy’s Executive had assumed—asked for the continuance or revival of
that system, the request might be granted, although some of the condi-
tions mentioned in the petition for it already sent were inadmissible.
Earl Grey ended by reminding the Governor, that the Executive minute
which accompanied the petitions, and was adverse to their prayer, was in
error in confining the estimate of the probable Customs revenue of the
new settlement to the amount actually received at the existing ports, as
that was manifestly open to increase by the suras received in Sydney on
dutiable goods consumed in the Moreton Bay District. It was tolerably
clear from this, that there was little chance of a renewal in any shape of
transportation to the district and that mos f certainly it would not be con


sidered a condition precedent to the granting of separation. After some
mutual remonstrance and explanation, a meeting of the inhabitants was
called to petition the Queen at once for separation, without any condition,
and the feeling that prompt action was required, was strengthened by a
misapprehension of a speech at Sydney, by a member of the Stanley
Boroughs, Mr. E. Jones, in which he was supposed to have said, that if
transportation were definitely abolished, his constituents would not so
much press for separation. When the meeting was held in August, it was
apparent that two dulcifying influences had been at work —one, the de-
spatch I have alluded to, which showed that the hope of “exiles” had
become an evanescent one—the other, that the arrival of the immigrant
vessels had rendered them less immediately necessary." Mr. Hodgson’s
capacity of spontaneous conversion was powerfully developed, and the
late Mr. St, George Gore found himself moving a resolution for separation,
which was to be seconded by one of the most ardent anti-transporta-
tionists of the day. Mr. W. Munro Smith. Dr. Cannan and Mr. R. Cribb
were at accord in supporting a petition to Her Majesty for separation, in
which—no doubt, to the great content of the latter—neither exiles, mili-
tary, police establishments, or compensating immigration, found mention.
There was at last unanimity, no doubt, promoted by the unusual presence
of ladies at the meeting, even in adopting the practical suggestion of Mr.
Little, that funds should be subscribed to provide for the expenses atten-
dant upon, and of publishing what had been done, and of procuring the
necessary signatures to, the petition. Everybody seemed in good humour,
but everybody was not. There were a few who either could not or would
not understand the true bearing of Earl Grey’s despatch, and protested
against the absence of stipulations against “ convictism ” in the petition,
not seeing that any such stipulation would be fatal to its reception. But
they had their growl, and so the controversy ended. Henceforth the con-
test was to be for separation alone.
A fair consideration of the difficulties and nature of the subject will,
I think, exonerate both parties to that protracted and sometimes bitter
dispute from much of the blame of opposite kinds that each has sustained.
I do not think that the squatters alone desired the renewal of transporta-
tion. The names which appear of its advocates prove the contrary —
although, as the largest employers of labour, they naturally attracted the
most attention. Custom deadens sensitiveness, and necessity suggests ex-
cuses. Those who, in the old count ry in advertising for a groom, would
have made it a condition, that 1 u exceptionable references ” should be
given, became familiarised by use with the attendance upon their friends
of servants whose sole reference was their ticket-of-leave. And when
men, who had become tolerant by f hat kind of u»e, saw their credit, and


even their profitable chance of living, gradually melting away from the
want of labour, it is not wonderful that they exerted themselves to get
that kind which appeared to be most easily retained and controlled. As
to the philanthropic claim of becoming reformatory instruments which
some paraded, as I never saw the effort in action I need not discuss its
validity. The hostility shown to, and the abuse lavished on, the anti-
transportation party, seems to have been exceedingly indefensible. Not
so directly interested iu the question, their prosperity depended upon that
of the great staple industry of the settlement, for if that failed, their cus-
tomers were gone. This they perilled, and they had at least an intelligent
principle upon which to take a stand. Their suspicion of the squat-
ters was, however, unpalatable to those who had nothing but the in-
stincts of self-preservation or the desire of wealth at the bottom of their
procedure, as well as to those who felt it really unjust ; still they saw,
that under the old Orders-in-Counoil, the possibility of legal offence by
some of them was treated as a not improbable contingency, and that only
recently had a squatting license conferred a vote, so that whatever might
be tile characters of some leading stockowners, there might be little
reason to respect the rank and file. Not having seen that prisoners might
be employed without danger, they retained dislikes which, in a colony
termed prejudices, in the society they had left were simply so natural as
not even to be discussed. It is creditable to both sides, that when the
final and wise determination of Earl Grey was given, both forgot their
dissensions, and heartily co-operated iu a cause of whose justice neither
could entertain a doubt.
After the first congratulations on the settlement of the question were
over, there was, as usual, some discussion as to whom it was to be
really attributed. Making every allowance for the weight attached to
local opinion, we arc not to forget the great influence exercised by
the united and energetic remonstrances of the gold-producing colonies
upon the final determination of the Colonial Office. Whether Moreton
Bay were a Crown colony or a representative one, it was clear that great
and general discontent would be excited throughout Australia, were con-
victs sent there. The effect of the new discoveries upon the public feel-
ing of the old country upon this question—at one time very languid—was
rapid and strong ; and, pressed by these converging forces, without in
form abandoning his own conviction, Earl Grey adopted a constitu-
tional opening for its practical disappearance. Thus many causes tended
to the same end ; although, and in no wise detracting from the good ser-
vice of what had before time been a forlorn hope, there is no doubt that,
so far as the expression of opinion in the district itself was concerned, the
settlers who came out in Dr. Lang's ships turned the scale.


It was soon evident, that on the remaining question of separation,
both exertion and unanimity would be required. The minute of the
New South Wales Executive Council forwarded to Bari Grey upon the
petitions for the erection of the district into a separate colony had, as I
have before implied, been hostile in tone, and not very fair in statement.
There was now to be added to the opposition already experienced, that of
the leading press and of the Legislature of the parent colony. The Syd-
ney Morning Herald, of August 18, referring to the meeting I have
described, observes : —“ It is difficult to mete out the portions of laughter,
pity, and contempt which must be awarded to our misguided fellow-
colonists lying to the northward of the 30th degree of latitude and Mr.
Wentworth, in the now Constitution Bill, which he introduced this year,
with characteristic dexterity, inserted a clause, which, if adopted, would
have left the Imperial Government no discretion as to the boundaries to
be fixed whenever separation did take place. For that clause declared
that those “of the colony of New South Wales shall not be curtailed on
the north side within the 20th degree of south latitude.” He would
thus have included all the most populous portion of the district—the pro-
posed line being east and west to the north of Gympie, and half-way
between that goldfield and Maryborough. The influence and character of
the man caused this attempt to be viewed with considerable alarm, not
lessened by the discovery that some Sydney residents interested in the
Clarence River Districts had been endeavouring to get up a petition there
against separation. On November 2, a meeting was held in Brisbane, at
which a short, but well-argued, petition to the Council was unanimously
adopted. It pointed out, that it was in fact, an attempt to override the
Imperial Act, 13 and II Vic., chap. 5, by which the Council itself was
constituted, and to abrogate the rights conferred by that Act upon the
petitioners, in which they had now a vested interest. Some strong terms
were made use of with reference to the conduct of the Sydney press, and
a hope was expressed that the appeal to the justice of the Council would
not be in vain—a hope whose futility experience soon demonstrated. The
adjournment of the Council left the petitioners unanswered till the fol-
lowing year. As to the general legislation of the colony, I find nothing
worth notice, except that the control and expenditure of its gold revenues
were conceded to it by the Crown. The end of the year found Moreton
Bay at the beginning of a contested election for the Stanley Boroughs,
Mr. E. Jones, their representative, dying on November 6. Mr. Jones had
been in the colony altogether thirty-three years, and had reached the
seventieth year of his age, and was much regretted in the district in which
the later period of his life had been spent. Dr. Lang and Mr. H. Stewart
Eussell, a respectable squatter of “ liberal ” tendencies, were spoken of as


candidates for the vacancy thus created, and ultimately, Dr. Lang being
in England, his name was withdrawn, and Mr. Russell elected.
There had been, from time to time, much anxiety expressed, and pro-
bably some felt, as to the fate of Leichhardt. Rumours of various kinds
had reached the boundaries of the settlement, all tending to show that the
intrepid explorer had died either from privation or violence, but none
sufficiently reliable to call for serious attention. To arrive, however, at
some conclusion on the subject, as I have before said, the New South
Wales Government determined to send an expedition on the route he had
indicated, and Mr. Hovenden Hely left Sydney on January 1 of this year,
with a party for that purpose. The bulk of his supplies were sent to Bris-
bane by sea, to meet him on the Darling Downs, he travelling overland
from the Hunter. He had with him six white companions, the usual
labour, and Brown, the aboriginal, who accompanied Leichhardt on his
first expedition. They arrived at Westbrook on March 2, and thence
proceeded to Surat, whore they found rumours, that about a hundred
miles to the north-west of Mount Abundance, Leichhardt and his associ-
ates had been murdered. These rested on no better authority than the
statements of the natives, but their particularity extending to a pretend-
ing power of identifying the spot of the catastrophe where the bones and
other relics of the party might be found, gave them some force. Mr. Hely
therefore resolved to proceed, taking with him six weeks’ provisions, leav-
ing some of liis party behind him to ascertain, if possible, in the locality
itself, the correctness of the rumour. He reached Mount Bindango with
some difficulty, more from want of water than from any other circum-
stance, and was then compelled to return. He again started upon what
may be called the main expedition, taking with him a black of the dis-
trict, named “ Billy,” as an interpreter, and now and then picking up a
native or two, from whom only indefinite information could be extracted.
All, however, concurred in the assertion, that Leichhardt had been mur-
dered, and in their description of the circumstances attendant upon his
death. The limit of Mr. Hely's journey was a chain of water holes, ap-
parently on the Warrego or one of its tributaries, situated in latitude 25°
30' S., and longitude HG° 35' E., where he fixed his twenty-second camp.
From this and his preceding camp as centres, he states that he explored
the country for forty-five miles north, east, and west, finding no tracks of
Leichhardt but the site of two camps, whose positions appear to have been
correctly indicated to him by the natives, and at short distances from his
own route. At the first were still— _
“the tent poles and forks, the heavy saplings upon which he had placed
his packs (showing that the gro'Uid must have been rsry nr at and damp),


and even the forked sticks and cross pieces in front of the fire at which
they had most probably roasted part of a kangaroo, the bones of which
were lying about. There was also in one place a large quantity of cattle
dung, showing where the bullocks had been bedded, but though Brown
and Billy, who were also with me, looked carefully for tracks coming to,
or departing from, this camp, they could find none, the soil being, as I
have found it ever since we reached the Maranoa, loose and sandy. The
most probable reason for our never having seen any of his camps before,
is, that at the time he left Mount Abundance, the whole country was in a
state of inundation, consequently he could travel in any direction, always
sure of plenty of water ; whereas, it has been so scarce since I have been
out, that we have been compelled to follow water courses, and even then
had to encamp more than once without any.”
In the second camp he found very much the same kind of marks, hut
an equal absence of tracks ; both were distinguished by a tree, marked
XXA in the lower part of a capital L. In the course t f his last explora-
tory excursions from the camp, he was deserted by his interpreter “ Billy ”
(who found his way safely back); and his provisions falling short, one of
his companions being ill, and the information as to the actual scene of the
supposed murder, at least uncertain, he resolved to re-trace his steps, and
arrived at Surat on July 20, having achieved nothing beyond ascertaining
the direction in which Leichhardt had actually gone, and a repetition of
the rumours upon which the expedition had been originally determined.
What might have been done at that time by a man of greater resolution
and resource, is another question.
The life of the district (apart from political matters and natural acci-
dent) must have been what is generally called “ humdrum.” There was now
and then a spurt of excitement at the supposed practicability of discover-
ing a goldfield ; there were meetings at the School of Arts, and there was
a debating or discussion class, whose subjects and whose eloquence were
of the usual kind. There seems, moreover, to have been already a sort of
nascent rivalry between the township at “ the head of navigation,” and
that which was the port —a rivalry not extinguished by a flood at Ipswich,
characterised at the time as the highest known there for eight or nine
years, the Bremer rising twenty-five feet. Brisbane was, of course, not left
unvisited, and the damage on the western tracks was considerable. A
proposal to blow up the Seventeen Mile Locks, on the river Brisbane, was
one of the forms in which the natural resultant grumbling found vent.
But both townships had their dignity increased —Ipswich actually, and
Brisbane in prospect—for a Police Magistrate was appointed to the
former, while Captain Wickham, it was understood, was to be promoted
to the higher title of Government Resident, thus giving to the latter, be-
sides its advantages of situation, the character of a provincial metropolis.


The Brisbane Hospital went on its useful and unostentatious way, and, as
now, afforded considerable accommodation to patients from all parts of
thecountry, without receiving a corresponding .support. The general traf-
fic on the then main roads I should imagine to have been small, from the
prices realised at the annual sale of the ferries across the Brisbane. There
were but two, and the principal one—that whose approaches from Queen
Street so long vexed horsemen and drivers, was sold in April for £ll3 ;
the other to Kangaroo Point for £l9. The Circuit Courts gave a relief to
the general monotony. There were forty-eight prisoners in gaol for trial
at the May circuit —a considerable number being Chinese, and that
nationality was, to use a diplomatic phrase of modem invention, “ade-
quately represented ” at the second court held in November ; but the
residents no longer looted upon the court as the benevolent novelty it was
when originally given to them, and wanted a resident judge for them-
selves, for which higher blessing they had to wait—a bill for the purpose
being rejected in the Legislative Council by nineteen to, sixteen. There
was a little jealousy of Cleveland ; and Cabbage Tree Creek began to as-
sume a position of some importance. The value of the anchorage at a
moderate distance from the shore, and the consequent rapidity with which
news might be brought to Brisbane from vessels newly-arrived in the bay,
being insisted upon, as well as the probability that masters of whalers
would avail themselves of the facilities thus presented, to secure supplies
from Brisbane, rather than run the risk of losing their men by calling at
Sydney. I have read worse reasons in behalf of better places—but Sand-
gate is not yet the Sandridge of Brisbane.
The natives, as usual, were fertile sources of complaint, and soon be-
came equally so of controversy'. In and close to the towns they stole
what they could ; in the outside districts they both stole and murdered.
In the Burnett District, a Mr. Trevethan, an extensive stockholder, was
killed by them, and many of his sheep driven off. Station after station is
reported as having been attacked with similar results, and on the Pine
their depredations were frequent, and murder sometimes followed. But
in what may be called the reverse side to that which I have had to pre-
sent, it is stated, that at one station on the Burnett, that of the Messrs.
Strathden, the natives were employed as shepherds, and that not a single
sheep was lost; and in the Courier of June 15, in the communication
from its Burnett correspondent I find the following :
“ The inhabitants were lately indulged with an aboriginal fight,
when several were killed, and their bodies roasted and eaten inside of the
town ; Mr. Wilmot, the storekeeper, being the only gentleman whose
stomach was strong enough to bear the spectacle of this disgusting feast.”


It is difficult to say, in this case, who were the greater barbarians,
nor should I insert an anecdote of such revolting barbarity on all sides,
but that I find its truth no where challenged. Additional native police
was called for, and in the same breath their utility was denied. In the
mass of conflicting statement —inference and opinion, he would be a bold
man who presumed to pronounce any certain judgment as to the truth or
value of either.
There is not much to record in the way of the establishment of now
industries. It will be a surprise to some of my readers to be told that, in
this year (1852), Mr. D. 51*Connell attempted the cultivation of wheat at
Bulimba, to the extent of about twenty acres, and, it is stated in the local
journals, got twenty bushels to the acre. Mr. Luinsdcn, of Moggill Creek,
placed in the same year a small quantity of similar grain of good quality
in the liands of Mr. Robert Cribb, of Brisbane. And, in this year, Mr.
Pettigrew is recorded as being engaged in the erection of premises for the
saw mills which first occupied the site of the present establishment. I
road that some news had arrived of the possibility of establishing an Aus-
tralian company for making Australian preserved meats, and that the
Admiralty looked favourably upon the notion ; moreover, the Torres
Straits route was warmly advocated as essential to the interests of this
portion of the then colony. And as, perhaps, a prophetic example, both
of enterprise and failure, a Moreton Bay Steam Navigation Company was
started in April, to run a boat between Brisbane and Sydney. A meeting
was held in May at the old Sovereign Hotel, when resolutions affirmatory
both of the desirability and practicability of the company were carried.
The capital was to be £15,000, in shares of £lO each, no one to hold more
than fifty shares, a half to be paid on allocation, the other half in twelve
months from that time. It was stated then, that the required boat could
be got for £IO,OOO, and that £O,OOO had already been subscribed, and a
committee was forthwith appointed to carry the project out. Ipswich fol-
lowed the example of Brisbane in the way of resolution and subscription.
By the end of August, mure than two-thirds of the required capital were
subscribed for, and it was resolved to proceed at once to allotment. In
October a further meeting was held, when a call of £4 10s. per share was
made, estimates produced, and the usual preliminaries to definite action
gone through. I regret to add, that as became so respectable a prede-
cessor in the way of local communication —for this company was initiated
under the most satisfactory auspices—very early in the following year a
meeting being called, it was resolved to proceed no further, except to pay
necessary expenses. The failure was another weapon in the hands of the
Sydney opponents of separation.
Such an ignominious break-down may have resulted, as was suggested

at the time, from the dissensions between the country and town share-
holders, or it may have been that subscription was more easy than pay-
ment. lam inclined to think that the latter had something to do with it,
for the export for the year showed a very poor increase on that of 1851,
the total being £185,183, and the advance only £4,146. I am now able
to give the export for the six months ending December 31, 1852—from
the Clarence River, £23,850 ; the Richmond, £IG. ; the Tweed, £9OO ;
and the Mary, £10,568. Statistics are valuable sometimes, as indicating
motion, and it is not wonderful that Mr. Wentworth treated Wide Bay
with such indifference—or that when separation became inevitable, the
New South W T alos interests, considering half a loaf better than no bread,
contrived to get the original boundaries between the two colonies altered,
and so kept the Clarence and Richmond for themselves.
There is one important topic upon which I have been most inexcus-
ably silent. It is said that whenever two Englishmen meet, and are at a
loss for a subject, they invariably find one in the weather, and on that I
have said nothing. In its first magistrate and resident, Captain Wick-
ham, the district was fortunate in having a man of scientific and observant
mind ; and I find, that for some time he was in the habit of contributing
what he termed a “weather journal,” to the Courier with regularity—
such omissions as occur not being, I think, attributable to him. Hia
observations comprise the period from 1840 to April, 1850 inclusive, at
which last date they, for unexplained reasons, ceased to be communica.cd,
and I have tabulated them mostly in an abridged form, as perpetuating a
valuable contribution to meteorological facts, and in the hope that some
generous man of science may fill up the interval between April, 1850, and
the time when meteorological observations were officially and regularly
taken, I believe, by the late Dr. Barton in 1859 or ’6O.
I first give the rainfall during each mouth in inches :

The average temperature, as explained by Captain Wickham himself,
he intended to imply “ the register of the thermometer at 9 a.m. in the
shade, which is taken to be a near approximate to the mean temperature
of each day.” The thermometrical observations, it is to be regretted, do
not commence until January, 1847 :
From these records we are able to see that, between 1839 and April,
1850, in three years, 1841, 3843, and 1844, n more than usual downpour


took place, that in 1844 being extraordinary ; and we are not surprised tc
Bud it remembered, that a groat flood took place in Ipswich in January of
that year, and that the country was continuously flooded for a long time,
when the rainfall in December, 1843, and January and February, 1844,
was more than equal to that of all 1840, and 1842, and nearly equal to
the fall of 1846. I trust to be able to connect these observations with
those of Dr. Barton, as we shall then have a table of the rainfall in the
district for a period of thirty-six years, and the deductions to be collected
will be of great value to the colonists in the East and West Moretons, and
the Darling Downs. Further north or west, I fear no records exist up to
the time when the official ones hesan to be taken.

1833—1854.

The petition of the residents of Moreton Bay against the separation clause
in Mr. Wentworth’s new Constitution Bill, met with very contemptuous
treatment at the hands of that gentleman and his supporters. On the
motion for its being printed, in the Legislative Council, on December 10,
1852, Mr. Wentworth, in the scornful and haughty tone he could so well
employ—
“had no hesitation in stating that the express object of the clause alluded
to, was to prevent the separation of Moreton Bay and the erection of that
insignificant depot into an entrepot for the convicts of the mother
country. He did not suppose there could be any question as to the policy
of preventing a few individuals from becoming the tools of the Colonial
Minister, and thereby aiding the stealthy introduction to this colony of
that class of persons.”
Even great talents cannot cover inconsistency like that thus shown
by a politician who had been one of the most prominent advocates of
transportation during the best years of his life. Whether his oratory or
other feelings prevailed most, cannot be even conjectured now, but the
language generally used towards the petitioners can scarcely be described
as other than most insulting, and the printing of the petition was nega-
tived on a miserable technicality by a vote of twenty-six to six. As soon
as information of these proceedings reached Brisbane, a meeting was held,
and another petition adopted on the same subject, to be presented when
the Council should meet again.
There were in those days subjects of mirth, as well as of grave consi-
deration to be derived from politics. The resignation of Mr. F. E.
Bigge having left the electoral districts of Wide Bay, the Burnett, and
I, vnr,. I.


Maranoa, unrepresented, a nomination meeting was called, to be held at
Ipswich, and on the day appointed, the returning officer and three electors
are said to have attended, who were assisted by the counsel of two legal
gentlemen. Mr. E. J. Smith, happening to come that way, held a conver-
sation with one elector and one lawyer, and the result of their delibera-
tions was, that Mr. Cameron proposed, and Mr. Douyere seconded thai
gentleman as a fit and proper person to represent the constituency. Mr.
W. B. Tooth then nominated Mr. Foster, of Wide Bay, but, as there were
only two electors present besides himself, and both were pledged to the
first nominee, he failed to find a seconder. Mr. R. J. Smith was there-
fore declared duly elected. That gentleman, in returning thanks, ex-
pressed himself as determined to perform the duties of a representative
faithfully and assiduously, and said that he only came forward at the
eleventh hour to rescue the electorate from non-representation. It is re-
ported that those present gave three cheers for him. It would not, I
imagine, in so small an assembly, be difficult to secure unanimity, but
how they could maintain the necessary gravity, it is not so easy to con-
ceive. The whole procedure, coupled with the failure of the steam com-
pany, was made good use of thereafter, in Sydney, against the district and
its claims. What sort of feeling there was as to the position and duties
of a member of Parliament, may be gathered from the fact, that the
journals deplored that at the impending meeting of the Council, on May
10, only two out of the five members for the district, were likely to attend
the opening.
This paucity of attendance was the more to be regretted, inasmuch as
it was known that, in that coming session, the New South Wales Consti-
tution would, in all probability, be finally settled for submission to the
Imperial Parliament, and the publication of some very important des-
patches from the Colonial Office rendered the settlement of its terms a
matter of more than ordinary care. One from Sir John Pakington, in
answer to the petition for separation, intimated that the Government
“did not, at present, see, any sufficient reason for separation.” The
second, in reply to a memorial from the Legislative Council of New South
Wales, proposed to concede to the local Government the power of dealing
with the waste lands of the Crown, denying any absolute right in those
lands, on the part of the inhabitants of a colony, but treating the matter
as one of expediency. With reference to the constitution of the Legisla-
ture, the desirability of a nominee Council and an elective Assembly, was
admitted—“ assuming that this is a change as to the expediency of which
general agreement prevails.” Suggestions were made as to the kind of
i civil list which it would be necessary to preserve, and the despatch con-
cluded by expressing a hope with reference to the colony, that the pro


posed measure would “ ocmcut and perpetuate the ties of kindred, affec-
tion, and mutual confidence which connect its people with those of the
United Kingdom.” A subsequent despatch from the Duke of Newcastle,
who, when the Derby Ministry went out, succeeded to the Colonial Office,
in general terms confirmed that of his predecessor.
Somewhat in limitation of the complaints I hare mentioned, Mr. R.
J. Smith took the oaths and his seat about a fortnight after the opening
of the Legislature, and in time for the discussions on the new Constitu-
tion Bill, for the framing of which a Committee of the Council had been
appointed on the motion of Mr. Wentworth. As the Act, resulting from
the Bill, is that by which practically the colony is now governed, its re-
ception and progress may be of some interest. In its proper place, an
abstract of our actual constitution will be given, and I do not propose to
anticipate that, but simply to describe the changes which occurred in the
measure during its progress, and on its final submission to the Imperial
Parliament, as illustrative of the temper which prevailed in most men’s
minds, and of the judgment that was applied to such subjects, at the
time.
Mr. Wentworth still persisted in the clause which absolutely fixed the
boundary I have before described, and which had so disquited the people
of Moreton Bay. But in the bill, as originally laid before the Sydney
Council, was a proposal which, as a curiosity in its way, it may be as well
to particularize. The fourth, fifth, and sixth clauses ran, in their ab-
stracted form, thus: —4. Power to vest in Her Majesty of appointing
Legislative Councils, provided that no minister of religion or judge of the
Supreme Court shall be eligible. 5. Hereditary titles may have a seat
awarded them for life in the Legislative Council. 6. When the holders of
such hereditary titles amount in number to fifty or upwards, the present
Legislative Council to cease, and a Council composed of patentees for life,
and of a certain number of elected persons holding such titles, to be
thenceforward the Legislative Council. There were the usual provisions
as to absence, resignation, insolvency, and other causes by which a seat
could be vacated.
It might be difficult now to find any one courageous enough to bring
forward such a proposal. Mr. Wentworth and his committee —at least
some of them —were theorists of no mean order, and did not lack argu-
ment in support of their legislation.
“Your committee,” they say, “are not prepared to recommend the
introduction into this colony of a right by descent to a seat in the Upper
House ; but are of opinion that the erection of hereditary titles, leaving it
to the option of the Crown to annex to the title of the first patentee a
seat in the Upper House, and conferring on the original patentees and
L*


their descendants, inheritors of their titles, a power to elect a certain num-
ber of their order, to form in conjunction with the original patentees then
living, the Upper House of Parliament, would be a great improvement
upon any form of Government hitherto tried or recommended in any
British colony. They conceive that an Upper House, framed on this prin-
ciple, whilst it would be free from the objections which have been urged
against the House of Lords, on the ground of the hereditary right of legis-
lation which they exercise, would lay the foundation of an aristocracy
which, from their fortune, birth, leisure, and the superior education their
advantages would superinduce, would soon supply elements for the forma-
tion of an Upper House, modelled, as far as circumstances will admit,
upon the analogies of the British Constitution. Such a House would be a
close imitation of the elective portion of the House of Lords, which is
supplied from the Irish and Scottish peerage. Nor is it the least of the
advantages which would arise from the creation of a titled order, that it
would necessarily form one of the strongest inducements not only to
respectable families to remain in the colony, but to the upper classes of
the United Kingdom and other countries who are desirous to emigrate,
to choose it for their future home.”
I can scarcely think that, had the authors of this proposal road the
speeches delivered in the House of Lords in the discussion on the Cana-
dian Constitution, they could seriously have thought that it would ever
pass the Imperial Parliament; but Mr. Wentworth was a man of imperi-
ous character ; and there is something which strongly warps the percep-
tions of men in the intoxication of merely local success. That able
politician is not the only one who, despite of really great powers, finds in
a strange audience the fate of iEsop’s musician.
The suggestion to give another representative for the Stanley Bor-
oughs, and a resident judge for the district, did not reconcile the settlers
to the proposed extinction of their hopes of separate government, or to
the quasi territorial aristocracy which it was intended to make. A nomi-
nee Council in any shape was indeed highly unpopular throughout New
South Wales, and especially so in Sydney, and delay was asked for an ex-
pression of public opinion before the bill was read a second time. All
that could be obtained, however, was a consent, that were the second
reading agreed to, so that the desirability of two chambers could be af-
firmed, the discussion in committee might be postponed for a moderate
period. The feeling in this district against the bill and its author, was in
nowise allayed by his language on the presentation of the renewed peti-
tion for the omission of the boundaries clause.
“ The result of the miserable policy of separation would be the crea-
tion of a federal government, and would inevitably end in the overthrow
of the British throne. If the people of Moreton Bay had a surplus
revenue now, how long had they been a drag to the Sydney Government f
The first thing they should do with their surplus revenue would be to par


their just debts before they Bet up for themselves. The clause in 13 and
14 Vic. he considered to be a degradation of the rights of the colony and
it was the manifest duty of the House to restore the old boundaries.”
It is hardly possible to conceive anger more unreasoning, or argument
more illogical The debate on the second reading of the Constitution Bill
itself took place on August 31, when Mr. Wentworth closed it with the
Last of his great efforts —a speech which is said to have drawn cheers from
all parts of the House, the strangers in the gallery included. The second
reading was carried by a majority of twenty-five to a minority of eight,
and the Council soon afterwards adjourned.
About this time news was received in the district, that the Home Go-
vernment had received the unanimous petition at whose adoption the
advocacy of transportation had been finally abandoned, and that no de-
cision had been arrived at. A public meeting to consider of further
representations to the Home Government, was then proposed; and,
accordingly, on November 5, one described as the largest that had yet
been seen in the district, was held in Brisbane, when men of all classes
were unanimous in their resolutions, and another and lengthy petition to
the Queen was adopted. In support of its prayer, it set forth that, in all,
the revenue derivable from the northern districts was not less than
£70,000 per annum ; that the market value of the stock in them was
nearly £2,000,000; that the freehold interest of the inhabitants was
valued at £700,000 ; that the mineral wealth was ascertained to be exten-
sively distributed, and only needed population for its development, and
that for this a system of local self-government was indispensable. This
was the eighth meeting in favour of separation. At a subsequent stage of
the proceedings, a petition against a nominee Council was adopted, but
destined to have little effect.
The New South Wales Council resumed their sittings in December,
•when the Constitution Bill was committed. Acting, I suppose, upon more
mature consideration of the law and of the course that would probably be
pursued by the Imperial Parliament, the hereditary titles clauses were
struck out, and the one fixing the boundaries of the colony in the event of
separation brought into conformity with the Imperial Act under which
the Council was then sitting. A clause disqualifying ministers of religion
was inserted, and finally the bill, thus amended, passed by a large
majority. It is not to be denied, that the measure thus arrived at after so
much debate and controversy was drawn in a very able manner. Some
few alterations were made in its passage through the Imperial Parliament,
and portions of it have since been repealed, especially those relating to
the suffrage, but in the main it is, as I have said, the basis of our own


Constitution, a short analysis of its principal provisions may now therefore
be advisable.
In place of the one Legislative Council then existing, it substituted
two chambers, the members of the first or Council, being nominated
by the Crown, and of the second, or Assembly, elected by the constitu-
encies created by the bill. The electoral qualification was either the
possession of a freehold worth £IOO, or a household of an annual value oi
£lO, or a leasehold of like annual value, or a grazing license, or a salary
of £IOO per annum, or the payment of £4O per annum for board and
lodging, or of £lO per annum for lodging only ; and the payment of all
rates and taxes, or license fees, that might attach to the property qualifi-
cation was made a condition precedent to the exercise of a vote. The
members of the first Legislative Council were to hold their seats for five
years only from the date of appointment, but all future members sum-
moned after the expiration of the first five years, were to be members for
life, subject to the ordinary provision for the regulation of vacancies-
Any one qualified to vote in the election of members of the Assembly,
was declared eligible for choice to that body. The President of the Coun-
cil was to be appointed by the Crown, the Speaker of the Assembly being
elected by the members. No person occupying a place of profit under the
Crown was to be deemed capable of holding a seat in the Assembly,
unless he were one of the five responsible Ministers authorised by the Act,
or of such additional members not being more than five as the Governor-
in-Council might declare qualified. The sittings of the Parliament were to
be held, at least, once in each year, and more than twelve months was not
to intervene between any two sittings. The duration of the Legislative
Assembly was to be five years, subject to prorogation or dissolution by the
Governor. The minimum number of the Council was fixed at twenty-
one, one-third of the whole forming a quorum. The Legislative Assembly
was to consist of fifty-four members, twenty forming a quorum. Power
was given to both Chambers to prepare and adopt such standing orders
and regulations as might seem advisable, and to alter or re-construct the
Legislature itself upon the vote of a majority of the Council, and of two-
thirds of the Assembly. The control of the Crown lands and revenues
derivable from them was vested in the Legislature thus created, and all
duties and revenues were to form a consolidated fund, out of which the
expenditure of the colony was to be provided, a civil list of £64,300 being
reserved, including £28,000 for public worship. All taxation was to
originate in the Assembly upon message from the Governor, and all pay-
ments on public account were directed to be made by Governor’s warrant
to the Treasurer of the colony for the time being. There were limitations
m to the imount of pensions to be granted, and provisions as to the


Courts of Law, with which, as possessing no special interest for ns at the
present time, I shall not trouble the reader. The Act itself was to come
into force one month after receipt in the colony of the Royal assent to it,
and the first Parliament was to be called within six months from the pro-
clamation of the measure as law. There was one remarkable point in the
bill. Before that time the land revenues of the colony had been in great
measure specially reserved for purposes of immigration: thenceforward
they would be mingled with the rest of the public income, and so, grad-
ually, their proceeds passed into the general routine of appropriation, as
the deficiency in taxation or the temporary exigencies of the public serv-
ice might seem to require. That such a plan might be a great relief to a
hard-pressed Treasurer, there can be little doubt. The equal value of its
operation either on the land laws or the financial administration of the
colony, may be more open to question.
The Act once passed, the interest in the new constitution died out. It
went to the mother country, where, after a rather long interval, it was
confirmed by the Imperial Parliament in July, 1855, in the meantime,
the attention of the residents in the northern districts was concentrated
more and more upon their own local matters. The want of labour was still
sorely felt, although six immigrant vessels arrived in the year, and added
rather more than two thousand souls to the population. There was some
talk of obtaining labour from Victoria, but it resulted in nothing ; mean-
time. wages were high, and the trade of the settlement seems to have been
improving. A new Immigration Act, which was passed during the
session, was expected to effect a great deal in the way of initiating a self-
supporting system ; but it was harsh in spirit and stringent in regulation.
It enacted that every assisted, or free, immigrant, who should not, within
fourteen days after arrival in the colony, have re-paid in full the coat of
his or her passage out, might be indented to any competent employer, for
the period of two years, whether such immigrant consented to the ar-
rangement or not. The employer was to pay half the cost of the passage
at the time of hiring, and the other half at the expiration of twelve
months ; the servant was not allowed to cancel the engagement until a
year’s service had been rendered, and then only if the amount due for the
passage had been fully paid-up. The system soon failed, very few of the
immigrants paying the money, and the forced indenting being highly un-
popular with them—as was indeed only to be expected. The regulations
of the Colonial Office did, to some extent, neutralize the bad impressions
thus created, purchasers of land in the colony being entitled to have
eighty per cent, of their purchase money applied towards the passage of
such emigrants as they might nominate, provided that the rules as to eli-
gibility in other respects were observed. As to those who had arrived in


the district, there was a deficiency in the number of single male adults,
and some difficulty being temporarily experienced in placing out the
families and single females, it was suggested that the latter should be
transhipped to Sydney where there was a great demand for domestic ser-
vants. Captain Wickham, however, was able to dispense with this assist-
ance. There was considerable reluctance on the part of New South
Wales to admit the labour absorbing power of the district, and the repre-
sentations of the Government had an influence with the land and emigra-
tion commissioners, which all the exertions of Mr. Hope and Mr. Leslie,
although vigorously and persistently made, could not quite overcome.
There were still longing eyes cast towards the goldfields of the neigh-
bouring colonies, and much hope was entertained that the visits of the
Rev. W. B. Clarke and Mr. Stutchbury, the Government geologist, would
result in some discovery of note, but the hope proved a vain one. To
stimulate exertion, a number of the residents subscribed towards a reward
fund, amounting in the whole to more than £2,800, to any one who could
produce proof of the existence of a payable gold mining district. Now
and then a strong rumour quickened the public attention—Pikedale, Cun-
ningham's Gap, and the Burnett, all furnished their quota of report, but
in report it ended. In the steady pursuit of less sensational industries,
the settlers found some consolation. The yield of cotton increased ; agri-
culture began to assume something like a definite position, the late Mr.
Donald Coutts, who had purchased Bulimba from Mr. McConnell, being
recorded as a successful cultivator, and raising at the rate of thirty bushels
of wheat to the acre on his farm there. A horticultural society was formed,
and a horticultural show held, which is reported as successful. The saw
mills got into working order. Lemonade and soda water had hitherto
been imported from Sydney, but this year a machine was brought to Bris-
bane, and a manufactory established ; soap boiling, candle-making, and
brewing were added to the industries of the place ; and Mr. T. B.
Stephens saw his way to the establishment of a local fellmougery ; while
ever and anon I note the triumphant tone with which the local journals
record the rise in the value of town property, and of stations in the inte-
rior. The fine station of Westbrook changed hands this year, having been
purchased from Mr. Hughes by the late Mr. J. D. M'Lean, for £13,000 —the
rate per sheep being about fifteen shillings. For Canning Downs £50,000
is said to have been offered and refused. The then restless activity of Dr.
Hobbs brought the dugong oil into notice as a curative agent in consump-
tion, and with some share of success. Whatever might be the opinion
entertained of them by the Sydney people, the residents showed their faith
in their own district by a ready purchase of Crown lands whenever an
opportunity offered. At one sale I read of £15,000 being invested in that


direction—no small sum for so limited a population. Nor did the capital-
ists of the parent colony neglect the opportunities opening to them. The
Joint Stock Bank, the Union Bank of Australia, and the Bank of Austral-
asia, all found their way here, and that it paid them to do so. Moreton
Bay began to figure conspicuously upon the Government estimates ; the
total vote for the year was nearly £25,000 for local purposes, including
£3,000 towards the erection of a lighthouse at Cape Moreton —a vote in-
dicative of the increased importance of the port. Less satisfactory was
the appropriation of £9,139 to the native police. The blacks seem to have
been upon the whole less troublesome. One of them, confined in Bris-
bane gaol, on a charge of murder, contrived to escape, and made his way
to the Maranoa, where he was again caught and brought back. More
alarming to the district, was the news of a desperate gang of convicts who
had escaped in an open boat from Norfolk Island, having landed in the
bay and commenced a new career of robbery and violence. Immediate
and energetic measures were adopted for their capture, which, after some
delay, was effected; and they were tried at the Circuit Court and sen-
tenced to what must have been, in effect, a life-long imprisonment. What
that class of men attempted by open violence, others, and on a much
larger scale, did by fraud ; and what is, perhaps, one of the most impu-
dent deceptions on record, is exposed in the newspapers of the day.
When the gold discoveries in New South Wales had sufficiently stirred the
English public, a Sydney speculator prepared to take advantage of the
excitement. Assuming to be the owner of a large extent of auriferous
country, which had twenty miles frontage to the Hunter River, and was
exceedingly rich in the precious metal, he issued a prospectus of a com-
pany, with, I think, 100,000 shares of £1 each, to work the favoured
locality. He found no difficulty in disposing of seventy-five thousand
shares, and made a bargain that he should be credited with twenty-five
thousand fully paid-up as in purchase of his interest. Of those he realised
£II,OOO worth, and depositing £I,OOO worth of scrip with the directors,
borrowed £2.000 more. Ho then returned to New South Wales, to which
colony he was followed by two representatives of the company, who were
sent out to protect its interests. They soon found that they were ap-
pointed to a sinecure. There was no gold on the Hunter River, and no
twenty miles of frontage available. What they did find, was an unprofit-
able equity suit, and a great deal of sympathy, which did not restore the
lost capital, and merely left them to bewail their own and their friends’
credulity.
The comparative merits of Cleveland'and Brisbane were still debated,
the Ipswich people and the Darling Downs squatters taking most interest
in Cleveland. At this day we look back upon the bitterness with which


the question was disputed with something like wonder, hut the controversy
was waged with great heat then, and as if the existence of the older
township was really endangered. Town allotments at Cleveland found a
ready sale, as indeed did land of every description, and the disposition to
buy was helped by the facilities which the establishment of local land
ofhces afforded. There was some discontent felt at the refusal of the
i nment to hold the Port Curtis land sales at Brisbane, instead of at
n.iey, a great deal of interest being felt in that portion of the country
at the time. Intending squatters pushed out; the Fitzroy was explored
for some distance, and the country declared good, while the beauties of
the harbour at Gladstone were highly eulogised. The reports of the Gov-
ernment surveyors were more than usually favourable, even as to the
capabilities of the soil for cultivation. Some curiosity was excited by Mr.
W. B. Tooth’s bringing into Brisbane samples of wheat grown by him at
Widgee Widgee, and Woonga, in the Wide Bay District—the next to the
Port Curtis one—of whose qualities the local journal speaks well; but I
do not learn that the experiment was followed up. It is, nevertheless,
now that the country in that direction is being rapidly, occupied by
selectors, worth recording ; for what has been done once might be done
again. Westward the township of Dalby was proclaimed, and the little
village of Gayndah began to hold up its head and talk of its central posi-
tion. Cabbage Tree Creek had now become Saudgate ; but improvement
had its perils in those days. Mr. Thos. Dowse and his sons, camping there
preliminary to more permanent occupation, were attacked by the blacks,
and compelled, after some sharp fighting, in which Mr. Dowse was much
hurt, to leave the place.
Altogether, there was no little activity in the settlement about this
time, and promise of what it might, under good government, become.
The exports for the year more than realised the anticipations of the
Separation Committee, who had estimated them at £400,000, the summary
being as follows:
Brisbane River £265,494
Clarence ditto ... 62,559
Richmond ditto ... •" 29,864
Mary ditto 50,796
Tweed ditto 7,508
Total £416,221
The increase in the export from Brisbane was more than £BO,OOO, but - the
bulk of all the trade was still pastoral produce ; the number of bales of
wool from this port alone being 7,968 in the year whose history I am writ-
ing. With so growing a trade the impediments in the two rivers—the


Bremer and the Brisbane —began to be felt as serious hindrances, and
meetings were held, and petitions to the Sydney Government signed, for
a grant of money for their removal. This was refused, but a survey was
promised to obtain data for estimating what the cost would really be.
I have said that the little town of Gayndah began to put forth its
pretensions, but the fact would be hardly worth mentioning, were it not
that one of our foremost public men of the present day, Mr. W, H. Walsh,
made the first entry into his public life, which I find on record, at the
meeting held there to protest against the claims of Brisbane to bo the
metropolis. Those of Bort Curtis were insisted upon with considerable
vehemence—a vehemence which redoubled when the demerits of Moreton
Bay were descanted upon. A petition was addressid to Her Majesty
praying that Port Curtis might be the capital, which, seeing that Separa-
tion itself was at yet far distant, was, at least, taking time by the forelock.
It is amusing to read the grave statement in that petition, that “ the site
of the town of Brisbane is universally allowed to have been so ill-chosen
as to forbid its ever rising into a city of any importance.” Politicians
and historians may well be wary of prediction. Mr. Walsh and his co-
adjutors had been preceded by much_more rash prophets. In the Gentle-
man's Magazine for September, 1786, I read :
“ It has been seen in the public prints, that a plan for forming a set-
tlement in New Holland, for the restriction of transported criminals, is
actually to be carried into execution, but the plan is so wild and extrava-
gant, that we can hardly believe it would be countenanced by any profes-
sional man after a moment’s reflection. Not the distance only, but the
almost impracticability of crossing the line with a number of male and
female criminals, who, in their cleanliest state, and as much at large as
can with safety be allowed them in prison and with frost, are hardly to
be kept from putrid disorders, must for ever render such a plan abortive.
The rains, tornadoes, and heals that accompany these tempests near and
under the line, are often fatal to the hardiest navigator, besides the
mountainous sens that are almost always to be encountered in passing
the Cape and in the latitude which the transports must pursue their
course to New Holland. No man, surely, who had a life to lose, or a
relative or a friend that he wished ever again to see, would engage in
so hazardous an undertaking. . . . Add to these objections that the
natives are the most savage and ferocious that Captain Cook met with in
exploring the coast of New Holland 1”
And yet the Gentleman's Magazine was wont to be considered a
sedate, scholarly, and trustworthy periodical.
The year 1854 was not an eventful one in the history of the district
Complaints of a deficiency of labour became rife once more, and the
usual consequences of such a condition followed. Land was bought only
to remain idle on the hands of the purchaser. Houses were scarce and


rents exorbitant, while skilled mechanics were in great request, and in
some localities not to be obtained. Hope was entertained of an introduc-
tion of Germans, through the exertions of Mr. Lord, of Drayton, who went
to Europe with the intention of initiating a regular emigration from the
German States, but the ultimate result remained to be disclosed. Some
interest, therefore, was felt in the possible success of Dr. Lang’s Moreton
Bay Land and Emigration Company, which he once more pushed forward
with his usual vigour, and with more than his usual discretion. While
in England, from which he had not long returned, he had corresponded
and talked with all classes of intending emigrants, and he brought with
him petitions to the Legislative Council of New South Wales, from a
variety of associated bodies, who, having been informed by him that a
fund, arising from the sales of Crown lands, was available for the assist-
ance of emigrants, desired to benefit by it in payment of the cost of their
passages. He now proposed specially, in the interest of the district, the
establishment of the company I have named, with a capital of £250,000 —
capable of increase, as circumstances might seem to justify—in shares of
£25 each, one half being reserved for allotment in the mother country, the
remaining half to be sold in the colony. Taking advantage of the land
regulations I have before described, the capital was to be applied to the
purchase of land, so that eighty per cent., at least, of the purchase money
should be appropriated to the introduction of immigrants. The profit of
the company, would, it was supposed, accrue from the gradual increase in
the value of the land thus bought. Reputable emigrants, he suggested,
should be allowed to buy land at an advance of twenty-five per cent, on
the price paid by the Company to the Government, but the shareholders
were to be allowed, if they thought proper, to take up land to the amount
of their shares at the cost price. There was a good deal of sound sense
and thorough security in the plan, and it met with general approval here.
He found no difficulty in organising a provisional committee, of which
Mr. James Gibbon, now a member of our Legislative Council, was secre-
tary ; Mr. Macalister, lately Premier, and afterwards Agent-General of
the colony, solicitor ; and Mr. R. D. Somerset, treasurer. He addressed
large audiences both at Brisbane and Ipswich, in speeches in which strong
common sense and vigorous argument were mixed up with, and damaged
by, much unnecessary virulence and sarcasm, but still with great success.
The company seems to have got, so far as preliminaries were concerned,
into something like a workable shape, and in due time a bill for its incor-
poration was brought into the Legislative Council, when a warm debate
took place, which, unfortunately, resulted in its rejection by a majority
of two. Nine elective members—amongst them the late Sir C. Cowper,
Sir James Martin, and Mr. Parkes—voted for it ; the majority was com


posed, with the exception of two, of members of the Government and
nominees. Dr. Lang informed the people of Moreton Bay of the result in
a characteristic letter, more angry than usual in its terms, and therefore
more mischievous in its results.
But in his first election for the County of Stanley, he had had to sus-
tain a struggle which, if experienced by many, would have caused them
to exclaim, in the language of the prophet, of old, “I do well to be angry.”
Mr. John Richardson, who had, from the commencement, represented the
county, having resigned his seat, the most ardent advocates of separation
nominated Dr. Lang, while the squatters and their friends put forward
Mr. Arthur Hodgson in opposition to him. Ur. Lang left the district be-
fore the nomination on April 2-1, and Mr. Hodgson had the hustings to
himself. At the polling, the opposition between Brisbane and Ipswich,
which had been for some time increasing, became more strongly marked,
the doctor, who had a large majority in Brisbane, obtaining only one vote
in Ipswich. The result gave him a. majority of nine ; but, at a later
period, it was discovered that Drayton, on the Darling Downs, had been
made a polling place, although it was outside the electoral boundary ;
and, by some extraordinary process, votes were ordered to be taken there
on May 23—the day appointed for the election in the writ being April 28.
As was expected, Mr. Hodgson obtained the greater number, and the votes
became equal, upon which the returning officer gave his casting vote in
favour of that gentleman. The whole procedure gives one an odd notion
of what could be done in those days.
Dr. Lang petitioned the Council against the return, and the result
was, that Mr. Hodgson was unseated. At the nomination which preceded
the consequent fresh election in August, both candidates were present,
and both spoke at length ; Mr. Hodgson complaining of Dr. Lang’s coarse
vituperation in language still more coarse, and Dr. Lang retorting with
more vigour than grace. At the poll, finally, Dr. Lang was returned by a
majority of one. There was some talk of petitioning against the election,
but it died out; what the doctor complained most of, and I think with
justice, was, that after he had been successful in his petition to annul the
first return, he had been mulct in £l2l for costs—which was the penalty,
I presume, for an unpalatable success.
He was not long in exerting himself on behalf of separation. On
September 18, he moved for an address of the Legislative Council to Her
Majesty, praying for the immediate separation of the Moreton Bay Dis-
trict from the colony of New South Wales. Mr. Stuart Russell seconded
the motion, but Mr. Leslie opposed it, and Mr. R. J. Smith moved the pre-
vious question. On a division, the doctor was defeated by a majority of
twenty-three to seven.


Reverting to the subject of immigration, some slight relief to the de-
mand for labour was aflorded by the arrival, in August, of two immigrant
ships in the bay—the Monsoon, with 394, and the Genghis Kahn, with
474, immigrants. They were soon all engaged, with little perceptible
diminution in the requirements of the district. In December, another
vessel, the General Hewitt arrived with 331 more, who were rapidly ab-
sorbed in the general population. These were all “ assisted " immigrants,
liable to engagement on the terms I have before described, and were not
so well contented with the new system as were its framers, which is not
much to be wondered at. In his speech at the opening of the Council in
June, Sir Charles Fitzroy stated that the Emigration Commissioners in
London found such groat difficulty in carrying that system out, that the
old one would have to be returned to. What was of more present value
to the residents, was an allusion, in the same speech, to the wants of the
district, and a recommendation of a provision for at least some of them..
Such a reference, no doubt, sprang from a visit paid to Moreton Bay
by the Governor in the preceding March. On the 20th of that mouth he
arrived in the bay in the Calliope, man-of-war ; landed at Newstead, the
then residence of Captain Wickham, and rode next day into Brisbane,
where he received deputations, made quiet and guarded speeches, and
went through the tribulations incidental to Governors’ progresses. Thence
he travelled on horseback, by way of Drayton, to the Darling Downs, re-
turning through Warwick and by Cunningham’s Gap to Brisbane, where
he was entertained at what is described as “ the first public dinner given
in Moreton Bay,” and waited upon by the earnest advocates of separation,
and upon both occasions managed to steer clear of embarrassing promises.
After nearly three weeks’ stay in the district, he left for Port Curtis, and,
after a short inspection, returned to Sydney. One good result of his visit,
was the restoration of the old botanic garden to its former use, and the
commencement for it of a career of utility which has gone on increasing ‘
till the present time.
Visitors of lower station, but of greater service, came to the district.
Mr. Moore, the director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney, visited Brisbane,
both to extend his own knowledge and to determine what was required
to restore the gardens here. The Rev. W. B. Clarke, the celebrated geolo-
gist, made an exploratory tour through the Darling Downs, down the
range, and on the lower part of the route to Brisbane. Primarily, his
visit was to ascertain the probability of a payable goldfield being found.
On that head he reports :
‘‘Nothing but the overlying deposits of the carboniferous formation
and the trappean alluvia, which cover nearly the whole of the Darline


Downs District, and, as before stated, the country beyond, about the heads
of the waters falling into the Fitzroy Downs, &0., prevent the occurrence
of a goldfield in the parallel of 28° As respects the lower
regions in the Downs, it is possible for gold to be found here and there,
but, if it is ever obtained in more than inconsiderable quantity, jt will
require far more energy and determination than the talkers about it have
yet exhibited."
There should be encouragement to the old miners in
these observations. On the existence of tin ore Mr. Clarke was far more
decided:—
“ I may, however, remark, that though gold be wanting, there are
gems and tin ore in many localities, of which little account is taken ; but
which may, perhaps, be one day as valuable as gold. Respecting the tin
ore, I may state that I found it in almost every mass of drift in every por-
tion of the country I have explored for gold, and that it is frequently
abundant where gold is wanting. It exists in all the western streams,
from the Peel to the Condamine, and it was equally common in the south-
ern districts.”
It seems odd, that seventeen years should have heee allowed to elapse
before the value of this opinion was tested ; and even then, only to a par-
tial extent.
The land sales went on with unabated vigour. When the Port Curtis
lota were sold in Sydney, there was the usual furore to buy on rumour
what few or none of the purchasers had seen. The prices realised were
very large, many of the town lots selling for £2OO each. One lot of
twenty-two perches brought £270 ; another of thirty-three perches, £370 ;
and another, a little larger, £455. It was calculated that the aggregate
upset price of all the land offered at the first day’s sale, was about £340,
but the total proceeds that day were £9,368. On the second day the
amount realised was £3,497, making a total of £12,865. Cleveland, the
other possible rival of Brisbane,. as it was once deemed, seems to have
commenced its decline —a mercantile firm, which had established itself
there, leaving the place, and the bonded store being removed. In the dis-
trict itself, land was always a marketable commodity. In Brisbane, for
instance, on one day at a sale of town and suburban lots at that town and
at Sandgate—land to the value of £5,136 was purchased. There were
several suburban lots at Bulimba advertised, but withdrawn on a report
from Mr. Stutchbury, the Government Geologist, that coal existed there.
Land seems, indeed, to have been nearly the only opening for the invest-
ment of savings. In 1854, there were no theatres, no musical or public
entertainments, no cabs, but few hotels, and, apparently, little or no ex-
travagance. The surplus earnings of the industrious went into the pur


chase of property, and if, from the want of labour, they could not utilize
that property as rapidly as some of them wished, they at least escaped the
risk of over expenditure, and enjoyed the pleasure of accumulation.
The efforts at what may bo called local improvement, now began to
take a more decided and definite shape than they had hitherto done, and
the criticisms on local and Governmental management became more pre-
cise and stringent. After many applications a road surveyor —Mr. Vigors
—was appointed for the district by the Government. A Savings Bank
Bill was introduced into the Council and passed, and the estimates bore
token that the northern country, as it was then called, was gradually im-
proving in the esteem of the Central Government, as they rose from about
£25,000 in the preceding year to nearly £33,000 in this. A superintendent
for the floating light at the northern entrance of the bay—it is said to have
been a discarded vessel, which had been used for a similar purpose in Port
Jackson —and four light keepers are among the items. The expenses of
the Native Police bore a large proportion to the total, more than £16,000
being voted for them from the Clarence River to Port Curtis. But, ex-
cepting £SOO for improving the town of Brisbane, there was little or
nothing for what might be called public works. These were in anticipa-
tion, especially for the bay and the river. A memorial was sent, praying
for a grant of £IO,OOO towards clearing the bar, and £5,000 for a dredge,
and on November 7, the Governor, by message, recommended that
£15,000 should be so oppropriated. In a reference to the requirements of
the harbour, in a report of the committee of the Legislative Council upon
the state of the public works of the colony, I find the deepening of the
channel described as of “ such importance as to demand the most favour-
able consideration.” The Government Resident here recommended a
further survey, and it was suggested that £I,OOO should be placed on the
estimates, in order that that might be first completed. A jetty at Cleve-
land had been commenced, and to this the committee also turned their
attention. They found that £I,OOO had already been voted for the work,
and that £5,197 more would be required. They, therefore, proposed a sus-
pension of the undertaking until it had been ascertained that the jetty
would afford to the public advantages commensurate with its large cost.
Although of more general interest, still as having a local application, I
may refer to another, although merely a progress report, from a committee
appointed to enquire into the operation of the laws and regulations re-
specting the Crown lands of the colony, in which they embody and
approve of the opinions held by Earl Grey in 1846. In the perusal of
that extract, I can almost imagine myself to be reading a leading article
in a Queensland journal, or a report of the speech of a Queensland mem-
ber of Parliament of the present day.


“ It is obvious,” says his Lordship, “ that if those who now employ the
large runs which are required for the support of considerable flocks and
herds, while the country remains in a state of Nature, were allowed
to acquire a permanent property in those vast tracts of land, there
would very soon indeed be no land of moderately easy access available
for new settlers. I am aware that, under existing regulations, com-
plaints have been made, and not without much apparent foundation,
that a difficulty is experienced by persons, who have accumulated small
capitals, in finding means of purchasing allotments of land of size suitable
to their circumstances, owing to the manner in wh : ch the extensive tracts
have been appropriated by large capitalists. In justice, therefore, to the
poorer class of settlers, I consider it of vital importance, that in allowing
wild lands to be occupied for pasturage, the property of the Crown in
those lands should be effectually protected, so that as they are wanted for
settlement, they may be sold at a price which, while it is too high to
admit of large tracts being obtained possession of by grasping speculators,
is yet sufficiently moderate to throw no difficulty in the way of the indus-
trious settler, who desires to purchase and to improve a farm of moderate
extent.”
I have said that criticism was becoming more precise and stringent,
but it was not so one day before it was required. Two men in the Har-
bour Master’s Department were sent down the bay in a boat, manned by
six blacks of a tribe known to be hostile to the whites. They took with
them a keg of spirits. All that was found thereafter was the signs of a
sanguinary struggle near Sandgate, and the men were no more seen. Al-
though large sums of money had been spent in the purchase of land there,
no one dare build or improve for fear of assaults from the aborigines—
Mr. Dowse, as I have related, having been compelled to abandon the at-
tempt. Roads there were none, and the inhabitants of the two principal
towns were unable to obtain leave to place their streets in a passable con-
dition, while anything in the shape of assistance from Government was
denied them, or, if promised, never forthcoming. They derived little
consolation from the discovery that, however small the profit derived
from the land they bought, those who sold had the privilege of skimming
the cream from what they paid. The commissions paid to the Govern-
ment officers, holding positions somewhat analogous to those of the Crown
Lands Commissioners of our own time, were so large, as at last to attract
the attention of the Executive Council. Between January 1, and Decem-
ber 19, 1851, Captain Wickham received £973 6s. 8d.—£473 more than,
his salary as Government Resident; and Colonel Gray, at Ipswich, be-
tween June 13, 1853, and June 31, 1834, £236 Is. lOd. The public justly
thought that those gentlemen would have been well remunerated by much
less sums for attending two or three hours half a dozen times in the year,
and that the balance might have been devoted to some of the local wants
which pressed so heavily upon them. I forbear multiplying instil, ces,
but I am constrained to say, that in most of the official appointments o£
M VOL. I.


those days, the indirect emolument was often more than the direct salary,
and the public service suffered accordingly. The liberality of the Govern-
ment to its officials at length became limited to a commission of five per
cent, on all sales below £5,000 in one year, and two and a-half per cent,
on all sales beyond that sum. It was worth while being a Crown Lands
Commissioner, in addition to other official functions, in the colony of New
South Wales in those days, the land sales in 1851 having reached more
than £211,000.
The remnant of the exile element and the aboriginal criminality
combined to disturb the generally uniform social quietude of the place.
A brutal.murder was committed at Kangaroo Point, in January, by a man
named Hanley, the victim being known as Stevie Swords. There had
been some drinking, and Swords had left the hut in which it occurred,
when Hanley followed him, felled him to the ground with a heavy
paling, and was seen to strike him afterwards several heavy blows upon
the head. The blows penetrated to the brain. Hanley then went for the
police, and accused one of his companions, who was helplessly drunk, of
the murder. The proof was perfect at the trial, but the presiding judge,
Mr. Justice Dickenson, suggested that “ it might be a matter for the jury
how far Irishmen, accustomed to using sticks in their quarrels, might be
supposed to strike a person about the head without intending to cause
death or grievous bodily harm.” The jury did not seem to appreciate the
suggestion, and found Hanley guilty. He was accordingly sentenced .to
death; but the Sydney Executive commuted the punishment to five
years’ labour on the roads. Perhaps they gave more weight to the as-
sumption of that well-intentioned kind of beating, suggested by Judge
Dickenson, than the jury could be induced to do. Whether they did, oi
not, I have thought the case worth noting as one of the most singular of
those old eccentricities of justice with which the historian of those times
gradually becomes familiar ; and which, in equally grotesque form, do oc-
casionally startle us now.
A more satisfactory instance of the ultimate triumph of the law
was shown in the capture and conviction of a notorious aboriginal of
great strength and cunning, named Dundalli, who, for years past, had
been the terror of the district. In 1845, he had assisted in robbing the
Rev. Mr. Hausmann at Noogan Creek, and in burning his hut down with
the charitable purpose of burning the inmate as well. He was identified
as the murderer of Mr, Gregor, at Caboolture Creek, as one concerned in
the murder at the same time of a woman named Mary Shannon, and as
the actual murderer of two persons, named Waller and Boiler, on the Pina
River. His connection with many other outrages was more than sus-
pected, but the evidence was difficult to collect. He was tried at the


Circuit Court on November 25, found guilty, and condemned to death,
At his execution, in the early part of the ensuing year, a number of blacks
congregated on the Windmill Hill (overlooking the then town of Bris-
bane), to whom he called in his own language with great vehemence, and,
as was subsequently found, exhorted them to revenge his own death. It
seems to have been as if a great burden had been removed from the resi-
dents when it was known that he was really dead. One “ Davy,” another
aboriginal, identified as the murderer of Mr. Trevethan, whose death I
have before mentioned, was also found guilty, sentenced to death, and
hung. There were at that time, two paid chaplains to the gaol, and other
ministers of religion in the town ; but it is related, with the exception of
one visit from a Homan Catholic clergyman, he was left unattended and
uncared for, “pushed up the ladder by the hangman, and precipitated into
death,” as men would hang a noisome beast of which they wished to get
rid. The occurrence caused much comment at the time, and deservedly
so. These executions did not deter the blacks from—perhaps stimulated
them to—further crime. I find two more murders by them, recorded
during the year.
I turn from these gloomy records, which, however, could not, as
characterizing a particular period, have been well omitted, to more cheer-
ful topics. The Horticultural Society of Brisbane held another show,
which is said to have been successful; and an attempt was made towards
the establishment of an Agricultural and Pastoral Association. The Ips-
wich Library and Reading Room took a more definite shape, and subscrip-
tions were readily forthcoming in its support; and, as if the genii of joint
stock companies had been propitiated to the infusion of fresh energy by
Dr. Lang's emigration scheme, the Moreton Coal Company was started at
Ipswich, to commence with a capital of £25,000, in shares of £25 each.
The provisional committee was strong in local celebrities, and Mr. Mac-
alister was secretary, but no locality of operation was indicated in the
prospectus, which seems to have been rather vague in its tenor. Another 1
company was attempted to be formed, for the purpose of working the
mines opened by Mr. Williams, and a few land owners co-operated to try
the strata asserted by Mr. Stutchbury to be coal-bearing at Bulimba.
Coal seems for a time to have been as much thought of as gold ; unfor-
tunately the working of the first was for a long time attended with as
little permanent result as the search for the second. Occasional notices
of cotton arc met with, mostly in the way of experiment and report, but
about twenty-five bales in all were exported, and some samples of More-
ton Bay cotton, having won the prizes offered by the New South Wales
Government, received the further approval of the Manchester manufac-
turers ; hut, as yet, the industry remained within its usual limits. There
M*


were great speculations as to what it might result in, but that was a
speculative period—in theory. I am sorry to have to deprive any of our
local politicians of the least possible claim to originality, and it is with
some regret that I record finding the really first idea of a railway to the
Gulf of Carpentaria in the Australian and New Zealand Gazette of July
1, 1851—the proposers having the usual incorrect notions of our geogra-
phical positions, for they speak of a short line from Carpentaria to Port
Curtis.
The ecclesiastical organisations were getting into active systematic
wort. After long delays, the Anglican Church of St. John was conse-
crated by the Bishop of Newcastle on October 29, and a district associa-
tion was formed to co-operate with the central one at Newcastle for church
objects. The Eev. E. Griffith arrived to take charge of the Independent
Church at Ipswich ; there was a movement made towards the establish-
ment of a Baptist congregation ; the Wesleyans had their usual church
and missionary meetings ; and the Eev. Mr. M'Giuty went on the usual
tenor of his way in earning the good will of his Eoman Catholic flock in
Ipswich, and in initiating subscriptions towards a new chapel for their
accommodation. Turning to more temporal matters, I find that the first
Moreton Bay Building Society ended very satisfactorily, and the share-
holders having received their final cheques, forthwith proceeded to prepare
for the formation of a second.
In the way of exploration nothing was done. The fate of Leichhardt
created some speculation, but no effort. The closing speech of Sir Charles
Fitzroy on the prorogation of the Legislative Council referred to some
scheme for exploring the interior of this island-continent by an expedition
under the Imperial Government, and he expressed a hope that, with that,
a search for the lost traveller would be combined. What, perhaps, more
interested the residents Of Moreton Bay, was the announcement, that with
reference to the examination of the Moreton Bay bar, and other public
works, he, having received notice of his recall, left their initiation to his
successors.
It is to be regretted, that with the quarter ending March 30, 1854,
the usual table of exports ceased for a time, and there exist no official
documents in this colony relating to the years prior to separation. I
gather from the returns published for that quarter, that from the five
districts the totals were as follows :
Brisbane £64,621
Mary ... 14,429
Clarence 9,243
Eichraond ~. ... 9,183 .
Inswich 477


Horses.
Cattle.
Sheep.
Stanley

21,629
84,404
Burnett

18,789
575,815
Clarence ...
2,304
115,812
100,533
Darling Downs ...
3,060
62,600
1,005,200
Maranoa ...
394
27,094
16,700

32,560
400,300
Port Curtis
293
277
7,800
Wide Bay
771
19,259
117,000
Making a total of nearly ninety-eight thousand pounds, in addition to
which there were the cargoes of two ships in the Brisbane, loaded, and
waiting to sail for London, valued at about £50,000. The calculation
was, that the total export in the year would exceed in value half a million
sterling. The general character remained the same as in preceding years.
Of the pastoral wealth of the district in 1853, I am able to give a more
authoritative account from the New South Wales statistics, which were
available at that time about seven months after the termination of the
year to which they related. The total live stock in the districts generally
considered as the probable new northern colony, was as follows :
From the then newly-formed pastoral district of the Leichhardt, no re-
turns had been received ; but the eight districts enumerated contained a
little more than one-fourth of the whole number of sheep in the entire
colony.
Not as directly belonging to the history of this colony, but as con-
nected with it, I refer to the disastrous result of a scientific expedition, in
which Mr. Strange, formerly a resident in Moreton Bay, and Mr. Walter
Hill, the Superintendent of our Botanic Gardens, were engaged. On Sep-
tember 12, the ketch Vision, of fifty tons burden, left Brisbane, having
been chartered by Mr. Strange, who had recently returned from England,
“ for the purpose of searching to the northward for specimens of natural
history The party consists in all of ten persona, and it is pro-
posed at present to proceed as far as Cape York, returning, probably, in
three or four months. Should they be sufficiently adventurous, we shall
not be at all surprised to hear of some rich gold discoveries as the result
of their expedition.”
Thus far the Courier of the 16th of the same month. The vessel ar-
rived at the Percy Islands on October 11, and the next day Mr. Strange,
with Mr. Hill, a Moreton Island black named Deliapy, Mr. Shenks, an
assistant, the mate Spurling, and the cook Gittings, landed to get water.
There they met the natives, and had some apparently friendly intercourse.
Fortunately for himself, Mr. Hill left the party on a solitary excursion,
and was absent about an hour. On his return, he found a naked body


amongst the mangroves, which turned out to be that of Spurling, who was
quite dead ; he next came upon Deliapy, who was hidden in a cleft of the
rocks, and who, by degrees, managed to inform him that the others had
been murdered. Mr. Strange having in the struggle shot one of them.
Only that gentleman, as I gather, was armed at the time. The two
managed to get to the boat, and pulled to the vessel. On proposing a fur-
ther search, none but the master would venture, and, after lying off the
island four days, without seeing any sign either of the natives or of their
late companions, they made sail for Brisbane, where they arrived on
November 14, to narrate their melancholy tale.


CHAPTER X.
1855.
Local Animosities —Sir C. Fitzroy's Recall and Appointment of Sir William Denison—Open-
ing of the Legislative Council —Opposition to Separation in New South Wales—Exertions
of Mr. Wilkes in, its behalf— Immigration—Ecclesiastical Progress—Crimean Patriotic
Fund—The Blacks and the Native Police—Port Curtis—Bridge over the Brisbane —Survey
of the Port—Legal Delays—First Direct Shipment to London—Brisbane Botanic Gardens
—Public Land Sales and Official Commissions —Local Movements —Wool Sales Charges —
Exports—Starting of A. C. Gregory's First Expedition.
The year 1855 was, in some respects, a memorable one in the history of
Moreton Bay. During its progress the local animosities, which had for
some time past been smouldering, broke out into an open flame, heightened
by the efforts of some who hoped to reap their own profit from the dissen-
sion ; by others in the narrow-mindedness that can see no world beyond
the limits of its own circle, and no praise worthier than the little adula-
tion that it can offer for a short hour; and by some who, in pure ignorance,
followed the guidance of those who should have read them a better lesson.
In the face of a formidable opposition to the separation which all pro-
fessed to wish for —an opposition which was certain to tax their united
energies, they began to squabble over the distribution of the good which,
when it did come, it might bring. In their mutual depreciatory vitupera-
tion, the common opponent found argument against their common in-
terest, and I do not doubt that the accomplishment of the desired end
was delayed at least a year by these unfortunate dissensions. They were,
in some respects, the natural result of the old system of government, in
which the central authorities were not only the dispensers of all patron-
age, but teachers of the people to hug their dependence in the hope of
getting their full share of what was to be dispensed ; the nearer the capi-
tal, and the more closely connected with it, the greater the chance of a
satisfactory participation. The combatants for that distinction did not
see that it would take long years, even after separation might be granted,
to finally determine the point in dispute, and that the coarse of trade and
its ultimate development would have far more influence in fixing the per


manent site of the metropolis than the new locality of political adminis-
tration. They had not read the manly and sagacious reply of an old Lord
Mayor of London to James 1., when, in a fit of ill-humour at the absenee
of an expected subsidy, the king threatened to remove the capital. “ Your
Majesty,” said the stout old dignitary, “ will at least please to leave us t/ie
river Thames.” J
Sir William Denison who had been Governor of Tasmania, landed in
Sydney in January, to take the place of Sir Charles Fitzroy, who had been
recalled. Sir Charles left Sydney by the Madras on the 28th. Little or
no manifestation of feeling is said to have greeted him the last time he
traversed the city, where he had represented the Sovereign of Great
Britain for nearly eight years ; and the adulation which, as I have related
in a former chapter, broke forth on his arrival, no longer swelled from
the lips of would-be parasites, impatient for the good things to come.
Something has been written, and more insinuated, as to his personal cha-
racter and conduct, which might have been partially induced by a weak
indulgence to his own family, and was said to have had some weight with
the Imperial authorities from whom, consequently, he received np further
employment. But it would be unjust to draw too authoritative an infer-
ence of that kind, for there were others of higher capacity and stainless
reputation—Sir Richard Bourke, for instance—upon whom the same fate
fell.
Sir William Thomas Denison was a man of a very different character.
Conscientious to the extent of thoroughly carrying out what he believed to
be his duty, not equally accurate in his perception of what that duty was,
or nice in the choice of means to secure its performance, he was quick in
arriving at a decision, dogged in maintaining it when made—unless a
superior authority supplied him with the instructions that stood to him in
the place of knowledge—and impatient both of opposition and opponents.
An indefatigable worker, he meddled with almost every conceivable
branch of government, and sometimes—as in his suggestions as to taxa-
tion—with little benefit to himself or to his Ministers. From engineering
to political science—from political science to theology—from theology
back to the details of administration, his mind was busy, his pen fluent;
but his industry in mastering a subject was less apparent than his confi-
dence in deciding upon it. These were qualities sure to bring him into
collision with those who were entrusted with office in what is called
responsible Government, who, with equally strong convictions, had not
only to consider the expediency of forcing, but to question their right to
force, their own views on a people as free to judge as themselves. He had
never appreciated the condition, so pithily expressed by Sir Henry Bark-
ley, that, in the face of Parliamentary institutions, he reigned, but did


not govern. In demeanour, he was somewhat abrupt, kindly to his depend,
ents, staunch to his supporters, but severe and almost vindictive to those
who questioned his course. Ostensibly almost radical in his political prin-
ciples, he was thoroughly autocratic in his colonial tendencies. Temperate,
moral, and strict in the observance of his religious duties, and charitable
to the poor, his example was, perhaps, more felt than followed ; but his
virtues stood him in good stead with those who looked only on the surface.
The mischiefs that resulted from his defects we shall trace as this history
goes on.
The inhabitants of the district, however, seemed content to anticipate
good things from his administration. Addresses of congratulation upon
his accession to office, were the order of the day. In that from Brisbane,
the inhabitants congratulated themselves on his arrival, dilated on the im-
portance of the district, and solicited an early visit. Those of the country
localities generally followed the example thus set, but the Ipswich one
was more demonstrative. It assumed that “ superhuman qualifications ”
would be required to “ steer between the Scylla of Downing Street bureau-
cracy on the one hand, and the Charybis of popular discontent and inces-
sant grumbling of the colonists on the other,” but modestly stated that
the subscribers would hope for the best under Sir William’s administra-
tion, and believed that he was, “ in short, well qualified to put the rusty
machinery of the present colonial Government to rights.” Finally, it
pointed out one cause of the unhappy differences between former Gov-
ernors and the colonists in the want of sympathy between them. “ Her
Majesty’s representatives have been amongst us, but not of us ; Govern-
ment House has ever been surrounded by a Chevaux-de-frise of conven-
tionalism that has continued to hold the bulk of intelligence and industry
throughout the colony aloof.” I can imagine the grim smile with which
a man of Sir William Denison’s character received this combination of
lecture and confidence.
Having discharged these duties, the people betook themselves to mat-
ters of more immediate interest. Mr. Leslie’s resignation rendered an
election for the district of Clarence and Darling Downs necessary, when
four candidates appeared—Mr, Holt, of Sydney; Mr. Hood, of Talgai; Mr.
Gordon Sandeman, and the late Mr. Thomas de Lapy Moffatt. There was
a good deal of acerbity displayed during the contest; and, before the
nomination, it became narrowed to one between Mr. Hood and Mr. Sande-
man, the others having retired. At the nomination, Mr. John Douglas
made his first appearance in local politics, as the proposer of Mr. Hood,
and met with a negligence, according to the report, which would indicate
that he was not then as well listened to as he usually is now. The final


result of the election was, that Mr. Hood was returned, by a majority of
fifty-six. The constituency of the Maranoa does not seem to have been
well satisfied with the efforts of its representative. A number of the
electors obtained from him an appointment to meet and discuss certain
questions, on which his conduct was alleged to have been unsatisfactory ;
but, when the time came, he failed to attend. A numerously-signed re-
quisition was then sent to him to resign; but, during the year, I find no
trace of any response—a sort of acknowledgement, which produced great
discontent amongst the malcontent electors, but does not seem to have
impaired the good humour of their nominal representative.
The Legislative Council was opened by Sir William Denison, on June
6, in a speech which travelled over a great variety of topics. Education,
local government, the management of roads and railways, steam commu-
nication with Europe, immigration, convict discipline, the administration
of justice with a special reference to the establishment of a permanent
court at Brisbane, the defences of Sydney, marriage and registration bills,
goldfields management, payment for public works by loans rather than by
current revenue ; these formed some of the subjects to which he called at-
tention in a speech described as of the soundest practical character. In
his observations, with reference to railway construction, he advocated a
system which should give an average speed of ten or twelve miles an hour,
“ by employing the material which nature lias placed at our disposal,” an-
ticipating that, by these means, the cost of the roads would be so far
reduced, that in some few years, the number of miles of railway in the
colony “ may be reckoned by thousands.” He certainly had in his mind
the American system, which, in the States, had been in extensive use, and
which, since that time, has been employed with great success in Canada.
The system which was adopted in America in 1855, has been but slightly
modified since for localities whose population is scattered, and communi-
cation difficult; and it is somewhat deprecatory of our usual complacency
on our progress, to find that it was twenty-six years after that time before
we began to think of the practical experience of countries in circum-
stances analogous to those of our own colony, instead of listening to the
theories and judgments of professional men who never once saw these
methods in their working application.
While the Council was intent on discussing these matters, a portion
of the ceiling of their Chamber fell in, and they were compelled to ad-
journ ; but not before a bill for the better administration of justice at
Moreton Bay had been brought in—that object being supposed to be se-
cured by the appointment of a judge, to bo called the Recorder of Bris-
bane, with a primary jurisdiction similar to that of the Supreme Court


(to which a right of appeal was given), and a variety of minor jurisdic-
tions ; the requisite subordinates being duly provided for. On the re-
assembling of the Council, Dr. Lang introduced his bill for the incorpora-
tion of the Moreton Bay Land and Immigration Company, which was
referred to a select committee. Another select committee —one on immi-
gration, moved for by Dr. Lang—was denied, as it is said, because the
right measure had been proposed by the wrong person.
A financial minute of Sir William Denison’s, accompanying the es-
timates, was submitted to the Council, when the singular spectacle was
exhibited of the Colonial Treasurer, moving that the House go into com-
mittee for Supply, being met by the adverse motion from the Solicitor-
General, that both the minute and estimates should be referred to a select
committee. This occurrence has always struck me as a curious instance of
what might be attempted by a power which, believing itself to be right,
was not always careful of the means by which the right might be attained.
Sir William Denison, as I have said, was an autocrat, especially in the
Cabinet, and select committees are more easily manipulated than a whole
Assembly; and, looking to the records of that Governor’s career, I am
compelled to believe that the subsequent interpellations of Mr. Parkes, as
to who really was the leader of the Government, were called for. In these
days no such manoeuvres could be attempted, and no such curious exhibi-
tions be made. Whether the Solicitor-General’s motion was carried or not,
I can find no records within the colony to show, but I infer that it was
defeated from the scattered reports I have. The amounts proposed in the
northern estimates were large, and included some unusual items. For
signal stations between the entrance to the river and the town, £I,OOO
was set down ; £20,000 for a new gaol at Brisbane ; £3,000 for a bridge
over Lookyer's Creek; and nearly £BOO for wages of men employed in the
construction of works for the provision of water for the township of Glad-
stone. But a general feeling seemed to prevail, that the favourite system
of Sir William Denison, local assessment, was carried too far, and that
much was imposed upon that which might have been upon loan. In the
Council itself, a very determined opposition was made to some of the pro-
posals of the Government, thirty-four divisions taking place on a proposed
vote of £12,018 for a volunteer artillery corps. As a placebo to the indig-
nation which Sir William Denison might feel at this determined opposi-
tion, his salary was raised from £5,000 to £7,000 per annum by a very
large majority. A petition from Ipswich, praying that the lands of More-
ton Bay might not be pledged in a general loan for the public works of the
whole colony, was ordered to be printed, and on September 18, Mr. Hood
moved for the sum of £3,000 “ for the purpose of obtaining a survey and
estimate for the construction of a tramroad from the head of the naviga


tion of the river Brisbane, at Ipswich, to the Darling Downs, and thence,
by way of Warwick, to Tcuterfield and New England,” which, however,
he had to withdraw. The Moreton Bay District Court Bill was aban-
doned, to the great regret of the inhabitants, but the estimate for the
Brisbane gaol was carried—the ultimate punishment of offenders being
thus, apparently, of more importance than the adequacy of means to
ensure the justice of their conviction. The last of the old Legislative
Councils, having shown its characteristic obstinacy in refusing, as far as
possible, adequate provision for the requirements of the district, was pro-
rogued on December 17, and on the last day of the year, became a recol-
lection. Henceforth the value of responsible government was to be tried
in the colony of New South Wales. The share of representation allotted
to the north was not very large—five out of fifty-four.
While these events were passing, a vacancy occurred in the repre-
sentation of the Stanley Boroughs, by the resignation of Mr. Stuart
Bussell, which was filled up by the election of the former member, Mr.
Richardson, in his place. The principal argument in his favour, was his
uniform adherence to separation, a question, concerning which the most
lively interest continued to be felt in the district, and which began to at-
tract more and more attention in Sydney. The Empire newspaper, in an
able and temperate article, advocated the principle ; but the dependence
of the residents upon the ultimate decision of the Colonial Office, was
much shaken by advices from England, in which the circumstance of the
previous question having been moved by Mr. E. J. Smith, in opposition to
the resolutions for separation I have described in a previous chapter, was
referred to as exerting a discouraging effect. The Sydney Morning
Herald attempted to show the utter unfitness of the district for self-
government, censuring in very strong terms the apathy of its people as
shown in the failure of all attempts to use their own material resources,
and instancing in most sarcastic terms their inability to work together in
the promotion of even a steamboat company. If I cite a portion of these
observations, I do so in no spirit of reflection either upon the people of
that time or of this ; retrospection may be usefully exercised, and there
have been circumstances, even since separation, to which those censures
of twenty-five years ago might be usefully applied.
“ They have never been able to establish a steam communication with
Sydney, but, as much as they desire to be independent of the 1 middle dis-
trict,' are forced to rely upon a Sydney company to furnish them with
steamboats, and upon Sydney merchants to undertake their whole ex-
ternal commerce. And even when an enterprising public company in
Sydney comes forward at considerable risk to provide the lazy folks of
Brisbane with regular steam communication, they cannot do even so much


on their part as to And coals for the use of their steamers. Their great
staple of wool is endangered hy the presence of a dangerous epidemic
amongst their sheep, and yet they cannot agree among themselves as to
what measures should be taken to check the evil and provide against its
recurrence. A stock insurance company the obvious remedy was
talked of, and went so far as to be organised, but like every similar move-
ment of the kind in the north, it never survived the issue of the
prospectus.”
The local journals met the charges thus made, by insisting that the
want of self-government was the real cause of the apathy thus charged
against Moreton Bay—a reply that was apposite enough at the time.
It was, however, elicited in the Council, that despatches had been re-
reoeived from Lord John Bussell, then Secretary for the Colonies, request-
ing the Governor to report upon the expediency of separating Moreton
Bay from New South Wales, and the erection of it into a separate colony ;
to which the Governor had replied that he would report as directed. The
opponents of the measure in New South Wales at once took the alarm,
and the Herald was the first to assist Sir William Denison in the forma-
tion of his opinion, suggesting that extended municipal institutions would
meet all the requirements of the district; to which a powerful reply was
given by the Courier, in an article, whose merits are such, that I regret
my limits will not permit its extraction ; and there, for the year, the dis-
cussion ended. The principle of. separation was regarded on all sides as
settled.
“ Parliament,” said the Sydney Herald, with regretful bitterness,
“ has even gone so far as to devise a form of government for this colony
in embryo, and no doubt it would have performed the same kind office for
Pinchgut Island, had Lord John Russell made the request.”
The two questions of the dividing line between the old and new
colonics, and the adjustment of the debt, were all that remained to be de-
cided ; the second has never yet been determined; as to the first, the
unhappy local dissensions were availed of by watchful opponents to lessen
the extent and value of the boon when it ultimately came.
I have said that the discussion for the time ended ; but there are a
few figures which may be well quoted, as showing the knowledge of the
subject and the care with which the late Mr. Wilkes—for some years, and
at a critical period, editor of the Ctmriet —went into the subject. Assum-
ing that the districts were united in a separate colony, he estimated the
revenue for 1856, at £120,982 ; the expenditure—allowing for a single
chamber only—£3,ooo per annum for a Governor ; £1,500 a year for a
Judge ; £1,500 for a Colonial Secretary ; £I,OOO a year for a Treasurer;
and for all that was in the Sydney votes as well —he calculated £82,151,


leaving £39,000 available for immigration. The population, from Port
Curtis to the then supposed southern boundary, including the Clarence
and Richmond Districts, he estimated at 20,000. In the year 1860—
the first after separation when our population was 28,000, the rev-
enue was £182,317, the land returns being £II,OOO more than Mr.
Wilkes’ estimate ; the other increase arising from miscellaneous items
accruing from the great activity of settlement then displayed. The ex-
penditure of the year 1860, was £161,000, but £II,OOO was allowed for
that in the Lands and Works Department, bringing the remaining out-
lay down to about £120,000, which, allowing for the greater extent of
country occupied, and the increase by nearly one-half in the numbers of
the population, may be considered as peculiarly confirmatory of the
soundness of Mr. Wilkes’ views. I never had the pleasure of what may be
called a personal acquaintance with that very clever writer; but it is
equally a gratification and a duty to me to pay this tribute to the care,
caution, and accuracy, of which I have given an instance, with which Mr.
Wilkes, during some years, may be said to have led the contest for separa-
tion in the district; and none the less, that when the usual formal com-
pliment has been paid to the “ Press,” the members who have illustrated
its value and adorned its history, are thereupon, and as a matter of course,
forgotten. They may, of all men, apply to themselves the somewhat
mournful language of Edmund Burke —“ What shadows w r e are and what
shadows we pursue.”
Immigration came in more regularly, but yet not in sufficient
quantity to meet the growing requirements of the times. Seven vessels,
in all, arrived from the United Kingdom, bringing about 2,500 souls to
add to the population ; and to these were added a considerable influx of
Germans, mainly through the agency of a Hamburg firm —Messrs. Gode-
froy and Sons. Mr. Lord, who left Moreton Bay for the purpose of
engaging a continuous supply in Germany, upon a special agreement,
found, after he had been some time in that country, that his authority
had been superseded, through the agency of the Messrs. Godefroy’s repre-
sentative in Sydney, and that, so far from that firm co-operating with
him, they were, in reality, acting in direct opposition to his efforts ; his
mission, therefore, was a failure. In all, four German vessels seem to have
arrived in Moreton Bay, bringing nearly a thousand souls. There were
great complaints made as to the victualling of some of these ships, and
the general arrangement appears to have been defective. One of them,
the Aurora, coming into the bay by the South Passage, went on shore
on the sea-side of Moreton Island, where she became a total wreck, but
no lives were lost.
Dr. Lang was active in the promotion of his own scheme, and the bill


for its realisation, as I have said, was introduced into the Council, and re-
ferred to a select committee, who reported unanimously in its favour, and
it passed through its subsequent stages by the assiduous exertions of the
late Sir Charles Cowper. It had been deprived of the energetic advocacy
of its originator through a series of misfortunes which caused great excite-
ment at the time, and on one at least of those subjected to them,
exercised a very melancholy and depressing influence. Two young men,
one of whom was, I think, the sole surviving son of Dr. Lang, were placed
in charge of the branch Bank of New South Wales at Ballarat, Victoria,
and while so acting, it was discovered that a very large sum of money, at
least £IO,OOO, was missing. The two were immediately arrested. There
was also a man named Burcholl, in whose care the bank had been left at
various times, but who was not interfered with, and soon disappeared ;
a circumstance which ought to have directed suspicion towards him, es-
pecially as no trace of the missing money, in connection with the ac-
cused, was ever found. The prosecution, however, was pressed on with
a haste and severity that gave to it a character of unnecessary vindic-
tiveness, and was strongly commented upon in the journals of the time ;
while Dr. Lang, never very reticent in the expression of his feelings,
was more than usually outspoken in defence of his sou. Ultimately,
both the young men were found guilty after a trial which seems to
have provoked no small angry and hostile comment—and sentenced to
a long term of imprisonment with hard labour. The exasperated fath-
er, for some bitter observations on the conduct of the case, was tried
before the Supreme Court, at Melbourne, and acquitted. Subsequently,
Dr. Lang was prosecuted by Mr. Stewart, the manager of the Bank of
New South Wales in Sydney, for libel, arising from a like cause, and
sentenced by the Chief Justice, Sir Alfred Stephen, in an address sa-
vouring far more of the animosity of an offended opponent than the
dignified impartiality of a judge, to six months’ imprisonment—a sen-
tence which, under all tlie circumstances, caused no small surprise and
censure. Petitions soon flowed in to the Governor for a remission, but
Sir William Denison was one of those whose righteous anger against
an offence was in no way diminished by the fact, that the criminal was
also an offender against himself, and he was proof against every appeal.
The doctor offered to resign his seat in the Council as one of the repre-
sentatives of this district, but his constituents, so far from accepting his
resignation, were urgent in remonstrances in his favour. Nor was the
general sympathy with him decreased by the unexpected discovery of the
real plunderer of the bank in the man Burchell, before referred to. A
chain of irrefragable proofs, originating in a chance visit of a well-known
Melbourne merchant and auctioneer to the West of Ireland, and confirmed


by one of the fellow passengers of Burchell on his voyage home, estab-
lished hia guilt, and the innocence of the two young men, who were
shortly afterwards released. In no place was this result hailed with more
pleasure than in the locality of their presumed crime, in which I am aware
—and I speak from personal knowledge—not one in a thousand ever con-
sidered them guilty. Ido not read that any species of compensation was
ever tendered to either father or son for the sufferings to both, which a
more careful and patient investigation at the first trial, and less haste to
secure a conviction, would probably have prevented.
These troubles, however, never lessened Dr. Lang’s ardent zeal in the
cause of immigration ; and it was in the midst of his arrangements for
the full organisation of the new company, that he was called to Mel-
bourne, by the intelligence of the strange discovery, which ultimately led
to the establishment of his son’s innocence. He was not, however, to re-
main without a competitor. Sir William Denison submitted a minute to
the Executive Council, embodying his own views. His scheme referred
only to the introduction of labour, providing for the importation by em-
ployers in the colony of what they might require on a prior payment of
a sum equal to about one-fifth of the expense of the passage, the labourers
to be sent being selected by either friends of the importer, or Government
agents appointed for the purpose. His Executive Council were not quite
as receptive as he was complacent; they would only recommend that the
scheme should be submitted to the Legislature as an experiment, and that
the Immigration Agent should be directed to report upon it. His report,
which was careful and guarded, together with the Executive minute, were
sent to the Legislative Council, and became embodied in that limbo of
suggestions, the annual volume of Parliamentary papers.
The ecclesiastical circles of the district were disturbed this year in the
two leading denominations in the colony. The first interruption to its or-
dinary peace occurred in Ipswich, when certain men, Roman Catholics,
were brought up on the charge of refusing to work on a given day—the
day on which the Feast of the Epiphany fell. The answer was, that by
the doctrine and discipline of the Roman Catholic Church, that day was a
religions holiday on which no servile work might be done. The course of
the bench, before which the case was tried, was arbitrary and irregular.
They insulted the solicitor—Hr. Macalister—employed by the men ; told
him before the complainants’ evidence had been half heard, that their
minds were made up ; treated what was at most a condonable breach of
contract as a criminal offence, and sentenced the men to a fine of 10s.
each, or seven days’ confinement in the cells. The provocation given by
their observations, brought the clergy into the field, and a very acrimoni


ous controversy on the civil and religious rights involved, raged for some
time, greatly to the advantage of the newspapers, through their advertis-
ing columns, hut less to that of theological information or social peace.
I refer to the case simply as an instance of the arbitrary tendencies of
magisterial courts in those days. The relative positions of magistrates and
counsel are somewhat altered at the present time.
In the Anglican Church, a dispute arose among its own members,
which, in its nature, illustrates the changes in opinion which time silently
works on such points. The then clergyman of St. John’s, the Eev. Mr.
Irwin, early in the year, introduced the practice of what is called the
offertory into the morning service. To this certain of the attendants there
objected, and in a meeting—reported as of twenty-five persons—stigma-
tised the offertory as an “unseemly observance:” a reflection upon the
prayer book itself, in which it appears as a part of the service. Whether
the peculiar practice might or might not be regarded as unseemly, the
wrangling which took place was certainly not undeserving of the epithet.
The bishop and incumbent were firm ; the custom took root ; and I be-
lieve, that in every Anglican Church in this colony, the offertory has
become the rule, while in most the payment for seats is exceptional.
While the controversy was going on, a new Independent Chapel was
opened at Ipswich, when it was announced that the congregation “ had
adopted the plan of making all the sittings free, leaving it to each to con-
tribute as God had prospered him." Thus do extremes meet. '
In August of this year, the first steps towards the establishment of a
Baptist congregation were taken, it being understood that the Eev. C.
Smith, of Parramatta, in New South Wales, would probably become its
pastor ; and in October I notice the acceptance of the tender of Messrs.
Jeays and Thompson, for the then new Wesleyan Church in Albert Street,
for the sum of £1,650 ; while £1,310 had been paid towards the erection
of a Roman Catholic chapel at Ipswich. In all this there was activity,
although at times the zeal might be greater than the discretion.
But if I am to judge by the newspapers, the anxieties and interests of
the residents were not confined to matters immediately affecting them-
selves. The Crimean War was then at its height, and the journals are not
only full of the details of that varying contest, and the disasters and mis-
management which, at one period existed, or were supposed to exist, in its
conduct, but the criticisms were as keen, the regrets as pungently ex-
pressed, and the successes as enthusiastically applauded as they could have
been in England itself. And when the Eoyal Letter, recommending to her
subjects the sufferings and heroisms of her soldiers as a just cause for
subscriptions towards the relief of their widows and orphans, was read in
N VOL. I.


the colonies, the response of these districts was warm and free. The duty
of the colonists to subscribe, was insisted upon in language arising above
the usual newspaper level.
“ All the events of this campaign,” said the Courier, “ are such as to
inspire admiration and sympathy, and his heart must be cold indeed, and
hopelessly estranged from his nation, who would not, to the utmost of his
ability, aid the hapless beings who have been left widows or orphans by
the ravages of disease, or the desperate resistance of a fierce and warlike
enemy, against whom our seamen and troops directed their arms at the
command of their country. In no part of Her Majesty’s dominions are
her subjects exempt from tills obligation. The security which has been
given to commerce and trade throughout the British territories by the ter-
ror of the British name, and the adherence of our gallant allies, demands
the gratitude of the Australian colonist no less than that of the British
merchant. Wo rejoice, therefore, to find that Brisbane is no longer to be
left behind in the race of patriotic emulation.”
A meeting was summoned at Brisbane, and immediately followed by
others at Ipswich, Warwick, Drayton, and other portions of the northern
districts, exclusive of the Clarence and Richmond, when committees, who
were working ones in the true sense of the term, were formed. The news
that Mr. Cooper, of Sydney (now Sir Daniel Cooper), had headed the list
there by a contribution of £I,OOO, should have been inspiritive of emula-
tion, and was followed hero by one from the late Mr. W. Butler Tooth, of
£IOO. In all, not including sums paid in Sydney by squatters holding
runs in these districts, £2,570 Its. td. were contributed from the districts
immediately connected with Moreton Bay and Wide Bay, in 1855. Just
at the close of the year, the public enthusiasm reached its height at the
news of the fall of Sebastopol.
“ The Boomerang steamed up to Brisbane this afternoon (December
15) gaily decorated with flags, and having the glorious ensign of old Eng-
land flying over the Russian flag at the peak. The repeated firing of
cannon as the welcome steamer came up the river, the cheers of the crew
and passengers, and the enlivening strains of a brass band on board play-
ing martial and patriotic airs, prepared the inhabitants, who had as-
sembled in great numbers, for the glorious news of the fall of Sebastopol,
which they received with hearty cheers.”
Fortunately, there came no more such sanguinary victories to raise
their ardour ; fortunate for us, if in our own time we have none such at
once to welcome and to mourn.
The blacks and the native police were, as usual, vexatious topics. An
enquiry into the management of the force, disclosed irregularities, which
at one time, threatened its abolition; but the influence brought to bear for
its continuance were too weighty for such a step to be seriously enter-
tained, and Mr. Walker, the former Commandant, having been dismissed,


Mr. Marshall was appointed in his stead. In a short time a sergeant and
six troopers were sent to Brisbane to protect the inhabitants, and to act
as a check upon the natives in the immediate district, a force which was
not, however, uniformly successful in the attainment of the object pro-
posed; and after a few months’ stay, and just as the blacks were becoming
more troublesome, was withdrawn. In the Burnett District the natives
waxed bold and attacked a camp of troopers, killing two and wounding
three; and great discontent was both felt and expressed at the want of
protection to the pioneers in the north and west, while a war of reprisals,
which would necessarily be one of extermination, seemed imminent. Two
white men were murdered at Wide Bay; two more were attacked with al-
most as lamentable results, and stations were robbed and teams plundered,
the New South Wales authorities looking on with the serenity which ex-
emption from danger inspires, not forgetting to see carefully to the assess-
ment on stock, the alleged motive for which, was the payment of a suffi-
cient force to prevent such outrages. The Eev. W. Eidley, a missionary
from the Aborigines Friends’ Society, was not discouraged by all this from
making a long journey to the interior in his endeavours to Christianise
the natives, though it may be doubted whether ethnological science did
not benefit more by his exertions than aboriginal civilization.
In the general progress of the district, there was, as usual, more of
suggestion for the future than positive advance in the present. Some
slight dispute arose over the speech of Mr. Hodgson, at a farewell dinner
given to him in January, previously to his departure for England. He
was eloquent on the rights of the squatters, inferring from the Orders-in-
Council, that they had acquired a sort of prescriptive permanency of
tenure in the lands they held under lease—a notion advocated with great
pertinacity at the time in New South Wales and Victoria, although it had
been fully controverted by the late Duke of Newcastle, in his celebrated
despatch of November 23, 1853. But he went still further, and asserted
the utter uselessness of the greater part of the country for anything else
but pastoral purposes.
“ Take, for instance,” said he, “ that immense tract of country known
as the Darling Downs, which feeds nearly one million of sheep, exclusive
of cattle and horses—who would be mad enough to attempt cultivation
there ?” “If it were practicable, do you think that we would not one and
all grow wheat for our own consumption ?”
“ Time will not fail to arrive,” said the Courier, in reply, “when the
Darling Downs will become as famous for their agricultural produce as
their wool,” and time has undoubtedly proved which was the truer pro-
phet of the two twenty-six years ago. There was more excuse for Mr.
Hodgson in 1855 than for Mr. Anthony Trollope’s foolish dictum, “ They
s*


can't grow wheat in Queensland.” The Horticultural Society’s exhibi-
tions proved even, in the year of which I am writing, that fruit and vege-
tables could be successfully grown on the Downs, and both the soil and
climate were more favourable to the cultivation of those cereals, which
had flourished under less favourable conditions in the vicinity of Bris-
bane.
The Port Curtis settlement declined in popularity. The land sales
fell off, and a sharp attack, made by Mr. Burkes, both on the place and
its cost, drew more attention to the settlement than acquiescence in its
utility. A select committee of the Legislative Council, appointed to in-
quire into the question, brought up a report which, on debate, was
affirmed as to the following resolutions :
“ That the* appointment of a Government Resident at Port Curtis by
Sir Charles Fitzroy, was an error, which has already involved the colony
in a loss of several thousand pounds without any determinable public
benefit:
“ That the appointment of a Police Magistrate to the town of Glad-
stone would be a sufficient provision for securing the ends of j ustioe and
the preservation of order at Port Curtis under present circumstances :
“ That supposing this change was immediately effected, the capabili-
ties of the district would have an equal chance of development, and the
progress of the port would be in no respect retarded.”
The Port Curtis establishment had, up to the date of the report in
1855, cost £22,535. The land sales had realised £16,729, and there
seemed little prospect of further increase of population ; but with the
report, I believe, the matter so far ended. Some compensation was sup-
posed to be in store for this, by the setting apart of two village reserves
on the road from Ipswich to Drayton—Alfred and Gatton—which re-
mained villages—on the map—for some years afterwards.
The residents of Moreton Bay were not unmindful of its wants, al-
though somewhat antagonistic as to their respective nature and exigency.
The people of Brisbane began to talk about a bridge across the river, con-
necting the north and south sides. The first notion was to form a sort of
pontoon bridge, sufficiently high to admit of river craft passing under the
platforms, and to float a company for its construction. After about a
month’s consideration, a meeting was held, at which it was stated that a
capital of £IO,OOO would be sufficient for the construction of such a pas-
sage way, and a return of £I,OOO a year might be calculated upon, on
which the inevitable committee was appointed. The Governor was ap-
pealed to, when it appeared that he disapproved of the bridge, and
suggested a steam ferry. A week’s consideration of this, allowed the en-
thusiasm to cool considerably, and the end of the year simply left a


record of one of those numerous commencements which marked the
history of enterprise in Moreton Bay.
However this apathy might be deplored,'the people could unite in
welcoming the arrival of Mr. Grundy, an engineering surveyor, employed
by the Sydney Government to make the necessary survey of the river bar,
in order to ascertain the practicability and probable cost of deepening the
channel. Sanguine anticipations of the advantages that would follow
were indulged in. “ The survey is to be commenced immediately, and
when, aided by the practical skill of His Excellency the Governor-General
as an engineer, will set at rest, and, no doubt, favourably, a question of
vast interest to the district.” It is necessary here to mention, in explana-
tion, that in reply to a memorial to Sir William Denison, respecting the
sites of public buildings, he had intimated his intention of visiting the
district and deciding upon them himself—a sort of interference with the
responsible executive, which he did not find so practicable as it no doubt
seemed to him necessary. Towards the close of the year it was announced
that other proposals than those suggested in Mr. Grundy’s report, had
been laid before the Governor, and that the consideration of the whole
matter would be deferred until he had had an opportunity of making a
personal inspection of the locality.
The Winter Circuit Court afforded fresh cause of discontent with the
people. It was officially appointed to be held on May 21, but the Austra-
lasian Steam Navigation Company having detained the only steamer
available, the Bench and the Bar did not arrive till the 25th, and plaintiffs,
defendants, jurors, and witnesses were kept dancing attendance fruitlessly
during the week. The advocates of separation found in this circumstance
a new argument in favour of independence. A case at Ipswich strength-
ened them in their convictions. Mr. Gill, a storekeeper in that town, had
been convicted before the local board, of using threatening language to
Mr. W. H. Gray, and sentenced to a fine of £5, with the alternative of
three months' imprisonment. The language complained of formed part of
a wordy war in Mr. Gill’s own shop, and not in any public place or
thoroughfare. Mr. Gill appealed to the Supreme Court in Sydney, when
the conviction was quashed, but he had his own costs to pay, a result
which proved that, in some cases, immediate oppression is dearly got rid
of by distant justice ; and the inference in favour of a local court was ir-
resistable. As to the Circuit Court itself, beyond the annoyance caused
by its delay, there was nothing worth noticing about it.
There was more room for congratulation in the established practica-
bility of direct shipment from Brisbane to London. The Gazehmnd —a
vessel carrying about 600 tons of cargo—was loaded at the Messrs. Baff’i


wharf, fitted and found for sea, and successfully crossed the bar without,
as it was triumphantly said, the aid of a steamer. The port of Moretou
Bay had already found notice in the Liverpool and London shipping lists,
and it began to be hoped, that to Brisbane itself, a similar distinction
would soon be accorded. The capabilities of the river—at one time scorn-
fully stigmatised as a ditch—were now not only admitted, but the claims
of the Bremer, at any rate, to the “ head of navigation,” as Ipswich began
to be called, were put forward. This year may also be distinguished as
the first in which direct shipment from a Brisbane wharf to a British
port, and in a full-rigged ship, was proved to be practicable. The achieve-
ment drew fresh attention to the defective arrangements for lighting and
pilotage. Whether a buoy-boat, or light-ship, or a pilot were'wanting,
local knowledge and requirements were equally overlooked by the Sydney
authorities. A pilot being required, applications were called for—and, in
due time, notices were issued to the applicants to attend at the Harbour
Master's Office, in Sydney, on a given da}’-, the notices reaching Brisbane
on the day fixed for attendance. The person ultimately appointed, was a
comparative stranger, and knew nothing of the river. channels, his chief
recommendation being, apparently, that he had lost a ship in the bay.
There was some occasion for the sarcastic local recommendation, that, if
ever a new iron lighthouse, said to have been - ordered for Moreton Island,
did arrive in Sydney, it should forthwith be appropriated there, and some
old worn-out grate sent from Newcastle or Port Jackson instead. Ido
not know whether this principle was applied in all local appointments;
but, I notice, that this year the district first had the benefit of the services
of a resident clerk of works. About the same time, Dr. Kemball was ap-
pointed Immigration Agent, and the late Sir E. E. Mackenzie, Mr. Dun-
can, and Mr. T. Jones, a committee of management for the Botanical
Gardens, of which Mr. Hill was placed in charge as superintendent. The
committee may be presumed to have been laudably anxious for the pre-
servation of their trust, for they locked the gates against the public on
Sundays, at wdiich the public were very reasonably discontented. A local
committee was also appointed for the management of the Savings Bank;
and although its operations were hindered, in consequence of delay in the
appointment of an accountant, it did not prevent the military ardour of
the people from finding vent in the formation of a Brisbane rifle corps.
The sales of public lands, when held, met with the usual response of
ready buyers. One return gives the proceeds, during fifteen months, from
April 1, 1851, to June 30, 1865, at Brisbane, at £25,347 ; at Ipswich,
£14,355 18s. During the period, from July 31, 1854, to June 30, 1835
eleven months—the commissions paid to the officers managing the sales at
the two places, were, to Captain Wickham, £1,156 Bs. Id., and to Colonel


Gray, £B5l 15s. 7d. Thus, the income of the then Government Resident
at Moreton Bay, was more than that of the Premier of Queensland now,
and of the Police Magistrate at Ipswich equal to it. These kinds of
indirect official emoluments were of the sort that—
“ Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame. 1 ’
A slight movement was made towards a petition for the incorporation
of Brisbane, the lamentable condition of the streets and roads rendering
some measure of local self-preservation desirable, but beyond discussion,
nothing appears to have been done to provide for a traffic which must
now have been considerable —the annual tolls on the femes having sold
for £3OO. In local industries, there was not much attempted. Now and
then I see a notice of new coal discoveries, but the hope of gold had died
out; and, except in society meetings of various kinds, there was little local
activity. In one respect, the year exhibited a novelty in the shape of the
first really enjoyable public entertainment given in the colony. The cele-
brated violinist, Miska Hauser, visited the district, which rose, as it were,
at the music he produced from his instrument, and went wild with delight
at tke unaccustomed strains. Minor performances followed, but none ob-
literated the recollection of the effect produced by that exquisite player.
Less pleasant is it to record, that Mr. Pettigrew’s saw mills were burnt
down on July 11, the fire being chronicled as the first serious one in Bris-
bane. Much sympathy was felt for the owner, and an immediate sub-
scription entered into to help him in their re-building. Later in the year,
I find the erection of a similar establishment near Ipswich, by Mr. Flem-
ing, recorded; but, on the whole, local industries seem to have been
confined in their application to local requirements. In that view we may
regard the establishment of the first Ipswich newspaper—the North
Australian —the first number of which was issued on October 2 of this
year. I have a vivid recollection of the pungency and bitterness of the
articles it occasionally contained some four years after this period ; but
such was the hold of the public press upon the public affections in this
district, that I have not been able to find a single copy of the paper itself
prior to its removal from Ipswich to Brisbane.
There were some circumstances of especial interest to those readers of
this history who may happen to be engaged in pastoral pursuits, which
should make this year memorable to them. In the wool market a ques-
tion unexpectedly arose, mooted by the buyers, with respect to the allow-
ance of “ draft,” in addition to tare. On the London market a deduction
of 1 lb. per cwt. had been always made in addition to 10 lbs, per bale for
tare ; in the Sydney market the 10 lbs. tare had been the only allowance.
At a meeting of the buyers in Sydney, a resolution was carried, “ that the

London allowance of 1 lb. per cwt. be demanded on all wools purchased
at auction or otherwise, and also on actual tare, not less in all cases than
10 lbs. per bale.” Mr. H. Mort stigmatised the London practice as ini-
quitous, and protested against the resolution ; but, as he was the only
dissentient, the resolution was carried, and ultimately, from the combina-
tion of the buyers, had to be submitted to. As the question at issue in 1855,
has been recently one of acrimonious dispute between the producers and
brokers in London, I thought its origin in the New South Walei market
worth recording. Another circumstance, which occurred here, led to an
alteration in the law relating to diseases in sheep. Early in the year, Mr.
Tamm, a well-known importer of merino sheep, had landed a number of
rams of considerable value, which he intended to sell to the stock owners
of the district, and while absent on that business, the disease called scab,
broke out amongst them. The whole were, under the then existing law,
destroyed, and the only compensation available for him when he returned,
was the sum of four shillings per sheep, each of which were worth from
twenty to thirty pounds. This was felt as a great injustice, and likely to
be a hindrance in the way of improvement. A clause in the new Act,
therefore, provided for such cases. Imported animals were to be inspected,
and if supposed to be diseased, were to be shorn and dressed, and not to
be removed from the place when landed until reported to be cured.
Many alterations have since been made in the details of the law, but this
was the first discriminating legislation on the subject.
At the close of the year, the old plan of publishing the returns of ex-
ports, so far as they were available, was resumed, but, it is to be regretted,
only for its last quarter. This however, will be enough to show the
increase in the trade of the northern ports. The totals stood as follows:
The export from Brisbane alone, for the last quarter of 1855, vyas
about equal to the whole yearly trade of the northern districts six years
before, a fact not to be forgotten hereafter ; but its character remained
the same—pastoral produce, principally—and I find no mention of cotton.
The tonnage of shipping inwards, to Moreton Bay, was 9,237 tons.
To complete the year’s history, I have only now to refer to what may


be called tbe initiation o£ Mr. Gregory's first exploratory expedition.
Flying rumours had been heard of tracks of Leichhardt, though none had
been found to possess any substantial foundation; but his friends seem
to have hoped that -were another expedition sent to the north, some-
thing might possibly be found of his route had he survived, far beyond
the point reached by Mr. Hely. The discovery of country on the north-
west coast and interior that might be available for connecting the colonies
of Western Australia and South Australia with our own coast line and set-
tlements, seems to have been the leading idea in the mind of Sir William
Denison, to whom sentimentality of any kind was unknown, and who pro-
bably thought that Leichhardt had been lost long enough to leave his
fate no longer a matter of uncertainty. When the expedition was deter-
mined on, Mr. A. C. Gregory, afterwards, and for many years, Surveyor-
General of this colony, and at that time known as a successful traveller
and explorer in Western Australia, was appointed to take command of it.
It was proposed to complete the equipment of the party at Moreton Bay,
whence the necessary vessels were to sail for the mouth of the Victoria
river, on the north-west coast of Australia, and then disembark on their
perilous voyage. Mr. H. Gregory, a brother of the leader, arrived in
Brisbane in April, for the purchase of horses, and to make other necessary
arrangements, and in July the necessary official instructions were handed
to Mr. Gregory himself. These directed him, after disembarkation, to
penetrate inland in a southerly direction, by such a course as might seem
most advisable, in order to obtain as extensive a knowledge of the north-
west interior as was possible, taking note of the geographical features,
the habits of the natives, and generally of such natural characteristics of
the country and its inhabitants as might be turned to future advantage.
If a navigable river, debouching on the north-west coast, were found, its
outlet was to be examined, and the facilities presented by it for navigation
ascertained. In the next place, a connection was, if practicable, to be
established with the former route of Sir Thomas Mitchell on the Victoria
river; or, if that were found impossible, Mr. Gregory was directed to
attempt the discovery of a more direct line than that of Leichhardt’s to
the eastward, so as to connect the settlements on the east coast with the
Gulf of Carpentaria—meeting one of the vessels at any point of rendez-
vous he might fix upon. Not one reference to Leichhardt’s possible fate,
or to its ascertainment, occurs in the instructions ; and the general ones
are of the usual nature.
The arrangements being complete, the Monarch and Tom Tongh left
Sydney on July 18, and anchored in the bay on the 23rd ; and on August
12, having got all the equipment and stores on board, they sailed for the
north. As its main interest belongs to the following year, I defer the


complete history of the expedition to the proper place in the following
chapter. I say complete, because Mr.. Gregory has, with great kindness,
placed his journal at my disposal for use in the compilation of this
narrative.*
* This gentleman—not one of the least abused in this colony—has had the honor of
C.M.G. conferred upon him for his geographical explorations and servic s to science
generally. Thus, a prophet has honour, etc.—but the quotation is trite.


CHAPTER XI.
1856.
Initiation of Parliamentary Government in New South w ales —First Responsible Ministry in
Australia —Ministerial Changes—The Separation Movement —Sir Win, Denison's Adverse
Report — Mr. Labouchere and Mr. Hodgson — Mr. Darrall's Intemperate Language—Im-
perial Determination in favour of Separation—Attempt in New South Wales to retain the
Clarence and Richmond River Districts — Mr. E. Deas Thompson's Recantation — Indus-
trial Progress—Harbour Improvement—Captain Touns and Decency of Burial—A. C.
Gregory's First Expedition ,
The initiation of elective Parliamentary Government was the first public
business of the year; the elections to the new Legislative Assembly re-
quired immediate attention, and the people of the Moreton Bay district
were not slow in preparing for the exercise of their privilege. For the
Stanley boroughs Mr. H. Buckley was first requested to stand, but a tech-
nicality arising from his having sat in the Revision Court for that elect-
orate, induced him to withdraw, and to contest the seat for the Stanley
county instead, where he found an opponent in Mr. W. M. Dorsey. For
the boroughs, which returned two members, Mr. Richardson, the former
member, Mr. F. A. Forbes, Mr. A. Macalister, and Mr. T. Holt, a Sydney
Merchant and capitalist, were candidates. Mr. Gordon Sandeman was
solicited to accept the suifrages of the Burnett, Wide Bay, and Maranoa.
Mr. Clark Irving and Mr. Colin Mackenzie stood for the Clarence and
Darling Downs. There was no variety of opinion expressed as to the
question of separation or of convictism ; but on the other subjects on
which differences might exist, there were several shades apparent, and
some little equivocation employed. The programme of Messrs. Richardson
and Forbes might be described as ultra-radical on the questions of edu-
cation, State-aid to religion, the constitution of the Legislative Council,
the suffrage, the ballot, and the duration of Parliament. Mr. Macalister
was what would now he considered as a tolerably well pronounced con-
servative. Ho objected to a nominee Council, and to the two-thirds
clause restrictive of alterations in the Constitution ; he was urgent upon
the necessity for a cheap system of tramroads, to take the place of


common roads ; he advocated selling the public lands by auction, but
was in favour of a reduction of the upset price, observing that the
general question in its various relations “must be met in a spirit of
equity, and while doing no damage to any special interest, be made to
advance the general interest of the colony”—language vague enough to
avoid criticism and leave action free. The national system of education
he regarded as to be applied to “ remote and very scattered districts of
the colony,” adding, “ but as I am strong in the belief that education
ought always to have a religious foundation, I should, where such is
practicable, be favourable to the establishment of denominational schools.”
And on the great question of State-aid to religion, he expressed a decided
opinion that the Legislature of a country may offer voluntary contri-
butions for religious purposes equally with individuals, and [l] “ have
therefore yet to be convinced of the propriety of withdrawing the sup-
port now given to ministers of religion.” It is curious and not uninstruo-
tive to trace the political beginnings of men, who in a lengthened
political career, have exercised a leading influence on the course of public
events, and in that view I have thought these early political utterances
of Mr. Maoalister worth recording. Mr. Sandeman, in reply to the
requisition sqnt him, pointed with some pride to the fact that in the
district he was asked to represent, he “ was the earliest settler,” and he
dealt naturally with topics upon which his neighbours and possible con-
stituents were most immediately interested:—the management of the
native police, the local administration of justice, and the fair distribu-
tion of the revenue in the improvement of roads and bridges. He ob-
jected to the purely nominee element in the Legislative Council, for
which defect he hoped some remedy might be found in the Constitution
Act itself. Mr. Holt was vehemently protesting in a profusion of italics
and capital letters. On local wants he would be guided by local wishes ;
on education he expressed similar opinions to those put forth by Mr.
Macalister ; and, regarding “ prudent habits ” as part of public educa-
tion, put in a word for the Australian Mutual Provident Society, of
which he claimed to be the founder. He advocated the resumption of
leased waste lands on compensation to the lessee ; an elective Upper
House, because the majority of the people were opposed to nomineeism ;
and the repeal of the two-thirds clause. I should say that there was a
good deal of vivacity about Mr. Holt’s candidature on the part of the
candidate and his supporters.
The election for the boroughs was carried on with no small acerbity
and soon resolved itself into a question of Brisbane against Ipswich.
When the poll closed it was found that Mr. Holt and Mr. Eichardson were
returned by majorities of two to one over their competitors, Brisbane


almost to a man polling for them, and Ipswich for their opponents. In
the county, Mr. Buckley polled 305 to Mr. Dorsey’s 100, Mr. Sandeman
was returned without opposition, and Mr. Clarke Irving, mainly through
his influence in the Clarence and New England districts, defeated Mr.
John Mackenzie. Mr. Macalister, in rather an angry address, attributed
his defeat to the treachery and tergiversation of his supposed Brisbane
supporters.
Before the elections Mr. E. Deas Thompson had returned from
England, which he had visited on leave, and to the duties of his office as
Colonial Secretary, it being understood that both he and his colleagues
held office only until there was an opportunity of selecting a Ministry
from the new Parliament. In due time the Legislative Council was con-
stituted, the three judges of the Supreme Court being amongst the
members, and the Chief Justice the President; the roll of elected
members completed; a new Ministry formed; and the great game, of
what I can scarcely regard as other than political see-saw, began. The
first Ministry was—Mr. S. A. Donaklson, Premier; Mr. Mao Arthur,
Colonial Treasurer ; Mr. W. M. Manning, Attorney-General: Mr. Darvall,
Solicitor-General; and Mr. Nicholls, Auditor-General —a combination not
very likely to be favourable to the claims or interests of Moreton Bay.
The bulk of the old leading officials found a dignified retirement on the
cushions of the Legislative Council.
Prior to the opening of the new Parliament, and on May 7, a meeting
was summoned at his residence by Mr. D. Cooper, to consider the course
to be pursued by what were by implication to be considered as inde-
pendent members of the Assembly, and after seven hours’ consultation
they seem to have arrived at a determinate course. On the 22nd the
House met formally, when Mr. Cooper was elected Speaker by a majority
of one over Mr. Parker, the Ministerial candidate. The next day the
Governor opened Parliament in state, much to the admiration, and some-
what to the amusement, of spectators unaccustomed to such a ceremony.
On the usual address in reply to his speech being moved, it was met by
an amendment, affirming that the former Executive were not entitled to
their pensions under the Constitution Act, until relieved from office by
Parliamentary action, and that the assumption of the position of respon-
sible Ministers by the members of the new cabinet was premature and
unconstitutional. On these questions the Ministry obtained substantial
majorities. Mr. Maoarthur almost immediately resigned the Colonial
Treasurership, which was taken by Mr. Holt. Dr. Lang forthwith
addressed a letter to the electors of the Stanley boroughs, warning them
that if separation in any form were to meet with the slightest support
from a cabinet, which he stigmatised- as a “ repetition of the old sham


under E. Deas Thomson & C 0.,” it would only be on condition of retain-
ing for New South Wales the Clarence and Eichmond Elver districts.
This warning, however well founded subsequent events proved it to be,
fell on deaf ears, and Mr. Holt was re-elected on June 23, without
opposition, to a short and troubled ministerial career. On August 12 a
motion by Mr. Forster, condemnatory of the presence of the judges in the
Legislative Council, was carried against the Ministry by the Speaker’s
casting vote. On the 14th Mr. Donaldson moved that the vote be re-
scinded, but was defeated by a majority of one. Subsequent divisions
on leading questions leaving the Ministry in scarcely any better position,
they resigned, and were succeeded by one of which Mr. Cowper was
Premier, having Messrs. Campbell, Murray, Martin, and Mr. A. J. P.
Lutwyche (the late Mr. Justice Lutwyche) for his colleagues. No sooner
had the new Ministry been re-elected, than they were met by a vote of
want of confidence, which was carried on September 24, by a vote of 26
to 24. On this they resigned, when a third cabinet was formed—the
third in four months—Mr. Parker being Premier, with Mr. Donaldson as
Treasurer, Mr. Hay as Auditor, Mr. Murray as Attorney-General, and Mr.
Darvall as Solicitor-General; and with this change the end of the year
found the Parliament apparently acquiescent, if not satisfied. In every
point of view the new Ministry might be considered as inimical to the
separation of the northern districts from the parent colony.
Indeed the year was one of continuous excitement on the subject.
The reference of the matter to Sir William Denison by the home
Government excited some uneasiness, and a public meeting was held on
January 22, at which a fresh petition to the Queen —drawn with great
ability by Dr. Lang—was adopted, in which the resources of the district
were set forth at some length, and the neglect which it had suffered from
was enlarged upon in strong but not unjustifiable terms. It alleged that
the export from the northern districts was one-eighth of the total of that
of New South Wales ; that their area was equal to the united areas of
eight of the minor British colonies, all of which enjoyed independent
government; and that neither South Australia or Van Diemen’s Land
was equal to Moreton Bay when they had that right conceded to them.
It is to be regretted that the language used at the meeting towards Mr.
E. Deas Thomson was ill-timed and discourteous. Mr. Thomson, as it
afterwards appeared, had, so far from opposing separation when in
London, given his assistance to the then Secretary of State for the
Colonies, Mr. Labouchere, in the determination of the boundary-line
between New South Wales and the new colony, which was fixed at the
30th parallel, so as to include the Eichmond and Clarence River districts.
Undoubtedly Dr. Lang rendered very great service in the cause of


separation ; and it is therefore the more to be lamented that anything
should have resulted, even indirectly, from his vehemence to mar the
success already sure of attainment, or interfere with the completeness of
the detailed arrangements.
There was greater reason for regret, since it soon appeared that the
opponents of separation were both active and insidious. The jealousy
felt towards Brisbane by the outlying districts, and the rival claims of
Ipswich to be the future capital, were sedulously fostered by those who
desired nothing bettor than to see such a disunion between the
inhabitants as would give them, at least, some technical hold against the
creation of a new colony. Some of the inhabitants of Grafton, on the
Clarence River, were induced to meet and petition against the separation
of that district from New South Wales, and this was followed up by
another meeting at Tenterfield, in New England. There was no question
as to by whom, or why, these meetings were got up. One thing to be
regretted is that the people of the more populous districts of the then
North were not more active and conciliatory to their southern neigh-
bours in securing the goodwill of those whose co-operation was so
essential to the common good.
The necessity for this should have been more apparent, when in June
the Government Resident informed the memorialists to a preceding
petition that Her Majesty’s Government had resolved, for the present, to
“ abstain from any measures for the purpose of separation,” this resolution
having been formed presumedly on the Governor-General’s report. The
presumption became assurance in a few weeks, when a letter was pub-
lished which by the pertinacity of Mr. M, H. Marsh, had been obtained in
England from the Colonial Office, and was forwarded by him to Mr.
Gordon Sandeman. In this letter he was informed that “in a despatch
which has been lately received from the Governor on this subject, he
reports against the plan of separation, and that, consequently, Her
Majesty’s Government do not at present intend to take any further
proceedings on the subject.” To still further cheer the hearts of the
separationists, a letter was addressed by Mr. Clark Irving to the electors
of the Clarence and Darling Downs district, for which he was member,
in which he, in guarded language, but with unmistakeable intention,
declared that the Clarence and Richmond River districts would suffer
injury were they included within the boundary of the proposed new
colony ; that those districts were politically and commercially connected
with Sydney ; and that they would be adequately protected as to both
interests in the new Parliament. Mr. Clark Irving was a great man,
according to that kind of great men, in his day, and as is their wont,
went astray of the public welfare, when his immediate purposes were


concerned. He forgot that by a new postal route the Richmond was
brought within 150 miles of Brisbane by land, while it was 600 miles
from Sydney, and his predictions, as to the increasing prosperity of the
country he sought to exclude from independence, have been signally
falsified by events. I hardly think that the advance of the Clarence and
Richmond districts since 1856 can be considered as worth recording beside
that of Moreton Bay.
Close upon the publication of this letter came that of the correspon-
dence between Sir William Denison and the Home Government on the
subject, when the wrath of the people rose to fever height; and with
every disposition to lean lightly upon the memory of an able man no
longer alive to defend himself, I am compelled to think justly. The
statement of facts, meagre as it was in his report, was, when definite,
incorrect, and when accurate, incomplete. Questions of import or export
trade he did not touch. The actual or possible customs revenue he did
not even allude to. The freehold interest on the amount of capital sunk
in buildings and trade he passed by. He saw only that four hundred and
twenty squatters held two millions five hundred thousand acres of land
at a rent of £13,608 per annum, and he threw doubt upon even the lasting
character of that settlement, because of the small expenditure they had
made in permanent improvements. It never seems to have occurred to
him that the nature of the pursuit did not require them, but that so long
as a single station, and that not of the largest, would command a price of
£60,000 in the market, the profitable character of the avocation itself
must enforce permanency of occupation without respect to the personality
of the occupant. He might as well have said because by reason of death
there is a succession of tenants a tenancy is valueless. But I regret to
have to say that he was as disingenuous as illogical; and, that I may not
be supposed to write what is unfair, I quote his own language, less in the
way of censure than of warning, and to show my fellow colonists not only
what their predecessors had to fight against, but how easily and justly the
discrimination of English statesmen detected the mis-statements and
sophistry which had been presented for their acceptance, and how, so far
as their knowledge enabled them, they dealt fairly and uprightly
throughout this transaction.
“I have looked,” he says, in his despatch of October 18, 1855, “over
the former correspondence with relation to the proposed scheme of
separation, by which it would appear that the expediency of such a step
was first advocated by the inhabitants of the Northern districts,
principally with the view of inducing the Government to send a supply
of convict labour to that part of the colony. It is true that this was
objected to by a portion of the population, but still it formed the main
feature in most of the petitions. I am, therefore, X think, justified in


expressing my belief that the large squatters were the persons whose
interests were most consulted in the matter. In the later petitions the
question of the continuance’of transportation has been omitted, the policy
of the Home Government having been too clearly explained as regards
it to allow of any hope that convicts would be sent to Moreton Bay, even
were it made a separate colony ; but the persons who petition are the
same, with the addition, perhaps, of the trading population of the towns
of Brisbane and Ipswich. To those tire prospect of a large local expendi-
ture is probably the inducement which has caused them to apply for
separation from New South Wales.”
Anyone who has read this history so far with attention—and I have
spared no trouble in ascertaining the truth of the facts stated in it, and
have ample proof of their correctness in the records and documents of the
time —will judge for himself of the accuracy of this statement—one
reflecting discredit equally upon the judgment and truthfulness of the
writer.
1 That nothing should be wanting to show how local jealousies could
interfere to thwart the general good, the petition for a separate member
for the town of Ipswich was now presented to the Legislature. It did
not rest upon the actual claims of the town itself to distinct representa-
tion, which were in themselves sufficient, but it declared that the
interests of Ipswich and Brisbane were “ altogether antagonistic it
urged with great vehemence of language, the superior claims of the
petitioners to have the public buildings of the colony erected in their
own town, and asserted “ a strong probability that the Ipswich roll of
electors will soon outnumber that of Brisbane,” and on those grounds
enforced the desirability of separating the electorate. In the prayer of
their petition few would have refused to join, but in connection with the
argument it illustrated the famous description by Lord Mansfield of
popular conclusions which, whenever they were right in themselves, he
said, were seldom so from a right reason. And the time at which it was
presented was singularly inopportune. The people of Ipswich were, in
fact, playing into the hands of the opponents of separation.
Dr. Lang was active and impetuous as if the days of his youth had
returned. He left Sydney and arrived at Grafton on August 22, and two
days after met the people there, when he answered all Mr. Clark Irving’s
arguments promptly and lucidly, and apparently to the satisfaction of
his auditors. Then, as if to demonstrate the facility of communication
between the Clarence and Richmond and Moreton Bay, he travelled
overland to Brisbane, and, on September 11, delivered one of the best of
his many lectures, in the School of Arts there ; and I have no doubt that
the exceedingly vigorous and yet temperate reply of the Moreton Bay
O VOL. I.


Separation Committee to the report of Sir William Denison owed very
much of its pith to his pen.
While these active steps were taken, rumours arose that Sir William
Denison’s report had not had quite the weight which, from its curt and
dogmatic tone, he seems to have expected. Mr. Arthur Hodgson had then
recently arrived in Sydney from a lengthened visit to England, and in a
letter, addressed to the inhabitants of the Northern districts, narrating
the particulars of two interviews with Mr. Labouchere, gave them fresh
courage, and much annoyance to those who thought the opinion of the
Governor-General decisive upon the separation question. With the first
interview Mr. Hodgson was not quite satisfied, and with the impulsive-
ness which seems part of his nature, he asked a second for himself and
the colonists, then in London, acting with him. That interview, he said,
“ was entirely satisfactory. . . Mr. Labouchere, had had time to
consider the subject well, and I know that he worked up the question
and consulted with other gentlemen as to the propriety of our demands.
. . He gave us to understand that our demands were just—our argu-
ments good, and although he declined giving us there and then a distinct
pledge —we left Downiug-street with an impression that separation would
take place almost immediately.”
We may forgive Mr. Hodgson much vacillation and inconsistency,
and even his heresy on the wheat question, for the good service he did
the colony on that occasion on the main question—tempered as it was
by volunteer advice upon the future constitution which, I have no doubt,
the Secretary of State listened to with patience, and with equal equani-
mity forgot. As to the probable boundary, Mr. Labouchere suggested
that, were the Home Government to settle it, it would relieve the Govern-
ment and Parliament of New South Wales of an invidious duty. It is a
pity that that suggestion was not acted upon.
How bitter the feeling had grown in New South Wales against
separation we may collect from the speeches of leading men, and the tone
of the leading press there. As one, though by no means a solitary
instance, I quote from the speech of Mr. Darvall, the Solicitor-General, at
his nomination for the North Riding of Cumberland. In strong terms he
denounced what he termed the amputation of the richest province of the
colony.
“ Millions of acres of some of the finest land in our colony have thus been
torn from us, while we have incurred all the expense of finding, survey-
ing, settling, and rendering them valuable. . . To my mind, never
was there so weak, so mischievous, so insane a measure as this proposed
separation. Then again, look at the expense that must be incurred from
the necessary Government staff that will be required. At least £IOO,OOO


a year will to required to cover this ; and this will entail a burden of
taxation of at least £5 per head on the whole population. And ail this
at a time when the revenue of Moretou Bay, at the present time, is
hardly sufficient to support a corporal's guard in a watch-house. It
appears to me a most wicked and most mischievous act to cut off from
us a thriving settlement that has cost us so much to bring to its present
state of prosperity.”
When the violence of partizanship could carry an experienced lawyer
and politician to such lengths, we may well imagine what men of less
diameter and caution might write or say. Yet, at the census of 1855,
the population of the northern districts—exclusive of that of New Eng-
land included within the proposed boundary—was 19,321, and a fair
estimate of the revenue derivable from duties, on their consumption and
other ordinary sources, and from land sales and assessments, was about
£IIO,OOO. The assessment alone was close upon £15,000; surely more
than adequate to the support of many corporals’ guards.
In the midst of all this wrangling came a despatch from Mr.
Labouohere which finally settled the question of separation itself, and left
only details to be arranged. The importance of this State paper in the
history of the colony is sufficient to justify my quoting the most weighty
paragraphs ; more especially as two leading questions discussed in them
—the southern boundary, and the arrangement of the public debt—cannot
even now be regarded as sufficiently determined to be without interest
to us.
“ X have now,” writes Mr. Labouchere, addressing the Governor-
General, “to inform you that Her Majesty’s Government have determined
that the time has arrived when this separation would be desirable. They
have not failed to give their fullest attention to the arguments adduced
by yourself as well as by Sir Charles Eitzroy against this determination.
But they feel that those arguments rest on premises which are every
day more and more set aside by the progress of events. And on the
whole they believe that it is better to run the risk of forming into a
oolorry a community as yet in some respects immature, but rapidly ad-
vancing to maturity, than of letting the partial difficulties of separation
and the ill-feeling, which the present state of things is calculated to
engender, grow stronger from day to day. In addition to these views of
their own they have been urged by the strong and repeated representa-
tions of parties possessing the confidence of the inhabitants of the
northern districts and also by statements directly proceeding from what
they believe to be the majority of the inhabitants of the northern districts.
. .' . The following are the most important questions, as it occurs to
me, which remain to be decided: —1. The boundary between the two
future provinces : On this point I have had the valuable assistance of a
memorandum drawn up by Mr. E. Deas Thomson, when in England, as
well as of the statements of gentlemen interested in the northern pro-
vinces. With the materials thus before them, Her Majesty’s Government
O*


will have no difficulty in fixing on a line which will run not far to the
south of 30 S. latitude ; but will be accommodated to suit the natural
features of the country. 2. The future government of the separated
portion :—The necessary powers for this purpose have been conferred on
Her Majesty by the Act of Parliament enabling her to confirm the New
South Wales Bill, and I shall address you further on the subject on
another occasion. 3. The division of the debt of the province ;—I am in
correspondence with the law advisers of the Crown on the subject of
the legal method by which this division may be effected. But, whatever
their opinion on this point may be, there can be no doubt that the basis of
arrangement should be an equitable division according to the several
contributions to the revenue of the two portions ; and the benefit which
they respectively derived or expected from the public services to which
the loans thus contracted were appropriated. On this subject, especially,
I am anxious to receive, as soon as practicable, a report from yourself,
with the advice of your Council.”
The publication of this despatch was received with the liveliest
expressions of joy. So many flags never flaunted in Brisbane before. The
day, however, was dark and lowering, and towards noon there was a
heavy storm of wind and rain. Dr. Lang was loud in his congratulations,
although dissenting from any boundary that might be fixed lower than
the 30th parallel—a dissent rather premature, and, as it subsequently
proved, ineffectual. A public meeting was held in Brisbane on the 20th,
when an address of gratitude to the Queen was adopted, and thanks voted
to the gentlemen who had exerted themselves in London, as well as
specially to Dr. Lang for his great and long continued efforts to secure to
the district the desired boon of separation. But all was not joy and
gratitude. The disunion I have before referred to had borne fruit, and
the warning of Dr. Lang against Mr. Holt had been abundantly justified.
On November 3 Mr. Hargreaves, member for the Maoleay and New Eng-
land districts, brought forward a motion in the Legislative Assembly,
which, while generally censuring the conduct of the Imperial authorities,
was principally condemnatory of the boundary line suggested, and depre-
cated any settlement until the opinion of the inhabitants of the Clarence
and Richmond and New England districts had been ascertained. In the
course of the debate very acrimonious language was employed towards the
Imperial authorities, and the proposed new colony. Mr. Holt, while pro-
fessing himself a separationist, objected to the boundary, and was one of
the thirty-five who voted in favour of Mr. Hargreaves’ resolutions against
a minority of four. At the meeting great indignation was displayed at
this conduct—most of the speakers, however, assuming the question to be
settled beyond all fear of change. In this they were, unfortunately both
for the new colony and for the districts sought to be excluded from it,
altogether premature. They undervalued the force against them, and do


not seem to have appreciated the pertinacity of Sir William Denison, or
the skill and organisation which were combined to secure the retention of
the country in dispute to New South Wales. As was natural, Mr. Holt’s
constituents met and condemned his conduct, and a requisition was at
once put in circulation calling upon him to resign. Mr. Holt, hearing of
this, entered upon explanations in the Legislative Assembly, in which he
employed language for which he was reprimanded by the Speaker, and
which in nowise increased his favour in the eyes of his constituents ; for
those explanations simply amounted to this—that while he meant what he
did say at the time of his election, he did not by any means say all that
he meant. Mr. Hargreaves’ resolutions being sent to the Legislative
Council for their concurrence, Mr. E. Deas Thomson took occasion to ex-
press regret at having given the advice he did to Mr. Labouchore, and
voted in their favour. The honourable gentleman had had many years’
experience in the colony, and knew all the circumstances surrounding the
question well. Either he gave that advice on due deliberation or he did
not. If he did so, no circumstance had occurred since the time it was
given to change the character of the facts upon which it was presumedly
based, and there was no valid reason for the course he adopted. If he did
not, he insulted the Government, to whom the opinion was tendered, and
the colony in whose interests he was presumedly acting. In either case
he had the melancholy satisfaction of setting a precedent for that weak
vacillation, so nearly akin to a worse fault of which since that day there
has been no lack of followers. The resolutions were of course carried, and
there, with the exception of some letters of Dr. Lang’s, deprecatory of any
alteration from his favourite 30th parallel, the matter for the present
rested.
The stream of immigration flowed rather slackly during the year,
and there was unfortunately a considerable migration southward from the
district. The direct arrivals from Great Britain were 1,258, and of these
some, despite the remonstrances of the inhabitants, were transhipped to
Sydney. About 350 Germans were brought, of whom a portion was also
forwarded to Sydney. The Moreton Bay Land and Emigration Company
assumed what may ho termed a definitely passive shape ; a board of
directors being formed, and a call of half-a-crown per share being made,
hut only for the purpose of defraying the preliminary expenses incurred
in passing the Act. All further action, it was announced, would be
delayed until the result of an effort to be made in England to obtain th«
co-operation 6f capitalists there was seen.
The pastoral industry of the district continued to extend, but on other
matters there was more talk than action. The cultivation of cotton,


which had languished, began again to be discussed, especially after the
prizes gained by Mr. Eldridge for his exhibit at the Paris Industrial
Exposition became known. Estimates were published from time to time
showing theoretic profits, but varying in return from thirty to fifty per
cent. Mr. Eldridge utilised his practical experience in the matter by
furnishing one for the cultivation of 610 acres. The capital invested he
fixed at £B,BIO, the annual expenditure at £1,085, the gross annual return
at £8,250, but the selling price of the product he took at one shilling and
sixpence per lb.—one which was thought by the Liverpool Chamber of
Commerce to be below that which could be readily obtained for cotton of
equal quality to that submitted to them. A lecture on the subject, deli-
vered by Mr. Wm. Brookes in August, was supposed likely to impart a
stimulus to the very little effort then making to forward the industry.
Kcws of a proposed company forming in Sydney for the cultivation of
cotton in Moreton Bay excited a little curiosity, but it proved to be of
intention only ; although a series of questions asked by Mr. T, S. Mort, of
Sydney, pointed to a more business like effort than had yet been made.
These were placed in Hr. Hobbs’s hands for reply, and his answers were
practical and comprehensive, but what beneficial result followed I am
unable to say. The late Mr. Panton made some experiments, but
expressed an opinion that coolie labour would be required if extensive
cultivation were entered upon ; an opinion which did not increase either
his popularity or that of the industry. Coal-mining was pursued in a sort
of intermittent fashion, new pits being opened—always with promises of
success ; and wheat growing was still continued, between fifty and sixty
acres being reported as under crop by several persons in the vicinity of
Brisbane ; but there does not seem to have been any systematic or com-
bined effort at testing the suitability of the soil and climate for the growth
of cereals or for ascertaining the best methods of deriving a certain
remuneration from it.
The exports for the first nine months of the year exhibited a steady
increase. From Brisbane alone the values were calculated at £301,392 ;
but with the exception of a few tons of coal, the articles were almost
entirely confined to merely pastoral products. There were occasional
spurts of rumour as to gold deposits, and isolated parties were fitted out,
to return sanguine in hope and empty in performance. Upon the whole
the period was one of doubt and depression—not lessened by a long and
severe drought to which the district was this year subjected.
Some effort was made by the New South Wales Government to
ascertain what was really required for the improvement of the river
navigation. Mr. Grundy, the engineer employed, sent in two reports—


one on the obstructions between the towns o£ Brisbane and Ipswich, the
other on the works required between Brisbane and the Bay. His report
was not favourable to the navigation of the Brisbane by vessels of any
tonnage beyond the barrier formed by what are called the Seventeen-mile
Books. “It would be necessary, ere vessels arriving in Moreton Bay
could proceed to Ipswich, to deepen almost the entire bed of the river”
from that point to the junction of the Bremer with it. With respect to
the river below Brisbane, he proposed to deepen a main channel through
the flats in it, and use the material thus obtained to fill up the minor
ones, so as to produce a greater current, and one strong enough to keep
that open. The bar at the mouth of the river, he suggested, should be
dredged, so as to continue the channel existing up to it in a straight
course through. The cost he estimated—employing one dredge—at
£13,062, and the time at eight years. The report did not pass without
criticism, and, in truth, it added little or nothing to that of Mr. Deben-
ham, to which I have before referred. As nothing practical followed
from it, it is needless to recapitulate the comment it provoked. The
energies of the then Government seem to have been so exhausted by the
effort made to obtain information that no strength was loft to utilise it
when got.
The progress of improvement in other respects was gradual. The
depression to which I have alluded was less apparent towards the end of
the year than it had been in its earlier part, and strong articles con-
demnatory of the banks for “ putting on the screw,” were followed by
others announcing the appearance of “blue sky” in the commercial
atmosphere. But the lugubrious mixed with the congratulatory. The
want of some “ suitable means of conveying their dead to the place of in-
terment” was bewailed by the local journals, and it was gravely suggested
that “ a small hearse, drawn by one horse, would not involve any serious
outlay.” The late Captain Towns, then on a visit to Brisbane, seems to
have been so deeply impressed with the want that he offered to head a
subscription for the provision of the required accommodation with £2O.
lam unable to trace any response to this cheerful invitation. It is pos-
sible that the minds of the people ran rather upon the wants of the living
than ceremonial for the dead, for, on March 8, a meeting was held, at
which the grievances of the people were discussed and a committee ap-
pointed to bring under the notice of the Government the necessity of
proceeding with the public works of the district, the gaol, the lighthouse
at Moreton Bay, and two semaphore telegraph stations —but there rvas as
much grumbling at the common apathy of the people as at the treatment
they received from their rulers. Whether the_ action of the authorities


was at all expedited by such procedure it is not easy to say, but ten-
ders were at length accepted for the construction o£ the lighthouse at
Moreton Island, and the works were commenced, not without some dis-
content that they were not entrusted to the local contractor, which ex-
panded into a desire that tenders for local -works should be received and
decided upon by a local board, instead of being sent on to Sydney. The
sudden activity of Brisbane started Ipswich into life, and the people in
their turn petitioned the Government that the gaol and other public
buildings should be erected there ; in reply to which they were told that
their request could not be complied with, and on another application for
a local immigration depot they were similarly unsuccessful. The spirit,
of association spread to the stockholders, who had been alarmed at the
appearance of a disease called “catarrh” in the flocks on the Clifton run,
and who now formed a society for mutual protection. A common sub-
scription was entered into, and the N orthern District Mutual Protection
Society was formed. Mr, Tooth agreed that the diseased sheep were at
once to be killed and boiled down on the run—the cost of carrying the
skins and tallow to the shipping port being borne by the new society, and
thus peace was restored, protection provided, and the danger for the time
got rid of.
About this time, a survey for a line of railway to connect the coast
with the Darling Downs was talked of as to be provided for amongst
similar undertakings for which a vote was asked ; and the mere proposal
was the signal for further discord. It was contended that the termina-
tion of the line at Ipswich would be adequate for every purpose, and that
the facilities of water carriage presented by the Bremer and Brisbane rivers
were ample for the accommodation of any traffic that could result from its
construction. That nothing should be wanting in support of this theory, the
residents of the Downs were moved, and, in public meeting at Drayton,
adopted petitions, alike in language, to the Governor-General, the Legisla-
tive Council, and the Legislative Assembly, in which they asserted that to
make a railway “ beneficial and advantageous to the northern districts and
the interests thereof, it will be necessary to make the terminus of such rail-
way at the head of the navigation of the rivers Brisbane and Bremer.” It is
unnecessary to detail arguments of which the course of events have since
proved the fallacy ; but it shows how far local prejudice could cloak local
ignorance when we find the country from Ipswich to the foot of the great
dividing range described as “ offering no engineering difficulty,”—the
very abrupt and jagged mountainous spurs of the Little Liverpool range,
requiring a costly tunnel, intervening—while it was gravely affirmed that,
from an inland terminus, at the foot of the main range, “good roads


could diverge in all directions the fact being that but one pass for
ordinary traffic over the range, and that difficult and dangerous, has been
found up to this date in a length of very many miles. All this was ex-
ceedingly pitiable and exceedingly mischievous.
There was some consolation for the well wishers of the new province
in the real progress quietly, but effectually, made in other respects. The
savings bank was found of great benefit throughout the northern districts,
and I find it recorded as a proof of the extent to which it was appreci-
ated, that £3OO was sent down by the Messrs. Boyds, for deposit on
account of their men employed at the Juandah station, in the Leichhardt.
The Botanic Gardena began to assume a grateful aspect, and their long
career of usefulness was fairly started. The Ipswich library and reading
room met with efficient support, and the Brisbane School of Arts added to
its books, and was enlivened by debates of the usual speculative kind. In
a report of one upon the question, “ Is it expedient to abolish capital
punishment?” I find the names of two gentlemen who have since occupied
prominent positions in our local, political, and official world—those of
Mr. Charles Lilley and Mr. T. P. Pugh. IVas it indicative of their future
career that they were on that occasion—as in those times on most occa-
sions—in a majority? And amidst the signs of progress and coming
prosperity with which the Courier cheered its readers at the close of the
year, was the, at least, tolerable certainty that a branch of the Supreme
Court, with a resident judge, would now soon be fixed at Moreton Bay, as
indicated not only by the introduction of a Bill to carry out that object,
but by a sum of £4,861 being placed on the estimates for the next year
on account of the expenses that would be incurred. In rather odd con-
trast to these increased facilities for law, the value of forbearance and
Christian love was emphatically inculcated. Had the advice been liter-
ally adopted, the legal blessings might have been less felt, though possibly
quite as fully appreciated.
Not the least memorable event of the year w T as the successful com-
pletion by Mr. Gregory of the exploration committed to his charge. He
returned to Brisbane on December 16, after an absence of sixteen months,
having performed the service enjoined upon him, and bringing much
valuable information as to the nature of the country traversed. It will
be remembered that the two vessels, the Monarch and the Tom Tough,
left Moreton Bay on August 12, 1853. On September 2, they were near
to Vernon Island, in Van Diemen’s Gulf, on the northern coast, when the
Monarch grounded on a coral bank, and was not floated until the 10th.
On the 16th Mr. Gregory landed at Blunder Bay, on the mouth of the
Victoria Eiver, when he found the country unfit for camping. Finding


no improvement as he proceeded, he turned back, and two days after
joined the Monarch in Treachery Bay, when he learned that some of the
horses had been landed. On the 22nd he formed the first camp at Provi-
dence Hill, an elevation on Point Pearce, on the north-east shore of the
entrance to the Victoria. The stores, sheep, and horses being all removed
from the Monarch, that vessel sailed for Singajmre on the 21th, the Tom
Tough being directed to proceed up the river as far as she could, that a
camp might be established on a suitable site, and there the vessel was to
await the land party. After a reconnoitring expedition by Mr. Gregory to
ascertain the probably best route towards the supposed point of rendez-
vous, the party started to examine the country on the east banks of the
Victoria on September 28. Of the fifty horses taken from Moreton Bay,
nine had died from various causes, and many were so weak that they fell
down, and had to be lifted up before they could feed. The sheep taken
with the explorers on this trip were abandoned the first day from like
causes. On October 16 they sighted the Victoria Eiver, about six miles
below Kangaroo Point, and camping, met with a misfortune in the firing
of the grass by the carelessness of the cook. On October 20 they fell in
with Mr. Elsey, the surgeon, one of those who had remained on board the
Tom Tough, and learned from him that the vessel had grounded on a ledge
of rooks on a southern bank of the river, and sustained serious damage.
Many of the stores had been destroyed, and of the sheep only fifty-four re-
mained and in a miserable condition. After much hard work the schooner
was moved on October 29, close to the bank and to the camp. In the course
of the removals and .shiftings, more sheep were lost or compelled to be
abandoned, until only twenty-six remained. The general weakness of the
animals and the necessity for providing shelter for the stores, which had to
be removed from the damaged vessel, delayed the explorers ; but on No-
vember 21 Mr. Gregory, his brother Mr. H. Gregory, Dr. Muller, and Mr.
Wilson left with seven horses and twenty days’ provisions to examine
the country through which the main party would have to travel on the
route to the interior. They continued their examination until December
G, -when, having examined the country sufficiently to enable an advance
through a whole degree of latitude, they commenced their return, and
reached their principal camp (lat. 15 degs. 31 mins. S., long. 130 degs. 22
min. E.) on the 13th. Upon consideration, and finding that owing to the
nature of the vegetation, the whole equipment would have to be carried
on pack-horses, it was determined that the exploring party should consist
of nine, taking with them five months’ provisions and necessaries ; the
remaining members of the expedition having full employment in the
repair of the schooner and the care of the stores. The wet weather
which now befel them impeded their preparations, and it was not until


January 3, 18515, that the adventurers could fairly start. They were—
Mr, A. C. Gregory, commander ; Mr. H. Gregory, assistant-commander ;
Mr. T. Baines, artist ; Dr. F. Muller —now the Baron Von Muller—
botanist; Mr. T. Flood, collector, and four assistants ; the geologist, Mr,
J. S. Wilson ; the surgeon, Mr. Elsey ; and some others, remained at the
principal camp on the Victoria Eiver. For those who are carious on such
matters, I give a copy of Mr. Gregory’s memorandum of their arrange-
ments and equipment: —
“ The exploring party has with it 27 packdiorses with pack-saddles* ;
3 pack-horses with riding-saddles ; 6 riding horses, or in all 36 horses.
Flour, 1,470 lbs.; pork, 1,200 lbs.; rice, 200 lbs.; sago, 44 lbs.; sugar, 280
lbs.; tea, 36 lbs.; coffee, 28 lbs.; tobacco, 21 lbs.; soap, 51 lbs. —or in all,
3,330 lbs. Instruments, clothing, tents, ammunition, horse-shoes, tools,
&c., 800 lbs.; saddle-bags and packages, 400 lbs.; saddles, bridles, hobbles,
&c., 900 lbs.—total, 5430 lbs. The total weight of the equipment of the
party was thus about two and a-half tons, which, distributed on 30 horses,
gave an average load of 180 lbs. each. Bach person had a stated number
of horses in his special charge, and was responsible for the proper care of
the loads and equipment, the saddles and loads being all marked with
corresponding numbers. A watch was constantly kept through the night,
each person being on sentry for two hours in regular rotation, except
myself, as I had to make astronomical observations at uncertain hours.
The cook was on watch from 2 till 4 a.m., and having prepared breakfast,
the party concluded thin meal before daybreak, and thus the most raluahle
2>art of the day teas net lost."
On January 22 they arrived at a point where advanced exploration
seemed necessary ; and after this had been made, a depot camp was
. “ • The pack-saddlea were made after a model by Mr, Gregory, and are the best I have
seen yet.. Two boards of light wood arc connected by bows of iron IJ-inch wide and f
inch thick, with hooks inserted in either side for the pack-bags to.hook on to. The straps
for the breasting, breechings, and girths were screwed on to the boards; the crupper
passed through a ring on the after bow ; and a light pad—which could easily be taken out
to be re-stuffed—was secured by small thongs, passed through holes in the ends of the
boards. We hail two girths, which crossed each other under the horse, (In unloading,
tke neck-strap is unbuckled on the near side, also the breasting and girths ; and the whole
is drawn off behind.) The pack-bags were made of one width of canvas, turned so as to
have no seam on the bottom ; pear-shaped pieces were sewn in to form ends, and rope was
stitched along the seams, having eyes above, by which the bag was hung upon the hooks.
The flour-bags were made of canvas, of the usual width, with a round bottom stitched
into them. The mouth was sew-n up when full, and an oiled bag, of the same size, drawn
over it. . . . Our waterproof-bags were of leather, lined with waterproof cloth, just
large enough to fill one of the canvas pack-hags. They had a brass neck, with a worm
inside, in which we screwed a plug of soft wood. Each pair of bags was carefully
balanced one against the other, that the horses might not be unequally loaded.”—J/e.

formed on the 29th, near to a hill called Mount Sanford, about latitude
17 deg. 30 see. Then leaving Mr, Barnes and the men in charge, Mr.
Gregory, his brother, Dr. Miiller, and the harness-maker, Charles Dean,
taking eleven of the strongest horses and a moderate supply of provisions,
pushed into the unknown interior, continuing generally in a southerly
direction, until February 10, when they were stopped by a sandy desert
country. On this they turned in a north-easterly direction until the 15th,
when they struck off, steering an average south-west course, following the
line of a creek called by Mr. Gregory, Sturt’s Creek, which they travelled
for nearly three hundred miles, when they traced it into the bed of a then
dry salt lake ; beyond which the whole country to the south seemed one
vast desert, destitute of any indications of the existence of water. They,
therefore, on March 5, abandoned all hope of penetrating further in a
southerly direction, and started on their return. After leaving Sturt’s
Creek, they ridge about 1,700 feet above the sea, and then came
upon another creek, which they named Sterling Creek, and supposed to
fall into Cambridge Gulf. Thence they pushed on for the depst camp,
where they arrived on the 28th, and found all the party left in charge in
good health and order. The ration of the explorers per diem had been
1 lb. of flour, l-sth lb. of pork, and 2 ozs. of sugar—not exactly the diet
of a Sybarite. After three days rest, Mr. Gregory again started to
examine the country to the eastward of the depot camp, returning on
April 17, and thence after some minor investigation, reaching the prin-
cipal camp on the Victoria Paver on May 9. The schooner was yet
completing her repairs—the carpenter had died, some of the crew were
sick, but the men connected with the expedition were all in good health.
The result of this portion of the exploration had been to conclusively
demonstrate the uselessness of the Victoria Elver for reaching the interior,
and to dissipate the expectations tliat had been founded on a contrary
supposition.
On a review of his own position, Mr. Gregory determined that it
would be best to send the schooner—reinforcing her crew by some of his
own men—to Cocpang, in the island of Timor, where a supply of rice,
sugar, and other stores could be got. These obtained, he directed that
she should sail for the Albert River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, he and
his party pursuing their journey together by land in the discharge of the
second portion of their task—the connection of the Albert with the
Victoria by a practicable route. This expedition finally consisted of Mr.
Gregory and his brother, Dr. Muller, Mr. Flsey,. and three other's.
Amongst the preparations for a start, I notice the making of meat
biscuits, thus described—


“ 6 lbs. of flour were added to each 6 lb. tin of preserved beef with
the whole of the _ fat and gravy, and 1 oz. of salt (no water being
required) ; the whole being worked up into a stiff dough, and baked in
the ordinary form and size of sea biscuit, the whole weight of which was
8 lbs. Thus 1J lb. of biscuit was equal to 1 lb. of meat and 1 lb. of flour.”
On June 21 they started ; and, after a journey marked by no par-
ticular occurrence, reached the Albert on August 31, when they were
disappointed at not finding any sign of the Tom Tovgh* Marking a tree,
therefore, and burying a tin cannister with some papers, in case she
should arrive, they—abandoning any idea of connecting their route with
the termination of Sir Thomas Mitchell’s journey as impracticable with
the means at their disposal—entered upon the last part of their explora-
tion : the tracing a route from the Albert easterly to Moreton Bay.
Crossing the Plains of Promise of Stokes, they turned northward to the
Gilbert Paver, which they reached on September 21. They then struck in
a south-easterly direction, and by October 30 arrived at the junction of
the Suttor with the Burdekin. By November 15 they came upon the
Mackenzie, which they followed up until they reached the coast, and, just
below the junction of the two, found the remains of a camp of Leich-
hardt’s, in his second expedition. Thence steering east, by the 21st they
reached the Dawson, and, on the next day, a station then hold by Messrs.
Fitz and Connor. The journey to Brisbane was then comparatively easy,
and Mr. Gregory reached Brisbane, as I have said, on December 16. Of
the thirty-four horses with which he left the Victoria River, he had
twenty-nine remaining, and had sold one ; and his stores and equipment
generally had been found more than sufficient.
As to the geological nature of the country travelled over, or its value
for pastoral or agricultural settlement, it will be sufficient to say that Mr.
Gregory’s contributions at the time were valuable and interesting, and
added much to the then existing limited stock of knowledge. More note-
worthy was the deliberate caution, yet at no sacrifice of time, with which
every step was taken, and the general immunity from sickness or accident
which characterised the expedition under his immediate charge through-
out its course. He added to his reputation as a cool and courageous
explorer, and established what was of equal importance, his character as
eminently a safe one. There was nothing sensational attempted ; none of
what is generally termed “ dash”; but what was to be done, and how,

being found unfit for the further service of the expedition, was sent to Sourabaya, and
sold.


were fully weighed, and when determined carried thoroughly out; and
thus the expedition was not the least useful, while it certainly was one of
the best conducted and successful of our Australian explorations.

It may seem somewhat in contradiction to my usual course that I have
grouped the occurrences of the last three years of this narrative into
a single chapter, but in the history of a district like Moretou Bay, there
are periods of what may be called repetition—when the current of events
in one year so recalls those of its predecessor, and prefigures what may be
expected in the next, that the monotony of recapitulation becomes tire-
some, and the reader longs for variety of incident and rapidity of action.
I do not conceal from myself that the years 1857-8-9 afford little, except
towards the end of 1859, that would excite the attention of nine-tenths of
the present population of Queensland. They were years of suspense, and
not unfrequently of tantalizing uncertainty. The people felt that separa-
tion was secured, hut its precise shape and the details of its final accom-
plishment were still subjects for conjecture. The delays of Sir William
Denison in reporting on the questions submitted to him, as to details, by
the Colonial Office, the hindrances opposed at every step by the New South
Wales Government, and the extraordinary misapprehension by the
Imperial authorities as to the legal and formal measures to be taken,
together with Ministerial changes in England, combined to delay the
actual proclamation of the new colony for nearly three years after its
separation had been determined upon.
The feeling towards the district, of the legislature and the leading
public men of New South Wales, was one of exasperation, tending to


. obstruction in every possible form ; but there were some administrative
measures so obviously necessary, as well as just, that they could not be
withheld. The bill for the establishment of a branch of the Supreme
Court, with a resident judge in the district, having been at length passed,
Mr. Justice Milford was appointed to the judgeship, and formally opened
his court in Brisbane on April 15, 1857. But. this Act proving defective,
another was enacted, by which the former one, with the exception of the
clause under which Mr. Justice Milford was made a resident judge, was
repealed. The new measure authorised, in addition, the appointment of a
Crown prosecutor, a sheriff, a registrar of the Supreme Court in Moreton
Bay, an official assignee in insolvency, and a curator of intestate estates.
The judge himself was to act as commissioner in insolvency for the dis-
trict ; whence arose the absurdity, long continued, of an appeal from the
decisions of the commissioner to the same person as judge. Mr. —now
Mr. Justice—Eatcliife Bring, whose professional and political career forms
no inconsiderable portion of the subsequent history of the colony, was
appointed Crown Prosecutor ; the late Mr. W. A. Brown, Sheriff; and the
late Mr. Pickering, Official Assignee. In the course of time, grumblings
arose in Brisbane at the frequent absences of Mr. Justice Milford from the
seat of his jurisdiction, and in Sydney there was a mild jocularity at his
expense, touching his supposed angling achievements, in which pursuit it
pleased the wits of that metropolis to assume that the Judge found his
almost sole employment. It was well understood that he did not himself
particularly enjoy his residence in this locality, and was not sorry when
legal exigencies, real or supposed, compelled his return to the more varied
enjoyments which Sydney could adford. Whether it was sympathy with
Mr. Justice Milford’s banishment, or a real desire for his aid on the
Sydney judicial bench, that moved Mr. Plunkett, I cannot say, but in the
session of 1858-9 he brought in a bill “to enable the Governor, from time
to time, to appoint a barrister to act temporarily as assistant district
judge at Moreton Bay, and for other purposes therein mentioned.” What-
ever might have been the motive for this attempt, it failed ; but it was
not long before a change took place, acceptable enough to the parties
most concerned, although assailed by others with all the bitterness of
personal dislike, as well as of political hostility.
For, in September, 1857, the Parker administration of New South
Wales resigned, and a new Ministry was formed, on what were called
“liberal” principles. The late Sir Charles—then Mr. Charles—Cowper
(afterwards Agent-General in London for New South Wales) was the
Premier ; Mr. R. Campbell, Colonial Treasurer ; Mr. T. A. Murray, Secre-
tary for Lands ; Mr. James Martin—now Sir James, and Chief Justice of
New South Wales—Attorney-General; and Mr. A. J. P. Lutwyche, Soli


citor-General. A hostile vote led to a dissolution, and ultimately to a
change—Mr. John Robertson—now Sir John, but familiarly known as
“Free Selection Jack”—taking the Lands portfolio. Towards the end of
1858 dissensions ensued between the Attorney-General and his colleagues,
partly from, what were called, his conservative tendencies—which were
said to have manifested themselves in a carelessness and inattention to
his official duties, which, in one instance, led to a vote of censure on the
whole Ministry—and partly, as he is reported to have explained, from
dislike to the direction which he saw Mr. Cowper’s politics were taking.
At the request of the Premier, Mr. Martin resigned ; and Mr. Lutwyche
succeeded him as Attorney-General. ' At this time it was understood that
Mr. Justice Thcrry was , about to resign, contemplating a visit to Europe,
and there immedediately arose a fierce party contest as to who should
take his place ; but it was soon known that Mr. Justice Milford would be
recalled to Sydney, while the Attorney-General would, in the ordinary
course of succession, be appointed to his seat. In due time these appoint-
ments were made, Mr. Lutwyche being sworn in and gazetted on
February 22, 1859, as judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales,
and arriving in Brisbane on March 8. His elevation to the Bench was
the cause of some exceedingly bitter debates in the New South Wales
Parliament, in which private, as well as political, animosity seems to have
prevailed with his assailants, to the exclusion of all sense of public justice.
That he would fail as a judge, was predicted with a confidence as full as
the contradiction which his more than twenty years subsequent judicial
career abundantly furnished.
The legislation of this period possesses but a slight interest for
Queensland. The ElectoraP Act, to which I have before referred, was,
from the causes I have mentioned, inoperative here, except as to the
interim elections between its passing and the formal separation of the
district from New South Wales. It gave nine members to the then north-
ern districts, but was received with only a slight degree of attention
which what feeling could be evoked by a temporary representation, could
not fan into enthusiasm—even when the influence that a present success
might exercise in the choice of members for the future local Legislative
Asse,mbly was accorded the weight supposed to .be its due. The New
South Wales Legislative Assembly was dissolved in April 1859 ; the writs
for the new one were issued in the following May, but the news of the
formal completion of the separation arrangements arrived before the date
at which the last was returnable. Mr. Robertson, however, had ex-
pounded his land policy—which in our colonial legislation has something
more than historic value. Its principal points were :—a reduction in the
npset price of lands sold by auction to five shillings per acre ; a right of
P VOL, I.


free selection over all country lands, surveyed or nnsurveyed, at a fixed
price of £1 per acre, half the purchase money being paid on selection, the
remainder by deferred payments ; and the determination of the minimum
area open to selection by any one person at 80 acres, and the maximum
at 320. Commenting upon this Mr. Macalister, at Ipswich, on June 25,
said, “ Though I have a very favourable leaning to the Cowper Ministry
I object to the Land Bill, which, if passed, would be ruin to the country
nor was he unsupported in this opinion, even by the most popular candi-
dates of the day. But separation left the remodelling of the land policy
of the new colony to its own legislature ; and, except as indications of the
direction that might be taken, these expressions of opinion were of no
importance. The elections resulted in the return of Mr. Richardson for
Brisbane, Mr. E. Cribb for East Moreton, Mr. Macalister for Ipswich,
Mr. John Douglas and Mr. \Vm. Handcock for the Darling Downs, and
Mr. W. 11. Walsh for the Leichhardt. Mr. Clarke Irving was again elected
for the Clarence district, and Mr. Hodgson, who had taken the manage-
ment of the Australian Agricultural Company’s business in New South
Wales, now found an aristocratic refuge amongst the colliers of New-
castle, adjoining which port the coal mines of the Company were situated.
The new Assessment Act was, as was natural, received with no small
dissatisfaction, open and unexpressed. The rates paid by the pastoral
lessees up to this time were a halfpenny for every sheep (or twenty-one
shillings and eightpence per thousand), three halfpence for every head of
cattle, and threepence for every horse which were upon any run, or which
the run was estimated to be capable of carrying. These rates were now
increased to seven pounds ten shillings for every thousand sheep, and
proportionately for cattle and horses. And the method of fixing the rents
on new and renewed leases in the settled districts was also altered. Under
the Orders in Council they had been £lO for the first four thousand sheep
and £2 10s. for every additional thousand : they were now to be charged
for renewal at the rate of £2 per square mile, and for new leases at £l.
These increases were calculated to add considerably to the revenue, and
abridge more than was liked the squatter’s profits, and the squatters were
proportionately angry. Some of them had recourse to Mr. Martin, who
gave a legal opinion that the Act was illegal, he having been nevertheless
Attorney-General in the Ministry by whom it was brought in. Mr. Lut-
wyche, his successor, effectually controverted that opinion, 1 and the Act
was carried out in the usual way. A somewhat amusing incident occurred
in the course of the opposition to this measure. Several gentlemen in the
Burnett district met at Gayndah in January, 1859, and were valorous in
their protests against it. They pledged themselves to resist the Act by
every means in their power—they even agreed to raise a fund to defray


the costs of an appeal to the law courts, by contributions proportionate in
amount to the number of sheep upon their runs ; they made an immediate
call of half-a-crown per thousand sheep to defray current expenses—and
their fellow-squatters who read the advertisements in which these pro-
ceedings were published, were no doubt much comforted by the valiancy
of their volunteer defenders. In due time the owners of 222,000 sheep
and 2,500 cattle signed the required undertaking. The following July
witnessed the entire collapse of the alliance : it met with no outside
support and the Assessment Act was therefore safe. Th« sole memorials
of their patriotism left to the members were the advertisements and the
receipts for payment for their insertion. The impression I derive from a
careful consideration of all the facts is, that the runs were known to be
generally assessed at ,a carrying power much below their real capacity,
and that the Act was designed to meet a contingency which could not
otherwise be easily, if at all, provided for.
Municipal institutions were pet topics for eulogy with Sir William
Denison, who regarded them as academies wherein men rising in social
position amongst their fellows might in time learn to become legislators;
and in this opinion he found a subsequent and earnest supporter in Sir
George Bowen. Undoubtedly as regards forms and method in public
business, and as developing readiness for co-operation and a proportionate
sacrifice of individual will in administrative matters, the value of such
institutions was not overrated by these Governors ; but, as fitting the
persons engaged in them for the higher and in some respects opposite
business of general legislation, their influence may be questioned, as more
likely to produce a deteriorative than a beneficial effect. Mill, in his ad-
mirable treatise on representative government, has discussed the question
with his accustomed logical and analytical power, and in a more than
usually practical direction, and his conclusions seem directly contrary to
those I have indicated as arrived at by Sir William Denison and Sir
George Bowen. Those who desire to see in how masterly a manner he
dealt with the subject will find their time well spent in a careful perusal
of the great logician and economist’s essay.
But Sir William Denison was not content to be a theorist, and the
first Municipalities Act in these colonies (22 Vic., No. 13, N.S.W.) is
understood to have been pushed forward all the more vigorously for his
hearty exertions towards its enactment. It was assented to on October
27, 1858, and, running to ninety-six clauses, dealt with a variety of powers
and duties which it is unnecessary to refer to in detail, inasmuch as we
had our own Act emendatory of that, and which itself supplied another
instance of the ordinary character of legislation by, in its turn, requiring
p*


further amendment. The residents of Brisbane and Ipswich were soon
engaged in discussing the desirability of availing themselves of the pro-
visions of the new measure, and assuming the management of their own
local affairs. It was necessary to petition the Governor in Council to
proclaim a municipality, to fix its boundaries, and to provide for the first
election of a Municipal Council. The people of Ipswich were first in the
field, and met on December 9, 1858, when the necessary petition was sub-
mitted to the meeting ; but the meeting was not in accord from the
beginning, a suggestion to divide the proposed municipality into three
wards being condemned by some, and the titles of chairman and coun-
cillors being preferred by others to those of mayor and aldermen —the
latter falling for the time into disfavour as savouring of turtle-eating
propensities. After some discussion a committee was appointed to corre-
spond with the Government respecting the retention of wharfage and
ferry dues, and other reservations ; to consider if a municipality were
desirable, and to report the result to a subsequent meeting. An adjourn-
ment then took place to the following February, to afford time for the
committee to perfect their work. They were, however, ready on January
19, 1859, when they reported in favour of a municipality and its division
into three wards, and the designation of the new municipal representa-
tives as chairman and councillors. On the adoption of this report being
moved at a meeting called to receive it, great dissension arose, and an
amendment was moved that a municipality would be premature. When
the chairman of the meeting declared the amendment to be carried a
division was called for, and a scene of confusion arose which rendered a
further adjournment necessary, A third meeting was held in a few days,
when no satisfactory decision seems to have been arrived at, although the
opponents of a municipality claimed the victory. Ultimately, a petition
in favour of incorporation, signed by the principal holders of property
in the town, was sent to the Governor of New South Wales, who left
it as a matter to be dealt with by the authorities of the new colony,
and it was not until March, 1860, that Ipswich was proclaimed a munici-
pality.
The first Brisbane meeting was held in the School of Arts on De-
cember 13,-1858, and, in the words of the notice, to consider the pro-
priety of petitioning for the application of the Act to Brisbane. The
petition brought forward was opposed on the ground that the then pros-
pect of speedy separation rendered it inexpedient to take any such step.
The opposition, however, was for the time fruitless. Much public corre-
spondence then took place on the value of the properties to be assessed,
and the probable expense of a corporation, the modest sum of £550 per
annum being set down by one side for salaries, of which the mayor was


to receive £2OO ; while on the other it was predicted that the cost of ad-
ministration would absorb the proceeds of the rates. A counter petition
was prepared, circulated, signed, and forwarded ; the signatures for and
against incorporation being 181 and 210. On the publication of the pro-
testing document in the Government Gazette , a large and noisy meeting
was held in the School of Arts, ostensibly for the purpose of enquiring
into the genuineness of the signatures attached to it, but principally to
carry a memorial to the Government, in which that genuineness was denied.
Some effect was produced by the reading of a letter from the Colonial
Secretary of New South Wales, in reply to an application for a grant of
money towards the repair of the water-reservoir. It was a curiosity in
its way—erroneous in its premises, logical in its conclusions, terse and
dogmatic in its expression. Starting with the assumption that “ any
place possessing a considerable share of population would necessarily in-
corporate itself under the Municipalities Act, in which case water supply
would properly fall within the duties of the Corporation, and that when a
district was not sufficiently advanced for the purpose, expenditure of the
kind would be unjustifiable.” It proceeded,—“ either Brisbane is in such
an advanced state or it is not ; if it is, then it should be incorporated—
and if it is not, money should not be expended in supplying it with
water.” Ultimately, the meeting condemned the counter petition ; and a
memorial to the Governor, denying its integrity, was decided upon. This,
apparently, had the desired weight—for after some delay, and on Sep-
tember 7, 1859, the Municipality of Brisbane was proclaimed. The first
election took place on October 12, and the poll, declared on the 13th, gave
names of the following gentlemen as those of the first Municipal Council
in Queensland: —John Petrie, Patrick Mayne, T. B. Stephens, Joshua
Jeays, A. J. Hockings, G. Bdmondstone, E. Cribb, Geo. Warren, and W. S.
Sutton. Of these at this time four survive—Messrs. T. B. Stephens, Jeays,
Mayne, Warren, and Sutton no longer live to see the result of the labours
they assisted in initiating. At the first meeting of the Council Mr. Petrie
was unanimously elected Mayor.
I have given more space to the preliminary proceedings of the first
two municipalities than I should have done had they not been the first,
for generally the course in such matters is so nearly the same in all cases that
it requires very special circumstances to justify special notice of any par-
ticular one. Here, as it seemed to me, an unusual interest did attach to the
two in question, because they were the first in the colony ; and, perhaps,
their not least noticeable characteristic was that, even at a period when
the desire for self-government was apparently most intense, there was no
inconsiderable number in the two principal towns in the district who were
averse to the responsibilities it involved, while the rest, if disposed to


enjoy the privilege, were equally so to, if possible, enjoy it with as little
of the expense it might incur as could well be managed.
During this, what may be called anticipatory, period, there was a sort
of feverish excitement as to the existence of a payable goldfield within,
or nigh to, the boundaries of the district. Occasional finds, as at Boonoo
Boonoo and Tooloom on the New England side, roused the public antici-
pations, only to disappoint them ; but the year 1858 was remarkable for
one of the most extraordinary manias that has ever raged since the first
discovery of gold in New South Wales. From a letter to the Government
from Captain O’Connell, who, on the abolition of the Government resi-
dentship at Port Curtis, had been appointed Commissioner of Crown
lands, it appears that that gentleman having occasion to make an official
tour in the North, in November, 1857, took with him a practical miner,
and in the course of his explorations obtained about a pennyweight of fine
gold. Following upon this, the people of Gladstone subscribed a fund to
enable a party of six persons to prosecute the search. On July 28, 1868,
the Commissioner was enabled to say, from private information, that an
easily accessible and remunerative goldfield was discovered. Other cor-
respondence with mercantile firms spoke in sanguine language of the
diggings as the best in the colony. In the Courier of the same date it
was reported that gold in good-sized nuggets had been found at Canoona ;
and that at a meeting held at Gladstone to receive the report of the
explorers, who attended with their specimens, they gave as their opinion
that men could on those diggings earn from fifteen to twenty shillings per
day. As the site of the goldfield was only seven miles from the Fitzroy
River, and thirty from the then forming township of Rockhampton, con-
siderable excitement was caused by the intelligence. Towards the end of
August came “reliable news.” The miners on the spot, who now
numbered about eighty, were reported to be in good spirits, and positive
of success—one of them making sixteen ounces in as many days; and
soon after Gladstone was described as deserted. Early in September
about eighty ounces of gold arrived in Sydney, and immediately the
Yarra Yarra and Pirate , steamers, and nine sailing vessels, were laid on
for the diggings, and the newspapers began to speculate on the result;
the Sydney Herald suggesting that Gladstone would probably be the
capital of the proposed northern colony, and the Courier finding strong
reasons for believing that, “ in the final adjustment of the colonial boun-
.daries, New South Wales would be bounded, on the north, by the 30th
parallel, and that Port Curtis would be a new political centre for a colony
immediately to the northward of Cooksland.” Private letters continued
to bring, in vague terms, favourable accounts of the capabilities of the
new field, and fresh parties of diggers began to pour in. Nine vessels


were laid on at Melbourne, and both from that port and Sydney a rush of
a most formidable character set in. By September 21, fifteen hundred
persons had left Sydney for the new field. On the 27th, the arrival in
Brisbane of Mr. Hamilton Eamsay (lately a Northern goldfields warden),
who had travelled overland from Canoona, with one hundred ounces of
gold, startled the people from their usual staid propriety, and a meeting
was proposed to concert measures for establishing a regular line of com-
munication between Kockhampton and Moreton Bay, commencing with a
steamer and at least two schooners. In vain was it pointed out that,
after all, the yield of gold was insignificant compared with the number
engaged in searching for it; the warning was received with a pitying
incredulity. But the news began to fluctuate in its character before the
crowds who had left Victoria began to arrive ; the excitement on the
goldfields of that colony, caused by the first and most flattering intelli-
gence, being only to be described as intense. From Sandhurst, from
Castlemaine, from Ballarat, and from their tributary goldfields, continuous
lines of diggers were encountered on the roads to the ports. When they
were questioned why, they could only say that they were going to the
Canoona ; but, as to the nature of that goldfield, or the yield that had
been, or was likely to bo, obtained from it, vague rumours and ridiculous
exaggerations were all that was to be got from them. Men left claims
returning them an average wage, withdrew their money from the Savings
Bank, shouldered their swags, and started on the tramp, without being
able to assign the most remote approach to a tangible cause for their pro-
cedure. The Victorian journals denounced this folly, and insisted upon
the prudence of waiting for more certain information, while some of them
had recourse to such intimidation as might be obtained from doleful
descriptions of the climate and general unhealthiness of the new field ;
indeed, from some accounts by travellers professing to have had personal
experience in the north of Australia, Moreton Bay generally, and its
northern country especially, might be supposed as fertile in only two
products—sweet potatoes and snakes. But it was all in vain. Twenty-
five sailing vessels and three steamers were reported as laid on at one time
at Melbourne for Rockhampton, and on the miners continued to pour,
until the news reached Melbourne that the first arrivals found only a
small and worked-out field. In the meantime, the influx of population
rendered some attempt at government indispensable. An assistant gold
commissioner, a sub-gold commissioner, a sub-collector of customs, and a
landing-waiter and tide-surveyor, and a small police force, were sent to
Rockhampton, which had been proclaimed a township. Captain
O’Connell, who had been gazetted, on September 17, as a gold com-
missioner, forwarded a report on the 27th, in which, while still expressing


faith in the field, he confessed that he looked with some alarm at the
unusual numbers said to be on their way, and feared that much disap-
pointment and individual distress would be the result. By the middle of
October it was known, both in Brisbane and Sydney, that the supposed
auriferous wealth of the district existed principally in the imagination,
and that great misery existed there ; while a considerable number of the
later arrivals returned by the vessels in which they came. There was
some tendency to riot, and much wrath indulged in, at, what was termed,
a swindling imposition. The inexcusable and unaccountable folly of the
angry men was really most to blame. Captain O’Connell had much
trouble in dealing with the dissappointed adventurers, and his treatment
of them was eulogised in the Melbourne Argus, at the time, as equally
firm and conciliatory. On October 7 the numbers on the diggings were
reduced to between four and five hundred ; by the 15th they were reduced
to two hundred and fifty, and thereafter, by degress, the field became
deserted. In all, not less than ten thousand people were reported as
having been attracted to the shores of the Fitzroy by this extraordinary
delusion. One good resulted from it. A site was surveyed for a township
at Rockhampton, and the first laud sales were held in Sydney on
November 17 and 18. Captain O’Connell became again Resident at Port
Curtis, and the other gold commissioners, I presume, went their ways.
When the land sale was held a great number of lots were offered, and
nearly all were sold. The average prices were, for half an allotment
facing the river, £7O ; and for back allotments, £l7.
During, and after, this, efforts were made, from time to time, to fit
out searching parties, and rewards were offered for the discovery of gold,
but without any tangible result. Reports more or less encouraging came
in, and there the matter usually ended. Accident, then as now, had most
to do in confirming the inferences of science ; and, as yet, no lucky
traveller stumbled over a nugget half-buried in his track, and brown -with
the colouring with which long exposure had invested it. I imagine that
desire so quickened credulity that, in some instances, the gold seekers,
real or supposed, traded not unprofitably on the product.
Disappointed, as they might be, at the failure of every experimental
search for gold, and by the rapid exhaustion of such fields as, from time
to time, excited their hopes, the people of the then northern districts still
had, in the gradual development of their trade springing from the extend-
ing occupation of the country, some consolation. They were able to point
to their tables of exports with the satisfaction that their increasing columns
might be supposed calculated to produce. Although, possibly, it was
somewhat dimmed by the monotonous character of the articles exported—


a monotony which scarcely bespoke the existence of an intelligent enter-
prise in the community in which it occurred. Still, if we look at the
progress made in the interval between the time that the district was
opened for settlement and the date of separation, it had, under all the
disadvantages which had to be contended against, been quite sufficient to
justify the anticipation that when they were removed there awaited the
young colony a busy and prosperous career.
There had, to be sure, been little effort at increasing the varieties of
industry of which the soil and climate and natural product were suscep-
tible. Cotton languished of good symptoms, and when Mr. Fleming
established a flour-mill in connection with his saw-mill on the Bremer
Eiver, near Ipswich, he imported wheat from Adelaide for grinding. Dr.
Hobbs utilised the oil of the dugong (a marine animal sufficiently curious
to justify a particular description in a future chapter) for medical pur-
poses, and at one time indulged in the hope that it would become a
valuable export; but no sooner were its qualities appreciated than
wretched imitations were manufactured to such an extent, that a greater
quantity was sold in Melbourne alone than was procured in Moreton Bay,
Immigration to the district was languid. Dr. Lang’s land and immigra-
tion bill was brought before the New South Wales Parliament once more,
and some extension of the powers conferred by it seems to have been
sought, but the advent of Separation left the scheme a legacy to the
future Queensland Parliament, before whom it never, as a project, came ;
and finally, except as to its value as indicating a system, it vanished in
the limbo which awaits the efforts of all who have the misfortune to be
a little in advance of their time, and to have sufficient enthusiasm or folly
not to perceive their position. The irregularity, fraud, and inhumanity
which characterised much of the management of the German immigration
to the colony evoked Legislative inquiry and Legislative censure, but too
late to exert any effect upon the system as respected Moreton Bay.
The black population were, during this period of transition, at con-
stant war with the squatters and settlers. In October, 1857, they attacked
a station at Hornet Bank, on the Dawson, where they murdered eleven
persons, only one of the unfortunate family who were settled there being
left. In the Burnett and the Leichhardt districts they were continual
causes of terror. A committee of the New South Wales Legislative
Council was appointed to enquire into and report upon this most unsatis-
factory state of things ; but their labours had no practical result;
philanthropy and economy combining to leave the aboriginal marauders
to work their will, and thus a war of reprisals, sometimes ending in exter-
mination, became almost a matter of necessity. The outlying districts


were left, in great measure, unprotected, or only intermittently and
inefficiently guarded, up to the date of separation.
In the towns the efforts at social advancement were, if not always
judicious, yet not without zeal. There was sometimes a plethora of
lectures at the Brisbane School of Arts, some of which, if I am to judge
by the printed reports—in the majority of cases apparently verbatim—
would have been instructive, had they awakened interest. A choral
society was formed, and seems to have been at least temporarily suc-
cessful. Another School of Arts was inaugurated at Ipswich, not without
much dispute and bickering ; and a third at Toowoomba, where a gift by
Mr. Handcook of a site tended greatly to dulcify the proceedings. The
religious element in the little society was stimulated to unwonted activity
by the late Rev. B. G. Wilson’s arrival in Brisbane to take charge of the
Baptist congregation there on September 12, 1858 ; and about that time
considerable energy was shown in advocating the indispensability to the
Christian of adult baptism and immersion. Whether it was that the tenet
itself was unwelcome to Mr, Wilson’s clerical contemporaries, or the way
in which it was enforced by its adherents, disliked, it is not now necessary
to enquire ; whatever might be the cause, the air became darkened with
controversy ; sermons, lectures, pamphlets, and advertisements followed
each other in quick and inharmonious succession. One pamphlet, in par-
ticular, entitled “ Whither are we drifting ?” in which the resources of
typography, in capitals and italics, were emphatically “displayed” in
illustration of the arguments, eliciting a running fire of replies and
rejoinders highly profitable to the proprietors of newspapers, whose
theology was not ardent enough to induce them to insert the rival produc-
tions in any other guise than that of advertisements. Possibly, from this
cause, the dispute in time languished, and the ecclesiastical condition
resumed its usual quietude. Yet all the energy was not of one kind.
The building of chapels proceeded. St. Paul’s Church, Ipswich, was
finished and opened ; and if the new buildings did not add much to the
architectural beauty of their respective localities, they bore much testi-
mony to the liberality of those who subscribed towards their erection.
Unconnected with the circumstances I have just alluded to, though con-
nected with the general subject, was the erection of Brisbane into a
Roman Catholic See, and the election of Dr. James Quinn as its Bishop,
both of which were duly notified by Archbishop Folding in a pastoral
dated August 26, 1859.
The contributions of the New South Wales Government to the public
progress were few. The harbour of Moreton Bay remained as it was, but
some efforts were made to improve the navigation of the Brisbane and


Bremer by the removal of fallen timber and other obstructions. A new
Court-house was built at Ipswich, and the long-promised new gaol at
Brisbane was commenced. It may be regretted that the chronic procras-
tination of the authorities had not been still more marked as to the gaol,
which might well have claimed the bad eminence of being about the
worst for its purpose of such buildings in the colonies—whether as regards
health, convenience, or supervision. The colonial architect’s office in
Sydney was not at that time distinguished by any special ability, either
in invention or copyism, but it is fair to add that the Governor was said
to have assisted in deciding upon the arrangement of the unlucky struc-
ture. In the Lands Department a proposal to lease the islands of Moreton
Bay was resisted with more than usual vigour, and the attempt was aban-
doned. An application for a Ilecrcation Eeserve and Botanic Gardens at
Ipswich was more successful.
Some changes took place consequent upon the appointment of Mr.
Justice Lutwyche as the resident Judge. On October 12, 1859, circuit
courts were proclaimed at Ipswich, Drayton, and Maryborough, to the
great relief of all who were interested in litigation in the places named ;
and the salaries of the Crown Prosecutor and the Sheriff, which had been
fixed at absurdly low amounts, were raised to sums more proportionate
to the responsibility of their positions : the first from £2OO per annum to
£SOO, the second from £l5O to £450. Outside legal promotions, I notice
the advancement of Mr. Duncan, who had been many years Collector of
Customs here, to the headship of the department in Sydney, his place
being taken by Mr. Wm. Thornton, who has retained it ever since.
From law and government to literature is a transition more easy than
the reverse one ; and I now chronicle the issue of two new journals in the
colony—the Darling Downs Gazette, the first number of which was pub-
lished in Drayton, on June 11, 1858 ; and the Ijgswich Herald, which
commenced a not very lengthened career on July 4, 1859. The Darling
Downs Gazette was started by Mr. Lyons, the originator, as I have nar-
rated, of the Courier, but his new speculation seems to have resulted in as
little profit to himself as credit to some of his supporters. The Courier
itself twice changed its management during the period whose history is
comprised within this chapter. Mr. Charles Lilley, the present Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court, in partnership with Mr. Belbridge, a printer
of some reputation, rented it from Mr. Swan, on October 1, 1857 (fifteen
months after Mr. Labouchere’s despatch announcing the determination of
the Imperial Government to separate Moreton Bay from New South
"Wales), but after a year’s trial surrendered it back into his hands. The
only good that seemed to have resulted from this, said the North Austra


lian, was that the issue had become tri-weekly, and the circulation had
increased—not a singular instance of how a sneer sometimes uninten-
tionally conveys a compliment. On October 1, 1859, Mr. Swan sold the
paper to the late Mr. T. B. Stephens, in whose hands it remained about
fifteen years. I have omitted to mention that Mr. Wilkes had retired
from the editorship—leaving the district for Sydney. The year 1859 is
also noticeable as that in which the first issue of the well-known Pugh's
Almanac took place —a work which, well commenced, was carried on
with great completeness and success by Mr. Pugh for some years, and
under its present management maintains its reputation as one of the best
periodicals of its kind in the colonies.
The year XBSS was marked by one of the most bold and successful
explorations in the history of Australian adventure. The anxiety ex-
pressed as to the fate of Leichhardt had strengthened with the lapse of
time, until, at length, the Government of New South Wales determined on
an expedition in search of what traces might remain of him and his party.
The expedition was placed in charge of Mr. A. C. Gregory, who, after
some unavoidable delays, collected his party and completed his arrange-
ments towards the end of March. The expedition comprised eight persons
besides himself, and they took with them thirty-one pack-horses and nine
saddle horses —the pack-horses carrying at first an average load of 150 lbs.
each. The provisions for the journey were the dried meat of two bullocks
and four sheep, reduced by removing the bones and drying to 300 lbs.;
500 lbs. bacon, 160 lbs. flour, 100 lbs. rice, 350 lbs. sugar, 60 lbs. tea, 40
lbs. tobacco, and some minor articles. The other equipments were of
the simplest and lightest practicable kind. Leaving Juandah, the Messrs.
Eoyds’ station, on the Dawson, they crossed the basaltic ridge that divides
the eastern waters flowing to that river from those trending to the west
into the basin of the Maranoa, a tributary of which they followed west-
ward, and reached the river itself in latitude 25 deg. 41 min. Thence
they found a practicable route to the tributaries of the Warrego, and pur-
sued their course to the Nive, and SNW. until they reached the Victoria
of Mitchell, when they found the bed of the river scarcely ten yards wide,
and perfectly dry. Continuing their route along the Victoria, and
examining the country on both sides, they came not far from latitude 24
deg. 27 min. longitude 146 deg. 13 min., on a marked tree, and other
traces of one of Leichhardt’s camps. They then struck upon the Alice
Eiver, and followed it down to its junction with the Thompson, up which
they continued their route—
“ Nothing could be more desolate than the aspect of the country.
Except the few trees which grew on the immediate bank of the river,


there was scarcely a tree left alive, while the plains were quite bare of
vegetation, except a few salsolaceous bushes. At the distance of five
miles low ridges of red drift sand showed the desert character of all
around ; even the lower surfaces of the clouds assumed a lurid tinge from
the reflection of the bare surface of red sand. . . . We. how r ever,
succeeded in reaching latitude 23 degs. 47 mins., when the absence of
water and grass—the rain not having extended so far north, and the
channels of the river separating into small gullies, and spreading on the
wide plains—precluded our progressing further north or west, and the only
prospect of saving our horses was to return south as quickly as possible.”
They then determined to follow the Thompson down to trace its
outlet, thinking that Leichhardt, under similar circumstances, might have
been driven to the south-west. The journey was harassing and toilsome ;
but, at length, reaching the branch of Cooper’s Creek, named by Sturt
Streletzki Creek, they travelled mostly along it until its junction with
Lake Torrens, and thence to Adelaide, where they were received with
great enthusiasm. I regret that my space will not admit of copious
extracts from Mr. Gregory’s report of the journey whoso results, with
reference to the physical geography of Australia, were most important ;
but his conclusion as to the fate of Leichhardt cannot well be omitted—
“ With reference to the probable fate of Dr. Leichhardt, it is evident
from the existence of the marked camp nearly eighty miles beyond those
seen by Mr. Hely, that the account given to that gentleman by the
natives of the murder of the party was untrue, and I am inclined to think
only a revival of the report current during Leichhardt’s first journey to
Port Essington. Nor is it probable that they were destroyed until they
had left the Victoria, as, if killed by the natives, the scattered bones of the
horses and cattle would have been observed during our search. lam
therefore of opinion that they left the river at the junction of the Alice,
and, favoured by thunder showers, penetrated the level desert country to
the north-west, in which case, on the cessation of the rain, the party
would not only be deprived of a supply of water for the outward journey,
but be unable to retreat, as the shallow deposits of rain water would
evaporate in a few days, and it is not likely that they would commence a
retrograde movement until the strength of the party had been severely
taxed in the attempt to advance.”
In 1839, a party was fitted out, headed by the late George Elphin-
stone Dalrymple, to explore the country on the Burdekin, and ascertain
its suitability for pastoral occupation. They were, I believe, well satisfied
with the capabilities of the district; but the early laud legislation of the
colony interfered with the realization of their views as to investment or
occupation.
I have said that although the general question of separation was
settled by Mr. Labouchcre’s despatch, there was much uncertainty as to
the adjustment of its details. To this result the resolutions initiated by


Mr. Hargreaves, and carried through the Sydney Legislature, as I have
before described, in no small degree contributed. These were reinforced
by petitions from the border districts, whose appropriation was in dispute
and hostile to separation from the parent colony ; in that of New Eng-
land, especially, great efforts were made to procure signatures, and, in
many instances, with a total disregard of honesty in attaching them—a
considerable number of those who signed, or were supposed to have
signed, living to the south of the boundary suggested, and having, in
reality, no status in the matter. A counter petition from the Clarence
district, signed by the great majority of the residents there, seems to have
been treated as so much waste paper. Early in 1858, a petition from the
people of Brisbane was prepared for presentation to the Queen, in which
they asked that the final appropriation of the disputed districts might be
deferred until their population reached ten thousand souls. To this, most
of the members for the Moreton Bay constituencies demurred, as likely to
be productive of further delay. The local committee at first stood firm,
and adhered to their petition ; but, in a few weeks, reflection brought
about a more practical view of affairs. On November 3, 1858, a large
meeting was held in Brisbane, at which the local members attended, and
a new memorial to Her Majesty was adopted, in which the petitioners
stated that they did not wish, by pressing the question of boundary, to
occasion further delay. This meeting was followed by another at Ipswich,
on the 17th, at which all the questions connected with separation were
entered into temperately and deliberately. With reference to the neces-
sity for the immediate completion of the arrangements promised by the
Imperial Government, a strong representation to the Colonial Office, by
gentlemen in London connected with Moreton Bay, of the evils resulting
from the existing uncertainty was quoted, and its statements and argu-
ments reiterated. A petition to the Queen, more elaborate and detailed
than that of the Brisbane meeting, was adopted, the boundary question
being dealt with in a similar manner ; and a memorial to the Governor-
General, protesting against the manufactured petitions to which I have
referred, and asking for a reconsideration of the subject, was agreed to.
After these meetings the agitation subsided, and the people settled down
into an attitude of dull expectation.
In May, 1859, this torpor was disturbed by news that the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, in the then Derby administration, was about to
bring in a Bill for the immediate separation from Now South Wales of all
the country east of the South Australian boundary, north of a line drawn
westerly from Point Danger, granting the people a government analogous
to that of the parent colony, and appointing commissioners to arrange the
settlement of the public debt. That such a notion could have existed


seems, to me, extraordinary, inasmuch as no such bill was necessary, the
Constitution Authorization Act giving full power to the Queen in Council
to adopt such measures as might be necessary towards the creation of a
new colony. There was little time left for those who really understood
the subject to digest the perplexity which the intelligence was calculated
to cause. On July 10 came the welcome news, and none the less welcome
because unanticipated, that an Order in Council had been issued, by
which the long desired boon was conferred. In the new colony it was
received with wildness of delight; in New South Wales with a sullen
captiousness, which found vent in grumbling over the possible apportion-
ment of the public debt. Letters patent creating the colony of Queens-
land, and appointing Sir George Ferguson Bowen its first Governor, were
approved by an Order in Council of May 13, 1859, and on June G a second
order was made, empowering the Governor to make laws, and provide for
the administration of justice within the territory. The long struggle,
which had been fought with such fluctuating results, was entirely at
an end.
The boundaries adopted satisfied neither the old colony nor the new
one. The Clarence and Richmond and New England districts were left
to their old connection ; but the hope that had been once entertained by
New South Wales of compensation for the withdrawal of Moreton Bay in
the formation of new settlements in the extreme north was extinguished
by the extension of the Queensland boundary to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
One result of the alteration of the line to the south was discovered when
it was too late to remedy its mischievous consequences. The residents on
the border between New England and the Darling Downs districts not
infrequently found their properties divided by the boundary adopted,
and were exposed to all the disadvantages which such a division entailed.
They complained that to have the simplest petty sessions case tried they
had to journey two hundred miles, being driven by the rugged nature of
the country to travel over a portion of the Queensland territory before
getting to an available route to the nearest court in New South Wales,
while a Queensland one might have been reached by a better road and in
a fourth of the distance. An official representation of these difficulties
was made to the elder government, accompanied by a proposal for re-
adjustment, but with no result.
As to the debt the Duke of Newcastle—who in the changes of home
politics had succeeded the late Lord Lytton—suggested that its appor-
tionment was a matter “strictly of a domestic nature,” and therefore
best dealt with at least in the first instance by the Legislature of the two
colonies. The appointment of a Commissioner by each with power to


name an umpire, seemed to his Grace a convenient procedure, looking at
the local nature of the subjects to he determined upon, and the Legis-
lature of New South Wales should, he thought, take the initiative. Should
it decline there would then be a case for parliamentary interference. In
that position the Imperial authorities left the question, and in that position
it has practically remained ever since.
On the third point, the form of government,—that in force in the
parent colony at the time —was, except as to the suffrage, adopted, with
some peculiarities in the details and initiation. By the Order in Council
of June 6, the Governor of New South Wales was authorised to summon
as the nucleus for the Legislative Council of Queensland such persons,
being not less in number than five, as he should think fit, and these were
to hold their seats for four years only. The Governor of Queensland was
empowered to add to the original number at his discretion, his nominees
having a life tenure. In order to constitute the first Legislative Assembly
the Governor of New South Wales was directed to fix the number of
members, the extent of the several electoral districts, and the distribution
of the representation ; and to take all necessary measures preliminary to,
and for, the conduct of the first elections. While the arrangements
requisite for these purposes were being made a question arose as to the
qualification for the suffrage. By an electoral Act passed in New South
Wales in 1858 that qualification was practically reduced to one of
attainment of the legal majority and a six months’ residence prior to
registration. But by the Bth clause of the Order in Council the qualifi-
cation of electors in the new colony was fixed at that defined in the
New South Wales Constitution Act, the minimum of which was a
lodgors’s tenancy at a ten pounds’ annual rental for six months previous
to registration. On reference to the judges they were unanimously of
opinion that the qualification fixed by the Constitution Act had to be
adhered to, and thus the new colony began with what those who call
themselves advanced politicians would look upon, as regards the electoral
right, as a retrograde step. In his official letter to Sir George Bowen on
the subject Sir William Denison seemed to regret that such a course had
to be adopted ; hut from subsequent correspondence I gather that he
was in reality firmly opposed to Universal Suffrage, and deprecated—
especially under our possible local circumstances—its introduction into
Queensland.
On December 20, 1859, Sir William Denison issued a proclamation
by which he constituted sixteen electoral districts in Queensland, and
allotted to them twenty-six members. I give the list, not exactly in the
order in which they appear in the proclamation, but in that of the adult

male population of the electorates, as shown by the first census taken of
the colony a year afterwards. The electorates then stood thus :
It is impossible to acquit Sir William Denison of the charges of un-
fairness and inconsistency brought against him when this distribution of
electoral power was published. That it was purposely designed to give
the then pastoral interest an overwhelming preponderance in the legis-
lature, and thus to strengthen the hold which their connection with the
banks and agency houses of New South Wales gave that colony upon
Queensland, was freely asserted, and there were few who doubted the fact.
Brisbane and its suburb Fortitude Valley were the only constituencies
that could be said to be at all independent of that interest —with perhaps
a portion of East Moreton ; and one can hardly help challenging the
equity which allotted to the Western Downs with its small population
two members, while the Burnett with four times the number of residents
had only equal representation. The Governor-General’s conduct was the
more inconsistent in that, but a few months before, he had deprecated
separation, because he considered the interest he now favoured to have no
fixed or abiding hold in the country but he had been sharply criti-
cized by the townspeople for the unfair statement, which had brought
upon him the tacit rebuke of the Colonial Office, under which he still
smarted, and forgiveness was not a prominent virtue of Sir William
Denison’s.
Although in point of date after the assumption of the governorship
of Queensland by Sir George Bowen, I record as a part of the initiatory
procedure, directed under the Orders in Council, the appointment to our
Legislative Council, by Sir William Denison, in May 1860, of Sir Charles
Q VOL. I.

Balfour, Francis Edward Bigge, Alfred Edward Compaigne, George
Fullarton, John James Gallow’ay, James Laidley. John Frederic Mac-
dougall, Robert George Massie, and William Henry Yaldwyn. And thus
ended the official connection of the Governor and Government of New
South Wales with the districts comprised in the colony of Queensland.
The people of that colony were quite willing to forgot their lately
dependent state in the exhilaration which accompanied the preparations
for initiating their new condition with due ceremony, and for the recep-
tion of their Governor, who was expected to arrive towards the close
of 1859. A house belonging to Dr. Hobbs (and now that gentleman’s
residence), at that time the best in the town, was taken for Sir George
Bowen’s occupation until a suitable residence could be built, and was
properly furnished. Reception committees were formed, addresses pre-
pared, entertainments arranged, and all seemed anxious to show his
Excellency how highly they appreciated his presence, and more highly
its cause. And leaving them thus occupied I close the general narrative
of this volume.

Observations and Conclusions.
The date at which the district was elevated into a colony affords a ter-
mination and a starting point, and we have therefore arrived at a suitable
stage of this history for recapitulation and review. Necessarily some
matters have been omitted—some could not conveniently be introduced
in the general course of the narrative —which is, therefore, so far, incom-
plete. I propose, therefore, in this chapter, to summarize the progress of
the district up to December, 1859, and to exhibit as clearly as I can its
actual condition at that time, Such a review affords an opportunity for
a divisional arrangement, which, while admitting of continuity in each
section, will not interfere with an accurate appreciation of general results,
and the student who has his special subject of inquiry will find this
information available, grouped under its special section. Some repetition
it will be impossible to avoid, but I venture to think that the shape in
which it occurs, will not be found tedious, while the concentration of
facts will facilitate reference.
The New South Wales census of 1816 gave the total population of
the districts, which were to form the foundation of our colony, as 2,257 ;
in 1857 another census stated the area of the territory available for occu-
pation as 58,860 square miles, and the population as 8,575. On March
1, 1856, the area proclaimed was 174,600 square miles, and the population
17,082, the occupied country having increased threefold and the numbers
of the people having doubled. On December 31, 1859, the population was
estimated with a near approach to accuracy at 25,020, showing a consid-
er*


erable falling off in the proportionate rate of increase. The area of the
Queensland territory was stated in the Queensland Statistical Register,
issued by Sir George Bowen, at 1,209,800 square miles ; but that calcula-
tion being made upon the assumption that the western boundary of this
colony would be the eastern one of Western Australia, and include the
large area since allotted to South Australia, was an erroneous one. Prac-
tically the country occupied was about the same in extent as at the census
of 1856.
Of the wealth of the colony at the period of its creation it is only
possible to speak approximately, as for an accurate estimate the statistics
I have referred to are valueless ; for instance, they take no account of the
pastoral riches scattered over the land. Taking the rate of increase main-
tained for some years, and the number of horses, sheep, and cattle, as
ascertained in 1860, as bases, I calculate that at the close of 1859 there
must have been about 20,000 horses, 300,000 cattle, and 2,000,000 sheep in
Queensland. The live stock on January 1, 1818, was, as we have seen
estimated at 698,938 sheep, 18,267 cattle, and 2,189 horses. The money
value of the stock in 1859, not taking the exceptional rates of 1860, might
be set down at two millions and a-half. The values of the properties
comprised within the two municipalities of Brisbane and Ipswich, at the
then current rates, I could not estimate as more than £900,000, and
in the gradually-growing townships in the interior and on the coast
—in all seven —at £350,000 more. The small quantity of land,
actually in cultivation, the insignificant mining works, and the
moveable property employed in industrial processes would be liberally
valued at another £IOO,OOO. As to the alienated land, of which
no use was made, and the theoretical worth of runs, it is impos-
sible to arrive at a valuation which would not appear absurdly
high to some, and as ridiculously low to others. At the close of
1859 the real prices were very much under what was asked and obtained
in the latter end of 1860, which, in their turn, greatly increased in 1861.
If I were to take the whole at half a million, it would be what, at the time
lam writing of, would have been found—a fair appraisement. In all, the
actual wealth of the community then presently available was about four
millions and a quarter sterling. For a population of 20,000 souls this
could not be pronounced other than a fair condition for a starting point.
Agriculture was at an exceedingly low ebb. Ido not think that more
than 2,000 acres out of 80,000 alienated from the Crown w T ere under cul-
tivation.* Maize was the principal crop. Potatoes, and oats for hay were
* On April 1,1861, when a great start had been made, there were only 3,351 acres.


next, but at a long interval; and about a fifth of the whole area might be
set down at what in England would be called orchards, in which bananas
occupied no small portion. There was a notion much encouraged in those
days by leading squatters, whose interest might be supposed to have been
promoted by the depreciation of agricultural settlement, that cultivation
in Queensland must necessarily result in failure—especially as to cereals
and fruit and vegetables of European origin—and from constant reitera-
tion it received considerable acceptance. In the two hotels, which accom-
modated the more exclusive visitors to Brisbane in 1859-60, a considerable
portion of the vegetables used were imported from Sydney—certainly
from an indolent acquiescence and not from necessity. As to cereals,
even in 1860 there were only eighteen acres of wheat in the Brisbane dis-
trict, and not a single acre anywhere else. Agriculture, if not altogether
despised, was generally looked upon as, in the main, experimental, and
the agriculturalist as an enthusiast or a weak-minded mistaken man.
“ Farming will never pay” was the authoritative enunciation of the wise
and prudent, and the babes received it with the submission that became
them. I w r as visiting at a station on the Darling Downs in 1860, and was
much surprised and disappointed when chatting in the evening with my
hospitable host at being told that the fine country over which I had been
riding was utterly unsuitable for anything but grazing. “It will not
grow a cabbage.” Taking an early stroll the following morning I found
a well-kept garden, in which some fine cabbages were not the least con-
spicuous objects, but on mentioning this at breakfast I was assured that
the growth was exceptional and expensive, and if cabbage-growing could
be done again, which was doubtful, it would not be worth the doing. And
this was the general burden of the song. It is but two days since that
we bought in Brisbane as fine cabbages as cook would desire to see at
little more than a halfpenny each- Some of us had faith in vegetables in
1860 ; now we know them experimentally, which some colonial Tyndall
might claim as a triumph of proof over belief ; but then no shower of
Chinese gardeners had fallen upon the land.
The growth of the trade of the district is less easily traced than that
of its population. The colonial Registrar-General in 1860 regretted that
he had “ access to no reliable records of our commerce in former years,”
but as we have seen the Courier gave occasional statements, and as these
were never effectively challenged, we are justified in accepting them as
bases for our estimates. The exports then may be calculated for the res-
pective years named in the following table at the values set against
them —excluding those from the Clarence and Richmond, which up to the
issue of the Orders in Council constituting the new colony were included
in what were called the northern districts—


1849 £120,000
1830 149,819
1851 181,030
1852 161,333
1853 , 353,362*
1854 ... ... ... ... ... ... no return
1835 (last quarter only) 130,446
1836 no return
1837 425,237
1858 468,210
1859 about 500,000
and the Statistical Register for the last month of 1839, which was the first
of Sir George Bowen’s governorship, gives the value of the exports for
that month at £50,738, of which 1,254 bales of wool contributed £48,410 ;
coal, to the East Indies, £330, and timber £430. Taking the ratio of
export value to population it would seem to have been about £2O per
head per annum. As to the imports I know of no means of obtaining
any information.
In so small a community one would hardly expect to find banking
transactions on any but the smallest scale. Four English and New South
Wales establishments had branches in the district —the Bank of Austra-
lasia, the Union Bank of Australia, the Australian Joint Stock Bank, and
the Bank of New South Wales. The average note circulation of the
whole may be taken at about £30,000; the deposits, £ 180,000; the liabilities,
£357,000 ; the notes and bills and debts due, £390,000. The coin was about
£50,000, and the bullion, apparently, nil. The Bank of Australasia had the
largest share of the business, the Australian Joint Stock Bank, the Bank of
New South Wales, and the Union Bank of Australia following in due
order. There were offices in Brisbane and Ipswich, those in the latter
town—in which at that time most business was transacted—being finer
buildings than in the capital, on which the Ipsvvichians congratulated
themselves and looked scornfully on the Brisbane claims. There are no
returns which show the operation of the Act authorizing liens on stock or
on wool, those effected in the district being registered in Sydney, up to the
date of separation from New South Wales, as far as I can learn.
There was not much room for the energies of the Protectionist in
Queensland in December 1859. There were at that time four steam saw-
mills, one soap manufactory (recorded as having made 5 tons of soap in
the year I) ; one candle factory, which turned out fifty thousand pounds
■weight of candles ; a struggling salt works ; two coal mines, the output
being about 5,000 tons, valued at £3,500 ; and a dugong fishery whose
* Probably from local causes, such as impediments to traffic, including a large quan-
tity of the preceding years produce.


returns are not extant. Population was wanted to develop the resources
of the country, and concerning the most effective methods of establishing
a speedy and useful immigration there was much discussion, and some
curious theories were propounded.
The system of civil government in the district at this time was
simple enough. The constitution had not, of course, come into direct
operation, and the departments were merely branches of the central
government of New South Wales. Captain Wickham ruled over Brisbane
and its connected districts; Captain O’Connell presided at Gladstone over
whatever was supposed to require supervision in the district of Port
Curtis, The number of employes did not then form a subject of un-
easiness to liberal politicians jealous for the liberty of the subject.
At the head office there was the superintendent and one clerk.
The Crown lands found work for five commissioners and eight land
agents ; the survey office for seven surveyors and one clerk and draughts-
man. The Customs employed one sub-collector and four subordinates,
and there was a board of works of two. The steam navigation board
numbered six officials and the immigration board three. The Botanic
gardens were entrusted to a committee of three and a superintendent.
There was one coroner to enquire into suspicious deaths, and two police
magistrates and twelve clerks of petty sessions to look after the suspected
amongst the living ; while for every description of ultimate jurisdiction
there was a judge of the Supreme Court and twelve officials of various
kinds. The post office did not too severely tax the energies of four de-
partmental officers, twelve local postmasters, and two letter-carriers. The
native police corps seems to have been a favourite one with the Govern-
ment of New South Wales. It had a commandant and a secretary, and
its five divisions were thus officered :—Port Curtis and Leichhardt, a first
lieutenant and six second lieutenants ; Wide Bay and Burnett, a first and
second lieutenant; Maranoa and Condamine, a first and two second lieu-
tenants ; and the Moreton Bay district one second lieutenant. Of the
ordinary police I find eleven chief constables set down for various places,
and I believe the ordinary corps could not have mustered more than
thirty. The gaol required the services of five superior officials, two
chaplains, and seven turnkeys. Two sheep inspectors were supposed to
guard against disease and infection in stock. Port Curtis had, besides
Captain O’Connell, nine officials, one being a police magistrate. The whole
of the official staff was not much beyond a hundred. If my readers
fear for the protection of the country with so small an administrative
corps they may perhaps take heart at the cloud of magistrates which
hovered over the land, for there were even then one hundred and fifty-
three gentlemen on the commission of the peace.


It will be observed that this very moderate administrative strength
left a fine field for official organisation by the new Government. How
this was taken advantage of will be seen hereafter. But the enthusiasts
for further separation may derive a warning and a lesson from a compari-
son between the executive strength of December, 1859, and that of
December, 1800. To be sure, there was not much activity to call forth
the energies of the public service. The expenditure on public works of
all kinds could not have been more than £IO,OOO in the eleven months
before separation, most of which seems to have been devoted to the gaol.
The collection of the then taxes must have been easy. Spirits, wines, ale,
porter, tea, sugar, treacle, molasses, coffee, chicory, cigars, tobacco, and
snuff comprising all the dutiable articles. The other sources of revenue
were of a kind that were brought, rather than collected. Altogether,
there must have been a good deal of placid resignation, accompanied by
an occasional folding of the hands and leisure for quiet introspection—if
that were enjoyable—amongst the civil service of those days ; and if its
salaries had not attained the high level in which some of its members
rejoice now, the duties were light—the responsibilities, for the most part,
nominal, and the plague of ministerial supervision and patronage was as
yet unknown.
The social condition of the people was, in great measure, what one
might suppose it would be, that of a quiet colonial country locality almost
unexpectedly roused to a mild excitement by the prospect of capital,
population, and enterprise, long worked for and wished for in vain. The
course of life was monotonous, unless a flood, or a drought, or an election
disturbed it. Public amusements, there were none, save such as might be
derived from the infrequent visits of a stroller or two—more seldom, of a
musical star. A School of Arts, with a small, but good, library, was kept
up in Brisbane with some success, and now and then a lecturer drew a
few people together, as much from curiosity as from taste. There was
another institution of the kind lodged in a temporary building at Ipswich,
and a feeble reflection at Toowoomba ; and, moreover, there was a volun-
teer mounted corps, whose evolutions certainly had the merit of keeping
the spectators in good humour. As in most such communities, there was
a sort of sectional division ; in this case having the superior portion of the
official element —the leading squatters, the older professional men, the
bank managers, some of the clergy, and one or two wholesale dealers on the
higher level. The middle stratum had its notabilities, and amongst these
arose most of the disputes which occasionally, to use a now proverbial
phrase, made things lively, when not varied by the eccentricities of lesser
legal and clerical lights. The general mass were, for the most part, quiet
in habit, moderate in expense, and, earning good wages, while the cost of


living was low, had less ground for real, than imaginary, discontent.
Leaving on one side those who found enjoyment in low pleasures—and
they were inconsiderable in number —there must have been a good deal
of self-contained life in those days. In truth, there could have been little
room for anything else. Travelling was slow, sometimes difficult, mostly
expensive, and in wet weather well nigh impracticable. I question
whether, outside of Brisbane, there was a mile of road in the colony—few
of the creeks were bridged, and, in more than one case, the bridge, how-
ever good in itself, was unapproachable, unless by a long detour from the
main track. Even in Brisbane the streets, so called, were, in great part,
passages between allotments where, sometime or other, buildings were
thought likely to be erected ; and their surfaces were as soft as their
verdure was fresh. They did not need watering, for there was no dust—
the luxuries of which primitive condition, I suppose, stimulated a candi-
date for aldermanic honours, some months afterwards, when increasing
traffic had made the roads more friable, to recommend that they should be
laid with turf to prevent the spread of the nascent nuisance—and the new
municipality had not commenced the work of road formation. As were
the ways of the metropolis, so were those of the interior townships, with
a plentiful admixture of stumps. Intercourse between the interior and
the coast towns was, in great part, dependent upon the weather, because
of the difficulties presented, not only by the usual tracks and by swollen
creeks, but by the passage of the Great Dividing Eangc and its spurs ; at
whose base or summit, teams have been kept for months unable to start
upon the ascent or descent. There was, in fact, every motive existent for
the colonist to seek his amusement at home, not the least being, some-
times, the impossibility of getting far away from it; and, sometimes, the
improbability of finding any improvement in his lot by going farther.
The arrival or departure of the steamer from or to Sydney—especially the
arrival —was a periodical source of amusement in Brisbane, at least to the
people, but the passengers occasionally viewed the matter in a different
light. A trip, now and then, on the river afforded a little variety ; omni-
buses and cabs being then unknown. One source of amusement, however,
existed in the newspapers, whose weekly or tri-weekly issues were eagerly
looked for. There was only one in Brisbane—the old Courier —whose
politics at the time were professedly liberal, which meant anti-squatting,
in the district, and of the Manchester school in other respects. It neither
meddled, nor assumed to meddle, with literature, properly so called, and
as to ecclesiastical matters, seemed to have inherited the feelings pre-
valent when—
Oyster women locked tlieir fish up,
And trudged away to cry no bishop.


The North Australian at Ipswich, fierce in defence of its own town, and
defiant of opposition, was, nevertheless, menaced by the rivalry of the
Herald , in the formation of which Mr. Macalister and some pastoral
friends took a leading part; and at Drayton the Darling Downs Gazette
sneered at the shopkeepers below the range, and advocated the claims of
the squatters. The principal peculiarity attached to this last journal at
the time was the curious nature of its accommodation—a wooden shanty
elevated on some piles, apart from the few houses of the place, and where
the music of the waving trees and the trickling waters of a creek below
were favourable to meditation, if not to comfort.
Of art there was nothing to notice ; no one looked for it, and no one
was disappointed. There had been neither call nor room for its develop-
ment. One exception might have been found in the little Roman Catholic
Chapel at Brisbane, which possessed some real character in the later
pointed style. Nevertheless, it was currently believed that there were
“ fine buildings,” and a traveller desirous of peace would not have ven-
tured to disturb the belief. No auctioneer offered pictures which, suppos-
ing them to have been genuine, would have been priceless, and “ chromos”
and oleographs, and the photograph in its more modem aspect, were all
unknown. The Illustrated News supplied, at once, art and criticism for
the people.
■ The community was not a litigious one. I remember only six or
seven solicitors in the Moreton Bay district, and, generally, legal proceed-
ings were carried on with a great deal of good humour on all sides, except
when the payment of costs ruffled the surfaces and, still more, the depths
below. There was not more than the average of criminality, when we
consider the special class from which it principally arose. 217 were com-
mitted—mostly for minor offences—during the year 1859 ; of whom, 7
were minors, 117 could not read, 6 had been convicted once before, IS
twice, and 39 three times or more. At Michaelmas, 1859, there were only
32 in confinement, all of whom had been tried—ll for felonies. As to the
physical health of the people, I have scarcely any available record to turn
to. There were only two hospitals in the colony—one in Brisbane, and
one in Maryborough—both sustained by Government grants, by voluntary
subscriptions, and by a portion of the fines received at some police courts.
At the Brisbane institution,-176 patients were admitted during the year,
21 seeming the average number of inmates ; while at Maryborough, 11
and 4 were the numbers respectively. I think there were only three or
four medical men in Brisbane, including the hospital surgeon ; two in
Ipswich, two or three on the Darling Downs, and one in Maryborough.
Accident, more than disease, was the source of practice, and there were


no earth-closets and no boards of health to squabble over their unsavory
merits or defects.
The educational system, inherited by the colony from New South
Wales, was, to a small extent, on what was'called the National system,
under a Board incorporated by the Act, 11 Vic., No, 48, the preamble
whereof recited the desirability of “ establishing schools to be conducted
under Lord Stanley’s system of National education.” The regulations
issued by the Board were not very voluminous ; the books directed to be
used seem to have been similar to those of the Irish National Schools, in-
cluding four sets of Scripture lessons, and lessons on the truths of
Christianity ; and for reading these, or for direct religious instruction by
ministers of religion, one hour each day was directed to be set apart. I
find no reference to matters special to Australia, to whose geographical
and physical characteristics it appears to have been thought unnecessary
to refer. The expenses of the National schools were defrayed partly by
the State, and partly by school fees and subscriptions, the striking pecu-
liarity in this part of the arrangement being the miserable stipends paid
to the teachers. Working contemporaneously with this system, was a
denominational one, in which the teachers’ salaries were supplemented by
the State, but the teacher seems to have been more at the discretion of
the authorities of the denomination under whose supervision the school
immediately was, provided a certain degree of efficiency were kept up.
The National system had not attained any great degree of public favour,
for I gather from the statistics for 1859, that there were in the new colony
at the time of its creation, six schools connected with the Church of
England, attended by 387 scholars ; four in connection with the Church
of Home, whose scholars were 354 ; one National school at the little
village—if village it could be called—of Drayton, with 78 scholars ; and
thirty private schools, which obtained between them 698 pupils. In all,
1,517 children were taught in the different schools, and of that number all
but 180 belonged to the towns. The ratio of attendance I am, from the
absence of statistics, unable to give. The general prevalence of the
denominational system spoke well for the exertions of those in the
churches with whom the primary steps for the establishment of schools
rested—they began well; the future, at least with respect to the Church
of England, had to tell a very different tale.
I now come to a division of my subject, into which I have gone more
particularly than may appear necessary to some of my readers ; but I
found in the course of my enquiries for the requisite facts that they were
to be collected from such a variety of sources, were so scattered, and, in
consequence, so little known, and, when known, lightly appreciated, that
it was indispensable, if anything approaching to an intelligent and useful


account was to be arrived at, to deal with the subject with more than
usual care, and in more than usual detail. I have never met with a con-
nected history of religious progress in Queensland, or any effort at tracing
its rise, and to this the difficulty of getting at the facts, as well as of dis-
criminating between different versions of the same fact, may in no small
degree have tended. I venture to think that the neglect which has been
betrayed by some, to whom the subject might be supposed to legitimately
belong, and the virulent partizanship of others, have contributed largely
to the mingled ignorance and indifference with which these important,
matters are often treated in this colony. I have, therefore, endeavoured
to arrive at a clear apprehension of the religious condition of the commu-
nity in 1859, and of the origin and progress of its different churches and
denominations amongst us ; so that, at least, some of the reproach which
attaches to an indolent non-appreciation should be wiped away.
Undoubtedly that condition was one, as exhibited in the contem-
poraneous statistics, to excite considerable surprise. Out of a population
of 25,020, the number of attendants on divine service was set down at
3,523,* and this was divided into—Wesleyans, 875 ; Church of Rome, 745 ;
Church of England, 6-13 ; Presbyterians, 4GO ; Baptists, 323 ; Congrega-
tionalists, 250 ; and Lutherans, 230. Eighteen churches and chapels are
enumerated, most of them recently-built structures of wood of an cxceed-
ingly primitive and unsubstantial kind, and where these were not forth-
coming court-houses and school-rooms, not more solid or attractive, were
used instead. In the whole district there were sixteen clergymen of
various denominations. The figures I quote from show only the condition
of the townships ; of services in the bush, on the stations, and at mere
outside places I have found no reliable record, and indeed they must have
been from the small number of ministers, irregular and infrequent.
The population returns are in direct contrariety to those of religious
attendance. At least, one-third of the whole number were nominally
members of the Church of England, a fourth Roman Catholics, about 13
per cent. Presbyterians, the Wesleyans coming next. Yet the Wesleyans
ranked the highest in the scale of religious activity—not a very creditable
fact to the principal churches, even giving due weight to the concentra-
tion of congregations in townships, whence it arose that 630 of the Wes-
leyan worshippers were set down for Brisbane alone.
State endowments for religious purposes were recognized by the
Legislation of Kew South Wales at the time in force in Moreton Bay, and
applied according to a system embodied in a series of acts known as Sir
* Queensland Statistics, December, 1859.


Richard Bourke's Acts, passed in 183 G-7. Sir Richard, who assumed tho
Governorship o£ the colony in 1831, was not long in finding that tho
jealousies of different churches and denominations, as well as the injustice
which had from time to time followed upon the whims and caprices of
some of his predecessors, were likely to be productive of serious evils, and
that the exclusive connection of the State with any particular church was,
in the local circumstances of the day, altogether out of the question. A
man of distinguished intellectual powers, great administrative ability, and
unswerving integrity and independence, he was the ablest statesman the
colonies have vet seen as a Governor.* After two years’ deliberation he
laid before the Imperial Government a scheme for the settlement of the
question, which in due time met with approval, and was soon after
brought into operation hy the General Churches Act (7 Wm. 1, No. 2,
N.8.W.), passed in 183 G, By this Act aid was authorized to be granted to
churches and religious bodies who might desire it in the following way :
Towards the erection of churches, chapels, or Ministers’ dwellings, in
sums equal to private contributions up to £IOOO in each case.
Towards the stipend of a minister of religion —vested interests in
stipends being had regard to —if there were a resident population of 100
adults subscribing a declaration of a desire to attend his church, £ 100 per
annum ; if there were 200 such adults, £2OO ; if 500 such adults, £3OO.
When no church or chapel existed it was to be discretional in the Govern-
ment to pay any sum not exceeding £IOO in aid of private contributions,
which, however, were not to be less than £SO.
Trustees were to be appointed to hold the real estate and to receive
and account for moneys issued under the Act.
Free sittings for the poor to the extent of one-fourth of the whole
were to be reserved in every church or chapel.
Subsequently the requirements of different churches led to supple-
mentary legislation to meet them in accordance with the specialities of
their organization ; but before describing how this was effected it is
necessary to enter more fully into the early history of each of the various
churches and denominations, which, so far as I am enabled, I proceed to
do in the order of their seniority or proportion to population.
The Church of England was planted in Australia in an uncongenial
soil and in troublous times. In the year 1793, eight years after the estab-
lishment of the convict settlement under Captain Phillip in Port Jackson,
some people in England, amongst whom was the celebrated William
* Sir Richard was hy descent in a collateral line connected with the celebrated
Edmund Burke, and was marked by much similarity of character to that of that illus-
trious man, four volumes of whose correspondence with the leading statesmen of his day
Sir Richard edited in conjunction with, I think, the late Earl Fitzwilliam.


Wilberforce, bethought themselves that when no provision had been made
for religious ordinances or instruction in a professedly reformatory system
something had been forgotten : and, as in a community of criminals and
gaolers, the voluntary principle was not likely to meet with much
support, the Government of the day were urged to make some effort
towards supplying the deficiency. But that Government, occupied by the
troubles and cost of the first French revolutionary war, and it is to be
supposed not unaffected by the general religious indifference of the times,
could only offer to provide for two chaplains on an economical or rather
parsimonious scale. Thus much achieved, a new difficulty arose. At first
no one at all suitable for such an appointment could be. induced to accept
it, and after one was found his coadjutor was not forthcoming. At this
time, however, there was at St. John’s College, Cambridge, a young
student waiting for holy orders named Samuel Marsden, in all time to
come to be inseparably identified with the commencement of Maori
civilization in New Zealand. Marsden was the son of a Yorkshire farmer
of small means, by whom he had been sent to the free Grammar School
at Hull. On leaving this he was started in life as a tradesman in Leeds,
but his vivacity and clearness of ii;tellect had gained for him the notice
of a society called the Elland Society, formed to aid in the education for
the ministry of young men of limited means, but of exceptionally good
character and ability, and of which Wilberforoe, Simeon, and Thoruton
were prominent members. By this Society he was sent to St. John’s,
where he was waiting for his degree, when, at the suggestion of Mr. Wil-
berforoe, one of the proposed chaplaincies was offered to him. He at first
shrank from' it, but no one being found to take the place, he undertook its
duties, and in the spring -of 1793 was ordained. Shortly afterwards,
being then twenty-nine years of age, he married and started for his des-
tination. He soon had a foretaste of what he was to encounter in the
opposition made to the performance of his ministerial duties, by the master
of the convict ship in which ho took his voyage, and when he had some
experience in the new settlement, then governed by Captain Hunter, he
discovered that that foretaste was but a mild indication of what he had
to undergo. His fellow-chaplain, after having had his house burned down
in return for his services, abandoned the task in despair. Hunter himself
found the state of things so unendurable that he returned to England in
the year 1800 to attempt the attainment of some reform, but he did not
come back to the colony, nor do I think that he met with much sympathy
at home. His successor, Captain King, encountered like evils and diffi-
culties, and on his return to England in, I believe, 180 C, Marsden, who
foresaw the results of the condition which culminated afterwards in the
revolt against, and deposition of, Governor Bligh by his own officers.


accompanied him in the hope of obtaining some amelioration and im-
provement. The utmost he could then secure was that the convicts
should be taught trades, and that three chaplains and two schoolmasters
should be sent back with him. Any other suggestions, especially in a
moral or educational direction, were rejected as enthusiastic or visionary
by the practical men of the day. Yet, at that time there were probably
10,000 inhabitants, mostly convicts, or, too frequently when not so, very
little better, in New South Wales.
In another direction he was successful beyond his hopes, and, as I
have said in an early chapter of this history, is entitled to share with
Macarthur the honour generally claimed solely for him of laying the
foundation of the growth of the great staple export of the Australian
colonies —wool. What he valued more was that the profit from his far-
seeing enterprise helped, in no small degree, to supply means for carrying
into effect his schemes for the improvement of the prisoners, and the pro-
motion of his missionary enterprises in New Zealand, which he at this
time originated. Into the history of his efforts in that direction, his various
trials and considerable success, the nature of this work precludes me from
entering. In the opinion of those capable of judging, he is declared to
have been a worthy predecessor of the great and good Selwyn. What is
there to be added of eulogy to such praise 1
It was not long after his return to New .South Wales that he found
himself in collision with Governor Macquarie, who, for twelve years, ruled
the colony with vigour, not infrequently diverging into despotism. He
would have been ecclesiastical director, as well as civil superior, and often
endeavoured to interfere in religious matters over which he had no rightful
control. These attempts were steadfastly resisted by Marsden, who, at
the same time, saw much to be dissatisfied with in the way in which
Macquarie too frequently postponed moral reform to mere material pros-
perity in his estimate of the character of his hybrid population. And
Macquarie was not one to tolerate opposition. A system of detraction and
abuse on his part, and, at last, of direct accusation by himself, resulted in
the issue of two commissioners from England, from whose enquiries
Marsden came out, not only with acquittal, but with approval and reward.
He did not escape disagreement with Governor Brisbane, but after that
governor's recall lived in peace and honour, and to the end in useful
activity until May 23, 1838, when, after nearly half a century of min-
isterial and missionary labour, he died at Windsor, in New South Wales.
Forty years afterwards I heard him spoken of with affectionate respect by
some whose age was such that, in their early days, they had participated
in a kindness which they still appreciated, while they remembered a good-
ness which they had not forgotten to reverence.


But, before his death, Marsdcn had one great wish gratified, and it
befel thus : In the year 1813, the exertions of Wilberforce and his friends
had enlisted the public interest in the condition of the East Indian pos-
sessions of Great Britain, and the responsibility of the Church of England
with regard to them. In 1811 the first Bishop of Calcutta—Thomas
Fanshaw Middleton, beforetime Archdeacon of Huntington—was ap-
pointed, not without many misgivings, on the part of that excellent man,
as to his ability to discharge the duties of so novel and so arduous a posi-
tion, Ho was to be assisted by three archdeacons, one in each of the
cities of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. In 1821, as I collect, he received
a petition from Marsdcn, bringing before him the requirements of New
South Wales ; and arrangements were made for the establishment of an
archdiaconate of Australia in subordination to the See of Calcutta. The
Bishop dying in 1822, there arose some delay in making the necessary
appointment, and it was not until 1825 that the Reverend Thomas Hobbes
Scott received it; but of the character or results of his administration, I
have no record. He was succeeded in 1829 or 1830, by Archdeacon, after-
wards Bishop, Broughton, a man of sound judgment, an ardent church-
man, but with greater liberality of feeling than he has been generally
credited, and, withal, of quiet sustained energy and determination of
purpose—qualities all called into action by the transitional circumstances
of the times, and by the discontent felt at the special advantages then
accorded to the Church of England. He was fortunate in that the inevi-
table changes were, so to speak, in the hands of Sir E. Bourke. Partly
in connection with those matters, and, partly, in consequence of the
inconvenience and increasing inadequacy of the then episcopal arrange-
ments, Archdeacon Broughton found it necessary to visit England in
1833, when it was determined to create an Australian See, of which he
was consecrated the first bishop, in February, 1836. Some of Marsden’s
friends complained that he was passed by, but the good old man, then
more than seventy years of age, participated in no such vain regrets. He
knew that the fullest possible vigour, both of mind and body, is required
in our colonial episcopate, especially in the formation and settlement of
new dioceses, and that an infirm frame and enfeebled intellect are poor
endowments for the performance of the duties which that work entails.
The reader will have observed that, subsequently to the passing of the
General Churches Act, supplementary legislation was found necessary to
meet the special requirements of the several ecclesiastical bodies in-
terested in it. That legislation was in 1839, and, in part, is at present in
force in the colony ; and it may be as well at this stage to recapitulate,
as briefly as possible, its principal provisions as respects the Anglican
Church in Queensland.


The Acts in which they are embodied are technically known as the
8 Wm. IV., No. 5, N.S.W., 1837, and the 21 Vic., No. 4, N.S.W., 1857. The
first Act empowers any person or persons providing at his or their own
expense a church or chapel approved by the bishop of the diocese, or any
minister’s dwelling, glebe land, or burial ground, to nominate five persons
as trustees thereof ; or any number of persons subscribing not loss than
three hundred pounds towards such purposes to elect like trustees by the
voting qualification—until, in the case of a church or chapel, the com-
pletion of the building—being a subscription of not less than £l, and
the perpetual one for the trusteeship membership of the church—the
member “frequenting its public services and not being known publicly
to impugn any of its doctrines.” A trustee absent from the colony for
six months continuously, or becoming insolvent, or “ disqualified as herein- ■>
before mentioned” —I presume by cessation of membership or by im-
pugning the doctrines of the church —was to be removed by the remaining
trustees, and the vacancy was then to be filled up in like manner as in the
first nomination or election—supposing the church or chapel to be still
incomplete. If it were finished the elective right was vested in the pew-
holders, renters, and annual contributors, being members of the church ;
one-sixth of the sittings in any church or chapel being reserved as free.
The pewholders and renters were to have as many votes, not exceeding
six, as they held or rented seats, the contributors one vote for every pound
sterling subscribed. The same constituency was to elect the church-
wardens at the annual Easter meeting. Power was reserved to the
“ Bishop of Australia ” to be the sole trustee of any church property and,
in the event of non-election, to nominate churchwardens ; and directions
were laid down for the regulation of elections, for the keeping and
auditing of trustees and churchwardens’ accounts ; for provision for the
maintenance of buildings, and “ for the due and orderly celebration of
public worship and the administration of the sacraments” in accordance
with the ceremonial and discipline agreed to in the Synod of London of
.1603, as well as for sundry minor matters with which it is unnecessary
to trouble the reader. When any glebe became likely to yield more than
£l5O per annum the trustees were empowered to lease it for any term
not exceeding twenty-eight years, and to apply the proceeds —after secur-
ing the incumbent £l5O per annum—for purposes of church extension
generally. By the subsequent Act of 1857 the maximum term was very
injudiciously lengthened to ninety years—a most absurd provision in a
colony in which not infrequently a quarter of the period quadruples the
value of property, and one which has been almost fraudulently taken
advantage of to the damage of the Church but to great private emolument
in New South Wales. The same Act forbade the mortgaging or eneum-

bering the property of the Church, and the trustees were directed to
furnish annual accounts of receipt and expenditure to the bishop of the
diocese.
The value of legislation must be collected from its results, and to
those which followed that which I have described I shall have hereafter
to refer. But, despite the impediments thrown in his way by the Act of
1837, Bishop Broughton worked with energy, and, indeed, with no small
measure of success, insomuch that in a few years’ time he found himself
in a position to recommend a re-arrangement of his diocese, by which
two new bishoprics would be created ; and he offered, in order to facili-
tate this being done, to give up a fourth of his own salary towards their
support. Accordingly, in June 1817, his desire w r as fulfilled in the conse-
cration of Dr. Perry as Bishop of Melbourne, and of Dr. Tyrell as Bishop
of Newcastle —the latter including, with other of the northern portions of
New South 'Wales, the district of Moreton Bay. In fifteen years the
Anglican Church increased under Bishop Broughton’s administration from
an archdeacon with fifteen chaplains and three catechists to three bishops
with an archdeacon and sixty clergymen, and it was not always good
ground on which the sower went forth to sow.
Moreton Bay as an entirely outside district was for some years left very
much to itself, but when Captain Wickham came, in 1812, to take the civil
government, Bishop Broughton sent the Eev. John Gregor with him, who
found a scattered and not very sympathizing flock. He was bred origin-
ally in the Presbyterian Church, his secession from which exposed him to
much unmerited vituperation from Dr. Lang, who accused him of being
actuated by mercenary motives. If the work he came to satisfied him
the work he left must have been the very wretchedness of penury. He
at first held occasional services in the room formerly used as a chapel in
the old convict barracks, and subsequently in an abandoned prisoners’
workshop, which the Bishop leased at a shilling per annum for the pur-
pose. There being no residence, he took lodgings in the Moravian Mis-
sionary Station, not far from Brisbane, and thence started on many a
weary journey, in the performance of his duties, in the bush and at the
squatting stations formed at the time. His was a position of toil and
privation, not unmixed with personal danger, obscure and poorly paid,
and productive less of thanks than of disappointment and mortification.
After four years of continuous and harassing work, Mr. Gregor was
accidently drowned while bathing in a waterhole at the Moravian Station,
and news of the sad occurrence met Dr. Tyrrell on his arrival at Sydney,
on his way to take charge of his diocese—a diocese which, thenceforward,
he may be said never to have left, and which will ever remain indebted


to his powerful intellect, unwearied energy, and noble disinterestedness,
during an episcopate of thirty-two years. He at once sent the Rev. B.
Glennie —now Archdeacon Glennie—to take Mr. Gregor’s place. During
his residence in Brisbane, and in 1819, the Rev. I. Bodenham, then living
temporarily at what is now the suburb of Kangaroo Point, collected
money for the erection of the old wooden church in that locality, and it
was opened about September in the same year. From the ill-kept records
of St. John’s (the mother church of the diocese), .and from such other in-
formation as I have been able to collect, Mr. Glennie must have left for
the Darling Downs sometime in (?) July, 1850, the Rev. John Wallace
taking his place for Brisbane and Ipswich. This gentleman is recorded
to have presided at a meeting of the church in August of that year ; after
which time, I find no entry until November 8, 1851; but, from other
sources, I gather that the Rev. H. 0. Irwin took charge of Brisbane in
1851 or 1852 ; Mr. Wallace being transferred to Ipswich, where a tem-
porary wooden building had been, or was about to be, built. At what
date Mr. Irwin’s connection with the parish ceased, I am unable to find;
but in an entry of a meeting on February 7, 1856, the name of the Rev.
Yeatman occurs ; and he appeal’s to have continued at St, John’s until
September, 1858, when he left the district. Mr. Wallace had preceded
him in December, 1851, and was succeeded by the late Rev. John Moseley,
who, throwing his whole soul into his parochial work, was the principal
instrument in procuring the erection of the large, though not very eccle-
siastical looking, church of St. Raul’s in Ipswich. On Mr. Yeatman
leaving, Mr. Moseley was transferred to Brisbane, being succeeded in
Ipswich by the Rev. L. H. Rumscy ; and at the date at which this portion
of this history terminates, the services of the three clergymen seem to
have been thus distributed :—Mr. Mosoly had charge of the Brisbane dis-
trict, in which was included, besides the duties at St. John’s, occasional
services in the buildings which accommodated both congregations and
scholars in Fortitude Valley, South Brisbane,* and, I presume, when he
could find time, at Kangaroo Point as well; Mr. Rurasey attended to St.
Paul’s, Ipswich, and the districts around that town ; while Mr. Glennie
travelled over the Darling Downs, his district including Drayton and
Toowoomba, Dalby, Leyburn, and Warwick —an area of at least 8,000
square miles. This memoir would be exceedingly imperfect were I not
to record my admiration of the unostentatious unceasing labours of Mr.
Glennie, who, colporteur, schoolmaster, and priest, walked and rode, with
pack well stored with the books he thought most likely to be useful, many

thousands of miles in the course of his long, unassisted, and solitary mini-
strations over that large extent of territory, labouring alike for the pre-
sent and the future, and, on his retirement, carrying with him the-
affectionate respect of those most familiar with his self-denying unselfish
toil, and his kindly simple advocacy of the cause he loved so well. It is-
proper also to mention the aid frequently given, in Brisbane and its
vicinity, by the Rev. R. Creyke, at the time too invalided to take a regular-
cure —but now incumbent of the suburban parish of Toowong.
I do not, in the slightest degree, infer any want of earnestness or
ability in the clergymen who successively attempted to minister to the
congregations of the Anglican Church during the period over which I
have gone, when I admit that the result of their labours in the Moreton
Bay district appears to have been far from successful. The imperfect
nature of the Church Acts greatly contributed to cripple their efforts. In
prescribing the voting qualifications, those acts exhibit a temporizing
timidity, significant of changing and uncertain times, of which indiffer-
ence was a prominent characteristic. Whoa they supplied no readily
available corrective for any breach of their own provisions, or of the-
internal laws of the body to which they were intended to apply, their
inevitable tendency to subordinate the collective church to the individual
congregation became exceedingly mischievous. Their framer had, no-
doubt, to some extent, the disciplinary powers of the mother church im-
pressed upon his mind, but he did not give due weight to the altered
circumstances around him, which, in great measure, neutralised their
operation ; neither did he attempt to supply the deficiency thus created,
and it is quite possible that the excellent prelate, who seems to have-
exerted himself in procuring this legislation, was unacquainted with the
technicalities which were necessary to carry his intentions fully into-
effect. It is easy to see what the real purpose of these acts was ; it is
equally apparent that the machinery provided was inadequate to the-
proposed end.
But whatever might have been the imperfections of the law, the-
obedience rendered to it in. the Moreton Bay district was intermittent and
desultory. The notions generally entertained as to what the real
doctrines or discipline of the Anglican Church might be were exceedingly
vague, while the intense localism incidental to small communities had
generated a spirit adverse to its constitution. Its members became im-
pressed with a sense of responsibility which sometimes exhibited itself in
rather eccentric directions. For all practical purposes the canons of 1603
might as well have been the Institutes of Justinian, and had any priest of
the church attempted in 1859 to impose the thirtieth upon his congrega


tion, they would have stopped their ears with their fingers and fled. But
too often in the zeal to discuss theology, plain, administrative duties were
forgotten, and the haste to criticise was more apparent than the critical
faculty or the knowledge essential to its beneficial employment. The
minister became less a teacher than a candidate for approval, and church-
wardens and trustees forgot their minute-books and their accounts to rush
into controversy over offertories and responses with their Bishop. The
records directed to be kept by the Church Acts were scandalously
neglected, even in churches -of metropolitan pretensions. In one case I
found a period of four years without a minute ; in another a period of
two, while not a vestige of account was discoverable amongst the records
of the church, and the visitations of the Bishop were not only left without
specific notice, but were not even alluded to. Whatever any minister
might have attempted, it appears to me that, as to the other officers of the
church, “ there being no king in Israel, every man did that which was
right in his own eyes,” the natural result being that in most cases every
man thought all other men more or less in the wrong.
To a church thus disorganized was appointed, as the first Anglican
Bishop in Queensland, the Eight Eevercnd Edward Wyndham Tuffnell, of
Wallham College, Oxon, a man of old family and considerable attain-
ments, and a Prebendary of Salisbury. He came to exchange for a life of
learned leisure and dignified association, under the shadow and amidst
the eloquent, though silent, grandeur of one of England’s most magnifi-
cent cathedrals, an existence embittered by a covert hostility, exhibited
in little suspicions and insulting insinuation. I have said in Queensland,
because the boundaries of the colony and of Dr. Tuffnell’s diocese were
not co-terminous. At the creation of the diocese of Newcastle its
northern limit was found at the 21st parallel of latitude, the western at
141° E. longitude; the letters patent creating the new diocese limited
it to such portions of that of Newcastle as was comprised within the
boundaries of the new colony, and hence it followed that all of Queens-
land beyond the old diocese was left under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction
of the Bishop of Sydney—an arrangement subsequently productive of
great inconvenience. However, for this there was no remedy, and under
the circumstances I have described the Anglican Church awaited its
reorganization and its head.
I regret that I could not obtain the information necessary to enable
me to give as detailed an account of the establishment of the Eoman
Catholic Church in Moreton Bay as I desired. I gather from the Courier
that in 1840 one priest had been sent here whose name does not appear,
but that he was a man of considerable energy I should infer from the


commencement of a chapel in 1818. The ministrations of whatever
clergy were here seem to have been uneventful, and the peace of the
church, undisturbed by internal dissension, although the spirit of localism
was said to have been stronger than in later days, was thought consistent
with ecclesiastical discipline. The late Archbishop Folding visited the
district in September, 1858, but the journals of the day make no special
mention of the causes or results of his visitation ; in fact, I do not think
that Roman Catholicism found much favor in the eyes of the newspapers
of those times. In 1859 there were two clergy here—the Very Reverend
Dean Rigny—one of a class now well nigh extinct, mingling with not a
little of the polish of the old French Abbe, a frank and kindly courtesy
that won the hearts of all who came in contact with him—was resident in
Brisbane. Father IFGinty, an active, energetic, warm-hearted priest, of
a different type, was devoting himself to his duties—not the least being
the erection of a chapel somewhat in advance of the ordinary taste of the
times—at Ipswich, and in the interior districts to the west of that town.
Both of them were popular, and from what I remember of the circum-
stances and the people, I should say, deservedly so. Their church was,
from its constitution, left unfettered by special legislation, but partook of
the advantages offered by the General Churches Act, and at the time of
separation were each left in receipt from the state of £l5O a year. In
view of the new colony a diocese of concurrent extent had been created,
to which the late Right Reverend James O’Quinn had been nominated
Bishop, of whom, as he did not arrive until some months after the new
Governmeilt began, I defer further mention.
The settlement of the Scottish Presbyterian Church iu Queensland
may be traced to three sources. In the parent colony of New South Wales
a variety of causes, detailed at some length in Dr. Lang’s history of New
South Wales, led to the existence at this time of three Synods: the Synod
of Australia, connected with the Established Church of Scotland ; the
Synod of Eastern Australia, erected by the Free Church party in the colony
in connection with that church in the old country; and the Synod of New
South Wales, called into existence by Dr. Lang, when he disavowed the
Established Church, and held himself aloof from, or was held at arms
length by, the church of the secession. It is unnecessary to detail the
disputes and troubles that perplexed those times, and did little credit to
the controversialists ; whoever has a taste for that peculiar sort of polemics
will find in the history I have alluded to a pungent enough description of
the whole—of course from the writer’s own point of view—which I do
not think it necessary to repeat or abridge.
The branch of the Established Church of Scotland in Australia was, as
regards all grants made to it from the State, placed under the operation


of the General Churches Act before referred to. But, subsequently to the
passing of that Act it was, as in the case of the Anglican Church, found
necessary to adopt special legislation adapted to its circumstances and
ecclesiastical peculiarities. By the 8 Wm. IV., No. 7, more detailed pro-
vision was made than had before been for the nomination of trustees of
property or moneys given to, or held for, the Church ; for defining the
manner in which the trusts created shall be fulfilled, and for otherwise
regulating the temporal affairs of churches, chapels, and ministers’ dwel-
lings over which the then Presbytery had or might have control. Without
repeating the technicalities of this Act —in many respects similar to
those of the Anglican Act before cited—l may note that the minister in
each case might be present and vote at the meeting of trustees ; that
land appertaining to any church or chapel might, under certain con-
ditions, be let on twenty-eight years’ leases, provided that £l5O a year
was reserved out of the income for the minister, and if he resided on the
land a portion not exceeding one-fifth of the area in addition ; and that
the powers and duties of the trustees were specifically confined to the
temporal matters connected with the church or chapel in connection with
which they were appointed. In 1810, when the Presbytery was converted
into the Synod of Australia, a further Act—the 4 Victoria, No. 18—was
passed, by which the powers before given to the Presbytery were trans-
ferred to the Synod, and practically all State aid to the Church made
contingent on conformity to the legislation then adopted. Under this
Synod the Kev. W. 1.. Nelson, 1).1).,* was, in 1859, minister of the Scottish
Church of St. Stephen’s, Ipswich, he having taken charge of the district
in 1853, and he received, I believe, £l5O per annum in aid of his stipend.
The Synod of Eastern Australia — i.e., the Free Church—was repre-
sented in 1859 by the Eev. C. Ogg, who officiated at the church in Ann-
street, of the date of whose settlement here I have no record, but who
still lives and labours amongst us.
The Synod of New South Wales had, in 1859, two representatives—one
Mr. J. Kingsford, who seems to have had a church and small congre-
gation at Warwick, and the other, a Mr. G. Wagner, who is described in
the statistics as an “itinerating” minister. The life of this sprout from
the Presbyterian stem seems to have been weakly, and its comprehen-
siveness far beyond its strength ; accordingly, in due time, it became
defunct.
Judging by the statistics of attendance the Scottish Presbyterian
Church seems to have retained its hold upon the people who came from

the land of its birth ; —principally of a class whom Dr. Tulloch would not
have been much in love with, although he might have admired their con-,
sistency even in the hatred of whistle kists and the preference of pre-
centors. On the doctrines taught I am neither qualified or called upon
to say more than that, at that time at least, the hearers appeared to rejoice
in an orthodoxy and hatred of Erastianism on one side, and of Roman
Catholicism and prelacy on the other, sufficient to meet the requirements
of the strictest presbytery of the old nursery of Galvanism. What some
might consider their narrowness in theology did not nevertheless prevent
their forming a very valuable section in the general community.
The Wesleyan Church showed its usual activity from the first in the
Moreton Bay district. So early as the year 1816 the Rev. Wm. Moore
was on a mission here, bat after a time was succeeded by the Rev.
Lightbody. In 1848 it was stated in the Australian Circuit Record that
a small chapel had been erected by Mr. George Little, on leasehold
ground in North Brisbane, and that three allotments had been granted as
sites for a chapel, a schoolroom, and a minister’s dwelling—l presume the
ground at the angle of Albert and Adelaide streets, Brisbane, on which
the principal chapel now stands. The official report for 1818-9 stated that
the attendance was good, that the building was always filled, and some-
times crowded, and that a Sunday-school of forty children had been
established. In 1850 the Rev. John Watsford was appointed to the
ministry in Moreton Bay; how,long he remained I know not, but I infer
that he had some assistance, since services w'erc held at Ipswich and at
the German Station, as well as at Brisbane. At this date all the
Wesleyan circuits were mission stations under the English Wesleyan
Foreign Missionary Society, but in 1855 the whole of the circuits in
Australasia, New Zealand, and the South Sea Islands were formed into a
Conference, affiliated to the British Conference. The return from Moreton
Bay to the new Conference showed that there were then three churches,
forty-two preaching places, and two Sunday-schools in the district, in
which five ministers and assistant ministers and ten teachers ministered to
six hundred hearers and one hundred and twenty scholars. I am unable
to give the names of their successors up to 1859, but at the end of that
year the Colonial Statistics enumerate three ministers :—the Rev. Samuel
Wilkinson, who preached at Albert-street church, and is recorded to have
“held service at seven other places the Rev. William Curnovv, whose
church was in Limestone-street, Ipswich ; and the Rev. Wm. Fallon, who
was stationed at Warwick. The number of persons generally attending
is set down at 675, but no mention is made of assistant ministers, Sunday-
schools, teachers, or scholars, nor am I sure that the statistics are to be
implicitly relied upon. It is however certain that the condition of the


■church was solid and prosperous, as the astonishing advances made during
the next five or six years assuredly showed.*
There is an old proverb that “ poverty makes men acquainted with
strange bedfellows,” and the circumstances attendant upon the early
settlement of the Baptists in Queensland, to some extent, illustrate it,
although it might seem that the co-operative spirit displayed in the first
instance was subsequently, at least for a time, lost sight of in what was
termed the genuineness of church membership. Be that as it may, the
series of events is too valuable as showing the spirit of the times to be
omitted from this record.
Before the arrival of the ship Fortitude, in 1849, there were only
two Baptists in Brisbane, but with that vessel came the Reverend Charles
Stewart—himself a Baptist minister, and about five other members of the
same denomination. These, with a like number of Independents and
Presbyterians, formed a small but united congregation, of which Mr.
Stewart became the pastor, who held their services in the old Court-house,
in Brisbane, whose varying transformations I have described, and the use
of which was granted by Captain Wickham for the purpose. The congre-
gation grew and prospered under Mr. Stewart’s care, and in time £ll3
was collected, with which a piece of land was bought fronting William-
street and running back to George-street, as a site for a chapel, and a
further sum of £6OO was then raised, which was applied to the erection on
part of the ground of the first and, as it proved, the last church of the
united congregation. With prudent foresight it was agreed that so soon
as either of the three denominations considered itself strong enough to, in
the words of my informant, “ set up upon its own account,” the church
property was to be sold and the proceeds equally divided. The services,
however, were still conducted by Mr. Stewart for three or four years,
when failing health compelled his retirement, and he returned to England
where he shortly afterwards died. After his departure the Baptists
thought that they had within themselves the elements of stability, and
the property was then sold to the late Dr. Lang for £1,500, out of which
they received their third share of £500.f
* For the most valuable portion of the information I have been able to record I am
indebted to the courtesy of the Rev. F. T. Brentnall, who took some trouble in preparing
the notes from which it has been compiled.
t That part of the ground on which the chapel was built was, with the chapel, sold
by Dr. Lang to the Queensland Government for £2OOO. The building was for some yean
used as a Telegraph Office, and then was converted into a residence for the Government
Printer, and so remains.


After this separation, the Baptists were granted the use of the oldest
police court, then held in the same old building, in which they had first
met, and afterwards converted into offices for the Crown Solicitor, the
Attorney-General occupying the look-up and keeper’s quarters, during
which time the Rev. Smith became the pastor; but, says my infor-
mant, “ from either a defect in the man himself, or a want of appreciation
on the part of the people, he remained only about a year.” After he left,
the church remained without a minister until the arrival of the Rev. B. G.
Wilson, 1858, who remained its head until his death—nearly twenty years
afterwards. During the first year of his ministry, the church in Wharf-
street, which had been commenced the year before, was completed at a
cost of about £2,300 ; and, in the statistics of the colony, I find the at-
tendance stated as at 200, besides which the denomination had a chapel
at the German Station, and a room at Ipswich ; accommodation hereafter
to expand with the prosperity of the colony, and in fair proportion to it.*
Into what haven the Presbyterian division of the thus separated con-
gregation drafted, I am not aware, but the building seems to have been
occasionally availed of for divine service, sometimes by the Lutheran
body (Germans), as I find the Rev. C. F. A. F. Schermeister described as
officiating in it to an attendance of forty, and sometimes in the tolerance
of Dr. Lang, by whomsoever being like-minded with himself required
its use.
The Independents formed a separate congregation, for some time
availing themselves of the old School of Arts, until the completion of the
then new church in Wharf-street, North Brisbane, and, in 1859, the
statistics register the name of the Reverend George Wight as the minister,
the attendance being stated as 150, Another entry informs us that the
Reverend J. J. Waraker was the pastor of a congregation of 100 at
Ipswich, the origin of which was in some respects akin to that of those I
have just described. Briefly, the incidents seem to have been these: Dp
to March, 1857, there was, outside the Anglican and Roman Catholic
Churches, no settled minister of any denomination in Ipswich; in that
month the Reverend Thomas Deacon, a Baptist minister, arrived there,
and shortly afterwards a temporary place of worship was fitted up, in
which service was carried on by him for two years, when a meeting was
held, at which it was resolved to form a “ Congregational Church which
should include the two denominations usually called the Baptist and In-
* I am obliged to my friend Mr. Win. Bell and to the Hon. dames Swan for the
greater portion of the information thus condensed—the authenticity of which, I prer
sume, will not be challenged.


dependent,” and to cement tlie union -‘that the subjects of infant and
adult baptism should not be introduced into the pulpit, nor should any
other means be employed for the purpose of making Baptists Indepen-
dents or Independents Baptists.” The compromise, unlike its prede-
cessor in Brisbane, was of short duration, for in about nine months both
resolutions were rescinded, for reasons which it is said “do not transpire
on the records of the Church.” Mr. Deacon resigned his pastorate,
receiving the thanks of his late congregation for ‘‘the excellent spirit he
had displayed,” and the Reverend E. Griffith, who had been sent for from
New South Wales, took his place ; but, after a brief pastorate of two years
and four months, left to take charge of the congregation at Maitland, in
that colony. Meanwhile, in 1855, a new chapel on which £IOO had been
expended, and which is now used as a school-room, was opened with
much rejoicing, and in this the Reverend Mr. Warakcr was officiating at
the creation of the colony. Nothing of moment arose after this, unless
the question whether the use of the harmonium was permissible in public
worship be deemed so. They to whom that instrument is a source of
pleasure will be gratified to learn that after due deliberation the doubtful
tendencies of instrumental music were provided against by a stipulation
that it should be employed “to assist and not to supersede the congrega-
tional psalmody,” and that the harmonium was thereupon admitted.
Nothing thereafter seems to have disturbed the harmony of the church,
which went on its useful works quietly prospering, yet not without
energy withal.
I have thus gone through the early history of the settlement of the
different churches prior to the creation of the colony—more in detail than
by some may be thought necessary ; but to those who appreciate the
glimpses of life and thought and character which it affords, surely not
without interest or use. We may easily see how the difficulty of organiza-
tion and of adherence to the distinct lines of creed and practice which
mark the separation between churches as bodies beget indifference to
both—to be succeeded in some cases by a violent reaction, in others by a
continued apathy to what had been so forgotten from long disuse that,
when recalled, it was looked upon less as a return than as an obtrusive
and dangerous narrative. I suspect that the leaven thus raised did in
some measure, and to a greater extent than many would imagine, leaven
the whole mass of religious and political working in the times that were
to come, and, if so, the retrospect will have its value.
To those who take the trouble to reflect on the circumstances pre-
sented by this history it will be clear that the surface agitation, which,
appeared to exert so marked an influence in bringing about the separation


from New South Wales, was without doubt inferior in reality to the loss evi-
dent undercurrent excited by self-interest and selfish fear. The rapid pro-
gress of those principles in laud legislation which first found embodiment in
the measures of Sir John Robertson (the “Free-seloction Jack” of the period)
alarmed the squatters—the leading and almost the sole producing class of
the little community—who conceived that their share in the resources of
the country was threatened, and that their tenure would be almost
extinguished by his bill. And accordingly, while the popular platform
was adopted in Morcton Bay as one of the most efficient instruments in
arriving at the desired end, a persistent worrying of the Colonial Office
was kept up in London by men who were not popular here, but there
were received as the exponents of the wealthiest and most influential
class of the community, and who, ostensibly fighting for that, found their
zeal intensified by the remembrance that they were especially fighting for
themselves. The almost invariable neglect of the district by the central
authorities was, without doubt, a special subject for invective, but dis-
similarity in general interest was an efficient cause of separation ; a fact
which should act as a warning to ourselves, although the local govern-
ment Acts of recent years have done much to remove the causes of that
discontent at partial and unfair expenditure, which was so deeply felt in
the district prior to 1860. Whenever differences in climate, or cultivation
in the industries which result from them, attain their natural develop-
ment the obstacles to general legislation which must naturally follow from
them will exert much the same sort of influence that similar ones did in
the times we are reviewing. Not even the telegraph itself can fully
counteract the laxity which distance permits to official administration
remote from the superior authority. We may, therefore, contemplate the
ultimate separation of the northern districts from the south more as a
sequence than as a calamity—as the necessary outcrop of natural causes ;
and so viewing it mayavert a bitterness which the severance of Queens-
land from New South Wales left behind it, to the damage and discredit
of both.
Great anticipations of vast and indefinite advantages to follow from
separation were, no doubt, indulged in—anticipations only just now
beginning to be realised. The right of self-government had been
obtained, but, beyond that, for many years afterwards, commerce ran in
the old channels, and the commercial dependanoe upon New South Wales
was steadily enforced and tacitly acquiesced in. With but a brief interval,
the greater part of the carrying trade of the colony was left in the hands
of a company in which our people had the slightest possible interest; and,
for a considerable period, up to the year 1880, the direct trade of the
oolony with Europe was steadily, and yet almost unobservedly, decaying.


In 1879, the import from New South Wales was nearly fifty per cent,
more than in 1877, although our numbers increased but slightly ; while
from Great Britain it had fallen rather more than twenty per cent, in the
same time, and was only a fifteenth of the whole. Administrative inde-
pendence may co-exist with commercial bondage, but they who pointed
this out were, for a long time, as voices crying in the wilderness; and
when, at last, the fact and its consequences were brought home to the
public appreciation, the conviction was received as an unwelcome guest.
It has taken a long time to emancipate public thought and action from
the old trammels, in spite of the influx of population, in itself not nearly
so great or so continuous as was both possible and desirable. Those who
came were unacquainted with the local circumstances, seldom concerned
themselves in our politics, such as they were, and soon became permeated
with the ideas of the older residents, possibly from deference to their pre-
sumedly greater experience—a term more abused than most terms in the
language. We may, in the words of the old Greek, grow old considering
many things, and yet have learned little —and the bulk of mankind don’t
consider. One thing the colony has been a long time discovering—the
value of self-dependence—the other, which it has yet to learn, is the
adjustment of ends to means.
In the early history of the district, the combination of patience and
skill was not often found, and, like that of the later period, it presents
us with abundance of beginnings on a large scale, and endings on a
small one ; of miscalculations of power ; of want of unanimity ; and of
that natural trust between classes and individuals which is necessary to
make a nation happy, and keep it so. Perhaps this was natural to the
paucity of numbers, agreement' in opinion being always fractional in the
body amongst whom it is formed ; and what ton men out of a thousand may
find impossible, 100 in 10,000 may easily carry out. But it is impossible to
glance over the period from 1812 to 1859 without feeling a thrill of
admiration at the persistent endurance with which the early settlers con-
fronted the difficulties of a varying fortune, consolidated their social'
strength against the introduction of a criminal, servile, and degraded
element, and rejected the independence they craved if it were to be
clogged by such a weight. That there should have been some narrowness
of mind, some local jealousies, and some class hostility was, under all the
circumstances, as natural as to ho regretted. But thus much may be
asserted in favor of the old colonists of Moreton Bay : when Sir George
Bowen came to assume the government of Queensland he found a com-
munity second to none in the British dominions in their unaffected hospi-
tality, in their natural propriety of conduct, in the support of their re-
ligious and educational institutions, and in their desire to see their adopted


country placed on the road to, what they believed ought to be, its position
in the great empire o£ which it formed a part. And if, with these quali-
ties, the defects arising from long repression and comparative isolation
and small numbers did display themselves, we may, while congratulating
ourselves upon a wider sphere and greater breadth of thought, sometimes
question whether both have not been gained by the sacrifice of the less
showy virtues of our predecessors, and unhappily in some cases to their
extinction.
