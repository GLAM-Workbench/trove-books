KALGOORLIE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA, TO PORT AUGUSTA,
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
COMMONWEALTH AND STATE RAILWAYS.
In addition to giving control of railways with respect to transport for naval
and military purposes, the Commonwealth Constitution Act 1900 empowers the Com-
monwealth to acquire any railways of a State with the State’s
consent, and to undertake railway construction and extension
in any State—likewise with the State’s consent. Under
Constitutional Provisions.
this latter power, it was determined to construct a railway to connect Kal-
goorlie, in Western Australia, with Port Augusta, in South Australia, thus bring-
ing the principal centres of Western Australia into railway communication with the
eastern States. It has long been felt that the isolation of the western State—Perth
being the only Australian capital unconnected with the other mainland capitals by rail
—was a national disadvantage.
The turning of the first sod of the railway on the 14th September, 1912, marked the
official commencement of the construction of the line. The ceremony was performed
by His Excellency the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Right
Honourable Thomas, Baron Denman, P.C., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.0., in the presence of a
large gathering of representative public men.
RAILWAY SYSTEMS OF AUSTRALIA.
The beginningof railway construction in Australia was marked by the turning of
the first sod of the 16-mile railway between Sydney and Parramatta, on the 3rd July,
1850. The line was opened for traffic on the 26th September, 1855. On the 31st
December, 1911, the position of the Government Railway Systems of Australia was

Two proposals for transcontinental lines have been under consideration for some
years.. One has found fulfilment in the commencement of the Port Augusta to Kal-
goorlie line. Another is to make an extension of the main

LINKING EAST AND WEST.
The South Australian railway system extends in a north-westerly direction as
far as Port Augusta, and the Western Australian system extends easterly to Kalgoor-
lie. Between these towns there is a stretch of over 1000
miles. Upon their connection it will be possible to travel by
rail through each of the mainland States’ capitals, from Ger-

miles in length, and the estimated cost of construction and equipment on a basis of a
4ft. in. gauge is £3,988,000.

Persons making the home journey from the eastern States can now only travel
overland as far as Adelaide, where they must embark. The European mails are also
shipped at the South Australian capital. On the return journey,
Advantages accruing. passengers and mails must remain on shipboard till they reach
Adelaide. Thus the line will be of immense benefit in expedit-
ing the European mails to and from the southern and eastern parts of the continent,
and in shortening the time of travel of people proceeding to or coming from Europe.
The net saving, represented by the difference of time between the rail and boat journey
from Adelaide to Fremantle, where the mails will be embarked or disembarked, is
days.
One of the great advantages of the railway will be the possibility of transporting
troops and army impedimenta. Hitherto, Western Australia would have had, in the
event of war, to depend for her defence on her own local troops, or, at any rate, suffer
the grave consequences that might possibly result from having to await the arrival of
additional troops by water. In addition to increasing the opportunities for intercourse
between the western and eastern States, the line will furnish quick transport for perish-
able goods, etc., and will tap the resources of a stretch of country having great pro-
ductive possibilities.
The line will be laid in a main east and west direction, roughly parallel to the coast
line. The route via Tarcoola was, for several reasons, chosen in preference to that via

the surveyors, that, while portion of the country which the

is an area of good country, extending to about 90,000 square miles, which can he con-
sidered favourable for pastoral development.
The chosen route presents no great engineering difficulties.
HISTORY OF THE MOVEMENT.
The construction of the line was urged for many years before its authorisation by
Parliament. At the time of the commencement of the northern railway from Port
Augusta, in 1878, the desirability of also constructing west-

velopment of the goldfields settlements, and their connection
by rail with Perth, the demand for the line increased. The tardy entrance of
Western Australia into the Federation was in part due to uncertainty regarding the
construction of the line.
Sir John Forrest, in his Federal campaign, informed the electors that, from his
knowledge of the views of statesmen in the eastern States, he was able to guarantee that
the early construction of the line would be undertaken.
Trans-Australian Railway,


At the inauguration of the Commonwealth Parliament in Melbourne in 1901, the
following clause formed part of the Governor-General’s Speech (vide Hansard, vol. 1,
p. 29)
“The question of the construction of a railway connect-
ing with these eastern communities the vast and hitherto
isolated State of Western Australia has been under con-

South and Western Australia are now in progress, together with other inquiries.
It is hoped that they may result in showing that the undertaking is justifiable.”
In the earliest debates, Western Australian members strongly advocated the con-
struction. The Commonwealth Government having undertaken the responsibility of
Federal defence, it was urged that it must also undertake what was essential to the
Trans-Australian Railway.


effective conduct of that defence, and this, it was claimed, included the construction
of the line. For more than a decade persistent advocacy has marked the speeches of
the Western members.
The Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Act 1907 appropriated £20,000
for the purpose of carrying cut the survey of the route. Earlv in 1908 the Chief
Engineers of the States met in conference, to recommend the
most advantageous method of procedure. In February, 1908,
Mr. H. Deane was appointed Consulting Engineer to the
Act of 1907 and Survey.
Commonwealth, and progress from that time has been mainly under his direction as
Engineer-in-Chief. The survey was completed in March, 1909.
The route is given in detail in a Schedule to the Act of 1911, and will be found on
pp. 19 and 20 hereinafter. For the first 70 miles the railway traverses the main auriferous
greenstone belt in which the goldfield of Kalgoorlie is situated.
From this point onwards for about 100 miles the country is
granitic, mostly covered with alluvial gravel and loam. The

soil over a large area through which the line passes is good, being covered with vegeta-
tion consisting of various salt bushes, blue bush, and grasses suitable for fodder. There
are also patches of mulga, black oak, myall, mallee, and myoporum, with frequent
thickets of sandalwood and quandong. The rainfall is light, averaging about 7or 8
inches per annum. There is evidence, moreover, of the existence of artesian and sub-
artesian water, and the question of putting down a series of test bores is under con-
sideration. For 900 miles of the route and for a width of at least 100 miles (50 miles
on each side of the line) there is good pastoral country. On this area it should be
possible.to depasture millions of sheep. It is reported that gold has been lately
struck at Tarcoola at a depth of 40ft., and that a crushing of 33 tons of ore yielded
8 oz. to the ton. The line will be 1,063 miles long, the steepest gradient lin 80. The
highest point is reached at a distance of about 103 miles from Kalgoorlie, where the
elevation is 1,354 ft. The gauge is 4ft. Sf^in.
A proposed deviation from the original route leading from Kalgoorlie was in-
spected by the Commonwealth Engineer-in-chief, and approved by the Minister. This
will have the effect of cutting out Bulong, while incidentally shortening the mileage
to some extent.
In New South Wales the prevailing gauge is 4ft. SjA'm., the whole of the Govern-
ment railways, except a small stretch of 40 miles, being of that gauge. Victoria has
a sft. 3in. gauge throughout, except in only four sections,
aggregating 121 miles. The whole of the Queensland rail-
ways are built with a 3ft. 6in. gauge. In South Australia the

gauge of the main line and 'branches is sft. 3m. —other lines generally are 3ft. 6in. All the
Western Australian railways are of a 3ft. 6in. gauge. Unification of gauge would mean
the adoption of a sft. 3m. or a 4ft. B}4in. standard. The cost of transforming the ex-

isting 4ft. gauge to the sft. jin. would cost £5,000,000. There is thus a
difference of £3,000,000 in cost in favour of the narrow gauge. After friendly com-
munications had passed between the Federal and States Governments, the Federal
Parliament decided upon a 4ft. gauge for the Transcontinental Railway.
THE KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY ACT 1911.
On the 20th September, 1911, the Flouse being in Committee, the Minister for
Home Affairs (The Hon. King O’Malley) moved:—‘‘That it is expedient that an appro-
priation of revenue and moneys be made for the purpose of a

appointment of officers, the making of charges, and the appropriation of moneys in con-
nection with such Railway.”
Some discussion ensued upon the motion, chiefly upon the question of determina-
tion of gauge. The question being resolved in the affirmative, the resolution was
reported and adopted.
MINISTERIAL SPEECHES.
On the motion for the second reading, the Minister for Home Affairs (The Hon.
King O’Malley) gave a brief history of the events which led up to its introduction.
The chief matters alluded to in the Minister’s speech were
as follow : —ln 1901, the Western Australian Government

from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta would probably be £4,400,000. Later reports
shewed that part of the country to be traversed was of good quality, and with an as-
sured water supply, would be admirably adapted for grazing purposes.
The Commonwealth then asked for a general report from the engineers of all
the States. These officers were asked to investigate the probable expenditure that
would be incurred in construction, the probable annual revenue
after construction, the cost of maintenance, the route recom-
mended, the gauge proposed, the probable time of construction,
Conference of Engineers.
the probable present and prospective effect of the railway, the advisability of its con-
struction, and any matters in connection with the scheme which the Commonwealth
considered should be brought under notice. The engineers endeavoured to make
themselves acquainted with local conditions, and three reports were received from the
conference in 1903, dated 12th March, 13th May, and 27th July respectively.
Early in 1908 a sum of £20,000 was voted by the Federal Parliament for a survey.
This latter was subsequently carried out, and on nth October, 1909, the engineers re-
ported the completion of the survey, which showed that a good
line of railway could be laid down with a 4ft. gauge, a
ruling gradient of 1 in 80, and a minimum curvature of

20 chains radius. The line would have a length of 1,063 miles, of which 462 miles
would be in Western Australia, and 601 miles in South Australia. The estimated cost,
£3,988,000, would include provision for water supply and rolling stock sufficient for
one passenger train per day, and one goods train in each direction every second day.
Regarding the cost, the Western Australian Government’s estimate was
£4,400,000. The first estimate of the conference of Engineers was £5,000,000, their
second estimate, £4,559,000. In the first year after the
opening of the line it was estimated that the revenue would
be £205,860 per annum; the working expenses, £114,400; in-

of £68,106 during the first year. But this deficit would be gradually reduced during

the first ten years. The report indicated that if Western Australia continued to pro-
gress in the same ratio during the first ten years after the line was constructed the esti-
mated revenue would be £411,720; the working expenses, £210,000; interest on the
original capital, plus 15 per cent, for improvements, at percent., £ 183,501; a total
of £393,501. The net profit over working expenses would thus be £18,219. The latest
estimate of cost was £3,998,000 for a 4ft. in. gauge railway.
The Minister further pointed out that Western Australia had promised to build
a railway between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle of the same gauge as the Transcontinental
line, and had in addition promised to defray for 10 years any
loss attributable to the Western Australian portion of that
line, while he also alluded to the circumstance that a govern-

ing factor in inducing the western State to enter the Union was the sure belief that
the line would be constructed in the early stages of federation.
The Minister also shewed how the railway would increase postal facilities, would
ensure a far quicker delivery of oversea mails into the various States’ capitals, and
would reduce the cost of maintaining the transcontinental tele-
graph line. At present there were no means of conveying
materials for the repair of the line except camel or mule

teams. When this railway was constructed, it would be possible —as was the case of
the railway between Burnie and Zeehan—for the same staff which maintains the road
to maintain the telegraph line, and so materially reduce the cost.
He also touched on the advantages of the railway from the point of view of de-
fence. He shewed also that residents of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie —large centres of
population and many others would settle in those districts,
would provide traffic, receiving South Australian stock and
products, and that enormous tracts of fertile country would

be opened up. It was pointed out also that the line would provide means for the rapid
removal of stock when necessary on account of drought, and thus prevent heavy losses.
The latest estimate of the cost of construction was given in the following detail: —

Possible reductions in the cost by the use of internal combustion engines and

Trans-Australian Railway.


In regard to the question of uniform gauge, the Minister shewed that if the
4ft. gauge were adopted, there would be no necessity to alter the embankments,
tunnels, bridges, and culverts in Victoria and South Australia, whereas, if the sft. 3m.
gauge were adopted, the tunnels, etc., would have to be widened and practically re-made
in New South Wales. There are about 300 more miles of sft. 3m. gauge than of 4ft.
B>din. gauge, but it was stated that the adoption of the latter gauge would mean a
difference of £3,000,000 in the cost of conversion.
Regarding the prospects of the line, the Minister remarked that the population
of Western Australia was about 300,000, having increased in the ten years by over
100,000 persons. In the same time, the number of horses
increased from 74,000 to 134,000; cattle from 400,000 to
800,000; sheep had doubled; consequently, the production of

wool had doubled since 1900, the State export having reached 26,000,000 lbs. in 1910.
But the greatest development had taken place in agriculture. The area under wheat
had increased from 94,000 acres to 581,482 acres in 1911. The area under oats had
increased from 9,751 acres to 61,918 acres, and the area under orchards from 6,076 acres
to 16,021 acres. The total area under crop had increased from 217,441 acres to
854,837 acres. The railway would carry some of that produce across the continent.
The late diminution in the gold production had little significance, since the industry
was still in its infancy. He shewed also how in the latest year for which records were
available the passengers to and from Western Australia numbered 55,000. As regards
the water supply on the line of route, the following figures were quoted: —At about
150-mile point, Ben Ben Well; at about 225-mile point, Rock
Hole, 2,750 gallons; at about 230-mile point, Rock Hole, 700
gallons; at about 235-mile point, Waddalynia, 1,100 gallons;

at about 1,016-mile point, Canegrass Flat Bore; at about 1,020-mile point, Kell’s Camp
Bore. It was pointed out that while in Western Australia there was very good
water all the way along the border, in South Australia the water was not so good.
In regard to postal facilities, the Minister pointed out that the mails from
London to Australia were carried by rail to Taranto, in the South of Italy; thence by
contract steamer to Adelaide; thence by rail to Melbourne,
Sydney, and Brisbane. The time occupied from London to
Taranto was about two days; from Taranto to Fremantle,

about twenty-two days six hours ; from Fremantle to Adelaide, about four days and
four hours; from Adelaide to Melbourne, about nineteen hours, and from Melbourne to
Trans-Australian Railway.


Sydney about nineteen hours. The transcontinental railway and the provision of postal
facilities were two of the biggest things in the history of Western Australia. A train leav-
ing Perth for Adelaide would be, to a Western Australian, tangible evidence of his parti-
cipation in the benefits of the great Commonwealth Federation, for he would realise that
he had some reason to be proud of his partnership in the Union. He would be brought very
rapidly into the bustle of Eastern life. Besides the gain in time, he would be saved the
discomfiture which often accompanied the sea voyage. The line would link, with bands
of steel and lightning-like express trains, the industrial, commercial, and financial supre-
macy of the East, and the pioneering, agricultural, and mineral progress of the Golden
West. It would open up millions of acres of soil unsurpassed in richness and beauty,
having a climate capable of nurturing a powerful, healthy, and generous people, and
worthy to be either the central pivot or a mighty outpost of Australian civilisation. But
a few years ago that spacious inland empire was open only to the blackfellow and his
lubra. He ventured to predict that before many years had rolled by, the country would
hold a very large population, larger than ever crowded within the gates of Athens, when
her fighting men, under Miltiades, won liberty for humanity on the field of Marathon;
larger than that of Sparta during her supremacy, when she sent forth her sons, quickened
by the encouragement of their mothers’ benediction to return with their shields, or on
them; larger, indeed, than that which crowded on the seven hills of Rome when, under
her mighty rulers, she commenced that sovereign sway that afterwards embraced the
whole world.
The Bill was freely discussed in subsequent sittings. (Vide Hansard, vol. LX.)

and development purposes. In the United States also, notwithstanding its vast water
supplies, duplicate tracks were laid down. There were three transcontinental lines in
Canada and another which w r as almost worthy of being called a fourth. Australia needed
more railways for developmental purposes than any other country. Comparison with the
vast railways of Canada, which had in addition the finest river system in the world, and a
chain of lakes which allowed navigation for thousands of miles, showed how far Aus-

tralia was lagging behind. He also stated that the work was one for the National Par-
liament, being too huge an undertaking for the comparatively small communities of
South and Western Australia, which were heavily burdened with the task of develop-
ing their own extensive territories.
Proceeding, the Minister stated that few railways in Australia had been so much
discussed, so much inquired into, so much thought over. All the advantages and

disadvantages, all the benefit, all the evil, that could flow from the construction of the
line, were thoroughly well known, and had been thoroughly well canvassed and inves-
tigated.
He pointed out further that Western Australia would look to the Commonwealth
to make available for her defence the forces of the other districts, just as the whole Com-
monwealth had a right to expect that the forces of Western
Australia should be made available for the defence of the other
portions of the Commonwealth which might be threatened.
Defence.
Australia, having no land frontier, was subject to attacks from the sea. It was,
therefore, necessary to be in a position to direct troops to any point that might
be threatened from the sea. With the advent of wireless telegraphy, and with
the increased speed of steamships, threatened attacks would be preceded by a
longer warning than heretofore. One of the proposals agreed upon at the re-
cent Imperial Conference related to the extension by means of a chain of
stations lying to the north and north-west of wireless telegraphy throughout the
Pacific. The movements of foreign warships would then be communicated, and it
would be known for which point they were making. It was very essential that by
means of internal railways we should be able to concentrate wherever an attack
threatened to prevent a landing. It was suggested that the line opposite Eucla was
too near the coast, and that an enemy might cut the connection, though that objection
had not emanated from the Defence authorities. The actual distance was 60 miles,
through inhospitable country. That represented the nearest approach of the line to the
coast. It would take a boat’s crew three days to reach the line, and it was doubtful
if there was the slightest danger of attack being made in the neighbourhood of Eucla.
The character of the coast did not permit of ships lying close in in all weathers. Heavy
weather would necessitate their heading right out into the Bight for safety, thus com-
pletely cutting off any boat’s crew which might have landed. The line formed a link
between the populated portions of South and Western Australia, and if it were taken
further from the coast, the detour that would be necessary would add immensely to
the cost of construction and maintenance. Lord Kitchener had said, at the conclusion
of his tour round Australia, during the whole of which his mind had been concentrated
on the problems of defence, that the present isolation of the western State must be not
only a great commercial and political disadvantage, but also might at any time be-
come a serious source of military weakness; that one of the greatest needs of Australia
was systematic, statesmanlike, and comprehensive railway extension; that trunk lines
opening up communication and developing the fertile districts in the interior would
undoubtedly stimulate the growth of population, as well as foster trade, and consider-
ably increase the means of defence. Lord Kitchener’s remarks mapped out a splendid
national policy. Senator Pearce also referred at some length and in illuminative
detail to the character of the country its water supply, the possibility of using internal
combustion engines on the line, estimated revenue and expenditure, and the question of
gauge, etc.

In the course of the debate an amendment was moved to the effect that the Bill

The Act provides for the construction of the line being undertaken upon the Wes-
tern Australian Parliament giving its consent to the construction of the Western Aus-
tralian portion of the line, and upon the Parliaments of South
Australia and Western Australia agreeing to grant such por-
tions of their Crown lands as may be required for the purposes

of the railway. The route is laid down in a schedule as follows:
Commencing’ at Kalgoorlie, the line follows the existing railway to Kanowna for a
little over 6 miles, thence bearing generally south-easterly to the township of Bulong;
thence for about 17 miles in the same general direction, being situated near the Wes-
tralia Timber Company’s tramway; thence running almost due east adjacent to the 31st
parallel of latitude for about 357 miles; thence on a bearing north 79 degrees east until
the South Australian border is reached at about 461 miles 77 chains 89 links from centre
of Kalgoorlie station platform; thence in the State of South Australia the line runs in
the direction 10 degrees north of east, cutting Cornish’s line in latitude 30 degrees 28
minutes, and striking the sandhill country 170 miles east from the Border and miles
south from Ooldea Well; thence through the sandhills for 108 miles in a general easterly
direction, passing about quarter of a mile south of Wynbring Rock; thence in a direct
course to the north side of Kychering Hills, and continuing in a straight line to the
western boundary of the Wilgena Station, which is crossed at a point miles north of
Finding Rockhole; thence in an easterly direction to Tarcoola. From Tarcoola the line
runs easterly to near Wilgena Hill, continuing in a south-easterly direction, and passing
about 1 mile north of the Wilgena head station; thence running easterly, skirting the
south-west end of Lake Moolkra and passing along the north side of the hill near Earea
Dam, to about 885 miles from Kalgoorlie, mile south of Coondambo head station,
thence passing immediately south of Lake Hart; thence to a crossing of Eucolo Creek
at about miles from Kalgoorlie; thence ascending and following the open table-
land to a point opposite Lake Windabout, where it descends and crosses that lake at
about 969 miles, continuing in a generally south-eastern direction past Oakden Hills
head station at Bellamy’s Well, passing Gibson’s Camp at 1,007 miles, No. 1 Tank at
miles, and leaving the main north-west track from Fort Augusta near the 14-mile
dam, contouring the southern slope of the high ground on the west side of Spencer’s Gulf,
crossing the head of the Gulf at Yorkey’s Crossing at about 1,055 miles, and thence pass-
ing along the eastern shores of Spencer’s Gulf, reaching the township of Port Augusta at
about 1,059 miles 73 chains, thence proceeding to a point near the intersection of Tassie-
street and Thompson-street, thence crossing Mackay-street, Jervois-street, Langford-
street, and Flinders-terrace, crossing the west corner of the'old cemetery, and entering

A branch line to Port Augusta wharves leaves the main line to the right between
Caroline-street and Tassie-street at about 1,061 miles i chain from Kalgoorlie, joining
the existing wharf lines.
As stated previously, the gauge is 4ft. 8y 2 m. The provision of all things necessary
or convenient for efficient construction and working is authorised, including engines
worked by steam or other mechanical power, and the rolling-stock of any State Railway
may run upon the line. Necessary works, such as stations, buildings, bridges, culverts,
etc., may be erected. Special powers are vested in the Minister, equivalent to that of
States’ Railway Ministers in South and Western Australia. The making, adoption, and
enforcement of bye-laws are authorised, and power is given to connect with State railways.
Any part of the railway may be used for the carriage of passengers and goods before the
line has been declared open for traffic, but the Government incurs no responsibility for
injury or damage. Fares and rates for carriage of passengers and goods may be fixed,
and are subject to approval by Parliament. Officers may be appointed and employed.
Moneys received are to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Private lands may
be acquired under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906, the value assessed
being that of the lands on 19th September, 1911. Payments for construction are to be
made out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or out of moneys at credit of the Loan
Fund, according to appropriations made by Parliament for that purpose.

FURTHER LEGISLATION.
The Transcontinental Railway Land Grant Act 1911 of the South Australian Par-
liament authorised the grant to the Commonwealth of the lands necessary for the con-
struction of the line, provided that any lands granted without
consideration should not exceed one-eighth of a mile in width
on either side of the line, and should not include any town lands.
. States Authorising Acts.
The Transcontinental Railway Act 1911 of the Western Australian Government
authorised the construction of the railway by the Commonwealth, and provided for the
grant of such waste Crown lands in the State as were required for its construction, main-
tenance, and working.
An Act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in the session of 1912 (No. 3
of 1912) provides that any lands being public parks, recreation grounds, roads or lands
which have been reserved for any purpose, public or other,
whether by a State or by a private person, may be ac-
quired by the Commonwealth for the purposes of the railway

under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906. The immediate object was
to enable the Government to utilise about 26 acres of park lands at Port Augusta in

order that the railway station might be brought into the town, to which the South
Australian Government had consented. Further, the South Australian railway station
might be utilised, and the Commonwealth service harmonised with that of the State.

CONSTRUCTION BEGUN AT PORT AUGUSTA.
Parliament having authorised the Minister for Home Affairs to construct the line,
an immediate beginning was made. A Railways Construction Branch of the Depart-
ment was instituted. A staff was appointed, the following
being the chief officers: —Engineer-in-Chief, H. Deane, M.A:,
M.lnst. C.E.; Deputy Engineer-in-Chief, G. A. Hobler; Super-
Construction Branch Staff.

line. Construction will proceed rapidly, track-laying machines and other labour-saving
devices being employed. The builders will lead a nomadic life, moving their camp fur-
ther and further on into the unknown lands as piece by piece the railway is built. A
feature is to be made of the sanitation of the camps and the general comfort of the line-
builders. Supply of provisions will be directly by the Government, or under Governmen-
tal supervision. The materials used will be as far as possible of Australian production.
Powellised Karri sleepers will largely be used, and Bolb. rails. The rolling stock pro-

vided will be up to date in every respect, and will ensure the comfort of travellers. The
type of engine has not yet been determined. Consideration is being given to locomo-
tives constructed on the internal combustion principle. Until this matter is decided,
steam locomotives will be used.
Provision will be made for high speeds, reducing the time on the journey to a
minimum.
At Port Augusta, the South Australian terminus, a settlement was made as far
back as 1852. The present population is about 2000.
Representative citizens from all over the Commonwealth were invited to be
present at the commencement of the construction. The Governor-General, members of
the Ministries and of Parliaments of the Commonwealth and
Eastern States, and Heads of Departments, left Melbourne on
12th September, 1911, arriving at Adelaide the following day,

and continuing the journey to Port Augusta, which was reached on the morning of the
14th. The Australian torpedo destroyer flotilla (“Warrego,” “Parramatta,” and “Yarra”)
steamed into the port on the evening of the 13th. Comment was made upon the fact that
no member of the Western Australian Ministry was able to he present, thus adding
another argument in favour of the line. The invited guests who were present were: —

On the 14th September, 1912, Port Augusta was adorned with flags of all descrip-
tions, and streamers of many colours floated from many buildings. Work was suspended,
and there was everywhere an air of gaiety and festivity.
Crowds lined the streets and blockaded the thoroughfares
when the special trains conveying the Federal and State
Port Augusta en fete.
official parties arrived—many of them from a 1,500 mile train journey. At noon
the historic ceremony was performed. At luncheon and banquet, the optimistic tone of
the speeches and the progressive character of the proposals accorded with the bright-
ness and gaiety outside. At night illuminations blazed forth upon land and water. The
ceremonies over, at 11.30 p.m. the State train departed for Adelaide. The Commonwealth
party, most of whom bivouacked in tents in the Town Hall grounds, left the following
morning for Melbourne. It was after midnight before the crowds finally dispersed.

TURNING THE FIRST SOD.
HE scene of the ceremony was Cathedral Hill, and there shortly before noon
a crowd of many hundreds of people assembled. On a specially-erected plat-
form were the Commonwealth Ministers, Hon. King O’Malley
(Home Affairs), and Senator Pearce (Defence); the South
Australian Ministers, Hon, A. H. Peake (Premier), Hon. R.

Butler (Public Works), Hon. J. G. Bice (Chief Secretary), Hon. T. Pascoe (Agricul-
ture) ; also Sir Lancelot Stirling (President of the Legislative Council) ; Hon. L.
O’Loughlin (Speaker of the Legislative Assembly), Hon. J. Verran (Leader of thei
Opposition), and nearly a hundred other Federal and State members. At the foot of
the steps leading to the platform, ready to receive the Governor-General, were the
Governor of South Australia, His Excellency Sir Day Hort Bosanquet, Rt. Hon. A.
Fisher (Prime Minister), and Admiral Creswell. His Excellency the Governor-General
(Lord Denman), with a mounted escort, arrived at noon. As the Governor-General
passed through the lines, of the guard of honour the national anthem was played.
The Prime Minister said it was his pleasure to ask his Excellency to perform the
ceremony of turning the first sod of the transcontinental railway. . The people of
Western Australia, equally -with those of the eastern States,
were interested in the event, and there could be no greater
evidence of the necessity for the railway than the fact that
Interest in the Event.
Western Australia was unable to be represented at the function by any of its Ministers.
He was sure it was the desire of all that the people of the western State should be
brought nearer to those in the east, and that the aspirations and hopes that had
arisen out of federation should be fulfilled by the completion of the line. On behalf
of the Federal Government and the people of the Commonwealth, he asked his Excel-
lency to accept a memento of the occasion, and expressed the hope that Lord
Denman would remain long enough in Australia to drive the last spike into the rail-
way that would bring the people of the far north-east into closer communication with
those in the far north-west, and make the people on the mainland united in fact as
well as in name. He would now ask His Excellency to perform the very important
function, and express the wish that it might be successful.
27


The Prime Minister handed to His Excellency a miniature navvy’s shovel —
a replica of the implement which was to be used afterwards. Its blade, which
was of gold, bore the Commonwealth coat of arms and the
following inscription:—“Presented to His Excellency Right
Hon. Thomas Denman, P.C., G.C.M.G., Baron, Governor-
The Memento.
General of Australia, on the occasion of the turning of the first sod of the Kalgoorlie
to Port Augusta Railway at Port Augusta, September 14, 1912.”
The Governor-General said he could assure them he esteemed it a great honor, as
well as a great pleasure, that he should have been asked to come to Port Augusta,
and perform the ceremony of turning the first sod of the
transcontinental railway. The ceremony itself was a simple
one, but the occasion was most important, and had

rightly 'been termed historic, because it would find a place not only in the history of
Australia, but in that of the British Empire. An evidence of the importance of
this work to the Empire was the fact that he had that morning received
cables from His Majesty King George, and from the Imperial Government congratu-
lating the Government of Australia and the people of the Commonwealth upon

the event which was about to take place. The Prime Minister had said that the
ceremony had marked the beginning of the work of building a railway which would
link up the east with the west. But although it might be all that, it was also a
strategic work, because one of its objects was the defence of Australia, and it would
no doubt materially strengthen what was a weak point in regard to the protection of
the Commonwealth. While he hoped and believed it would contribute to the safety
of the country against invasion, he also hoped it would contribute towards the pros-
perity of two great Australian States in South Australia and Western Australia. It
would also bring about a community of interest, which scarcely existed at the present
time, between Western Australia and the southern and eastern States.
His Excellency said he hoped that the line would create a widespread spirit of
Australian nationality, and that it would increase the cordiality and scope of domestic
relations throughout the Commonwealth. Another great
point was that when the transcontinental railway was com-
pleted the existing system of mail transport would be greatly

facilitated, by reason of the fact that the time occupied in travelling between the
eastern and western States would be shortened three or four days, and the dis-
tance between the eastern States and the mother country would also be considerably
shortened. The hope had been expressed that he would take part in the ceremony at
the conclusion of the construction of the line, which would take place in a few years’
29


time. That hope he re-echoed, even though he recognised that one such function as
that he was participating in was quite enough to greatly feature the term of office
of any Governor-General. Before concluding his speech he wished to express his
sincere thanks for the beautiful gift made to him by the people of the Common-
wealth. There was no possession of his which he would value so highly. He was
glad to hear that it was all of Australian materials, and that it had been manufactured
in Melbourne, and would value it not only as a memento of a historic occasion, but

because he had received it from the hands of the Prime Minister of the great Com-
monwealth of Australia, and through him from the people of Australia.
THE HISTORIC ACT.
The Minister for Home Affairs (the Hon. King O’Malley) handed to Lord Den-
man a full-sized shovel with a nickel blade. His Majesty’s representative thrust the spade
into the ground, and turned the spadeful of earth into the barrow standing alongside.
30


There was history attached to this barrow, because it was the one used by Sir William
Jervois when he turned the 'first sod of the railway from Port Augusta to Govern-
ment Gums —the first section of the Great Northern line. It bore the inscription:—
“This barrow was used in the turning of the first sod of the Port Augusta-Govern-
ment Gums Railway, at Port Augusta, by Sir W. F. D. Jervois, Governor, January
18, 1878.” At a word from the Hon. King O’Malley, and to the accompaniment of music
from the band and the cheering of the assembled people, Lord Denman pushed the bar-
row along a plank for about 15 yards, and returned it to the starting point. The work
had been started on its long three years’ journey. The manual portion of the his-
toric day was over, and the proceedings concluded with cheers for the Governor-
General, given at the call of the Hon. King O'Malley, and for the railway.
The picturesque ceremony lasted about 20 minutes. A rocket was fired, and
after its explosion a thousand feet overhead was to be seen a small para-
chute gracefully opening and unfolding the flag of Australia, which, as a happy augury,
floated gaily over the gathered people. This was followed by a second, displaying
the Union Jack, and still another disclosing the star-spangled banner—surely an aus-
picious omen for a great undertaking.

THE LUNCHEON.
About 250 guests were present at the luncheon in the Port Augusta Town Hall,
but, as the Prime Minister remarked, at a later stage, there would have been many
more visitors to do honour to the occasion, but the difficulties of transport limited the
number. The hall and tables were artistically decorated.
The Prime Minister (Right Hon. A. Fisher) presided, and was supported on his
right by His Excellency the Governor-General and on his left by His Excellency the
State Governor. There were also present the Vice-President of the Executive Coun-
cil (Senator McGregor), the Minister of Home Affairs (Hon. King O’Malley), the
Minister of Defence (Senator Pearce), the Honorary Minister (Senator Findley), the

SPEECHES AT THE LUNCHEON.
The Prime Minister gave the toast of “ The King.” Usually that toast, he said,
was passed without comment; but on that occasion he must say how pleased they
would all feel at having received a cable message from His Majesty the King.
The Prime Minister, in submitting the health of His Excellency the Governor-
General, said they would all agree with him, after the evidence they had had that
day, that Lord Denman would prove an excellent man in another capacity of work

in the world. At all events, they felt that if any work was. well done that performed b>
the Governor-General that day was. And they were with His Excellency in the senti-
ment that the ceremony that day was only the beginning of a great railway, which would
in the near future bring the people of the Commonwealth closer together.
THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL.
The Governor-General said that before he ventured upon his reply he
desired to read to them a message which he had that day received from
His Majesty the King - . It was as follows: —“I desire
on the occasion of the turning of the first sod of
the Transcontinental Railway to express my keen sense

of the importance of this great national enterprise to my people in the Commonwealth,
and my best wishes for its complete success.” To that message which His Majesty
was good enough to send to them he had sent the following reply:—“The Govern-
ment and people of the Commonwealth have received with the greatest pleasure your
Majesty’s gracious message on the occasion of the turning of the first sod of the Trans-
continental Railway. They welcome this evidence of your Majesty’s ever watch-
ful care of the interests of all your subjects in every part of the world.”
He had also received the following cablegram from the Secretary of State for the
Colonies: —“Please convey to the Government and people of the Commonwealth the

most sincere congratulations of His Majesty’s Government, and the people of the
United Kingdom, upon the commencement of the Transcontinental Railway. This
great undertaking will, they are convinced, redound to the strategic and commercial
advantage of Australia. —(Signed), Harcourt.” To that he had replied as follows:—“I

thank you heartily for the message of congratulation from His Majesty’s Government
and the people of the United Kingdom. The Government and people of the Common-
wealth have received it with much pleasure.” Another telegram he had received was
from the Governor of Western Australia, as follows: —“Please allow me to offer most
hearty congratulations on the inauguration by your Excellency of the great national
railway connecting this State with the rest of Australia.” He had replied to the tele-
gram as follows: —“I thank your Excellency for your message of congratulation, and I
welcome the closer connection now in prospect between Western Australia and her
sister States.”
The messages which he had just read to them were, he thought, evidence of the
importance of that great occasion, not only to Australia, but to the United Kingdom
and other parts of the British Empire. For his own ptrt he
thought the inauguration of a railway like that which had
been projected across the unknown and undeveloped country

The minimising of distances and the peopling of the empty spaces of that continent,
was surely a work worthy of the statesmanship and of the Parliament of Aus-
tralia. He would like to take that opportunity of offering his hearty congratula-
tions to the Government and Parliament of the Commonwealth and the Parliaments

of the two States immediately concerned on the starting of the work. Apart from the
fact that a great undertaking had been begun that day, there was another especially
pleasing feature of the ceremony in which they had taken part that day, and at
was the presence of that great pioneer of exploration enterprise—Sir John Forrest.
It was, he believed, over 40 years since Sir John Forrest first crossed the
continent from Western Australia to South Australia. Sir John had been sur-
rounded by many difficult situations during his lifetime, but he had come through
them successfully; and he hoped that just as Sir John was the first to make the journey
across to South Australia, so he hoped that gentleman would be the first to travel in
the first train that would cross the continent from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta,
Indeed, he could picture Sir John Forrest enjoying his trip in a luxurious
saloon car on the beautifully laid and even rails of that line, and he sin-
cerely trusted that when he made that journey Sir John would not suffer the
pangs of thirst, such as no doubt he had endured on hig first journey. If
they would allow him to trespass on their patience, he would state one or two facts
in connection with the railway. He had no doubt they were familiar with the
figures, but he believed the statement would’ be read with interest by people’ in other
parts of the Empire. The line in question would be 1,063 miles in length, with the
steepest gradient of lin 80, and the gauge of 4 ft. in. The highest point on the
line would be reached at a distance of 103 miles from Kalgoorlie, at an elevation of

1,354 ft- It was estimated that the line for a considerable part of its length would
pass through good pastoral country, which one day would carry millions of sheep.
He thought, however, that it was difficult to approximate the pastoral, agricultural,
and mineral developments which might be rendered possible by the construction of

that great railway. He understood it was estimated the line would be com-
pleted within three or four years. Tracklaying machines were being procured
to ensure the rapid construction of the line, which it was estimated would cost a
little over £4,000,000. It had been suggested that the line could not be regarded
as a remunerative undertaking. Of course it could not be expected to be profitable
at the outset. That was obvious, but he thought it would be found, as the years
went on, that the Transcontinental line, like similar railways in other parts
of the world, would be a successful undertaking. Certainly it would have
the advantage of bringing Western Australia closer into touch with the rest
of Australia, and in that respect an analogy could be drawn between this line and the
railway that connected British Columbia with the Dominion of Canada. Before
British Columbia became a part of the Dominion of Canada it obtained a written
agreement from the Dominion Government for the construction of a railway to the
Pacific seaboard. That line was eventually carried out, although not so soon as
originally stipulated. He had read an interesting account of the country through
which the line passed at the time it was surveyed. The route traversed 400 miles
of granitic country north of Lake Superior, 1,200 miles of virgin prairie, and 500 miles
of mountain railway had to be laid through almost unexplored passes of the Rocky
and Selkirk Ranges. They all knew the great prosperity that had followed in
Canada as the result of building the Canadian-Pacific Railway. He would give only
one instance of the extraordinary development that had followed in one or two of
the provinces. In 1881 the population of Manitoba was more than 60,000, and last
year it was nearly half a million. The provinces of Alberta and Saskatche-
wan together had 56,000 people 30 years ago. Now the figures exceeded
800,000. In the case of the East-West Railway, so far as he was aware, no agree-
ment had been entered into. There was nothing actually binding in that sense.
At the same time he believed there was an understanding that the line was to be built,
and it was in fulfilment of that obligation that the Commonwealth had decided to
construct it. He hoped that the analogy with the Canadian-Pacific Railway would
be carried to the extent of advancing the prosperity of Western Australia and South
Australia. He thought it was obvious that the line was essential from a strategic
point of view. At present Western Australia was for all practical purposes
cut off from the rest of the continent. If war should occur, and Aus-
tralia lost command of the sea temporarily, it would be impossible to reinforce
troops in Western Australia in the event of that State being threatened by inva-
sion. He did not think that was a likely supposition, but it was perhaps a possible
one. Therefore they must agree that the railway was absolutely necessary on that
ground alone. On the same ground another line, that from north to south, was
essential. He hoped the East-West Railway might be the predecessor of the other,
which would join the Northern Territory to South Australia. Heaven forbid that he
should offer an opinion of his own concerning what route the line should take. The

completion of the East-West Railway would appreciably shorten the time that would
be occupied in the carriage of mails between Australia and England. He believed the
amount of time that would be saved would be 2J2 days, and that was considerable.
The Prime Minister—Three days.
His Excellency said he hoped Mr. Fisher was right. Then again, passengers
would be spared the rather doubtful pleasure of crossing the Bight in the middle of
winter. Many other important advantages could be enumerated, but he would not
do so. They believed and hoped that the East-West line would contribute materi-
ally to the prosperity and progress and development of Australia.
THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The Prime Minister proposed the health of His Excellency the Governor of South
Australia. Speaking on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, he could say how
delighted they were to have Sir Day with them. Sir Day’s speeches on Imperial
affairs had won some attention, and he was sure His Excellency would have some-
thing especially interesting to say.
His Excellency the Governor, in response, said the truth of the remark of the
Governor-General that day that the Transcontinental Railway would give an impetus

of flags and the gatherings of school children at the various
places the visitors had passed through en route to Port

Augusta. The railway was a stupendous work, worthy of the great Commonwealth
of Australia. He wished to add his congratulation to Sir John Forrest upon
the success which had attended his prolonged efforts. The effects of that great
undertaking would be far-reaching, and might be grouped under three heads : —i. Com-
munication ; 2. Australian trade and commerce; 3, Opening up and settling of new
land. There was no subject more important to the development of a new country
than the establishment of rapid and frequent communications with the centres of in-
dustry throughout the world. Those communications, upon which were dependent,
not only the great movements of the human race, but also its industrial and com-
mercial well-being, were governed to a large extent by geographical considerations,
which, on account of the vast distance of that continent from the great centres of
civilisation, were not favourable to rapid communication between Europe and Aus-
tralia. The ceremony at which they had assisted that day was the first step in
the reduction of Australia’s geographical disability, and the consequences which
might be expected to follow the construction of that great line of railway
in the future were therefore worthy of careful consideration. It was of all
things most important that the rapidity of the communications between Aus-
tralia and the British islands should be maintained and accelerated. The

which, were proposed, to be constructed through Southern Persia, should re-
ceive their attention. The Euphrates Valley Railway, which was in course of con-
struction from Scutari on the Bosphorus to Busra, was intended, after traversing Asia
Minor, to terminate at a point at the head of the Persian Gulf, about 30 miles south of
that city. The proposed railway through Southern Persia would connect with the Eu-
phrates Valley line at Busra, pass through Bushire, Shiraz, and Bundar Abbas, and
join the Indian railway system at Karachi. The strait between the north point of
Ceylon and the south point of the Indian Peninsula was capable of being bridged
for railway traffic, and - the distance from Colombo or Point de Galle to Fremantle
might be traversed by fast steamers in six days. In that case it was impossible to
state the exact length of time that would be required for the journey from Sydney or
Melbourne to London, but there would certainly be a reduction of 14 or 15 days on
the -present voyage, and a railway from Broome to the eastern ports would shorten
the journey by another 1,000 miles—7oo miles by sea and 300 by land. The influence
of' the Commonwealth should therefore be thrown into the scales in favour of the
Southern Trans-Persian scheme,: which appeared to be supported by the Liberal Party
in England, and to be opposed by a few. England owed Persia help in the construc-
tion of communications, because for a hundred years she had maintained undisturbed

sway in the Persian Gulf, and yet during that time she had never done anything for
the welfare of the Persian people. The opening of the Panama Canal had also an
important geographical bearing on Australia's lines of communication. The
growth of the world’s trade had gone on at a rapid and increasing rate of late
years. The twentieth century promised to be a period of constantly accelerated sys-
tems of communications throughout the world, in the organisation of which the Com-
monwealth of Australia had that day taken a courageous and important step forward.
THE PRIME MINISTER.
The Prime Minister submitted the toast: —“The Transcontinental Railway.” Hav-
ing discovered that a work was necessary, he said, it was the business of a Parlia-
ment to carry it out. His Government had made a start
with the Transcontinental Railway because it realised that
the work was urgent. There had been a great controversy
Uniform Gauge Required.
over the gauge of the line, but iu the opinion of the Federal Government
the proper gauge had been decided upon. There were seven - transcontinental
railways in North America, built on the 4 ft. By 2 in. gauge. The present
was not the occasion to argue the question. The gauge had been decided,
and the fact that it had been determined by the Commonwealth Government
for the great length of line meant that in the near future it would be the gauge
for the main lines in Australia. Whatever opinions they might have as to what
was the best gauge no one desired to continue the numerous breaks of gauge
in the main lines. He hoped the time was not far distant when travellers
would not have to change trains at midnight. They realised that the railway would
bring the people of the great west in constant contact with the people of the east.
Happily, a great many of the settlers in the west were the sons of settlers in
the east, and by that means they knew what was required in the east and west.
The Western Australian Government had offered the heartiest co-operation in the con-
struction of the line, and had decided to bring its own gauge into conformity with the
Federal line so soon as the latter was constructed. That was an evidence of the
bona fides of the Western Australian people, and he hoped that before the line was
completed an agreement would be arrived at which would make it as successful as en-
gineering skill and good management could do. There were a great many
people who spoke of the railway as passing through a desert. He had been
long enough in Australia and seen enough of it bound up by railways to
know that in what were believed to be the desert places, there was no part of Aus-
tralia so bad as it is named. He had seen so-called desert made fruitful, and, on
the other hand, he had heard people who had a limited knowledge of Australia de-
nouncing the whole of it because they knew nothing about it. By the intro-
duction of water to those desert places they would make them equal to the best of the
other lands. Conservation of water and irrigation would help in the development of

the country, and artesian waters might be tapped by the energy of the men who would
settle along the route. When they found it stated that millions of sheep could be
pastured along the line, they realised that settlement would take place. Even if the
country to be traversed had been a desert, the Government, of which he was the
leader, would have done what it had done to link up the people of the continent.
They often heard of their liability to posterity, but Parliament would have
been neglecting its bounden duty, if, through fear and lack of enterprise, it had
not provided the means of opening up the country. If it had not done so it would
have neglected its fundamental duty, for which it was brought into existence. The
best thing a Parliament could do for posterity was to open up Australia by means of
railways and ports, do away with the anomaly of the break of gauge, and make it easy
for posterity to live happily and comfortably. Of that Parliament the people who lived
afterwards would say that it made easier the road and lighter the load, and enabled
them to progress by honest industry.
THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE.
The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) said he had a double pleasure in being
associated with the toast, because he had the honour to be connected with the depart-
ment which had a special interest in the railway. The eastern portion of the Com-
monwealth could not shoulder the responsibility of defending the western portion if the
sea route was cut off. Therefore, the time was ripe for the railway to be completed.
Pie had also pleasure in being associated with the toast, because he happened to be a
member from Western Australia and a South Australian born. In Western Aus-
tralia they had looked forward to the railwa}' as the most tangible result of
the federation with the eastern States. He desired to pay a tribute to one
who had been associated with the project. That man was not there that day, but
he had been one of the first in Western Australia to propose that that State should
not enter into the Federal bond until the eastern States agreed to construct the
railway. He alluded to the late Mr. F. C. B. Vosper. They had a vast country
in Australia, and they must be bold and brave, even if they had to run the risk of being
called extravagant. He was proud to be associated with the Government which had
undertaken the greatest public work in Australia.
THE MINISTER FOR HOME AFFAIRS.
The Minister for Home Affairs (Hon. King O’Malley) said; —The turn-
ing of the first sod of this great national enterprise the trans-Australian
railway—is one of those supreme occasions, prophetic of Aus-
tralia’s future greatness, which by natural suggestion reminds
us of the extraordinary progress throughout the world that

commenced about the middle of last century, a progress in which Australia,
notwithstanding its youth, has played a most conspicuous and honourable part.
The Luncheon.


It was on July 3, 1850, that the first sod was turned for the 16 miles of rail-
way between Sydney and Parramatta, which was not opened for traffic until Septem-
ber 26, 1855, 5 7 years ago this month. That was the beginning of State owned
or socialistic railways in Australia. While it took over five years to complete
the 16 miles of line referred to, I trust that this 1,060 miles, which is the maiden effort
in railway construction of the Commonwealth Government, will not take more than half
the time. At present, taking into account the multiple tracks, Australia has
no less than 20,000 miles of railway. The following are the mileages of rail-

Africa, 22,905; North America, 283,511; South America, 43,638; Australasia (including
New Zealand), 20,000; world’s total, 640,883. The United Kingdom itself has only
24,000 miles. We see, therefore, that although we are only a small population of four
and a half millions, Australia’s network of railways is already comparable to the
United Kingdom, with ten times the population. To-day we begin the new stretch of
1,060 miles of railway line welding with ribs of steel and bands of iron the eastern to
the western shores of this continent.

On the occasion of such a gigantic undertaking it is not strange that we should
think of some of the scientific revelations and startling movements that have thrilled
the world since the commencement of the first railway con-
structed in Australia. During this period man’s genius has
dazzled humanity in a thousand ways heretofore unparalleled

in history, in the development of great engines of construction and destruction; in
laying under perpetual tribute such as was never before possible the sublime resources
of nature; in the immense improvement of steam engines; in the development of the
steam turbine; in the invention of internal combustion engines; and in the use of tur-
bines for availing ourselves of water power. These instruments of civilisation have
made it possible to apply to human progress those boundless reservoirs of energy in
nature which are now being transformed by the magic touch of science to the service
of the human race. Through electricity, by means of the cable, the telephone, and the
wireless message, nearly every part of the world has been brought into intimate con-
tact, and there is now only a very small region of the earth whose affairs are not com-
municated to the rest of humanity within a few hours. It was in 1858 that Sir William
Thomson made his famous discovery of the reflecting galvanometer, and by means of
this instrument it became easy to transmit and receive messages through cables over
long distances. The practical genius of Cyrus Field, that great American financier,
made it possible to perfect the cable, which was not a success until a few years later.
With that commenced this new era, this closer touch of man with man in all parts of
the world; this solidarity of the human race, with its transforming power in the
modern world. In this period the economic and social sciences have totally changed;
the creative force of all change of condition is being realised as never before, and we
have entered upon a new era of progress for humanity.
During this time, namely, since 1850, Australia itself has led the way in several
great movements in the interests of the people. It inaugurated vote by secret ballot
and manhood suffrage in the year 1856; it created the Torrens
Act simplifying the transfer of title to land an 1858, and has
been the first of British communities to extend the idea of
manhood to universal suffrage by adding woman’s suffrage in 1894; and I may men-
tion that South Australia was first to move in this world-wide reform. Australia is a
land where Britain’s children have enjoyed unexampled privileges and prosperity, and
we may liken it to a great temple of liberty, the keystone of whose strongest arch is
universal justice, and the Bill of Rights and our matchless constitution are its solid
foundation. Stone by stone has this temple, grander than the Ephesian dome, been
raised through the long years of toil by patriotic statesmen, beginning with the or-
ganisation of the States and ending with the creation of our magnificent
Commonwealth. Within the sanctuary of this temple all may with free con-
sciences pay the tribute of worship to the things that are highest. Beneath the
shadow of its uplifted walls are clustered our schools and our colleges, our technical

proud political heritage. We have to maintain its beauty, strengthen its founda-
tions, fortify its pillars, expand its utility, and broaden its influence, and we shall need
in the mighty evolution of a truer social life that is appearing all the power that the
school, the college, the institute, the church, the Court, and the Parliaments of the
people can generate, and all the heartening that comes from earnest contemplation
of our destiny. It is not in mammoth fighting machines on land or sea, in aerial
instruments of destruction, or in other material of war that we place our hopes.
These are a necessary evil, but they are only means to an end. We look forward
to Australia’s future as a land glorious, because its political and social progress shall
be unhampered, because its destiny is already splendidly shaping, because the great
Christian party to which I belong is determined to afford every person an
opportunity to make good. The building of this Trans-Australian Railway is but
the outward expression of the Government’s inward ambition. Already on the
eastern shores Australia has her reticulation of railways from north to south, and
this enterprise will similarly bind the east to the west. There can be no doubt that
rapid developments will follow the construction of this railway, for we are already
woven together by the red blood of British kinship, one people with one destiny.
THE PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The South Australian Premier (Hon. A. H. Peake) said he felt it a great honour
to have been asked to respond to that important toast. One feeling was common to all
that day, and that was pleasure in having had the opportunity to participate in the most
interesting ceremony associated with turning the first sod of the east-west railway. His
Excellency the Governor-General had performed his task in a thoroughly work-
manlike manner. There would be but one opinion about the east-west
railway, and that was that it was one of the great constructive national
works which the Commonwealth had undertaken, and which they expected
the Commonwealth Government to follow up by others of that kind. In
the project for the linking of east and west South Australia had always been
in full sympathy, and the South Australian Government had at all times been
anxious and willing to do its best to expedite the project. Sir John Forrest was to be
congratulated upon seeing carried into effect a policy for which he and his State had
stood so long and so strongly. Another great line that they looked forward to, and
without unreasonable delay, was the one that was as essential
as the east-west railway. That was the linking of the
north and south. As the Commonwealth had been boldly en-

Australia. The people of the Commonwealth had always been courageous. They
were bold over all the undertakings to which they put their hands. Federation itself
was a mark of the courage of the people, and so was the overland telegraph line of
the courage of South Australians. The east-west line was further proof of the bold-
ness of the people, and they had exhausted neither their credit nor their boldness yet.
The people of Port Augusta ought to be proud of what had taken place that day.
It was indeed a red-letter day in the history of that great northern town. Long years
ago Port Augusta was planned with a view to a great future. The ample streets and
buildings showed that the residents believed in a future and were going to attain to it.
Although for a long time the town had enjoyed, should they call it a period of rest and
quiet, he believed the bigger future would come with the building of the two transcon-
tinental lines, and that it would be a busy and prosperous one. The gauge diffi-
culty was a somewhat contentious question, and he would not pursue it, except to
say that when the remarks of the Prime Minister showed that a collision was im-
minent, with great skill Mr. Fisher had shunted his engine off to another line.
The question of the gauges in Australia was not yet settled, and it would have to be
settled. The conflicting interests of States’ railways had yet to be brought into har-
mony, and although it might be supposed that the starting of the East-West line on the
4ft. B^4 in. principle would force the issue, the matter had still to be settled by the
States, which had greater interests in the railways than even the Commonwealth Par-
liament. He hoped the very important project of the east-west line would be carried
out most successfully.
SIR JOHN FORREST.
It remained for Sir John Forrest to strike the keynote of a sentiment which
dominated the day’s proceedings. “To-day,” he said, “we know no Opposition. We
forget all parties.” When Sir John rose to respond to the toast of “The Transcon
tinental Railway,” he was greeted with tumults of cheers. The heartiness of the wel-
come affected him visibly, and his tone faltered somewhat as he expressed his thanks.
But there was a clear ring of rejoicing in his voice as he spoke of the glad consummation
of many years of political effort. Sir John said he rose with exceeding great pleasure
to support the toast. As a representative of Western Australia, he felt grateful at the
honour His Majesty the King had done to the historic occasion by that gracious
message. He thanked His Excellency the Governor-
General and others for the kind references which had been
made to himself. He had been a constant advocate of the

undertaking had been laid, and in a few years they would have east and west connected

that town after an overland trip from Western Australia. He remembered the diffi-
culty they had in getting across that arm of the sea. They had to ferry their horses
across the gulf. He had that day a second look at the same place. He saw a fisher
boat there which, if the 42 years had not intervened, would have made him
say it was the boat he came across in with 20 horses and three companions. He
met a man that day who asked him if he remembered him, and who told him he
had met him on that journey in the Gawler Ranges. Sir John thought he looked older
than he did, but he had told him that when he met him he was a boy of 14. He little
thought when he came across in the punt 42 years ago that the next time he came there it
would be on an occasion like that. They occupied five months on that journey, and
were very glad to reach Port Augusta, where they were hospitably received by the resi-
dents. One result of that journey was the establishment of telegraphic communication,
not only between the east and the west of the continent, but, thanks to the en-
terprise of South Australia, with the whole world. The connection of the east and
the west by railway had been a hope, an ambition, and a determination of his for 20
years, and he naturally rejoiced that the strenous battle of advocacy had at length
ended in victory. There was another reason, of a more personal kind. As chief
Minister in Western Australia at the time, it rested with him to some extent
to say whether they should enter the federation or not. He said then that unless

The Luncheon.


he thought they should be connected by a railway within a reasonable time,
he would not advise federation at that juncture. After what he heard from pub-
lic men in the eastern States he pledged himself to the people of Western Australia
that there was no doubt whatever the line would be constructed. That promise,
rather long delayed perhaps, long enough at any rate for some people to feel
despondent, had been fulfilled that day. There was no room at that time for
anything but generosity and good feeling. In his speech in the Federal Parlia-
ment, in May, 1901, he said:—“l look upon a railway to Western Australia as a great
necessary and urgent work, which will bind together irrevocably the peoples of the
eastern and western sides of this great continent.” Ever since that time the representa-
tives of Western Australia in the Federal Parliament had neither faltered nor wavered
from that ideal. The members of the little band had been unanimous. It was
certainly about the only thing upon which they had been unanimous. On
behalf of the people of Western Australia he tendered grateful thanks to all who had
helped to bring the project to fruition. It was not a day for parties or for opposition.
Those who had advocated the line now wished to see the work pushed on, and
to have every endeavour put forward to make it a financial success. They did not want
to be associated with failure. When he opened the Coolgardie water scheme he
received from Mr. Chamberlain a letter in which that statesman said Tt is the big
things that succeed.’ He believed that that big railway would succeed. There was
always an element of risk about great public works, but with knowledge and good
judgment they should be able to succeed. Courage would find its own reward. That
was the view he took on all such projects for the advancement of the Commonwealth.
By the time the line was completed, it would bring about 500,000 good British
people into touch with the eastern States, and they were as enterprising and
progressive as any British people in the world. The railway would not go
into an unproved country. Western Australia was a land with a splendid climate and
fine potentialities. It had an annual trade of 15 millions, owned 6,000,000 sheep and
1,000,000 cattle, had 600,000 acres under wheat, and possessed 3,000 miles of railways,
which was a far greater mileage than some of the other States. Besides that
the country had produced £100,000,000 of gold, of which £6,000,000 was minted last
year. If anyone objected to send a railway to that country they had no faith
in their nation. It was a happy thought that Australia had been equal to the
occasion of providing means of transit, but they were only at the beginning. Those who
had lived in the country long knew that they had made mistakes in the past as to the
value of the land. Improved methods of dealing with the pastoral and agricultural
industries had greatly altered those lands for the better. There were increased
water facilities, and finer telegraphic and telephonic communications, and in
connection with the new railway he desired to mention that the water, about which it
was said there would be a difficulty, would run downhill from Kalgoorlie for 600 miles
along the route. Let them make “ways in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.” It

was permissible for him to take pride in discussing the beneficent results of the railway
and he felt a humble pride in being present at the commencement of a work destined,
in his opinion, to be of such great advantage to the whole of the people of the States.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA’S REPRESENTATIVE.
The only representative of the Western Australian Parliament present was Mr.
Bolton, M.L.A. Having been invited by the Prime Minister to respond on behalf of his
State, Mr. Bolton first of all expressed regret that the exigencies of duty had prevented
the Premier of Western Australia (Mr. Scaddan) from being present. While the great
western State was thankful to the Commonwealth Government
for having put the work of the transcontinental railway
in hand, and for the knowledge that it would not be very long

Western Australia.
before the line would be concluded, there had to be borne in mind the fact that Western
Australia had been pushing on with its share of the work. The State Government
had promised to build a line from Fremantle, connecting with the transcontinental
railway at Kalgoorlie. That would cost at least £1,000,000. It was a big undertak-
ing, but it was worth while. It had been said that Western Australia
would benefit most by the advent of the transcontinental railway. It was too
parochial a matter to enter into, and too parochial a statement to make. Australia
would gain, and not merely Western Australia; that was all that concerned them.
Again, they had been told that the line would traverse a desert. This
might or might not be. He knew that there was any amount of good agricultural
land along the route, and in many districts the line would traverse in Western Aus-
tralia the Government had established farms, and was doing all in its power to develop

agricultural industry. He believed that when both sides of the continent were linked
up, those brethren who had not been west would take an early opportunity of doing
so. Before concluding, he read the following telegram of regret, received during the
morning, from Mr. Scaddan: —“The Government of Western Australia offers its con-
gratulations to-day to the people of the Commonwealth of Australia, its Parliament, and
Government, upon having at last taken practical steps for the construction of the rail-
way line which is to link our brethren of the east with those of the west. I greatly
regret that neither any of my colleagues nor myself can be with you at Port Augusta
on the auspicious occasion of the turning of the first sod of the Transcontinental Rail-
way, and which when completed will consummate the union between east and west.
You will be responding to the toast of the railway at the ceremony, and I trust you
will apologise for our absence, which is due to the fact that Parliament is in session,
and we are in effect so distant from the scene of the ceremony. This must in no way
be taken as indicating any lack of interest. It should also be borne in mind that until
the line is through from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie lengthy absence is involved
when public men and others are called upon to visit the sister States in connection
with ceremonies such as the present or on other important business. At the moment
we have Federal representatives in this State completing all details preparatory to the
commencement and quick construction of the line, and you may assure the Prime
Minister, his colleagues, and the assembled gathering of Parliamentarians and others,
that this Government will do everything possible to hasten the day when the through
line shall be an accomplished fact. In compliance with the undertaking given by this
State, when first urging that the Commonwealth should build the line between Kal-
goorlie and Port Augusta, namely, that Western Australia would promptly construct
a similar line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle, a Bill to authorise the commencement
is now in the committee stage in the Legislative Council, and is expected to be passed
within a few days, when an immediate start in connection with its construction will
be made by this Government. To-day I have notified the Prime Minister of this
Government’s concurrence in the terms of an agreement incidental to the placing of
all preliminary matters on a satisfactory basis. I am glad to state, further, that this
Government and several private firms have secured large contracts for the supply of
sleepers for the Western Australian and South Australian sections of this very impor-
tant line. This Government trusts that as the years pass the Trans-Australian Rail-
way will have proved itself a great factor in the promotion of the commercial and social
intercourse of the citizens of the Commonwealth, and be the means of making more
widely known than is possible by any other means of communication the vastness
of the resources of Western Australia, formerly spoken of as the Cinderella of the
States, but which is undoubtedly fast becoming one of the principal portions of the
great Commonwealth of Australia, of which we are all so justly proud.” That
message expressed the feelings of the Western Australian Government, and he
would be pardoned for reading another message he had just received from an old Port
49


Augusta boy, Mr. F. Gill, now a member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Aus-
tralia. The telegram read as follows: —“Kindly convey my congratulations to the
people of Port Augusta, my old home. Welding last link in chain of States spells
greater development, progress, and security to Australia .and its people.”
THE DISTRICT’S REPRESENTATIVE.
The Hon. A. Poynton, M.P., in submitting the toast of the Prime Minister, said, as
one who had done what he could to secure the consummation of the work begun that day,
he rejoiced at the opportunity to be present on such an auspicious occasion.
As an old resident of the district, where, indeed, he had begun his political career,
he felt it an honour to be there to move the motion.
The Prime Minister briefly replied, thanking them for the honour they had con-
ferred upon him. He added that he had received a number of telegrams from all
parts of Australia congratulating Port Augusta on the inauguration of the great rail-
way.
A souvenir inkstand, manufactured from part of the first rail and the first sleeper
of the line, was presented by the citizens of Port Augusta to Mr. Poynton, in recognition
of his labours in connection with the railway.

CIVIC RECEPTION.
After the speeches had been concluded the company went to the Flower Square,
a lawn at the rear of the Town Hall. Here, upon a platform erected for the occasion,
and gaily decorated with flags and streamers, a civil reception was accorded to His
Excellency the Governor-General and His Excellency the Governor.
The Mayor of Port Augusta, having introduced the Chairmen and Councillors
of the corporations of Port Augusta, Port Augusta West, and Davenport, and the
50


District Council of Woolundunga, extended a cordial welcome to His Excellency the
Governor-General, who, he said, was the first Governor-General to visit their town and
district.
THE ADDRESS.
The Town Clerk (Mr. J. Holdsworth) read the address as follows:
To His Excellency the Right Honourable Thomas, Baron Denman, a member
of His Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council, Knight Grand Cross of the
Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, Knight Commander
of the Royal Victorian Order, Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the
Commonwealth of Australia.—May it please Your Excellency—We, the representa-
tives of the Municipal Councils of Port Augusta, Port Augusta West, and Daven-
port, and the District Council of Woolundunga, on behalf of the residents of these
municipalities, desire to extend to Your Excellency on this your first visit to our
port and district, a hearty welcome. We take this opportunity to express our de-
voted loyalty to His Most Gracious Majesty King George V., King of Great
Britain and its Dependencies, and our sincere and deep respect for Your Excellency,
as his representative in the Commonwealth of Australia. We feel assured that
your visit will deepen and strengthen our sentiments of devotion to the Empire.
The significance of your visit is enhanced by the occasion of it. The turning of
the first sod of the Transcontinental Railway from east to west is an event of
such importance in the progress of Australia that your participation in it will
notably distinguish your term of office and your place in the history of the Com-
monwealth. We trust that this great artery of communication and commerce,
opened under auspices so favourable, will prove a binding link between the several
States. We desire to express our intense appreciation of the deep interest shown
by Your Excellency in the well-being of the Commonwealth, and of this, the Cen-
tral State, in particular. We trust that you will retain nothing but happy mem-
ories of your visit to us, and that Your Excellency, Lady Denman, and family
may be spared to enjoy many happy and useful years.—We have the honour
to be, Your Excellency’s obedient servants, T. Hewitson (Mayor), Port Augusta;
James Holdsworth (Town Clerk), Fort Augusta; Edwin B. Francis (Mayor), Port
Augusta West; A. G. Pappin (Mayor), Davenport; W. G. Pryor (Chairman Dis-
trict Council), Woolundunga.
The Governor-General, in reply, said he was indeed grateful for the kind recep-
tion given to him that afternoon. He gathered that his was the first visit of a
Governor-General to Port Augusta, and he ventured to think the present occasion was
a greater distinction for him than for the district, when it was remembered what the
ceremony performed that day meant for the people of Australia. (Applause). He
hoped that it would result in greater prosperity for the town, which he trusted would

one day become one of the great ports of the Commonwealth. His Excellency then
read his official reply to the address as follows: —“Gentlemen—l beg to thank you
for the address of welcome which you have presented to me on behalf of the resi-
dents in the municipalities of Port Augusta and district. I have been honoured
to receive an assurance of your loyal devotion to His Majesty King George V. I
join with you in regarding the occasion of my first visit to Port Augusta as a memor-
able one in the history of the Commonwealth. We are to-day celebrating the com-
mencement of a railway line the completion of which will, I hope and believe, be
fruitful of advantage to the Commonwealth, and promote the sentiment of unity and
patriotism among its citizens. It also cannot fail to bring greater importance and
prosperity to the district which you represent, and I congratulate you most heartily
upon the first step in so auspicious an undertaking.”
TARCOOLA’S GIFT.
The Mayor then, on behalf of the residents of Tarcoola, said he had much plea-
sure in handing to the Governor-General a small gift in the shape of a piece of quartz
richly studded with gold as a mark of appreciation. The residents of that town also
desired him to convey to His Excellency their most sincere congratulations and best
wishes. The ore, he added, was portion of a recent discovery in the Morning Star

Claim. Lord Denman said it gave him a great deal of pleasure to accept at the hands
of the Mayor that valuable gift from the residents of Tarcoola, and he would be much
indebted to the Mayor if he would convey to the inhabitants on that field his ap-
preciation of their action.
THE STATE GOVERNOR HONOURED.
The Mayor said His Excellency the State Governor was paying his first official
visit to the town and district. The Governor’s official visit was looked forward to
with a great deal of pleasure. Sir Day had come under happy auspices in company
with the Prime Minister and on an important occasion. The Town Clerk read an
address as follows: —
To His Excellency, Sir Day Hort Bosanquet, Admiral on the Retired List,
Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Knight Commander of the Most
Honourable Order of the Bath, Governor in and over the State of South Australia
and its Dependencies in the Commonwealth of Australia. —May it please
Your Excellency, We the representatives of the Municipal Councils of
Port Augusta, Port Augusta West, and Davenport, and the District Council of
Woolundunga, on behalf of the inhabitants of these municipalities, desire to extend
to Your Excellency, on this your first official visit to our port and district, a hearty
welcome. We also take this opportunity to express our devoted loyalty to His
Most Gracious Majesty King George V. of Great Britain and its Depen-
dencies, and our sincere and deep respect for Your Excellency as his repre-
sentative in South Australia. We gratefully recognise the interest which by your
travel and personal association you have shown in the well-being of this the
northern district of South Australia. We welcome you the more heartily because
this your first visit (official) to Port Augusta coincides with an event of such im-
portance primarily to Port Augusta and South Australia, and secondly to the Com-
monwealth at large, as the turning of the first sod of the first transcontinental
line in Australia. We congratulate Your Excellency on the circumstance that this
great work, which is designed to bring the various States of the Commonwealth
into closer commercial and Imperial touch with each other, has been inaugurated
during your occupancy of the vice-regal office in South Australia, and we trust that
Your Excellency, Lady Bosanquet, and family will remain with us long enough
to enjoy with us the benefits we expect as the result of this national-enterprise,
and that whether in South Australia or elsewhere you will live to enjoy long life
and happiness.—We have the honour to be, Your Excellency’s obedient servants,
T. Hewitson, Mayor, Port Augusta; Edwin B. Francis, Mayor, Port Augusta
West; James Holdsworth, Town Clerk; A. G. Pappin, Mayor, Davenport; W. G.
Pryor, Chairman District Council Woolundunga.
Civic Reception.


The Governor thanked the Mayor most heartily for the kind words of welcome
and the people for their endorsement of the sentiment. He was pleased to visit Port
Augusta on an occasion that was a source of so much pride and satisfaction to them
all, and he hoped that completion of the railway would mean a new era of pros-
perity for the town and district. Sir Day then read his reply to the address as
follows:—“Their Worships the Mayors of Port Augusta, Port Augusta West, and
Davenport, and the Chairman of the District Council of Woolundunga, and the in-
habitants of those municipalities —As His Majesty’s representative I thank you for
your expressions of loyalty and devotion to the throne and person of His Majesty the
King. I very much appreciate the welcome you have accorded me, and thank you
for your kind words in connection with my family and myself. Interested as I have
been in the past in the welfare of Port Augusta and the surrounding districts, my
interest in the future will, if possible, be deepened, as with the railway between
Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie the development of your town and the surrounding dis-
tricts must rapidly advance, and I feel sure that with the continuance of the energy
and foresight you have always displayed, you will not only rapidly promote your
own interests in the future, but those also of the State of South Australia and the
Commonwealth.”
WELCOME TO THE PRIME MINISTER.
The Mayor said the gathering that afternoon could not disperse without also
tendering a warm welcome to the Prime Minister. They had been hoping to see him
among them for some time, and when asked to come he had informed them he would
be there on an occasion that was worth while. Such an occasion was that in con-
nection with which they had assembled that day. Mr. Fisher thanked them for their
kind welcome, and said he trusted that the work which they had inaugurated that day
—the construction of the Transcontinental Railway from east to west —would only
be the beginning of railways north and south, and through every part of the Com-
monwealth for the development of this great country.
THE BANQUET.
The last of the functions in connection with the historic occasion was the ban-
quet at night, at which nearly 200 guests enjoyed the hospitality of the Commonwealth
Government. The guests of honour included the Governor-General, the State Gov-
ernor, members of Federal and State Parliaments, prominent officials, and the Mayors
and Councillors of local governing bodies. The Prime Minister, who presided, pro-
posed the usual loyal toast, which was duly honoured. He then, in a few con-
gratulatory sentences, proposed “His Excellency the Governor-General.”

SPEECHES AT THE BANQUET.
His Excellency the Governor-General, received with applause, said one fact had
not been mentioned throughout the day’s functions, and that was that when the East-
West line had been completed it would be possible to travel
from Queensland to Western Australia, to the extent
of 5,000 miles, over Australian railways. Travellers who

undertook the journey would enjoy no fewer than five breaks of gauge. He con-
fessed to a dislike for a break in gauge. One break which he particularly disliked
was that at Albury, but probably that would not affect him so much during the en-
suing term. He was not likely to travel so frequently to and from Sydney as he
had done in the past year. Of course, it might be his insular prejudice, but he
did not see any advantage in break of gauge, either for passengers or goods traffic.
One very serious matter was the strategic consideration. The term “strategic”
had been mentioned so frequently during the day that he apologised for again
employing it. In the eloquent speech made by Mr. King O’Malley, to whom they
had all listened with so much interest, that speaker had stated that engines
in preparation for war were a necessary evil, and a necessary evil that
would prevail, he was afraid, for a good many years. They required
to be careful in their preparations for war, and he thought it would be
generally agreed that the defence force of the country was going ahead very well in-
deed, despite certain rather inaccurate and misleading statements that had appeared
in certainly one organ of the London press to the contrary. Wrapped
up in the defence movement was the question of railway transport, in view of the
possible use of the lines in time of war. To send a brigade or a division from South
Australia to Queensland might, if the occasion arose, mean days or even a week.
That would be a serious matter in time of war. The Prime Minister raised
his hopes when he stated that it was hoped to have a uniform gauge in the near
future, but the Premier of South Australia immediately afterwards dashed his hopes
to the ground by throwing cold water on the suggestion. Nevertheless, he was still
hopeful that there might come a uniform gauge between the different States of the
capitals of Australia —at all events, during the present century.
The health of the State Governor was submitted by the Prime Minister, who
remarked that Sir Day Hort Bosanquet had won the hearts of all with whom he was
intimate. The toast was warmly received.
Sir Day Bosanquet, in reply, directed his remarks to the benefits likely to be
derived from the railway in connection with trade and commerce. If the western State
suddenly blossomed into vast prosperity, the eastern States
would immediately feel the benefit, just as Western Australia
would benefit from any impetus given to trade in the eastern

assuredly would be on the completion of the Panama Canal, there would be an enormous

CUSTOMS HOUSE AT PORT AUGUSTA.
Photo bu W. S. Smith, Adelaide
The Mayor of Port Augusta (Mr. T. Hewitson) proposed “The Federal Parlia-
ment.” He remarked that exactly 12 years ago last January, as Mayor of Port
Augusta, he attended by invitation the inauguration of the
Commonwealth in Sydney. He mentioned that fact with
all humility for the purpose of showing that even then the

importance of Port Augusta was recognised. The people of the town
and district felt that they had a special interest in federation, as they were isolated in
the north. They were suffering from the tendency to centralise every interest in the
south, and were led to believe that the solution lay in national internal development by
railway communication. That day they were at the threshold of the
open door. The railway was the national undertaking of a national Parliament. Of
every great and new enterprise there were detractors as well as advocates in all
parties, and that had been the case in connection with the railway. He saw some
present at the gathering who had been strenuous opponents of federation, but their
presence showed that they realised what federation was doing for Australia. If he
asked them to toast the Federal Parliament with enthusiasm it was because they in
The Banquet.


Port Augusta realised that it was to the Federal Parliament they owed the present
occasion with all it meant to Australia in general and Port Augusta in particular.
In honouring the toast they would rise above the level of all party politics or per-
sonal opinion, and in a far serener air pay homage to the conception of the Federal
Parliament as an institution—an institution which as such was like the throne, above
criticism, an institution which was the chief of their national inspirations and the ex-
pression of their national life, one which was created in their sympathies as Britons and
nurtured on their loyal and free traditions as Australians, and an institution sanctified
not only as the monument of statesmen who had modelled it, laboured, and spent their
lives in its service, but one which must'be handed down unsullied to posterity.
The Prime Minister, in response, thanked the Mayor for his kindly reference to
the Australian National Parliament. It was a wise thing in gatherings like the present
to toast the Parliament with enthusiasm, whatever they
might think of the acts of the people who constituted it, be-
cause after all in a country like Australia, where they had
National Ideals.
the broadest franchise and facilities to exercise it, the Parliament was the people’s
own creation. Australia was supposed to have had more general elections than any
other country in the world, and they must remember that they had had four different
opportunities of making the Federal Parliament what they desired it to be. There
had been changes sirlce the first election in 1901, but if he put the question whether
they had been for the better or the worse to the mixed audience in front of him he
would get a mixed reply. In his opinion the changes had been progressive. He
believed the national spirit of Australia was growing, and it arose from the fact that
the Federal spirit was in existence which could create national ideals. A
cynic had said that Parliament did very well if it did not do any injury, but while
it was possible for a man who could put down a £25 deposit and get people to
support , him to be elected to Parliament they would always have a democratic Parlia-
ment. The Parliament had already done an excellent work, for which no
particular party could claim all the credit. In the early days of the Parlia-
ment, there was a tendency to belittle, unfortunately, Australia and Australian affairs
and the acts of the national Parliament, together with its administration. It was re-
gretted that some utterances intended only for the Parliament and Australia reached
other countries, where the people were not so well acquainted with the aspirations of
the inhabitants, with the result that they did infinite mischief for a number of years.
Happily that time had almost passed. The people were becoming better acquainted
with the circumstances of the country, and Australia, he believed, had an honoured
name among the nations of the world, which was a credit to its citizens and a com-
pliment to its Parliament. He was glad that the Government had the opportunity of
meeting the people at that gathering, and only regretted that they were unable to
invite a large number of the citizens of that important district.
The Banquet.


Senator Sir Josiah Symon, who also replied, said they had had “a very rattling
day,” to quote a well-known hunting phrase. The day was a memorable
one to those who had taken part in the proceed-
ings, and it was memorable to Australia judging by
the large number of telegrams which had been read at the

luncheon that afternoon from the Monarch and the Colonial Office downwards
throughout the British Empire. The ceremony, too, had been carried out with the
greatest distinction. Whether the spinifex would entirely disappear or not, they could
all agree with the remark of the Prime Minister that afternoon that it was the duty of
the Commonwealth to build railways for the purpose of opening up and developing the
country. The ceremony that day was worthy of a great occasion. The barrow which

His Excellency the Governor-General handled so deftly came to them hallowed by its
having been used some 30 odd years ago by Sir William Jervois, then Governor of
this State, “prodding his spade into the sand,” as it was said, to inaugurate the great
work —the construction of the first section of the Northern Railway. They had, how-
ever, a far more revered memorial of that event, so to speak, in the person of their
friend, Senator Simon Fraser, who was one of those who built the line. He
also observed from the historical statement of that railway, that he, too, took some
part in that undertaking, for a dispute having arisen with the contractor, he was re-
tained by the Government, and in 1878 or 1879 he visited Port Augusta. That was

not an uninteresting trip, and, he might add, it was not altogether unprofitable.
He thanked the Mayor for his able speech, not merely for the ability
which characterised it, but for the Federal spirit which permeated the remarks. They
had emerged from that time to which the Prime Minister had alluded when there
were shrugs of the shoulders, scoffs, and jeers about the disappointment of federation.
The great Commonwealth was only some 11 years old. He believed the
time would come when Australia would be the Great Britain of the southern seas of
the southern hemisphere. For its patriotic ring he liked the following lines: —
‘Britannia, when thy heart’s a-cold,
And o’er thy grave has grown the moss,
Still, rule Australia shall be trolled
In islands of the Southern Cross.
He agreed with the Mayor that this work of transcontinental railway building
was the national undertaking of the national Parliament. The session of the Federal
Legislature which was soon closing had been one of great
activity, of great energy, and great outlook. It would be
unbecoming for him to express an opinion about the quality

of the work. They had to consider the work of the national Parliament, not from
the standpoint of a few years, but from that of its 12 years’ achievement. The
Commonwealth Parliament was now approaching its dissolution, and it made some
people doubt the wisdom of triennial Parliaments. He knew that there
were many who would very much prefer a somewhat longer period of office. A
new Parliament would soon be chosen, and he thought himself he would be
there. They must not forget that in the Commonwealth was the national Par-
liament of Australia, and he thought his fellow-legislators in the State would recog-
nise that in its hands were the national destinies of the country. The event of that
day stirred the imagination. The East-West Railway was to open a pathway to
the west, a pathway of reality to the true extent of the union. Western Austral
could never again say what she had been in the habit of saying too often, that as far
as the east was from the west, so far had she been removed from the community
of interest and sympathy with the eastern States. Western Australia could
never repeat that again. He joined in the congratulations to Sir John
Forrest, who in season and out of season had made himself busy about
the railway to the western State. All he wished was that they might have Sir John’s
services in connection with another great undertaking. He would have been glad if
Lord Denman could have travelled another 400 miles further north and turned the
first sod of that other line, which would be in a special sense the transcontinental
railway of Australia, because it would bisect their great continent. It would
pierce the very heart of Australia, and he believed it would disclose in the
centre of the continent riches of which they little dreamed. He was glad

to read on the official souvenir distributed that day a declaration of policy
which would enable him to return to Adelaide with a hopeful heart. The
map showed the proposed line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, which was
described in the letterpress as one of the two transcontinental railways, “the
construction of which is to be deferred for the present.” The fact that the western
line has been started was a tribute to the national spirit of the Federal Parliament.
It attested its pride in the quick-growing nationhood of the country and its determina-
tion to subordinate everything pertaining to provincialism. Speaking of the Parlia-
ment itself, he thought there was no prouder service, no higher station, no greater
glory to aspire to than that of contributing in Parliament to the government and

welfare of one’s country, and to preserve to the Commonwealth its strength and
splendour. That should be the aspiration of every citizen. The world had
never before witnessed anything like the Commonwealth, and the responsibility of de-
veloping the rich and glorious country was on the Parliament which the people chose,
and it was the business of the Parliament to carry on the great work and to preserve

nothing stood out with greater prominence than the defence policy which was brought
into operation by the present Government. One interesting feature that day had
been the sending aloft of the Union Jack, the flag of Australia, and the Stars and
Stripes, because if the British Empire and the United States of America went hand in
hand civilisation and the peace of the world were safe. Fie hoped they would be able
to build up a finished structure of the nationality of Australia on the broadest founda-
tions, which would secure perfect union, provide a common defence, and secure the bless-
ings of freedom and happiness of the people and their children. If they
attained that goal they would do that which would echo to the everlasting honour
of the Commonwealth through all the corridors of time.
The Hon. R. W. Foster, M.H.R., who was introduced by the Prime Minister as
representing the Opposition, said there was no opposition in the Federal Parliament at
that time, because they were banded together that night at Port Augusta in bonds of
good-fellowship. He was delighted to know that Federal Min-
isters had seen the great waterway at Port Augusta, which

great continent of Australia, and to provide facilities for filling up the vacant places.
The occasion was a great one for Port Augusta, but he assured them that the South
Australian members in the Federal Parliament desired to make the continent. The
East-West Railway was only the beginning of a big national policy for Australia, and
he hoped that the Federal Government would not wait until the Western Australian
line was completed before it started the line from the south to the north. He trusted
that they would not take the historic wheelbarrow away from Port Augusta, but that it
would be left in the custody of the 'Mayor until the Governor-General came back to
Port Augusta to turn the first sod of the line which would run from the south to the
north. The case was unanswerable for the continuation of the railway from Oodna-
datta to Pine Creek. They could not have an effective system of defence until they
filled up the vacant places on the continent, and the way to fill those up with defenders
was to carry out a national policy of railways.
The Vice-President of the Executive Council (Senator McGregor), who proposed
the State Parliament, said it was a happy circumstance that brought so many mem-
bers of the Federal and State Parliaments- together. ‘ State

other times they were of such a heterogeneous character that it was only diver-
sity of opinion that made them hang together for their own protection. He
argued that the opportunities offered to-day to men to enter Parliament were
better than they had been in the past. Thirty-five years ago he had come to that
part of Australia, and with some humility he added that, like the Governor-
General, he, too, wheeled a barrow, and wielded a pick in the making of the great

Northern. Railway. And like his friend, Senator Simon Fraser, who in those
days rode up and down the line to see that each man gave a fair day’s work for a fair
day’s pay, he little realised that some day he would one day be a member of the
National Parliament of Australia. There were at the present time young men going
through the same experience, but with very little ambition. They were, however,
being trained in a school that would give them a training and experience in the prob-
lems of labour and humanity, and would fit them, if ever they so desired, to take up
their position either in the State or Federal Parliament.
The Premier (Hon. A. H. Peake), who replied on behalf of the State Parliament,
said it must indeed be an important event to justify the double event —two dinners and
two sets of speeches in one day. It was appro-
priate that Senator McGregor should propose the
toast, because for a number of years he had been a valued

member of the Legislative Council of South Australia. The people of Aus-
tralia owed three allegiances—to the Empire, to the Commonwealth, and to the
State, and so long as the Commonwealth and the State Governments operated in their
own spheres of legislative action, the interests of the people would be secured. They
all regretted that their esteemed representative, Mr. T. Burgoyne, the grand old man
of the South Australian Parliament, was unable to be with them on that auspicious oc-
casion. Mr. Burgoyne was carrying the burden of 85 years. Unfortunately he was
not able to join them, but he was sure they were all pleased to think that he was
still able to represent them so worthily in the State Parliament. The
Commonwealth Parliament could never become strong unless it received its strength
from the States, The State Governments were going on with great works of de-
velopment, which were primarily for the benefit of the country, and while they re-
cognised to the fullest extent the importance and the power of the Commonwealth as
a Government, they were not unmindful of the interests and the rights of the State.
The Commissioner of Public Works (Hon. R. Butler) said the Public Works
Department in South Australia would be ready at all times to give the Commonwealth
Government every legitimate assistance they could in carrying
out the great work they had inaugurated that day.
When the railway was completed he hoped the Government

of the day in the Federal arena would not forget that the fairest city in Aus-
tralia was situated something like 200 miles south of Port Augusta. When the
railway went straight through to the north, South Australia would be the great carry-
ing State of the Commonwealth. It was no use sweeping away border duties if they
did not permit the trade to go to its natural outlets. At present goods were hauled
thousands of miles away from their proper outlet. The very essence of federation
was Interstate free trade.

The Hon. J. Verran said if the Federal Parliament was to be the truly national

had had faith in the Federal Parliament. He had no fears about the
railway, and wished for it a magnificent success. Australia was now only fulfilling the
promise made by one of the greatest democrats that had ever ruled Australia —the
Right Hon. C. C. Kingston.
Mr. Poynton, M.P., proposed the toast of “Port Augusta and district.” The
port, with its capacity for deep sea ships and with its facilities for handling large car-
goes, was second to none in South Australia. The building
of the railway to the west marked a new era in Port Augusta,
and when they looked at the map and realised the great

possibilities in the northern country, they must realise that they were neglecting
their opportunities unless they had railways stretching out into that country. The
time must come when Port Augusta would be connected with the Territory by rail-
way.
Mr, Moseley, M.F., responded. He congratulated the people most heartily on the
inauguration of the railway. Without that line Port Augusta would have no future,
and with that line and the one to Pine Creek the port would become the Liverpool
of Australia. He could claim to have been one of those who inaugurated the line, be-
cause in 1883 he, with the late Mr. G. Richardson, approached the Government with
a request for a railway to Phillips Ponds, and the following year he initiated a scheme

for a railway for the first 100 miles towards the Western Australian border, but the
Assembly defeated the proposal. He hoped the northern line would soon be started.
The East-West track would open up good mineral country and pastoral areas, which
would carry millions of sheep.
The Mayor of Davenport (Mr. A. G. Pappin), in also responding, said that Port
Augusta was now coming into its geographical heritage. The function marked a
great step towards the achievement of its hopes. When the two great continental
lines were constructed Port Augusta would come into its own.
The Chairman of the District Council of Woolundunga (Mr. W.' G. Pryor) gave
particulars of the trade of the port. With a railway the western country would ad-
vance, and with increased facilities Tarcoola would become a payable proposition.
The Governor-General proposed the health of the Prime Minister, with whose
name he coupled that of Mr. Shepherd (the Secretary to the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment), who was responsible for many of the arrangements.
The Prime Minister, after giving expression to his thanks, remarked that one
of the speakers had alluded to the historic barrow which was used in connection
with the turning of the first sod ceremony. If the municipality
of Port Augusta would preserve that barrow he would guar-
antee that it would be used when the first sod of

the line from Oodnadatta northwards was being turned. That work
would surely be carried out, but as the end of the present Parliament was in sight it
could not be dealt with this session. However, a promise had been made by the
Federal authorities, and that promise would 'be kept. He hoped that
when the next Parliament assembled the same Government as was then in power
would have the honour of conducting the business in connection with the com-
mencement of the line. He thanked them on behalf of the Government for the uni-
form courtesy received at the hands of the State and the public bodies represented
there that day. He hoped the successful function that day would augur well for the
future of that district and the Commonwealth.
THE ARRANGEMENTS.
The general scheme for the ceremonies was drafted and supervised by the Sec-
retary to the Prime Minister’s Department (Mr. M. L. Shepherd), and the arrange-
ments were carried out without a hitch. Railway transport in South Australia was
in the hands of the Secretary to the Railways Commissioner (Mr. A. N. Day), who,
assisted by the Passenger Superintendent (Mr. B. H. Gillman), drew up plans
for the conveyance and comfort of the 150 guests. On account of the break of
gauge, four special trains were necessary. Catering was a considerable item, pro-
visions and attendants being furnished from Adelaide. The whole undertaking,
which involved a great amount of planning and forethought, was carried through
most satisfactorily.
