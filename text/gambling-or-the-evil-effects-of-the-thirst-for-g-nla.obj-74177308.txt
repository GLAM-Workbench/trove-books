A LECTURE BY RICHARD BIRNIE, Esq.
In the early part of the present century, an old-
fashioned dignitary of the Church of England,
exposed and denonced, in a volume of sermons,
the prevalent vices of his age, Archdeacon Ren-
nell is not lowered in the esteem of a philosopher
by the recognition, real or fancied, of his portrait
in the amusing rhymes of Dr. Syntax, To great
manliness of character, both mental and physical,
he added a simplicity that disarmed indignation,
while it gave confidence to vigorous eloquence.
Rennell was a John Bull, who despised a French-
man fed on frogs, who traced all troubles whatso-
ever to the French Revolution; and if he connected
orthodoxy with roast beef and port, to his honor
be it remembered, he entwined charity with all
three. His sermon on gambling has been emulated
in rhyme, but the vigorous prose of Rennell speaks
its own standing.
GAMBLING.
? To the sordid desire of gaining money without
earning it by an equivalent, the gambler joins a
disposition to fraud, and that of the very meanest
caste. To those who soberly and fairly appreciate
the real nature of human actions, nothing appears
more inconsistent than that societies of men who
have incorporated themselves for the express pur-
pose of gaming, should disclaim fraud or indirec-
tion, or affect t< > drive from their assemblies those
among their associates whose crimes would reflect
disgrace on them. Surely this, to a considerate
mind, is as solemn and refined a banter as can
well be exhibited. For, when we take into view
the vast latitude allowed by the most upright
gamester; when we reflect that, according to their
precious casuistry, every advantage may be legiti-
mately taken of the young, the unwary, the
inebriated, which superior coolness, skill, address
and activity can supply, we must look upon pre-
tences to ? honesty? as a most shameless aggrava-
tion of their crime. Even if it were possible that,
in his own practices a man might be a fair
gamester, yet, for the result of the intended frauds
committed by his fellows, he stands deeply
accountable to Grod, to his country, and to his
conscience. To a system necessarily implicated
with fraud; to associations of men, a large majority
of whom subsist by fraud ; to habits calculated to
poison the source and principle of all integrity,
he gives efficacy, countenance and concurrence.
Even his virtues (?) he suffers to be subsidiary to
the cause of vice. He sees with calmness their
depradations committed daily and hourly in his
company, perhaps under his very roof. Yet men
of this description declaim (so deceitful is the
heart of man) against the very knaves they cherish
and protect, and whom, perhaps, with some poor
sophistical refuge for a worn out conscience, they
even imitate. To such let the Scripture speak
with emphatical decision : ? v\ hen thou sawest a
thief, then thou consentedest unto him.? ? Thus
far'the sententious Archdeacon, whose ?simpli-
city ? may, perhaps, provoke a smile from Cap-
tain Dudley Smooth, or a contemptuous colonial-
ism from more than one of our Melbourne mil-
lionaires. Yet it cannot be denied that Rennell
shows in this and the following paragraphs of
his master sermon, a power of language no less
impressive than elegant, and a grasp of thought
based on accurate observation of the life of man.
But is gambling limited to cards and dice ? Is
there none by daylight in the share market ?
If wealth gained by the first be no badge of
honor, let the lucky speculator bear in mind that
his own house is of glass, and that to rebuke
"'rouge-et-noir" and ? unlimited loo,? &c., lieth
no wise in his mouth, even though he be one
who delights in tea meetings, and be a zealous
member of evangelising societies. In the first,
the capital is, perhaps, not wholly lost, it exists
on the table or in the stakes of the player. In
the other case, it is gone, gone irretrievably,
until the loser can re-coup himself from some
? new chum,? or distant resident, from whom (to
quote Baron Alderson) he most ?unfairly con-
ceals the knowledge he may have fairly enough
gained.? What a flood of gambling, in its most
reckless, ruthless, and demoralising form hath
been poured upon colonial society by over en-


couragement of mining. The records of the In- rob one to whom I owe much,? &c. And the
solvent Court, the complex litigations of the
Supreme Court, the Alps on Alps of fresh legis-
lation coming and to come, all speak in a voice
that will be heard?that we are in danger of
becoming a nation of gamblers. The heart of the
gambler is dead to patriotism, to principle, to
social, or even to domestic love. Like the Giant-
Demon in Yathec, he still craves for the life-
blood of innocent worth. For the steady, con-
tinuous industry, by which society is benefited,
while the individual is enriched, he has lost all
relish, and extirpated all power. Win or lose,
he lives and dies unprofitable; his wealth with-
out honor; his poverty without sympathy. Even
the turf is by some thought useful to society,
and it certainly supports much skill, labor, and
aptitude, though too many have proved its
deteriorating power by the ruin of a once fair
reputation. But the gambler in mining is a
blessing to none; his moral sense has so long
been blunted, that even a position of trust, which
perhaps he once deemed the height of his am-
bition is now valued only as a means of ? self-
help.? Language itself is changed for the worse
by these doomed ones; they corrupt everything
they touch. The two words that once conveyed
all that morality could approve or friendship pray
for now mean embezzlement or breach of trust.
The very history of a word is often pregnant
with valuable evidence of essential changes in
life and conduct. The records of our criminal
courts must arrest the attention of the most
indifferent, and rouse the most thoughtless to
serious reflection. A young man, in a position
of trust, blest with education, and free from ap-
parent gross vice, ? helps himself?? from the funds
of his employer to meet a ? sudden exigency
he falsifies the account books, speculating on the
confidence reposed by them in his integrity and
good principles. He then emulates, with jocose
gaiety, the conduct of the Unjust Steward in the
Parable, and ? speculates ? on the condonation of
his original ï¿½rime, in the joy of their recovery of
the property he could not use. Who can doubt
that Dixon had lost the balance of his moral
faculties by reckless speculation caused by inter-
mittent successes in mining or other speculations.
Gambling in any shape is detrimental to the
moral endowments of man. Gambling in this
shape is the worst of the worst. It leads
directly as well as indirectly to a lax probity.
Almost every young man, who stands in the dock
for embezzlement, appeals to, and sometimes
wins, the compassion of inexperienced spectators,
by the touching defence ? I never meant to rob
my employer. Had I not had a sanguine hope,
all but a positive certainty, of success that would
have enabled me to replace the sum, with ample
interest, I availed myself of-?never, never,
would I have so stultified my belongings, as to
soft-hearted employer (to the honor of human
nature he it said) sometimes intercedes, but is
baffled by the clearer head of the presiding
Judge. Are these examples rare ? Are they
doubtful ? Are not these cases distinguishable
from those of mere plunder, ruffianism, and
coarse depravity ? Answer ye, who ever read a
paper, or ever walk forth from homes. By some
it may be said these cases differ from the more
ordinary crimes, by being more demurely
dangerous, and, therefore, by the weak more
sentimentally pitied ; by gentler natures they are
most lamented, without vindictive sternness,
because they appear to them to be prophetic of
future demoralisation spreading through the
very class from whom most is hoped. But by all
their importance, their saddening nature
and increasing proclivity must be recognised,
cannot be ignored, and demand a cure not only
adequate, but prompt. Our old divine
hath yet another count in his indictment against
the gambler.
FEROCITY.
? But, in addition to fraud, and all
its train of crimes ; propensities, and
habits of a very different complexion which
enter into the composition of a gamester, a most
ungovernable ferocity of disposition, however for
a time disguised and latent is invariably the
result of his system of conduct. Jealousy, rage,
and revenge exist amongst gamesters in their
worst and most frantic excesses, and end fre-
quently in consequences of the most atrocious
violence and outrage. By perpetual agitation
the malignant passions spurn and overwhelm
every boundary which discretion and conscience
can oppose. From what source are we to trace
a very large number of those murders, sanctioned
or palliated, indeed, by custom; but which
stand, at the tribunal of God, precisely upon the
same ground with every other species of murder ?
From the gaming table, from the nocturnal re-
ceptacles of distraction and frenzy, the duellist
rushes with his hand uplifted against his
brother?s life. Those who are yet on the thresh-
hold of these habits should be warned that how-
ever calm their natural temperament, however
meek and placable their disposition, yet that
by the events which every moment arise, they
stand exposed to the ungovernable fury of them-
selves and others. In the midst of fraud, pro-
tected by menance on the one hand, and on the
other by despair; irritated by a recollection of
the meanness of the artifices, and the baseness
of the hands by which utter and remediless ruin
has been inflicted ; in the midst of these feelings
of horror and distraction, it is that the voice of
brethren?s blood crieth unto God from the ground,
and now art thou cursed from the earth, which
hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother?s


blood from thy band. Not only thou, who
actually sheddest this blood, but thou who art
the artificer of death; thou who administerest
incentives to these habits; who disseminatest
the practice of them; improvest the skill in
them; sharpenest the propensities to them ?at
thy hands will it be required, surely, at the
tribunal of God, in the next world, and perhaps,
in most instances, in His distributive and most
awful dispensations, towards thee and thine
here on earth.? The old-fashioned practice of
duelling is so effectually forgotten, that we were
surprised to see even on the stage in a late
performance, all its formula and etiquette appear-
ing to be utterly unknown. The morris dance is
better understood. We have no wish to point
out the minute proofs of an oblivion which we
deem most healthy. But the abolition of duel-
ling is not, necessarily, the cure of ferocity. A
spirit of deadliness in anger is certainly grow-
ing amongst us. To hit a fallen antagonist was
once the symbol of disgrace; to hurl a deadly
missile was once deemed ? un-English,? and the
use of the knife was, half-a-century ago, re-
garded with horror. Yet, let any candid person,
who has travelled 4 up country,? say whether he
has not observed a growing ferocity of disposi-
tion among the working classes. Intermittent
fits of fatuous generosity, the reckless bounty
that wastes and ? eats the sword it fights with,?
are succeeded by violence and deadly blows. We
have ourselves witnessed many such ; and more
arise from cards and mining disputes than ever
from brandy the curse of Australia.
And it must be so. To the disappointment of
loss succeeds the suspicion of foul play, and
in an unbalanced mind, maddened by drink, to
suspect is to avenge. It is not only in Mel-
bourne where the habits of life veneer over and
conceal for a time the rankling revenge that
waits but a plausible pretext for its demure and
hypocritical gratification; or, where education
arrests the course of bad passions, and prompts
the judicious though bitter apology. Gambling
quarrels too often render life savage and precar-
ious in the mining districts, and many a nature,
once as gentle as it was brave, is now changed,
unmanned, by the demon of gambling; once, a
dealer on the square, now, a reckless trickster;
once, a lover of fair play, now, in the casual
quarrel, deadly, and assassin like.
Rennell speaks of ? solemn banter ? and
? mockery.? What think you of this grave
specimen of Melbourne morality, which I extract
from the daily papers. It is worthy of a nation
of gamblers:?
A good story was told us lately by a gentleman who
has had many opportunities of judging of the present
moral feeling which pervades our mercantile com-
munity. He received a commission from an acquain-
tance to purchase iron for him to the value of ï¿½l4OO, to
be paid within fourteen , days, On applying to the
representative of an extensive dealer in this article, the
first question put was whether the intendiug purchaser
was a ?'good mark.? ?Excellent,? was the reply,
? besides the payment may be considered as good as
cash.? The name was then mentioned. ? A very
good name, indeed,? replied the seller ; ? but I would
decline having any transactions with that person. Are
you aware that some time ago he made a settlement
with his creditors ?? Perfectly so,? was the reply,
? he paid them 20s in the pound, besides five per cent,
interest.? ? That is exactly the reason why I refuse to
deal with him, as it shows his perfect 4 inaptitude for
business.? Had he settled with them by paying a com-
position (the smaller the better), I would have had
faith in Mm for then he would have had something
left to begin the world with again, but to pay in full,
when he had the chance of getting off by making a
composition, seems to me so irrational that I would
never trust the man in any matter of business, so I
decline to act on your order. The man is evidently
unfit to take care of himself.?
The case of Mr George Harper against Mr Hugh
M?Devitt, both produce dealers in Sandhurst, in which
plaintiff claimed ï¿½IOOO damages for an assault, was
decided in the Sandhurst Circuit Court on Saturday. It
appeared that the parties along with others, were in the
Town Hall Hotel playing with dice for drinks and for
bets. Plaintiff accused the defendant of not paying
his bets, each called the other a liar, and defendant
then struck plaintiff, and a scuffle ensued, but the par-
ties were separated, defendant being taken out by the
back door, and plaintiff by the front. Almost imme-
diately afterwards, however, plaintiff went round to
where defendant was, and wished it have it out. A
fight at once commenced, and M?Davitt got the worst
of it, having got his head into ? chancery.? He cried
1 to get loose, and to be allowed to take off his coat, and
this Harper magnanimonsly allowed. Defendant, who
who was standing half a dozen yards, had his coat half
off, when he was seen to put his hand in his pocket,
then to withdraw it, and throw sometMng at plaintiff,
and then ran away. Plaintiff put up his hands to his
head, and cried out, ?My God! he has hit me with a
stone.? A doctor was sent for, and it was found that
the skull was fractured above the left eye. For two
months plaintiff was under the doctor?s care. M?Devitt
was not seen to stoop for the stone, and it was con-
jectured he must have got it when put into the yard
after the first scuffle. The jury gave plaintiff damages
to the amount of the ï¿½ 150.
Englishmen once thought other thoughts.
Time was, when such nonduct would have been
the passport to esteem, nay, to honor. Now (alas)
probity is the virtue only of fools. Respect
and esteem are to be earned by dishonesty; and
as to honor, look for it inwardly and subjectively
in rags and starvation?shunned by the weak,
the vain, the dull, and the prosperous. But
objectively and externally, honor you may
indeed find ??tis the laurel crown that decks the
brazen brow of rascality. It were erroneous to
think the worse of a man merely because he has
been the object of caricature, or the original of
some witty and humorous comedy. The
original (so says tradition) that amused
the boy, when travestied into Dr. Syntax,
touched, softened, and modified by the
elegant pen of Plomer Ward, became the
delight and model of grown up ladies and young


curates, as Parson Evelyn, in the once popular the point at which ? liberty? in the governed, an
, ï¿½ rr, ? If J TT I T J.l_ * T 1 J C !_ i ~ 9 J. U ~ I ? Vx ATT
novel of ? Tremaine.? Yet I think I should
prefer one hour with the racy reality, whom
Sydney Smith so mercilessly quizzed, to either
tlie broad burlesque of Combe, or the refined
elegance of Ward. There must have been some-
thing in the man to supply so much capital to
satire, farce and sentiment. And it were not
amiss if those who delight in monotonously
girding at a public man, be he Minister of
Mercy, or Minister of Justice, or what you
will, of those who devote much cleverness and
more inveteracy to their dogged purpose of hold-
ing him up to ridicule, derision, and contempt;
it were well, I submit, if these funny monotonists
would ask themselves what will, be said by the
cool, impartial spectator. ? Surely,? he will say,
?in tin's man there must be something above the
common; some power of making himself
known, felt, and feared. For no man talks or
writes much about that which he despises. _ Con-
temnt is a feeling difficult to simulate as joy is
to disemble, or fear to disguise.? Let us not
complain that we have enemies. They serve us
better than they dream of; are kinder by far
than they mean ; and often more beneficial* than
they can ever perceive. I will read you part of
the poetical sermon of Dr. Svntax, which is not
unworthy of the original. This book was once
deemed highly comical; but contains much
sound sense ;
? How many of the human kind
Who, to their common honour blind,
Look not in any path to stray
But where fell passion leads the way ;
Who, born with ev?ry real claim
To wear the fairest wreath of Fame,
Reject the good by nature given,
And scoff at ev?ry boon of Heaven !
Tes ; such there are, and such we find
At ev?ry point that gives the wind ;
But when, among the crowd, we see
One whom, in prodigality
Fortune and nature had combin?d
To fill his purse and form his mind ;
Whose manly strength is grac?d with ease,
And has the happy pow?r to please ;
Whose cooler moments never heard
The frantic vow to Heav?n preferr?d ;
And near whose steps Repentance bears
The vase of purifying tears;
When such a victim we behold,
Urg?d by the rampant lust of gold,
Yielding his health, his life, his fame,
As off?rings to the God of Game;
The tear grows big in Virtue?s eye,
Pale Reason heaves the poignant sigh;
The guardian spirit turns away,
And Hell enjoys a Holiday.?
? Thou,? says our preacher, ? whom inisterest
unto, and who suppliest the machinery, etc.?
The spirit of the words, if not the letter, would
seem to reach even legislators, and to claim to be
an element of their deliberations. With the nice
line that separates the legislator from the moralist,
? non-interference? in the governing body begins,
we need not concern ourselves. To encourage a
system under which bribery and corruption is
possible, to pass laws that have for their object
only the security of political power in the hands
of the enactors, and to disregard the immoral
practices to which they invite ordinary minds, is
immoral in every point of view. It is not enough
that you feed the hungry?you should deem your-
selves deficient if there he any hungry?not
enough that you should punish crime?your un-
resting object should be its extirpation. True
civilisation is care for the mass. That country
can never prosper whose rulers are indifferent to
the moral effects of the machinery by which they
are supported. Will it lead to bribery and job-
bing? Will it encourage sinister evasions? Will
it quicken the thirst for gold, the gambling demon
who lurks in every human heart 2 Assuredly, if
where much is given much is required, the legis-
lative and governing power should hang their
heads with shame, that such things are possible,
rather than plume themselves on their virtuous
indignation at the scape-goat, or, with short-
sighted policy, fondly imagine that when they have
banned and excommunicated him, they have cured
the evil, and vindicated themselves. This was,
probably, what Edmund Burke meant when he
said, ? The true law-giver ought to have a heart
full of sensibility.? He ought to forego the ad-
vantages of political machinery and collateral sup-
port, if they are to be purchased by giving facilities
to currupt practices, and developing this mad-
ness by temptation. That strong common sense
which Burke elevated by his majestic eloquence
prompted him to say?l forget the exact words?
? Connect with important duties adequate remu-
neration; the fixed and solid rewards of merit in all
her gradations are among the buttresses of virtue.
Legitimate profits are the best arguments against
sinister practices, not merely by blazoning the
guilt, but by combating the temptation.? I know
no better principle for legislation ; place your
high officer above bribery, and avoid giving power
and influence to the low, or to the common-place.
At the risk of being deemed eccentric, I fearlessly
submit, that a very recent exposure, of blushless
exaction and callous immorality, involves, in the
eyes of true morality and lofty sanctions, blame
to more persons than one ; and guarded must be
the tone of the undetected Locket when
called upon to expel a recently detected
brother Peachum. The houses of too
many are built of glass, and they doubt who
shall cast the first stone. When the thirst for
gold is awakened, there is no principle or feeling
that can control it. Were I called on to illustrate
its fearful effects, shall I point to Charles Fox,
sitting up three whole days and nights, dice in
hand ? No. Childish and savage form of gam-


sibling ! I shall point to the expulsion from the this passion once possesses the heart, all the
Jockey Club of George Prince of Wales, for wealth of all the world cannot satiate it. It
j 8 tricks such as you have seen represented in the
, t |? Flying Scud,?' Could no thought of rank dis-
ls graced, and a nation grieved to the core, keep a
prince from turning blackleg ? Shall I point to
j g Lord Sandwich, whose name now appears with every
supper-tray because he could not rise from the table
. to take his meals, but had bread and meat brought
? t to him in the queer combination of dirt, mustard,
and stale bread, that now bears his name ? No.
Look to England?s first baron, a most accomplished
jentleman, possessed of wealth, and of skill in
lis favorite game, Lord De Roos, though his
pearly gains were scarce 41500, could not resist
he tricks of a common pick-pocket. I have
ieard of, and believe of many a gentleman being
ietected in the effort to control fortune.
But I am not now concerned with scenes
that tell their own story and bring their
own retribution. The more we generalise
positive precepts, the wider we extend the defini-
tions of rascality, the more we are in harmony
with the religion we profess, and the more we
bless the humanity we cultivate. Let the mining
Speculator, the land jobber, be called by his right
name ?a gambler. He cannot long remain honest
if any honest man can embark on such pursuits.
And let those in power bear in mind the strong
language of Rennell, that they who share the pro-
fit by the active support of corrupt men share also
the responsibility of ther mischief, and the guilt
of their villainy. I am not advocating a paternal
system. That two men should have the power to
dictate to a third what he shall eat or drink, seems
monstrous to me. But, negatively, I say, thou
shalt not do evil that good may come ; and, the
authors of the corrupt system by which a rogue
gets fat, are, in their measure, not less but more
guilty than he is. This enlarged view arrests our
exultation over detected guilt and leads to calm
reflection, to practical reform, and to charity.
? But we will remedy this,? says Mr Justice Wil-
liams. ? Behold me now a convert to the payment
of members.? I answer. Too late, too late. There
is a point at which even wealth is too late. When
seems like nobler passions, infinite. There is in
the heart of man much that hath never been ex-
plored, many depths never yet sounded. There
are passions that when they have gained a certain
hold, appear not only ineradicable, but infinite in
their increase. The lust of rule for the love of
self, the desire for glory, the ardour of curiosity,
all attest man?s capabilities for the infinite, whether
of good or of evil. Add to a passion of this kind
the slightest element of unselfishness, and our ad-
miration follows our esteem. When Julius Coesar,
rising from the lap of Cleopatra, debated with
eager prodigality of learning and eloquence among
the sages of Egypt, and declares that he would
cheerfully barter all his past conquests, and their
laurels, and quit his present delights to track the
real sources of the Nile, how noble and sublime
appears the picture?yet ?tis but ? the insatiate,?
touched with disinterestedness and courage. If
then this passion be so strong in the human heart
unaided, how guarded should be legislation that
it pander no wise to it, and how great the responsi-
bility on those who, for selfish lust of power,
multiply the instruments and appliances of moral
ruin. In conclusion?the sad cloud that darkens
the fame of Bacon, the callous cynicism of Wal-
pole in an age of vice and infidelity had dried up
the hearts of men, the South Sea madness, the
bubbles of joint stock companies in 1825, and the
railway gambling of 1844, are on record to prove
my words that this * thirst for gold? lurks in every
human heart. We want legislators who will cul-
tivate the paths of continuous industry and real
wealth, the natural resources of the country, the
industry that blesses while it enriches ; parent of
health, stability, and peace. We want moralist
bolder, more robust, and more practical than those
of the pulpit, whose faith in the saying of Plato
is no mere languid assent, ? That country will
prosper whose law-givers are moralists, and whose
moral teachers study polity??that is whose rulers
forget not their responsibility to God, and whose
teachers bear in mind the practical workings of
human laws.
