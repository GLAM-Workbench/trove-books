IY. ?On the Cudgegong Diamond Field, New South Wales. 1

The next appearance of the older lead is at the ? Eocky-ridge,?
where the river, after running northerly for three-quarters of a mile,
along the strike of the metamorphic beds, turns abruptly to the
west. This ridge is a basalt-capped hill on the north side of the
river, running in a north-west direction; it is about a mile long,
with a bold rocky escarpment on its west side, facing the Sandy or
Cudgebeyong Creek. Some tunnels have been driven in, and shafts
sunk on this hill, and tolerably rich deposits of gold were found, but
never followed out. Only in the southern half of the hill have
diamonds been found (all more or less spotted). The drift is remark-
able for the number and size of the agates it contains. The northern
half of ? the ridge ? is underlaid by another outlier of the before-
mentioned doubtful purple conglomerate, into which some tunnels
have been driven in the western escarpment. The basalt is merely
a fringe here, resting against the flank of the conglomerate hill to
the east. A few inches of drift rest upon this conglomerate, in which
a small quantity of nuggetty gold was obtained; and from one
to two inches thickness of lignite, or carbonaceous clay, is seen
between it and the bottom of the basalt. The basalt is intersected
by numerous veins of a mineral allied to kaolin. The purple con-
glomerate is similar in character to that near ? the flat,? and contains,
on some of the joint faces, small spherical crystalline aggregations of
chalybite (carbonate of iron). At the extreme north end of ?the
ridge ? are great quantities of ironstone and conglomerate, but,
from their mode of occurrence, I should imagine them to be part of
the Carboniferous series, which is largely developed further north.
The first diamonds which found their way to Melbourne were obtained

from ?the Eocky,? at Hill?s, or the diamond Claim, in the bend to the
south-west in the centre of the hill. A short distance to the east of
this claim is Eyan?s, from which as much as two ounces of gold to
the load were obtained, as well as a few diamonds. Crossing the
Cudgebeyong Creek, in the bed of which is a horizontally bedded
mass of conglomerate (some part of the Carboniferous series, or
possibly Mesozoic), we arrive at another basalt outlier. The lull
itself is composed of slates, capped with purple conglomerate. A
ring-like fringe of basalt surrounds it, leaving the top uncovered;
while between it and the basalt, Tertiary ferruginous cement and
drift crop out on the flanks of the hill. The decomposed basalt,
from shafts on the north side of the hill, is very full ot kaolin. The
metamorphic beds crop out again a short distance to the west of this
hill. It is difficult to imagine the course taken by the old river from
this point; it could not have gone westerly, as the country consists
of high schist ranges, intersected by numerous greenstone dykes,
running as usual in the strike of the slate rocks. On the south-west
flanks of the ? Eocky-ridge ? the surface is covered with a wash of
drift which is continuous across the river (here running westward)
to the ? Horseshoe bend.? The late Professor Thomson suggested
that the basalt, on arriving at the Cudgebeyong Creek, may have
flowed or been backed up by this tributary for some distance. Ihe
old junction of this creek with the river was probably near the
centre of the ? Eocky-ridge.? ,
The ?Horseshoe bend,? on the south side of the river, is a semi-
circular basalt-capped hill, having its concave side facing the river,
and its convex one resting against the side of the purple con-
glomerate hill, first mentioned as occurring to the north-west ot the
? Two-mile-flat.? The basalt of this hill, like the others, is under-
laid on its north or river side by older drift; the lead dips into the
hill on its western side, but it was not rich either in gold or
diamonds A few diamonds were obtained in the shallow ground
of the northern concavity, and the associated gems were larger there
than anywhere on the whole course of the lead. A fine example of
columnar basalt occurs in a shaft at the south-west horn of the lull.
Between this hill and Hassall?s fence, on the river, the greenstone
dyke west of the ?Two-mile-flat,? which disappeared under the
purpie conglomerate-capped schist hill, again crops out, and crosses
the river. Its course is now somewhat altered, both it, and the
accompanying band of metamorphic rocks, being thrown a few
chains to the west, probably by a fault. From the ??Horseshoe
bend ? in about half a mile south-westerly, we reach Hassall s Hill,
adjoining Mr. Hassall?s property. These hills are separated by a
low schist range. , . ,? . ,
?Hassall?s Hill,? like the ?Horseshoe bend, is nearly semi-
circular, with the horns flattened inwards so as to form two parallel
shoulders, and with its convexity towards the river,?it consists of
basalt overlying older drift. The south-west portion of this hill is
lower than the north-eastern, the denudation having only left a
thickness of about thirty feet of basalt, whilst at the highest part


of the hill there is from 80 to 90 feet. The drift underlies it in
two distinct leads, from north to south, in the centre and west of
the hill, hut not on the east. The leads form a sort of elongated
ellipse. The concavity of the hill faces south-west and the horns
are nearly connected by the lower or more denuded portion of the
flow. In the innermost portion of the concavity, which rises gradu-
ally to the table-topped main mass, a shallow hole exhibits a fine
friable thin-bedded greyish white sandstone, inclosing perfect, but
minute, double hexagonal pyramids of quartz. This is evidently
the top of a hill or island, round which the old river, and subsequent
lava-streams, have flowed. The denudation not having been so
extensive here as on the upper portions of the lead, a greater
width of basalt and increased thickness of the underlying drift is
the result. In the easterly lead, where it curves round to the
south horn, as much as one ounce of gold to the load was obtained ;
but, from the length of time occupied in sinking the shafts (over
five months), it was unprofitable. Some very long drives were put
in, and a few diamonds were obtained, but the area was never
specially worked for diamonds. The rock on the top of the hill
consists of from thirty to forty feet of loose concretionary basalt,
getting denser below, and resting on vertical columnar basalt. The
whole of the upper stratum has been denuded away from the lower
ground. On the south face of the central sandstone hill is a small
shallow lead, which must be the edge of the older drift, resting
against the sandstone island, and now exposed by denudation. A
similar instance occurs again near the apex of the southern horn;
where the basalt of the northern horn nearly joins that of the
southern one, the ground is quite shallow (about 12 feet deep), but
deepens westerly to 30 feet, and contains very large semi-angular
blocks of quartz, and much ? cement.? The south side of the
southern horn was worked, and yielded a few diamonds, but
not much gold. The drift is full of large semi-angular blocks of
quartz, and is a side wash, as the ground dips to the north. The
quartz, from its character, is, in a great measure, derived from veins
in, or in the neighbourhood of, greenstone. In the deepest parts of
the leads the quartz boulders are all perfectly rounded. The richest
diamond claim discovered was situated at about the centre of an
imaginary line joining the two horns ; it was owned by a working
party of miners?Messrs. Cooney, Hennessy, Ward, and others.
Their shaft, sunk to the depth of 61 feet, shows 27 feet of basalt,
resting on brownish-yellow sand, and that again on alternating
sandy, gravelly, and pebbly beds, mostly loose and friable, with
occasional thin layers of ferruginous ? cement.? The whole of the
drift below the basalt had to be very securely slabbed, as the fine
sand runs like water. In their southern drive there are three
distinct veins of very loose granitic quartz detritus, separating, and
alternating with, the gem-bearing veins. These gradually cut out,
going north, and the gem-wash becomes more solid. There is also
a bed consisting entirely of loose and open quartz pebbles, super-
ficially covered with a brownish-black greasy-looking coating of


oxide of manganese. In one of the drives they cut through what
appears to have been a portion of a large tree, lying horizontally in
the cement on the ?bottom,? ?the wood itself had entirely dis-
appeared, and nothing but a hollow- casing or shell of oxide of iron
remained, ?this was internally longitudinally striated, and was
composed of several coats. On the inside were some peculiar
metallic efflorescences presenting the appearance of small round
black velvet buttons, composed of confusedly foliated plates of a
substance, which, when rubbed, assumed the metallic appearance of
graphite, and soiled the fingers. Fragments of drift wood had been
found on the bottom; not silicified like that derived from the
Carboniferous rocks. The gem-stones can be traced most thickly
in slightly cemented (by silica) flesh-coloured veins. The total thick-
ness of the drift is 24 feet, and the bottom dips westerly. On
driving northwards the bottom rose and fell again, and the diamonds
became scarce.
Adjoining the above claim was another, belonging to Messrs. Scott
and Allen, which was 54 feet deep. The ferruginous ? cement ?in
this claim inclosed abundance of pleonaste, zircon, sapphire, and
topaz, with small fragments of brown ferruginous wood, like that
occurring in most of the Tertiary cements in Victoria. The ?cement?
forms but a very small proportion of the drifts, and occurs in irre-
gular thin veins, sometimes fine- and at others coarse-grained.
Other shafts were sunk west and east of these rich claims, but un-
successfully, as they did not appear to possess the few bottom feet
which contained the diamonds. To the north of this, and on the
river-side of the northern horn, another shaft yielded a very heavy
drift, giving an average of one diamond and five pennyweights of
gold to the load. The basalt increases in thickness to the west at
Hassall's fence, whilst the drift diminishes; a shaft there passing
through 32 feet of basalt, and 15 feet of drift. Messrs. Cooney and
party had, up to April, 1870, obtained over 1000 diamonds, and
Scott?s party about 700. The lease of the former party had then
been proved for a distance of 300 feet along their main drive (N. 35�
W.) with a breadth of over 100 feet. A washing of 33 loads yielded
306 diamonds, weighing 74| carats (largest If carats). They have
washed from 1 to 15 diamonds to the load, but the average was
about 5, with 3 dwts. of gold. A washing of from 12 to 15 loads
of Scott?s gave at the rate of 8 diamonds and 3 dwts. of gold to the
load. The small quantity of gold obtained is due to the fact of the
diamonds not being on the bottom, while the gold is, and conse-
quently, a thickness of as much as 5 and 6 feet of wash dirt had to
be taken out, thus reducing the gold per-centage. The southern face
of the northern horn is very shallow ground.
The basalt runs westerly through Mr. Hassall?s fence and into his
paddock, where it is concealed by alluvial soil, and nowhere crops
out again. The diamond ground was supposed to run in that direc-
tion, but, being private property, it had not then been prospected.
Between this and the river,?which, after running a mile westerly
from the ? Eocky-ridge,? turns abruptly to the south, and keeps this


course for two miles, ?we cross another greenstone dyke running in
the same direction as those before mentioned, and crossing the river
about midway in the bend to the south. There are some extensive
alluvial flats between Mr. Hassali?s house and the ford, where the
Wellington Eoad crosses, in which some good gold leads may pro-
bably exist.
Above this crossing place a rocky bar spans the river, consisting
of a dark grey breccia, having a gneissose appearance and associated
with flinty beds. About a mile along the road to the north of this,
on Mr. Lowe?s property, and about miles due west from HassalTs
Hill, is another small basaltic outlier, resting on drift; there are
also several drift or ? made ? hills uncapped by the basalt. These
had been formerly woi?ked for gold. Below this there is no trace of
basalt for seven or eight miles down the river, till a little below
Laby?s Farm, at Uuraby, where there is a vei?y small outlier on the
river bank, but whether the older drift underlies it or not, had not
been pi?oved. ? Made ? hills of drift, apparently the neioer drift,
skirt the river-banks on both sides to its junction with the Macquarie
Eiver, but there is no further trace of basalt on the Cudgegong Eiver;
although there are outlying remains down the valley of the Mac-
quarie Eiver of a former sheet of basalt, which had pei?haps flowed
down the valley of that river, and covered up the Tertiax-y drifts,
which have been worked for gold, at a considerable elevation above
the present river. The rocks down the river are similar in character
to those above, but are less metamorphosed and more shaly, with
interbedded brecciated conglomerates. Syenitic granite crops out
occasionally, and quartz-reefs are very numerous.
About a mile to the north of the northern end of the ? Eocky
ridge ? there has been a small ? rush ? (Cunningham?s) to a gully
and ?made? ridge under the schist ranges forming the eastern
watershed to the Sandy or Cudgebeyong Creek. A nugget weighing
86 ounces was found there, but no diamonds. The sinking varies
from 12 to 20 feet, very little quartz occurs in the wash dirt, and
what there is is angular; but magnesite occurs in considerable quanti-
ties, both massive in large lumps, and as peculiar curved cylindrical
concretions. The ranges at the creek head are everywhere inter-
sected by small quartz veins.
This, then, being the history, at the time of my residence there, of
the diamond-bearing localities, I will next enumerate the various
drifts and the materials of which they are composed.
There are, on the Cudgegong, at least six drifts of different ages,
the oldest of which the late Eev. W. B. Clarke took to be as young
as Pleistocene. I differed from his view, and placed them temporarily
with Older Pliocene, following my Victorian experiences, and later,
in working out the discovery, at the ?Welcome rush? near Stawell,
Victoria, of a bed of marine littoral fossils overlying a gold drift, I
came to the conclusion (see Progress Eeport of the Geological Survey
of Victoria, No. 3, p. 264) that these fossils were probably of Upper
Miocene or Lower Pliocene age, and the gold drift under them much
older. lam now of opinion, after reading the report of my friend


and late colleague, Mr. C. S, Wilkinson (Mines and Mineral Statistics
of New South Wales, 1875, p. 77, et seq.), on the Tin-mines of New
South Wales, that the older diamond drifts must be of the same
age as the older Tin ?leads? of Borah Creek, which also contain
diamonds. 1
In ascending order, commencing with the oldest, they would pro-
bably occur as follows :
1. Upper Miocene, or 1 Older Drift, possibly fluvio-marine, underlying basalt,
Lower Pliocene. / and containing gold, tin, and gems ?no fossils to prove
age. This drift may again be sub-divided into two?one containing
semi-angular quartz (a reef wash), and the other rounded boulders. 2
Lapse of time, during which were formed?
2. Middle Pliocene. ?The Gulgong deep leads with plant-remains, the latter
described by Baron von Mueller. These leads perhaps drain into an
old lake-basin at the head of Reedy Creek.
3. Basaltic overflow, filling lake and flowing down the Cudgegong Valley.
4. Wash of conglomerate pebbles, etc., over the surface of the basalt.
6. Upper Pliocene. ? Newer Drift, fluviatile, and derived from all the above
during the cutting out of a new river channel. To this or the next
division may belong the ? leads,? higher up the river, containing fossil
bones at the Pipeclay Diggings, and cinnabar near the village of
Cudgegong. 3
6. Pleistocene.?The older river channels, now silted up, and below the level of
the present river-bed.
7. Recent. ? The present river-bed.
With regard to these older drifts, it must be borne in mind that
they vary much in position; they are below the river-bed at the
Reedy Creek, and much above it at the Two-mile-flat, the present
river falling at a greater rate than the old river.
The older diamond-bearing drift,'underlying the basalt, is a coarse
and heavy deposit,?some boulders in it weighing several hundred
weights,?for the most part loose, but portions of it united into a
compact conglomerate. It varies greatly in thickness, from a few
inches to 30 feet, according to the irregularities, in some cases, of
its own upper surface, which is not uniformly level; and in other
cases, due to the old river-bed. Huge blocks of hard slate, sand-
stone, quartz, greenstone, and felspathic rock, the two latter often
decomposed into masses of clay, still retaining the original shape of
the boulders, lie at the base of the drift in many parts.
The following are the contents of this drift, which is, however,
very variable in different localities: large and small boulders and
pebbles of quartz, generally coloured a reddish-yellow or brown
externally by oxide of iron; sand of various degrees of fineness;
pebbles and sand cemented by oxides of iron and manganese, or by
both together, the iron coating the quartz in concentric rings, and
1 These are considered by Mr. Wilkinson to be of Miocene age.?R. E , juu.
2 At the time of the formation of the older drift, the Carboniferous rocks to the
east and south-east may have been above the reach of marine action, and so escaped
the denudation ; thus accounting for the absence of any traces of them in the drift.
The denudation of |he Carboniferous rocks may have commenced after the basaltic
outbursts, and during the cutting out of the new river valley.
3 At the Cudgegong cinnabar mine, boulders of coal and sandstone occur in the
drifts, with large sapphires and zircons, but no diamonds or topazes, nor did I find
ruby, though it is stated to occur there.

the manganese in dendritic markings, or as if smoked, and soiling
the fingers when rubbed; a white siliceous cement, sometimes
coloured apple-green by silicate of iron (probably derived from the
veins of green clay, mentioned before as occurring in the joints of
the basalt) quartzite; white, grey, and black flints and slates, the
latter showing oblique lamination, and reticulated with veins of
white quartz, and passing into a breccia; a greenish silico-felspathic
rock or felstone, weathering yellowish-white to a depth of an inch
or more, and ringing, when struck, with a metallic sound, and
generally sculptured into curious forms; hard altered siliceous sand-
stone; schorl rock (a quartzite with nests of schorl); a peculiar hard
white stratified rock, with flattened annular concretions, having
depressed centres, very numerous on the bedding planes; black or
smoky quartz, sometimes inclosing felspar; orthoclase in waterworn
crystals; double hexagonal pyramids of quartz, occasionally rounded ;
bluish opaline quartz in pieces about the size of a pea, showing,
when wetted, a yellow ray; amethystine quartz; silicified wood and
wood opal; jasper (occurring also in the form of beans, since called
by the Bingera miners ? morlops ?), which the miners suppose to
be an unerring indication of the presence of the diamond, for what
reason they could not themselves explain; agates, generally of inferior
quality and colour; carnelian; chalcedony; tourmaline in rounded
crystals; common corundum or adamantine spar, in flattish pieces
showing distinct cleavage planes; black corundum; blue, yellow, and
green sapphire, occasionally double-coloured, in flat plates and
rounded crystals; olivine (?) ; white and brown zircons in rounded
crystals and as a fine sparkling heavy sand ; large quantities of brown
and greenish-black rounded pieces of pleonaste; thin lenticular
plates of pink and violet ruby; white, yellow, and pale - blue
crystallized and rounded topaz, generally of a larger size than any
of the other gems, and showing distinct cleavage planes; beryl (?) ;
a new variety of corundum in rounded opaque grey six-sided prisms,
tapering towards one end ; brookite in flat plates ; titanic iron, and
probably chromite; magnetic iron, sometimes in quantity; and
lastly a jet-black glistening vesicular variety of pleonaste, in flattish
conchoidal grains, exceedingly hard, and cutting glass nearly as well
as the diamond, the vesicles being filled with a magnesian clay.
Wood tin occurs also rarely, and fragments of brown ferruginous
wood have been detected in the cement.
The newer drift, derived from the above, is composed of the same
contents as the older drift, with the addition of boulders of green-
stone and basalt. Semi-angular blocks of the metamorphic rocks
occur, as also the white kaolinic clay from which the magnesite
already mentioned is produced. Osmiridium has been found in
minute silvery scales after amalgamating the gold. A noticeable
feature in this drift is the quantity of small pebbles of flesh-coloured
quartz, derived, I believe, from the Carboniferous conglomerates.
1 The pebbles from these cements have sometimes a very peculiar resinous glaze
on their surfaces, which is certainly not due to friction, as the cavities are equally
glazed as the exposed surfaces. It is probably siliceous.


In the drift also may occasionally, though rarely, be found some
Carboniferous conglomerate pebbles. Eounded pebbles of coral
(Favosites Gothlandica) are not uncommon; shales with Glossopteris,
and various Upper Silurian, or Devonian fossils ( Orthis , Spirifer,
and Crinoidal stems), as before mentioned, together with silicified
wood, have been observed in this drift in the so-called ? floating
reef.? The newest drifts (upper and lower), comprising the present
river-bed, and the older and deeper channels, contain pebbles,
boulders, and shingle of the neighbouring sandstones, slates, cal-
careous grits, red flinty porphyries, felstone, Carboniferous con-
glomerates, quartz of all kinds, greenstone, and silicified wood. A
very noticeable feature in these drifts is the prevalence of blackish
quartz pebbles and grains, inclosing crystalline felspar, which are
evidently derived from the granite of Aaron?s Pass, on the Mudgee
Eoad, south of the village of Cudgegong. The basalt, which might
have been expected to be present, must, from its easy decomposition,
have been entirely washed away, and is nowhere seen except in the
immediate neighbourhood of basalt escarpments. Garnets, in minute
brown rhombic dodecahedrons, with angular replacements, occur,
and also cubes of oxide of iron (pseudomorphs after iron pyrites),
locally termed ? Devil?s dice.? Many diamonds were obtained from
the river-bed; but in every case, only where the older drift has
been discharged into the river by the miners during gold-washing
operations.
The following are descriptions of the gems and other minerals,
found in the diamond drifts, with the analyses of some of them by
the late Professor Thomson.
Diamond. ?The diamond itself is distributed through the older
drift very sparingly and irregularly, and does not appear to be
confined to any particular level in the drift deposit, though the
lower five or six feet are generally taken out by the miners, in
consequence of the certainty of finding gold in that portion. The
fact of the very frequent occurrence of diamonds on the waste heaps
round the mouths of the old shafts sunk for gold, is enough to
suggest that the diamond may occur in the higher portions of the
deposit, since the bottom layers only have been carted to the river
for gold-washing. One diamond, in situ, occurred three feet from
the bottom, imbedded in a mass of loosely cemented quartz pebbles
the size of peas. As regards the weight of the diamonds, the follow-
ing parcels afford a fair average :
106 diamonds weighed 74| carats, the largest If carats.
81 ? ~ 19 ~ ?
HO ? ? 26* ?
10 ~ ~ 0 ~
700 ? ? 161* ?
giving an average of 0-23 carats each, or nearly one carat grain.
The largest gem discovered was a colourless perfect octahedron,
weighing 5f carats; it was found in the river, between the ? Two-
mile-flat ? and the ? Eocky ridge,? at a spot where the older drift
had been discharged in gold-washing. Another large stone, weigh-
ing carats, was found, by a boy, lying on the sandy bed of a dry


creek, running down the centre of the ? Two-rnile-flat.? During the
first five months of systematic washing, over 2,500 diamonds were
discovered, and several thousands more were afterwards obtained;
hut, as the collectors were generally rather reticent as to their finds,
the exact numbers could not be ascertained. The gems were mostly
pellucid and colourless; many have a straw-yellow tint, and tints
of brown, light or dark bottle-green and black are more rarely met
with. One or two opaque black ones have been found, and another
of a dark green colour, with the external appearance of having been
polished with black lead. Black specks within the crystals were
not uncommon. The specific gravity, deduced from a number of
crystals, is 3-44. They all show a well-defined crystalline form,
though irregularities of development are frequent. It is very rare
to meet with fractured stones, and these only on cleavage planes;
water-worn stones I never saw from any direct treatment of the
undisturbed older drift. Some shapeless diamonds occur, but, if
water-worn, the process has not impaired their lustre. They are
never found coated superficially with any foreign matter. When dull
or lustreless, an examination proved it to be caused, not by any
water-wearing or incrustation, but by multitudes of minute angles
and edges of structural planes, which gave a frosted appearance to
the crystal. The forms met with were the octahedron, twin-octa-
hedron, dodecahedron, tris-octahedron, and hexakis-octahedron ; the
two latter are often hemihedral, with curved faces, and are some-
times developed into flat triangular twins. One specimen of the
deltoid dodecahedron or hemihedral triakis-octahedron was found.
The above-named curious triangular twin crystals are, according
to the late Professor Thomson, derivable from the tris-octahedron.
If we regard the latter as an octahedron with a low triangular
pyramid on each of its faces, and out of the eight pyramids we
imagine that only two, corresponding to opposite and parallel octa-
hedral faces, are developed, on applying these two pyramids
together, they would not form a closed figure, but, by twisting one
180� round, we form the triangular twin crystal; or, more simply,
if we inspect a twin-octahedron, there are but two of the original
triangular faces entire; these are opposite and parallel, and, by
replacing these two faces by the corresponding planes of the tris-
octahedron, the rest of the faces of the twin-octahedron may be
obliterated, and the triangular crystal will result. The structural
laminaa are very distinct in some crystals, and many of the octa-
hedrons show these successive layers of growth in a very marked
and beautiful manner. A few show indented angles, and sunk
triangular depressions on their faces, having the apices of the
triangles pointing to the centres of the sides of the triangles in the
main crystal.
Gold. ?Occurs fine, scaly, and occasionally inclosed in quartz.
The quantity is variable, the average being about three pennyweights
to the load of ? wash dirt,?
Osmiridium. ?ln minute silvery scales after amalgamation and
retorting?only from the newer drift.


pieces are coated bluish grey or rusty brown; but the interior is the
same in all, the external differences seeming to be the result of
decomposition. It never occurs in crystals, nor shows any traces of
faces, and has no cleavage; its fracture is conchoidal and jet black,
with a strong vitreous lustre; hardness 8 ; streak grey ; composition
found by analysis:?
Silica (and undecomposed) 2.75
Alumina 64-29
Chromic oxide 4 - 62
Magnesia 21-95
Ferrous oxide 4-49
Metallic iron. Hackly fragments of slightly rusted metal,
evidently derived from the tools used. Analysis failed to detect any
trace of nickel.
Wood tin. ?Rare, and in small pieces.
Titanic acid. ?Probably brookite, in flat red transparent or red-
dish-white translucent plates, with striated surfaces, hut too worn to
distinguish the crystalline form. The plates vary in thickness up to
one-twelfth of an inch, and are often one-fourth of an inch across;
hardness, 6; specific gravity, 4T3; composition found by analysis
to be pure titanic acid, with only a minute trace of iron.
Blade magnetic iron sand. ?Common.
Blade titaniferous iron sand. ?Common.
Tourmaline-schorl. ?Rolled black prisms half an inch long are
common ; small nests of schorl in quartz pebbles rare.
Garnet. ?ln minute brown icositetrahedrons, rare and only occur-
ring in the recent river drifts.
Black vesicular pleonaste. ? Occurs in small grains from one-
twentieth to one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and is very abundant.
It has a dull black surface, but shows a brilliant fracture. Some
Oxygen ratio 3-2 :1 ; Specific gravity 3-77.
The mineral is amorphous and vesicular. The latter character is
remarkable, and the grains do not all show it in the same degree.
One variety (the least abundant) with a lustrous surface shows it
best, the grains resembling a perfect cinder when seen through a
lens. Several pounds weight of this mineral were obtained from each
load of gravel washed, more especially from the newer drift.
Topaz. ?ln waterworn fragments, and sometimes in imperfect
crystals, with terminal planes ; transparent and usually white, rarely
yellow or light blue. This is the largest of the associated
minerals, varying in size up to half an inch in diameter.
Zircon. ?In small rolled pieces, and as a fine heavy sparkling sand
in abundance ; transparent, brown, very pale red, or colourless. They
rarely exceed one-fourth of an inch, apd are mostly smaller ; but are
found higher up the river, and above the diamond fields, in pieces
of much larger size and richer in colour.
Corundum. ?
Yar. (a). Sapphire. ?Transparent, blue, green, yellowish, and particoloured;
too small and of bad colour to be of value.
(5). Adamantine spar. ?Hair-brown and black with chatoyant lustre.

(c) Barklyite. ?An opaque magenta-coloured variety first discovered in Victoria

All the above occur in small fragments (larger higher up the river) in great
abundance.
(d) A variety, locally termed ?mouse dung,? which it much resembles, is
characteristic of the locality. It occurs in six-sided prisms, slightly
barrel-shaped or tapering, with flat end faces; one-fourth of an inch
long, and one-twentieth of an inch in diameter; bluish white, with a few
. dark blue spots, opaque; hardness 9; specific gravity 3 - 59 ; composition

(/). A few large rolled oval pebbles of corundum have also been noticed,
exceeding half an inch, of a mottled dirty white and pink colour, per-
fectly opaque. From their low and variable specific gravity (3-21 to
3-44 and upwards) they appear to be impure massive forms of the
mineral, and possess the requisite hardness. They look like jasper
pebbles, and are probably what are termed ?morlops? by the Bingera
miners. Their specific gravity accounts for their association with the
diamonds in washing off.
Quartz. ?Opaque double hexagonal pyramids, one-eighth to one-fifth of an inch
in diameter, are very common. Quartz pebbles occur of all sizes. The
varieties comprise agate of poor quality, carnelian, gasper, rock crystal ,
smoky quartz, amethystine quartz (rare), and a bluish opaline variety.
Fragments of grey quartz, imbedding felspar, derived from the granite
of Aaron?s Pass, 40 miles up the river, are common. A geode of
chalcedony, having the cavity filled with quartz crystallized iu rhombs,
was also found.
Having thus fully described the geology of this diamond field,
and seeing that the diamond occurs in an old river drift, we are
led to inquire whether the diamond has been drifted, like the other
minerals with which it is associated, and, if so, which of the forma-
tions?lgneous (granite, greenstone, basalt, etc.) or Sedimentary
(Upper Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous or Mesozoic)?has afforded
it ? or, has the diamond grown in the older drift in which it is now
found ?
Diamonds were first reported by the late Rev. W. B. Clarke
(Southern Gold-fields of New South Wales, page 272) from the
Macquarie River in 1860. On this river, at Suitor?s Bar, they were
worked contemporaneously with the Cudgegong, but, owing to
heavy floods, little could be done. The Bingera field was reported
on by Professor Liversidge in 1873 (Mines and Mineral Statistics ot
New South Wales, 1875, p. 104). 1 The Borah Creek (a tributary of

the Gwydir Eiver, New England District, New South Wales) tin and
diamond mines were reported on by my late colleague, Mr. C. S.
Wilkinson (Mines, etc., New South Wales, 1875, p. 79); and at Bald
Hill , near Hill End, Lambaroora, diamonds were also reported on
by Prof. Liversidge (Mines, etc., New South Wales, 1875, p. 115),
where some tolerably large ones were found?one slightly over
three carats (9-6 grains Troy), and another one and a half carats
(4*5 grains Troy). The late Professor Thomson was shown some
diamonds which were said to have been obtained in the sands at
the mouth of the Clarence Eiver; and the writer was shown one
from a drift underlying basalt near Trunkey Creek, Tuena, Aber-
crombie Eiver. In all these instances, with the exception of Borah
Creek, the surrounding country is entirely Palaeozoic, intersected,
however, by dykes and masses of various igneous rocks.
The fact of the diamonds exhibiting structural or growth planes
is, I think, sufficient to enable us to disregard the igneous rocks for
their origin, unless some of these rocks (the granites and green-
stones) are metamorphic. Wohler asserted that the diamond could
not have been formed at a high temperature, least of all by fusion.
Brewster thought that the old conjecture, that diamonds were of
vegetable origin, was confirmed by their optical properties, and
analogy to amber.
The occurrence of tin with the diamond at Borah Creek, New South
Wales, and at Beechworth, Victoria, both in granitic areas, indicates
granite as their possible source; but tin always occurs with diamond,
in small quantity, in the other districts mentioned, which are more
numerous, and all in older sedimentary rock areas.
In Mines and Mineral Statistics of New South Wales, 1875, p. 79,
Mr. Wilkinson states that the Borah Creek tin and diamonds occur
in a newer drift, a wash from the older Miocene drift underlying
the basalt, and that the entire watershed of the country is granitic.
He also notices the occurrence of small black pebbles of jasper,
which seem to him to indicate that the rock producing the diamond
may have been entirely denuded away. On this field the diamonds
average in weight about one carat grain each (the largest 5-5 carat
grains), and their facets and edges are never waterworn or abraded.
On page 88, speaking of diamonds and tin, Mr. Wilkinson states,
?There seems but little doubt that they have been derived from the
older Tertiary gravels ; and this is an agreement with the observa-
tions of the late Professor Thomson and Mr. Norman Taylor on the
Cudgegong diamond field.? Mr. Wilkinson seems partly to have
subscribed to the writer?s view that the older drift is the matrix of
the diamond.
In Captain Burton?s ? Highlands of Brazil,? vol. ii. page 137, he
says, ?For reasons that will presently appear, it (the diamond) is
evidently younger at times than the formation of gold, and it is
probably still forming, and with capacity for growth.? The writer
failed, however, to notice the reasons that were to appear.
Professor Liversidge remarks that the Bingera diamond field is
surrounded by rooks of Devonian or Carboniferous age, but that he


had no fossil evidence. The diamond drift rests on argillaceous
shales with interbedded conglomerates. The miners regard these
conglomerates as being diamond bearing, but without any proof.
He states also that he had not detected any fractured diamonds. 1
If the diamond is derived from the Carboniferous rocks, why is it
not found in the present river-bed (except where tailings have been
washed into it) which abounds in Carboniferous detritus; more
than one-half of the pebbles and boulders consisting of Carboniferous
conglomerates ? Why also is it totally absent, although carefully
looked for, in close proximity to the Carboniferous rocks, as at
Cudgegong, and immediately under their escarpments at Tallawang,
and in all the streams of the upper sources of the river ? It is rare
to find a trace of the Carboniferous rocks in the older drift, and
only occasionally in the newer, whilst they are common in the most
recent river drifts. The sand in the newer drifts is probably the
remains of the Hawkesbury sandstones, which overlie the Carbon-
iferous rocks, and must at one time have had a far wider extension.
The late Rev. W. B. Clarke observed that the occurrence of grains
of graphite in the Hawkesbury rocks looks like an approach towards
the diamond; and, in a letter to the writer, he says that the evidence
of fossil wood must be rejected, as it is found in various formations
of all ages.
If the gem-stones in the older drift (underlying basalt) were derived
from basalt, this basalt must have been older than that now covering
the drift, and there is no trace of such older basalt, if we except that
capping Mount Bocoble, west of Cudgegong, which is of a totally
different character to the Cudgegong flow, and at nearly 1000 feet
higher elevation. We are then driven to the greenstones and
granites for the origin of the gems, and here we are completely at
fault.
The Broombee and Cudgegong limestones (Devonian) may have
supplied the rubies, as they do not occur above the latter place, nor
are topaz or diamond found there.
The gems associated with diamonds are very common in most of the
river drifts of Victoria and New South Wales, but in one instance only
in the former colony, at Beech worth, have diamonds been found.
And, if these gems are derived from igneous or metamorphic rocks,
and their presence is an indication of the diamond, how is it they
are associated in one place and not in another, the surrounding cir-
cumstances being apparently the same ?
Why is the corundum family?all the members of which, or nearly
all, are as hard as the diamond, and harder than all other rocks which
would be at all likely to grind down their angles?rounded and
fractured, and not the diamond, which, although the hardest mineral
known, is brittle and easily fractured on its cleavage planes ?
1 The cinnabar erroneously quoted by Professor Liversidge (from the article by
the late Professor and the writer) as occurring at the Mudgee diamond field, does
not do so. It is found in an old river drift near the village of Cudgegong, over
40 miles higher up the river, and has no connexion whatever with the diamond
drifts.


Why are diamonds, if drifted, so variable in size, being often
larger down the river than nearer their supposed source ?
Why are diamonds, nearly always, more or less contorted from the
true octahedron, forming oblique octahedrons ?
Why are the diamonds, when they occur in the largest quantity,
both larger and purer than when in small quantity ?
Why are diamonds locally variable in aspect, one spot turning out
straw-yellow coloured gems, another with internal black spots, and
another perfectly pure ?
Any answer to the above queries must of necessity lead to the
conclusion that the diamonds have been formed in situ in the older
drift. The writer, for his own part, believes that the so-called asso-
ciation of other gems with the diamond is purely accidental, that
these gems occur at the bottom of the older drift, with the gold ; the
diamonds occurring at irregular depths above it, and their associa-
tion being merely due to the miners taking out some six feet or more
of the drift, and thereby bringing them together in the process of
washing.
All the extracts brought forward by the late Eev. W. B. Clarke, in
his Presidential Address to the Royal Society of New South Wales, in
May, 1870, 1 only prove that a large amount of unreliable and un-
reconcilable data have been collected, which add little or nothing to
our knowledge of the true matrix of the diamond; and, as to how
the diamond has been formed, taking this gem as an illustration of
the purest form of the element carbon, as little is known or likely to
be, as there is of any of the other elementary substances. Until
chemistry throws some light upon the possible modes of formation
of the diamond in nature, and demonstrates the necessity of its
occurrence in metamorphic rocks, it is perhaps as easy to suppose
that the gem may originate in a late Tertiary drift deposit, as in the
most ancient strata of a somewhat similar origin. Quartzites and
quartzose conglomerates occur in Australian Tertiary deposits having
as highly metamorphosed an aspect as those in the Silurian rocks.
If the diamonds have been formed in the older drift, it will account
for their absence in the present river-bed ; on the other hand, if the
diamond has been drifted from its original matrix, either it might be
expected to occur in the river, where it has never yet been detected,
or, its matrix has been entirely denuded away in older Pliocene or
earlier times. Large areas of Carboniferous and older strata, as well
as extensive tracts of Tertiary basalt, have disappeared from the river
basin; and some persons have therefore proposed to assign the
original position of the diamond to local and limited deposits in the
demolished Palmozoic rocks.
