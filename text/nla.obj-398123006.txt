siMi ma-ts.
[Speaking to the Orchestra .]
Nay, don’t strike up just yet, please wait a minute ;
Prologue’s a prologue, though there’s not much in it,
And ere the orchestra begins to play,
With your permission I must have my say.
[Then speaking to the audience.']
Ladies and Gentlemen, and (if my words
Reach ears so noble) likewise gpod my Lords !
Were I but blest with Wingfield’s classic Avit
Which charmed last year the boxes and the pit,
And iioav perchance midst venerable laA\ s
ThroAvs rays of genius o’er each dingy cause,
Then should my lash of satire be severe
On all —except ourselves —that AA r e see here:
Then might I tell you everything that's Avrong
Or weak, or wild, or Avicked, in Hongkong;
The sins, the scandals, that each day lecoids
From social squabbles up to opium frauds;
Because, you knoAV, the actor on the stage
Has well been termed the censor of the age,
And men, avlio sleep in churches, may be taught
By moral plays to do the things they ought.
Yet not to us is the high mission given
To guide poor wanderers’ steps the way to heaven:
Enough if by a little harmless mirth
We cheer your passage through this dreary earth.


And, many a thousand miles from Britain’s strand,
Speaking home’s language in so strange a land,
Leaving to other tongues and other hours
Sermons and lectures and instructive powers,
With all the skill we can, we mean to use
Our modest strength your leisure to amuse.
Behold then first this new and gorgeous fane
Which with some dollars and no little pain,
Celestial hands, labouring long months for you,
Have framed of poles and planks and tough bamboo.
No bricks and mortar, not a block of stone
Have come to give our Comic Muse her throne.
And while with knotted reeds the “fabric sprung
“No workman’s axe, no ponderous hammer rung.”
Hence should you deem our theatre is not strong enough,
Strengthen our weakness, by applauding long enough!
For even painted'calico, and gauze,
Gain real strength, when graced by your applause. (
'Aside.'] (To give them time to clap their hands, I pause.) i
Not all to-night to pure rejoicing give ]
Nor all your thoughts to those who midst us live.
It were not meet that this our opening day i
Should in unmingled laughter pass away.
Fond memory brings before the faithful eye
The lights of other days that have gone by. i
We mourn for Coxon ; how he walked the boards
And seemed unfit for less compeers than Lords !
While Twiss and Taylor raised the willing laugh
And Miss Piano scorned a “better half,”
And Stanley with his Wingfield did combine
To give fresh grace to every sparkling line. (
These friends have left us—o’er the briny main
To other lands they have embarked again.
All happiness be with them ! grant we may
Find in our realm “ five hundred good as they !”
I’m not quite sure that this was the best place
To use the hackney’d line from Chevy Chase :
My meaning is: new hands must make amends (


And fill the aching void of absent friends.
What more can ye desire ? attend and hear
The glorious news, Watmore himself is here !
Sound the loud trumpet, beat the noisy drums,
In undiminished vigour Cupid comes !
(Between ourselves “Cupid” is all a myth—
Behind the scenes he signs himself Fred. Smith ;
No matter what the name, so that he be
This year—as last—a source of jollity.)
Miss Alexander too (you’ve not forgot her ?)
Is with us our Stage Manager is Potter,
And ’tis his wish that I should not proclaim
To-night before you any other name.
Suffice it one and all will do their best,
Leaving to your indulgence all the rest.
To our good points, if any, be most kind.
To our shortcomings deaf—and dumb—and blind.
And when you think that each man has his part (
Midst other daily toils to get by heart, —
That what we seek is not the world’s renown,
The poet’s laurel, or the artist’s crown, ,
Or sacks of dollars, that repay the notes <
Melodious issuing from Italian throats, —
But purely, simply, your dear selves to please—
To aid your exiled hours to pass with ease — (
We do not —can not—doubt you’ll see ’tis clear
That each brave man and lady fair who’s here
Should pay your servants’ zeal with one long, hearty cheer/
