ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.

3n the beginning
A number of the pioneers of religion
in Queensland came out in the ship
?Fortitude,? which reached Moreton Bay
on 21st January, 1849. Two of them
found their way to the small town of
Ipswich, on the Bremer River. They
were Dr. Henry Challinor and Samuel
Welsby a school teacher. At that time
no regular religious services were being
held in the town. There were about
800 people living there, and life was rude
and bare. Samuel Welsby, supported
by Dr. Challinor, began regular reli-
gious Services, probably the first regular
Services in the little town.
In 1851, Rev. Thomas Deacon, a re-
tired Baptist minister, came to live
with his son in Ipswich. He took up the
work begun by Samuel Welsby and for
about two years preached regularly, first
in the Court House, then in a small
four-roomed cottage with the dividing
walls removed. This building stood
where Deacon?s Chambers are, next to
the Commonwealth Bank in Nicholas
Street. This was the first building in
Ipswich set apart exclusively for re-
ligious purposes.
The Church Formed .
At a meeting held in this building on
17th March, 1853, it was decided to form
a United Congregational Church, to in-
clude the denominations called Baptists
and Independents. The foundation
members who received the right hand
of fellowship at a meeting held on 20th
April, 1853, were?Thomas Deacon, Eliza-
beth Welsby, Louisa Southerden. Eliza
Shenton, John Clarke Foote, Thomas
Edwards, Thomas Birr, Mary Bower,
Mary Anne Foote.
The Rev. Thomas Deacon was con-
firmed in the pastorate of the Church,
nnd Henry Challinor and Samuel P.
Welsby were appointed Deacons at a
meeting held on 25th April, 1853.
At a meeting held on Ist July of the
REV. THOMAS DEACON
same year the first new member, Samuel
Francis Whitehead, was nominated and
accepted, and this name has remained
in association with the Church right
throughout the hundred years.
A New Minister.
Rev. Thomas Deacon had accepted
the pastorate to hold it until a younger
man could be found. Negotiations were
opened with the Colonial Missionary
Society and a minister, Rev. Edward
Griffith, recommended by the society,
arrived from England in March, 1854.
He preached with great acceptance, and

at a Church Meeting was given a unani-
mous invitation to become Pastor. Mr.
Griffith accepted the invitation, and
Rev. Thomas Deacon resigned. At the
same meeting it was decided to rescind
the resolution of 1853 naming the Church.
The name in future was to be ?Con-
gregational Church? and ?all members
forming its fellowship, whether Bap-
tists or Congregationalists, shall enjoy
equal privileges.?
In 1860, Mr. Deacon and his family
were associated with the foundation of
Central Baptist Church, Mr. Deacon
becoming the first pastor. Later, mem-
bers of the family came back to the
Congregational Church, and the asso-
ciation is still maintained by Miss Ger-
trude Deacon, who, although living in
Sydney, maintains her association by
occasional visits.
A Church Building,
Mr. Griffith found that already the
small group had begun to plan for a new
building. Led by the new Minister a build-
ing committee went ahead. A grant of
�4OO came from the Home Missionary
Society in Sydney for the purchase of a
site and help in building. Some years
later the loan was written off in full on
payment of �lOO. The new Church in
Brisbane Street, on the present site, was
opened on 11th March, 1855. It was the
first Congregational Church built in Queens-
land. The opening Services were taken
by Rev. Dr. Nelson, of the Presbyterian
Church, and the minister, Rev. Edward
Griffith.
A Settled Ministry,
From the (first the Church had a
settled ministry. This proved of great
value. It always does. It was a heavy
financial burden for the small group
who made up the membership, but gen-
erous aid came from the Colonial Mis-
sionary Society, London, and the Home
Missionary Society, Sydney. During Mr.
Griffith?s years, about half the stipend
came from these mission agencies. Cen-
tral has generously helped others down
the years, Central was generously
helped by others in her early struggle.
A Great Pioneer,
Rev. Edward Griffith resigned after
a pastorate of two years and four
months. He was succeeded in August,
1856, by Rev. J. T. Waraker, who came
from Maitland, N.S.W. Mr. Waraker
was a great pioneer, a man of great
energy, who was always looking to
?fields afar.? A Sunday School, and
soon after a regular preaching service,
began at Little Ipswich (West Ipswich).
This work was no sooner started than
Services began at Bremer Mills, on the
banks of the river near where Bun-
damba now stands.
The Church purchased a horse for
the Minister, and Mr. Waraker and the
horse soon became well known in Ips-
wich, West Moreton, and upon the
Downs. He rode to Toowoomba, Dray-
ton, and Warwick, preaching the Gos-
pel and organising Sunday Schools. At
the beginning of 1859, the year Queens-
land became a separate colony, steps
were taken to erect a Church in Too-
woomba.
Church Music,
In those far away days the hymns
were sung without the aid of a musical
instrument, and the people remained
seated while singing. The Hymn Book
used was the Book of Dr. Isaac Watts,
and it had a very real place in the
hearts of Congregationalists. Their
judgment was sound, for today, a
hundred years later, the best judges
would say that Isaac Watts is the best
of Congregational hymn writers. A later
book was given a place alongside Watts?

book in the praise of the young Church,
it was called the Congregational Hymn
Book. It is of interest that Central has
always moved with the times and
adopted each new Hymn Book as it has
become available. The Congregational
Hymnal published in 1887, was used for
years, then the Congregational Hymn-
ary, which we still use, and now we
look forward to soon having the new
Congregational Praise which is now
available in England.
It was in Mr. Waraker?s day that the
Church consented to introduce a musi-
cal instrument. There was much dis-
cussion about it. Some were very
doubtful as to its value. Finally the
following wise resolution was carried ?
?That the Church consents to the in-
troduction of instrumental music into
the public Services of the sanctuary
with a view to assist, and not to super-
sede, the Congregational psalmody.
Ministerial Change.
Rev. J. T. Waraker resigned in December,
1859. Toowoomba had been such a success
that it could maintain a full-time minister
and Mr. Waraker felt that he should become
the first resident pastor there. The Church
was to have some months without a minis-
ter. Those were critical days. Central Bap-
tist Church was forming, and some of the
original Baptist members of Central felt
they should transfer to the Baptist Church.
It is of interest that some came back later.
For instance Mr. and Mrs. A. Femister
joined Central in 1855, transferred to the
Baptist Church in August, 1860, and came
back to us in March, 1867. And some of
their descendants are still with us. The early
leaders, Henry Challinor, Samuel Welsby,
and S. F. Whitehead, held on firmly, and
were soon reinforced by H. W. Reeve, who
had met Rev. Edward Griffith and family
when they stepped ashore from the river
steamer ?Hawk? in March, 1854. In 1859
Robert Cribb, Jnr., at that time one of the
partners of Cribb & Foote, became a mem-
ber, and soon was a Deacon.
Rev. J. C. W. Drane.
At last, in April, 1861, Rev. J. W. C. Drane
began his ministry. He was just the kind
of man needed at that time. Mr. Waraker
had moved out to establish new causes. Mr.
Drane could not have done that kind of
work. He was physically a frail man, in-
deed a sick man for many months of a
three-year pastorate. But he was cultured,
consecrated, and a fine preacher. Central
needed consolidation at the centre. And this
came in the cultured ministry of Mr. Drane.
He was also keenly interested in training
young men for the ministry. Two men who
were to have successful ministries in the
years ahead, Messrs. J. C. Kirby and S. T.
Green, had early tuition from Mr. Drane.
Two events of great interest at this time
are, the formation of the Congregational
Union in October, 1861, and the abolition
of pew rents and substitution of free-will
offering by Central Church.
Solid, But Not Large.
When Mr. Drane concluded his ministry
the membership had increased and there
was now a steady congregation of from 20
to 25. Not large numbers, but it is clear
now that the Congregational Church has
come to Ipswich to stay. In June, 1864,
Mr. Drane retired owing to ill-health, and
died in December. He was a good man, and
the seed he had scattered sprang to life in
the years that followed.
Rev. Thomas Jenkyns , M.A.
Mr. Jenkyns had come out to Australia
under the auspices of the Colonial Mission-
ary Society. He was a man of ability and
spiritual power and was in Ipswich for two
and a half years. While good work was
done, this was not a very happy period in
the life of the Church. The first break
came in the Diaconate when Mr. Robert
Cribb, Jnr., who was beloved by all, passed
away in June, 1866. The Church was still
ready for forward work and a fresh preach-
ing place was opened at Pine Mountain. Mr.
Jenkyns resigned in 1867.


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.

The New Church.
For over eighteen months the Church
carried on without a minister. A num-
ber of new members came in at that time
The Church was in good heart and when
Rev. David Mossop, at the second in-
vitation, became minister in December,
1868, he found all ready for work. And
it was well, for he was a man of great
energy and fine faith. Very soon new
work was taken up at Amberley. Then
came one of the big events in the life of
the Church, the laying of the Foundation
Stone of the present Church by Governor
Blackall in January, 1870.' The building
was ready before the end of the year and
was dedicated free of debt on the 4th De-
cember. The preachers on that day were
Revs. Edward Griffith and J. T. Gammie.
The building cost �2,200, and the con-
tractors were Messrs. Hancock and Shenton.
The Church was formed into a corporate
body (Religious Institutions Act, 1861) in
September, 1871. In that same year Mr.
S. F. Whitehead retired from the Diacon-
ate and the Secretaryship. He had render-
ed capable and loyal service for eighteen
years. Later, Mr. Whitehead entered the
Ministry and had charge of Gatton for
some years.
Rev. F. H. Browne.
Rev. David Mossop resigned in June, 1873,
when he accepted an invitation to Newtown,
N.S.W. Six months later Rev. P. H. Browne,
of Petersham, N.S.W., accepted the pastor-
ate. Mr. Browne had visited Ipswich when
a student at Camden College and was known
to our people. The new minister was once
described by one who knew him as a ?Man
of sanctified common sense.? Mr. Browne
began his ministry on 15th February, 1874.
In less than a month the Church lost its
Senior Deacon, Mr. Benjamin Cribb. Mr.
Cribb, his wife, and Mr. and Mrs. T. B.
Cribb joined the Church at the same time in
1869. Mr. Benjamin Cribb became a Deacon
in the same year, and his wise counsel
and loyal service were a great help to the
Church. He passed away suddenly while
seated in Church at a Wednesday evening
service. Prom this family the Church has
now had Deacons of four generations.

Ablaze at that Time.
Rev. W. J. T. Gloss in writing of this
period in the life of the Church says that
"Congregationalism was evidently ablaze
at that time.?? Rev. R. Spence was ap-
pointed as assistant minister, the Diaconate
was increased from four to six, and the
lay preachers increased in number, until
it would seem that Central was like a city
set u;on a hill from which men went
forth to claim the country for Christ. The
work at Gatton, which had begun in 1866,
now became a separate fellowship, also
that at Goodna. Tivoli was taken up and
the work there moved along with every
sign of success. In 1878 the attempt was
made to make the work more permanent
at North Ipswich by securing a site for a
building, but it was not successful. In
1879 Central Church w?s enlarged to ac-
commodate another 150. About the same
time the property at West Ipswich was
given to the Church by Mrs. B. Cribb.
The 25 th Anniversary.
The 25th Anniversary was a great oc-
casion, On the 11th March, 1879, a great
public meeting was held in the School Hall
(the old wooden Church). After one of those
teas that had become famous, the minister,
Rev. F. H. Browne, presided, and on the
platform he had with him Revs. E. Griffith,
J. T. Waraker, and D. Mossop, past minis-
ters, and Rev. R. Spence. There were many
speeches, a brief sketch of the 25 years was
read by the Chairman, and much rejoicing.
Central was now a strong Church.
Brief and Brilliant.
Rev. F. H. Browne moved to Richmond,
Victoria, in December, 1880. He had been
in Ipswich for seven years, easily the longest
ministry up to that time. It was one of
our best ministries. He was succeeded by
Rev. E. Greenwood, who was called on 2nd
March, 1881. Mr. Greenwood agreed to
come for one year, and stayed for a little
over three. The Church records, and the
few who remember him pay tribute to Mr.
Greenwood?s preaching. It was a day of large
congregations and progress. New work be-
gan at Raceview, and the little Church
opened free of debt. A pipe organ was
placed in Central Church. A manse was
built in Quarry Street. The solid building
?work of Rev. P. H. Browne, and the faithful
planting of the seed, was yielding a great
harvest, as Mr. Greenwood with burning
eloquence pressed the claims of Christ upon
the people.
Kev. Joseph Walker.
Rev. E. Greenwood resigned in October,
1884, and Rev. Joseph Walker came from
Ballarat, Victoria, to succeed him in August,
1885. We have come to the longest pas-
torate in the hundred years. Mr. Walker
has been described as an-?all-round? man,
an earnest preacher, a first-class organiser,
a sympathetic pastor, and a man of deep
spirituality. The Church members soon
knew that a real leader of men was among
The Great Floods.
The little Bremer looks so quiet and
peaceful in normal times that the stronger
looks incredulous when told that it once
swept over half the township. In Febru-
ary, 1887, the flood for the first time found
its way into the Church. Much damage
was done, and the congregation moved
out to the School of Arts during renova-
tions. The same thing happened in 1890,
while in 1893 the ?Great Flood? came and
submerged the Church. The Sunday
School (the original wooden Church) could
not stand up to the experience and col-
lapsed. The Church rallied in faith and
courage, and faced the situation. The
organising genius of the minister was now
seen at its best, and standing by his side
was the Sunday School Superintendent,
Mr. J. C. Cribb, M.L.A. Mr. Cribb urged
that a site be secured above flood level
and a new Sunday School building erected.
The people responded to his leadership
and the present large Sunday School build-
ing on the corner of Roderick and East
Streets was built. Many worked hard,
there was real enthusiasm, and the cost of
the building, �4,000, was soon met. When
erected, the Sunday School was probably
the largest building of its kind in Aus-
tralia.
thorn. The growth of the branch Churches
was very marked in the early days of Mr.
Walker?s ministry. He pointed out to his
Deacons that there were opportunities all
around them, and he would like assistants
to help him sieze the opportunities. The
response came, two assistant ministers were
appointed, one, Rev. Edward Wilson, a
Scotchman, the other, Rev. James Davies,
a Welshman. Mr. Wilson was to work north
of the river, and Mr. Davies in Blackstone
and district. The results came. In 1885,
North Ipswich was strong enough to be-
come a separate Church, with Mr. Wilson
as minister, and a grant of money from
Central. Rev. William Brown had been
working at Goodna and Rosewood, his
health failed and he resigned. Central

Church took over his work, appointing yet
another assistant, Rev. T. Roper. When Mr.
Roper moved to Gatton to succeed Rev. S.
F. Whitehead, who had passed away after
years of faithful service, Rev. H. Gibson
succeeded him at Rosewood. Then Rev. H.
Rawlings came into the picture, succeeding
Mr. Gibson at Rosewood and becoming the
founder of Mt. Walker Church. Mr. Rawl-
ings also did excellent work in the Peak
Mountain district; his ministry began there
on the first Sunday in 1877. We are glad
his name still remains with us at Central.
Other names appearing in the record of
branch work in Mr. Walker?s day are those
of Rev. R. Figgis and Rev. J. R. Williams.
Many Activities.
It is not possible to tell of all the many
activities of Mr. Walker?s fourteen years. We
detail some of them. Towards the end of his
pastorate the work began at One Mile. In
1889, Miss Margaret Jones was appointed
district visitor and, under Mr. Walker?s direc-
tion, carefully worked the district. The
Christian Endeavour began in this long and
vigorous ministry. Mr. Walker was a keen
Endeavourer and knew Dr. Clark, the founder
of the movement, personally. The Junior
Society was formed in 1897. Mr. A. S. Cribb
was the first Superintendent and a lad named
John Gray was a foundation member. For
nearly 50 years Mr. John Gray was associated
with the C.E. To see the slight, stooped figure
quietly enter Church, or walk into the En-
deavour Room, or his beloved Sunday School
library, was at once to be reminded of C.E.,
and to think of C.E. was to think of John
Gray. He was a real Endeavourer. This move-
ment has trained many of the best workers
in the life of the Church.
In 1899 Mr. Walker resigned and went
abroad for a long holiday. He left an en-
during mark upon the Church which he so
effectively led. He was succeeded by Rev. W.
J. L. Closs, B A., who came from Summer
Hill, Sydney.
Changes in Branches.
As the century ended (1900), some changes
took place in the branches. A new Church
building was opened at Walloon. Rev. E. Wil-
son moved to Rockhampton and Rev. J. R.
Williams retired from Blackstone. Rev. A.
E. West and Rev. A. Fisher-Webster came
into the district as assistant ministers, and
were to help Mr. Closs prepare for the
Jubilee.
After the Jubilee,
Rev. W. J. L. Gloss, 8.A., very ably led the
preparation for the Jubilee in 1903. His
leadership was very real during the cele-
brations. He wrote the historical booklet
which was published at the Jubilee. With
characteristic modesty he said very little
about his pastorate. He was in charge from
1899 to 1908. They were good and great days.
The strength developed in Mr. Walker?s days
was steadily maintained. Quite a number of
those who are now our senior members, and
are to be found in their place every Sunday,
joined the Church in those early years of the
20th century. The transfer of people from
Old Country Churches, so numerous in the
early days, fell away in Mr. Walker?s day,
and there were very few in the days of Mr,
Gloss. But the local community and the chil-
dren and grand-children of the pioneers were
being gathered into membership.
Individual Cups At
Communion.
In January, 1900, the question of using In-
dividual Cups at Communion was discussed
and in February it was decided to adopt
them. The change was made without any
controversy. In some of our Churches this
change led to long debate and some heart
burning, but Central seems to have moved
quietly to the new way.
Sunday School Anniversary.
The Sunday School Anniversary, which had
become a large gathering in Mr. Walker?s day
became even larger, and after five years in
the new Sunday School building the large
attendances still justified the large building.
More than Central people attended. People
came from far and near. The branch
Churches in some cases had no services on
that day, and no Church in Ipswich had
good congregations when Congregationalists
gathered for their Sunday School Festival.
Mr. Closs had been impressed by the large
congregations from the first, and entered into
the occasion very heartily. But he also saw
the danger, and in 1900 he told a Church
Meeting that he hoped the day would not
degenerate into a mere demonstration. To
face a Central meeting after a stirring Sun-
day School Anniversary, and say that re-
quired courage.


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.

A Double Membership.
For some years it was the custom to regis-
ter new members of the branch Churches as
members of Central also. There is a record
of Blackstone receiving 47 members in one
year, and at once they were registered as
members of both Blackstone and Central.
This was during the vigorous ministry of
Rev. A. Fisher-Webster at Blackstone. This
custom makes it rather difficult to estimate
the effective membership of the Central
Church in those years.
Booval.
In 1905 the Booval Primitive Methodist
Church was purchased for �l2O. The for-
mation of a Fellowship was encouraged,
and it was established in 1906 with the old
proviso that the members be also members
of Central.
The New Church.
In 1904 it was decided to work for a new
Church to be built near the Sunday School.
Mr. H. M. Scott presented a report of the
Building Committee, which said that a new
Church was desirable. It should seat 650
to 800 and would cost about �4OOO. This subject
has come before the Church again and again
through the years. In all the discussions
there is an amazing similarity. The desir-
ability of the new Church has often been ex-
pressed, but the Church does not move be-
yond that point.
Junior Church.
In these days we often hear discussions
about the Junior Church idea. It varies from
being a new name for the Sunday School to
being a new organisation in which children
are trained for full Churchmanship. In 1905
a Junior Church was formed. Young people
from 10 to 16 years of age, who had given
evidence of having decided for Christ, could
be admitted to membership. They must be
recommended by the Minister, the Sunday
School Superintendent, and one other ?re-
liable membr of the Church,? preferably the
Sunday School teacher. The Church meet-
ing made the decision. A quarterly Com-
munion was held among them, and they
had one Communion a year with the
Church. At 16 years after visitation and
favourable report they would be admitted
to full membership of the Church.
Rev. Joseph Robertson , M.A.
In 1908, Mr. Gloss resigned, having accept-
ed an invitation to become Minister of Trin-
ity Congregational Church, Christ Church,
New Zealand. He was succeeded by Rev.
Joseph Robertson, M.A. Like Mr. Gloss and
the Rev. F. H. Brown, Mr. Robertson was
trained in Camden College, Sydney. He
came to Ipswich from Clayton Church, Ade-
laide. Early in this ministry it was clear
that the old days were going. The indiffer-
ence to religion, felt in the large cities,
had at last found its way to Ipswich. In
1909 a Church Meeting discussed the ?poor
attendance at Church.? Sunday School
figures were also down. Mr. G. H. Shillito
took part in the discussion with some vigour.
He suggested that the Deacons should map
out the seats, each taking some, note who was
absent and visit them during the week. The
Minister said that many of those whose
names were on the seats ?did not attend
once a day, but once in a while.? How fami-
liar it all is to those of us who have lived
the 44 years since 1909.
Kirkheim (Haigslea)
In 1911 the Church at Kirkheim became a
branch of Central. The Church there was a
break away from the Lutheran Church. Its
members had gathered together, put up a
building, and applied to the Congregational
Union for affiliation. This being granted, a
conference was held, and it was agreed that
the new Church become associated with
Central.
The Lull Before the Storm.
It seemed that the days of 1912-13 were
a lull before the storm. Mr. Robertson, a
man of sound scholarship, with Old World
dignity, and a good, simple preacher, went
about his work steadily. It was the kind
of ministry that prepared the people for
the storm that was coming. There was a
steady response. The Annual Report of
March, 1912, showed that the attendances at
Church services were good. The roll stood
at 385, and there was an increase in the


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.

number of Sunday School scholars. When
war broke out in 1914, the diaconate was,
P. A. Whitehead, G. H. Shillito, W. B. Ward,
F. W. Johnson, J. E. J- P. North,
A. E. Payne, and G. H. A sturdy band,
who knew what they stood for, and stood
firmly. The men began to move away on
war service. The Honour Roll in the Church
tells us the names, and beautiful windows
commemorate them. It was a sad time for
family life. Mr. and Mrs. Robertson were
a tower of strength, and themselves knew
the fellowship of loss and suffering.
Youth Classes.
A feature of the life of the Church at this
time was the Young Men?s Class conducted
by Mr. J. E. Walker. Forty-five of the
class had gone to the war, and, yet, in 1917,
there was an average attendance of 25. The
Anthenium Gynasium class was also a fea-
ture of youthful activity. In the 1917 report
we find that there were 42 men in the class
and 38 had their names on the Honour
Board. And we are not unmindful of the
Girl?s Class in physical culture. Central has
never lost sight of the discussion that
sharpens the mind, and the exercise that
keeps the body fit.
Good Year Despite War.
Despite the blows of the war, the 1917
report shows good work and encouraging re-
sults. Mr. Joseph Hargreaves, Sunday School
Superintendent, reported that there were
400 on the roll, and Mr. J. P. North, Church
Treasurer, was able to report that, with a
large number of men away, the income for
the year was �1124. The old Church was
weathering the storm well. For part of this
year the Church had no pastor, as Rev.
Joseph Robertson resigned in April, 1916.
During the period without a minister, the
Church was very ably led by Mr. W: Tat-
ham and Mr. G. H. Shillito, the Senior
Deacons.
Rev. A. H. and Mrs. Austin.
In October, 1917, Rev. A. H. Austin, M.A.,
became minister. The new minister was a
South Australian, trained at Camden Col-
lege, Sydney, and came to Ipswich after a
period as Chaplan of the Forces. He was
soon facing the tasks of the ministry in
those closing months of the war. He was
very ably supported by his wife, a lady
who was already one of the leaders of Con-
gregational women throughout the Common-
wealth.
Vigorous Leadership.
The influence of the new minister and
his wife was soon felt. The Sunday School
had a good year, the numbers exceeding
400. To the already long list of organisa-
tions gathering together as members re-
turned from service, was added a Girl?s
Guild. Mrs. Austin was the life and leader
of this new movement. Her experience as a
leader of young women in southern cities
made her an ideal leader. The Women?s
Guild began to turn from the tasks of women
in wartime, and face the opportunities for
service in the Church.
The First Motor Car.
In July, 1919, it was decided to purchase
a motor car for the us� of the minister. For
many years the minister had travelled
around the district in a horse drawn vehicle
or on horse back. W� think of all the miles
travelled in the years. Early ministers had
ridden as far west as Drayton and Too-
woomba. One is reported to have gone as
far as Roma, another rode to Warwick. On
all roads and in all weathers the ministers
of Central visited their flock, and sought
new opportunities for service. Now the horse
was to go and the car do the work. In the
first fifty years of the life of the Church
women seem seldom to have spoken or even
moved resolutions in Church Meetings. They
would appear to have been following the
injunction of St. Paul to keep quiet in the
Church Meeting. But that day had gone
long before 1919, and it was Miss Page and
Miss Mossom who moved and seconded the
resolution regarding the motor car. These
two women were in those days doing excel-
lent work in the Church. Miss Page with her
love of the Church and enthusiasm for the
London Missionary Society, and Miss
Mossom in the Christian Endeavour with its
ideal of Christ and the Church.
New Officers.
Mr. G. H. Shillito had long been seeking
relief from the work of Secretary of the
Church. He was succeeded in 1920 by Mr. A.
E. Payne. And in 1921, Mr. J. P. North,
after faithful service for some years, resigned
from the treasurership. He was succeeded
by Mr. A. H. Whitehead. It was soon evident


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.
Page Ten
that Mr. Payne and Mr. Whitehead made a
strong team and they set to work with a
will. At this time the Church suffered a loss
in the death of Mr. F. A. Johnson, who had
a long record of faithful service as deacon,
and the removal of Mr. and Mrs. J. Rees.
Mr.' Rees had served in the Sunday School
and Choir most effectively.
W. Tatham.
Mr. W. Tatham, after long and faithful
service to the Church and the community,
passed away in June, 1921. The Church
was only 17 years old. when Mr. Tatham,
then 27 years of age, became a member.
For 51 years he worshipped and served in
the Church* As a deacon and a Church
officer he was capable and loyal. In 1895
Mr. Tatham served the denomination as
President of the Union. When the Church
was without a minister he often presided
at Church Meetings, and his familiar signa-
ture can be found on many a faded record
of the minute books. Mr. Austin in a
moving tribute to him, said. ?He went to
the tasks which still awaited the faithful
co-workers with God.??
Branch Churches and
Self-support.
The matter of urging the Branch Churches
to do their best to become self-supporting
arose at time. In presenting his
report in 1922, the Treasurer, Mr. A. H.
Whitehead, said that the Branch Churches
had received � 180 from Central in that year.
He urged that they be asked to 1 face up to
the responsibility of becoming self-supporting
as early as possible. This discussion was to
continue through the years until all the
Churches stood upon their own feet. There
came a time when they were all supporting
themselves. Then some had to come back
again for help. It was not until the present
pastorate, in 1949, when Rev. S. J. Judd be-
came pastor of the Eastern Suburbs Group,
that it could be said that all were managing
their own affairs independently of the parent
Church. Since that time the first child of
Central, West Ipswich, has come back under
the wing of the mother Church, but no
monetary help is given.
Steady Progress.
In 1923-24 there was steady progress. The
consecrated leadership of Mr. Nichol in the
Sunday School, supported by a loyal staff
and a minister and his wife who were en-
thusiasts in children?s work, was having its
effect. There were also some building pro-
jects that at the time were interesting the
people. It was decided to finance the build-
ing of a hall on the corner opposite the
Sunday School from the new Church Fund.
This hall was to be used by the young
people of the Church, and the Guides and
Scouts. It served a very useful purpose for
some years. There was progress out at
Raceview, and Central was asked to arrange
an overdraft with the bank for the Church
there, so that a larger Church could be
built. Central responded and help was
given in the new project. It was at this
time, 1924, that the name of Mr. W. E. Har-
greaves first appears as a Secretary. Mr.
A. H. Whitehead continued as Treasurer.
designation of Minister.
In September, 1924, Rev. A. H. Austin re-
signed the pastorate. He and Mrs. Austin
had decided to take a long holiday abroad.
This very able couple had made a keen
impact upon the life of the Church, and all
learnt of the resignation with great regret.
Mr. Austin had been very interested in the
movement to place windows the Church
in memory of those who served and fell in
the war of 1914-18. It was very fitting that
he was able to unveil them on 23rd Nov-
ember, 1924. These beautiful windows
might well remind us, not only of the gallant
men and women who went forth from the
Church, but also of Mr. and Mrs. Austin,
who were so intimately associated with them,
and were to pass away themselves in a few
years.
Rev. F. V. Dowling.
The Church was without a minister until
May, 1925, when Rev. F. V. Dowling, M.A.,
was welcomed as the new minister. Like
so many of the Central ministers, Mr. Dowl-
ing was a Camden College man, and he
came to Ipswich from Davey Street,
Hobart, Tasmania. He and Mrs. Dowl-
ling were given a warm welcome. The
Church had wanted them some years before
but they were unable to come. At last they
are in Ipswich.
They Won All Hearts.
More than most ministers Mr. Dowling
found his way into the hearts of people. To
enter a dirty French billet in wartime, grip


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1553-1953.

the outstretched hand, look up into the
gaunt face with the kindly eyes, was an up-
lift. To see him swing the car around a
sharp corner when his mind was elsewhere,
or to sit at an Assembly table and help him
decipher his own writing, was to know how
human he was. And to watch and hear him
preach, the arms moving and the old gown
flapping, was to know that the line of the
prophets was still alive. He was loyally sup-
ported by Mrs. Dowling and her devoted
sister, Miss McCreary.
Home Missionary Spirit.
The years 1926-7, were satisfactory years.
Church Meeting records reveal that more
visitors and strangers were coming to the
Church services and this gave the minister
and people great satisfaction, then as now,
it was felt that new blood would help. As
only Amberley was then receiving any help
from Central, the members, knowing that
helping the other Churches had been good
for the mother Church, began to ask if
there was any new project that should be
supported. Mrs. Spence, who in Sunday
School and Church was such a help in those
days, was particularly insistent in this
matter. And it is worthy of note that while
looking abroad like this the condition of the
Church Roll was giving some concern
Strong efforts were made to revise the roll
and make it effective and a true reflection
of the membership. Excellent work had
been done in this regard over the years
by the Roll Keeper, Mr. W. B. Ward.
Church finance was also healthy. The
Treasurer. Mr. A. H. Whitehead, was able
to report that the overdraft which had
stood for some years had at last been over-
come. The duplex envelope system which
had been introduced at that time was prov-
ing effective, and special efforts by the
Women?s Guild and Mr. F. E. Willesden
had helped very much.
Removals and a Secretarial
Holiday.
In 1928, Mr. and Mrs. A. McVey, removed
to Brisbane and were thanked for their
loyal service. Mr. N. E. Hancock also re-
signed in this year and he was thanked for
long and faithful service as a deacon. And
in 1929, Mr. W. E. Hargreaves was granted
leave of absence for three months. At the
time reference was made to his worth and
work which meant so much to the Church.
After a holiday in the East, Mr. Hargreaves
arrived back in time to compile the 77th
Annual report and he is as eloquent as ever,
making special reference the L.M.S. work
he saw while away.
Death of Rev. F. V. Dowling
In April, 1930, Mr. Dowling passed away.
Tributes in the Church records, in the
religious and secular press, and from pul-
pits throughout the Commonwealth, reveal
something of the great ministry of a good
man. ?He was one of the dearest and
ablest of Congregationalists, a pard-like
spirit, beautiful and swift, ?wrote his old
friend, Rev. Ernest Davies.
Rev. H. W. Whyte, M.A.
The Rev. H. W. Whyte, M.A., became
minister in August, 1930. Mr. Whyte was
well-known throughout Australia. He had
served the London Missionary Society in
South India for 22 years and now, after a
short period as a special Commissioner for
the Society in Australia, was prepared to
take up the work of a home pastorate. The
Church was very gratified when Mr. Whyte
accepted the unanimous 'call to the pas-
torate. The Church had always been ?an
L.M.S. Church? and now with a minister
of missionary experience that emphasis
would be more than maintained. Mr. and
Mrs. Whyte, their daughter, and sons soon
became part of the Church family and
friendships began which have lasted ever
since.
Mr. Joseph Hargreaves.
In October, 1930, the memorial font in the
Church was dedicated to the Glory of God
and in memory of the late Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Hargreaves. Mr. Hargreaves did out-
standing work as Sunday School Superin-
tendent for 30 years. He also served as a
deacon. Group after group of teachers and
scholars passed through his hands in the
long years, and they went out into the life
of the community fortified for good by the
Sunday School training, many of them
came to know what they owed to Mr. Har-
greaves. Some became Church members,
workers in the Church organisations and
deacons. In his days Mr. Hargreaves made
the School a great training school for
Christ and the Church It is indeed fitting
that the memorial to him and his wife
should be a Baptismal Pont.

THE MANSE, RODERICK STREET.
Deepening Life.
In the minute book of the time there is
a summary of a devotional talk given by
Mr. Whyte at the last Church Meeting of
1930. Mr. Whyte spoke of the seven churches
recorded in the Book of Revelation. The
writer emphasised the faults that were in
all save one. There were faults in all
churches, and faults in the Central Church,
but there was also much good, and the
speaker spoke of the good work of the year
that was closing. Nevertheless there was
room for improvement, and he urged that
all seek a deepening of the spiritual life.
This call to deepening was echoed again in
the years that were immediately ahead.
Property Changes.
At a special Church Meeting on 24th
June, 1931, it was decided by a large
majority to proceed with building the new
Church near the Sunday School. Nothing
was done for a year. On 24th August, 1932,
it was decided to rescind the resolution re-
garding the new Church, borrow from the
new Church Fund, and thoroughly renovate
the Church property in Brisbane Street. It
was also decided to build a new organ.
This work proceeded. The old central pulpit
was reduced in size and moved to the side
of the Church. The new organ was built by
Messrs. Whitehouse Bros., of Brisbane, to
the specification of the Church Organist,
Mr. P. E. Willesden. The pipes of the old
organ form the swell organ of the new.
Further property changes in those days
were the purchase of a cottage alongside
the Sunday School in Roderick Street for
a manse, and the sale of the Scout Hall at
the corner of East and Roderick Streets.
The Minister and the
Branch Churches.
While the Churches, for so long called
?Branch Churches,? were becoming more
and more independent and self-supporting,


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.
Page Thirteen
the minister of Central was still their guide,
philosopher and friend. His administrative
ability and sound advice helped all of them.
Central noticed with interest the coming of
Rev. H. S. Capern to North Ipswich, and
the settlement of Rev. N. C. Watt at
Rosewood. Towards the end of 1937, Pastor
Puddefoot, who had done such faithful
work in the Eastern Group, resigned.
The Church Slip.
This is the name our people have always
given the weekly order of service and notice
sheet. It is a help to have it every Sunday,
and it certainly saves time. The ministers
have as a rule edited it, but there have
been exceptions. Messrs. W. E. Hargreaves
and A. E. Payne both edited the Slip during
the years. In recent years good work was
done by Mr. E. Wilson Whitehead, who kept
the intimations up to date and the work of
the Church before the people. In these
days Mr. Prank Hoare is doing this with
acceptance. More than one minister has
suggested the word ?Leaflet? would be more
dignified than ?Slip;? but it remains the
?Slip.? More than once, when finance was
not buoyant, it has been suggested that
this publication, which costs �52 a year, be
discontinued. A Church Meeting in Mr.
Whyte?s day discussed the question; but the
?Slip? lives on to the glory of God and the
information of the people.
Missionary Interest.
We have sad that Central was an ?L.M.S.
Church.? This interest was considerably
quickened when two of the young people
volunteered for Missionary Service with the
L.M.S. One was Miss Vivia Hooper, daughter
of one of the deacons, Mr. N. H. Hooper.
Miss Hooper, now Mrs. T. C. Lloyd Anthony
was dedicated in September, 1936, and went
to South India. We are so glad Mrs. An-
thony is with us for the Centenary. The
elder son of the minister, Mr. F. W. Whyte,
also came forward as a candidate in these
years, and after training at Camden Col-
lege, went to North India. In earlier years
Miss Daisy Morgan had gone forth to the
Zenana Mission. These living links with
the mission field have helped the inner life
of the Church. Deputation time is a great
time in Ipswich. For some years a mis-
sionary dinner was held to welcome the
Deputation; in these days we are satisfied
with a meeting and supper.
Retirement of Treasurer.
In 1938, Mr. A. H. Whitehead resigned as
Treasurer. The Church in accepting the
resignation with very great regret, expressed
its keen appreciation of the long and valu-
ab 1 e service rendered by Mr. Whitehead. He
had guided the Church through years which
called for careful and able handling of
funds. In various property changes and
improvements it had been Mr. Whitehead
who handled the financial side of these mat-
ters. Firmly and efficiently he had done
his work. He was succeeded by Mr. A. B.
Cribb, who has held office ever since. Like
Mr. Whitehead, Mr. Cribb follows a father,
who had established a tradition for wise
and faithful service.
Resignation of Rev. W.
Whyte.
In August, 1938, Mr. Whyte resigned, hav-
ing accepted an invitation to join the staff
of the London Missionary Society in Samoa.
In a special minute, the Church expressed
its appreciation of his ministry of eight
years, which had meant so much to the
Church. The good wishes and prayers of
the people went with him and Mrs. Whyte
as they took up work in Samoa.
Beautiful Windows.
Later in the same year (1938) beautiful
windows were placed in the eastern and
western walls of the Church in memory of
the Rev. Joseph and Mrs. Walker, and Mr.
T. B. and Mrs. Cribb. The Church is so glad
to have these beautiful memorials of four
people who had meant so much in the life
of the Church. They were very active in
service when the Church was strong and
growing. Their contribution was of the kind
that lives on long after they have gone to
their reward.
A Long Wait.
The Church was to have a long wait for
a successor to Mr. Whyte. The senior
deacon, Mr. G. H. Shillito, once again firmly
took charge. No one knows better than Mr.
Shillito what a strong lead means in a
Congregational Church without a minister.
So the familiar signature appears once
again for some months?duly recording the
confirmation of minutes. Such leadership
was always available when needed.


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.

World War 11.
The war came and the life of the Church
and the community began to be shaped by
it. Men and women moved off to the ser-
vices. The fear of air raids led the Church
to have the memorial windows taken out
and buried in a safe place. The need for
pastoral oversight was felt, and Rev. W.
Shenton, a retired Methodist minister, was
appointed by the Church to carry out visit-
ing and pastoral work. Mr. Shenton was a
great help to our people at this time. The
difficulties of the Church were increased
when the military authorities took over the
Sunday School property. Sunday School
Alexander Nichol and
J. E. Walker.
The Annual Report presented to the
Church in March, 1940, made reference to
the severe loss suffered by the Church in
the passing of two men who had been
deacons and leaders for many years. Mr.
A. Nichol was Sunday School Superinten-
dent for 19 years, at first in association
with Mr. J. H. Foots, as Assistant Super-
intendent, and then as Superintendent. With
rare consecration Mr. Nichol carried out
his duties. He could be found in his place
in good weather and in bad, in war days,
and in peace, having walked the by no
means short distance from his home at
Harlin Road. Mr. Walker, son of the Rev.
Joseph Walker, played a large part in the
life of the Church for long years. While
all would speak of his work as deacon,
and advisor to the Church in legal and
financial matters, it is as the leader and
teacher of the Young Men?s Class that he
is best known in the annuals of the Church.
Such men are hard to replace. Mr. E.
Wilson Whitehead succeeded Mr. Nichol
in the Sunday School and ably supported
by Mr. A. M. Hooper as secretary, held
the School together in those difficult days,
until the property was returned to the
Church. Mr. Walker?s place on the diacon-
ate was filled by Mr. S. H. Hancock, who
has served in that capacity ever since.
figures dropped, children very unwillingly
walked the extra distance to the Church,
where Sunday School was being held. The
social life of the Church was maintained
with difficulty, and the hospitality offered
by all the city Churches to service personnel
after the evening service, was not possible
for Central Church. Our people in a splen-
did way tried to meet the situation by of-
fering the hospitality of their homes to
service people. Some friendships began in
those days have lasted down to this day.
Rev. W. Clair Palmer.
Rev. W. Clair Palmer began his ministry
in April, 1940. Mr. Palmer came from Surrey
Hills, Melbourne, and was trained at Parkin
College, Adelaide. He broke the run of
Camden trained men; for over forty years
the ministers had been trained in the Syd-
ney College. The need of the difficult days
of war was a preacher who preached an en-
lightened evangelical message, and was so
sensitive to the needs of men and women
that the note of comfort was never missing.
Mr. Palmer brought that kind of message,
and the people soon knew that a man of
God was in their midst.
Branch Church.
The Eastern Group of Churches could still
be described as ?Branch Churches.? Pastor
S. R. Langdon had succeeded Pastor Pudde-
foot. Later Rev. L. Dalziel was to succeed
Mr. Langdon, and he was to be followed
by Pastor C. T. Couchman, who could be
described as the last ?Branch Church pas-
tor.? This means that by the end of Pastor
Couchman?s pastorate?l949?all the chil-
dren of Central were independent.
89th Annual Meeting.
Increase in membership and offering were
the pleasant things reported in the 89th
Annual Report. The Secretary, Mr. W. E.
Hargreaves paid an eloquent tribute to the
minister, and Mr. F. A. Whitehead expressed
what all felt about the fine service the Sec-
retary was rendering. In the year under
review (1941) �320 was given to the fund
to help bombed-out families in England.
The Sunday School, despite the difficulties
of the war years, reported an enrolment of
143, with 23 teachers. The sum of �2l was
collected by the children for the L.M.S.
Ship Fund was the best for twenty years,
and the best in Queensland.
Resignation of Rev. W. Clair
Palmer.
At the February Church Meeting in 1944,
the Church received the resignation of Mr.
Palmer. It was with great regret the Church
accepted the resignation. Mr. Palmer had
accepted an invitation to become minister
of the Burwood Church in N.S.W.. At the
Annual Meeting in March, the Church Sec-
retary in his report expressed the keen re-


ONE HUNDRED YEARS, 1853-1953.
Page Fifteen
gret of the members and wished Mr. and
Mrs. Palmer and family well in, their new
work. In this same report an increase of
members was reported, and matters regard-
ing the renovation of the Sunday School,
but recently evacuated by the military au-
thorities, were discussed. The Church was
to be without a pastor until October, 1945.
The senior deacon, Mr. G. H. Shillito, once
again took charge and it was arranged for
Pastor C. C. Seymour, of North Ipswich, to
do any necessary visitation.
The Passing of Mr W. E.
Hargreaves.
The Church plunged in sorrow at
this time by the death of the Secretary,
Mr. W. E. Hargreaves. For 21 years he
had served the Church as Secretary. Mr.
Palmer has described him as a ?gracious
Christian gentleman.? No one in the long
history of the Church has been loved more
than Mr. Hargreaves. He was rn ef-
ficient secretary, who had the confidence
of all. His Annual Reports are documents
that bear witness to his knowledge of
Church work, and his firm grasp of world
affairs, and they are always in the language
of one who knew his mother tongue and
how to use it.
One of His Last Letters.
One of the last letters Mr. Hargreaves
wrote was that which extended the invita-
tion of the Church to Rev. J. Harold King,
of Brown Street, Newcastle, N.S. Wales, to
become minister. He did not live to meet
the new minister. The letter was couched in
terms which made plain that the writer
understood the traditional Congregational
ideal of the Call and that in him the minis-
ter would have a good friend. Rev. J. Harold
King began his ministry on Sunday, 15th
October, 194$f-* Dr. H. D. Foote, who for
some time had been minute secretary, suc-
ceeded Hr. Hargreaves as Secretary, and Mr.
S. K. Hooper became minute secretary. The
new Secretary, in association with the
Treasurer, carried out the arrangements for
the settlement of Mr. King and his family.
They have both remained in office through-
out the eight years of the present ministry,
and have been a very great help to the
minister, and have served the Church
loyally.
REV. J. HAROLD KING
Youth Work.
At the beginning of 1945, the youth work
of the Church was being done by the Inter-
mediate Christian Endeavour, led by Mr.
S. K. Hooper and by a Games Club led by
Mr. A. M. Hooper. The new minister had
been closely associated with youth work in
New South Wales and suggested that a
branch of the Congregational Youth Fellow-
ship be formed. This was done in February
of that year, and was greatly helped by the
very willing co-operation of the Intermediate
Endeavour, which carried on the spiritual
side of the youth work leaving the social
work to the C.Y.F. The C.Y.F. is an attempt
to provide a balanced programme for youth
which will preserve the spiritual emphasis
of the C.E. and at the same time throw the

net a little wider and provide social life and
recreation. The movement has continued
through the years and is now an integral
part of the Church.
The War Ends.
At last the weary war years came to a
close. A great service of thanksgiving was
held in the Church on the evening of May
9, 1945. And the Church was associated with
the great united services that were held in
the city at the time. It was a time of great
gladness and yet there was also the note of
sadness. Some were not to come back. We
remember those who went from the heart
of our Church life, Dudley Hooper, Murray
Hancock, and Robert Brodie, and did not
return. We will remember them.
Welcome Home.
As men and women returned from service
with the forces the Church welcomed them.
The authorities sent to ministers the
information regarding discharge from the
forces, and all were welcomed. Many resumed
their old places in the life of the Church
and the community. Others went further
afield for a new start. A special minute was
inserted in the Church records regarding the
cessation of hostilities.
Features of 1946,
The year 1946 was a good one in the life
of the Church. Congregations were well
maintained, the Sunday School was gradu-
ally gathering the children after the hard
years away from the Sunday School building.
The C.Y.F. presented their first religious
pageant, ?Light Triumphant,? under the
direction of Mrs. C. A. Foggon. A new stage
was built upon the large platform in the
hall. Mr. W. R. North, always so helpful in
such property matters, planned this im-
provement. The Church began at this time
to send food parcels to Great Britain. The
money to do this was raised by both direct
giving and special effort. Some of these
parcels were sent to Rev. W. H. Watson,
minister of Tackett Street Congregational
Church, Ipswich, Suffolk. Mr. Watson
kindly distributed them among his people.
Letters passed between the Churches and it
has been a helpful fellowship in the life of
Central Later we were able to send a per-
sonal greeting to Tackett Street when Mr.
A. H. Whitehead visited England.
Merging of C.E. and C.Y.F.
In 1946, Mr. S. K. Hooper, who had led
the Intermediate Christian Endeavour for
some years, went to the country. The minis-
ter carried on the Intermediate for a while,
but as the year ended it seemed best to
merge the C.E. and C.Y.F. The same young
people were in both organisations and while
there was some regret at the passing of
the C.E., the merger has worked well. The
kindly services carried out each year by C.E.
members at the hospital have been main-
tained by the C.Y.F. The Junior C.E. con-
tinued for a time under the leadership of
Mr. W. G. Little and Mr. Graham Yarrow,
but when the Sunday School changed from
afternoon to morning, the meetings were
discontinued.
Guild Jubilee.
In the earlier years it was the custom
to appoint a committee of ladies when the
men felt the task being faced was one a
woman could do better than a man. But
in 1900, under the leadership of Mrs. Closs
a definite organisation was formed, and
became known as the Women?s Guild. Two
of the fundation members, Mrs. Perkins
and Mrs. Merritt, are still with us. The
Jubilee in 1950 was celebrated by a birth-
day luncheon on 27th July at which Prin-
cipal G. L. Lockley, of Cromwell College,
was the speaker. On the following Sunday
special reference was made at the morn-
ing service, and the evening service was
conducted by the Guild. The Guild mem-
bers joined the ladies of the choir and led
the singing, and the sermon was preached
by the President, Mrs. J. H. King. Mrs.
Chalmers, Mrs. Foggon and Miss Perkins
assisted in the lessons and prayer.
A succession of capable and conse-
crated officers has made possible a notable
service for 50 years. We think of the late
Mrs. V. W. Martin and the present officers,
Mrs. H. D. Foote (Secretary) and Mrs. A. B.
Cribb (Treasurer). The L.M.S. and Home
Mission Auxiliary work has been kept be-
fore our people by such good workers
as Mrs. W- E. Hargreaves, Miss F. Perkins,
and Miss B. Tongue. And we remember
what Vice-President Mrs. G. H. Shillito has
done as Press agent and Harvest Thanks-
giving enthusiast. Then there is a quiet
group in the background led by Mrs. P.
G. Woolley, which has helped so much
by capable management of social matters.

Jubilee of Sunday School Building.
The Sunday School had been in the pre-
sent building for 50 years in 1945. This
was celebrated in an unusual way, instead
of adding something to the build-
ing, as at the 25th anniversary in 1920,
when windows were put in the eastern end,
the scholars were challenged to raise at least
�5O for the ?John Williams.? The Superin-
tendent, Mr. E. Wilson Whitehead, gave a
fine lead, and the girls and boys respondede
well. When the cards were called in it was
found that �BO had been collected. A really
good piece of work.
Sunday School Changes .
In 1949, Mr. Whitehead resigned as Super-
intendent of the Sunday School. It was
with great regret his resignation was
accepted and in no uncertain way scholars,
teachers, and Church expressed appreciation
of his nine years? service. He was succeeded
by Mr. F. A. Capern. Unfortunately, the
period Mr. Capern served was all too short.
He became seriously ill and eventually was
compelled to give up the work and to the
sorrow of all passed away soon after. His
service was brief but of excellent quality.
It was in his days that the school changed
the time of meeting from afternoon to
morning. Fortunately for the Church and
Sunday School, Mr. S. K. Hooper had come
back from his sojourn in the West, and
agreed to act as Superintendent. Later he
accepted the full office and has carried on
ever since in the keen and efficient manner
which has marked all his service through
the years. The steady and faithful work
of Mr. F. F. Capern as Secretary through all
the changes has been a great help.

Sad Losses.
The Church suffered some sad losses in
the closing years of the century. First Mr.
A. E. Payne passed away. As Deacon and
Secretary he had done good work for the
Church and was greatly missed. Another
loss was the death of Mr, H. C. Frost. As
Sunday School teacher. Deacon, and prop-
erty steward, Mr. Frost had been very faith-
ful over a number of years. And Mr. John
Grey was another who was called away in
those years. In the Endeavour movement
and in the L.M.S., at one time as secretary
of the local auxiliary, and also as literature
secretry, the late Mr. John Grey did his
quiet work in his own way. No one has
quite filled his place in the life of the
Church.
Songs of the Sanctuary.
The Church has been well served by those
who have been organists and choristers.
We have no record of some of the early lead-
ers of praise. A member of the Challinor
played the first harmonium for a time.
Then we had a Mr. Bennett and latei &
Mr. Richmond. For some years a blind
organist, Mr. Strahan, assisted by his wife,
had charge. When we come to Mr. Sydney
May in 1905, we are on surer ground. Some
can remember those days when, under Mr.
May?s leadership, good work was done. And
all know of what Central people have come
to call ?Messiah services,? organised and
conducted by Mr. F. E. Willesden,
L.R.S.M., ably assisted by the Choir secretary,
Miss J. B. Ward. These services in each De-
cember made an inspiring hour. In Sep-
tember, 1952, Mr. Willesden resigned after
31 years? able service to the Church. The
Church accepted the resignation with re-
gret and thanked him for his long and able
service. This position has not yet been fill-
ed. The Deputy Organist, Miss Eva Tongue,
is carrying on and assisting Mr. Sydney
May, who has come back for the Centenary.
The Church has always been well served by
the Deputy Organists; we think of the long
years Miss Ena Trevaskes so willingly did
the work when the Church was looking for
an Organist. Choirs are made possible by
able leadership, but also by faithful mem-
bers. The Church owes very much to those
who, year in and year out, attend the practices
and are always in their place on Sundays.
Now, as during past years, the Church has
a band of such valuable people.
Sunday School Anniversary
Changes.
The Sunday School Anniversary, such a
feature in the life of the Church, began to
change in the period 1945-1950. The old
custom of mass singing by three hundred
children, assisted by an orchestra, is not so
effective when you have about a hun-
dred children. The old style singing had
been well led by able men in the past; we
think at once of Mr. J. Rees and Mr. J.
Tunstall. When the present ministry be-
gan, Mr. A. M. Hooper was leading the sing-
ing in his enthusiastic way. He also greatly
he ped in the transition period when a new
method was being tried. For several years
teachers and scholars presented dramas
with a definite message. The School was
assisted in this work by Mrs. C. A. Foggon,
who gave of her time and talent so will-
ingly. The tendency to-day (1953) is to go
back to choral work alone. As the number
of scholars is increasing almost weekly, that
type of Anniversary may become more effec-
tive.
Church Membership.
When the Centenary year opened there
were approximately 200 on the Church Roll.
An attendance of 100 at Communion would
be deemed good, and it has not been reached
The Line of Preachers.
The work of the years would not have
been possible without preachers. We are
net thinking of the ministers, but of the
lay preachers, and those who from their
ranks found their way into the full-time
ministry. From the membership of
Central Church, Revs. S. F. Whitehead,
Frederick North, M.A., Robert W. Mossom,
M.A., 8.D., and Alfred G Finch, 8.A.,
L.Th., went into the ministry; and John
B. Cribb is in College preparing for ord-
ination. The story of the old Preacher?s
Class is a great one. They met regularly,
had lectures, and took charge of the dis-
trict, preaching every Sunday. Away they
went every Sunday morning, west and east,
north and south, to preach the Gospel. It
is a continuation of the story of those who
from Jerusalem went north to Antioch in
Syria, and eventually burst into the western
world with the evangel in their hearts and
upon their lips.
very often in recent years. The position is
much the same as when Mr. King came to
Ipswich. Members are gathered in each
year, but losses are sustained by death, re-

moval, and by what our father called back-
sliding.. The Roll is an amazing record,
and it has been kept very faithfully for a
hundred years. In the early years of the
century we can trace the hands of Samuel
Welsby and S. F. Whitehead in it, and in
more recent years W. B. Ward, N. H.
Hooper, A. E. Payne and J. Finch have
maintained the tradition.
In the Life of the
Denomination.
The Church has always been a real force
in the life of the denomination. Three of
the ministers have held the highest office
that Congregationalism can bestow upon its
sons, that of President of the Congregational
Union of Australia and New Zealand. Rev.
W. J. L. Gloss, 8.A., held office some years
after he left Ipswich, Rev. F. V. Dowling,
M.A., was in office when he left Hobart to
come to Ipswich, and the present minister
completed his term of office in May of last
year. Thirteen of the sixteen ministers have
been Presidents of the Queensland Con-
gregational Union, and three of the laymen,
Messrs. W. Tatham, T. B. Cribb, and G. H.
Shillito have also occupied that position. In
the Executive and Committee work of the
Union our men and women have always
taken a worthy part, and continue to do so.
Mr. S. K. Hooper is Chairman of the Young
People?s Department of the Union and a
member of the Executive. Mr. A. B. Cribb
serves in the Executive, and Messrs. V. E.
Hancock, H: J. Walker and Dr. A. G. Wilson
are Governors of Cromwell College.
In the Community *
Members of the Church have witnessed in
the life of the Community. Eight of them
have been members of the Queensland Par-
liament, one of them was a member of the
old New South Wales Assembly before
Queensland became a separate colony. Seven
have been Mayors of Ipswich, and a much
larger number served as Aldermen. And
in every walk of life as well as in the quiet
life of the home, they have been found
bearing their witness.
Tokens of Tribute.
It has long been a happy and beautiful
custom to place in our churches memorials
to those who served in their way and gen-
eration. This custom ha sbeen followed in
Central Church. We have already refei?red
to some of the stained glass windows and
the Baptismal Font. The cedar chairs
behind the Communion Table are always
before us and each has an appropriate in-
scription. The simple mural tablet to the
memory of Mrs. Spence. The desk light in
the pulpit in memory of Mr. Berry. Then
as we enter the Church we see the window
with the cross, in the screen, in memory of
Mr. Eric Hargreaves. It is indeed fitting
that the memorial to Mr. W. E. Hargreaves
should be the floor in the front porch, where
he so often stood to welcome people as they
came up the steps. The deaf-aids placed in
the Church in memory of Mr. and Mrs. F.
A. Whitehead, who were such a force in
the life of the Church for years, are among
our most useful gifts. The last addition
was the very beautiful window in memory of
Miss Estelle Cribb, who so quietly and
graciously worshipped and served in our
midst.
The Nfimes.
We do not altogether agree with Thomas
Carlyle thkt history is the story of great
men. But history cannot be written without
mentioning names. In the story of a Church
(limited to 10,000 words) which has received
1741 members in the hundred years, all
names can?t be mentioned. The attempt has
been made to tell the significant names, but
no one is more aware than the writer that
in all such stories there are the quiet, unseen
ministries of those whose names have not
found their way into any record. We thank
God for them.
' It is of God.
Far be it from us to boast. The fathers
would be the first to rebuke us. All
human effort is touched with human im-
perfection. ?We have erred and strayed
from Thy ways, O Lord,? or again, ?Unto
God be the glory.? But this is more than
a human story. It is a record of God
manifesting Himself in a body of imperfect
men and women. We have written of the
Church, the Body of Christ. It is a great
story of His grace and power. Having paid
our tribute and given thanks unto God,
there remains for us the opportunity of the
present and the call of the future. BACK
TO YOUR BANNERS, CENTRAL. TAKE UP
THE TASKS THAT AWAIT YOU. BUILD
THE KINGDOM WHICH HAS NO FRON-
TIERS, BUT IS IN HUMAN HEARTS AND
O?ER THE BROAD EARTH AND IS WORLD
WITHOUT END. ?HIS TOUCH HATH
STILL ITS ANCIENT POWER.?
AMEN.

Postscript,
The last word of this brief record was
typed ready for the printer on Monday
morning, 16th February, 1953. A few hours
later, about 5 p.m., a disastrous fire broke
out in the Church. The organ was destroyed
and extensive damage done to the build-
ing. The Church Meeting on Wednesday
evening, 18th February decided not to re-
novate the old building, but to proceed
with plans for a new 'Church building
alongside the Sunday School on the corner
of East and Roderick Streets.
WE SHALL ARISE AND BUILD.
Acknowledgement
The Centenary Committee is indebted to
our minister for compiling this history, in-
volving many hours of painstaking search
of records and minute books of the last
hundred years. We know his problem of
what to leave out was as great as what to
include. The Committee feels it would be
lacking in gratitude if the author?s name
were lost in anonymity, or if he glossed
over his own notable eight years? contri-
bution to this Church and the denomina-
tion.
