THE AGE OF THE HORSE
To tell the age in his early youth
You will open the mouth to get the truth,
At one year old as will be seen
A full milk-set all white and clean;
There is no doubt, and you can bet
It’s a thousand to one, on a spanking set.
At two years it is our belief
There’s little difference in the teeth;
But of course we will admit
They might have grown a little bit;
For a surer sign you can depend
You’ll find it at the other end.
The foalv curls as we’ll go bail
Have disappeared from the youngster’s tail
At three years you must return
To the mouth again where you ’ll discern
That two Horse-teeth have come to stay
It is the old and regular way.
At four years another pair
Have come along to do their share;
At five years old. all in his prime
Composed by D. N. MARTIN, CLARE.
A full horse-set is there on time;
With recesses in each tooth
They are there to give you proof.
At six years from the middle two
These cavities have passed from view;
At seven years as w r e’ve heard tell
The second pair have lost their ‘ ‘ well ’ ’
At eight years as sure as you’re born
You’ll find the last two cavities gone.
At nine a dark speck may remain
At ten its usually gone again;
From then on till twenty-one
Telling the age is mostly fun;
After that as we’ve been told
Dobbin is considered “getting old”.
He may do his work blithely and gay
But make hard work on rough coarse hay
He may toil along good and even
But at any time may ‘ ‘ throw a seven ’ ’
A handy old horse as a gee-gee goes
But one of these days he must “turn up
his toes.”
