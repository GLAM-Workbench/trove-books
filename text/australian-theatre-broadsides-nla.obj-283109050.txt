A doctor is a useful man,
Who does us all the good he can.
But BE. WAUGH now takes the cake,

Would you know the reason why

Then just his BAKING PO#DSR Jpy.
► And put it to the test.
With it a girl can make a oak%
‘ As light as any feather ;
But if she seme other take,
► ’Twill turn out jus* l&e leather.
So let us all unite

Whoso Baking Powder, of which we write,
► Is now a household law.

Many cooks know all about it;
And these are never found without it;
“ WABOH’S,” they say, is “ best or ALL,”
And never do they’ for other call.

Then just his Baking Powder buy,
And pu t it to the test.
-With it a girl oan make a cake
As light as any feather ;
But if she some other take,
’Twill turn out just like leather
Whosoever with it makes
Pies, or tarts, or scones, or cakes.
If used it is with proper care, „
Results will be as light as air.
And delighted guests will raise
Their vdioes in unmeasured praise.
Good housewives so will surely never
From Waugh's Baking Powder sever.
Though Holloway may cure with Pills,
And Davis kill the pain;
«Dr. Waugh prevents your Ills,
his Powder, pure and plain.
If as years do onwards run,
You would indigestion shun,
Try the Doctor’s great invention ;
“ Better than core is prevention.”
This Powder in question cures indigestion ;
Is preventive of sickness and ills;
Be advised then, and get it ; you’ll never

And you’ll never want anyone’s pills.

A Well-known Sydney Resident Cured of
Rheumatism-
Mr. PEGG will only be too pleased to give any sufferer fuller
detail’s of his case by calling at his private address as below:—
47 Lower Fort-street, Dawes Point.
Sydney, Nov. 30th, 1899.
Mr. S, A, Palmer, 184 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Dear Sir. — lam glad to testify to the invaluable qualities of
Yitadatio. Some thirteen month ago I had to consult a Melbourne
doctor re a severe attack of Rheumatism. The doctor perscribed
for me, but medicine gave me no permanent relief. I suffered
aoute pain for months, and was unable to sleep for more than an
hour oi two during the night. Knowing several of your clients
who had been cured by Yitadatio I resolved to give it a trial, and
am happy to say that for the last three months I have been perfectly
free from pain, and have no hesitation in attributing my restored
health to Yitadatio. I shall be very glad to give personal cor-
roboration to the above if necessary.
Yonrs faithfully,

Mr. S. A. Palmer, Agent for Yitadatio.
Dear Sir,-—1 write to let you know of the great benefit I have de-
rived since taking Webber’s Yitadatio. About ten years ago, my
health broke down. I suffered with Bilious Attacks, Headaches,
Constipation, and Flatulence. I consulted doctors (the best in
Melbourne) and they said that my kidneys and liver were out of
order, and that was the cause of all my trouble. They treated me
for that complaint but I only derived temporary benefit- I soon be-
came worse and life was a burden to me. I tried a great many of the
advertised medicines for liver and kidney diseases but got no better
I had read so much about Yitadatio that I though I would give it a
trial, and to my surprise after taking six large bottles, my trouble
turned out to be Hydatids, I continued with the medicine and am
now quite cured. I have the Hydatids preserved in spirits. lam
thankful to get rid of such a terrible disease and I am so well now
that I give you this testimonial, so that any one suffering similarly
to what I was, might try Yitadatio. I will be glad to tell anyone
about my case and shew them the Hydatids if they will call, or will
write. Fuller particulars to anyone wishing to know more of my
case if they will enclose a stamped addressed envelope for reply.

them in an unpleasant way : “What do you

horribly at a hatchet-faced young man who

answered the witness, hastily diving into his
