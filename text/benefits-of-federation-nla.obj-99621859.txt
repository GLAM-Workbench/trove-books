BENEFITS OF FEDERATION
I. To promote the prosperity of Australia in general and South Australia in particular.
Without Federation South Australia never can become great or populous. She is
now stationary and depressed.
2. To secure more abundant and permanent Employment to the Workers.
3. To give better opportunities to our Children to make Homes for themselves without
sending them out of South Australia.
4, To give Cheaper Food and Clothing.
5. To develop the Resources, Trade, and Manufactures of South Australia.
6. To encourage the expenditure of Capital to stock and develop our abandoned
Pastoral Country.
7. To make yourself a Citizen of an Australian Nation—one flag and one people.
8, To create United Australia.
9. Our share of the expense of Federation cannot exceed £33,000; but against that we
shall have extra Railway Revenue (£lO,OOO per annum). Savings—Agent
General’s Office, reduction of cost of Local Parliament, Ministers, Government
House, and others. Besides, there will be a direct gain of at least £40,000 per
annum by Federalising the South Australian Debt. Federation will, therefore, cost
South Australia nothing.
10. The terms now offered are specially favorable to South Australia. If we reject them we
shall never again get terms so favorable to the smaller Colonies-
11. If the larger Colonies Federate without us, we shall be powerless against such a
combination which may ruin our trade and manufactures and diminish our revenue,
and we shall ultimately be forced to join them on almost any terms they choose
to dictate.
