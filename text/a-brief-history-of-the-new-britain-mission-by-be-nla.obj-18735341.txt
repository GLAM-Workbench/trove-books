NEW BRITAIN.
# Initial Steps.
3 New Britain Mission was established
in response to a conviction on the part
’of Australasian Methodism that the
time had come to push out into the
“ regions beyond,” seeing God had so
richly blessed its efforts in Tonga,
Samoa, Eotuma and Fiji. With this
conviction, God gave the man for the
work, in the Rev. George Brown,
now known as Dr. Brown, and, for
the past fourteen years, General Secretary of the Society.
On Wednesday, September 9th, 1874, a meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Board of Missions was held, the
President of the New South Wales Conference being in' the
chair, surrounded by such men as Revs. James Watkin,
George Hurst, Benjamin Chapman (Secretary of the Society),
Joseph Oram, Walter J. Davis, Francis Tait and James A. Nolan,
who placed the question of a new Mission before the Church in
the following manner :
“ For many years our existing Missions have entailed
responsibilities quite as heavy as our Church has been able to
bear. We believe, however, that our circumstances are now
altered for the better. It is certain that our largest and most
expensive Mission, that in Fiji, will need the efficient aid of the
Society for years to come Whose past history has
been so glorious, and, if it should still require support from the
Society, it is able and willing, nay desirous, to give substantial
help in the establishment of a new Misssion. In the form of
Native Ministers and Teachers, Fiji will aid us efficiently in
carrying the Gospel to the ‘ regions beyond.’


“ But though the case is thus with Fiji, it is, as might be
expected, far otherwise with the older Mission in Tonga. So
great has been the success with which the Lord has blessed the
labours of his servants there, that, instead of taxing the resources
of the Society, Tonga has become a contributor to its Funds.
Under these circumstances, many of our friends and supporters
have been anxiously desiring and praying for some new
Providential opening. At this juncture the attention of the
Executive Committee of Missions has been directed to New
Britain, New Ireland, and other islands off the coast of New
Ihe Rev. B. CHAPMAN,
General Secretary, 1873—1881.
Guinea The Committee, after a careful considera-
tion, has approved of the proposal, that the John Wesley do on her
Mission voyage pay a visit of inquiry to the Islands of New
Britain and New Ireland. It is intended that a Deputation shall
proceed with her, who shall take with him a number of Native
Ministers from Fiji, Samoa, and perhaps Tonga; and that he
shall visit the most influential chiefs of those Islands, who may
be accessible, and shall endeavour to settle Native Ministers and
Teachers in the most suitable towns.”


“ The above is but a general idea of the Committee’s
proposal; the details are yet to be carefully considered and
settled. We earnestly and confidently invite the prayers and
sympathy of our Church in behalf of this undertaking, that we
may be favoured with the Divine guidance and blessing as our
fathers were.”
New Britain—Discovery and History.
Captain William Cornelison Shouten was the first to give
the World any very definite information about the New Britain
Archipelago. On the 2oth of June, 1617, he sailed down the
east coast of New Ireland, and came into collision with the
Natives, several being killed and some being taken prisoners. One
of the latter was so badly wounded, that, on the payment of
ten hogs, he was set free, concerning whom Shouten says ;
“ Undoubtedly that was the full value of him,”
In 1642, Abel Tasman, after sailing round Australia, and
so proving it to be an Island, returned home by way of New
Britain, but adds nothing to our knowledge of the place.
In 1699, that great English navigator, Sir William
Dampier, had a large and somewhat rough experience of
the group. On the east coast of New Ireland he was fiercely
attacked by 300 or 400 natives in canoes, who were armed with
slings, and he deemed it prudent to put out to sea. He named
that place, “ Slingers’ Bay.” Rounding and naming Cape
St. George, he proceeded into what seemed to him a large gulf,
at the bead of which an active volcano was sending forth vast
columns of smoke. Continuing in a westerly direction he
coasted along the shores of New Britain, and, rounding the
southern end of that Island, he sailed northward through the
passage, which he named after himself, Dampier Straits, and
called the land, now proved to be an island, Nova Britannia
In 1722 Jacob Roggewein called at the group, but gives no
additional information concerning the islands.
In 1766, Captain Carteret in* H.M. Sloop Swallow, upon
passing Cape St. George, was driven by a strong N.W. current
into what was supposed by Dampier to be a large gulf. On
Friday, August 28th of that year, he anchored' under an island,
to which he gave the name of Wallis Island, and at English
Cove discovered signs of recent habitation. He took possession
of this, and the adjacent islands, in the name of King George,
and then, standing out into the supposed “ Bay,” was driven
by strong wind and current northward, and discovered, not a
deep “ Bay,” but a wide deep channel, which he named St.
George’s Channel,, and the newly discovered island he called
Nova Hibernia. Then in passing he christened the Duke of


York group and the more prominent parts of the east coast of
New Britain.
In 1768 Louis de Bougainville followed the same course as
Carteret. He complains much of the rains, which were incessant
during his stay there. He says“ It seemed upon the whole
that during this season the rains were uninterrupted here. One
tempest comes on before the other has gone off, it thunders
continually, and the nights are fit to convey an idea of chaotic
darkness.”
In 1791 D ’Entrecasteaux arrived at Port Carteret. He
complains of excessive rains, of scorpions and alligators, but
does not appear to have had much or any intercourse with
the natives.
In the same year Captain Hunter, of the sloop Sirius,
dropped anchor in a cove in the Duke of York group on
the 23rd May, and named the beautiful little harbour after
himself. There was a skirmish with the natives resulting
in their defeat. He left there a pair of English pointers.
He also immensely pleased several natives by shaving them. It
was on the north point of this Port Hunter that the first
Mission-house was built.
In July, 1841, Captain Belcher, of the Sulphur, put into
Port Carteret. They found a,native who could speak a little
English, and at once christened him “ Tom Starling.”
Belcher says:—“ The continuance of torrents of rain has
certainly surpassed anything I have before observed in any
other clime.”
Other men-of-war visited the group, but the little
information they yielded is admirably expressed in the following
extract from the Executive Committee’s statement laid before
the Church:—“ We are not able to give much information
concerning the islands, for the simple reason that so little is
known. At a few points some intercourse has been held with
Europeans, and we know of two or three places, in each of
which a solitary trader has resided for a short time; but
they have taken their departure. A single glance at the
chart will show that very little has been done to facilitate
navigation. The large islands are bold and mountainous.
On New Britain there are volcanoes in a state of activity at the
present time. Most of the islands appear to be very fertile,
and to abound in tropical vegetation.”
“We believe that these islands are occupied by people
of the Papuan and the Malay races. As to their moral
condition, we are sure they are not innocent and pure; but
testimony accuses them of cannibalism and cruelty. We
conjecture that they will be found in a state very similar
to that of the inhabitants of Fiji forty years ago. We are

informed that the population is large, the abundance of food,
and the contiguity of these islands to New Guinea leading us
to believe our information is correct. This, then, is our
contemplated field of labour—extensive, populous, and yet
compact. It possesses another recommendation, that, so far
as we are able to ascertain, it has never yet been visited by
any Christian Church; its inhabitants have never yet heard
the glad tidings. We cannot, therefore, be charged with
building upon other men’s foundations.”
Special interest attaches itself to this Mission by reason
of its being the first missionary effort initiated by the
Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church, and also as furnishing
the first opportunity the converts of our older Missions have had
presented to them for proving their faith in God, and zeal for His
service in unknown lands and climes, among savage and.
degraded peoples. As this history proceeds we shall find
that the Methodist Church of these lands has abundant
reason to praise God for the noble men and women who
gladly laid down their lives .in New Britain for their Lord
and Saviour.
The Floating of the mission.
This new Christian enterprise was first publicly advocated
and floated, and so practically born, in Ballarat, Victoria, the
Eev. J. J. Watsford, who was at that time stationed at Sebas-
topol, acting as Secretary to the movement. Little did he then
think that one of his own sisters would occupy no mean place in
the history of the new Mission.
On the 21st September, 1874, Mr. Brown explained and
urged his plan to a large and sympathising assembly in Lydiard-
street Church, and on the following Tuesday and Wednesday did
the same in the Pleasant-street and Barkly-street Churches. It
was then resolved to thoroughly organise the effort, and for that
purpose special meetings were ..held on Sept. 24th in Barkly-
street Church at six o’clock, and again at halLpast seven in
Lydiard-street. James Oddie, Esq., was in the chair at the latter
meeting, when it was decided that the Eevs. Geo. Brown and
F. J. Horsely should draw up for distribution a circular containing
the substance of Mr. Brown’s addresses, and a statement of the
probable cost of the trial trip of the John Wedry to New Britain.
This was done in a masterly manner, the circular being the
product of sound common sense, business acumen, and
Christian faith and confidence.
The Secretary, Mr. Watsford, in enforcing the points of the
circular upon our people, concluded a powerful appeal by saying:
“It is time that we did move. God has breathed the thought.


He has kindled the desire, He has indicated the field of labour,
He is preparing the men; it is for us to supply the means and
take possession of the lands that sit in darkness and in the
shadow of death, waiting for the light of the dayspring from on
high.”
REV. J. J. WATSFORD.
The Mission was taken up with enthusiasm throughout
New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and all the other States,
and of the eleven European missionaries who, up to the present,
have laboured in New Britain, four are Victorians; the re-
mainder came from N.S. Wales, New Zealand, England and
Germany.


En Route.
At the latter end of April, 1875, after much delay, which,
though trying at the time, in the end proved to be for the
furtherance of the Gospel, the Eev. Geo. Brown left Sydney in
the’ John Wesley, bound for New Britain, via Fiji, Samoa and
Rotuma. At each of the two first-named places he hoped to
secure a contingent of native assistants. A short time prior to
the arrival of the vessel in Fiji a fearful epidemic of measles had
consumed one-third of the entire nation by its virulence. On
Tuesday, June Ist, the following generous resolution was passed
by a meeting of missionaries and native ministers :—“ That in
our opinion, Mr. Waterhouse will be justified in placing at the
Rev. Geo. Brown’s disposal such of the students, married or
otherwise, whose superintendents may have given their consent,
and whom he considers to be suitable.” This resolution was
passed at a time when Fiji itself had great need of trained men.
The missionaries in Fiji have never been found wanting in zeal
and self-denial where the extension of Christ’s kingdom is
concerned.
Out of a number of volunteers, six married men and three
single were finally selected, to whom grand old Joeli Bulu gave
sound advice and earnest exhortation! The Government felt
called upon to see that this band of volunteers thoroughly under-
stood the character of the work 40 which they had devoted them-
selves, and for that purpose they were invited to meet the
Administrator on the 12th June. They were questioned closely
by Mr. Layard, and informed by him of the dangers which
awaited them in New Britain. Aminio Bale replied for the
others and himself, saying—
“ We have fully considered this matter in our hearts, and if
we die we die, and if we live we live.”
They were then asked to sign the following declaration :
“ We, the undersigned Wesleyan teachers, do solemnly and
truly declare that we were fully and carefully informed by the
promoters of the mission to New Britain, New Ireland, etc., of
the dangers which may be incurred to limb and life from the
cannibal propensities of the natives of those islands, and the
insalubrious nature of the climate, which produces fever and
ague and diseases of that character. We were also fully
acquainted with the discomforts we may undergo from want of
the food to which we are accustomed, and from not being able
to speak the language of the people among whom we should
be left without protection or support for some months, and
we declare that, fully knowing all this, we make an election
to proceed on this mission of our own free will, not compelled
thereto by any orders or authority of any one, but simply
desirous of spreading the knowledge of the Gospel of Christ
among the heathen inhabitants of those islands.”

At the last moment one of the married men had to remain
behind, the number from Fiji to eight. On June
15th the John ff esley left for Samoa, where two men and their
wives joined the party, and on the 19th they started for
Rotuma, where they arrived on the 23rd. While they were
there a vessel commanded by a Captain Fury arrived, bringing
the Rev, T. and Mrs. Moore, who had been appointed to Rotuma
in place of the Rev. W. Fletcher, who had been resident
missionary in that island for some years. The latter deter-
mined to accompany Mr. Brown and party to New Britain, for
which place they sailed on the 31st.
On August 14th New Britain was sighted, and the Sydney
—a trading ship commanded by Captain Woodhouse—was a
little ahead of them. The first transaction with the natives
consisted in purchasing a pig, and Mr. Brown says: —“They
(the natives) were quite naked, and not at all a prepossessing
lot.’’ At 1.36 p.m. on the 15th, the ship dropped anchor in
Port Hunter, Duke of York Island, but, being Sunday, the
party remained quietly on board, passing the day in worship,
praise and supplication. How the hearts of this noble band
must have been deeply moved as they afresh dedicated them-
selves to the service of God in the midst of the poor degraded
people to whom He had sent them.
Turning the Sod.
On August 16th the site for the Mission House was selected
at Kinawanua, on the north point of Port Hunter. On
Thursday, the 19th, clearing and other preparations for building
began, and by the 28th a building, 82 feet by 15 feet, was
erected. On the 31st the John Wesley crossed the channel- and
dropped anchor off the island of Matupit by 2.15 p.m. A trip
was made round Simpson’s Harbour and thus early Mr. Brown
began fR make the acquaintance of the place and people. Thp
following day nearly 100 canoes surrounded the ship. The babel
and cpnfusion was immense."- On the 2nd Sept., the Revs.
Brown, Fletcher and Wallis made a trip to a place called Nodupi
While there a quarrel arose among the people, and the party had
a view of native warfare. On Friday, the 80th, they returned
to Port Hupter, and met the s.s. Ripple, Capt. Ferguson, who,
says Mr. ’Brown, “ gave much valuable information, besides
kindly offering to supply both the Wesley and myself with stores,,
of which we are much in need.”
Three weeks from dropping anchor in Port Hunter the
Wesley weighed again and started on her return journey. This
was indeed quick work, and immediately upon her departure,,
arrangements were made for stationing out of the Teachers.


On Sunday, Oct. 10th, Mr. Brown called for volunteers
from among the Teachers to go and occupy stations on New
Britain and New Ireland. All present volunteered! Batu
Livai and Penijimani Caumea were appointed to the former
place ; and Elimotama and Pauliasi Bunoa to the latter. The
meeting, at which this was done, was followed by a prayer-
meeting, “ and earnest and hearty were the prayers which were
offered up for those who were about to proceed as the advance
guard to the larger island of New Britain, where Satan has so
long reigned supreme,”
The campaign was opened at Nodup on the larger island on
Oct. 12th, when the Teachers were put in possession of a very
comfortable house, prepared for them by the Chief, Tobula.
Everything conspired to encourage these servants of God, and
Mr. Brown writes as follows : —“ All passed off well, and the
people who came with us were quite surprised at our reception.
My own heart was full, and I longed to be ab'e to ge away into
the bush to weep for very thankfulness.” A few weeks later the
two volunteers were stationed on New Ireland, and so the work
began to take shape for the glory of God.
Advance.
There were ten men, seven married and three single, who
must be stationed about the group as soon as it could be wisely
done. But it was essential first of all that some knowledge
•of,, the geography of the place should be obtained, also the
relative importance of places and chiefs must be somewhat
understood, and last, but not least, these men and their families
must in some degree become used to the climate before being
sent to live alone at various distances from the head station.
Therefore, as early as possible, journeys were made around
and into the interior of the Duke of York Island. The Lord
was with His servants and they found, on the whole, a kindly
welcome.
This is remarkable when we know that traders had tried to
establish permanent trading relations with the people but had
failed. A Mr. Stevens had lived and traded in Port Hunter for
nearly three years, doing a good business, but just prior to the
.advent of the Mission he became so horrified by the sights he
saw ; was so filled with disgust, and afraid for his life, that he
left the island. Others at intervals, and in different places, also
attempted to trade, and for a time carried on a more or less
successful business, but one and all had been rudely repulsed.
Very valuable aid was rendered to the mission in those early
days by a young man named Lelei, who could speak some
English, and so was the means of communication between the
party and thdpeople.

In rapid succession New Ireland, New Britain, and parts of
Duke of York were visited, and sites for teachers houses were
selected, so that by the end of October the men were being
settled in their various towns throughout the group. To do
this required both courage and tact, with no little patience and
self-denial. All these qualities were shown in a marked degree,
both by the intrepid leader and his followers.
i By the end of February, 1876, fifty miles of the coast of
New Ireland in a northerly direction had been visited, Cape
St. George had been rounded in the south, and a considerable
portion of the eastern side communicated with. The coast of
New Britain from Cape Palliser in the south to Man Island in
the north, a distance of over 100 miles, had been explored, and
the Duke of York Islands occupied. Everywhere splendid
openings for missionary work presented themselves, and a cry
went up from the hearts of the band for more labourers that the
work might be done.
On Friday, January 28th, 1876, the first Christian church
in that group was opened for the worship of the only true and
living God. With devoutly thankful hearts these pioneers
dedicated this first New Britain house of prayer to Him Whose
they were and Whom they served.
Mr. Brown left New Britain for Sydney in October, 1876,
after fourteen months residence'there, during which time vast
pioneer results had been achieved. On the 18th May, 1877, he
again, with Mrs. Brown and two of their children, left Sydney
for their great work, and arrived at their destination on the 21st
August. During his absence events had not been very
prosperous, sickness and other causes contributing to this. But
now the mission was again vigorously prosecuted.
The Heathen Rage.
On Sunday, October 3rd, 1875, Aminio Bale preached t
sermon to his fellow-workers, in which he related some of the
trials of faith and patience endured by the early missionaries to
Fiji. He then said :
“You say* what about us ? We live in a heathen land and
yet have no trials ; the people don’t hate us, and we have plenty
to eat, and we sleep in peace night after night. Where is there
any hatred experienced by us ? Well, I say to you, “ malua ”
(wait a while) “ malua,” our turn will come. God’s word is
true, and we shall be hated yet. Wait a while till you know the
language. Wait a while till you have to reprove these men for
their sins. Wait a while till you begin to preach repentance.
Wait a while till you reprove their pride. Wait a while till you
preach the cross of Christ, and your turn will come.” This


man was no false prophet, and the turn of some of them did
come to lay down their lives for Christ at the hands of the wild
men of New Britain.
On April Bth, 1878, a native presented himself at the
window of the study in which Mr. Brown was sitting, and
reported that the hill natives above Blanche Bay had killed and
eaten Sailasi (the native minister) and three young Fijians who
had gone with him to do the Lord’s business there. It was also
reported that the widows and children of these men were in
great danger of being killed, and it devolved upon the solitary
missionary to devise means for their rescue. This was done
with courage and success, the result being safety to missionary
families in succeeding years.
Reinforcements, Deaths, and Farewells.
On the 2nd December, 1878, it was the privilege of myself
and my wife to land on the shores of the Duke of York Island
at 2 a.m. By sunrise I was at work on the steam launch doing
some repairs to her, and in a few days had visited most of the
mission stations in company with Mr. Brown, and Rev. J. J.
Watsford, who had voyaged with us to that land. It was soon
decided that we should live on the large island of New Britain at
an ,important village called Kabakada. In a few days the timber
for the house was landed, the site selected, and the erection of it
speedily well in hand.
We here present a photo, of old Toke, from whom the
greater portion of the ground on which the new hpuse was built
was purchased. The story of this old man is one of great
interest, and has been told over a great part of Australia. He
was a living example of how God prepares not only places, but
also individual men, for the reception of His messengers long
before they actually arrive, and how this queer-looking old man
helped and cheered us in those early days of pioneer mission
work is a cherished memory. He has his reward.
But the young mission was hard smitten when Mr. Brown
became so ill that he was forced to leave on May Ist, 1879, for
New South Wales, leaving Mrs. Brown and three children at
Duke of York Island. During his absence great and over-
whelming sickness, sorrow, and death camfe upon the mission
party. Two of his children—Wallis and Mabel—died under
most distressing circumstances ; Mrs. Danks and myself were
both much reduced by fever, while most of the teachers and
their wives suffered from repeated attacks of the same. They
endured nobly as “ seeing Him who is Their
patience was above all praise, while the Christian resignation
and cheerful bravery of Mrs. Brown was and is still to us an


inspiration to hope and trust. In March, 1880, Mr. Brown
returned, and the new house on the mainland was at once
occupied by us, and continued to be until 4th of January, 1881,
when Mr. and Mrs. Brown finally left the mission amid the
weeping of many to whom he had been, with those first
volunteers, the messenger of God for their salvation.
This part of this brief history may well close with a
summary, so far as figures can present it, of what had been
accomplished up to this time. The Mission began in August,
OLD TORE.
1875, and Mr. Brown finally left in January, 1881, thus
covering a period of five years and four months. During that
time the Superintendent had been absent one year and nine
months. The work done by our honoured General Secretary in
those few years of residence in New Britain cannot be over
estimated. In every department of missionary toil he laboured
with unwearying diligence, and with no mean success.
Hundreds of miles of savage coast had been explored, people in
scores of towns had been visited, the language had begun to
assume definite shape in the minds of the Missionaries, some
c


school books had been provided, and the Mission fully
established. Finding nothing but savagery in 1875, he left the
following returns in 1881 :
Churches ... ... ... 20
Other Preaching Places ... 20
Native Members ... ... 55
On Trial ... ... ... 28
Local Preachers 6
Sunday and Day Schools ... 29
Sunday and Day Scholars ... 514
Attendants 2390
Tbe Crowning of Tokinkin.
On January 19th, 1881 one of our Church members died.
He was the first of the native Christians to pass from earth to
Heaven. His name was Samuela Tokinkin. We had all learned
to love him because of his gentle spirit and winning ways. I
saw him a few days previous to his death, He had been taken
to the teacher’s house by his own request, that he might die
among Christian men. He did not then seem very ill, and we
had hopes of his recovery. I saw him again a few hours before
he died. He seemed to recognise me, and tried to speak, but
his strength failed him. Most of our Christian young men
were present, and as we knelt around him and commended his
soul to our loving Father’s care a great solemnity settled upon
the hearts of all.
A few days before his death he spoke to his relatives con-
cerning his burial. He said that he was now a Christian, and
desired to be buried like one. He earnestly pleaded that no
heathen custom should be observed in connection with his death.
He told them of his perfect trust in Christ as his Saviour, and
he quietly passed away to be with Him for ever.
On Thursday, the 20th, we buried him in Molot according
to the custom of the Lotu even as he requested. All his relatives
attended the service, and the scene and circumstances were most
impressive. 1 addressed a few remarks to the mourners, con-
trasting the bright hopes of Samuela, now fully realised in the
presence of his Saviour, with the darkness of his former life and
hopes in heathen times. A most beautiful and touching prayer
was offered at the grave by •Aminio Bale, who had been instru-
mental in leading this young man to Christ. Saddened by our
loss, we, nevertheless rejoiced because our Lord had received
unto Himself the first New Britain soul who had died in the
faith of the Son of God. Many have gone since then from that
land to be with Christ, and still they go in ever increasing mem-
bers, to that place where death shall be no more, neither shall there
be mourning nor crying, nor pain any more. For these we
praise God ; but Samuela Tokinkin was our first to be crowned,
aud we praised God for his crowning.

The Steam Launch.
The late Henry Reed, Esq., of Launceston, Tasmania, pre-
sented a steam launch to the Mission in 1877 at a cost of
about £SOO. This was of great service to the cause in those
early days, when it was with great difficulty that natives could
be induced to go from place to place. It was also the means
of saving a vast amount of time. Mr. Brown did his best to
keep her in repair prior to our arrival, but with no practical
knowledge of engineering and, without tools, it was very little
he could do. We landed in Duke of York as stated above on
December 2nd, 1878, at 2 a.m. By six o’clock in the morning
I was hard at work on the launch, and in about a couple of
hours had her sufficiently repaired to steam out and tow in
the John Wesley, which lay becalmed outside the harbour.
But she needed thorough repairing, and for this purpose
new bearings had to be put in her, new bunkers fitted for
fuel, the Government safety valve re-fixed. This was not done
however till we had a rather severe experience. On January
24th, 1879,1 left Kabakada at 4a m. for Duke of York Island,
towing a Samoan boat. When a little more than half way
across she completely broke down. All the sail we had was
carried forward, and we could not beat with that. The Samoan
boat proved useless for towing purposes, and after several attempts
to make progress towards Port Hunter we had to send the boat
away for help. All that day we tossed and drifted down Channel.
In the evening we brought up off the island of Ulu. I
had only one native aboard with me. Not having tasted food
since starting and having no water aboard, we were both much
exhausted. I asked the native to swim ashore with a bottle for
water. He was about to go overboard when a large alligator
came swimming around the launch, keeping his evil eye on
us as he went round her. This prevented all hope of getting
a drink, so rolling ourselves in the sail we passed the night as
best we could. Early in the morning the boat found us and
we reached home about midday, considerably exhausted by our
adventure but very thankful for preserving mercies. A storm
would certainly have driven us out to sea.
It took me three weeks to do all that was necessary. The
forge was at work daily, much to the amazement of the natives.
It was indeed hard work Avith no one to help except in any
heavy lifting. At last we refitted, and we put out to sea,
purposely driving out against wind and wave, Avhich was a very
fortunate thing, for the slide valve spindle broke and we came
to a standstill. Here was indeed a difficulty. How to repair
this ?
Having an eye to possibilities I had begged a large piece of
round iron from the captain of the Wesley prior to her departure,


and now it was just the thing I needed. Blacksmiths well know
the labour of reducing a two inch piece of iron to five-eights
with only an anvil and a hand hammer. But this had to be
done. Further, it must be true, for I had as yet no turning
lathe and all must be done with hammer, fire and file; the
joint too must be forged and fitted by the same means somehow.
Suffice it is to say that this was done in two days, and when
steam was once more up the new piece of machinery was found
to work perfectly. It was a joy to hear once more the thump
of the engine and find she was as staunch as ever.
I once asked old Tomaqaqa of Kabakada to give me an
account of how they felt the first time they saw her. He
described in graphic language their awe as they saw her coming
without sails or oars. Then the smoke puzzled them, and
finally her “waryell” (whistle) struck deep terror into their
souls. They packed their wealth and sent their women and
children away with it into the bush, while they hid themselves
among the scrub, weapons in hand, watching the monster.
“But then” said Tomaqaqa, “those were the days of our
ignorance.”
Many are the stories to be told about this launch. She
was a splendid gift ; did magnificent service, but finally com-
pletely worn out she was broken up and and her parts utilised
in other ways for the good of the Mission.
Loneliness and Bereavement
After the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Brown, both Mrs.
Banks and myself were called upon to endure much personal
sickness, and, with the care of the churches, the sickness of
the scattered members of the Mission Band, murders, fighting
and cannibalism of the people, we were driven close to God as
our only refuge. At one place, a few miles from the Mission
house, three white men were, shot by the natives, and, as a
consequence, the whole white trading population were banded
together against them. This occasioned much concern for the
Teachers in that part, for they were few and the natives were
much excited. Other adverse circumstances perplexed us, and
it was with relief and thankfulness that we welcomed the Rev.
I. Rooney, who, after many years’ service in Fiji, had been
appointed Superintendent of the Mission and Chairman of the
District.
How he bravely held on his way to his destination, through
sorrow and bereavement, is known to many in our Church. He
and Mrs, Rooney left Sydney for New Britain in a trading ship,
Bound there via the Solomon Islands. On the voyage to the
latter place, malarial fever seized her and shortly after their

A Brief History of the


arrival there, she died, and was buried in those lovely but savage
islands. A Christian woman full of faith and good works, who, by
a life of devotion, had proved her love to Christ on the Mission
field ! A kind-hearted trader’s wife, resident on Santa Anna,
took charge of the children, and, after making provision for
their care, Mr. Rooney proceeded to his destination arriving
in Port Hunter on June 23rd, 1881. What a meeting was that
for us under the very shadow of death ! The following extract
is taken from a letter published in our Connexional papers,
written by Mr. Rooney himself, under date June 16th: —“ A
week ago my path was very dark. Living in a hut, without
comfort or conveniences of any kind, wife dying, three children,
one of them a little babe being weaned, the nearest white
woman living on an island sixty miles distant, no help of any
kind save that of the native lad who came with us from Fiji.
Then I cried to God and the promise was given— ‘ Unto the
upright there ariseth light in darkness.’ That very night help
came, and my way opened up before me.”
The man who would not flinch from duty under such
circumstances of bereavement, personal affliction and dis-
comfort, deserves a large place in the esteem of the Methodist
people.
Progress and Reinforcement.
A division of labour made the work more in proportion to
the strength of each of the Missionaries, and rendered a better
supervision of the Mission possible. The crying need of the
times was for more of the revealed will of God in the hands of
the teachers, local preachers, and converts. The Rev. Geo.
Brown was in Sydney preparing a translation of the Gospel
according to St. Mark, but this was of necessity slow work,
made slower by his Deputation work in the States. Then, too, the
knowledge of the language on the part of all was yet imperfect,
and it was only through months of closest application and
most arduous study and research that the Missionaries began
to grow into a grammatical knowledge of the tongue of the
people.
The First Catechism, fourteen hymns, and a few passages
of Scriptures had been prepared by Mr. Brown some two years
before this, and constituted the Mission’s stock of literature for
some years. These were suitable for the Duke of York Islands
and a few towns on New Ireland, but were useless for the great
masses of population on New Britain. Later on a dictionary
of the Duke of York dialect, at the expense of great mental
toil, was prepared and published by Mr ; Brown and myself,


which still continues to render vast help to all who have
occasion to learn that tongue.
To this work the Missionaries devoted themselves night
and day. Mr. Rooney’s intimate knowledge of Fijian was an
immense advantage to the task in hand,, and working together,
we soon * began to see our way through many linguistic
difficulties.
Hindrances, however, came in the form of sickness, and I
was forced to leave for Australia for a change in 1882. In the
meantime Mr. Brown's translation of St. Mark’s Gospel was
received, and sent on its mission of enlightenment and mercy,
while other books and booklets followed by Mr. Rooney and
the writer. All this made strongly for the progress of Christ’s
Kingdom.
Six weeks after the arrival of the Rev. R. H. Rickard and
his noble wife in New Britain in 1882, Mr. Rooney was forced
to leave on account of ill-health, and so this important Mission
was again left in charge of a young Missionary who proved
himself equal to the responsibility. In 1883 we returned to our
work. Later in that year Mr. and Mrs. Rooney also arrived.
While in Victoria, on furlough, he married Miss Swan, the
daughter of Mr. I. Swan, a well-known and highly respected
member of the Brunswick Street Church. And now for the first
time the Mission had three resident Missionaries, two on the
main island and one on Duke of York.
The toil of*house-building was very trying in a climate like
New Britain, and all that Mr. Rickard and his wife wrought and
endured at Raluana at this time would require a volume in itself
to tell. Mr. and Mrs. Rooney continued at Duke of York, and
under their care the work of God was not only more thoroughly
established, but both there and in New Ireland made rapid
progress. Our own work at Kabakada was carried on in the
midst of heathen rage, cannibalism and immorality. There was
fighting between the natives, between German men-of-war and
the people, threats against ourselves and the teachers, attempts
on life and property, and opposition from Romish priests. But
with never-failing love the Lord stood by us, was our chief joy,
and in mercy gave us to see His pleasure prosper in our hands.
Educational institutions of a superior kind were founded at
three points, and a number of young men and women were
being trained for the work of preaching Christ. In the midst
of all this hopefulness came a check. The severe illness of Mrs.
Danks, so prolonged and patiently endured, compelled our
return to the Colonies in 1886. In 1878 we were privileged to
be present at the baptism, by Mr. Brown, of the first seven
converts obtained in this mission of suffering, death, and
triumph. That was the beginning, the first fruits of a great
harvest which has been, and the greater harvest which shall yet

Into the Valley of Death.
Before relating the further progress of the Mission, some*
thing should be said about the men and women, who as truly
went into the valley of death as did the noble six hundred of
our countrymen immortalised by the late Lord Tennyson in
burning, heart-moving words. We refer to the dusky men and
women of onr older Missions, upon whose heart and flesh fell
the heat and burden of the day.
The Tongans had proved their worth as Missionaries in
Samoa, Fiji, and Rotuma, but these were people with whom
they were more or less acquainted. The Samoans and Fijians
had proved their devotion to Christ, and had gladly laid down
their lives for Him in perils among their own countrymen; but,,
in taking these Christians to New Britain, the Church was
making an experiment by putting them in positions, climatic
and physical, which were absolutely new to them, and full of
circumstances which might daunt the bravest. Right nobly did
they respond to the trust reposed in them, shrinking not from
the shock of that onset, nor wavering in fiercest conflicts. At
the opening of the Mission under their intrepid leader, they were
equal to all its demands for dogged perseverance and patient
endurance, and they take rank among the foremost of Christ’a
heralds.
Aminio Bale stands in the very front rank of these heroes.
Judicious, bold, very practical and intensely spiritual. Instinc-
tively they all looked to him and were largely guided by him.
A man of “ single eye,” dogged perseverance and gentle
insistence, whose life told powerfully upon the people of Molot
in particular, and of Duke of York in general! Under him
great victories were won for the Lord Jesus. Entering Molot
when there was not a single Christian native in it, he left it
without a single heathen. His sufferings and losses in the
cause of the Master are surely written in the records of the Lord
of Life,
Mijieli was a pattern of devotion to the cause of Christ in
Waira, that trying place of liars and persecutors. In the calm,
smiling face of Mijieli might be seen the effects of the power of
God’s love, and he certainly “ learned obedience by the thinga
which he suffered.”

New Britain Mission.


A man of energy was Aroni, whom no sickness or peril
could daunt. Brought often to the Mission Station at the point
of death, he would, when scarcely nursed back to life, insist
upon returning to his appointment, and, when remonstrated
with, would plead the necessities of his teacherless town. He
realised, as few do, that —
“ Labour is rest and pain is sweet,
If Thou my God art here.”
Pauliasi Bunoa related to me some of his early experiences
in the town of Kalil on the rough New Ireland shores, as
follow ;
“ Sir, those were hard and trying days ; we were much
afflicted. The people looked at us in wonder, and did not under-
stand our word and work. They were suspicious, too, and at
time would neither sell nor give us food. Many days have I
and my family been hungry and could get nothing to eat, and
no native would assist me to build my house or plant my food
without being heavily paid. There was no love in their hearts
to us, and many weary, anxious, hungry days we passed
through.”
This man lost some of his children, and his wife also under
most distressing circumstances. Yet he could say in patience,
“ The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away: bles ed be the
name of the Lord.”
Here is the s’ory as it was recorded at the time. Sieni,
his wife, had been ill for some time, but foul weather prevented
him from bringing her across to us, or letting us know of her
il ness ; but as she grew worse, he determined to make an
attempt to bring her to us. Accordingly on Friday, the 19th of
June, 1888, he, assisted by other Fijians, placed her in a new
Fijian canoe, and hoisting their little sail they started across the
channel. Now for his own words : —“ The sea was very rough,
sir; the waves were large, and the wind was strong. We
paddled, and were getting near to Kinawanua, when we were
met by a very strong wind which came out of a very black
■cloud, and the current becoming stronger we could not prevail
against it, but were driven back again towards Kuras. We were
very tired, sir, and we drifted, and Sieni died while we drifted !
When we neared the New Ireland shore, we got out of the
current somewhat, and then the wind abating a little we hoisted
sail once more, and got ashore at Kabasonsi. Next morning we
buried her.” Here ended the narration of one of the most
touching events of this Mission. What, a story could some make
out of this ! The frail canoe tossed by the surging billows, and
relentlessly driven by a rushing current; the cry of the strong
but weary crew; the anxious husband and the dying wife
washed by the dashing spray ! It was thus that Sieni, smiling,
good Sieni, passed from earth to heaven.
30
A Brief History of the


Peni Naiwalni was instrumental in God’s hands of doing
much good on the Kininigunan Coast. He passed away upon
his knees, with his last breath saying, “ Jesus ! Jesus ! ” Anasa
Rakabo, at Raluana, endured the contradiction of the heathen
year in year out, and was content to so labour, though
little fruit appeared to cheer him. Bright, cheerful, faithful
Anasa ! Ratu Livai walked in the light and love of God in the
midst'of the wild Matupit men, planting the truth under the
most discouraging circumstances, the fruit of which was to be
seen after many days. Mesaki Bahulu, a native of Tonga, was
strong-minded, imperious, but remarkably successful in the
management of natives, as the following incident shows. He
was stationed at one end of the town of Kabakada, and we were at
the other. On one occasion his people came to ours and began
a quarrel, which appeared likely to end very seriously. We
were endeavouring to secure peace, but it seemed hopeless, when
Mesaki appeared on tbe scene. He went up to one of his own
people, took the spears out of his hand, and began to use them
in a jocular way upon the men, as one uses a cane, and at the
same time he ordered them to go home. This so amused the
people that their anger ceased as by magic ; and shouts of fierce
rage were almost immediately exchanged for roars of laughter
as they scampered away to their houses. It was a long time
before they could speak without laughing of this act of Mesaki’s.
We are sure no white man could have adopted this method
except at the serious risk of losing his life.
Misieli, a Samoan, won our admiration by his action
during a fight between the Molot and Urakukuru men. He
rushed between the contending parties amidst the flying spears
and sling stones. Stick in hand he beat down many spears,
breaking some, and by his earnest pleading caused a cessation
of hostilities and afterwards helped to arrange terms of peace.
It was indeed a brave thing to do, for the men were very angry
with each other, and were almost beyond reason in their rage.
Hafoka, Sositeni, Malati, and a host of others crowd in
upon the mind as we write, men and women after the image
and likeness of Christ in fortitude and in fidelity to God. They
lie in ever-increasing numbers in our burying-places, and still
others, at the call of God, cheerfully follow in their steps to
suffer and die for Him who died for them. Into the valley of
death these men steadily marched and found in it the gateway
of life.
As an instance of their eagerness to go out for Christ
into the regions beyond, we clip the following from the
Melbourne Spectator of May 28th, 1897, in which the editor
relates an incident which occurred while we were in Fiji on our
way to New Britain :
I was searching No. 6 of my Fiji letter-books the other


day for some reference I wanted, and on page 492 I came upon
the following copy of a letter written to the Rev. John Watsford
nearly twenty years ago, when the Rev. Benjamin Banks and
his young bride were staying with us in the Navuloa Mission
House on their way to begin their work in New Britain. The
Rev. J. J. Watsford also was with them, taking the trip in the
John Wesley for the benefit of his health. A number of Fijian
volunteers were waiting for the mission vessel to complete her
work in the group, when they would embark, together with the
Rev. B. Banks, and set sail for New Britain. The letter is
dated ‘ Navuloa, October 19th, 1878,’ and contains the following
narrative, which may be of interest to our readers as showing
what sort of stuff our Fijian native agents are made of :
“ On the evening of our visitors’ arrival, as we were having
a comfortable chat, a native came in, and squatted on the floor.
He is a Nakelo man, Kameli by name, and is one of those who
are going to New Britain. He volunteered when George Brown
first came here for teachers, but was rejected because he is a
bachelor. When the General Secretary’s request for men came
to us this year, we laid it before the Quarterly Meetings, and
asked for volunteers. Kameli got up in our meeting, and
•delivered himself as follows— ‘ Here, sir, am I, and this is what
is in my mind. On the day when Mr. Brown begged for men
at Navuloa, on that very day I heard the voice of God. He
■called me by name, and I said ‘ Here am I.’ You were not
willing to let me go because I had no wife, but that word of the
Lord has been ever abiding in my soul, and now to-day I hear
it again with my ears. Let me go, sir! Forbid me not! The
Lord is calling me, and I beseech you to set me free that I may
go.’ *
I told him I would consult the Chairman, and I did so.
He consented on the ground that, though we had decided not to
send unmarried men, this was evidently a special case. So I
sent word to Kameli, and straightway he became the plague of
my life. He dime to Navuloa and besought me, with tears in
his eyes, not to change my mind about him. I told him it was
all right; we should not change our minds if his own resolve
held out; and he said it was well, but he had feared lest his
want of a wife should stop him after all. So strong was this
fear of his that he rushed throughout the district making
offers of marriage to all the widows of Nakelo, Tokatoka, and
Notho, to say nothing of Ndravo, Ndaku, and other minor
places; and when he had been refused by them all, he came
back again to me.
‘ I have tried every one of the women, sir,’ he reported.
■* All of them said ‘ No!’ They would not have me. And it is
well, for I don’t care about any of them, only I was afraid lest
you should alter your minds about my going because I have not
■one.’ I laughed, and told him to be off.


THE FIRST RALUANA HOUSE.
33
New Britain Mission.


Then came the news of the murder (the massacre of the
native minister, Silas, and the teachers who went with him to
the New Britain hill-country), and, after consultation with the
Chairman, I sent word to all our volunteers, telling them the
news, and that they were free to draw back if they wished.
The others contented themselves with simply telling my
messenger that they refused to withdraw from their offer, but
Kameli came hotfoot to the Mission House, sat himself down
on the grass before the verandah, and poured out his soul.
‘Am I then to stay,’ he asked, ‘ because those men are
killed ? Why should I stay ? Their places are vacant. Is it
a new thing for us Fijians to be killed ? Why is your soul
small because of that slaughter ? We are not afraid. Some
are slain, it is true —that was Satan’s work—but the Lord is
living still,’ and he threw out his left hand with a contemptuous
sweep, finally disposing of the devil and all his works, and then
he hurst into tears. ‘ Let me go, sir,’ he sobbed out. ‘ Forbid
me not!’—and there were wet eyes on the verandah as well
as on the grass in front of it.
“ When the Wesley arrived, Kameli came to Navuloa with
his baggage corded and his loins girded. He was for starting
at once, and it was not without great difficulty that I persuaded
him to go back to Nakelo and wait until the vessel was ready to
sail. I promised to send him wprd in good time, but he did
not wait for it. His next appearance was that mentioned by
me in the beginning of my letter, when he came and squatted
on the floor on the evening of our guests’ arrival.'
‘ I have brought my box, sir,’ he said.
‘ All right,’ I replied. ‘ Put it in such and such a house,
and then go back to Nakelo and wait for the word.’
“He patted the floor with his hand. ‘ I shall see Nakelo
no more,’ he said in a quiet tone. ‘ I shall stay here in Navuloa
and wait for the Johnny (the John Wesley ). Why should Igo
back ? I might be too late.’
“ The real fact was He could not get it out of his head
that his bachelorhood might after all turn out to be a fatal
objection. It was in vain that I assured him the vessel would
not sail without him. I could not persuade him to go back.
‘ I have taken my departure from town,’ he said. ‘I am now
in the path, and I cannot go back. Let me go on; and when
I reach that land I shall be at rest.’ His face shone as he
spoke, and you may take it for granted that he had his own
way.”


Steady Growth.
In 1897 the Rev. F. B. Oldham succeeded to the post
vacated by our return to Australia. He met with no small
'difficulties at the outset. The station had been vacant for nearly
.twelve months, with the usual results in a heathen community.
Rev. F. B. and Mrs, OLDHAM,
There had been epidemics, earthquakes, and unchecked quarrels
.among the people. The Chairman of the District gives a vivid
picture of what this young Missionary encountered :
“ The Kabakada section, with its sickness, native quarrels,
and the difficulties of managing the work among the people in
35
Neic Britain Mission.


times of severe visitation, when the heavens above and the earth
beneath are believed to be full of evil spirits bent on the destruc-
tion of all, and every man is against his neighbour, has required
a deal of anxious thought, in addition to our monthly visit to it.
The Rev. F. B. Oldham arrived in June to take charge there!
.... but he has been cruelly retarded, and much of his
ardour damped by severe and frequent attacks of fever,”
He, however, held on under conditions, which would have
caused men of less strength of purpose to fail, and, before his
departure from the Mission in 1894, he saw much of the old
opposition cease, and many evils weakened, and by years of
patient endurance had seen the membership of his section not
only considerably increased, but also develop a stronger spiritual
life.
“ On July 27th, 1891, the Rev. Wm. Brown arrived in Duke
of York Island. He at once gave himself up to the training of a
native agency. In this he was very successful. The sad death
of Mrs. Brown, who was greatly beloved of the people, was a
severe bereavement This calamity had frequently threatened
other Missionaries in that land of sickness, but Mrs. Brown was
the first of the European staff to die and be buried in New
Britain. Mr. Brown’s subsequent struggle with adverse
circumstances of family life, and personal affliction, forms a-
very pathetic chapter of our Mission history. In 1891 he
found a membership of 399 members, in 1895 he left 640 as a
monument of his faith and zeal in the work.
In February, 1892, the Rev. R. H.. Rickard finally left the
group. It is difficult to sum up the worth and work of some
men within such limited space as we have at our command.
Mr. Rickard’s work in New Britain is of such a character. In ■
manual toil at house building, in school organising, in super- ■
vision of the mission as Chairman, and in general missionary
activity his life was one of labours,more abundant. Bub
perhaps the most substantial part of his work lies in his literary
productions in the language of the main island of New Britain..
In 1883 he was appointed to that island, having previously
resided on Duke of York, and he left in 1892 the Gospels and
Acts of the Apostles, also several school books, and, to crown
all, a splendid dictionary, which will ever remain a monument
of his mental activity, his industry and zeal. In his preface
to that work he accords generous praise to others in the
following terms '“ Considering that it’ (thfe dictionary) is the
result of only four years study of the language, of which up to
that time we knew nothing, and of which nothing had been
written, except a leaflet for school use by the Rev. B. Danks,
which contained only about one hundred words of the language,,
it may not be regarded as insignificant.
“ During the greater part of the time mentioned we were=

co-workers with the Rev. B. Banks, who was an indefatigable
student of the language. Though we both worked indepen-
dently, we had frequent conversations and communications
relative to the language, specially in preparing school books and
Scripture translations ; in this way we got a deal of help from
each other, and checked each other’s conclusions. This volume
undoubtedly owes a very great deal to Mr. Banks, and I freely
acknowledge my obligations to him. lam also indebted to him
for most of the words marked Kabakada ; to these would have
been added many more had Mr. Banks’ permission to use his
M.S. (dictionary) arrived in time.”
“ I am also indebted to the Rev. I. Rooney, who from his
long and extensive knowledge of South Sea Island philology,
has given me many suggestions, and in cases of difficulty has
been my referee.”
Mr. Rickard also makes grateful acknowledgment of the
benefit derived in this his great work through the philological
-studies of the Revs. Geo. Brown and B. Banks, embodied in
their dictionary of the Buke of York dialect. The story of
literary labours in New Britain, beginning with that of the
founder of the mission, ending with Mr. Rickard’s dictionary,
is a story of unceasing application, “ weary yet pursuing,”
overloaded yet struggling on, until a large proportion of the
Word of God was given to the people. Such a story ought to
be told in a separate volume.
In August, 1893. the Rev. Win. J. Chambers arrived in the
Group and began work at Raluana. Buring his years of service
the Lord wrought signs and wonders under his ministry, as in
the case of Bros. Brown and Crump in their respective sections
ot the work. The set time to favour New Britain had come,
.and reaping with these brethren was a full employment,
.accompanied with glad shouts of harvest home. He found
upon his arrival that there were 180 members of the church in
his Raluana section and 86 on trial The latest returns, which
are for 1900, show 747 members, and 70 on trial. The Con-
ference held in 1900, appointed Mr. Chambers to New Ireland to
superintend the opening of the new stations there. At present
he is residing at George Brown College, on the island of Ulu,
until the return from Australia of the Rev. J. A. Crump. The
-work on New Ireland will prove very arduous, and make large
■demands upon a constitution already much debilitated by the
fevers of New Britain. We trust that God’s blessing will attend
this good man’s’efforts on behalf of the people of New Britain.
The Rev. John A. Crump arrived in the Mission in 1894,
at once entered upon a time of fierce battle with heathenism
in the Kabakada section. In his first report, written only a few
months after his settlement there, he writes : - “ Fighting is
ibeing carried on among the natives near Kabakada, on account


of an insult offered to the Duk-duk, and about half-way between
my station and Mr. Chambers’, cannibalism has been going on
also.” He began bis work under circumstances of severe dis-
couragement, but the Lord had gracious purposes for both him-
self and his charge During 1896 a very powerful work of grace

broke out upon all the stations under his care, and at a place
called Luen the power of God to save was manifested in a most
remarkable manner, compelling the Missionary to say—“ I never
saw it on this wise before,” and he wrote with abounding joy
praise for God’s goodness to the people over whom he had
been placed.
39
New Britain Mission.


For some time it was felt that, seeing these islands had
come under the German Government, and that New Britain had
become a German Colony, it was desirable that a German
Methodist minister should be appointed to the Mission. The
reasons for this need not be stated, but the appointment has
hitherto been followed by the happiest results. Application was
made by the Society to the German Methodist Church for a
man. The Rev. H. Fellmann volunteered, and on the
20th February, 1891, arrived at Raluana to contiue the work of
Rev. Wm. Chambers, who occupied the Kabakada house when
Mr. Crump went to reside at Duke of York. Mr. and Mrs.
Fellmann have had to contend with climatic and other adverse
influences, but through all they continue steadfast in faith and
good works, abiding in the affections of the Brethren and the
natives, and enjoying the confidence of the Board of Missions.
George Brown College,
In 1897 Mr. Crump removed to the Duke of York group to take
up the work vacated by the retirement of Rev. Wm. Brown
to Colonial work. By severe manual toil, he established a Train-
ing Institution on the Island of Ulu, into which promising
young men and women may be drafted from all parts of the
Mission and thoroughly trained for the preaching of the Gospel.
It is Mr. Crump’s earnest endeavour to establish this Institution
upon a self-supporting basis, and his efforts are being watched
with considerable interest throughout the whole of our Missions.
In the following letter the Rev. F. W. Walker, of the
L.M.S., tells of what he saw on his recent visit to Ulu. We
regard it as a very high compliment to Mr. Crump and
his work.
London Missionary Society,
78 Pitt Street, Sydney,
August 16th, 1901.
My Dear Mr. Danes, —
Some time ago I was in New Britain, and had an oppor-
tunity of visiting Mr. Crump’s station at Ulu. I was very much
impressed with the work which he is doing there. He took me
over an extensive clearing which was all under cultivation and
it was very gratifying to hear that all this work had been done
by the students in the intervals of school hours. The natives in
the islands cannot with advantage be kept confined too long in
school, and great advantages can be secured for the Mission, and
still greater advantages can be conferred upon the students by
the judicious disposal of a certain proportion of their time in


profitable industrial work. The men themselves become hardier
and acquire habits of industry, which are calculated to contri-
bute much to their success as teachers in after years. At the
same time the Mission may, under good management,
secure returns from this labour, which may do much towards
making the work in the islands self-supporting, an end in every
Avay greatly to be desired.
I am glad to see that your missionaries in New Britain are
all of them fully alive to the importance of such an enterprise,
and in Mr. Crump you have a man well fitted to carry it to a
successful issue.
I am, Dear Sir,
Yours sincerely,
F. W. Walker.
The Rev. J. A. and Mrs. CRUMP.
In his last report, for 1900, Mr. Crump says:—“ The
progress made in the scholastic department has been consider-
able. We have spared no pains to give the students a real
sound training, and have striven to make the daily Bible study
the most interesting and profitable part of the curriculum.
There were 44 students in residence when the Report was
written, and the work put on a thoroughly good foundation.
They have not only grown enough food for their own use, but
have sold a considerable quantity, and so obtained money for
missionary contributions. When there were thirty-eight students
they contributed the sum of £l9, while they have planted 10,000
cocoanut trees without infringing upon their ordinary school
work.” This is no mean record, for which we thank God, and
the good men God has given our Church in New Britain.”


The great present need of Ulu is a Missionary Sister to help
in the training of the students’ wives, of whom there are 29 in
residence. Mr. Crump writes wisely when he says ; —“ If these
women are to lead and help the women in the villages, some
training must be given to them, and we trust that now the
long-asked-for appointment (of a Missionary Sister) will be
made.
We, who know both the value and the need of this good
work follow Bro. Crump’s efforts with the greatest interest, and
earnest prayers for the success of the George Brown College.
In 1900 he returned to Australia for a well earned rest and for
medical treatment. But even while there most of his time was
taken up in putting a translation of the New Testament
through the press. This is a great work, the result of the
combined labours of all the Missionaries who have resided on
the largest island of the group, and is to each of them a cause
for devout thanksgiving.
A Powerful Appeal-
The following extracts from a series of resolutions passed
by the New Britain District Synod in 1898 set forth the pressing
need of the District at the time :
“We beg to call the best attention of the Board and Confer-
ence to the following facts : Our Mission has been estab-
lished twenty-three years. The number of white agents
has never exceeded three. The last fifteen years requests
have been constantly sent for an increased supervising staff,
but never been granted. There has been, for a good portion
of the time, only one Missionary to supervise the work of
the two circuits. The number of teachers in 1882 was 80,
whereas to-day our native helpers are 98. The number of
members and adherents are about four times that of 1882.
“ The present boundaries of our actual work in the Duke of
York Circuit comprises the whole of the Duke of York
Group, and from Kurumut to Palabog on the West coast of
New Ireland across to Kudukudu, on the East coast, with
all the bush villages included in these boundaries.
“ Duke of York is fifteen miles distant from New Ireland,
whilst the distance from Kurumut to Palabog is about
twenty miles. In close proximity to Lotu villages war and
cannibalism are rampant, and it is not safe to leave our
assistant teachers without the supervision and protection of
the white man, while in cases of sickness our eighteen-
agents are without medical assistance or care.


“ No better evidence of the people’s desire for the ‘ Lotu ’ can
be brought forward than the fact that villages in which a
service has never been held have contributed to our funds
this year, and while the nearest Lotu villages to the places
are too far away to permit their attending public worship,
yet, when they hear the drums calling people to service,
they will cover up their nakedness, cease from plantation
work and sit silent in their villages till they suppose worship
is finished, then their waist clothes are thrown aside and
work is resumed,
“We confidently place this matter before the Board and
Conference in the expectation that these facts will receive
the most careful consideration.”
That heathen men should thus robe themselves, and wait
upon God in their ignorance, is a very beautiful yet very pitiful
incident, and was regarded by our people as none other than the
voice of God commanding the Methodist Church to rise and
go forward.
Later on these poor people prepared their food on Satur-
day, and tramped long distances on the Sunday to hear the
Word in Christian villages. They crowded the Church, and
those who could not get in stood outside, catching as much of
the Message of Salvation as they could, and after the services
returned to their homes.
How Help Came to New Britain.
The above appeal, and the cry of the people for help,
moved the hearts of many Christian people to generous helpful-
ness, but none more so than the Rev. Thomas Champness, of
England, who stated the case in the Joyful News with great
earnestness, asking who would go. He also wrote to Dr. Brown
as follows: —“ I felt quite excited when I read of the present
need of these poor cannibals, and I can’t get out of my mind the
picture of hundreds of them waiting to hear the Gospel.”
“ Would you mind telling me if you have got men to send
there if you could get the money, and, if so, how much it would
cost to send a lay agent there to work among those people who
go to the chapel but cannot get in ? I should like somebody to
go and work among them. iSupposing money were given me
and a suitable man were found here, should you feel inclined to
accept him, the Joyful News Mission becoming responsible for
his passage money and support ?
“ It is possible that the feeling which is in my heart is
from above, and that God means us to assist you. The
question arises, however, would you accept such assistance, and,
secondly, how much the outlay would be. I should prefer to

“ I am opening my heart to you, and I want you to tell me
frankly what you think of my scheme.

jou, and I am writing this in the hope that you will tell me
frankly what is your mind on this matter.”
A later letter, in answer to one of thanks and acceptance
of this proffered help from the Board of Missions, shows what a
large-hearted, faithful man this servant of God is. Among other
things he says : —“ You knovv the Joyful JVeiva Mission is depen-
dent upon the unasked kindness of the Methodist people. We
do not make personal appeals for contributions. At times it


looks as though we should be compelled to stop for means. Just
now we have been in straits, but we told our people through our
little paper, and money is again flowing in May I
ask you to tell the people of Australia that we need their prayers,
so that we may find the kind of agents required. I hope that
this is the beginning of a movement which will lead to many
giving to aid the Colonies in this much-needed work.”
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. Pearson were selected by Mr. Champness to
represent British Methodism on New Ireland. They arrived in
Sydney from England in the month of March (1901), and left
for New Britain in the s.s. Moresby on May the Bth. The latest
accounts show that they are settling down to their work, and we
trust that health will be granted them and that their term of
service may be long and blessed in the land to which they go,
constrained thereto by thelove of God.
At the New South Wales Conference (1901) an appeal was
made for another volunteer for this Mission to take charge of
the Kabakada Station, from which the Rev. Wm. Chambers had
been removed in order that he might superintend the operations
on New Ireland. The Rev. W. H. Cox offered for this work, and
■was accepted by the Conference and the Board. He also has
entered upon his labours, and for him we bespeak the earnest
prayers of God’s people.
A Good Record.
The following summary of the work done in New Britain
was written as an appendix to the Synod Minutes in October,
1900, and signed by the Revs. Wm. Chambers and H. Fellman,
as Chairman and Secretary of the District: —
“ This being the twenty-iifth year in the history of our
Mission in New Britain (Neu Pommern), we desire to record our
sincere thankfulness to God for the great and manifold blessings
vouchsafed to us and all the brethren who have laboured in this
land,
“We are filled with lively gratitude to the Giver of all
good for the ■wondrous changes wrought out by Him through
the instrumentality of the Wesleyan Missionaries and the noble
men of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, who have so freely given them-
selves to God’s cause in this colony.
“We remember with peculiar thankfulness the earnest,
devoted labours of our predecessors, and wish to give expression
in the strongest possible manner to our appreciation of all they
did and suffered to lay the foundations of our present unqualified
success.
“An enumeration of these noble men and their equally
devoted wives is unnecessary here, suffice it to say that we

rejoice over what they accomplished, and feel it to be an honour
to follow a path along which such have gone. We commend
these brethren to God, and pray that His best blessings may
attend them continually.
“ Through all the years that have passed God has graciously
watched over His servants, and while some have been called
away, and many are now sleeping peacefully, who once nobly
helped in our work, still we can rejoice in the fact that no
white missionary has been called upon to lay down his life in
New Britain (Neu Pommern). It is a source of gladness to us
to know that every missionary who has borne a part in the
New Britain (Neu Pommern) work is still filling an honourable
position in our Church. To God be the praise
, “ Our position and prospects as a Mission after twenty-five
years’ work are such as fill us with thanksgiving. Our success,
as it is in evidence to-day, has far outstripped the brightest
hopes of the most sanguine. From whatever standpoint our
work may be viewed, the one picture of God-given success is
visible on every hand. If we have aught to relate of failure it is
entirely on our part ; God has been faithful to His promises.
“ Twenty-five years ago New Britain (Neu Pommern) was
the land of ignorance, cruelty, war, oppression of the weak,
murder, cannibalism ; whereas, to-day, on Duke of York (Neu
Lauenburg), New Ireland (Neu Mecklenburg), and the Gazelle
Peninsula, wherever the influence of our Mission extends, the
Gospel of Christ has exerted such a power that the people dwell
in peace, security, and prosperity ; where formerly the sounds of
war and strife were heard continually, to-day may be heard
songs of praise from a grateful people to the God they have
learned to know and to serve.
“ Twenty-two years ago the people of New Britain (Neu
Pommern) cruelly and treacherously slew some of our teachers,
but to-day the attitude of our people has so changed towards the
“ lotu ” that it has long been beyond our power to keep pace
with the pressing demands made upon us for pastors and
teachers. On every hand we perceive that Christianity is not
merely making a superficial change in the conditions and habits
of the people, but is touching their hearts and influencing their
lives and conduct. Many of our people experience a sense of
God’s presence in their lives, and many in the hour of death
have realised the saving presence of - Christ.
“ Originally our work was carried on solely by the agency of
men from Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, under the supervision of
two or three —but never more than three —white missionaries ;
but at the present time the majority of our stations are manned
by Native teachers, who are the direct fruits of our Mission here.
So now that we have over 70 young men occupying the positions.


of village pastors and schoolmasters among their own country-
men, while in addition we have a force of 103 local preachers
assisting in the evangelisation of this large and populous group.
“ This year our returns shows that we have 1896 full
members and 546 on trial, and though the standard for member-
ship is a comparatively high one, and the utmost caution is used
m the reception of each individual member, our membership is
now double that of six years ago.
“ Our Mission, besides caring for the spiritual needs of
upwards of 13,000 adherents, maintains 101 schools, in which
elementary instruction is given to more than 3000 scholars ;
while, to meet the requirements of any seeking for further
instruction, we have two Circuit Training Institutions, conducted
by the Missionaries, and the George Brown College at Ulu is
now in full work, with a roll of students numbering 44.
“ While supervising this large and constantly growing work,
the Missionaries have determined to keep pace with the literary
requirements of the people ; and while unable to accomplish all
they have wished for, they still have achieved no mean results
in this department.
“ On Duke of York (Neu Lauenburg) the people have the
Gospel in their own language, also a large and tine collection
of hymns, together with a catechism and a selection of readings
from the Old and New Testament. On New Britain (Neu
Pommern) our people have the four Gospels and the Acts of the
Apostles in their own dialect, also a good collection of hymns, a
catechism, the Order of Administration of Sacraments, the
Burial Service, and a reading-book with arithmetic for school
purposes. During the past year a translation of the remaining
portion of the New Testament —Acts to Revelation—has been pre-
pared for printing.
“ Financially our position is most cheering. The contri-
butions to our Mission Funds have this year reached the sum of
£650, which, compared with the amount of £252 14s. raised in
1895, shows an increase during five years of £397 6s.
Altogether, we have received in voluntary contributions from
Neu Pommern during the said five years the sum of £2700.
This fact alone speaks volumes as to the place the “ lotu ” holds
in the opinion of the natives.
“In August, our 25th anniversary was celebrated on
Matupit, by meetings of an interesting and profitable character.
Great indeed was the enthusiasm of the people, and many an
earnest testimony was borne by them as to the blessed changes
resulting from the introduction of Christianity into their
country,
“ Truly it was a soul-stirring sight, these crowds of people,
who but a few years ago were living in heathen darkness and

unspeakable degradation, now respectably clothed, orderly and
decent in their conduct, met together for the purpose of
celebrating the anniversary of the brightest of all days that had
ever dawned in their history—rthat day when ‘ the Sun of
Righteousness arose with healing in His wings.’
“In conclusion, we wish to emphasise the fact that past
successes may yet be surpassed. Our present position has been
attained amidst difficulties neither few nor insignificant. If our
Church will give the support, which our work imperatively
demands, and for which we have so long and earnestly pleaded
—pleaded, alas, in vain—the future has possibilities of successful
work such as the past has not known. Every island of the
Archipelago is now open to us, our work has found favour with
man, on every side the cry is heard, ‘ Come over and help us/
God has set upon our work the seal of Divine approbation.
“ The word is, ‘Go forward.’ We would fain obey. We
are but three, nay, at present but two, to care for and direct all
these 103 teachers, more than 100 local preachers, 2442
members, and nearly 13,000 adherents.
“ Sickness comes at times even to us, and one is compelled
to rest, then one has to struggle alone with the already over-
burden.
“ The success for which the Church prayed has been
given ; that very success has increased our work to such an
extent that we are compelled to cry for help to our fathers and
brethren. Shall our cry still be in vain ?”
Conclusion.
As we have already seen, the New Britain Mission was
founded in 1875, and has at the present time been in existence
twenty-six years. The foregoing pages clearly show that the
work has been done at no little cost of self-denial on the part of
the men and women stationed there. At no time in its history
has there been anything like an adequate staff in the Mission,
and very frequently the European portion of it has been reduced
to one man and his wife. It has been impossible to extend very
much the area of operations for the same reason, but the
prospects are now very bright. Through the prayers, faith and
liberality of God’s people who are called Methodists, we look for
great things in New Britain.
We may well conclude this with the following extracts
from a letter received by the General Secretary from a gentleman
who recently visited New Britain. He writes under date June
10th, 1901 : —“ I have visited a great many missions, and have
been in position to hear of many, for my grandfather was for


many years President of the American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions, and I have never seen a work which
seems so marvellous in the changes it is producing in this
utterly barbarous, cannibal race. I have been for a month with
Mr. Fellman, and have visited most of his principal churches
and many of his teachers, and have also been greatly interested
in Mr. Chambers’ work on Ulu Mr. Fellman
and Mr. Chambers are already over-burdened with work, and I
think it a miracle that with only three white men the work has
reached the proportions it has. , . . It seems to me that
the world has seldom seen a greater opportunity.”
This gentleman points out that we ought to do more, if
possible, for the children. More workers are needed who are
apt to teach and lovers of children. This certainly ought to
receive the early attention of our Society. The recent reinforce-
ments do not by any means meet the requirements of this great
and expanding Mission, and
Can we whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high,
Can we to men‘benighted
The lamp of life deny ?
Salvation, 0 Salvation,
The joyful sound proclaim
Till each remotest nation

The following is a statement of the present strength (1900)
of the Church in this particular Mission, and we may well say,
