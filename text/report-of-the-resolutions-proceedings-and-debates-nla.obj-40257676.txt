VOTING IN DIVISIONS—MANNER OF.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I beg to move —-
That, in divisions, the voting shall he as States—that is, each
State represented shall have only one vote.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS seconded the motion, which
was agreed to.
REPORTING THE PROCEEDINGS.
It was resolved that the debates of the Conference
be reported by the Victorian Hansard staff.
ADMISSION OF THE PRESS.
The PRESIDENT.—-On the question of the admis-
sion of the press, at recent Conferences the practice
has been to admit the press to the general proceedings.
It has been found necessary from time to time to go
into Committee, and in Committee the press do not
listen to what we are saying, and do not report it.


Mr. FIHELLY moved—
That the press be admitted to the meetings of the Con-
ference, except when the Conference is sitting in Committee.
Mr. LOUGHLIN seconded the motion, which was
agreed to.
OPENING CEREMONY.
His Excellency the LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR
(the. Hon. Sir William Hill Irvine, K.C.M.G.),
arrived at 3.5 p.m.
The PRESIDENT said —Your Excellency, I have
great pleasure in inviting you to open the Conference.
His Excellency the LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR.
—Mr. President, honorable Premiers and Ministers,
I have much pleasure in appearing in this Hall on an
occasion very different from any of those on which I
have been present here in former times. Eirst of all,
1 desire to extend to all Premiers and Ministers from
other States a very hearty welcome to Victoria.
Standing, as I do, under the watchful eye of the
Premier of this State, there is very little, I think, that
I can venture to .say on an occasion of this sort. Almost
everything that comes to my mind to say is just the kind
of thing that I know I ought not to say; but there are
two thoughts to which I may venture to give expression
which are quite beyond the field of controversial
politics, and which are, I think, suitable for an occasion
when there are gathered together distinguished men
from the various parts of Australia who are intrusted
with the guidance of the destinies of the States at this
very critical time. The first is that it should never
be forgotten that, whatever changes there may he in
future in the Constitution of Australia, the States,
under our Constitution as it now stands, have within
their own territories and within the wide sphere of
their own .action in legislation and administration, as
high and independent sovereign authority as they had
before Federation. That, I think, should never he
forgotten. The other thought that conies into my mind
is this —that, if there is to he any alteration in the
Constitution of Australia, it is the desire, I believe,
of all of us that it should be brought about as the
result of the calm and, as far as humanly possible,
well-formed judgment of the people of Australia, and
not by pressure of financial or any other circumstances
whatever. Gentlemen, I know you have a great deal
nf important business before you, and I now have the
honour to declare this Conference open, expressing
the earnest desire that your deliberations may be con-
ducted in harmony and may he crowned with success.
Mr. STOREY.—I move—
That the thinks of the Conference he presented to His
Excellency for the gracious speech which he has been pleased
to address to us.
Mr. FIHELLY.—In seconding the motion, I should
like to say that I think that the words of His
Excellency in regard to having the best thought of
the community brought to bear upon all public ques-
tions should appeal to every individual. I know that
the Lieutenant-Governor, having to change from a
position of advising the Crown to that of being
advised by Ministers, finds the atmosphere occasionally
varying. I hope that I may not he trenching now on
any matter of public import in a way that may be
subsequently dangerous to debate in saying that I
trust that Your Excellency may be permanently
appointed to the position of Governor. We hope in
Queensland to have our own Governor appointed there,
and I trust that it is not too much out of place to hope
that the same thing will happen here. Inspiration
must come from the top —you must have the brains
of the community giving inspiration to the public. I
hope that will be found workable in public life, and
be adopted also in this State. On behalf of Queensland,
I thank Your Excellency very much for coming here.
We have heard with pleasure your few remarks, and
we trust that this Premiers’ Conference, although
Federal rights and State rights may come into collision,
will have beneficial results. Personally, I am more
of the Australian type. In Queensland we have our
State insurance and other public enterprises, hut, for
the good of the public, we would willingly hand over
to the Commnowealth any such enterprise, and perhaps
break Australia up into a few more States. I thank
Your Excellency on behalf of .Queensland.
The motion was carried by acclamation.
His Excellency the LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR.
—Mr. President, and gentlemen, I thank you very
warmly for the vote of thanks which you have just
carried.
His Excellency then withdrew.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER.
The PRESIDENT announced that Mr. Storey, Pre-
mier of New South Wales, had presented a report re-
specting action taken under authority of resolutions
adopted at former Conferences.
The report was ordered to lie on the table.
RAILWAY MATTERS.
The PRESIDENT announced the receipt of letters
from the Railways Commissioner of South Australia,
and Chairman of the Cbmmissiouers’ Conference, 1920
(Mr. J. McGuire), on the questions of unification of
gauges and a Commonwealth ad valorem duty on mate-
rial required for railway works.
The letters were ordered to be placed on the Agenda
Paper.
INVITATION TO PRIME MINISTER.
It was decided, on the motion of Mr. STOREY, to
invite the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to at-
tend the Conference on the following day (Saturday)
at 10 a.m.
AGENDA COMMITTEE.
Mr. MITCHELL moved—
That an Agenda Committee be appointed, consisting of the
President, Mr. Storey, and Mr. Fihelly.
The motion was agreed to.
ORDER OF BUSINESS—APPOINTMENT OF
SUB-COMMITTEES.
The PRESIDENT.—The next matter is the order in
which business will be taken- Wei are, I take it, nre-
pared to go: on with items 1 to 5 under the heading of
“ States Matters.” In regard to item No. 6,'” Treat-
ment of Enemy Allens and Enemy Property.” I would
suggest for your consideration that the Attorneys-Gene-
ral present at the Conference should meet and consider
the matter, and submit a report. It is a very technical
matter.- and requires careful consideration in its re-
lationship to the economic clauses of the Peace Treaty,
I propose—
That Item No. 6, “ Treatment of Enemy Aliens and Enemy
Property,” be referred to a sub-committee, consisting of Mr.
Harwell, Sir Elliott Lewis, and the President for considera-
tion, and that it be listed when we are ready to present a
report.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I move—
That Item No. 7, “ {Representation of Forestry Conference
(Imperial,” be referred to a sub-committee, consisting of the
Ministers of Forests of the various States, and Mr. Loughlin,
of New South Wales.
The motion was agreed to.


The PRESIDENT.—Item No. 10, “Per capita sub-
sidy to States by Commonwealth,” has also been listed
by the Commonwealth, and it can be taken more com-
pletely after the Prime Minister has spoken to us on
financial matters. Among the Commonwealth items
listed is ‘ ‘ Finance—Review of .whole financial arrange-
ments between Commonwealth and States, with special
reference to per capita subsidy.” 1 take it that our
attitude is that we stand firm. I would suggest that
items No. 11 to 15, with the exception of item No. 14—
‘‘Telegraphic correspondence between Premiers: Use
of a more convenient code,” which is really an office
matter on which the Premiers’ officers might he asked
to prepare and submit a report, be referred to a sub-
committee. The items deal with “ Railway passes to
members’ relatives—Question of further extension;”
“Railway passes for life to ex-Federal Ministers
—Question whether payment is to be made by
Commonwealth or States;” “Railway travelling
hy State members on Commonwealth lines;’’ “Vic-
toria Cross holders—Question of free railway passes for
life.” I would suggest that these items be referred to
a sub-committee.
Mr. MITCHELL.—I have pleasure in moving—
That the items mentioned by the President be referred
to a sub-committee, consisting of the Railway Ministers, Mr,
Scaddan, Mr. Ritchie, Mr. Coyne, Mr. Lang, and Mr. Hean.
Mr. HARWELL seconded the motion, which was
agreed to.
MARKING OF AUSTRALIAN-MADE GOODS.
The Conference then discussed Item No. I—“ Australian-made1 —“Austra-
lian-made Goods, Marking of.”
Mr. FIHELLY.—The consideration of this subject
hae been suggested by Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia. I movei—
That uniform legislation be introduced by all the States on
the basis of the Victorian law.
If the motion is carried, the different State Parliaments
could adopt the Victorian law almost word for word.
That would, I believe, secure the object which we hope
to attain. Unless some delegate has objections or defi-
nite views to the contrary, I think the motion might
be accepted without any further discussion. I do not
know whether all the Premiers present have had the
advantage of going through the Victorian law. It is an
excellent piece of legislation. Ido not know who is
responsible for drafting it. Certainly it would suit the
ideas of the Queensland Government almost to the
letter, and I think I can guarantee that, as far as our
Parliament is concerned, it would adopt it as it
stands.
Mr. COYNE. —I have pleasure in seconding the
motion.
The PRESIDENT. —I may explain that the purport
of the Victorian law is to require that, in addition to
the ordinary trade description, goods shall be branded
with the country of origin. I do not know that our
law is complete in all respects, but it is a considerable
step forward. We are now about to promulgate regu-
lations under the law. There was some difficultly in get-
ting out the regulations, but they will be submitted to
the Executive Council shortly. I think I can safely
commend the Victorian law to my fellow Premiers.
The idea underlying it is that the people shall know
where the goods which they are buying are manufac-'
tured. The Act applies to all such goods as are pre-
scribed, and the list may be extended or limited as
may be found desirable by Orders in Council. I may
also explain for the benefit of those Governments which
may be considering the question of bringing in this
legislation, that there are certain provisions in the new
Health Act which was passed by the Victorian Parlia-
ment last session that deal with the matter to some
extent, and we will be promulgating regulations under
that Act shortly. On© is the complement of the other,
and I mention the fact for the benefit of those who
may he drafting the legislation.
Eir WALTER LEE.—In marking goods with the
place of origin, is it necessary to declare the city and
State where they are manufactured 1
The PRESIDENT.—The country of origin.
Mr. HARWELL. —Is it not a matter rather for the
Commonwealth 1
Mr. FIHELLY. —Goods which are half cotton and
half wool may he imported, and they must be marked
to that effect under the Commerce Act. But once they
leave bond, they may be marked in any way whatever.
Therefore, the question is connected with that of giving
further powers to the Commonwealth. The Federal
powers are very restricted, and, in the opinion of tlie
Queensland Government, the States might well adopt
some legislation on Victorian lines. I need not
expatiate in regard to the Commonwealth powers, but
the unfortunate part of it is that imported goods, once
they leave the ship or bond, may be re-marked in any
way, and what is half wool and half cotton can be
called pure wool. In Queensland we have no legisla-
tion dealing with that matter. Of course, we have
complete power to legislate in the direction of curing
that evil, but we want something on the Victorian lines,
and the legislation in all the States should be uniform.
If it were not it would be quite useless, for New South
Wales goods could go across the border into Queens-
land or Victoria and be sold there without being pro-
perly marked.
The PRESIDENT. —There is a certain measure of
control at the Customs, and the Commonwealth can
require that imported goods shall be branded in a
certain way, but when they are through the Customs
the brands'can be removed. We fill in that space.
Whatever the Commonwealth have authority to re-
quire at the Customs we fill in, so far as the sale of
the goods within the State is concerned. We make
an attempt to enlighten the community in that way.
It is an attempt to encourage the purchase of our own
goods, and our Act is the complement of the Common-
wealth Act.
Mr. STOREY. —This seems to me to be an im-
portant matter, and one that might very well be com-
mended to the consideration of the Commonwealth
Government.
Mr. FIHELLY. —They have no power unless we
give them the power.
The PRESIDENT. —They cannot deal with the
matter under their present constitutional powers. The
Commonwealth power stops at the Customs. They
have no control over domestic trade and commerce,
and this is in the sphere of domestic trade and com-
merce. It is a State matter.
Mr. STOREY. —Do I understand that the Victorian
Parliament has pow'er to so legislate as to prevent any
person re-marking an article after it has left the Cus-
toms? How would you propose to meet the case of
a Victorian manufacturer who makes clothes for New
South Wales and labels them with an American brand?
The PRESIDENT. —Our Act is designed to cover
that. It has not been tested in actual operation yet,
because the regulations under it have not been promul-
gated, but no doubts have been suggested by the Crown
Law authorities to the Government as to the efficiency
of the law. I think such legislation is quite right. It
assists the sale of our own goods, and is an extension
of the principle of preventing skim milk masquerading
as cream.


Mr- HARWELL. —It is practically an extension of
the Commonwealth Act to goods sold within , the
States.
The PRESIDENT.—-Yes, in regard to branding
goods with the name of the, country of origin.
Mr. BYBWPPP.—I think uniformity is desirable,
We have in South iVugtrsilia a Trade Marfes Apt, but
it is somewhat out of date, and I think that the pro-
visions of the Victorian Act will meet with the ap-
proval of South Australia. We are quite prepared
to repeal our Act, and to proceed on the lines of the
Victorian Act,
Sip WALTER LEE, —The legislation itself and the
idea a f bringing about, uniformity commend themselves
to me, hut I understood the President to say that the
goods to he dealt with have to. he specified by regula-
tion or proclamation. In order to make the legisla-
tion quite effective it would be necessary to have unL
formity in the regulations. If that is not done, in
one State an article could not he put upon the market
without being properly branded, and in another State
it might be put upon the market in an adulterated
form. Unless there is uniformity in the regulations
the purpose of the Act itself will not be achieved.
Mr. PIHELLY.—I think Sir Walter Lee is right.
That brings us to the point that we must eventually
give the Commonwealth the full power.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am not prepared to admit
that at present. lam open to grgnment, hpt I feel
sure that if so much has to he dealt with by regulation
there will have to. be uniformity in the regulations to
make the legislation effective.
The PRESIDENT. —If we agreed to recommend
that the various State Governments introduce uniform
legislation, the regulations would have to he put on a
uniform basis in order to get symmetrical administra-
tion, but members of the Conference will understand
why it is desirable in some cases not to be bound down
by exact descriptions being put in the Statute.
The ways of some traders are pretty difficult to under-
stand, and if certain goods were specifically mentioned
in the Act it might not he possible to deal with some
methods that would he put into operation for the
purpose of defeating the law. Put we could deal with
the matter by regulation.
Mr. HARWELL. —Haw are we going to secure uni-
formity with regard to regulations made under the
Act ?
The PRESIDENT. —Our regulations will be going
forward, and copies can he forwarded to all the Go-
vernments. Subsequently views oau be exchanged as
to the necessary methods. However, we are affirm-
ing now the principle of uniform State legislation in
this matter, and I presume that uniformity in regula-
tion naturally follows.
The motion was agreed to.
COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL DISABILITIES
IMPOSED ON STATE MEMBERS.
Mr. EIHELLY. —I may say in August, when the
Queensland Parliament meets, we propose to introduce a
Bill almost entirely on the Tasmanian law, which enables
State members to he candidates at Federal elections
without forfeiting their seats in the State Parliament.
Under the Federal Constitution a member of a State
Parliament must resign his seat at least fourteen days
before the issue of the writs for the Federal elections.
That is unfair to State members, and we intend to pass
legislation to remove this disability before the middle
of September. We are fortunate in Queensland in
having a majority in both Houses, so that we can
guarantee the passing of this legislation. I think the
other States might take a similar course.
The PRESIDENT. —Perhaps Sir Walter Lee will
explain to this Conference the ingenious device of the
Tasmanian Government for defeating the Common-
wealth law.
Sir WALTER LEE. —We adopted the legislation to
which Mr. Fihelly has referred because we considered
that a man who has served for some time in the State
Parliament has gained a measure of experience in poli-
tical life and ought, therefore, other things being equal,
to be a fit and proper person to represent the State in
the National Parliament if he should desire to do so.
The Commonwealth legislation has been designed to
make that impossible; and, after giving the matter a
great deal of consideration, we devised a scheme where-
by a member of the State Parliament desirous of con-
testing a Federal seat may give notice to the Governor
that he proposes to do so, and he requests that the issue
of the writ for the vacancy which may he caused if he
is elected to the Federal. Parliament he deferred until
after the Federal election takes place. In the event of
the member being defeated in the Federal contest he
automatically takes his seat again in the State House.
Of course, there is the issue of a writ for the State
member’s seat, but his re-election is largely a formality,
and he takes his seat in the State Parliament again.
We have found the law work out very well, and the
result has been to give general satisfaction. I may
say that, on one occasion, before this law was in force,
several members of the Tasmanian Parliament con-
tested Federal seats and were defeated. Incidentally,
they were also defeated in endeavouring to regain their
seats in the State Parliament. I had no occasion to
complain, because it turned my majority of one into
a majority of about ten, so that it was very convenient
for me.. It seems to me that the law we have passed is
one which gives fair play to State members, and I aw
glad that Queensland is following our example, I also
notice that the Federal Parliament is following an-
other hint which we recently gave, so that we have the
satisfaction of knowing that Tasmania again leads, in
np-to-date and progressive legislation. I have just
been reminded that there is one point I ought to refer
to, and that is the fact that in Tasmania we have pro-
portional representation, under the Hare-Olarke system.
It will he seen, therefore, that the system we have de-
vised in regard to Federal elections is all the more neces-
sary because, in the event of a member retiring to con-
test a Federal seat and being defeated, it may interfere
with the proportional representation if he could not re-
sume his State membership- Supposing the majority
of the electors vote National, the result of a hy-electioav
would obviously he the return of another National
member, and in this way the proportional system would
bo interfered with. It was really to overcome this
difficulty that we devised the scheme in Tasmania to
enable a State member to contest a Federal election
without first of all forfeiting his seat in the State Legis-
lature. I understand that the proportional system does
not prevail in Queensland.
Mr. FIHELLY.—No, we have a better one.
Sir WALTER should like to debate that
statement, but tbis is not a convenient time to do it.
It was because by-elections would destroy proportional
representation that we decided to pass the law to which
Mr. Fihelly has referred. At any rate, it was one of
the reasons.
The PRESIDENT.—I lake it that Mr. Fihelly’s
proposal is that the matter should be referred to the
various State Governments for their consideration.
Mr. EIHELLY. —It is really a hint to the Govern-
ments of the States, coming from Tasmania.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Is this matter the subject of a
Commonwealth law or is it part of the Constitution?


Sir WALTER LEE.—It is a law of the Common-
wealth Parliament.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Then we ought to ask the Com-
monwealth to amend their law.
Sir WALTER LEE.—They will not do that.
Mr. FIHELLY.—A Labour Conference passed a re-
solution at one time recommending- the alteration of
the law while a Labour Government was in power, hut
even then nothing was done. Ido not think we can
do anything except adopt this hint from Tasmania
with the approval of Queensland.
The PRESIDENT.—We could pass a, motion ask-
ing the Commonwealth Government to consider the
repeal of this particular provision.
Mr. SCADDAN. —We could do that, and if they de-
clined to act on that suggestion, then we could go ahead
in the State Parliaments.
Mr. FIHELLY.—We are introducing our legislation
in August, and that will settle the matter so far as we
are concerned.
Mr. STOREY.—I think we might follow the sug-
gestion Mr. Fihelly has given us. It is useless to ask
the Commonwealth Parliament to alter their law. They
will not do that to enable us to become candidates
against them.
Mr. FIHELLY.—It means too much competition.
Mr. STOREY.—It is not so much that, as having a
superior article against them; at least, I think so. It
would be so much waste time to ask the Commonwealth
to alter their law, and We may well adopt the suggestion
which Mr. Fihelly has made. We should adopt this
suggestion in order to defeat the Federal Government
and give the country the benefit of having in the
National Parliament those members of the State Par-
liament who care to offer their services. I feel that
way, and I hope I will be excused for saying so. Ido
not wish to- be offensive to my Federal brothers. The
Commonwealth Parliament have passed laws to prevent
others from infringing on their preserves. When a
letter ie written by a State member to a Commonwealth
Department, the reply is sent through the Federal mem-
ber for the district. The reply is sent through some
one who has had nothing to do with the matter involved.
It strikes me that it would he absurd to expect them to
alter a Federal law to allow us to be competitors against
them. I think we might follow the suggestion made by
Mr. Fihelly. Our electoral officer, Mr. Pennington,
suggests 1 that we might follow the ingenious method
employed by Tasmania. That State appears to he able
to get over any difficulty. Their method is the easiest,
and the only likely one. I hold the view that we State
people are too much inclined to approach the Federal
people to ask for concessions. Ido not think we should
ask them whether they will allow us humble individuals
to stand for the Federal Parliament. I disagree with
the law that they passed.
Mr, SCADDAN. —If you never ask for a thing, it is
not likely to be granted.
Mr. STOREY.—No doubt the honorable member has
discovered that one has risked asking for something
many a time, and, to his surprise, it has come off, but
I do not think there is the slightest chance of getting
the Federal people to allow us to be competitors with
them. '
Mr. FIHELLY.—We are all in a very impartial posi-
tion, for any State Minister can retain his portfolio,
and resign his seat. As a matter of fact. I know a
Minister who remained a member of the Executive
Council for some time after he had been elected to the
Federal Parliament,
Mr. SCADDAN. —I know a Minister who- had a port-
folio before he was elected.
Mr. FIHELLY, —That is a very simple matter, for
the King' can appoint any one, and a Minister can hold
his portfolio after he has been defeated,
Mr. STOREY.—The main idea of the Federal mem-
bers in making that provision was to prevent State
members with free passes having an advantage over
them.
Mr. FIHELLY.—The Commonwealth Government,
by Sir William Lyne’s direction, arranged for the Com-
monwealth member and his wife to have a free pass.
A Minister can hold a seat in the Federal Parliament,
and remain a Minister in a State Parliament, if his
party will allow him.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I do not think this matter
should be left where it is, nor do I think that a recom-
mendation should be made to the State Governments to
follow the course that we have adopted in Tasmania.
The Commonwealth Government have placed disabili-
ties on State members. Are we prepared to sit down
under these disabilities, and make no effort to have them
removed ? There is nothing infra dig. in the Conference
making a recommendation urging that the disabilities
be removed, and that we should have the right to con-
test Federal seats if we desire. If they turn the matter
down, we shall be in the position that Mr. Fihelly has
referred to. We should certainly ask them to remove
all disabilities placed on State members.
Mr. COYNE.—What limit of time would you give
them to accomplish it 1
Sir WALTER LEE. —That is a matter for each State
Government to determine. We ought to ask the Com-
monwealth fcroverament to do it. Ido not think that
we should be in the position in which we are. We
should try to get the Commonwealth Government to
alter the situation, and a request to that effect should
be made by the Conference. If not, each Government
should act on its own.
The PRESIDENT.—I think we should pass a motion
stating that the Conference invites the Commonwealth
and the States to consider the question of the disabili-
ties placed on members of the Commonwealth and the
State Parliaments in connexion with the contesting of
seats. There is a disability in this State that prevents
a State member from standing for the Commonwealth
Parliament, and so we, in our Parliament, have said
that a Commonwealth member shall not have the oppor-
tunity of confecting a seat for our Parliament. If the
disabilities are to he removed, they should be removed
on both sides. I think that the Commonwealth and
the State Governments should be asked to consider the
matter, and if an agreement is not arrived at, the
attention of the various State Governments should be
directed to the action taken by Tasmania.
Mr. MITCHELL. —I think we ought to let the Com-
monwealth Government clearly understand that, if they
do not grant the concession we desire, we shall have to
take steps similar to those taken by Tasmania. I think
the disability ought to he removed. It is not so much
a question of a member himself as of the people, who
should have the widest possible choice. Undoubtedly
this is the case with regard to a State, and more par-
ticularly a small State. However, I move—
That the Commonwealth Government he asked to amend
their law so as to make it possible for any person, whilst
remaining a member of the State Parliament, to he a candi-
date for the Federal Parliament, and, failing that, that the
States be requested to amend their law so as to effect this
purpose, in the same way as is done under the Tasmanian
law.
Mr. RITCHIE.—I second the motion. South Aus-
tralia is in a similar position to what, I understood the
President to say, Victoria is in. lam not quite sure,
but I think legislation exists in South Australia whereby
a Federal member is not eligible to hold a State seat,
and that, I think, took rise just after the confirmation
of Federation, when a number of Federal representa-
tives who were then representing- South Australia in
the Federal Parliament still retained their seats in
the State Parliament.


Mr. FIHELLY.—As a matter of fact, they collected
both salaries.
Mr. RITCHIE.—That is, I believe, a perfectly cor-
rect statement. The State Parliament was moved to
introduce legislation to prevent any overlapping of that
kind. I think the better course to follow is, first to
approach the Prime Minister, and, if that doe’s not re-
sult in the wishes of the Conference being met, the
matter should be taken in hand by the State Govern-
ments.
The motion was agreed to.
MURRAY RIVER SETTLEMENTS—MARKET
FOR PRODUCE FROM.
Mr. LAFFER.—Item No. 8, dealing with the ques-
tion of a market for produce from the Murray River
Settlements, is of very great importance to the State
of South Australia. The question has been raised
very largely in consequence of the great number of
soldiers we are placing upon Murray lands. I have a
return here prepared by the Irrigation Department,
showing that, when the works at present in progress
are completed, there will be provision for 9,581
settlers. The upper reaches of the Murray, which is
the portion that is being affected by the locks, is very
largely a vine-growing proposition; and I want to place
before members of the Conference the position as far
as the fruit industry is concerned. During the war
period, and up till two or three years ago, I am, I
think, safe in saying that at least 25 per cent, of the
currants, 25 per cent, of the sultanas, and 50 per cent,
of the Gordo Blanco raisins produced had to be disposed
of outside the ordinary channels of consumption, To
a large extent they went, to the distilleries, and were
distilled into spirits. The question of the extension
of markets for this produce- has been raised by the
officers of the Department, and we anticipate settling
at least 2,000 soldiers on the River Murray, most of
whom will he engaged in the growing of fruit. It will
be principally dried fruit, though we are establishing
a canning factory in connexion with the settlement.
This question affects New South Wales and Victoria in
the same way as it affects South Australia, and it is
felt very stronglv that some effort should he made to
extend the dried-fruit markets. As regards the condi-
tions under which the fruits are being produced, the
highest wages are, of course, being paid. Arrangements
are being entered into by the ordinary settlers with
the Australian Workers Union, and the rates of pay
are in accordance with the union log. It means that
under ordinary conditions we could not compete in the
world s markets with our dried fruit, and it was felt
by the Planting Committee charged with the duty of
planting the soldiers’ blocks, that the Commonwealth
authority should be asked, not only to secure, if pos-
provision for the extension of our markets, hut
to bring about reciprocity between British communities
in the Pacific. I think we all realize that to some
extent the war has brought the British peoples more
closely together, and if the Commonwealth authorities
would take this matter up, and seek to ob-
tain reciprocity between the British communities, it
would help ns very considerably in finding a market for
these products. Now the position we are faced with
to-day is this —It was necessary to have those blocks
planted to enable the men to get a living, and here is
the difficulty which confronts us; We are planting
a portion of almost every block, unless a man has con-
scientious objections, with grape vines for distillation
purposes, and our Government has assisted to establish
distilleries. That will he extended in future. It was
felt by the Land Settlement Committee that there
should be a guarantee by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. that the men should not. be penalized if pro-
hibition were brought in. Prohibition would mean
that the whole of the distillation grape vines would
have to be worked over and grafted, in order to pro-
duce grapes for drying purposes, such as currants and
sultanas. That would mean that there would be abso-
lute chaos unless markets were provided. This is an
opportune time to discuss the matter, now that the
Tariff is under consideration. Tf the markets are
extended we could make provision, not only for a large
number of soldiers, but for civilian settlers as well.
The Commonwealth and the States are spending mil-
lions of pounds in locking the Murray, and if the ex-
penditure of that money is to be justified, it means
that the water available must be utilized in connexion
with irrigation. It is a matter of grave importance in
connexion with the development of the river. I have
not yet drafted a resolution, hut I should like the Con-
ference to adopt something on these lines: “ That the
Commonwealth Government be asked to consider the
question of extending the markets for Australian dried
fruits.” And I would suggest that reciprocity he
entered into with British communities, especially in
the Pacific. This is a matter on which I think the
Tasmanian delegates might have something to say.
When I was in Tasmania I was told that the export
of apples to South America rose from 5,000 to 100,000
eases in four years. At present we are in a position
to export to various countries; hut when normal con-
ditions return we shall he faced with the same posi-
tion as we were in before the war.
Mr. COYNE.—I presume that most of the States
are practically in the same position as South Australia.
We have a great number of men on some of our settle-
ments in Queensland. Our principal settlement is
Beerburrum. We have now exhausted the market
available, and each year we are producing more fruit
there. Next year we expect to produce 400,000 cases
of pineapples. Then we have a large number of soldier
settlers on the Atherton tableland, in North Queens-
land, where we expect to be able to produce 10,000
tons of maize. In the Stanthorpe district also, we
have a large number of returned men. There we
expect to produce considerably more apples, peaches,
and such fruits than we can find a market for at the
present time. In my opinion, it is the duty of the
Commonwealth Government to see that markets are
found overseas for the produce raised by returned sol-
diers. The Commonwealth can do that more effec-
tively than the States. With all the co-operation
imaginable the States could not do it as well, because
the Commonwealth Government have the shipping;
and' if they wish they can allocate a certain number
of vessels to carry the produce of returned soldiers to
markets overseas. I think the Commonwealth should
take the matter up; and I think it is the duty of the
Conference to impress that view on the Eederal repre-
sentative. I quite agree with the South Australian
Minister in everything he has said. His remarks apply
to Tasmania and Queensland and all the other States.
We now have men engaged in intensive cultivation in
a way which has never been attempted before in Aus-
tralia. It has been necessary to provide soldier settlers
with sufficient areas to enable them to make a decent
living for themselves. In that way we are producing
more of those particular products than we anticipated
previously, or we had a market for. Therefore it seems
to me that we should ask for the hearty co-operatiou
of the Commonwealth with the States in this matter,
and I have much pleasure in supporting the proposal.
Mr. LANG.—While one does not desire to raise
objection to what is proposed, I wish to emphasize
the point that those responsible for soldier settlement
should first of all exploit our own home markets.
Whatever may he the reasons, the fact remains that
the people of Australia do not get a proper fruit sup-
ply. In Sydney, or any of the country towns of New


South Wales, the people cannot get the fruit they
require. Very often it is not available at any price,
and when it is available the price is higher than the,
people can afford. I hope we will not be diverted from
the necessity of providing our own people with fruit.
This is a matter which we have to look at from two
points of view. First of all, we must make a success
of soldier settlement; but we cannot overlook the
interests of the consumers, on whom we must rely for
the disposal of the produce, and who should be able
to get fruit at a fair and reasonable price. If the
fruit is disposed of in our home markets, freightage
and the cost of organization, and a great deal of other
trouble will be saved. Therefore, before proceeding
with any such scheme as is proposed, I wish to empha-
size the necessity of supplying our local market first.
The PRESIDENT.—I take it, Mr. Laffer, that your
proposal is supplemental to local market 0
Mr. LAFFER.—It seems to me that the last speaker
has got entirely off the track, if I may say so. Before
the war, with all the markets of Australia open to us,
we in iSouth Australia had to dispose of 25 per cent,
of our currants, 25 per cent, of our sultanas, and 50
per cent, of our raisins outside the ordinary channels
of consumption. I think the Victorian delegates will
back me up when I say that the Australian Dried
Fruits Association are carrying on extensive propaganda
work. They put thousands of pounds into advertising
dried fruits, and they are doing their utmost to put
those fruits into the consumers’ hands.
Mr. COYNE.—In Australia, too.
Mr. LAFFER.—In Australia. But this is a bigger
question. It is a question of insuring those men who
are being settled on the land a living. W© must have
markets for dried fruits, otherwise the soldier settle-
ments will be handicapped very much. I move—
That this Conference urge the Commonwealth Government
to do its utmost to extend the markets, particularly for dried
fruit, and would suggest that reciprocity with other British
countries in the Pacific should, if possible, be secured.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am very loth to say any-
thing that would appear to be in opposition to the
desires of the South Australian representatives, but I
must say that I quite fail to see how this Conference
of State Premiers can conscientiously ask the Common-
wealth Government to take up the matter of the finding
of markets for the produce that is grown in the various
States —in this instance, one particular commodity
that is grown in South Australia. If we were to do
that, would it not be reasonable to expect that each
of the States would ask the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to do likewise with its primary products?
Mr. COYNE.—With the surplus.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Yes. The same argument
might be put forward in connexion with apples. W©
do not expect the Commonwealth Government to go out
and exploit the fruit markets for the benefit of the
apple grower. To some extent I am in agreement with
the New South Wales Minister who spoke with regard
to the exploiting of our own market. Most of these
commodities are at a very high price in the States to-
day, and are entirely out of the reach of many of the
people of the Commonwealth because of the price. I
attended a smoke social a little while ago in Hobart,
in connexion with the big Inter-State fruit show that
was held there, and one of the speakers, referring to
the price of apples in Hobart, facetiously remarked that
they were only within the reach of ship-owners and
wharf labourers. He intended to imply that the price
of apples was very high, although we grow such a tre-
mendous quantity of them in Tasmania, but I do not
think that Tasmania should seriously ask the Common- 1
wealth Government to open up markets for our apples.
It seems to me primarily the duty of the State to do
that. It is put forward that the motion is in the in-
terests of the soldier settlers, and again it seems to me
that it is somewhat dangerous to ask the Commonwealth
Government to take up that form of work. It seems
to me a matter for a State Government to see that the
men within its own territory, growing a particular
article suitable to that territory, are able to find a
market for their produce, and it should not expect the
Commonwealth to do that. I venture to say that, be-
fore the Conference finishes, there will be some very
strong comments made about the Commonwealth
Government interfering in State activities. ' We are
now inviting them to come in, and if we invite them
to come in in one direction, will it not be logical for
them to say: “If yon want us to come in to one thing
why do you object to our coming in to other things ?”
I am loth to oppose the motion, but the matter is
hardly one that w© should ask the Federal Government
to take up.
Mr. STOREY. —I take the same view as the Premier
of Tasmania with regard to this matter. I would sug-
gest to the mover of the motion that, if he wants a
market for the dried fruits produced in his State, New
South Wales will undertake to take all he can send
along. X venture to say further that it is the general
opinion in New South Wales, and has been the opinion
of leading politicians there, that we do not want the
Federal Government to “butt in” and interfere in these
things at all. We have taken the view that it would
be very much better if they allowed kindred subjects
to the one now under consideration to be dealt with
entirely by the State, What good can the Federal
Government do us in a matter of this sort ? Surely we
have not exploited the Australian markets in the sale
of our fruits. I heard what Mr. Coyne said as to what
Queensland is doing in connexion with the growing of
pineapples, but I venture to say that you would not
find a Queensland pineapple from one end of New
South Wales to the other. It is now suggested that the
Federal Government should step in, but what must be
said of the people in the States where these fruits are
grown if they will not send them just across the border
into another State ? To suggest for a moment that the
Australian market has been exploited with regard to
dried fruits,' or any other kind of fruits, is to suggest
something that is not in accordance with New South
Wales experience at any rate. lam ready to join with
those people whom the Premier of Tasmania spoke of
as saying that fruit is difficult to get in Tasmania. On
one occasion I was in Tasmania for a month, and I
looked about for the beautiful Tasmanian apples of
which I had heard. When I saw the apples on sale
in the shops I came to the conclusion that all the good
apples must be sent to other parts of the world. Why
should we ask that our beautiful fruits, either dried
or otherwise, should be sent away to other parts of the
world when it cannot, by the widest stretch of imagina-
tion, be said that even the fringe of the Australian
market has been exploited? As I have said, there are
very few pineapples from Queensland coming into New
South Wales, and dried fruits are a rarity there. You
have to pay a very high price for them. There is only
one place I know of where they are sold— a shop in
King Street, Sydney. I venture to say it is quit© im-
possible to get dried fruits anywhere else in New South
Wales. It is impossible for us to think that we have
exploited the Australian markets, and, therefore, in
my opinion, it would be injudicious to do anything in
the direction suggested by the motion.
Mr. FIHELLY.—This is a matter in regard to
which we come once more to the State and the Federal
powers. The matter is entirely in Commonwealth
hands, and there is no doubt that we must give the
Government wider powers. The trade in
| dried fruits is controlled mostly by Victoria, and we


had an intimation from those controlling the industry
that, if we persisted in our anti-profiteering legisla-
tion, they would send no more dried fruits to Queens-
land. It so happens, however, that the people in Vic-
toria use the sugar grown in Queensland, and the
people of Australia, in their generosity, allow us to
grow .sugar. _ We claim the right to fix the price of
commodities in the State I represent. That, however,
slightly irrelevant, hut the fact remains that we must
give the Federal Parliament more powers in this re-
spect, Let us look at the position in regard to wool.
In the year 1912 there were about 95,000,000 sheep
in Australia, and the wool clip brought about
£21,000,000, In the year 1914-15 there was a reduc-
tion of 25 per cent, in the number of sheep, while the
wool clip returned approximately- £50,000,000. We
are in the habit of exporting commodities like
wool and then having to buy hack the manu-
factured article; consequently, there should be some
authority to deal with outside markets in the
disposal of the surplus of our primary products.
We should manufacture our own clothing material,
and, in the same way, we should also fulfil our
own requirements in the manufacture of leather. In
Queensland we have about 5,000,000 head of cattle,
and yet we import hides from Now Zealand. The
quantity of leather required for the manufacture of
a pair of boots does not cost more than a few shillings,
yet we have to pay extraordinary prices for our boots.
These facts seem to point to the necessity for having
a central authority for dealing with the exportable
surplus of our goods. If necessary, we must impose
an export duty. Members of the Conference will see
that the second item on the agenda-paper, “Australian
industries—encouragement of,” covers the whole gamut
of the argument. We must provide for our own
requirements in Australia before we allow any export
to take place. We have provided for that in Queens-
land so far as meat is concerned. We say we must
have enough meat for the people of our State, and the
same attitude should be taken up with regard to the
people of Australia. We have a law in Queensland
called the Sugar Acquisition Act, and under it we can
seize sugar, and any other commodity. We used to
seize meat and pay 3|d. per lb. for it. The Imperial
Government paid 4fd. for it, and sold it at Is. 2d.,
so they made a good profit out of it. We have now
agreed with the meat companies to take their meat at
3d. per lb. chilled and 3|d. per lb. frozen. But wa
should not confine this question merely to an imaginary
line drawn from the Tweed Eiver to the South Aus-
tralian border. It should be a Federal matter. I
am glad the discussion has taken place, and I am not
going to oppose the motion at all.
Mr. FRANK CLARKE.—The motion on the
notice-paper deals with dried fruits grown along the
Murray, and it is also proposed to bring in Queensland
pineapples and other apples.
Mr. COYNE.—If the motion were to refer to the
exportable surplus I should be satisfied.
Mr, FRANK CLARKE.—The position, from the
Victorian stand-point more particularly, in regard to
dried fruits is that there is a great demand for all the
dried fruits produced at the present time. Looking
ahead for a number of years, even with the present
world uncertainty, it can be said that private enter-
prise will deal with the whole of the canned products
Australia is likely to turn out, even after we have
settled all the soldiers who desire to go in for this
particular industry. Ido not think any special efforts
will be required to find markets for canned products.
In regard to dried grapes, in the form of currants,
lexias, and sultanas, the position is, admittedly, diffi-
cult. At the present time we produce about 12,000
tons of dried grapes per annum, Th e Australian
Dried Fruits Association was formed some years ago
with the object of regulating the price and the output,
, I believe, but I am not quite certain about it, that, in
addition, the association also endeavoured to regulate
the supply by carrying over the crop in the fruitful years
so as to meet with a possible shortage in lean years.
Admittedly, the operations of the association were in
the interests of the grower. The result was that the
people in Australia got their dried grapes in various
forms at a pretty set price, and that the rate was
fairly high. In recent years, however, the world’s
price has gone sky high, and there is an enormous
profit in the export of dried grapes. A certain num-
ber of growers—l cannot help thinking without realiz-
ing their ultimate interest—are breaking away from
the control of the Australian Dried Fruits Associa-
tion, and are insisting on shipping the whole of their
products overseas to get the high prices which are ruling
there. The Australian Dried Fruits Association very
properly fears that, if this action results in the export
of the whole of the output of Australia in dried grapes,
the Federal Government will step in and deprive
growers of the existing protective Tariff. There is
no doubt that the high rates on the other side of the
world are immensely attractive to Australian growers,
and that the continuation of export will leave Aus-
without a reasonable supply of dried grapes.
If this result is brought about, the Federal Govern-
ment would certainly have some argument that there
ought not any longer to he any protection for this
industry. When we have settled the soldiers along the
Murray, we shall have in the course of the next five
years a surplus over and above Australian require-
ments of something like 37,000 tons of dried grapes,
and it will certainly be a problem how we are going to
get a market for that surplus. There are two ways
of looking at this matter. The Federal .and the State
Governments might jointly deal with it by looking out
for fresh markets. The other way would be for the
growers, either through co-operation on their own,
part or through the private firms which deal with
these matters, to endeavour to point out suitable
markets abroad. I think it is impossible, with
prices as they are throughout the world, to lay
down a clear indication of what future markets
will be. I think it would be wrong to retain the
second part of the motion, in regard to reciprocity.
The Federal Government would reply that we have
reciprocity with British Possessions, and that it has
been granted for a number of years. It might be wise
to cut out that part, asking the Federal Government to
go in_ for reciprocity with British peoples. I have
explained the position in regard to dried grapes. Ido
not think we need fear with regard to other fruits for
a number of years. Tasmania will probably tell us
that the apple trade has been thoroughly and well
developed, and that no Government intervention could
improve the export trade. I would urge that the word-
ing of the motion as to reciprocity with other British
peoples be omitted. We have preference already.
The PRESIDENT.—We have had a pretty full dis-
cussion on the motion submitted, and we have done
some service in regard to finding additional markets,
especially for dried fruits, in connexion with soldier
settlement. I have drafted a motion that will har-
monize the conflicting views expressed, and achieve the
purpose of drawing attention to the necessity of finding
markets, and will fittingly invite the co-operation of
the Commonwealth Government in that respect. They
have their own shipping line, and might well co-operate
with us. I would suggest to Mr. Laffer that he should
adopt the following motion:—
That, in view of the large additional quantity of fruit,
particularly raisins and currants, that is likely to be pro-
duced as the result of soldier settlement, the Oommonwealth


Government be asked to co-operate with the State Govern-
ments in finding outside markets for all surplus fruit products.
Mr. LAFFER. —I approve of that motion, Mr. Presi-
dent, and will accept it as a substitute for mine.
The motion was agreed to.
CUSTOMS DUTY OR GOODS IMPORTED BY
STATE GOVERNMENTS.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWlS.—Since we met here to-day,
a letter has been placed in the hands of members. It
has a very important bearing on the question of
Customs duty on goods imported by State Governments.
Certain resolutions have been passed by a Conference
of the Commissioners of Railways of the various States
and the Commonwealth, which recently met in Mel-
bourne. Those resolutions are —
1. That in the opinion of the Commissioners in Conference
ad valorem duty should not be levied in respect of materials
not manufactured in Australia which are required for the
construction of rolling-stock; and
2. That duty should not be collected on materials required
for the construction of rolling-stock which were ordered from
abroad prior to the levying of the present duty, for the reason
that sufficient quantities of such materials of Australian manu-
facture were unprocurable.
I was not aware that these resolutions had been
passed until we met this afternoon. They deal with
a principle that I wish to impress on the Conference.
I desire the co-operation of all the States in this matter.
At present, it is absolutely necessary for all the States,
and particularly for Tasmania, to import a large amount
of machinery in connexion with industries and projects
on foot. I am not prepared to deal with the question
of railways in particular; but I may say that in Tas-
mania we are importing a very large amount of machi-
nery for hydro-electric purposes. That machinery will
be used in many industries, and will be applied to pro-
duction in many different directions. We have to
import this machinery from America. It is not
procurable even in England. High-tension electrical
machinery is only procurable in America, and possibly
in Sweden. As far as Sweden is concerned, I under-
stand that all that can be manufactured there is used
locally. One of the big manufacturing concerns in
America —the British Electric Company—is, I under-
stand, considering now the extension and erection of
plant in England to manufacture this particular class
of machinery. We are. therefore, driven to- procure
this machinery from America, and we have not only
a very serious rate of exchange against us, but we have
also the heavy Customs duties which have been imposed
by the Federal Government, and which have been re-
cently very largely increased. To explain the position
in a very few words: Last year we imported £26,000
worth of hydro-electric machinery, and had to pay a
duty of £5,500 on that. This year we have placed
orders for £250,000 worth of machinery, which will be
arriving during the calendar year, and we have to pay
£60,000 in Customs duties on that machinery. Now,
that is going to add to the capital cost of the machinery
and of the hydro-electric works, and the increase will
have to be passed on to the consumers of the hydro-
electric energy, so it is increasing the cost of the pro-
duction of those particular products that will result
from the use of this energy. Our producers will there-
fore be handicapped to that extent by the action of
the Federal Government in imposing a duty upon goods
which cannot be produced in Australia, and probably
will not be produced here within very many years, as
the demand for them is not sufficient. As I have ex-
plained, even in England the demand is not sufficient.
In Europe, excepting Sweden and possibly Norway,
the demand is not sufficient to warrant any of these
companies erecting the necessary plant for the manu-
facture of this machinery. Then we are handicapped
in this way; We have had to be quite sure that we have
customers, and customers for large amounts of power.
We have entered into contracts believing that the Cus-
toms duties would not be increased on these particular
importations, and we shall find ourselves in the unfor-
tunate position that the contracts will have to be car-
ried out and we shall be supplying the energy at less
than it is costing us. We have gone on the idea that
these works will be self-supporting, that they will pay
not only the generating expenses, but the interest and
a proper depreciation, and we shall he so handicapped
that we shall not be able to carry on these works at the
remunerative rates we expected from them. Then,
again, it must be remembered—and this is rather an
important factor—that while we are raising the money,
which we have to borrow at a high rate of interest, the
Customs duties go into the ordinary Federal revenue
and are expended in the ordinary administrative and
other costs of the Federal Government. We are there-
fore borrowing money in order to pay the current ex-
penses of the Federal Government. This £60,000 which
we shall have to borrow this year to pay in Customs
duties on these items alone will all go into the Com-
monwealth general revenue. We are, in fact, borrow-
ing money to increase the' revenue of the Common-
wealth. If a State borrowed money to nay its own
interest bill, or to pay its own administrative expenses,
that State would be looked upon as in a parlous condi-
tion and as going headlong to bankruptcy. But be-
cause the States borrow the money to pay into the
Commonwealth revenue, that apparently is regarded as
sound finance. These are some of the questions that
are troubling us at the present time, and our position
must be typical of what is taking place in all the other
States. All the States are launching new industries
for which considerable importations of machinery are
necessary. 1 have not as yet prepared any formal
motion, but possibly I can submit on© before the dis-
cussion, if there is a discussion, on this subject is con-
cluded. I do submit, however, that the Federal Go-
vernment should not impose duties on machinery in-
troduced into a State in order to encourage the very
necessary industries which we are all so anxious to pro-
mote.
The PRESIDENT.—It may be as well now to ad-
journ for dinner in order to give Sir Elliott Lewis an
opportunity of submitting the motion when we resume
the discussion.
Mr. SC ADD AN.—Would it not be better to avoid
coming to a decision until we have discussed the rail-
way question 1
Mr. FIHELLY. —I move—
That the debate be adjourned.
The motion for the adjournment of the debate was
agreed to.
COAL CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION.
Mr. BARWELL. —There is a matter of extreme
urgency I wish to mention. It is a matter that has
cropped up quite recently, and, consequently, hasi not
been listed on the agenda paper. It has to do with
the intimation w© have received from the Common-
wealth Government to the effect that they will reliquish
the control of coal. It is a, very serious matter, in-
deed, so far as South Australia is concerned, and I
think, if not equally serious, is at least a very impor-
tant matter so far as Victoria is concerned.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Victoria, Tasmania, and, I
think. Queensland, are concerned.
Mr. BARWELL.—Tasmania has its own coal supply
to a great extent, but South Australia is absolutely
dependent on the sources outside the State, and if the
Commonwealth are going to relinquish control, it will
mean chaos in South Australia. Ido not want to dis-
cuss the matter at the present moment, unless members
of the Conference think this is an opportune time for
bringing it forward.
The PRESIDENT. —You will notice that Item. 26,
under the heading “ Subjects which the Prime Minister
desires to- discuss with the Conference,” relates to coal
9


distribution. If it is the mind of the Conference that
we should put a request to the Commonwealth with
regard to the matter, then we might profitably discuss
it now, and if we com© to a resolution in regard to it,
we shall be able to present that resolution to the Prime
Minister when he attends to-morrow.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Does the item on the agenda
paper mean that the Prime Minister proposes to make
any statement with regard to the matter'!
The PRESIDENT.—No. As a matter of fact, I
think the Secretary to the Conference listed the subject
as one that Victoria wished to have discussed. So far
as I recollect, it was not suggested by the Prime
Minister in his communications with Mr. Storey.. It
shou’d really appear amongst the subjects headed
“States Matters."
Sir WALTER LEE.—I think the matter should bo
discussed now.
The PRESIDENT.—The matter does not concern
New South Wales.
Mr. STOREY.—I do not mind the discussion taking
place now. The Commonwealth have decided to re-
linquish their control of coal distribution. During the
war period they had their Coal Board, and now they
are wanting to get rid of it. There was a leading
article in one of the Melbourne newspapers this morning
referring to the matter.
Mr. EIHELLY.—What does South Australia fear if
the Commonwealth Government does relinquish control ?
Mr. BARWELL. —I think we can discuss the matter
now. I received a day or two ago the following tele-
gram from the Prime Minister: —
Commonwealth Government has decided to immediately re-
linquish control of coal. Question of internal control and
distribution within respective States will consequently become
one for State Government tot determine. Should your
Government contemplate any action in this direction, Com-
monwealth Government will render you all possible assist-
ance. Matter could be conveniently discussed at Premiers’
Conference this week.
South Australia is absolutely dependent upon outside
places for its coal, as there are no coal deposits within
the State which are utilizahle. At present the coal
stocks in South Australia are very low. A deputation
waited upon me only the other day and pointed out
that the industrial life of the State was being seriously
menaced owing to the coal shortage. This deputation,
I may say, waited upon me before I received the in-
timation that the Commonwealth Governmelnt in-
tended to relinquish control. The Secretary of the
Gas Company told me that they had only six days’
supply, and one of the officers of the Railway Depart-
ment intimated that if the trouble at Broken Hill came
to an end at once we would not he able to cope with the
traffic between Port Pirie and Broken Hill, as there
was only eight days’ supply of coal on hand. During
the present financial year the State has lost approxi-
mately £400,000 in freight on the line between Broken
Hill and Port Pirie, so that it will he seen that it is
a serious concern to us for the Barrier trade to be re-
sumed as soon as possible, and in the event of the Broken
Hill Companies being prepared to come to terms with
the men there should be nothing to prevent traffic being
resumed without any delay; yet from the statement of
the railway officials we would not be able to resume that
traffic because of the shortage of coal. If the Com-
monwealth Government carries out its intention the
State would have to control the distribution of coal,
but at present we have no organization for the pur-
pose. For some years past the Commonwealth has
had a Coal Board which has done splendid work, and
in South Australia we feel that there is no reason why
control should be relinquished by the Commonwealth
Government at the present time. Even if the State
were to commence control we probably could not get
the services of the officers who are at present acting on
the Coal Board in South Australia. The Chairman
of the Board in my State is a naval officer Com-
mander Bracegirdle—and unless we can make some ar-
rangement with the Commonwealth (Government to
secure his services our position would not he very
satisfactory. There has been a shortage of coal in
South Australia for a considerable time. The Board,
however, has the whole method of control and distri-
bution at its finger tips, and knows the best way to deal
with this commodity. If control were absolutely
abolished there would be chaos in South Australia.
Everybody would be fighting for his own end, and the
small man would be squeezed out altogether. In this
way various industries would be shut up. Ido not
know what the position is in Victoria, but I presume
it is not so acute as it is in South Australia.
The PRESIDENT.—It is acute enough.
Mr. BARWELL. I expect it is. If control is
placed in the hands of the State it cannot be anything
like as effective for some time, at any rate, as it is now
with the Commonwealth organization. A good deal
of trouble is largely due to the shortage of shipping.
The deputation that waited upon me suggested that I
should make every effort to induce the Commonwealth
Government to assist the State in this regard, and the
only way the Commonwealth could act would be by
diverting some of its ships that are at the present time
earning attractive freights overseas.
Mr. EIHELLY. The control of shipping is the
great thing.
Mr. BARWELL.—The two things are mixed up, and
the matter is very serious. I think we ought to pass
a resolution asking the Prime Minister to continue con-
trol for the time being at any rate.
The PRESIDENT. —Suppose we pass a motion re-
questing the Prime Minister to continue the Coal
Board in existence, and the respective State Govern-
ments pledge their co-operation in the adminstration
of control. Would that be agreeable to you?
Mr. BARWELL. —Yes. There is another aspect
to this matter which affects us seriously, and that is
the bunkering of steamers. That requires a know-
ledge of Inter-State and coastal requirements which the
Coal Board undoubtedly has. If we have no control
there would be no guarantee that steamers could be
bunkered, and the probabilities are that some of the
oversea vessels, like the mail steamers, would go past
Port Adelaide altogether. That would be a very bad
thing for the State. There are, however, many aspects
of this matter, but I do not want to discuss it at any
great length just now. It is desirable the Conference
should declare that in the interests of South Australia
and Victoria, and possibly other States, the control
which has been so effective for some years past should
be continued until things become normal. I will move
in the direction the President suggested.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I quite agree that the position
will be very serious for those States that are dependent
upon outside places for coal if the present control is
suddenly terminated and no other system substituted.
I am not quite sure if some system could not be de-
vised whereby we could, perhaps, have a more efficient
method of control than we have at the present time.
The suggested motion says that the should pledge
their co-operation, and although I do not know what
was in your mind, Mr. President, when you suggested
the motion, it carried a bit further what had been run-
ning through my mind during the day in considering
this subject. It seems to me that what is required
at the present time is that there should be one central
head—say, the Commonwealth Government—and that
in each State there should be a Minister or some other


person set apart to deal with the question of the supply
of coal for each particular State. I think it would be
advisable to have a Minister.
Mr. HARWELL.—In our State the Control Board
deals with it very effectively.
Sir WALTER LEE. —The Commonwealth Govern-
ment are not disposed to continue the system of control,
and I cannot blame them. They have to take all the
odium and the responsibility, and I am not too sure
that there is not some responsibility resting, on the
States to see that their supplies are met. If there were
a responsible Minister in each State to collect infor-
mation, and to be the channel through which requests
for coal should go, he would be able to get from the
head of the Control Board the information as to how
the coal should be distributed to meet the local needs.
That Minister would be on the spot, and would know
what were the most pressing needs, such as the rail-
ways, and would also be able to deal with the question
of household supplies.
Mr. HARWELL.—The existing Boards know that,
and they have had several years of experience. They
are honorary Boards, too.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Yes, I know. In Tasmania,
all our requests have to go to a Commonwealth officer,
He is to a large extent the deciding factor, as he recom-
mends to the Central Board. To all practical intents
and purposes the Naval Commandant is the person to
whom all the requests have to be made. He can only
act on the instructions he receives from head-quarters.
If the State representative were given fairly wide
powers he would be the channel through which all
communications would go, and would determine the
question of the distribution of coal. That would be a
better method than the existing one. I desire to sup-
port the Premier of South Australia in his motion to
provide for a continuation of the control by the Com-
monwealth Government in co-operation with the States.
I do not know how we can co-operate otherwise than
is done at present, namely, by the appointment of
certain gentlemen to the local Board.
Mr. HARWELL.—We have co-operation at present.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am not sure whether it is
effective.
Mr. HARWELL.—It could not be ; more so with us.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I will not say that ours is not
effective, but it seems to me that we lack a little direct
control in the distribution of the coal, and in the
matter of representation to the Central Board. I am
besieged by people who urge me to make direct repre-
sentations to the Board. Why should I do that ? The
Chairman of the Board is under Commonwealth super-
vision, and I contend that it would be better if we
had a State Minister to act with the Federal repre-
sentative.
The PRESIDENT.—The Victorian Government
takes a serious view of the situation that presents itself
in regard to coal supplies. The route of effective con-
trol was in the control of shipping, and the Common-
wealth Government is relinquishing that. The Central
Board had a gentleman on it who acted as the direct
representative ,of the Victorian Government, and he
reported to me from time to time what was being done
and what was the situation as to coal.
Mr. HARWELL.—We have a railway man as our
representative.
The PRESIDENT.—The absence of control means that
there is not necessarily order and method in the distri-
bution. Th© only reason for a Coal Board is the shortage
of supplies. In New South Wales control is unneces-
sary. We have had very great difficulty in maintain-
ing our supplies, and that was especially the case during
the seamen’s strike and the marine engineers’ strike.
We were perilously near the end of our resources. We
have been endeavouring to bring coal overland, but
we have not made much progress in conserving supplies.
We do not know when it may become necessary to
ration supplies. Of course, we have to serve the essen-
tial utilities first. If we had not had some system of
control a great many more industries would have been
closed down during the strikes I have referred to.
Rationing of supplies between States and between indi-
viduals is necessary, and this can be more effectively
controlled by the Commonwealth. When I suggest co-
operation, I mean that we should stand up to the
responsibility and the odium that Government inter-
ference in these matters necessarily entails. The Com-
monwealth Government have had to do the unpleasant
work. The Board have given their services to the
community, and we know that the rules and regulations
have caused considerable irritation. While there may
have been some inconvenience, it would have been
immeasurably greater without proper control of the dis-
tribution. South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria
are vitally interested, and I should like to see the
motion carried and presented to the Prime Minister.
We should share the responsibility with the Common-
wealth Government.
Mr. HARWELL.—The shortage of coal is due to a
shortage of shipping, and the question is whether we
should not urge the Commonwealth Government to
come to our assistance by diverting Commonwealth ships
to the coastal trade. It is necessary to overcome the
shortage of supply, and then to control the supply when
the coal is delivered to the various States. It will be
a very long time before we have a full supply. The
President spoke of rationing. I may tell him that that
has been carried out for a long time in South Australia.
The question of shipping should be considered in con-
nexion with this matter. Should we not urge the' Com-
monwealth Government to divert some of the Common-
wealth ships to this purpose ?
The PRESIDENT.—We can provide for that hy
adding to the motion that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment he asked to take such steps as are necessary to
increase supplies.
Mr. HARWELL.—Yes.
Mr. STOREY.—May I say that the senior State is
not interested in the matter of securing a plentiful sup-
ply of coal to anything like the extent of the other
States. I received at my head office a statement from
the Prime Minister in which he intimated that the
Federal Government intended to discontinue the control
of coal. I have received a report from my Mines De-
partment to the effect that —
In April, 1019, there was industrial unrest in connexion
with the coal industry, and on the 25th idem the State Go-
vernment appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the
industry.
On the sth May. 1919, the Commonwealth Government took
control of the distribution of coal.
It is understood that there is some agreement between the
Coal and Shale Employees’ Federation and the Federal Govern-
ment, which expires on the 31st December, 1920.
It is also understood that the coal-owners and the employees
meet in October next to consider the terms of a new agree-
ment.
Under these circumstances, we propose to ask the Com-
monwealth Government to retain the control of coal
until the end of the year. A big Commission is
inquiring into the coal industry in New South
Wales, and we are anxious that the Federal Govern-
ment shall not relinquish its control over coal until
the end of the year. By that time we shall possibly
have finalized our Royal Commission into the working
of coal generally, and shall be in a better position to
determine the situation. lam amazed that some more
effective action has not been taken earlier to induce
the Federal Government, which has been controlling a


large number of ships, to divert two or three of the
vessels from the particular channels in which they are
operating to supplying the coal by which our industries
are kept moving. We are called upon to develop our
country, to construct railways, and to carry on all the
functions associated with State Government, thereby
enriching the Commonwealth as a whole, and enabling
the Government, by a process of taxation and otherwise,
to carry on its section of Government, Because of that,
we ought to be able to appeal to the Federal Government
with some degree of definiteness and confidence to come
to our assistance to a greater extent than hitherto.
Until a little while ago a gentleman in the State of
New South Wales was able to get an option on six
wooden vessels built in America, and to some extern
obsolete because built of wood. The capacity of these
vessels is fairly extensive, and they might he run at a
profit. Why are they not commandeered for the pur-
pose of assisting the various States? I think the
States mostly interested in this matter are very modest
in their demands on the Federal Government, par-
ticularly as they are so entirely dependent upon coal.
Sir WALTER LEE.-—We are informed that they are
busy carrying produce for your State, and that is why
we cannot get them.
Mr. STOREY. —That is not a fact. My Minister
of Lands has been over here in Victoria because we are
trying to obtain shipping with which to take fodder
to New South Wales. At this moment I am in nego-
tiation with a gentleman who has control of three or
four vessels for the purpose of carrying produce from
States that can supply us.
Sir WALTER LEE.—-That is a very different story
from that we have been told.
Mr. STOREY. —Surely not told by any of my col-
leagues. If that were so I have been wasting time
in discussing the matter with them.
Sir WALTER LEE, —We have been trying to get
the shipping to bring coal, and we have been told that
the shipping must be conserved for the purpose of con-
veying fodder to New South Wales. .
Mr. STOREY. —That may be true, and presented
as the Federal Government usually present things.
They may have realized that it is necessary to come
to our assistance, and to divert one or two ships to
New South Wales for the purpose of giving the relief
we are in so much need of.
The PRESIDENT.—Produce can he taken to New
South Wales and coal can be brought back.
Mr. STOREY.—That is so. In the event of any
arrangement being possible between Victoria and New
South Wales, or the Federal Government and New
South Wales, there can be a back-loading of the coal
which is so necessary to yon. It is necessary that we
should take joint action, and that we should bring pres-
sure to bear on the Prime Minister. There is surely
some representative of the Country party here. That
is the only party I know of likely to influence the Prime
Minister. I am sure the President must know some of
them.
Sir WALTER LEE,—Are you speaking feelingly on
the powers of the Country party?
Mr. STOREY. —Indeed I am, I have a great regard
for the intelligence of the Country party. Just how
long I may think that way is, of course, another ques-
tion. We have the right to send in a strong joint pro-
test against what is being done. We in New South
Wales feel very keenly the handicap we and the people
generally are suffering because of what is being done
by the Federal Government in hampering the iron
industry by heaping on Customs duties to the degree
that they have done, Only last year we paid the
Federal Government in taxes through the Customs about
£40,000. The steel works in New South Wales is the
only place where steel is being made.
Mr. SCADDAN.—It is not the only one that wo
shall have though I hope.
Mr. STOREY.—In New South Wales at the pre-
sent moment the steel works at Newcastle are being
more than spoon-fed by the Federal Government through
the increase in Customs duties, to such an extent that
it is impossible to bring steel of a suitable measure-
ment into New South Wales. There is no one at the
present moment making steel in New South Wales, and
there is no one proposing to make it of the character
that is in demand. If it is proposed to do so it cannot
be done in less than three or four years.
Mr. SCADDAN. —What sort of steel is that?
Mr. STOREY.—-What is commonly called in the
trade “ordinary plate.” In consequence, it is useless
for New South Wales to use the steel works, as at
Walsh Island, the capital value of which approximates
£750,000, for the purpose of building a few vessels that
we would be glad to build, although we have had to
allow tenders for vessels to pass approximating in value
£500,000 just at the present moment. Our Minister of
Works is in negotiation with five firms requiring ves-
sels the total value of which will approximate £500,000.
We cannot build, because of the high Tariff which the
Federal Government proposes with regard to steel. No
one else is proposing to make the steel, and because
of that we think we are badly done by. Wherever it
is possible we should encourage local industries. Every-
one is in accord with that. But where it is not likely
that anyone will come into the field here we have no
right to give a monopoly to one particular industry
to the utter exclusion of others outside. Reference has
been made to our hydro-electric scheme. There are
sections of the mechanism required in connexion with
that scheme which cannot and will not be made in
this country in our time, and yet the Federal Govern-
ment propose a prohibitive Tariff upon them, That is
to the highest degree unsatisfactory. As a matter of
fact, the Tariff has been framed in such an unsatisfac-
tory fashion that one can only regard it as clumsy.
Mr. SCADDAN.—We are all pretty clumsy when we
are looking for money.
Mr. STOREY.-—ln my opinion, the Federal Govern-
ment has thrown the Tariff together in a very clumsy
fashion. It is clumsy in the highest degree to put a
tariff upon steel, that would come here in order to
develop industries, when neither the Federal Govern-
ment nor anyone else is coming into the field for the
purpose of manufacturing that commodity.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Quensland is coming into the field.
Mr. STOREY.—Queensland will never come into the
field to be a competitor.
Mr. FIHELLY. —We will not compete; we will win.
Mr. STOREY.—WeII, I will not argue with my
friend Mr. Fihelly, because he is so confident about
things which Queensland does. Being so friendly
disposed to him and his Government, I will not say
anything against them, but concede that they will do
what he savs they will do. Still, in New South Wales,
if anyone suggested that Western Australia or Queens-
land was likely for many years to come to be a com-
petitor in the making or development of steel—well, the
statement would not be accepted seriously. No skilled
person with a knowledge of the manufacture of steel
would imagine, in view of the high cost of its manu-
facture, that the supply of steel from Western Aus-
tralia, with its limited population, would be such in
the near future as to justify anyone coming into the
market to-day. It is quite on the cards that the
Broken Hill Proprietary Company, if they could bring
the machinery into the country, could make the steel
I am referring to, and within a few years manufac-
ture steel for the whole of Australia.


Mr. JONES.—WiII the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company make all the steel for Australia ?
Mr. STOREY.—They say so. It seems to me an
obvious fact that the Broken Hill people, with the capi-
tal which they have, will he able to manufacture suffi-
cient steel for the whole of the Commonwealth.
Mr. JONES. —They will have to increase their plant
considerably.
Mr. STOREY.—I said, in a few years’ time.
Mr, SCAT) I) AN. —Surely Australia will grow at the
same rate as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company’s
works.
Mr. STOREY.—I am backed up in my contention
by experts who were brought from England to New
South Wales in T 9 JO and 1917. They were two of the
highest authorities on steel making, and they reported
o.U the lines I have indicated. In 1914 Mr- Paul sub-
mitted a report to the New South Wales Labour Go-
vernment, in which he stated that the Broken Hill
Proprietary Company’s works would be able to turn
out sufficient steel for the whole of Australia.
Mr. BAR WE LL.—Your remarks are a bit wide of
the question of the shortage of coal.
Mr. STOREY.—The original discussion was on this
question, but the President allowed Mr. Barwell to
bring in the question Q f the position with regard to coal,
which is, not mentioned in the matter wo are discussing.
Mr. SCADDAN. —I was looking at the agenda paper
to see what you were discussing.
Mr. STOREY.—.Naturally, Mr. Scaddan is a cham-
pion of Western Australia.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I am a champion of Australia.
Mr. STOREY. —Well, if Mr. Scaddan is backing up
Queensland in this matter he is more gallant than I
gave him credit for. A little while ago a letter was
written to me with regard to cur hydro-electric pro-
position, in connexion with which we found the difficulty
in obtaining steel. In almost every scheme which we
have attempted in New South Wales we have had to
pay very high Customs duties. We are called upon to
develop our country by the construction of railways.
There are also water schemes, sewerage schemes, and
other improvements necessary for the proper govern,
inent of the country.
Mr. EHIELLY.—Wheat silos?
Mr, STOREY.—Yes, if you Uke. By such schemes
we increase the possibilities of our State from a develop-
mental standpoint. As a further consequence we make
it possible for the Federal Government by its, prooeesea
of taxation to raise considerably more money, because
of the enhancement in value that we have given to some-
thing to which thev have not contributed a penny,
and, naturally, as a further consequence of that, we say
that to impose a high Tariff on the very things which
make for the encouragement of the country, and
through which they raise more money, is improper.
Mr. SCADDAN. —I cannot quite distinguish between
“ you ” and “ they.” That is the trouble. It is only
a question of different directors, because, after all, the
same people have to pay.
Mr. STOREY. —That is obvious to everybody, hut
that does not answer my point in the slightest degree;
it only confirms my point.
Mr. SCADDAN. —You are only discussing a question
of policy as affecting Federal politics.
Mr. STOREY.—No.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I cannot see how the States, as
States, are really interested in the matter.
Mr. STOREY.—You cannot see how we are in-
terested! The cost of works, estimated at £1,500,000,
is increased by £500,000. We obtain the money by
loan. Instead" of getting £1,500,000, we have to raise
£2,000,000. We obtain the money from England, or
some other willing lender. With that money we decide
to carry out a certain work. Immediately afterwards
we find the steel necessary to carry out the work is
carrying 40 per cent, or 50 per cent. Customs duty,
which we have to pay the Federal Government, and
that curtails the amount we have for our purpose,
Mr. SCADDAN. —-That applies to every person
carrying on industry.
Mr. STOREY. —Of course it does.
Mr. SCADDAN. —-Then that is a matter of Federal
policy.
Mr. STOREY. —If the honorable gentleman is.
unable to see the difference between a Government and
a private person, it is not my fault. We in New
South Wales have, argued that it is in the highest
degree improper for the Federal Government to impose
upon us a heavy Customs duty.
Mr. JONES.—On steel.
Mr. STOREY—On things that cannot be made here.
Mr, JONES, —On steel that can be made here.
Mr. STOREY.—It is not made here. What may
be made here is a question of uncertainty. There are
things made here to-day that were not made in the past.
But when steel is' not being made here, and when the
works that practically have a monopoly are making no
attempt to embark on its manufacture, I say that the
duty is useless. In order to meet Mr. Scaddan’s
argument, let us look at the position of a private manu-
facturer instead of the position of a Government.
Supposing I am a manufacturer wishing to build half-
a-dozen vessels, or some machinery required for the
development of the country, and I cannot get the
necessary steel in this country, is it a fair thing that I
should he prevented from getting it from another
country by a prohibitive Tariff put on in favour of some
imaginary individual who may come along in the
future? In New South Wales, the ordinary manufac-
turer is being considerably hampered by the fact that
there are heavy prohibitive duties on articles that
cannot and will not be made in this country for half a
century. Are we to assume the attitude that we are
to sink into oblivion, from a manufacturing stand-
point, because of this imaginary individual who, is
coming along in half a century ?
Mr. SCADDAN.—I may agree entirely with all you
say, but this is not a question for the Premiers’ Con-
ference. It is a question of Federal policy
Mr, STOREY. —My answer to that is: that a con-
siderable amount qf correspondence has been going on
between the States; and I, as Premier of the senior
State, wrote to the Premiers of Western Australia and
the other States, asking whether we should put this
matter on the agenda-paper, and we have the affirmative
replies of those States.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Have a look at Item No. 2, put
on the paper by Queensland. It reads: “ Encourage-
ment of Australian Industries.”
Mr. STOREY.—There clearly is no objection to the
development and encouragement of industries. Mr.
Fihelly will see the difference between encouraging
industries that have come along to the Government and
said, “ If you put a certain duty on a certain article or
articles we will spend £1,000,000 in your country,” and


imposing duties on articles that are not manufactured
in this country. If there is a man prepared to utilize
the wonderful potentialities of this country to the full,
then I say that, if the Governments are unscientific
enough not to see the necessity of developing them
Mr. BARWELL. —I rise to a point of order. I ask
whether Mr. Storey’s remarks are relevant to the
question before the Chair.
Mr. STOREY. —I would suggest that the question
of coal be deleted, and that the business-paper be
adhered to.
The PRESIDENT. —I did not stop Mr. Storey,
although it seemed to me that most of his observations
are more pertinent to the subject-matter of the motion
to be moved by Sir Elliott Lewis on the question of the
payment of Customs duty on goods imported by State
Governments. The debate on that question was ad-
journed before dinner, and the matter will come up
again. Sir Elliott Lewis will then have an opportunity
of submitting a definite motion. Mr. Barwell asked
that the question of coal control should be discussed
because of its urgency.
Mr. EIHELLY.—The Commonwealth Government
have decided to relinquish control of coal. I think that
is a very good thing. I think the whole trouble facing
South Australia is not coal, but shipping. We produce
plenty of coal. Indeed, the Commonwealth Board has
worked very wickedly, so far as coal supplies are con-
cerned. The first Board set up by Mr. Hughes, which
was presided over by Mr. Justice Edmunds, gave in-
creases of wages to coal workers amounting to £369,000,
and gave the colliery owners increases amounting to
about £1,500,000, or, roughly, four times more than the
increase in wages amounted to. Following that, the
Commonwealth Government fixed coal prices for
Queensland. But Queensland, having the happy, or
unhappy, knack of looking after itself, appointed a
Board itself. We have some very good coal in
Queensland, but some of it is 1,000,000 years too young.
At all events, our Board, after examining all the
accounts, fixed the price at about Is. per ton less than
the Commonwealth price, and we declined to pay the
Commonwealth price. Later, after consultation with
certain proprietors, we fixed the price of 9d. per
ton less than that. I think that, if the South Aus-
tralian Government looked to the matter of shipping
and solved that problem, they would get their coal much
cheaper.
Mr. CANN. —Boiled down, this is a question of
shipping. If the Commonwealth Government will pro-
vide the ships, there is any amount of coal in New
South Wales. The reference to fodder by Sir Walter
Lee ought really to help the matter. If the Common-
wealth Government will provide ships to take fodder
to New South Wales, and then carry coal as back load-
ing to those places where it is needed, the trouble will
soon be overcome. In New South Wales there is prac-
tically a glut of coal, and in some places the mines are
not working more than half-time. If we could get the
shipping to transport it, there would be practically no
trouble. If, as I say, the ships could take fodder to
New South Wales, and load up with coal, we would
kill two birds with one stone. We should get busy, and
not only provide for the transport in this way, but
build ships in New South Wales. So far as control
is concerned, I think it would be well for the Common-
wealth to keep the Coal Board in existence until the
end of this year, at any rate. Reference was made to
the fact that coal cost £2 6s. a ton at Fremantle; but
it does not fetch more than 10s. 6d. a ton at the pit
head in New South Wales. However, as I have said,
the whole question is one of shipping.
Mr. B ARWELL.—I think this motion expresses
what I should like to put before the Conference. I
move—
That this Conference of Premiers urges upon the Prime
Minister the necessity for a continuance of the control of the
coal supply to the State, and for taking immediate steps to
overcome the coal shortage in such States as are at present
suffering from a shortage of coal, by placing some of the
Commonwealth ships on coastal trade in Australia.
There is no doubt that the shortage of shipping has
brought about a shortage in the supplies of coal, and
the shortage of coal makes control necessary. That
is the position so far as South Australia is concerned.
The PRESIDENT.—WouId you add that we are
prepared to co-operate ? My idea is that co-operation
should take the form of having direct State represen-
tatives in those States where a Board is necessary, so
that we shall share with the Commonwealth the respon-
sibility of control.
Mr. BARWELL.—I think all the States have repre-
sentatives.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I agree with the President. I
emphasize that in Queensland we are paying a lower
price for coal than that fixed by the Commonwealth
Board.
Mr. BARWELL.—That may be so in Queensland.
So far as .State representation on the Coal Board is
concerned, we have a railway officer on the Board in
South Australia.
Sir WALTER LEE. —But a Commonwealth officer
is the chairman of the Board.
Mr. BARWELL.—That is so. He is the Naval
Commandant of the State.
Mr. RITCHIE.—I should like to indorse what the
Premier of South Australia has said. The Conference,
apparently, is in agreement that something should be
done in the direction indicated. I may say, for the
benefit of members of the Conference, that on the 17th
instant we were told that if trade with Broken Hill were
resumed—and from information that I have I am
hopeful that it will be in the course of the next week
or two —we have in South Australia for the traffic
between Port Pirie and Broken Hill only eight or ten
days’ supply of coal. The stock at present in South
Australia is under 18,000 tons. That is, I think, the
lowest quantity that we have had since 1917. A couple
of weeks ago we took by rail 20,000 tons from New
South Wales to Adelaide. This cost us an additional
£40,000, largely because of the fact that, owing to the
congestion at Albury, we had to send the coal to Tocum-
wal, where delay occurred, in consequence of the break
of gauge. We took it thence by rail to South Aus-
tralia. It is a question of life or death to us
if something is not done very quickly. I feel
that New South Wales is quite as much inter-
ested as we are in solving this difficulty. They are
equally anxious to see the end of the trouble which
has been existing at Broken Hill for nearly twelve
months. I quite agree with the opinion which has
been expressed by several speakers that it is not so
much a question of distribution as of supply. If we
can only get the coal we shall be able to distribute it.
Mr. BARWELL. —While the shortage continues con-
trol is necessary.
Mr. RITCHIE.—The shortage is the result of want
of shipping facilities. It was suggested by one of the
Tasmanian representatives that this was a matter for
the States to move in. I may say, in reply to that
statement, that in season and out of season we have


been in communication with the Commonwealth Go-
vernment, but with -little effect. The motion that
has been framed by the Premier of South Australia
will meet the position, and I hope the Conference will
carry it, and that it will be sent as early as possible
to the Federal Government, so that some steps may
be taken to use the ships that belong to Australia in
looking after the interests -of Australia, instead of em-
ploying them in trade overseas.
Mr. JOMES.—I do not think the States can be
unanimous in regard to the early part, of the motion,
though we might all agree with the latter part of it.
That is to say, we can request the Commonwealth
Government to relieve South Australia and the other
States of the present difficulty in regard to the coal
shortage by granting greater shipping facilities. We
know how the Coal Board operated in Queensland. It
had a tendency to increase the price of coal to con-
sumers, large and small. The State Government is a
large consumer of coal. The Board had a tendency to
increase the price of coal when the increase was not
justifiable. There was an increase of 3s. a ton fixed
by Judge Edmunds, whereas a rise of 9d. would have
met the increased cost of material and increased wages.
Therefore, the re-establishment of the Board, as far,
at any rate, as Queensland is concerned, will be of no
benefit. It will not benefit Mew South Wales either.
I understood one of the representatives of Mew South
Wales to say that the increased price of coal fixed by
Judge Edmunds was beneficial to the coal miner. I
contend that the increase of 3s. a ton was not justified,
and that an increase of 9d. would have met the in-
creased cost involved in wages and material. I cannot
see how we can agree to the motion submitted by South
Australia. We can, of course, he unanimous in regard
to the matter of shipping.
Mr. SCADDAM.—Western Australia is in a posi-
tion different from that of the other States. We are
not wholly dependent on Mewcastle for coal. We
have a local supply, and while it meets the demand,
unfortunately we cannot store any. We have to de-
pend on keeping the railways going from day to day.
If there should be a stoppage of work through a break-
down we suffer. Our stocks have been depleted by
shipping strikes and other causes, and w© are anxious
to build up a store. I do not think we need worry
about the coal control. I am rather inclined to think
that the sooner we do away with it the better. The
coal miners and the proprietors in Western Australia
came together, and they said that they were going to
consult the Cooal Board with regard to price. They
visited Melbourne and reported that they had come to
an arrangement, that a price had been fixed, and that
they would carry on. They said it was an excellent
arrangement. It meant an increase of 2s. Gd. in the
price. That is a condition that arose under this con-
trol. It would he a different thing if the control meant
the insuring of supplies at a reasonable price. We
have to pay 465. a ton for Mewcastle coal delivered at
Fremantle, and we are told by a representative of Mew
South Wales that the coal costs only 10s. at the pit’s
mouth.
Mr. RITCHIE. —It costs us 425. by rail.
Mr. SCADDAM.—We are paying considerably more
than we ought to pay for Mewcastle coal. If the con-
trol meant that we wore to get coal at a reasonable
price, to enable us to carry on industry, I would have
no objection to it. Let us have control from the pit’s
mouth, so that all consumers will get the coal at a
reasonable price. How can we encourage our indus-
tries when we have to pay 465. for coal that is produced
at the pit’s mouth for 10s? What is the use of going
to the Federal Government and asking them to con-
tinue something that has not. been effective? The
States are paying more for coal than they should have
to pay, and this is under a system of control.
Mr. RITCHIE.—That is because there is a short-
age.
Mr. SCADDAM.—It took place before there was a
shortage. Men, by combination, get a price fixed that
is not fair to the primary.producers. Are we going to
ask for a continuance of that state of affairs? The
Commonwealth Government know all about the short-
age, and they ought to find a way out of the difficulty.
In Western Australia we control only one or two ships.
At the time we bought them we were considered to he a
rotten Government, but we are hanging on to them,
and it is a good thing for Australia. I think it will be
a good thing for Australia when we get out of the
shipping. That is by the way. I merely mention
that the Commonwealth Government own ships and
are operating them. It is not for us to tell the
Federal Government how to run the ships, hut it is
our duty to tell them the position arising from the
shortage of coal required for the development of our
industries, and to ask them to find a remedy for the
shortage. For instance, we have commodities in Aus-
tralia that we want to export overseas, and we cannot
get the ships. In Western Australia we have 25,000
cases of apples from one district alone left on our hands
to rot or to feed pigs with, because shipping cannot be
found. They ask us what our policy is. I reply, “ It
is not for us to tell them what they shall do.” What
we should tell them is that they must find a way to
supply the shipping required. The position is a
serious one. I do not think they can close the door
against a suggestion that this is a problem that ought
to be solved by them. They are the only persons who
can solve it. It is for them to find a way to do it.
I hope the time is not far distant when we shall be
able to utilize our own coal more effectively than is
being done at present, so as to make us independent
of Mewcastle coal. Failing that, Queensland may well
come along with its superior coal.
Mr. STOREY.—They tell me it is a gas-producing
coal.
Mr. SCADDAM.—We are short of gas-producing
coal in Western Australia. At all events, we should
point out our position to the Federal Government, and
leave them freedom to find a remedy.
Mr. BARWELL.—What means do you suggest?
Mr. SCADDAM. —It is not for any State to suggest
the remedy. It might point out a means which would
have the effect of inflicting a hardship on some of the
other States. The Federal Government have powers
that they can exercise. But I do say that a remedy
suggested by any one State might have the effect of
working a hardship on the other States.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I think that we need to very
carefully consider the motion that has been moved
by the Premier of South Australia. I do not think
it goes far enough, nor do I think it will be at
all acceptable to the Prime Minister. I have been
trying to work, out in my mind a reason for the very
sudden determination of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to relinquish the control of coal, and it appeared
to me that the answer to that question was provided
by tbe Premier of Mew South Wales (Mr. Storey) in
the letter that he read, in which he made reference to
the fact that, I think in December or somewhere to-
wards the end of the year, certain agreements were
running out between the mine-owners and employees.


One can readily understand that there may be con-
siderable difficulty in renewing the agreements. There
may be very considerable trouble, and, naturally, the
Commonwealth Government would ask itself why it
should be called upon to assume the full responsibility
of meeting possible troubles that may arise as the' out-
come of fresh negotiations. In any case, one has to
realize that it was not a very pleasant job that they
have had to carry out*. They have been called upon to
bear all the criticism. They have been inundated, I have
no doubt, with representations from the various States.
I have done my part. I have been shooting in tele-
gram after telegram, first from the 'Hobart Gas
Company, then from the Launceston Gas Company,
then from the shipping people, and then from our own
railways, who have been up against it, and it has
been no end of trouble.
Sir ELUOTT LEWIS- —Do not forget the small
manufacturers.
Sir WALTER LEE, The small manufacturers
have been crying out. We are now getting well into
the winter, and householders are being told definitely
that they have practically no hope of getting coal for
household purposes during the winter. That is a
serious position, and it does seem to me, notwith-
standing what Mr, Scaddan has said, that we must put
up some proposition. We have our share of respon-
sibility to shoulder in this matter, and if we can
devise, some means, whereby we may co-operate with
the. Commonwealth Government, it is up to us to do
ih The proposal put up by Mr. Barlow is practically
to askfor the continuation of the Coal Board. I do
not think the Prime Minister will agree to that, for
the reason X have stated. I do not think we should
ask him to do it. But wa should put up some scheme
of co-operation. X propose to move an amendment to
the motion submitted by Mr. Barlow. The amend-
ment has been somewhat crudely drafted, but it will,
perhaps, serve to show what I have in my mind in
regard to this question. It reads as follows; —-
That the Commonwealth Government be requested to defer
the de-eontrolling of coal until such time as the Board can
hq reconstructed, such reconstruction to take the form of a
Board composed of a representative appointed by the Common-
wealth Government, and one representative by each of the
State Governments concerned, the Board to elect a chair-
man or president, each State representative to be empowered
to requisition through the President such coal as may be re-
quired for such State, and to distribute same as may be
determined. This Conference further requests the Common-
wealth Government to assist those States who are at present
suffering through shortage of ooal by providing such
shipping from Commonwealth Line as can be provided.
That seems to me to be a practical offer at co-opera-
tion and a sharing of responsibility. After all, why
should we throw the whole weight of responsibility
upon the Commonwealth? It is only during the
shortage of coal that we are concerned with the pro-
blem. Should there he an abundance of shipping
provided at an early date, the trouble will be- cured
by that means. In the. meantime, I do not think
wo are going to meet the position by simply saying
that the Commonwealth Government should transpose
their fleet and put it to the carrying of coal. That
is not going to meet the position. Supposing you
could get your shipping to-morrow, there is a pos-
sibility that there would he an outbidding for the
coal to _ such an extent that Tasmania or Western
Australia, as the case might be, might find itself in the
position of having to compete for the coal in such a
way that, plus the freight on it, it would be practically
out of the market. We could not get it. Therefore, I
say we have to continue the Coal Board while the
shortage exists. If the Commonwealth Government
say, “We are no longer going to do it, because it is
not in the interests of the States,” who are we that we
.should say, “ You have got to do it”? I do not think
we should do that. But if we go to the Federal
Government and say, “ We appreciate what you have
done in the past under great difficulty, and' we are
now prepared to co-operate with you in the matter,”
then, I think, wq are going -to be met in a reasonable
spirit by the Prime Minister and the Federal Govern-
ment. Otherwise we are courting -a refusal, and we
shall find ourselves in a position of chaos. Under my
proposal we are simply asking that the de-controlling
shall be deferred until we can put up a scheme under
which we can mutually undertake the responsibility
of control of this commodity. I certainly would say
that some such motion as that I have dratted—at any
rate, the spirit of it —is that which would more nearly
meet the situation and be more likely to he given prac-
tical effect to.
The PRESIDENT.—We do not appear to have any
clear conception of what we might ask for in connexion
with this matter. In Victoria, as well is in South
Australia, and Tasmania, the position is serious. What
Sir Walter Lee has said about the shortage of ooal in
Tasmania applies with equal force to the situation
which obtains in Victoria at the present time. In a
telegram to Mr. Storey, and in a letter to me, the Com-
monwealth have advised us that they intend to re-
linquish control, but that they are prepared to co-
operate with us in any steps we may deem necessary
to meet the situation. I suggest that we should adjourn
this debate, and that representatives of soma of the
States most vitally interested should confer to-morrow
before the Conference meets. Then, perhaps, the Con-
ference might devote fifteen minutes to the question
before the Prime Minister comes, to see whether we
can harmonize our views and arrive at a request which
we can jointly prefer to Mr, Hughes.
Mr. BARWELL.—Don’t you want a resolution
agreed to by Conference?
The PRESIDENT.—My idea is that the represen-
tatives of the States most vitally interested might have
an opportunity of framing beforehand a resolution to
which we could all subscribe.
Mr. BARWELL.—And submit that resolution to the
Conference ?
The PRESIDENT.—Yes, in the fifteen minutes
which we will give to further debating the matter.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I must repeat that, as far as
Queensland is concerned, we have repudiated Common-
ivealth control in the matter.
The debate was then adjourned until the following
day.
CUSTOMS DUTY ON GOODS IMPORTED BY
STATE GOVERNMENTS.
The PRESIDENT.—Is it the wish of the Conference
ihat we should now' resume the adjourned debate on
the question of Customs duty on goods imported by
State Governments?
Mr. SCADDAN.—What are the subjects which we
are going to discuss with the Prime Minister ?
The PRESIDENT.—It is a question whether we
might not more profitably discuss those subjects after
we have heard Mr. Hughes explain his views.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Have those questions been sub-
mitted to him ?
The PRESIDENT.—They have been suggested by
him. Mr, Hughes asked us to meet him, and when


we inquired what subjects he wished to discuss he sub-
certain subjects, with the' accompanying ex-
planations. I think we should hear him in connexion
with those subjects. Then we might have a general
discussion with him with regard to them. Afterwards
we could consider the matters ourselves, and then see
him later,
n, r '. SOADDAN.—If the Prime Minister suggested
the subjects he should introduce them.
The PRESIDENT.—Nos. 16 to 25 were definitely
suggested by him. Therefore we might now proceed
with the adjourned debate on the question of Customs
duty on goods imported by State Governments.
Mir ELLIOTT LEWIS. —The motion which I de-ire
to submit is as follows: —
That, in the opinion of this Conference, ad valorem duties
should not be levied in respect of machinery and plant im-
ported by State Governments where such machinery and
plant— J
(n) is to _be used in the promotion of State enterprises
or in the supply of power, or
(h) cannot be obtained in the Commonwealth within a
reasonable time and at a reasonable cost, “reason-
able time ” being defined as the time required for
import from overseas, and “ reasonable cost ” as
the imported price, including freight, insurance
and duty.
That the foregoing resolution be made applicable to
machinery and plant ordered from abroad prior to the recent
introduction of increased duties.
The Conference will sea that this resolution proposes
to limit the consideration to the cost of machinery and
plant imported by State Governments, and that that
machinery and plant must be such as is to be used in
the promotion of State enterprises or, as in our case, in
the supply of power, and, further, cannot be obtained
in the Commonwealth within a reasonable time and at
a reasonable cost. That really meets what Mr. Storey
was referring to in regard to steel. It may be possible
to obtain the steel required in the Commonwealth in
ten years’ time, but these enterprises cannot wait until
then; and when the steel is to be produced it will be
then time to consider the imposition of increased duties.
Under the definition of “ reasonable cost” the importa-
tion would be put in the same position as if the goods
had been manufactured here.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I second the resolution.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I must oppose the resolution. 1
do not think that the State can interfere with the
fiscal policy of the Commonwealth. Such a policy, to
my mind, is one that encourages Australian manu-
factures and Australian production. Queensland is a
State which is engaged in many enterprises, ranging
from the timber industry to the fish industry, and it
also proposes to take on the manufacture of steel. But
all the States have their railways. As we are engaged
in these enterprises, 1 do not see that we could ask
the Commonwealth Government to vary its fiscal policy
so far as we are concerned. Just before the adjourn-
ment I was talking to a delegate who was generally in
agreement with my ideas on the proposal, and he asked,
1 ‘How would it be if we imparted £1, 000,000 worth
of material, and, alter getting it duty free, sold it to
some private concern?” In the old days I understand
that Governments had their goods brought in duty free,
but we must recognise that the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment must be the sole concern with the right to arrange
the Tariff and fix the duties. I must confess that the
two resolutions carried by the Railways Commissioners
seem to me to amount to an impertinence on their part
—a real impertinence. Our own Commissioner was
there; but I think that next time he will have his direc-
-9618.-4
lions with regard to such matters. The resolutions
read—
(l) That in the opinion of the Commissioners in Confer-
ence ad valorem duty should not be levied in respect
of materials not manufactured in Australia which
are required for the construction of rolling-stock;
and
(2) That duty should not be collected on materials re-
quired for the construction of rolling-stock which
were ordered from abroad prior to the levying of
the present duty, for the reason that sufficient quan-
tities of such materials of Australian manufacture
were unprocurable.
The business of the Commissioners should b© running
the railways, but, apparently, it is running the Cus-
toms and the Tariff. Th© Tariff should be a matter
entirely for the Commonwealth Government, and I
think it is presumption on our part to suggest for a
moment to them that any goods we import for the pur-
poses of State enterprises should be admitted duty free.
There may be industries which we cannot start immedi-
ately. Mr. Storey earlier referred to steel, but he
thinks that after a while Broken Hill will be able to
supply steel. I hope Broken Hill will be able to, and
that the Queensland Government will b© able to supply
more, and that we shall be able to export it. But unlees
we have solid duties on all imports wo can never hope
to be self-contained, and our Australia is quite a good
as the Yankees’ America, or the Germans’ Germany, or
any other country. Without labouring the question any
more, I must say that the carrying of the motion would,
in my opinion, be an affront to the Commonwealth Par-
liament. They have shown during the last three or
four days that they are well able to manage their own
domestic affairs.
Mr. STOREY.—You do not suggest that a Con-
ference representing all the States should allow every-
thing don© by the Commonwealth Government to go
unchallenged ?
Mr. FIHELLY.—I do not for one moment agree
that the people of Tasmania, the people of Queensland,
or the people of South Australia should have a bigger
say in these matters than the people of New South
Wales,. We are her© representing States separated by
imaginary lines; we are not representing Australia at
all. Thei Commonwealth Parliament, good or bad as
it may he, represents Australia, and the Commonwealth
Parliament must control all fiscal matters. Ido not agree
with them. I would have export duties upon wool; at
times, say, upon wheat, upon hides, and so forth. The
Commonwealth Parliament are elected by the people,
and they control these' matters. If the motion were given
effect to it would save Queensland £35,000 a year on
the importing of material, and it would be more honest
of th© Commonwealth Government to say, ‘‘lnstead of
giving you an exemption we will give you a subsidy,”
because it would amount to a subsidy. The people of
Australia must have control of these vital matters for
themselves, not through their State Parliaments—-not
through Tasmania, which has the same number of sena-
tors in the Commonwealth Parliament as New South
Wales with its big population, and that is quite illogical
and indofensiblei
Mr. STOREY.—OnIy in the interests of unity.
Mr. FIHELLY.—There should he no disunity, but
control should be through those elected to the Common-
wealth Parliament. We are of the same breed, we
lire the same people, we come from the same stock, and
om- ideals and ambitions are the same. The achieve-
ments of our men in the war indicate that we are the
one people, and if the idea of the imaginary lines that
divide the States is going to be perpetuated, I say it
means our downfall and damnation.
Mr. STOREY.—Do you suggest that because we
ask the Federal Government to modify something that
they are doing w© are attempting to take control ?


Mr. FlHELLY.—Unhesitatingly, I say two things;
First, it is an impertinence for us to make this request,
because the matter is entirely within the domain of the
Federal Parliament. Second, that function is one that
the Federal Parliament must exercise for themselves.
They have indicated during the past few days that they
are quite able to look after their own affairs; they gave
themselves an increase in Jsalary. This business is
entirely a matter for them. We have no more right
to ask for free importations for our own State enter-
prises than have municipal councils, which are also
doing work affecting the public directly.
Mr. STOREY.—Does not the fact that Mr. Hughes
has sent along a number of items that he wants to dis-
cuss presuppose that we are all part and parcel of the
great Australia of which you speak?
Mr. FIHELLY.—I do not regard Mr. Hughes as
Australia, but I do consider that the people elected to
administer Commonwealth affairs, and to carry out the
executive work of that Commonwealth, must retain full
control. Otherwise, they would be traitors to our
country and treacherous to our ideals. This proposal
is a most reactionary one. I make no reflection on the
gentlemen from Tasmania for having introduced it.
Tasmania has a very hard row to hoe, and we in Queens-
land have, too, but rather than help ourselves by agree-
ing to this proposal I would abide by the bigger prin-
ciple, and say that the Commonwealth Government
must retain control.
Mr. SCADDAN.—It seems to me that the whole
thing resolves itself into one or two questions. One is
a straight-out expression of opinion of this Conference
on the fiscal question, which, after all, was definitely
and distinctly handed over by the people of Australia
to the National Government, and the other is the ques-
tion as it affects the States from the point of view of
the Surplus Revenue Act. The matter came up on a
resolution from Western Australia in 1918, and I find
that on that occasion the Conference decided that the
matter should stand over until a decision had been
arrived at on the question of amending the Surplus
Revenue Act. The same position still exists, and I
think it would be better to defer the question until w©
know what is going to be our financial standing. I am
afraid that Mr. Storey ia regarding this matter from a
fiscal point of view so far as it affects Australia. To
some extent his views are in agreement with mine, and
if. the records of previous Conferences are looked at it
will be found that I expressed the opinion that it was
absurd for the State Governments to contribute through
the Customs to the revenue of the Commonwealth.
On the other hand, it is just as absurd to expect to get
revenue from the Commonwealth. The whole thing
is bound up with the distribution of the surplus re-
venue by the Commonwealth, and it would he in-
finitely better not to commit ourselves on this question
until the surplus revenue distribution has been disposed
of. I believe that matter will come up for considera-
tion at this Conference.
Mr. STOREY.—The question has been deferred on
previous occasions in anticipation that something was
going to happen, and in the meantime industries in the
States have been hampered in every direction because
of the extreme action of the Commonwealth in further
increasing the Tariff on material which is essential for
private industries as well as for those of the Govern-
ment.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Mr. Storey cannot get away from
the fiscal point of view.
Mr. STOREY.—You may regard it as a fiscal mat-
ter, hut I do not.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I expressed the opinion just be-
fore the Conference adjourned for dinner that we may
have changes of Government. For instance, the pre-
sent Government in New South Wales may be changed
some day or other—-one never knows; and ther© may
also be a change of Government in Queensland. In-
dustries have been established by one Government
which may evade paying Customs duty on certain
things, and another Government may hand over these
industries to private enterprise. These industries will
then come into competition with private industries
which have had to pay Customs duty, and the competi-
tion .would then be unfair. There are certain recog-
nised State enterprises which will always remain so.
Eor instance, State railways are never .run with the
intention of merely making money. They are pro-
vided for the development of the State, and nobody
would ever suggest that they should be handed over to
private enterprise. In regard to the railways, there-
fore, which are constructed to assist production, wo
may fairly claim that whatever is imported should not
he subject to duty. But for all other enterprisgs, such
as that referred to by Sir Elliot Lewis, the duty might
well he jmid because of the possibility of the Industries
being handed over to private enterprise. In Victoria
there may be a change of political views, and State
undertakings handed over to private enterprise.
Mr. STOREY.—I do not want to be always inter-
rupting, but the question which has been raised by my-
self and my friend is that where it is shown, in con-
nexion with the establishment of an industry, that there
is no possibility for many years to come of certain ma-
chinery being manufactured in Australia, that ma-
chinery should be imported without payment of duty.
That is our point. We ought to be relieved from any-
thing which will tend to prevent the establishment of
industry.
Mr. SCADDAN.—That is an argument which has
been used ever since there has been a fiscal issue, and
it has never been neglected by New South Wales, which
has always contained the strongest Free Trade element
in Australia. During recent years we have been in
a better position in regard to the establishment of new
industries owing to the disturbance in other parts of
the world, and we know that many manufacturers in
Great Britain have been establishing industries here
and doing the best they could to get protection against
the outside world. If wo take the view which has been
suggested by Mr. Storey I am afraid it will be accepted
as an expression of opinion on the fiscal issue. I think
we may indorse the decision arrived at in the 1918
Conference to the effect that consideration of this mat-
ter should be deferred until the larger question arising
out of the distribution of the surplus revenue is dealt
with.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—I would be the last man as
a representative of a State to interfere, or to appear to
interfere, in any way with any Federal function. I
have always believed that Federal functions are en-
tirely distinct from those of the State, and while I
deprecate any interference of State rights by the Fede-
ral Government, I equally deprecate any interference
by the States of any Federal function. Two of those
who have spoken on this subject have taken up what
appears to me to be a wrong view. Practically all the
States have undertaken large enterprises, and they are
properly extending their sphere of activity. In carry-
ing out these enterprises the States are compelled to
import certain machinery to enable them to carry on
their operations; and there is no greater affront offered
by those responsible for these State enterprises to the
proposal put forward by the Federal Government in
their own House than, there is by any manufacturer
or any body of persons engaged in an industrial under-
taking making representations to the Federal Govern-
ment to show how prejudicially the imposition of these


particular duties may be to their industries.
Nobody would object and nobody would think of inter-
ference with Federal functions if_the shipbuilders of
the Commonwealth joined in a protest against the im-
position of duties iu connexion with shipbuilding, or
if mine-owners entered a protest against an increase of
duties on mining machinery. Nor is it an interference
with Federal functions that the States should make re-
presentations to the Federal Government to show that
the enterprises in which the States are embarking will
he prejudiced by tbe imposition of these duties. That
is the position I take up.
Mr. ElHELLY.—Queensland is engaged in big
enterprises. It might be unfair to some States who
are against snob.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—I do not think so. If the
other States do not take up these enterprises there is
no reason why Queensland should have to pay heavy
and increasing duties before it can establish these
enterprises. My motion is confined to the importation
of machinery and plant to he used in the promotion of
State enterprises and in the supply of power.
Mr. SCADDAN.—And it does not matter where the
machinery is manufactured.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—This machinery cannot be
ma,nufactured in Australia. A duty .would have to be
paid on any imported machinery that can he manu-
factured in Australia. Ido not think that the matter
mentioned by Mr. Filially really comes into considera-
tion at present. This machinery and plant could not
be sold.
Mr. SCADDAN.—CouId it not be sold by another
Government ?
Mr. lIHELLY.—It is like the wire netting that the
Carruthers Government, in New South Wales, imported.
, Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—If it had been intended
by a State Government to undertake the manufacture
of barbed wire and it was impossible to get tbe neces-
sary machinery in Australia, why should that Govern-
ment have to pay duty on the imported machinery? I
do not think that any industry should he handicapped
by heavy duties.
_Mr. FIHELLY.—We sell an enormous quantity of
wire netting to the pastoralists.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS. —Not manufactured by
yourselves.
Mr. EIHELLY.—It can be manufactured iu Aus-
tralia.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—My proposal is limited to
State manufactures. Our desire is to encourage pro-
duction. The motion points out that the plant and
machinery cannot be produced in the Commonwealth
within a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. We
desire to encourage the means of production, and one
of tbe best ways of doing it is by allowing tbe free im-
portation of the necessary plant to enable that produc-
tion to be carried on in the cheapest possible way and
at tbe earliest possible moment. That is what we want
in Tasmania.
Mr. SCADDAN.—And you do not care where you
get the machinery?
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—We can got the plant in
America only. We have to pay a heavy Customs
duty, and the rate of exchange is very adverse.
We consider that the best mode of encouraging
production is to supply cheap power, and we
cannot supply the power so cheaply if w© have to
add on to it a duty of 30 per cent. If we have, for in-
stance, to pay £130,000 instead of £lOO,OOO it has to
be passed on to the producer, who will be the sufferer.
Mr. BARWELL.—I second the amendment moved
by Mr. Scaddan. I do not think we should consider
the question from the point of view as to whether it is
an interference with Commonwealth rights and powers.
I do not agree with Sir Elliott Lewis, but I agree with
the remark made by Mr. Eihelly as to how unfair it
might be to the taxpayers of certain States. We have
some States prepared to launch out on the nationaliza-
tion of industry. This proposal might act very un-
fairly to States that are not prepared for a general
system of nationalization. I hope we are all in favour
of encouraging production. This proposal is likely
to retard it. The effect of the motion will be to pre-
vent the establishment of industries for the supply of
these particular articles. I agree with Mr. Scaddan
that this matter is closely associated with the con-
sideration of the Surplus Revenue Act, and that we
should postpone further consideration of this matter
until we know what is to be done in regard to the per
capita grant.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I hope the amendment will
not be carried. I cannot follow some of the arguments
that have been advanced. There is no suggestion of
the infringement of Commonwealth rights. We are
simply asking the Commonwealth Government to assist
the State Governments, on whom they have made the
demand to extend production in the Commonwealth.
In furtherance of that desire the States are launching
out into various undertakings of greater or lesser
magnitude. In connexion with these undertakings they
find themselves in the position of not being able to ob-
tain certain machinery that they require in the Com-
monwealth of Australia. As has already been pointed
out by Mr. Storey, there is no probability within the
next decade of that particular class of machinery being
manufactured in the Commonwealth. Take it from any
point of view you like, whether from the point of view
of a Tariff discussion, or from the point of view of the
necessities of a State for the time being in the matter
of increased production, it seems to me to be utterly
illogical that you are going to put up a highly protec-
tive duty on an article that is not being manufactured
here, and is not likely to be manufactured here for
some considerable time. What is the purpose of it 1
Mr. LANG.—It would prevent other industries being
established.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Exactly ! That is the whole
thing in a nutshell. It seems to me that the position
taken up is a peculiarly illogical one. Coming to the
question of policy on the part of the Federal Govern-
ment, so far as the argument that has been put forward
that we are practically interfering with that policy is
concerned, the question is for the Commonwealth Go-
vernment to determine. We have no right to say what
they should do in connexion with the levying of a duty
on this or that article. That is a matter for them to
determine. It may be of interest to members of the
Conference to know that already the Commonwealth
Government have made a statement a s to their atti-
tude in connexion with this particular matter, but the
proposal which they have put up is in a very crude
form. The procedure is clumsy, but we have the very
embodiment of the principle which Sir Elliott Lewis
is asking this Conference to affirm. Mr. Massy Greene,
the Minister for Customs, in a statement which ap-
peared in the Argus on 25th March, 1919, under the
headings, “ Tariff Changes—Encouraging New Indus-
tries —Machinery and Sheep Dip ” —we are not asking
for sheep dip, I might say —stated: —
As part of its policy to encourage the establishment of new
industries in the Commonwealth and the development of those
now existing, the Federal Ministry is prepared to consider
application for a rebate of the duty paid on machinery im-
ported for the purposes of this expansion, and which cannot
be made in the Commonwealth.


In announcing the concession yesterday, the Minister for
Customs (Mr. Massy Greene) said that in the event of an
application being made for the remission of duty on machinery
on the grounds that it could not be made in Australia, it
wpulcj be necessary for the applicant to furnish full par-
ticulars of the machinery it was proposed to import and proof
of its landed cost. The applicant would also be called upon
to submit copies of all correspondence with at least four
of the principal machinery manufacturing firms in Australia,
showing that they were either unable to make the machinery
or could only undertake its manufacture at a prohibitive
cost, together with the applicant’s comparison of costs, and
any other information required by the Minister for Cus-
toms.
When the claim is established to the satisfaction of the
Minister, the Cabinet will be recommended to place on the
Estimates an amount equal to the proposed remission of duty,
which will become available when Parliament passes the Esti-
mates- “ The method proposed,” said Mr, Greene, ” while
fully safeguarding the interests of machinery manufacturers
and protecting the revenue, will be found more flexible and
better adapted to meet special oases than the procedure
provided under the existing Tariff.”
That is an enunciation of policy by the Minister of
Customs in regard to the very matter that we are dis-
cussing. The Commonwealth Government are anxious
to encourage the development of new industries in this
particular way. But our trouble is that the method
proposed is cumbersome, and is contingent upon the
will of Parliament. That is to say, you have to go
through tremendous work. Estimates have to be
obtained from firms, and submitted to Cabinet. Tim
matter then has to com© before Parliament, and to be
debated upon, and Parliament has to decide whether
it will do it or not.
Mr. SCADDAN.—You get the will of the people
through Parliament.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Not always, either in the
Commonwealth or Queensland. Sometimes you do in
Tasmania.
Mr. STOREY.—-With the hydro-electric scheme in
operation a thousand industries would spring into
existence.
Sir WALTER LEE, —That is the whole argument.
We have had a clear statement of the policy of the Com-
monwealth _ Government in the direction that we are
trying to indicate to-day. We say that the method
proposed up to the present is not satisfactory either to
themselves or to the States that are interested in the
importation of this class of machinery. Sir Elliott
Lewis has proposed, a clear-cut method by which it can
be done, and 1 think this Conference would be well-
advised—if we are as anxious as we profess to be, to
bring about the establishment of new industries and
the development of our latent resources — to try to
bring pressure to bear on the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, who profess a similar desire, to ensure that no
bar shall be placed on the development of any State
on these fines. We are asking for the establishment
of a principle that will stand investigation, and will
bear argument. It is so patent that I am at a loss
to understand the attitude of my friend Mr. Scaddan.
Mr. SCADDAN. You have only to convince your
)wn people.
. WALTER LEE. —Take the procedure laid out
in i\£r. J\lassv Crreene s statement. You have to got fit
least four manufacturing firms to say tiiat they are
unable to make the machinery. You are not going to
get them readily to make the admission. Call for
tenders to build a Dreadnought in Australia, and pro-
bably twenty firms will put in tenders, though they
will have no more hope of building a Dreadnought than
of flying to the moon, and the whole thing will be held
up because of the statement of some irresponsible
person that he will do the work if you give him time
enough to do it in.
Mr. lIHELLY. —Do you think we want Dread-
noughts ?
Sir WALTER LEE.—I do not say we do.
Mr. FIHELLY.—If we do want them, do you say
they cannot be built in Australia?
Sir WALTER LEE.—We have the possibility of a
statement being made by irresponsible individuals that
would block us from making this thing effective.
Mr. SCADDAN.—You are trying to convince the
wrong people. Aon have your Federal members.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am saying that, in addition
to our Federal members, we should lend the weight of
this Conference. We have a new Tariff before the
House at the present time, in which the trouble will be
intensified because of the increased amounts. There;
is one line in connexion with our hydro-electric under-
taking where the duty under the old Tariff would run
out at about £3BO, and 1 think I am right in saying
that the new duty runs into something like £2,000.
Mr. SCADDAN.—What on?
Sir WALTER LEE.—I think on material for steel
pipes.
Mr. STOREY.— Two years ago we had £45,000
remitted for the purpose of getting machinery that was
not procurable in Australia.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I hop© that we are not
going to confuse the issue. I have endeavoured
to point out that already the Commonwealth
Government have expressed their view in regard
to the principle w© are now discussing. They
are not unfavorable to it. In our opinion the
method which they adopt is not calculated to be effec-
tive. We ask the Conference to affirm the principle,
and it will be for the Commonwealth Government to
say whether they agree to it; but if we are united on
the matter, it will he a big help to the National Minis-
try in carrying it through the House of Representa-
tives and the Senate. I hope that the amendment will
not be pressed, and that we can come to a decision
with regard to the matter.
Mr. FIHELLY. — I would suggest to Sir Elliott
Lewis that the words “ ad valorem ” should be omitted
from his resolution. They might charge a fixed duty
on certain machinery instead of an ad valorem duty.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS. —They are ail ad valorem
duties; but I will adopt the suggestion.
The PRESIDENT.—I should like to see this matter
further discussed after the Prime Minister has met us;
and I would not he prepared to vote for an indefinite
postponement.
Mr. SCADDAN.—My desire is that the matter
should be deferred until after subject No. 20,
“Finance,” has been disposed of.
The PRESIDENT.—Then, perhaps, instead of put-
ting it in the form of an amendment, Mr. Scaddan
might move the adjournment of tho debate.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I move—
That the debate be adjourned until after item Ko. 20 has
been disposed of.
The motion for the adjournment of the debate was
agreed to.
■The Conference adjourned at five minutes past 10
o clock p.m v until 10 o’clock the following morning.

RAILWAY PASSES FOR BLIND AND
TOTALLY INCAPACITATED SOLDIERS.
The PRESIDENT.—The following letter has been
received from the Returned Sailors’ and Soldiers’ Im-
perial League of Australia:—
Melbourne, 20th May, 1920.
The Chairman, Premier’s Conference, State Parliament House,
Melbourne.
Ee Blinded and Totally Incapacitated Soldiers.
Dear Sir,
I am directed by my executive to ask you to kindly place
the following before the Conference of State Premiers now
sitting:—
At the late Federal Congress just completed in Western
Australia, it was strongly urged by the various delegates
of each State that the State Premiers be approached and
respectfully requested to grant free railway passes for
blinded and totally incapacitated soldiers. If the respec-
tive Premiers decide to grant this request, we, the league,
guarantee to prevent any abuse of the privilege granted,
and will make arrangements that each man blinded or
totally incapacitated shall produce a document issued by
the Repatriation Department showing that they are
totally and permanently incapacitated. The members of
the league consider, and know, that the Premiers will
agree with us, that we cannot do too much for these un-
fortunate men, who have given up so much and have
got so little to look forward to in their future life.
Trusting that we will receive a sympathetic and favorable
decision from the Conference now sitting, and hoping to hear
from you at an early date.
I remain,
Yours faithfully,
W. J. Henderson,
General Secretary.
The letter was referred to the Committee dealing
with matters relating to railway passes.
DEATH OE THE HON. A. H. PEAKE.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I desire to move —
That this Conference of State Premiers desires to express
its sincere sympathy with the State of South Australia in
the great loss it has sustained in the death of the late Pre-
mier, the Hon. A. H. Peake, who for so many years had taken
a foremost place in the political life of Australia, and whose
advice and assistance, rendered from time to time at former
Conferences of State Premiers, had been of much practical
value.
This Conference also desires to express to Mrs. Peake and
family its deep sympathy with them in the great loss they
have sustained.
Wo all deeply deplore the death of our late friend, the
Premier ot South Australia. There are not very many
present at this Conference who were associated with
him during the last two or three Conferences that have
been held, but those of us who have had that privilege
and pleasure will recollect how valuable were the ser-
vices rendered by him as a representative of South
Australia. He was a man of quiet demeanour, but of
strong convictions. We found in him a man who gave
considerable assistance in the debates that took place
at the meetings of Premiers on those questions affecting
both the State and the Commonwealth. It came
as a shock to me, and I have no doubt to others, that
he should have been so suddenly called away. His
death supplies further evidence of the fact that the
strain of political life does from time to time claia


its victims. It can be truly said that he was one of
those who in the performance of public duty sacrificed
bis own interests, and, to a large extent, his life; be-
cause I have no doubt whatever that the strain of
public life told very severely upon him during the last
few years. It was only a month or so prior to his
death that I had the pleasure, with you, Mr. President,
of meeting the late Mr, Peake in Victoria, and it was
quite evident to us that he was feeling the strain of
public life very much indeed. We all very sincerely
deplore bis untimely death, and we are only perform-
ing our duty in passing this motion conveying our
sympathy to the people of South Australia, and also
to Mrs. Peake and the family of the deceased, in the
great loss which they have sustained.
Mr. MITCHELL.—It was never my privilege to
meet Mr. Peake, but I have known of bis work for
many years, and one cannot help sharing in a feeling
that the Premiers of the States, as a body, have suf-
fered a loss through his death. I believe that no man
was more conscientious iu the discharge of his duties
than Mr. Peake. He was a very able and capable man,
and exercised bis talents for the benefit of tb 6 State.
He hoped to see the day when South Australia would
become a_ great and populous State, and I am sorry
that he did not live to see the attainment of his ambi-
tion, There is not the slightest doubt that, when a
man devotes a considerable amount of his time and his
powers to public life, his constitution is weakened.
There is a tremendous strain upon public men, not
only in regard to the problems they have to deal with,
but the criticism they have to meet. The late Mr.
Peake was known from one end of Australia to the
other. That was evidenced by the expressions of re-
gret from widely different localities which followed
the announcement of bis death. We can ill-afford to
lose such men as Mr. Peake. I believe be endeavoured
to do his duty to all sections of the community, and
I also believe that, as the Premier of South Australia,
he did splendid work for that State. I can only add,
with Sir Walter Lee, that I sincerely regret his un-
timely death.
Mr. BARWELL.—I should like to say, on behalf of
the Government and people of South Australia, how
much we appreciate the sympathetic references which
have been made by the Premier of Tasmania and the
Premier of Western Australia to the death of the late
Premier of South Australia. The tragic nature of his
end came as a tremendous shock to the whole of the
people of South Australia, and the universality of the
regret was evidenced by the numbers of letters and
telegrams received from many people in different parts
of the Commonwealth. As Sir Walter Lee has said,
Mr. Peake was a man of quiet demeanour, and pos-
sibly on that account be was somewhat misunderstood.
It was, perhaps, difficult to get to know him, but once
that difficulty was overcome, and you gained his con-
fidence and his intimacy, he proved a man brimful of
human kindness and sympathy. As the motion says,
he was a man who for many years occupied a foremost
place in the political life of Australia, and it would
not be too much to say that he was one of Australia’s
great men. His keen intellect, his sound judgment,
and his ripe experience were of great benefit to Aus-
tralia during the trying times of the war; and, if he
had been spared, they ,would have been of the utmost
advantage to the Commonwealth in the critical period
that undoubtedly lies ahead of it. He was known,
either personally or by reputation, to most of those pre-
sent at this gathering, and he had attended many Con-
ferences of Australian Premiers. Although I was not
a member of any Conference at which he was present,
I am satisfied that he made his influence felt at every
one of them. I can say, and I am sure everybody
will agree with me, that Australia is the poorer by the
passing of a man like Mr. Peake—a man to whom
the Commonwealth owes more than the people have yet
realized.
The PRESIDENT.—In putting the motion, I
should just like to say that all those w T ho have been at
the Premiers’ Conferences with Mr. Peake realize how
sane and sober was his judgment, how ripe was his
experience, and how valuable was his counsel and
advice. Although we had not the opportunity of the
close acquaintance with him that delegates from South
Australia had, we had learned to appreciate his judg-
ment and advice, and we regarded him as an honoured
colleague. Mr. Peake has left an indelible impress
upon the public life of South Australia—indeed, upon
the national life of Australia itself. The Common-
wealth is, indeed, poorer for his death, and to-day we
honour the services which he rendered to the State,
we revere and respect his memory, and we desire, by
the passage of this motion, to pay our tribute of respect,
and to convey to the people of South Australia, and
particularly the bereaved relatives, our sympathy and
sense of their great loss.
The motion was carried in silence, members of the
Conference standing in their places.
It was ordered that copies of the resolution be for-
warded to the Speaker of the House of Assembly,
South Australia, and to Mrs. Peake.
CUSTOMS DUTY OH GOODS IMPORTED BY
STATE GOVERNMENTS.
Consideration (adjourned from the previous day)
was resumed on the following motion submitted by
Sir Elliott Lewis:—
That, in the opinion of this Conference, duty should not be
levied in respect of machinery and plant imported by State
Governments where such machinery and plant—
(a) is to be used in the promotion of State enterprises
or in the supply of power,
(b) cannot be obtained in the Commonwealth within a
reasonable time and at a reasonable cost, “ reason-
able time ” being defined as the time required for
importing from overseas, and “ reasonable cost ” as
the imported price, including freight, insurance
and duty.
That the foregoing resolution be made applicable to
machinery and plant ordered from abroad/prior to the recent
introduction of increased duties.
The PRESIDENT.—May I endeavour to sum up
the result of yesterday’s discussion by saying that it
seems to me that it ought to be quite possible for us
to harmonize our differences by passing a resolution
in the terms I shall indicate. We do not want to
interfere witb the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth,
or to make suggestions to the Commonwealth Govern-
ment in a matter which is entirely their concern. It
is no part of the States’ function to deal with the
fiscal policy, but it is part of the States’ function to
encourage local industry and enterprise as
far as possible, and I think that in most
of the States there is a rule that preference
shall be given to goods of Australian manufac-
ture, and that the States are endeavouring to enforce
that principle. But it does happen that, on occasions,
it is impossible to get certain goods in Australia. It
is not a question of the cost or delay in delivery, but it
is impossible to get them at all, and that frequently
happens in connexion witb plant and machinery re-
quired for State utilities—for example, the electrifica-
tion scheme in connexion with the Melbourne suburban
railways. Considerable sums have been paid for duty
on such goods, and I think we might pass a resolution
asking the Commonwealth Government to consider the


question of devising a simple means of providing for the
remission of duty in connexion with goods required for
State utilities, where the same are not obtainable in
Australia. The Commonwealth could deal with each
case on its merits. Let it be done, not by legislation,
but by administration, so as to avoid all the long delay
that would be incidental to the scheme referred to bv
Sir Walter Lee last night, when he read extracts from
statements by Mr, Massy Greene. I think it ought
to be possible to arrive at some resolution, whereby we
would ask the Commonwealth to consider the question
of the remission of duty in respect of goods required for
State utilities, where those goods are not obtainable in
Australia. I am not prepared to go as far as Sir Elliott
Lewis goes in his motion. I agree with Mr. Fihelly
that we cannot interfere with the fiscal policy of the
Commonwealth, and I agree further that where a State
has, pursuant to the policy of the nationalization of in-
dustries, established industries that are competitive with
private concerns, there is no ground for giving a special
concession to the State. If it enters into the realm of
competitive enterprise the State should not claim any
concession for itself. But in connexion with essential
State utilities which are State controlled, and into
which the element of competition does not enter, there
certainly seems to be a very good ground for asking
for some concession. I have endeavoured to harmonize
the different opinions that have been expressed. Wo
do not wish to invade the principles which Mr. Fihelly
laid down as to the relative spheres of State and Federal
activity, but we want to get a concession for the State
Governments in matters which may be of very vital con-
cern to the development of the States.
Mr. STOREY.—We, in New South Wales, want to
get supplies for water schemes for quite half-a-dozen
large inland towns which, to-day, are waterless, and we
could provide the waterworks in five years if we could
get the supplies. They are difficult to obtain in any
case, but the difficulty is much greater because of the
heavy Customs duties which are imposed. In some
cases there is absolute exclusion of goods from America.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Is there not some reason for the
Commonwealth Parliament charging the duties? They
may be to pay for the war or to give protection.
STOREY.—It is only that the thing is done un-
scientifically. If we approach the Federal Parliament
and point out anomalies they may remove them.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You want to take their place.
Mr. STOREY.—Not at all.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am sorry Sir Elliott Lewis
was not here when the President re-opened this sub-
ject, but I think that the President’s idea was that the
motion, as submitted by Sir Elliott Lewis, might be re-
garded as an interference on the part of this Conference
with the fiscal policy of the Federal Government, and
that, therefore, it would be inadvisable to agree to it.
Further, the President said that he was of the opinion
that it was perhaps not advisable that a State such as
Queensland, where they are going in for a very exten-
sive nationalization policy, should have this concession
in eases where there is competition with private enter-
prise. It appears to me that there is hardly any State
utility that does not to some extent come into competi-
tion with private enterprise.
The PRESIDENT.—The railways.
Sir WALTER LEE.—It is a question of principle,
and one might argue that the railways come into com-
petition with sea carriage and road carriage. There is
competition in connexion with whatever utility you con-
sider. If it is the question of a State hydro-electric
scheme and the supply of power and light, the State, to
some extent, comes into competition with private enter-
prise. I think that if we were to adopt the President’s
suggestion it would leave the position very ambiguous,
and we should not get very definite results. I am in
agreement with him in saying that we should avoid as
far as possible the appearance of dictating to the
Federal Government on its fiscal policy, but I think if
we could evolve some -scheme, such as evidently the
Federal Government had in mind when they came to
the decision which was announced by Mr. Massy Greene
and indicated by me yesterday, it would he a good thing.
If we could come to an agreement as to some simple
method of giving effect to the principle that they them-
selves put forward, that would get over our difficulty.
If they would accept a reasonable assurance from the
State Governments that the latter had exhausted their
efforts to get material in the Commonwealth, and would
undertake to remit the duty on the particular class of
goods required, that would serve our purpose just as
well as the carrying out of the motion Sir Elliott has
moved. It means the adoption of the principle that
the Commonwealth has put forward, but in a less cum-
bersome way. If it were possible to submit this to the
Prime Minister,_ and put up a request to him to simplify
the procedure, it would meet our case. If that could
be done, it would meet the wishes of Tasmania, and
probably qf_ New South Wales also. I think it is a
logical position for us to take up for the encouragement
of production that the State instrumentalities should
be helped in every possible way through this means.
Mr. BAR WELL.—Do you suggest that it should
cover all State enterprise where it is in competition
with private enterprise?
Sir WALTER LEE.—I cannot see where you can
draw the line.
Mr. BARWELL.—You can draw it as regards public
utilities.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am agreeable to that.
Mr. FIHELLY.—The Commonwealth Government
is charged with certain functions and imposes Customs
and Excise duties. It may impose duties to protect
certain industries or to raise revenue for war purposes.
There is a reason for the imposition of the Customs
duties. If it is a parental Government it must know
whether it is right and proper to give certain exemp-
tions to local authorities. It would be better for us
to- endeavour to gain control of the Parliament that
imposes the duties. I should prefer that the individual
State Governments should make representations to the
Commonwealth Government. We are almost as
impertinent as the Railways Commissioners were. The
function of the Commonwealth Government is to
conduct Commonwealth affairs.
Mr. STOREY.—Surely you do not say that it is
impertinent to suggest that what a certain person is
doing is in conflict with the interests of the States.
If the _ Commonwealth Government acts harshly let
the individual States make representations. I do not
think the Conference should do it.
'Sir WALTER LEE.—We are all importers.
Mr. FIHELLY.—(Some States are different from
others. I do not think it affects us collectively.
Mr. STOREY.—If we appeal in our collective judg-
ment to the Commonwealth to remove an anomaly
surely that is not impertinent.
Mr. FIHELLY.—We would not object to any
remissions in the way of duty, and I would welcome
the adoption by them of the policy that was outlined


by Mr. Massy Greene. The Government did not adopt
it. If it had been adopted there would be no need for
this motion.
Mr. LANG.—The position seems to be that a number
of the representatives of this Conference desire to have
something done for the benefit of tbeir States. The
hydro-electric schemes that we intend to adopt in New
South Wales will prove beneficial to that State. We
wish to supply certain towns, to try to make the people
more prosperous and better able to pay State and
Commonwealth taxation, and we wish to give cheap
power for the establishment of industries. It is not
possible at present for the machinery to be manufac-
tured in Australia, nor even in Great Britain. Are we
going to have hydro-electric schemes in New South
Wales and Tasmania, or are we not? Or is the manu-
facturer to be burdened for no other reason than that
the Tariff might be increased for revenue purposes ?
Those responsible for the policy appear to me to be
cutting their own throats. It would be inadvisable to
start a manufactory for turning out this particular
class of article, which is not in much demand. To
my mind, it is absolute nonsense to talk about estab-
lishing such a manufactory. Wo hear a lot of talk
about production and assisting manufactures, but how
are the manufacturers to get on unless they can be
given cheap power ? They tell us that they want cheap
power in order to compete in the markets of the world,
and to afford employment to Australian workmen.
We want to see the works go on. We went them to
be established; but we also want the captains of in-
dustry to be given a fair chance to compete with
capitalists of other countries. That will not be done
if the initial cost of establishing these manufactories
is made prohibitive. Then, again, in our railway system
right throughout the Commonwealth there are articles
that are not being manufactured in Australia, and that
are not likely to be manufactured in Australia for a
number of years.
Mr. FIHELLY. —And you will buy cheap stuff else-
where.
Mr. LANG.—Not at all—and talk like that is
“ cheap tripe.”
Mr. FIHELLY. —I do not think we need be per-
sonal in this matter.
Mr. LANG.—I do not wish to be. The argument
generally might stand, but there is always the excep-
tion that proves the rule. The primary producer, the
man on the land, wants cheap transit. He does not
want to have to pay more in the way of imports on
articles that cannot be manufactured in Australia. It
may be said that within a few years, owing to the
imposition of the duties, industries will be started
here. But we know that, as regards certain things,
that will not be done, so that all the Commonwealth
is doing by its system of taxing is to make it impossible
for us to establish some' scheme of cheapening power
in_ order to encourage the establishment of local indus-
tries. A concession promised by Mr. Massy Greene
(Minister for Customs) was referred to yesterday bv
Sir Walter Lee. Mr. Massy Greene said he would
do what the Premiers’ Conference is asking, and he
would do it by means of a rebate' on the duty paid
on machinery imported for the purposes of the estab-
lishment of new industries, but the promise' was hedged
around with red tape. All w© are asking is that Mr.
Massy Greene’s proposal be put into operation, and
that it be made direct, instead of the State Govern-
ments having to face methods of circumlocution and
red tape. We want the position to be mad© quite
dear, and a direct method adopted, so that the States
will know what they are doing. We ask that Mr.
Massy Greene’s promise shall be kept. No doubt, mem-
bers of the Federal Parliament, and also the press,
were influenced to some extent in their attitude towards
the Tariff by that promise. Our friends are mistaken
they think that we are trying to interfere with
the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth Government.
We are doing no such thing, but simply asking that
the concession promised by Mr. Massy Greene shall be
made easy, and that circumlocution and red tape shall
be cut out.
Mr. BAR WELL.—While X adhere to all I said yes-
terday, I think it quite possible that a motion on this
matter could be framed which will meet with the ap-
proval of South Australia and of a majority of the
States. I am judging largely by what the Premier
of Western Australia said in reply to an interjection
I made just' now. We would be prepared to agree to
the motion if it were limited to public utilities; that
is to say, utilities that are State-owned and State-
controlled. We do not agree to the motion as framed.
It would have the effect of giving special concessions
to State-owned enterprises which are in active competi-
tion with private enterprises—that is, enterprises which
are usually privately-owned and privately-controlled.
If a motion were framed as I have indicated, limited
to public utilities —and the public utilities might pos-
sibly be set out; utilities that are, generally speaking.
State-owned and State-controlled, and excluding those
which are generally privately-owned and privately,
controlled —if that can be done, I shall be prepared to
agree to it.
The debate was adjourned.
ENGINE-DRIVERS’ AND BOILER
ATTENDANTS’ CERTIFICATES 1 .
Consideration was then given to the question of uni-
formity of examination for engine-drivers’ and boiler
attendants’ certificates.
Mr. CANN. —This, too, is a question practically in-
volving two points as far as we in New South Wales
are concerned —-uniformity and reciprocity. It is not
quite right to say that nothing whatever has been done
in New South Wales with regard to machinery inspec-
tion, because for many years we have had inspection of
our mining machinery and boilers, and there have been
no complaints whatever about it. In connexion with
this matter I may say that I am in rather an amusing
position, holding as I do the office of Secretary for
Mines and that of Minister for Labour and Industry. I
do not want to take any action against uniformity of
examination and reciprocity between the States, but at
the same time, as Minister of Mines, I do not wish to
discard anything that is effective. If the Conference
can meet me as Minister of Mines and adopt the same
uniformity with regard to inspection of mine engines
and boilers, I think we could be practically unanimous
on the matter. At present in New South Wales the
mining inspector who goes below inspects the boilers
and machinery at the same time. For years we have
had examinations for mining engine-drivers and boiler
attendants. The trouble has been that when a man
came, say, from Queensland, our Mines Department
usually did not accept the certificate. For the purpose
of securing uniformity of examination I, as represent-
ing New South Wales, am quite in accord with the
whole proposal, although I do not see why we should
discard what has been proved effective.
Mr. SCADDAN.—We are not suggesting that you
should discard anything.
Mr. CANN.—-It would really mean that. It would
take the matter out of the hands of the mining
inspector and transfer it somewhere else. It would
mean sending another set of inspectors on the job to do
what we are doing now.


The PEESIDEHT.—There has been a resolution
of a Premier’s Conference favouring in principle
reciprocity between the States and the recognition
of engine-drivers and boiler attendants’ certificates.
In the past there has been great hardship,
because a man would get in South Australia, say,
a certificate which was not recognised in Queens-
land, and vice versa. There is practical incon-
venience caused by the lack of reciprocity. After
the Premiers’ Conference had passed the resolution to
which I have referred, Mr. Theodore undertook to
draft a Bill. He did eo, and submitted it to the various
State Premiers, through the Premier of New South
Wales. It was not in all details acceptable to the State
Governments, and a conference of the men handling
the matter on the practical side was recently held.
They went through the draft Bill, and, after amending
it, have submitted it to the Conference. It is a Bill of
about 23 clauses, and it lays down the main principles.
Machinery is provided by which uniformity can be
secured in the regulations. As it is desirable that w©
should get uniformity, and make every effort to recon-
cile minor differences, what I suggest is that this
Premiers’ Conference should refer the draft Bill to
the sympathetic consideration of all the State Govern-
ments. The Officers' Conference could be kept stand-
ing, and could be called together, if required, to recon-
cile minor differences. The only stage which w© can
reach at this Conference would be to ask the State Go-
vernments to sympathetically consider the proposed
Bill, because it would be impossible to discuss the
whole of its details. I have had representations made
from engineers’ societies for alterations to be made in.
matters which we could not settle here —matters for the
examiners and the experts. I would suggest that Mr.
Cann might table a resolution, asking the State
Governments to sympathetically consider the Bill, and
facilitate the introduction of uniform legislation and
regulation.
Mr. BARWELL.—Have w© not- got further than
that? The draft Bill has been submitted to the various
State Governments. In South Australia, our Govern-
ment have considered it. That draft Bill was agreed
to by all the officers at the recent Conference. Al-
though it does not incorporate all our ideas, w© are so
satisfied that uniformity is necessary that we are pre-
pared to agree to the measure.
The PRESEDEHT.—I am not in a position to
pledge the Victorian Government to accept the Bill.
Mr. CANN, —I am quite prepared to fall in with
the President’s suggestion. Tire position of the Vic-
torian Government is just the position which the New
South Wales Government is in. We have not con-
sidered the Bill. As far as the Officers’ Conference is
concerned, the New South Wales Department for Mines
was not represented, and I think it should have- been.
I move—
That the Bill, as drafted, be submitted to the various State
Governments for consideration, with a view to the introduc-
tion of legislation providing for uniform standards of examina-
tion and reciprocity.
Mr. SCADDAN. —I second the motion. Personally,
I am not so keen about uniformity with regard to the
methods of inspection, and so on. What is done in one
State does not concern the other States, and I think
New South Wales should be able- to continue inspecting
mining machinery in the way she wishes to. What we
are desirous of bringing about is uniformity of
standard. A man may obtain a certificate in Hew
South Wales which will enable him to' be an engine-
driver there, but when he goes to another State be finds
that be is compelled to have a -sort of extra first-class
certificate to enable him to get work. Wte should also
have a definite basis with regard to the inspection of
machinery. There is a keen desire to provide that
machinery which has been passed as effective in one
State and then is sent to another State should be re-
garded as effective without the necessity of another
inspection. These, however, are only matters of detail
in comparison with what is underlying the general idea.
If we endeavour to get exactly the same wording in Acts
of Parliament in regard to the methods of examination
and inspection, we are going to fail. What I urge is
that the different Governments should meet the demand
which has been made for years, of recognising the certi-
ficates issued in the different States. Supposing an
engine-driver who has qualified in another State comes
to Western Australia to follow his calling, his qualifica-
tions may be all right, but we cannot be certain until
he has submitted to another examination, and that is
a source of continaal complaint. I am a certificated
engine-dxdver of both Victoria and Western Australia;
but if I were called to pass an examination now I would
fail, because I have not been giving much consideration
to that sort of engineering for many years. A man
might pass an examination in Hew South Wales and
get a certificate; but if, after he had been working
under it for fifteen years, he were called upon to pass
a theoretical test, he would fail. What we want is
that a certain standard should be set up, and that the
certificate which would be issued should be of equal
value all over Australia. We also want a similar
standard in regard to the inspection of machinery.
Mr. STOREY.—The proposal which has been sub-
mitted to this Conference ought to meet all require-
ments. In Hew South Wales there is a conflict be-
tween the marine engineers and the amalgamated
engineers, which includes men who are engaged on
work ashore and in the manufacture of engines. The
amalgamated engineers protest against marine engi-
neers being given preference over them in the manipu-
lation of machinery on shore. They assert that they
have become proficient because of their long association
with machinery used on land, and that there is no need
for the marine engineer to be given preference to them
in the driving or attending machinery in shore institu-
tions because of his supposed extra qualifications.
There is such a great conflict between these two
classes of engineers that just at present I do not know
what we can do to solve the difficulty. We may, how-
ever, try the suggestion put forward by Mr. Cann,
and provide that, as far as possible, a standard should
be laid down which will be recognised throughout Aus-
tralia. A man may be employed as an engine-driver in
Hew South Wales with an adequate certificate; but if,
for some reason or another, he has to go to Victoria, or
some other State in the Commonwealth, he finds that
the standard set up by the State in which he proposes
to reside makes it almost impossible for him to follow
his calling without undergoing a stiff theoretical exami-
nation, his failure is certain. We know that when
a man has spent fifteen years, or any other reasonable
time, in following a calling, after obtaining a qualify-
ing certificate, it would be almost impossible for him
to pass the examination again. , Take a University
student, and ask him, twelve months after he has
“ fagged” for a year to pass an examination, to undergo
another examination, and it will be found that he
would require a great deal more “ fagging” before he
was as efficient as when he passed the first examination.
The system in America is entirely different from that
which prevails here. In Hew South Wales, at any
rate, before a man can become a marine engineer, he
has to serve an apprenticeship in some workshop; and
no matter how many theoretical examinations he may
have to undergo, he must have previously qualified as a
mechanic. In America, a young fellow may go as a
cadet on a vessel, and as he becomes used to the machi-
nery he is able, after certain intervals, to sit for


examinations until lie finally becomes qualified as a
chief engineer. He, however, is only an engine-driver.
He has no idea of carrying out repairs, and, in fact, is
never called upon to effect them, because under the
American system an engine-fitter must be employed on
every vessel for the purpose of attending to any repairs
that are necessary. All we should decide is that an
attempt should be made to frame legislation which will
provide for a standard of general acceptance.
The motion was agreed to.
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER.
The Hon. the Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth, accompanied by the Minister of Defence,
entered the Chamber, and they took seats at the table.
The PRESIDENT.—I desire to welcome the Hon.
the Prime Minister to our _ Conference, and invite
him to introduce the subjects which he has suggested
for consideration between the State members and
himself.
Mr. HUGHES. —I am very pleased to have an oppor-
tunity of meeting the delegates to the Conference, to
discuss matters of very great importance that affect
the States qua States and Australia as a whole. When
I look down the list of subjects to be discussed, and
recognise on it old familiar faces that have been here
longer by far than I, and think of previous conferences,
and of the frailty of mankind, and the gap
that exists between intention and achievement,
I feel that my ardour is a little damped. But there
are some matters which I hope we shall be able to settle.
So far as I can put them in their order of importance
on the spur of the moment I will do so. The first
matter I want to discuss with the Conference is
immigration. I know of no subject of greater import-
ance, nor one that is of greater urgency than this. I
am not going to do anything more this morning than
just lay the programme before you. We have lost
60,000 men who have been killed at the war. It is fair
to say that there are another 40,000 to 60,000 men who
have been wholly or partially incapacitated. That is
to say, we have lost over 100,000 men in the prime of
life, and the effect of that on wealth production is so
obvious as to need no argument at all. In the second
place, as everybody knows perfectly well, we have a
continent which can accommodate from 50,000,000 to
200,000,000 people, according to its development, and
we have 5,000,000 people in it. There are other matters
that have relation to defence which I need not go into;
but since _ every reason, the promptings of prudence,
and the dictates of interest, suggest that we should get
more people, I want to have an opportunity to discuss
with you the manner in which this can best be done.
Of course, I am perfectly well aware that immigration
has been a question to which the States, and indeed the
Commonwealth, have directed their attention in the
days that have gone, a little spasmodically perhaps,
but still they have directed attention to it with con-
siderable vigor at times.- For reasons that I think
obvious, the result has not been as satisfactory as one
could wish. Now I leave that question for the moment,
and come to the question relating to the break of gauge.
I had a statement prepared by my colleague, who I
regret is unwell and cannot be here. It is a document
that might well stand for an epitome of the subject. It
is a long and painful journey towards perfection. This
break of gauge is a question on which every one is
agreed. As a broad, general principle, uniformity of
gauge is admitted to be a desirable thing. Having
agreed upon that, we find that discord takes possession
of the field and occupies it to the exclusion of every-
thing else. Nothing is done, but the time has come
when something must be done. I want to put a few
facts before you on this point, and I shall put them
very briefly. When the late Lord Kitchener was out
here, before the war, he said that the railways of this
country had been so devised as to be of immense assist-
ance to the invader, but of no assistance to the people
of this country. I think that is true. We really have
no Australian railway system at all. We have a rail-
way system that is devised, and not perhaps well, for
each State. We have really no Australian railway
system, and we have three different gauges. I think it
will be generally admitted that it is desirable, for every
reason, to have uniformity. It is desirable to have it
for development and for trade. The other day, in the
Commonwealth Parliament, the point was raised about
the condition of starving stock in New South Wales,
and I was adjured to put Commonwealth steamers on to
carry fodder _ from the other States to New South
Wales. I said that I would make inquiries into the
matter, and would in due course inform the House.
I did that. The inquiries I made showed that we had
eleven Commonwealth vessels doing the work already.
They showed that there were 1,100 trucks at Albury,
Wahgunyah, Tocumwal and Wodonga, and that 1,000
of them, fully loaded with fodder, were waiting- to be
unloaded. They showed that 178 trucks had' been
unloaded the previous day, which was practically a
record. If Australia, is to exist as a nation, the ability
to bear the tremendous burden of debt depends on its
stock. If it were necessary to spend £30,000,000 to
keep the sheep of Australia alive, we must get
the money. We cannot afford to let the sheep die.
When I am talking about starving stock, I am talking
about something that is a matter of life or death to
Australia. If our system is such that it will allow
the foundation of the wealth of Australia to be
destroyed, it must give way. It does not matter
what argument you bring forward, it bas to go or else
we have to go. I shall give the position as it was last
week—so it is not ancient history. It was at a time
when one of the members of the Commonwealth
Parliament, a wool grower, was discussing methods to
keep his sheep alive. The question was the price of
fodder and the difficulty of getting it. It is useless to
feed your sheep this week if you cannot get fodder for
them next week. This information that I have is
dated_ 20th May inst. At 8 o’clock on the previous
morning this was the condition of affairs—

Trucks released yesterday .. .. .. 21
From the above it will be seen that there are at present 1,194
Victorian trucks, of which it is safe to say over 1,000 contain
fodder waiting to unload at New South Wales border towns.
Yesterday 178 trucks were unloaded, and this was greatly
above the average for many days.
Now that is one point. If there were no other reason
why we should have uniformity of gauge, that in itself
is a sufficient reason. But there are hundreds of others.


Let us look to the history of railway development
in other countries. We are not the only sinners.
Every country has done exactly as we have done.
Bright geniuses have come along with their different
ideas. Some have said that the gauge should be 4 ft.
in.; some have said it should be 4 ft. 6 in.; some
have said it should be 5 ft. 3 in.; others that it should
be 6 feet. That country in which genius is most prolific
probably had the greatest number of railway gauges.
It might be regarded as a great compliment to us that
we have three. However, this was the position in Great
Britain: A Royal Commission inquired into this trouble
of the gauges as far back as the year 1846, and in
1870 the work was entered upon-. That is to say, a
mere 20 or 30 years elapsed after the appointment of
the Royal Commission before the whole of the gauge?
were converted to 4 ft. 8J in. Similarly, in the United
States they built their railways without regard to the
future, and in 1886 there were in the United States
at least seven different gauges. IV© have always known
that America is a wonderful country, and that genius
there is
Thick as autumnal leaves that strew the brooks
In Vallomhrosa
wherever that is. However, in 1886 a uniform gauge
of 4 ft. 8| in. was adopted in the United States, and
at least 13,000 miles of main line were converted.
Prom that time the United States have had a national
system of railways, allowing of free and unrestricted
communication throughout the length and breadth of
the country, irrespective of difference in ownership or
of State boundaries. Mr. E. A. Pratt, an authority
on railways, says—
This uniformity of railway gauge has, in fact, been a
most important factor in rendering the United States still
more united than they would otherwise have been. It knit
west, north, and south still more closely to the east, and
made the different States feel that they really constituted
part and parcel of one and the same nation.
I need nob remind you of what is being done still. I
see the name of Sir Henry Parkes, whom I just re-
member, and I have here a quotation from a letter
dated 18th May, 1889, addressed to him by the late
Mr. E. M. G. Eddy, then Chief Commissioner for
Railways. Among Mr. Eddy’s suggestions was the
following;
That the various Colonies should affirm —
5. That the Chief Commissioner or Chairman of the
Railway Board in each Colony, with one colleague (to be
selected by the Chief Commissioner or Chairman) be a
Commission to consider—
(l) what shall be the gauge of the future;
(2) in what proportions the cost of the change shall
be borne by the respective Colonies;
(3) the probable cost of carrying out the change;
(4) the number of years the cost of the change shall
he spread over, and the amount of money set
aside each year as a sinking fund;
(5) the date on which the change of gauge shall take
place.
Northing was don© for eight years. Apparently the
question remained dormant until the meeting of the
Federal Convention, in Adelaide, in April of 1897,
when, as the result of representations made, the Pre-
miers of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and
South Australia remitted the matter for the considera-
tion of the respective Railways Commissioners of the
three States named. In August, 1897, the Railways
Commissioners, in conference, in Melbourne, resolved—
The Commissioners, in view of the contemplated Federation
of the Australian Colonies, and the desirability of providing
the utmost facility for inter-communication, are impressed
with the necessity of having as soon as possible a uniform
gauge.
In May, 1899, the Railways Commissioners of Aus-
tralia, in conference, in Brisbane, resolved—
In future any work to be carried out on the 5-ft. 3-in.
gauge should be desigued so as to be easily adapted to the
4-ft. Spin, gauge.
In February, 1911, the War Railway Council in Mel-
bourne resolved —
In the interests of defence, this War Railway Council
affirms the desirability as regards the main lines of com-
munication, of a uniform gauge for the railways of Australia.
In January, 1912, the Premiers’ Conference in Mel-
bourne resolved—
That a Committee of the leading railway engineers of the
Commonwealth and States be appointed to investigate the
question of the selection of a uniform gauge between the
capital cities of Australia.
This was about twenty-three years after Mr. Eddy had
suggested a uniform gauge. The Premiers’ Confer-
ence said they would remit the matter to a committee
to investigate. In fact, - I have done something like
that myself quite often. However, this Committee
met, and recommended the adoption of a standard 4-ft.
8-J-in. gauge for Australia, for the following reasons; —
(а) There would be a saving of expense at every break
of gauge;
(б) the comfort and convenience of passengers would he
enhanced;
(o) it would be imperative in connexion with military
movements should they at any time become neces-
sary ;
(d) it would lend encouragement to traffic, as it would
facilitate the transfer of goods and passengers;
and
(e) it would tend to reduce the total quantity of
rolling-stock required for railway purposes in
Australia.
Aud then, in March, 1914, the Premiers’ Conference
in Melbourne agreed to refer this matter to the Inter-
State Commission, and Mr. Piddington has informed
me that, just ,at the very moment when the Inter-State
Commission was about to begin to consider it, its atten-
tion was unhappily switched on to the consideration
of the Tariff, and the matter was not proceeded with
any further. In November, 1914, at the Premiers’
Conference in Melbourne, Mr. Fisher, my late leader
and predecessor in office, said that the Commonwealth
Government was strongly in favour of a uniform rail-
way gauge throughout Australia, and was prepared to
go a long way in the matter of the raising of money.
In May, 1915, the Premiers’ Conference in Sydney
resolved—
That in the opinion of this Conference a Commission of
two leading railway experts, preferably from outside Aus-
tralia, should be forthwith appointed by the Governments of
the Commonwealth and the mainland States to consider,
report, and advise upon the question of unifying the gauge
of Australian railways.
Of course, it would take a long time to get leading
railway experts from outside Australia to our shores,
and this would afford a reasonable chance that they
would not arrive at any decision in our time. Then,
in October, 1915, the War Railway Council in Sydney
resolved—
That the most important railway improvement, from a mili-
tary stand-point, would be the unification of the gauges.
The paper from which I have quoted will be circu-
lated. ■ I desire only to say this: I am not going to
take the responsibility for further delay, nor the con-
sequences of a failure on the part of the land transport
of Australia through neglect to deal with a matter
which is absolutely vital to Australia’s interests. On
this question, as I began I shall end, by saying that,
if there were no other reason at all than the reason of
dealing with our periodical drought conditions, that
would be in itself an ample reason for effecting the
change. We shall lose as much in this drought as
would have very nearly, if not quite, sufficed to effect
the change of gauge.


Mr. STOREY.—-Whom do you suggest is the cul-
prit ?
Mr. HUGHES.—I say we are all culprits. I am a
repentant man; and I am a sinner of this kind; When
I repent I am going to make it so uncomfortable for
those who do not repent, that I shall have the penitent-
form filled right up.
Mr. LOTTGHLIH. —What about putting the re-
mainder of the ships on to the transport of fodder?
Mr. HUGHES.—One of the reasons is that some of
our ships are 10,000 miles away, some 9,000 miles away,
and some only 8,000 miles away, while there are others
only 4,000 miles away; but these trucks at Wah-
gunyah, Tocumwal, and Albury are there.
Mr. RITCHIE.—Can the Prime Minister give any
figures showing the quantity of fodder which has left
South Australia for Hew South Wales by Common-
wealth ships?
Mr. HUGHES. —I could not tell you. You might
just as well ask me who pitched the bottom of the Ark.
Mr. RITCHIE.—You quoted the figures that suited
you.
Mr. HUGHES.—We have now nine of our vessels
permanently on the coast.
Mr. FIHELLY.—CouId you give the names of those
ships ?
Mr. HUGHES.—I gave them in the House of
Representatives. I also said that this shipping line,
which is owned and controlled by the Commonwealth,
that is, by the taxpayers and citizens of this country,
is the only shipping line in the world flying the British
flag outside the great British combine, and I said that
those gentlemen who were continually urging that every
Commonwealth vessel should be put on the coastal
trade could not better serve the purposes of Lord
Inchcape if they had been briefed. How I will get on
to the question of aviation. This is a matter on which
we can agree without very much trouble. You know
the position—that the laws, which did not contemplate
traffic in the air, make no provision for it. If we are
going to have commercial aviation, and if we are going
to have aviation—indeed, we must have mili-
tary aviation, and, possibly, aviation for postal pur-
poses —then there must be laws governing the air traffic,
and it is necessary that those laws shall be uniform.
We cannot have one law- for one place and a different
one for another. There must be uniform laws. I may
remind you that in Paris there was held an Inter-
national Air Conference, which decided upon uniform
air traffic regulations the world over, and provided that
the planes should not be licensed unless inspected in
a certain way at certain intervals. You understand it
is very dangerous to allow men to go up as at present.
There is nothing to prevent a man going up on any
machine, _ and, of course, there is nothing to prevent
him coming down. What is wanted is tie most rigid
inspection. If inspection is necessary with regard to
ships, it is at least as necessary with regard to aero-
planes. The Commonwealth Constitution is silent with
regard to aviation, and although I have contended, and.
do contend, that we have this power to make uniform
laws, still it would be most inadvisable to bring in legis-
lation about which there is a doubt. So we want, in
short, the authority of the States to bring in legisla-
tion in the Commonwealth Parliament relating to the
conduct and regulation of traffic in the air, provid-
ing for the inspection of machines, and making all those
necessary provisions that are set out in the air regula-
tions which were agreed to in Paris, to which this
country, by the way, is a party. How I come to indus-
trial legislation. This is a very wide question, but
there are one or two aspects that may be touched upon.
At the present time there are fifty-one cases waiting
here at the Federal Arbitration Court. It is very de-
sirable that unions should seek redress in Courts rather
than resort to strikes. It is no use telling men to seek
redress in Court if there is undue delay. The delay
arises from many causes. One of those causes is that
the work is too much for one Court to deal with. Our
Constitution prevents us appointing acting Judges; wo
cannot do that.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You can appoint Judges.
Mr. HUGHES.—We can appoint Judges for life.
Mr. FIHELLY.—What is wrong with that?
Mr. HUGHES. —Well, nothing, excepting, of cour& e,
that we have to deal with a temporary condition—a
temporary congestion. If you wanted a man to black
your boots, would you give him a life job?
Mr. STOREY. —Do you suggest that the industrial
conditions are of a temporary character?,
Mr. HUGHES.—This particular phase is tem-
porary; that js to say, it is a congestion which it re-
quires a certain number of Judges to get over.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Is not the difficulty temporarily
permanent ?
Mir. HUGHES. —If the honorable gentleman re-
gards this matter as humorous, I have nothing further
to say. I think it is serious.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I am afraid you are providing a
wrong atmosphere this morning.
Mr. HUGHES. —We cannot appoint temporary
Judges, and we cannot contemplate appointing per-
manent Judges whose functions will be confined to the
Arbitration Court unless the Commonwealth power in
relation to industrial matters is made very much wider
than it is now. Everybody knows that the powers of
the Commonwealth in regard to industrial matters are
very limited indeed. What I was going to suggest is
that we might come to some agreement for the estab-
lishment of an Industrial Court composed of Federal
and State Judges, which would, perhaps, create a real
Australian Court, to deal with industrial matters. I
want you to think; over that suggestion. It is true
that we cannot act without the co-operation of all. If
we had a Court composed of one Federal Judge, with
a roster of State Judges, from which two or more
could be selected, as convenient to the location of
the case to be tried, we should get over a great deal
of the trouble, and, what is more to the point, we
should be able to sweep away those anomalies that arise
from various awards as between States and States, and
as between the States and the Commonwealth. With
a Court constituted _ as I suggest, the State Judges
would be quite familiar with the State conditions, and
at the same time they would have Federal jurisdiction,
and their decisions would apply throughout the whole
of the Commonwealth. The other point is, of course,
much more important. It arises out of. the failure of
the people to grant the increased powers asked for at
the referendum. You will remember that just before
the last Commonwealth election a Conference was con-
vened with the idea of arriving at a decision in regard
to the granting of additional powers to the Common-
wealth.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You did not want those powers
for very long.
Mr. HUGHES.—How is that?
Mr. FIHELLY.—You asked for them for a certain
period only, and not for all time,


Mr. HUGHES. —-I asked for them for a certain
period because the gentlemen who were present said
that they would not give them to me permanently. If
I wanted £5, I would ask you to lend it to me for a
fortnight, then, at the end of the fortnight, you might
be away, and the thing could be adjusted in that way.
Everybody knows that I did not want those powers for
a year or two; I wanted them for all time.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I am in favour of giving them
to you for all time.
Mr. HUGHES.—Then there will be no quarrel be-
tween us on that point. What I am asking for now
is something quite different; but, if this Conference
is prepared to give me the powers asked for at the
referendum, so much the better.
Mr. FIHELLY.—The powers you asked for were
very limited.
Mr. HUGHES.—I did the best I could. The Con-
ference would not give me any more.
Mr. SCAHDAH.—You did not accept the decision
of the Conference.
Mr. HUGHES.—I may say that the representative
of Queensland at that Conference was no more liberal
than any other representative.
Mr. FIHELLY.—T will look up the Conference re-
cord.
Mr. HUGHES.—That will not affect the matter.
You will find that I was always asking for more, and
that the others always suggested I should take less.
I am very glad to hear the representative from Queens-
land say now that he is prepared to give me all I
want. The only objection seems to be my moderation.
I am not generally regarded as moderate in my de-
mands, and if that is my crime I can very soon correct
it. If we are to deal effectively with the present indus-
trial unrest, we ought to have more power. I have
suggested one of the ways of creating a real Austra-
lian Court. I have refrained from calling it a Com-
monwealth Court, because I want it to be a purely
Australian institution, in which State Judges will have
jurisdiction, and which will deal with such disputes as
we consider proper to remit to it.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Will it be in substitution for
the State Courts?
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho; it will be in substitution for
the Federal Court.
Sir WALTER LEE.—That will still leave one of
the worst difficulties.
Mr. HUGHES.—I do not want to wipe out the
State Courts; they are doing good work. The Federal
Court has, first of all, to deal with a great congestion
of cases, and it is limited all the time by the Consti-
tution. I want to give it wider powers, and to limit
its application to the class of cases which ought to
come before it. The scheme is not without its diffi-
culties I admit, but it is worth considering. There is
another point. I have appointed a Basic Wage Com-
mission, which is conducting inquiries in the various
capitals.
Mr. FIHELLY.—When do you expect it will finish
its job?
Mr. HUGHES.—I could not say. I make no
claims to be regarded as a prophet. But I did ask
one of the members of the Commission when he thought
they would finish, and whether it would be this or the
next century, and he said it would be all right. How-
ever, that is nothing. Eventually they will finish their
inquiries, and when they finish they will make their
recommendations. I need hardly tell you that the
question of the basic wage is of vital importance to
Australia. It will touch every man and every woman
who works in this country, and it will touch every man
who employs other workers.
Mr. STOREY.—WiII it touch the fellow who l does
not work ?
Mr. HUGHES.—How can you have a basic wage for
a man who does nob work ? I shall not object to your
destroying such people by putting them in a lethal
chamber if you like. I work, God knows ! 1 am try-
ing to point out to you that this matter is easily the
most important that can engage the attention of this
Conference, because it is going to affect the standard of
living; it is going to affect the outlook of men, and it
is going to affect this country in a hundred ways. All
I want to say is that, when the Commission make their
recommendations, we have no power to deal with them.
Mr. STOREY.—Do you say there is no power to
give effect to them ?
Mr. HUGHES.—The Commonwealth has not the
power; the States have. When I went to the country
I told the people of the appointment of the Commis-
sion, and said I wanted the powers under the referen-
dum to give effect to its recommendations. The people
did not grant those powers, and now I come to you,
in whom those powers rest, and ask you for your co-
operation. We must consider what we are going to do .
Mr. FIHELLY.—Do you want the States to sur-
render powers to the Commonwealth to enable the
Commonwealth to deal with the findings of the Basic
Wage Commission?
Mr. HUGHES. —I am satisfied that they should give
us the power to enable us to give effect to the Com-
mission’s findings if the Commonwealth Government is
able to accept them, or, alternatively, that each of the
States should give effect to them.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Have a Federal Convention to
alter the Constitution.
Mr. HUGHES.—It would be some time before we
could have a Federal Convention. First, there woiild
have to be an election of delegates. The Convention
would have to consider the matter, and then it would
have to goi to - the people. Before there can be an
alteration of the Constitution the people must assent
to it, and that means a year from now before the
matter could be dealt with.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You admit that the Commission
will nob have their findings ready by that time.
Mr. HUGHES.—They will have their findings ready
quite soon, and I am pointing out that we cannot give
effect to them without the co-operation of the States.
With the co-operation of the States we can give effect
to 'them. I ask members of the Conference to consider
whether they are prepared to co-operate.
Mr. STOREY.—On what lines shall we be asked to
co-operate ?
Mr. HUGHES. —1 am prepared to accept any pro-
posal. If the Commission said that the basic wage
should be £lO a week I could not adopt that, because
the country does not produce that much per head; but
I want to ask you whether you will co-operate in giving
effect to whatever we say is a fair thing upon the re-
commendations of the Commission, and, if so, I ask
you which way you prefer. lam not putting any par-
ticular way before you. You can discuss the ways.
I am prepared to fall in with you.
Mr. STOREY.—You are asking us to co-operate in
something that we do not know anything about, other
than what wo have gathered in a general way. You


say there is a Commission in existence doing certain
work, and when it is finalized you want our co-opera-
tion.
Mr. HUGHES.-—-To give effect to the basic wage.
If the Commission said that the basic wage should he
£4 a week, the Commonwealth would have no power
to give effect to that except in respect to its own em-
ployees. I say to you, Mr. Storey, are you prepared
to give effect to it in the State of New South Wales?
I now come to a relatively small matter —one affecting
more than 100,000 men. I refer to the cashing of
war gratuity bonds. You all know how the position
stands. The Commonwealth is cashing all its em-
ployee’s bonds, the State of New South Wales agreed
to do so, and, I think, the State of Victoria.
The PRESIDENT.—No.
Mr. HUGHES.—My brief reads—“ The States of
New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland have al-
ready agreed to cash the bonds of the employees of
their States.”
The PRESIDENT.—No. That is a mistake. What
the State of Victoria agreed to do was to accept war
gratuity bonds in payment of obligations under the
soldier settlement scheme, provided the Commonwealth
Government would accept those bonds in redemption
of our liability to the Commonwealth under the same
scheme.
Mr. FIHELLY (to Mr. Hughes).—l think your
wire to me at the time stated that all the other States
were agreeable.
Mr. HUGHES.—I have read what is in my brief.
In substance, I put this question to each of the States:
Are you prepared to cash the bonds of the servants
of your State? From Mr. Holman, in New South
Wales, I got the answer, “Yes.” From Mr. Fihelly’s
State I got the answer, “ Yes.” And from Mr. Lawson
I got the answer “Yes.”
The PRESIDENT.—No.
Mr. HUGHES.—I did. You are not offering any-
thing now. What you say now is that you will accept
those bonds in payment of obligations that the men
are under to you in regard to soldier settlement, if we
will take the bonds from you in payment of what you
owe us. Bless my soul! Where do we come in?
The PRESIDENT.—What the Prime Minister says
is undoubtedly correct, but it is not correct that Vic-
toria has said yes. I told the Prime Minister that we
would consider the matter, and I have asked the
Treasury to let me know what it means to cash these
bonds.
Mr. HUGHES.—That is news to me. What I in-
tend to ask you is, whether every State will pay cash
for the bonds to its own employees. I have several
items before me in regard to revenue and expenditure,
surplus revenue, and Commonwealth and State borrow-
ing, but I shall not deal with these matters now. When,
Mr. President, we were discussing the question of
giving increased powers to the Commonwealth, the
matter of the Surplus Revenue Act was raised, and I
think the Treasurer said that the matter could stand
over until the Convention.
The PRESIDENT.—That was the final arrange-
ment.
Mr. HUGHES. —-Those powers were not granted,
and in several States the Premiers asked that the
powers should not he granted. Consequently, we do
not hold ourselves as bound in any way by the promise
made then, which was entirely contingent on the grant-
ing of the powers. Although there is to be a Oonven-
tion, it is a Convention that was not promised at the
elections, because that Convention related to the
matter of the powers having been granted.
Mr. FIHELLY. —But you are under an obligation
to those States that were willing to grant the powers.
Mr. HUGHES. —I certainly regard them more
favorably, but I do not say that my mind is settled on
the matter at all. The Returned Soldiers and Sailors
Employment Act of 1919 of Hew South Wales is in
conflict with the Commonwealth Repatriation Act.
Then we have the question of the settlement of re-
turned soldiers on the land, including the question of
the treatment of British ex-soldiers, and the question
of forestry. My colleague, the Minister for Repatria-
tion, desires to put'before you a proposal which depends
upon your co-operation in regard to that matter. 1
shall not now anticipate his thesis, but it has the hearty
support of the Government. It is desirable to discuss
uniformity in regard to the standards for drugs, foods,
&c. Then there is the question of the coal control.
Some members of the Commonwealth Parliament do
not believe in Government enterprise. They are sworn
champions of private enterprise, but they have fallen
on evil days quite recently. They have been denounc-
ing Government enterprise, and I have said that we
shall have no more of it. Whereupon they adjured
me, in the name of God not to abandon this most useful
and necessary thing. I have received a request from
the State of Victoria in regard to the coal control. 1
want to hand the matter over to Mr. Lawson, hut still
1 am prepared to discuss it. '
Mr. FIHELLY. —In Queensland we buy our coal
at a lower price than the price fixed by your Board.
Mr. HUGHES. —My own view is perfectly well
known. I think the Board has done good work. The
community has to be rationed.
Mr. SCADDAN.—It is all right at a fair price.
Mr. EIHELLY (to Mr. Hughes).—Our Commission
fixed a lower price than that fixed by your Board.
Mr. HUGHES.—You can run the thing your own
way, and I suggest that the State of Victoria follow
your admirable example.
The PRESIDENT.—I do not think there is any
fear of our doing that.
Mr. HUGHES.—Then there is the matter of rail-
way concessions to officers and men of our fleet, and, I
suppose, the visiting fleet.
The PRESIDENT.—We shall he glad if you will
give us your suggestions as to the small matters.
Mr. HUGHES.—Very well.
Mr. EIHELLY.—Do you propose to give these men
free passages in your Commonwealth ships ?
Mr. HUGHES. —Yes, and we will give you a trip
in any of our ships, but I do not think you will go on
them.
- Mr. EIHELLY.—I might.
Mr. HUGHES.—We have some of our ships going
to distant parts, and you can go on one of them. In
regard to the Murray waters, it will he recollected
that the States interested in this matter —New
South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia —and
the Commonwealth have entered into an agree-
ment in respect to this great national work,
which, of course, involves the expenditure of a con-
siderable sum of money. I do not think money was
ever more wisely expended in this country than on
this scheme. The estimated cost of the scheme was
£4,663,000, of which the Commonwealth was to supply


£1,000,000; New South Wales, £1,221,000; Victoria,
£1,221,000; and South Australia, £1,221,000. The in-
crease in the cost of material and in wages would bring
that amount up another £1,000,000. It is desirable, I
think, for many reasons, that we should expedite this
work. What I ask you is, are you prepared to
do this if it will involve more money? The Common-
wealth is prepared, if you co-operate, to increase its
liability proportionately. We believe it is impera-
tive that the possibilities of the Murray Valley should
be developed, and that this development should be
expedited. It is a great national work, and I can
conceive of none that would pay Australia as a whole,
and the States that are concerned, better. I want
you to turn the matter over in your minds, and to
make yourselves familiar with what has been done,
and is being done, in order that we may discuss the
question on its merits early next week. Clause 5 of
the Agreement limits the Commonwealth expenditure
to £1,000,000, and the heavy increase, therefore, of
necessity, limits the scope of operations and the rate
at which they are being carried out. I am prepared,
on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, to in-
troduce legislation to increase our liability. We will
do everything we can to expedite the work. It will
afford great facilities for land settlement. Wo want
greater power for the Commission in order that tho
work may be expedited. I think, Mr. President, that
I have covered all the matters of major importance.
There is the question of prospecting for oil, in which
we want the co-operation of the States. I think that
Mr. Storey stated in the press, in reply to a suggestion
from myself, that he would assist prospecting for oil
in New South Wales. The matter can be discussed.
Mr. FIHiELLY.—On a £1 for £1 basis?
Mr. HUGHES.—We would do it on that basis. We
have just said that we will give £50,000 to those who
discover payable oil.
Mr. EIHELLY.—To a Government prospecting
would you give £1 for £1 ?
Mr. HUGHES.—I will not commit myself, but if a
State says, “ We are prepared to spend money upon
the condition that the Commonwealth will pay to an
equal amount —£1 for £l,’’ we will consider it. I am
asked by Mr. Lang, “ Does the Commonwealth propose
to take any action in regard to the Surplus Revenue
Act before the forthcoming Convention, or is it pro-
posed to remit the question to that Convention?” It
is certainly not proposed to remit the question to the
Convention. As to whether, we shall take action or not,
that all depends upon circumstances.
The PRESIDENT. —I am sure that we have all
been very much interested in the speech that has been
delivered by the Prime Minister, and perhaps I may
be permitted to say a word or two in reply. The Prime
Minister referred to the question of immigration, and
the necessity for encouraging the right type of
immigrant, and the increasing of production and the
benefit to Australia that would come from a steady flow
of the right class of immigrants. I think everybody
agrees with that. But what we should like to get
from the Prime Minister is a concrete statement of
what his proposition is for the promotion of immigra-
tion. Is it that the Commonwealth desire to take a
more active hand than hitherto in tho promotion of
immigration? Do they propose to create an organiza-
tion at the other side, or what is the definite proposal
which he desires to submit to the States in that regard?
Similarly, in regard to the break of gauge. With the
general propositions which he has enunciated we find
ourselves, I am sure, in complete agreement. But
the Prime Minister must recognise that even to
unify the gauge from Perth to Sydney would
cost, according to the estimate made in 1913,
from £12,000,000 to £13,000,000; and, according
to the information which has come to us since, it
would now cost about double that amount. To make
a uniform railway gauge throughout the whole of the
Commonwealth would cost, according to the estimate
of 1913, between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000. It
would cost twice that amount to-day. What I want to
get from the Prime Minister, apart from the question
of pointing out to us the necessity, the wisdom, and
the convenience which would come to the public if we
had a uniform railway gauge, is whether the Common-
wealth, for example, is prepared to help us in the
financing of such an undertaking. Of course the posi-
tion is accentuated by the present abnormal conditions.
The fact that there is a shortage of shipping, and that
the shipping freights have been raised, has led to an
enormous increase in transport of goods by rail.
Probably this condition will continue, and that there
will be far more inter-i State traffic by rail than hitherto.
That, of course, intensifies the urgency of the matter.
But, as Mr. Hughes has said, we have been dealing
with it for many years, and it is desirable that we should
make some progress in regard to the matter.
However, we are up against the many calls
on the States for money for urgent works,
and the question is whether this can find a place.
In regard to aviation, I take it that what the Prime
Minister is asking is that the States should, by resolu-
tion of their respective Parliaments, surrender the
power to deal with aviation to the Commonwealth
authorities. The line of action which I would suggest
to my fellow Premiers is that there should be legisla-
tion immediately introduced into their different Parlia-
ments, giving power under the Police Regulations Act
to pass regulations which could be immediately put into
operation; that they would control aviation as far as
the States are concerned; and that we should be willing
to surrender the power to the Commonwealth to deal
with what is plainly a National, rather than a State,
matter, reserving to ourselves control over State instru-
mentalities. For instance, assuming that a State for
transport purposes established an air fleet of its own,
it should have control of its own fleet. We should pre-
serve the principle, in regard to State intrumentalities,
that the States should be sovereign in dealing with
these particular matters.
Mr. HUGHES. —All we want is the power to have
uniform laws with regard to air traffic.
The PRESIDENT.—I think that is a desirable
thing. My own feeling would be to recommend the
Premiers to agree to that, with the condition which I
have indicated. As the Prime Minister has said, it is
undoubtedly an Inter-State matter. You cannot have
one set of rules in Victoria, and another in New South
Wales. You must have uniformity, and the best way
is to have the matter controlled by some central autho-
rity. In regard to industrial arbitration, I have at-
tended Conferences before, full of hope that we might
find some solution of that particular problem; that we
might fix a line of demarcation between the State
and the Commonwealth; that certain trades which
are Australian in their character, and in regard to
which we have disputes of an Australian nature, should
be handed over to the Commonwealth, and that we
should say, “ There you shall operate ”; and that those
other trades more domestic in their affairs should be
left to the States. At different Conferences I w r as
hopeful that we might arrive at some solution on those
lines, but, unfortunately, we did seem unable to agree
as States, and we did not seem able to arrive at agree-
ment with the Commonwealth. There are certain


trades which are plainly better handled by the Com-
monwealth, and we could have a list with an elastic
power of extension. There is a mass of discussion be-
hind this question, and a variety of proposals have been
considered from time to time.
hir WALTER LEE. —We made certain definite pro-
posals, but we have not yet I'eeeived any answer from
the Commonwealth Government. That was two years
ago.
Mr. HUGHES.—What about?
The PRESIDENT.—That was us to the fixing of
certain trades which should be brought under the legis-
lative control of the Commonwealth.
Mr. HUGHES.—That hardly touches this particular
point. I agree with that. What I want you to do is
to substitute for the Federal Court a Court on which
there would be some State Judges.
The PRESIDENT.— I am quite sure of this, Mr.
Hughes; That if we get a concrete proposal from your
self, from any of your Ministers, we shall be willing
to consider the matter fully and fairly, with a desire to
arrive at some solution of this vexed and difficult
problem._ Might I take the opportunity to clear up
the position, as far as Victoria is concerned, with regard
to the war gratuity?
Mr. STOREY.—Is it proposed that we should enter
into a discussion of a lengthy character in regard to
what Mr. Hughes has said, or that we should discuss if
after he has gone, and then confer with him again?
He has not given us any proposition.
Mr. HUGHES.—What I was asked to do was to
come here and tell you what I desired you to discuss.
When I come to the discussion on Monday or Tuesday
I will put before you concrete proposals.
Mr. STOREY.—What do you suggest we might do
in the meantime? What I want to know from Mr.
Hughes is how far the Commonwealth Government are
prepared to meet us in the matters to which he has re-
ferred, and whether he desires our co-operation at all,
and, if so, to what extent?
Mr. HUGHES.—Of course, I know you all pretty
well, and although some of us differ in politics, yet, 1
hope we are all good friends; but I am hound to say
that I did not come here just for the sake of seeing you.
I should not have bothered. I think I made it quite
clear that I did want your co-operation. T was pretty
careful to say
Mr. STOREY.—More careful than anything else.
Mix HUGHES.—There is no suggestion of ramming
anything down your throats, even if one had the power.
There are some points on which I am quite willing to
accept any one of 100 alternatives. There are ques-
tions like that of the Industrial Court, the Basic Wage
Commission, and immigration to be discussed. If I
put forward a concrete proposition it would be that
we might discuss some definite thing, and if I believe
that it is the only thing to which the Commonwealth
can agree, I shall say so; hut if it is a matter on which
we are willing to hear what you have to say, and we can
come to an arrangement mutually satisfactory, I will
say that; but I think Mr. Storey will see that it is
physically impossible for me to do anything more than
I have done. I was asked to come here to say what I
proposed to discuss, and I had a memorandum from you
as to when I should come.
Mr. STOREY.—WiII you tell us what you said when
you received our communication?
Mr„ HUGHES. —None of us wants to prolong this
longer than we can help, but we cannot deal with it to-
day. I might leave you now, and perhaps you might
appoint some sub-committee, or in some other way pre-
pare suggestions on some lines which will help us on
Monday.
The PRESIDENT.—I was trying to outline the
position and make a general reply to the statement
which the Prime Minister has made. I was endeavour-
ing to do that on behalf of the Conference.
I did not contemplate that we should have a dis-
cussion of a general nature on the proposal, but
I was endeavouring, with regard to each parti-
cular suggestion of the Prime Minister, to point
out where we have got, and to ask for concrete proposals.
In regard to_ the war gratuity bonds, I take it that
the Prime Minister's request is that all the States
should agree to cash the bonds of their em-
ployees. That is a matter we can fittingly discuss
now that the suggestion has been made. In
connexion with the per capita payments, I want Mr.
Hughes to realize that we as State Premiers stand firm
on this point: At a Conference previously held,
it was decided that the reduction of the per capita
grant should remain in abeyance until after the meet-
ing of the Convention which is to consider amend-
ments of the Constitution. I fail to see how the failure
of the Commonwealth Government to secure' the
endorsement of the proposal for constitutional amend-
ments affects the position if the per capita payments
were to remain as they are at present until the Con-
vention determined what changes should he made.
Mr. HUGHES.—The Convention was contingent
upon the amendments being carried.
The PRESIDENT.—I take it that the Common-
wealth intends to go ahead with its proposal ?
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes. The Conference said they
would not give us these powers permanently but would
give them temporarily, and it was agreed that a Con-
vention should be called before the end of this y©ai
in order that the grant of powers might, be considered.
We said that the per capita payments had nothing
to, do with the Convention, and then w© said that, as
there seemed a good deal of concern about the- posi-
tion, the matter could rest over until after the Conven-
tion, which was to be. called at the end of this year,
to consider the grant of increased powers as suggested
at the referendum.
Mr. FIHELLY. -Why did you not say definitely
that, if the people said “ No',” you would do a certain
thing, and. if they said “ Yes,” you would do something
else ? s
Mr. HUGHES. —What you promised me was that
you would do all you could to get the amendments
through. Take Western Australia for example. Did
Hew do all they could ? The fact of the matter is that
tuey did all they could to 1 lay them out. So. it was in
South Australia. In Victoria we had a sort of eleventh
hour intimation from, the Government that they were in
favour of our proposal.
The PRESIDENT.—That was your own fault; and
if you want the full story about it you can have it.
Mr. FIHELLY.—In Tasmania the Government sup-
ported you, but the people did not. In Western Aus-
tralia the Government did not, hut the people did,
and now both the people and the Government are
condemned.
r ’ HUGHES. The people are always right.
I hey said that the Government of Western Australia
was hopelessly wrong, and they supported it. The
people of Tasmania realized that Sir Walter Lee was
not very keen about it, and they thought they would
show their confidence in him by really voting as he
wished them to do.


The PRESIDENT.- —The Prime Minister is willing
to circulate amongst members of this Conference con-
crete proposals on the various matters which he has
discussed. We will want time to consider them, and
then it will be necessary for us to meet him again.
Mr. HITCHES. —I have also a statement, prepared
by my colleague the Minister for Railways, dealing
with the break of gauge.
Mr. SCADDAN.—We know all there is in the
statement, because the information was obtained from
the States, but we want to know what the Common-
wealth Government propose.
Mr. HUGHES. —What I am saying is, “ Do it.”
The PRESIDENT.—That is all very well for New
South Wales, which has a 4-fi. gauge. In Vic-
toria we shall have to change our gauge, and where
shall we get the money? The change is for the benefit
of Australia.
Mr. HUGHES.—Where do you get money from
now? That is the mystery of the age. My proposal
simply is that if you will co-operate with us wo will
go on with the work.
Mr. STOREY.—We have asked you to help us in
New South Wales with regard to the shortage of coal,
and you say you have' given us eleven ships, but you
do not give us the names.
Mr. HUGHES.—I gave their names to the Com-
monwealth Parliament.
Mr. STOREY.—But we do not know them.
Mr.. FIHELLY.—I have made inquiries, and I
am told there are only eight.
Mr. HUGHES.—I gave the names of eleven vessels,
and I should like to suggest that somebody should
unload those thousand trucks.
Mr. STOREY. —The work cannot he done more
quickly than it is being done now.
Mr. HUGHES.—Oh, yes it can. They are not work-
ing hard now.
Mr. STOREY.—We think they are. You talk about
a train in substitution for a ship, but on© ship will
carry as much as 30 trains. Anyway, New South
Wales has done its part in the matter. It has spent
£15,000 on the third rail, or the attempt to get a
uniform gauge. We did not get your co-operation.
Mr. HUGHES. —With all due respect to you, that
will not go down. The question of the break of gauge
has nothing whatever to do with the ships.
Mr. STOREY,—It is the basis of your argument.
Mr. HUGHES.—It is not the basis of my argument
at all. If you want to carry fodder from the middle
of Victoria to Wagga, do you say that the best way
is to take it down to Melbourne, put it in a ship, take
it round to Sydney, place it in a train, and carry it to
Wagga?
Mr. STOREY.—We do not say anything so
ridiculous.
Mr. HUGHES.—Where is the drought—on the
coast or inland?
Mr. STOREY.—You know that the fodder is not in
the places you suggest, and if you were to give us the
shipping, we could transport it. You are making a
speech about a dozen other things that are no good to
us at the present time. That is the whole position.
Mr. HUGHES.—The vessels that are engaged in
other than deep-sea work—that is, coastal work and
the carriage of phosphates—are the Dinoga, Dromand,
Dilga, Dumosa, Dundula, Delungra, Eudunda, Bulga,
Cooee, Parattah, and Bundarra, In addition to them,
the Bahara has been diverted, and also one of the
“ Austral ” boats. I have sent a cable to obtain quota-
tions for spot cash for three vessels.
9618.—5
Mr. LANG. —What coasts are the vessels you have
mentioned on?
Mr. HUGHES.—On the Australian coast,
Mr. ■ LANG.—That is not helping New South Wales.
Mr. HUGHES.—What have I to do with New
South Wales? I am dealing with Australia. My busi-
ness is to deal with the whole of the continent.
Mr. SCADDAN.—New South Wales is not all
Australia.
Mr. HUGHES.—There are three vessels engaged
in the coal trade between New South Wales and South
Australia. I am met every day in the House by hon-
orable members from Western Australia, Tasmania,
and South Australia, and they ask for coal and fodder.
I have to consider those States as much as New South
Wales. As a matter of fact, most of those vessels do
go to New South Wales, because they have to bring
coal back again.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Can we be assured of this—that
the shipping owned by the Commonwealth Government
will be restricted to the Australian coastal trade so
long as the shipping shortage lasts ?
Mr. HUGHES.—No. The vessels that I have men-
tioned will be. The Bakara and the Australgl tn are
the only two other of our vessels that are near Aus-
tralia, and they have been given instructions by wire-
less. On© is to go to Adelaide to pick up cargo and
fodder, and take it to New South Wales, and is to
bring coal back. I have asked Mr. Eva to taring a
further vessel—one of the Auatrals—into Fremantle.
When you are dealing with ships you are dealing with
things scattered all over the world, and they cannot
be brought here at a moment’s notice. I want to say
here, as I said to the Parliament of the Common-
wealth, that we have lost and are losing every day
heavily on coastal trade. We are losing thousands and
tens of thousands of pounds.
Mr. CANN.—There are thousands of head of Stock
that we are losing that might be saved if we had these
ships.
Mr. HUGHES.—The vessels are on that business.
I read out their names.
Mr. CANN.—If you were to place the thirty-seven
ships on the coastal trade you would more than save
in stock what you are losing on the coastal trade.
Mr. HUGHES.—That is why they are on that
trade.
Mr. CANN.—There are ten out of the thirty-seven
on it.
Mr. HUGHES.—But we have not thirty-seven
vessels.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You have thirty-nine.
Mr. HUGHES.—We have to carry the farmers’ pro-
duce from here to Europe to sell it.
Mr. SCADDAN.—You have to lose sight of the New
South Wales boundaries sometimes.
Mr. HUGHES.—I do not know whether the mem-
bers of the Conference realize that, whereas the war
did not destroy one truck, it destroyed 9,000,000 tons
of British shipping, and that there are fifteen ships
short on the coast of Australia, even with ours on.
Mr. FIHELLY.—And we have been selling some
to Japan.
Mr. HUGHES.—That sort of statement is not true.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I will tell you about it in a
moment.
Mr. HUGHES.—If you can show me that I have
given permission to sell* a ship to Japan 1 will give
you a ship. If we were to put on the whole of our
line at coastal work—some of the vessels are quite un-
suitable for that work—the shipping companies would
go off.
Mr. SCADDAN.-—And somebody else Would suffer
by not being able to export to other countries.


Mr. HUGHES.—This country would be absolutely
under the domination of the Inchcape combine. The
freights would go up with a leap, and there would be
a tremendous outcry here. The freights from Aus-
tralia to Europe are much lower than the freights for
any corresponding distance, as a result of the competi-
tion of the Commonwealth Line; and I am astounded
to hear men who believe, as I do, in governmental
enterprises, doing all they can to destroy the only means
of checking the great Combine which has been sweating
the Australian producer as long as I can remember.
Mr. CANN.—No one has suggested such a thing.
Mr. HUGHES.—You suggested it.
Mr. FIHELLY.—The hour is late, so I will not
occupy more than two or three minutes. I will reserve
other aspects of the question for discussion at a later
stage, but on the matter of ships being sold to the East,
what I said was true. The Prime Minister contra-
dicted my statement. I say deliberately that it is true,
and that what I stated happened in the case of a ship
that was actually under charter to the Queensland
Government. The moment the charter expired the
ship was sold to the East, and I am sure it went to
Japan. It should not have left Australia. The Prime
Minister has referred to the tonnage lost during tho
war. Prior to the war, the Australian Government
owned no ships, and now it owns 39. Whilst there is
a shortage of shipping on the coast, we should use our
ships as much as we can, and we should not let a ship
go to the East. That ship was sold with the absolu-
tion of the Commonwealth Government.
Mr. HUGHES.—What ship?
Mr. FIHELLY. —I will tell you afterwards. I do
not care to drag in the name of any company. We had
the ship under charter, and we were making £5,000 a
year out of it. It was sold at a tremendous profit to
the East.
Mr. HUGHES. —You should tell me the name of the
ship. Was it sold to Japan?
Mr. FIHELLY.—I said to the East. You said that
you had only 37 ships, and you have 39.
Mr. HUGHES.- —-The ex-enemy ships are the subject
of decision by the International Board as to whether
they shall remain with us.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You are operating them.
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes: I want to know from you
the name of the ship that was sold.
Mr. EITCHIE. —I think it was the Allinga.
Mr. HUGHES.—I think I know the Allinga. In-
structions have been given that no ships are to be sold
from the coast. We took control of the coastal com-
panies’ ships, and as the result we lost about £300,000.
Mr. FIHELLY. —The shipping companies made
very big profits.
Mr. HUGHES. —I do not know how they made
them. We have to use one of these ships for deep-sea
work, and we made as much on one as we lost on ten or
twelve coastal ships. There are 22 ex-enemy ships—
-11 Australs and 7 built here —making, with one sailing
ship, 41 altogether. The Allinga did not comply with
the navigation Act requirements, and, in that case,
permission was given to sell. lam sure it was not sold
to Japan. I would not have that at all. I have sent
instructions to our brokers in Europe to try to buy
ships, and will buy them at any price. I told Parlia-
ment yesterday, or the day before, what we had done,
and I said that when an offer was given to me I would
buy. Ships aro at a tremendous price, but I hope the
price will come down, because' ships are being built all
over the world.
Sir WALTEE LEE.—I think before this question
of the shipping was brought in we were discussing the
procedure to be adopted to arrive at a solution of the
problems before us. We are not getting any nearer to
it. Can we come to some understanding so that we may
arrive at a conclusion? Again and again we meet at
these Conferences without arriving at finality. We
may expedite the discussion of some subjects if we meet
this afternoon. There are some questions on the agenda
paper on which the States are asked to state their
attitude. If we wait until Monday in order to have the
printed views of the Prime Minister we shall not he
very far ahead. The morning will be gone before we
have adequately thrashed out even one subject, and the
Conference will be compelled to close down without
having arrived at any finality. We ought to deal with
the five subjects on the agenda paper that will demand
a great deal of discussion and consideration. We should
meet this afternoon, and come to some agreement as to
the attitude we are going to adopt in regard to these
questions. In that way we shall be able to expedite oui
work.
Mr. STOEEY.—Whilst I agree with what Sir Walter
Lee has said, I would prefer that the statements of Mr.
Hughes were in print before us, so that there could be
no possibility of dispute. I am not too sure about those
statements. I am ready to discuss all the subjects
enumerated by Mr. Hughes, because I have all the data.
May I say, further, that the question of the third rail
is as common to people in this country as the noon-
day sun. Everybody knows the cost of that. There
is no need to discuss that at any length. It is only a
question of determining as to who shall be the con-
trolling body in future.
Mr. HUGHES.—The question is really one of con-
venience.
Mr. STOEEY.—We have the figures as to the cost.
Therefore, it is only a question of money, and of how
far the Commonwealth is prepared to meet the various
States. The other questions mentioned by the Prime
Minister are similarly known to us all. What we aro
concerned with are the points that have not been touched
upon, or only just touched upon, such as that of the per
capita payment, which vitally affects the States as re-
gards the very matters in which we are asked to co-
operate with the Commonwealth. Until we know how
we shall stand financially in the future, it is impossible
for us to commit our various States. If we can ob-
tain a definite statement from the Commonwealth on
that matter, we shall be in a better position to discuss
questions of finance. The Prime Minister said he- had
received an application from Hew South Wales. Be-
cause of that we earned the evident hostility of Mr.
Scaddan and others, and w T e are charged with being
parochial, and of thinking only of Hew South Wales.
We did not raise the question. The Prime Minister
did. The Prime Minister then went into the question
of the break of gauge, and referred to the number of
trucks that have to be loaded at Albury. We are aware
of that, and we_ are not asking any concession in the
matter of shipping. In fact, if I can get the assent
of my Parliament, I am going to get my own ships
rather than put up with the tyranny of the combine.
We ought to know, in black and white, just where wc
stand. We ask for nothing in Hew South Wales,
but I would point out that other States are in a
better position. Owing to xho drought in Hew South
Wales, we find it difficult to keep our stock alive. What
we want is to be able to secure from Victoria or other
States those things which are essential to sustenance in
Hew South Wales. If we ask for assistance in that
matter, it is no more than other States ask when they
are suffering in the way that Hew South Wales is suf-
fering at present. The injury caused by the drought
in Hew South Wales affects Australia as a whole, par-
ticularly in view of the shipping difficulties. I do not
ask for any time to consider these questions. There
should be no charge against us of parochialism because
of the fact that we are suffering. I say, with Sir
Walter Lee, that we should meet on Monday morning,


but that we could not go into details. The Prime Min-
ister said, “ We could go to a place that is warmer.”
Mr. HUGHES.—I said nothing of the sort. Ido
not think that any of the gentlemen present require
any suggestion from me as to where they are going.
Mr. STOREY.—In the main, we are in agreement
on most subjects. The question of the break of gauge
does not affect Tasmania, though the Tasmanian repre-
sentatives are, lam sure, ready to discuss it. The cost
of a uniform gauge is known to all of us. Various
have been made. There is that of unify-
ing the main lines, leaving the others to be determined
as money is provided. That is a simple solution, but
are we ready to go ahead, and can we get the Federal
Government’s co-operation ?
Mr. HUGHES.—I have told you that in all these
things we are ready to go on and to provide our quota
of money.
Mr. STOREY.—That is definite enough. I will
say no more on that point. I think we should now
adjourn till ten o’clock on Monday morning.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I have gone through the
agenda paper, and I find that practically every item
on it has been suggested by the States for considera-
heading, ‘ Subjects which the Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth desires to discuss with the Conference,”
but nearly ©very on© of these suggestions was put up
by the State Governments for consideration. The ob-
ject we had in view was that the State Governments
should express their views at this Conference on these
particular matters, and that we should submit them to
the Commonwealth. I claim that we arei putting our-
selves in an entirely false' position. We say we cannot
discuss anything until the Prime Minister, on behalf
of the Federal Government, tells us what he wants us
to do. We have met for a different purpose. W©
have met to express our collective views on those mat-
ters which are of mutual interest to us, and to make
certain representations to the Commonwealth Govern-
ment on behalf of the States which are represented.
Again and again w© find ourselves in the position that
w© sit down and do nothing, and we ask the Prime
Minister of the Commonwealth what he wants us to
do. I say the position should be taken from another
point of view altogether. The States’ representatives
are here to discuss questions which affect the States in-
dividually and collectively, and to express to the Com-
monwealth our views on those questions. I contend
that we are getting away from the original intention of
Conferences such as this. There is the question of the
Commonwealth Constitution and the proposed Conven-
tion for the revision of the Constitution. There is the
question of industrial legislation. W© have waited
for that, and may wait until we are black in
the face unless we emphasize the matter. We have
passed resolutions and submitted them to the Common-
wealth, and are expecting a, reply. We do not get it,
and I say that on each of these questions these Con-
ferences, composed of State Premiers, should be pre-
pared to consider them from the point of view of how
they affect the States, and that we should make our
representations to the Commonwealth in respect of
them. W© should not meet here simply to ask the
Commonwealth Government what they want us to do.
I think that we might, this afternoon, very well settle
down to a discussion on these matters with a view to
making our representations as a Conference to the Com-
monwealth Government. We should not wait until
Monday in order to find out just what the Prime Min-
ister wants us to do. What we have met to discuss are
the things that we want done.
Mr. SCADDAN. —Cannot we hear from the Prime
Minister as to when he is likely to come back?
The PRESIDENT. —The Prime Minister will come
at half-past 2 o’clock on Monday.
Mr. HUGHES. —Sir Walter Lee’s observations are,
I think, a little uncalled for. Whatever business
brought you here is, of course, best known to your-
selves. I am not interfering with that. I took the
liberty, if it was a liberty, of sending to the various
States an agenda-paper suggesting matters that I
should like to speak to the States about. .Some of
them are subjects which you yourselves would have
spoken of anyhow. You arrange the procedure as you
like. I am prepared to put concrete propositions be-
fore you, and you can say “ Yes ” or you can say
“No”; or we may come to some modus vivendi. All
I have to say is that in everything which I have
brought forward that involves the expenditure of
money, the Commonwealth is prepared, if it can come
to an agreement with you, to find its quota.
Mr. STOREY.—WiII you forgive me if I say that,
although you mentioned all those items, you made no
proposition ?
Mr. HUGHES.—No; because the time did not per-
mit it. I could have dealt with one matter, and no
more. The first subject which I will deal with when
I come again will be immigration, the next will be
the break of gauge difficulty, and then there will be
the question of the Murray waters.
The PRESIDENT.—I understand that you propose
to give us a statement of the concrete proposals of the
Commonwealth Government in regard to each of those
subject-matters.
Mr. HUGHES. —Yes.
The PRESIDENT.—WeII, it is a question of the
most convenient way to deal with our business. There
are certain subjects in which the Commonwealth and
the States are jointly interested, and we want front
Mr. jHughes, and I understand he is prepared to sup-
ply, a definite statement of how far the Common-
wealth is prepared to go, and what its suggestions are
for State co-operation. If we get that, we can dis-
cuss the matters more profitably. This afternoon we
could discuss one or two matters in regard to which
we have enough information, and the intentions of the
Commonwealth are sufficiently well known. There
are also some matters on the agenda-paper which are
of -purely State concern. It is a question of the Com-
monwealth getting this information as early as pos-
sible. If we could get that information to-night, the
members of the Conference would have an opportunity
of considering it before we meet on Monday morning.
We will discuss the matters then, and meet Mr. Hughes
at 2.30.
Mr. HARWELL.—Is it possible to get the informa-
tion printed and delivered at our hotels to-night?
Mr. HUGHES. —No; this is Saturday, and the staff
is not available. I will try to let you have it, although
it clearly involves a desecration of the Sabbath, by
the time you meet on Monday, or earlier if possible.
I think it will be sufficient for my purpose if I can do
so by then, on two or three of the main questions. We
can supply the others later on.
Mr. STOREY. —Will you include in that number
the per capita question?
Mr. HUGHES.—No.
Mr. STOREY.—I move—
That the Conference adjourn until 10 a.m. on Monday.
Sir WALTER LEE.—As an amendment, I move —
That the Conference adjourn until half-past 2 o’clock this
afternoon.
We have already an .indication on one matter that
affects the State very materially, and that is the per
capita question.
The amendment was agreed to, and at 1.40 p.m. the
Conference adjourned until 2.30 p.m.


CASHING OF WAR GRATUITY BONDS.
The PRESIDENT.—WouId you be prepared to move,
Mr. Mitchell, at the request of the Prime Minister, that
the question of cashing war gratuity bonds held by em-
ployees of the State Governments be referred to the
various Governments for their consideration, and that
they advise the Federal authorities ?
Mr. MITCHELL.—I am prepared to move that.
Mr. BARWELL.—We ought to come to a common
agreement.
Mr. LANG. —New South Wales has already agreed
to pay cash to soldier employees.
Mr. BARWELL.—We have definitely decided the
matter in regard to soldier employees, but we are be-
ginning to find out what we are committed to.
The PRESIDENT.—There is only one way in which
we can get unanimity, and that is for all of us to pay.
Sir WALTER LEE.—How many States have de-
cided to do so ?
The PRESIDENT. —New South Wales and Queens-
land.
Mr. SCADDAN.—The Federal Government’s idea is
that if the State Governments would undertake to cash
the war gratuity of their employees, he would en-
deavour to induce employers throughout Australia te
do likewise. The Commonwealth Government could not
possibly pay in cash to all the soldiers, as it would be
too big a strain on the finances of the country. But te
my mind, if the Commonwealth Government provide
cash, as far as their employees are concerned, and each
State as far as its employees are concerned, it really
comes to the same thing. How are we to find the
cash ?
Mr. MlTCHELL.—Thousands of soldiers are going
on the land, and thousands of others are setting up in
business.
Mr. SCADDAN.—If the State Governments are pre-
pared to act on the basis suggested by Sir Elliott Lewis,
wo might get over the difficulty.
Mr. MITCHELL.—Our sinking fund is invested in
trustees in London, and they would have to determine
whether they would take these bonds. Each State
must consider the matter according to its own circum-
stances. I think the only thing we can do is to tefer
the question to the individual States.
Sir WALTER LEE. —I think it desirable that we
should arrive at unanimity in regard to this matter
I think the Premier must realize that, if one or more
States are doing this thing, the others must come into
line.
Mr. SCADDAN.—We cannot do the impossible.
Mr. MITCHELL.—I propose that the matter be re-
ferred to the various Governments.
Mr. BARWELL.—How will you get uniformity?
Mr. MITCHELL. —By correspondence.
The PRESIDENT.—I can tell you how we could
make an effort to secure uniformity. The States which
are still standing out and have not notified their ac-
quiescence with the Commonwealth Government pro-
posals could exchange views before they finally advise
the Federal authorities.
Mr. MITCHELL.—That is so. I move—
That the request of the Prime Minister in regard to cashing
war gratuity bonds of State employees by the respective State
Governments be referred to the State Governments for con-
sideration; that these Governments exchange views in an
endeavour to obtain uniformity of action; and that the
Premier of Victoria be advised of the views of the respective
Governments.
The motion was agreed to.
COAL CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I move—
That in view of the serious shortage of coal in certain
States, the Prime Minister be requested to render every pos-
sible assistance to overcome the shortage, and, in the mean-
time, to continue the coal control.
Mr. BARWELL seconded the motion, which was
carried, Queensland dissenting from the request for the
continuance of control.
AVIATION.
On the item “ Aviation—To be regulated by Com-
monwealth legislation, not by individual States,”
The PRESIDENT said—You have heard the re-
quest of the Prime Minister for unanimity in regard to
this matter. Of course, it is possible to pass uniform
legislation and uniform regulations in all the States.
That means machinery in all the States to deal with
the matter. It seems to me a matter to be dealt with
by the Commonwealth Parliament, inasmuch as the
Commonwealth would control the aerial defence forces.
I have drafted a motion for consideration. In the
meantime, as it would take some time to put legislation
through all the State Parliaments, I think we might
arrange, by a slight amendment of the Police Offences
Act, or whatever Act regulates matters of traffic in the
different States, to take steps to pass regulations and
to promulgate them to enable us to act in connexion
with aerial displays. The Air Convention prevents
trick flying and acrobatics in the' air over cities and
towns and populous places, and there is some necessity
for control right away. The States could take that
action pending National legislation. Wo are safe-
guarding the rights of the States to regulate any air
craft which they may establish for their, own purposes.
Mr. SCADDAN moved —
That it is desirable that each of the Parliaments of the
States should refer to the Parliament of the Commonwealth,
pursuant to section 51 (xxxvii) of the Commonwealth of
Australia Constitution Act, the matter of the control of
aviation, but so as not to restrict—
(а) the control by the State of air-craft owned or used
by the Government of the State, so far as the same
is operated within the State; or
(б) the police powers of the State.
Mr. CANN seconded the motion.
The PRESIDENT.—This is an affirmation of the
principle. It may ho that when the draftsman comes
to consider the form the reference should take, some
technical alterations may he required.
Sir WALTER LEE. —I have some notes prepared
by the Attorney-General in our Cabinet. On looking
through them somewhat hurriedly, I am inclined to
think that the proposed resolution covers the points
which he has raised as to the necessity of retaining
control over air craft which may be used solely within
the State. He points out that to hand over these
powers would he somewhat analogous to surrendering
legislative control of the railways and harbors within
the State. I take it that the motion is designed to
retain that control in the hands of the State.
Mr. BARWELL. —-The motion exempts from Com-
monwealth control only air craft owned by State Go-
vernments. There might he a privately owned service be-
tween Launceston and Hobart, which would be subject
to Federal control.
Sir WALTER LEE. —Of course, that is a debatable
point. Our Attorney-General refers to that fact, that
local bodies may he interested. Who would control
the services under those circumstances?
Mr. BARWELL. —Under this motion, the Common-
wealth would. The question requires more considera-
tion than we can give in a moment.
Sir WALTER LEE. —I recognise that, in a general
way, the Commonwealth must have very wide powers
over aviation. There is no getting away from that
fact. At the same time, wo should be careful, because
we do not want to he in the position of handing over
something that would he analogous to handing over in-
ternal railways and harbors. If this motion fully
covers that, I have no objection.


Mr. BABWELL.—The President, Sir Elliott Lewis,
and myself were appointed a Committee to go into
this matter, and we met for only a few moments this
morning. We did not finalize matters, and I suggest
that the question he still left in the hands of that Com-
mittee. We might meet at 9.30 on Monday morning
and consider whether we should not exempt from Fede-
ral control air craft owned and used by private com-
panies operating entirely within the State. The reso-
lution limits the exemption to air craft used by a State
Government.
The FEESIDEHT. —If you do that, you must have
State machinery to deal with the matter, and there
would he duplication in all the States. There could
be one central authority dealing with it throughout
Australia. It is linked up with the question of
defence.
Mr. BABWELL.—It is principally a matter of
policing. However, I think that the matter is one that
should not be decided off-hand, and that it should still
be left in the hands of the Committee. I therefore
move —
That the debate be adjourned.
Sir WALTEE LEE.—Could the difficulty be got
over by the addition of a few words to the motion?
The PEESIDEHT. —The Committee could do that
more properly than the whole Conference.
The motion for the adjournment of the debate was
agreed to.
EEPEESEHTATIOH AT IMPEETAL
EOEESTEY COHEEEEHOE.
The PEESIDEHT.—I think we might now take
the report of the Committee on forestry matters.
Mr. HUTCHIHSOIST.—This morning, the Ministers
of Forests met and considered certain resolutions that
were carried at the Forestry Conference in Hobart last
month. _ The Committee submits three resolutions for
the consideration of this Conference. The first has re-
ference to the Imperial Conference to be held in
London in July next. It was decided at the Hobart
Conference that it was desirable to send two repre-
sentatives from Australia. The position has been a
little complicated as far as the States are concerned.
For instance, this State had decided not to send a
special representative, but to appoint its Agent-Gene-
ral. The Home authorities and our Attorney-General
were so advised. This is a new proposition. It is nqt
for State representation, but the representation of Aus-
tralia ; and the Hobart Conference made its recommen-
dation to the Prime Minister. The other day, the
Prime Minister wrote stating that, with reference to
the Imperial Forestry Conference, which is to be held
in London, during July, in connexion with the British
Empire Timber Exhibition, the Hobart Conference
had recommended, and the Commonwealth Govern-
ment had approved of, Mr. E. Lane Poole, of Western
Australia, and Mr. H. E. Mac Kay, of Victoria, attend-
ing the Conference as delegates, and that the Secretary
of State for the Colonies had been advised by cable
accordingly. We all thought that that meant the ac-
ceptance by the Commonwealth of Australian repre-
sentation, and that the Commonwealth Was carrying
the whole cost. We were undeceived yesterday when a
second letter came to hand, in which the Prime Min-
ister informed the various States that the Common-
wealth Government would bear half the expense of
sending two delegates to the Conference in question.
The decision was discussed this morning by the Min-
isters of Forests, and they decided to make the fol-
lowing recommendation:—
Imperial Forest Conference. —It is recommended that tide
Conference indorses the resolution of the Inter-State Forestry
Conference, that two delegates be sent to represent Australia
at the forthcoming Imperial Conference on Forestry, and ac-
cepts the offer of the Commonwealth Government to pay half
the expenses, the States to boar the remaining half on a
population basis.
Eoughly, the cost would be about £l,OOO, which would
that the States would, on a population basis,
contribute £5OO. The second resolution is with regard
to the establishment of an Australian Forestry School.
It is as follows:
Australian Forestry School. —l. It is recommended to this
• Conference that there shall be established an Australian
School of Forestry for the training of officers in the profession
of forestry, and that this school be established in New South
Wales.
Most of the States have a school in some form or
other, these .schools are not carrying far enough,
the difficulty of the Department is to get in Aus-
tralia trained foresters and experts. The Hobart Con-
ference re-affirmed the decision arrived at by a
Forestry Conference in Perth, in 1917, that it was
desirable to establish a fully equipped forestry school
for the complete training of scientific foresters, and
that the school should be established in Hew South
Wales. That State was selected because it offered the
greatest variety in climate and timber. It was re-
garded hy experts that, in regard to these two points,
both climate and timber would be found in Hew South
Wales similar to that in almost any other part of Aus-
tralia, and, consequently, it is recommended that there
should he an Australian School of Forestry for the
training of men in forestry, and that the school should
he established in Hew South Wales. The second re-
solution is as follows;
It is recommended that the control of the school he vested
in a Council constituted by the appointment of an equal
number of representatives of each State and the Common-
wealth; provided that the cost of establishment be met by
contributions from the States on a population basis, and a
subsidy from the Commonwealth on the basis of one-sixth of
the gross total contributions from the States.
Addendum. —lt is estimated that the cost of establishment
should not exceed £12,000, and that the cost of maintenance
should not exceed £6,000 per annum, this estimate being based
upon the assumption that no charge is made for training and
instruction at the school.
The sum of £6,000 is regarded as the maximum. The
students will, of course, have to pay for their mainten-
ance in the college. The third recommendation is as
follows:
The forestry authorities of the various States estimate that
to meet the future requirements of Australia a forest area
of 24,500,000 acres will be necessary, this estimate being
based upon the following distribution among the States:—
Queensland .. .. .. ~ 6,000,000
New South Wales .. .. .. 8,000,000
Victoria .. .. ~ ~ i5,50o’()00
South Australia .. .. .. 500,000
Western Australia . . . . .. 3,000 000
Tasmania .. .. '. j’soo’ooo
It is recommended that this Conference indorses the desira-
bility of aiming at the reservation of this area.
The fixing of this area certainly means looking ahead,
because it is based on tbe requirements of a popula-
tion of 20,000,000. Experts say that, in order to pro-
vide for the requirements of such a population, it is
necessary that the whole of that area should be per-
manently reserved in Australia. The Committee
thinks these are wise provisions to make, and that they
ought to he carried out. I should like to ask whether
the Conference would like to discuss the recommenda-
tions one at a time now, or whether members would
prefer to adjourn consideration until Monday, so that
they may have time to think over them.
Mr. HEAH.—I move—
That the recommendations of the Committee be taken into
consideration forthwith.
Mr. MITCHELL seconded the motion, which was
agreed to.


Mr. HE AN. —In submitting the first recommenda-
tion to this Conference, I should like, as Chairman of
the Inter-State Conference, which previously considered
this matter, to intimate that we have already impressed
upon the Prime Minister the necessity of sending to
England two delegates who have a full knowledge of
forestry , and who also possess adequate information
in regard to the requirements of the Commonwealth.
We also emphasized the fact that this was a national
matter, and we therefore impressed upon the Prime
Minister the importance of the Commonwealth bearing
a portion of the cost of the delegation which might go
to London. I have not yet received any communica-
tion in regard to the suggestion that the States should
bear half the expense, but I presume it has been sent
to Tasmania. I am, however, certain in my own mind
that the carrying ont of this proposal will be of such
advantage to forestry throughout the Commonwealth
that the States should he prepared to pay half the cost
of the delegation, and I hope that this Conference will
agree to the recommendation. I move' —
That the first recommendation be adopted.
Mr. SCADDAN seconded the motion.
Mr. JONES.—In the absence of Mr. Coyne, who
has forestry under his administration in Queensland,
I should like to he informed whether the Committee
which brought up these recommendations were
unanimous ?
Mr. SCADDAN.—AII the recommendations of the
Committee were carried unanimously.
The PRESIDENT.—If we carry this resolution, does
it mean that all the States agreeing must pay on the
population basis ?
Mr. HEAN.—Yes.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I move—
That the second recommendation be adopted.
We have recently passed a Forest Act in Western Aus-
tralia, which provides for the preservation of the exist-
ing forests. We started out with various working
plans, and then looked around for a man to carry them
out. We had great difficulty in selecting a suitable
man. We could not get one in Australia, but we even-
tually found an Australian who had been receiving
training in France. The time has arrived when we
should treat this industry in the way it should have
been dealt with years ago. We must have trained
officers of our own, and we must establish a school
where the training can be successfully carried
out. If we were to have a school in each State we
should probably not get sufficient students to keep it
going, and, therefore, it is desirable to have only one
school, and as far as we can see the best place for it to
be established is in New South Wales. The States
which have to send students to the school there will
probably have to provide boarding allowance, and to
that extent the contributions to the maintenance of the
school will be increased. But the advantages of the
scheme are so good that the States can well afford to
do that much.
Mr. RITCHIE seconded the motion.
The PRESIDENT.—I should like to understand
how far the adoption of this undertaking will take us.
It is proposed that we should establish a School of
Forestry in New South Wales, and that the Common-
wealth should subsidize the cost to the extent of one-
sixth. The question is, if forests are a matter of State
control, how far we are justified in asking the Com-
monwealth to contribute to the cost?
Mr. SCADDAN. —The control of forests is a State
matter, but the future supply of hardwoods and other
timbers is a national question.
The PRESIDENT. —There is no doubt that it is an
Australian matter. Is it intended that the indorse-
ment of this resolution will hind the respective Govern-
ments? We have not had an opportunity of consider-
ing this proposition in Cabinet.
Mr. RITCHIE. —These resolutions, I understand,
are in a large measure affirming the opinions of experts
who met at the recent Hobart Conference.
Mr. HEAN. —All the States were represented.
Mr. RITCHIE. —Yes. There were one or two
points upon which I felt a little doubt myself, as we
left our State immediately after the return of the
South Australian representatives; hut I am given to
understand that the States were unanimous in the
decisions that were arrived at, and those decisions are
now passed on for the indorsement of the Conference.
Mr. HUTCHINSON.—It is a fair thing to include
the Commonwealth. It is realized that each State has
a responsibility for its forests, but the Commonwealth,
as has been pointed out, has the Federal Capital Terri-
tory —there are big forest possibilities there—and it
also has the Northern Territory and Papua. They all
contain timber propositions. The Commonwealth is
directly interested, and should be a contributing factor.
Mr. SCADDAN. —May I also point out that the
Commonwealth have already shown their earnestness in
the forest industry generally by agreeing, on the recom-
mendation of the Council of Science and Industry, to
establish a forest products laboratory, and they are
carrying a fair burden of expense —not only one-sixth.
I think it will he found that they will accept our recom-
mendation as being a very modest one. I should not be
surprised of they were to offer, without any suggestion
from us, to pay one-half the cost.
The PRESIDENT. —Is it intended that this resolu-
tion should hind the various State Governments?
Mr. SCADDAN. —It cannot hind them. '
The PRESIDENT.—I do not feel able, without full
consideration, to commit the Victorian Government to
join in this. The Minister of Forests himself has
scarcely had an opportunity to confer with the dele-
gates since the Hobart Conference was held. With the
reservation that this resolution is a recommendation to
the various Governments, I am prepared to agree to it.
We understand that there is that reservation.
Mr. SCADDAN. —This decision will follow the usual
routine. It will go through the senior Premier to the
State Governments, and they will indorse it or other-
wise.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. RITCHIE.—I move—
That the third recommendation be adopted.
Although South Australia is a big State, it is given the
humble area of 500,000 acres to put in. That is all we
are supposed to put in; hut I think we shall do very
much better than that.
The motion was agreed to.
PERSONAL EXPLANATION.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I Should like to make a
personal explanation apropos of the discussion with
the Prime Minister on Monday. I gathered during
the luncheon hour that I had created the impression,
when I was advocating that the Conference should dis-
cuss the questions listed by the various States, come
to a conclusion and submit them to the Prime Minister,
that I meant that that was to he the end of it. I hope
I did not convey that impression to the members of
the Conference, for it was not my intention. I meant
that, having met here to consider certain propositions,
we should express our opinions on them, submit those
propositions to the Prime Minister, and then confer
with him in the hope of coming to an agreement.
The Conference adjourned at twenty minutes to
five o’clock p.m. until ten o’clock on Monday morning,

TELEGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE
BETWEEN PREMIERS.
The PRESIDENT. —I have to present a report of
the Officers’ Committee with regard to the use of a
more convenient and economical code in telegraphic
correspondence between Premiers. It is as follows: —
The Committee of officers deputed to inquire into this
matter are of opinion that the situation could be met by the
use of Bentley’s (public) code, and by an arrangement be-
tween the States for—
(a) Several key words indicating how the message is to be
read; and
(b) The compilation of an Australian supplement con-
taining words and phrases in constant use between
Governments, but which are not now included in
Bentley’s code.
Both these could be arranged by correspondence.
The matter has been fully considered by the Officers’
Committee, and I am advised that there will be no
difficulty in arranging for suitable key words and for
the simplification of the code. I think we might
accept the report of the Officers’ Committee, and indorse
the recommendations. The subject was suggested for
consideration by Queensland.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I move—
That the report be adopted.
Mr. STOREY seconded the motion, which was
agreed to.
PRIME MINISTER’S SUGGESTIONS.
Immigration—Uniform Railway Gauge—Murray
Waters Scheme.
The PRESIDENT. —Pursuant to the arrangement
made by the Prime Minister, he has now submitted
suggestions on three subjects which he discussed with
us on Saturday last. They are as follows:
IMMIGRATION.
Outline of Suggested Scheme.
Commonwealth to have full control overseas.
Agents-General of the several States to form consultative
Committee in London.
■Commonwealth to be responsible for, and have control of,
all overseas organizations and transport arrangements for
bringing immigrants to Australia.
Primary object of scheme to be the settlement of immi-
grants on the lands of Australia.
Type of immigrant; Preference to be given to British ex-
service men. Commonwealth to seek co-operation and as-
sistance of British Government in obtaining right type of
immigrant, and of passages for same.
Commonwealth to assume financial responsibility for organi-
zation for immigrants from overseas and transport to
Australia.
The States to be responsible for immigrants from arrival
in Australia, and for their settlement on suitable lands
and/or employment on public works.


States to_ enter into an agreement with the Common-
wealth, setting out in definite terms what they bind them-
selves to do in regard to providing—
(a) Land.
(b) Other forms of assistance such as depots, sustenance,
general care of immigrants, employment on public
works, particularly on unification of railways gauge
and Murray waters scheme, &c.,
for (1) ex-service men; (2) other classes of immigrants.
UNIFORM GAUGE.
Outline of Suggested Scheme.
Work to ha put in hand immediately to connect the State
Capitals from Brisbane to Perth with a 4 ft. 8i in. gauge.
Mainland States to contribute cost on a per capita basis.
The Commonwealth to contribute a quota.
Work to be placed under the control of a Commission com-
posed of one commissioner appointed by the Commonwealth
and two selected by the States.
Commonwealth to make financial arrangements for raising
the money by issuing non-negotiablo bonds for a fixed period.
States to pay interest on their respective quotas, and to
redeem bonds when they mature.
MURRAY WATERS.
Outline of Suggested Proposal,
Work to be greatly expedited.
Commonwealth, which has already a liability of £1,000,000,
to increase this to one-fourth of the total cost.
The scope and powers of the Commission to be greatly
widened, and the Commission to be given full power to press
on with the work with, a view to completing same at the
earliest possible date.
In order to conserve the public interests and promote
speedy settlement, power to be given to the Commission to
resume all land affected by the scheme, at any time during
progress of the scheme, and for < years thereafter at
present value plus per cent.
This great national work to be utilized in connexion with
the immigration scheme by .providing opportunities for em-
ployment for immigrants.
Preference of employment to be given first to Australian
soldiers.
Commonwealth and States concerned to pass necessary
legislation for increased expenditure, and for otherwise giving
effect to above scheme without delay.
The Conference went into Committee to consider th«
recommendations.
MURRAY WATERS.
The PRESIDENT.—I desire to present to the Con-
ference a report of the Committee on the Murray
River proposals submitted by the Prime Minister, and
I move that it he adopted. The report is as follows;
1. Work to be greatly expedited.
Committee’s report.—Yes.
2. Commonwealth, which has already a liability of
£1,000,000, to increase this to one-fourth of the total cost.
Committee’s report.—Yes.
3. The scope and powers of the Commission to bo greatly
widened, and the Commission to be given full power to press
on with the work, with a view to completing same at the
earliest possible date.
Committee’s report.—Further information to be ob-
tained. States prepared to consider any proposal.
4. In order to conserve the public interests and promote
speedy settlement, power to be given to the Commission to
resume all land affected by the scheme, at any time during
the progress of the scheme, and for years* thereafter, at
present value plus per cent.
Committee’s report.—ln order to conserve the public
interests and promote speedy settlement, power to be
given to the Commission, on the request of the State
concerned, to resume on behalf of the State all land
affected by the scheme, at any time during the progress
of the scheme, and for ten years thereafter, at not more
than present value plus 10 per cent.
5. This great national work to be utilized in connexion with
the immigration scheme by providing opportunities for em-
ployment for immigrants.
Committee’s report.—Yes.
6. Preference of employment to be given first to Australian
soldiers.
Committee’s report. —Yes.
7. Commonwealth and States concerned to pass necessary
legislation for increased expenditure and for otherwise giving
effect to the above scheme without delay.
Committee’s report.—Yes.
The report was adopted.
UNIFORM RAILWAY GAUGE.
The PRESIDENT.—I have to present to the Con-
ference the report of the Committee with regard to the
proposals of the Prime Minister respecting a uniform
railway gauge. The report is as follows;
That the Conference ask the Prime Minister what pro-
portionate amount the Commonwealth would be prepared to
contribute towards making a uniform gauge (a) on the main
lines between the Capitals, and (b) for general conversion;
and that the Conference further consider the matter on
receipt of the information.
The report was adopted.
AVIATION.
Mr. BARWELL.—When this matter was previously
under consideration, Mr. Scaddan moved—
That it is desirable that each of the Parliaments of the
States should refer to the Parliament of the Commonwealth
pursuant to Section 57 (xxxvii.) of the Commonwealth of
Australia Constitution Act, the matter of the control of
aviation, but so as to restrict —
(а) the control by the State of air-craft owned or used
by the Government of the State so far as the same
is operated within the State; or
(б) the police powers of the State.
The Committee appointed to deal with the matter sug-
gests that we should substitute for that the following
motions : —
That it is desirable that each of the Parliaments of the
States should refer to the Parliament of the Commonwealth
pursuant to Section 51 (xxxvii.) of the Commonwealth of
Australia Constitution Act, the matter of the control of
aviation, but so as*to retain to each State—■
(a) the right to own and/or use for the purposes of the
Government of the State aircraft operating within
the State; and
(b) the police powers of the State.
That it is desirable that (pending the passing of legis-
lation by the Parliament of the Commonwealth pursuant to
such reference) the States should each enact legislation
similar to the Imperial Act 9, George V., Chapter 3, so as
to secure uniform legislation and regulations.
That means handing over to the Commonwealth all
powers with regard to aviation, except that there shall
he retained by each State the right to own, and use for
State purposes within its territory, aircraft. The
States would also retain the police powers. It was
thought by the Committee that it was desirable to add
also that, pending legislation by the Commonwealth
Parliament, the States should each enact legislation
similar to the Imperial Act. Uniformity is desired
not only in.legislation as regards the Act, but as re-
gards regulations made under the Act. I propose that
the report of the Committee on aviation he adopted.
Mr. SCADDAN’S motion was withdrawn.
Mr. BARWELL.—I now move —
That the report of the Committee on Aviation be adopted.
Mr. STOREY. —Generally, I agree with the sub-
stitution of the Committee’s report for Mr. Scaddan’s
motion, but we must take the matter seriously, and be
careful as to just what powers we give the Common-
wealth in regard to it. lam satisfied to allow the
Commonwealth to control aviation. Ido not know
how far the Commonwealth Government are satisfied
to control it.
The PRESIDENT.—They want to do so.


Mr. (STOREY.—They did not show tremendous
anxiety in the matter as far as New South Wales was
concerned. We established a place at Richmond, but
we were not able to get the Commonwealth Government
to regard the matter seriously. It is only lately that
Mr. Hughes has become so enthusiastic about Federal
control of aviation. During the war we trained boys
at the school in New South Wales at very great expense
to the State. After being educated there it was ad-
mitted that they were highly qualified, but the Federal
Government would not accept them unless they received
further education at Point Cook or somewhere else in
the salubrious atmosphere of Victoria. We felt very
keenly the position. Quite frankly, I admit that it is
the function of the Commonwealth to control aviation-
I disagree with any one who says that the States should
do any policing in this matter. If the Commonwealth
have the control of the air they should have it abso-
lutely. There will not be so much traffic in the air
for a number of years as is likely to create confusion.
I am sure Mr. Fihelly is not likely to go into the air
and get in the way of other people. My view and
that of the Minister of Education who controls the
aviation School in New South Wales is that we should
be permitted to go on teaching in our technical college
everything in connexion with the construction of aero-
planes, and give whatever education is possible in regard
to the manipulation and driving of aircraft. The
general control of traffic in the air should be left en-
tirely in the hands of the Federal Government, but the
States should not allow their powers in regard to edu-
cation at technical colleges to be taken from them.
The PRESIDENT.—This resolution would not in-
terfere with that.
Mr. STOREY.—In presenting an abstract resolution
to the Commonwealth Government we must be careful,
because they may subsequently state that such and such
a thing was intended, and they may step in and pro-
ceed accordingly. We know the great restrictions
which were imposed during the war in connexion with
wireless telegraphy. A lad was not allowed to even
experiment in his own back yard, although open
messages were sent from New South Wales to the
Pacific Islands which could have been read by the
enemy. The States should retain the right to give
any instruction that is necessary with regard to the
construction and use of air machines. It may be that
later on aircraft will be used for commercial purposes.
Mr. Hughes suggested that they may be employed in
the postal service, and I quite agree that something
might be done with advantage in connexion with that
service. Judging by what sometimes takes place in
connexion with the telephone and postal services, any
new idea would mean an advance on what obtains at
present.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—I have in my hand a book
lent me by Mr. Collins on “ Aircraft in Peace and the
Law.” It contains an appendix giving the results
arrived at by the Convention relating to international
air navigation which was held in Europe in 1919.
Here are the subjects which are dealt witt, and I think
members of the Conference will see that the majority
of them, if not all, are matters which should be under-
taken by the central government —marking of aircraft,
certificates of air worthiness, log-books, rules as to
lights and signals, rules of the air, minimum qualifica-
tions necessary for obtaining certificates as pilots and
navigators, international maps and ground markings,
collection and dissemination of meteorological infor-
mation, and Customs. These are all matters which
should be dealt with by the central government. There
should be no diversity in the rules of the air, or as to
lights and signals, the qualifications of pilots and
navigators, the marking of aircraft, and so forth.
It would not be at all convenient or conducive to
safety to have the States legislating in different direc-
tions in these matters. Aircraft will be passing from
State to State much more frequently than any other
kind of locomotion. Police powers are necessary to
prevent trick flying, flying over race-courses, or sports
grounds, or places where people congregate, and such
powers can only be exercised by those who control the
police force. At present the States control the police
force, though I do not know if the Commonwealth still
has policemen in Queensland. In any event, Ido not
think the Commonwealth police would be effective in
controlling aircraft throughout Australia. The Im-
perial Act, to which I have referred, gives power for
the making of regulations. Each State could adopt
the same set of regulations, and if this were done
pending action by the Commonwealth we should have
something to go on with.
The PRESIDENT.—I think we might well make
a small alteration in the report which would help Mr.
Storey. If we substitute for the word “ air,” the
words “ air navigation,” it would meet Mr. Storey’s
objection, and effectuate what we really desire.
Mr. STOREY.—I move—
That the word “ aviation ” be omitted, with a view of sub-
stituting the words “ air navigation.”
The amendment was agreed to, and the motion, as
amended, was adopted.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Is it not necessary to have a
motion that the Executive officer of this Conference be
empowered to prepare a Bill to provide for uniform
action pending the adoption of other measures by the
Federal Government?
The PRESIDENT.—It will be necessary, and, per-
haps, Mr. Scaddan will frame a motion.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I move—
That the Premier of New South Wales, as Executive officer,
be requested to draft and submit to the State Govern-
ments—
(a) a Bill to provide for the reference to the Parlia-
ment of the Commonwealth of the necessary powers
in accordance with the terms of paragraph 1 of the
foregoing resolution; and
(b) a Bill_ to provide for uniform action by the States
pending the passage of the Commonwealth legis-
lation.
The motion was agreed to.
CUSTOMS DUTIES ON GOODS IMPORTED BY
STATE GOVERNMENTS.
The debate on this subject, adjourned from 22nd
May, was resumed.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS. —We have considered the
suggestions made during the debate in regard to the
motion on this subject, and we have made alterations
in accordance with the Public Contracts Act of Vic-
toria. The changes which have been made will, I
think, meet the objections to the motion. I now
move —■
That the Conference, having taken into consideration the
proposals outlined by Mr. Massy Greene, as reported in the
Argus of 25th March, 1919, regarding the rebate of the duty
payable on machinery imported for the establishment of new
industries and the development of those now existing, sub-
mits for the favorable consideration of the Federal Govern-
ment that the procedure proposed to be followed before such
rebate can be'obtained should be simplified, and that it should
be sufficient in the ease of goods, machinery, and materials
imported by the State Governments Tor the importing Go-
vernment to satisfy the Minister of Customs that the gocds,
machinery, and material (as the case may be) proposed to
be imported cannot be manufactured or produced in the
Commonwealth, or can only be manufactured or produced at
an unreasonable price, or within an unreasonable time, or in
insufficient quantities, or of a quality unsuitable for the pur-
poses for which they are intended to be applied.
Mr. SCADDAN seconded the motion.


Mr. HARWELL.—-I did not agree with the original
motion, because it would limit importations by State
Governments. The alterations which have been made
meet the objection that I raised.
The motion was agreed to.
PER CAPITA PAYMENTS.
Mr. HARWELL. —I move—
That this Conference directs the attention of the Prime
Minister to the undertaking given after the last Conference
of State Premiers with him that no alteration of the per
capita payments to the States would be made pending the
result of the Convention for the revision of the Common-
wealth Constitution.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I second the motion.
The motion was agreed to.
CONSULTATION WITH PRIME MHSriSTER.
At 2.35 p.m. the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), the
Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), the Minis-
ter for Defence (Senator Pearce), the Minister for
Repatriation (Senator Millen), and the Minister for
Works and Railways (Mr. Groom) attended the
Conference.
The PRESIDENT.—'Now that the Prime Minister,
accompanied by his colleagues, whom we are glad to
welcome to the Conference, is present, I propose to
present to him the resolutions which have been regis-
tered in regard to the matters mentioned by him on
Saturday last. With regard to the resolution respect-
ing per capita payments, I do not say that the under-
taking is definitely registered in the minutes of the
Premiers’ Conference, but some of us saw Mr. Watt
after the Conference had concluded, and subsequently
at Prahran the Prime Minister made this Statement-
Some opposition had also been expressed to the proposals
because they made no provision regarding the per capita pay-
ment by the Commonwealth to the States. He wished to say
that, until the Convention decided the matter, the per capita
payments would continue as they were. That was the posi-
tion. It was perfectly clear.
With regard to the immigration proposals, we have
not yet considered them. The resolutions which I am
submitting are as many as we could turn out in the
time at our disposal.
The Conference then went into Committee on the
subjects which the Prime Minister desired to discuss
witb the Conference.
Mr. _ HUGHES.—There are three matters in regard
to which I said I would submit concrete proposals.
These are immigration, the Murray waters, and uni-
form railway gauge. I propose to direct my attention
to them in that order. When we have exhausted these
subjects, we can proceed to deal with other matters
in regard to which you have already reached conclu-
sions. I understand you have not yet dealt with immi-
gration ; but, if you will permit me, I will refer to it
first, because I prefer to deal with the matters in the
order I have mentioned. I am going to assume that
we are all agreed that it is desirable that this country
shall operate all the means at our command to fill up
our waste spaces and secure a stream of immigrants
of the right kind for this country. It goes without,
saying that the 5,000,000 people in Australia find
themselves heavily handicapped with such a load of
debt as now rests upon their shoulders. Every new
arrival, provided he be a person of reasonable capa-
city, becomes a producer and a taxpayer, and the more
producers and taxpayers, the less the rate per capita
taxation will be, and the larger the field from which
that taxation can be obtained. While that was true
at any time during the last quarter of a century, or
at any time during the history of Australia, it is-addi-
tionally true now, when, as the result of the recent
war, 60,000 men have been killed and 40,000 incapaci-
tated for all practical purposes and unable to take
their places in the industrial army. I have asked the
Commonwealth Statistician to supply me with a state-
ment as to the effect of the loss of those 100,000 men
in terms of money. Taking the loss of men killed and
permanently incapacitated at 100,000, each of whom
at present would be worth at least £2OO a year, the
total loss to Australia is £20,000,000 per annum. That
is the direct loss that Australia has suffered in terms
of money by the death and incapacity of our soldiers.
I say nothing, otf course, of the burden of taxation
which must necessarily be imposed upon us owing to
the heavy debt Australia has incurred as the result
of the war. Immigration has been coquetted with as
long as I can remember. It can hardly be said that
during the last few years the question has been success-
fully grappled with; but the present circumstances lend
themselves peculiarly to an effort on our part in that
direction. There is no doubt whatever that one result
of the war has been to create in the minds of large
numbers of our kinsmen overseas a desire to settle in
pastures new. Probably millions of people whose lives
before the war were “ cribbed, cabined, and confined ”
within the walls of factories, learnt during the war
what it was to live out of doors. Quite apart alto-
gether from the monetary consideration, they have no
desire to return to their former state of living. I am
satisfied, from my own personal observation, that a
rich harvest of immigrants of the right kind is to be
reaped in Great Britain alone. Just let me show what
this means—and I want to contrast the position of
Canada and Australia to indicate the result of an
effective immigration policy. In 1914 there were
3,974,150 persons in Australia; in Canada the popu-
lation was 5,825,000. At the beginning of 1914, before
hostilities were commenced, the population of Aus-
tralia was 4,940,952, while that of Canada was
8.075.000. While we had in that interval increased
our population by about 1,000,000, the population of
Canada had been increased by 2,225,000. During the
period from 1914 to 1917, the population of Australia
had fallen from 4,940,000 to 4,935,000. On the other
hand, that of Canada had increased from 8,075,000 to
8.361.000. We lost nearly 6,000 persons; Canada
gained 286,000.
Mr. LANG.—Was that the result of immigration
from overseas or of a natural increase of population?
Mr. HUGHES.—I am dealing with the population.
Mr. EIHELLY.—But there is no comparison.
Mr. HUGHES. We lost, and they gained.
Australia’s increase from the 31st December, 1906, to
the 31st December, 1913, was at the rate of 2.5251
per cent, per annum. If this rate continued up to
the 31st December, 1919, it would give a population of
5,658,700, or 411,000 more than the population actu-
ally recorded. This is due to war conditions; and, to
make them good, it will be necessary to have a large
amount of immigration. Continuing the rate from
1906 to 1913, would give 6,572,200 on the 31st Decem-
ber, 1925, and 12,261,300 on the 31st December, 1950.
Erom the 31st December, 1914, to the 31st December,
1919, the rate of increase has been 1.290 per cent, per
annum, on the average, which is only about one-half
of the rate from 1906 to 1913, and is, of course, wholly
due to the natural increase—that is, to the excess of
births over deaths. This rate would give a population
of only 5,639,300 at the end of 1925, or, roughly,
1.000. less than we should have on the 1906-13 rate.
The census of 1915 showed that the population’s wealth
was about £355 per head; so that we would be short
by about £325,000,000. I have always been amongst


the foremost of those who realize that ill-directed im-
migration may work great harm to this country. I
do not know of any country where the circumstances
are so unfavorable to development, as far as the dis-
tribution of population is concerned, as Australia. We
have a great continent; but the bulk of the population
is in the five or six great capital cities, which is not a
desirable thing. If we are going to get immigrants
out who will add to the congested population of the
cities, I will not say that they will he of no value, hut
the value will he very doubtful. There is not one
man here who would say that there is not ample room
for millions of people on the lands of Australia. Of
course, all the States are not similarly situated.
Queensland and Western Australia have millions ,of
acres of fertile land awaiting settlement. Victoria is
in a different position. New South Wales stands, per-
haps, midway between the two, and South Australia
is somewhat in the same position as New South Wales
relatively to its population. I am convinced that a
very large number of British ex-service men can he
induced to come to Australia. I am satisfied that
5,000,000 of people can neither defend nor develop
Australia; that they cannot pay its taxation, nor pro-
duce enough money to carry on the great public works
that are necessary for development. I am satisfied
that past methods of immigration have failed, to a
large extent, because of the lack of uniformity in the
systems adopted. I have suggested a definite scheme,
and I have put the proposals in a clear and concrete
form—
Commonwealth to have full control overseas.
Agents-General of the several States to form consulta-
tive Committee in London.
Commonwealth to be responsible for, and have control of,
all overseas organizations and transport arrangements
for bringing immigrants to Australia.
Primary 'object of scheme to be the settlement of immi-
grants on the lands of Australia.
You all know the points. I believe in them, and have
always believed in them. I am satisfied that it is
necessary to have one authority overseas. I am satis-
fied that that is necessary, and that we should he in
dose touch with the States. When in England I tried
to_ arrange with the Agents-General to sit with the
High Commissioner, and to form an unofficial Com-
mittee on this basis. They were unable to agree to
that without the authority of their States. Shipping,
of course, is the very lifeblood of this business, and
the difficulties of shipping are so obvious as to require
no emphasis on my part. This scheme would not de-
serve our attention if it were not contemplated to bring
a great stream of immigrants here. In order that they
shall be brought here, there must be sufficient shipping
accommodation. It will cost money to organize the
matter. When I speak of Britain, I do not confine
myself entirely to Britain, but I say that, in the main,
it the place we must look to for the bulk of our
immigrants, and the ex-service men are the men who,
in my opinion, are, prima facie, the right type of men.
I do not deny that there are others, hut it will be the
business of this organization to see that the right type
of men are selected.
Mr. STOREY.—Are not the British Government
selecting men?
Mr. HUGHES.—I do not know what the proposal
of the British Government is, hut I think it is only
for assistance to individuals. I want to put forward
and secure your approval of a scheme which will, by
co-operation with the British Government, amplify
this scheme and perhaps enlarge its scope. The pro-
posal of the British Government is limited, to twelve
months. To launch a scheme, to get the shipping and
the immigration -movement going, would not be of
much value if the scheme were to he discontinued in
about twelve months’ time. Now I come to the
second paragraph of this proposal. I have
said that preference should he given to British
ex-service men, and that the Commonwealth should
seek the co-operation of the British Government.
Every assistance we can get from the British Govern-
ment, financial and otherwise, will be most material.
Although you are here on behalf of your several States,
and my colleagues are here on behalf of the Common-
wealth, after all, the money has to come out of the
pockets of the citizens of Australia. Whether it cornea
through the channels of the States or of the Common-
wealth is not material. The Commonwealth is to
assume financial responsibility for overseas transport
to Australia. We take full responsibility for that, and
we pay for it; and I have stated, in the last paragraph
of the outline of the suggested scheme of immigration—
States to enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth,
setting out in definite terms what they bind themselves to do
in regard to providing—
(a) Land;
(h) Other forms of assistance, such as depots, sustenance,
general care of immigrants, employment on public
works, particularly on unification of railways gauge
and Murray waters scheme, &c.;
for (1) ex-servicemen; (2) other classes of immigrants.
Now, dealing with this paragraph and the matters
covered by it in due order, it is obvious that to bring
immigrants to this country, and then to leave them at
a loose end, is no good. I remember, many years ago,
when there was a very steady stream of immigrants
pouring into Queensland, while, at the same time,
there were few or none coming into New South Wales.
Mr. FIHELLY.—We have at present 1,700 waiting
in England who cannot get berths.
Mr. HUGHES.—I am referring to a time long before
most of that 1,700 were born. The immigrants came
into Queensland and went over the border into New
South Wales. They did so because, when they got into
Queensland, they were at a loose end. There was no
means of employment. Ido not know how many hun-
dreds of thousands, probably millions, of immigrants
who went to Canada crossed over the border into the
United States of America; and it was one of those
puzzling features in the immigration policy of Canada
for a long while that, despite the tremendous flow of
immigrants, the population did not increase correspond-
ingly. As a Commonwealth, we know no State boun-
daries. It makes no difference whatever to us whether
immigrants settle in Queensland or Tasmania, in West-
ern Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, or
Victoria. We want to get the people into Australia.
What does matter is that the immigrants shall '/«.
taken up by an organization; that they shall he given
opportunities of getting employment; that they shall
have an opportunity to settle on our fertile land's;
that they shall, in short, be put in the way of becoming
wealth-producers, and not merely wealth-consumers; not
swelling the congested populations of the cities, hut
adding to the opportunities of the cities by
producing wealth from the country. I do not
think I am, on behalf of the Commonwealth, ask-
ing too much in this matter, which is vital to them.
I could not help noticing that you, gentlemen, when
I was speaking on Saturday about various things, kept
bringing me back to the question of the per capita pay-
ment. It is with you as King Charles’ head was to
Mr. Dick; and it is, indeed, for most of us. Ultimately
we want to know, What about the money? It comes
to this- —you must have more taxpayers; you must have
more wealth. To have more wealth, you must have
more people. It is only right, therefore, that you
should say, before we engage in this heavy financial
and other responsibility of formulating and giving
effect to the policy of immigration, what you as States


are prepared to do. We cannot make promises to people
in England of plenty of work, bring people out here,
and leave them. Many of you now sitting round this
table have had a similar experience to that I myself had
when I came here. I do not want any one to have the
same experience as I have had. There is no need for
it, because we could place 1,000,000 people of the right
kind in the right place, and that would be a blessing to
the whole of Australia. But if 1,000,000 people came
here and were just thrown into the cities, to the dis-
organization of our labour market, it is quite certain
that our last state would be worse than our first. In
the end, no doubt, they would sort themselves out, but
only after a great deal of trouble. I want you to say
what you are prepared to do. What lands are you pre-
pared to give ? I want you to state this, not in general
terms, but in definite and precise terms. I think it is of
vital importance—and I have linked these proposals up
with immigration—that we should undertake great
public works of such dimensions as to themselves absorb
many thousands of men. When these works are in
themselves not only desirable, but vital to the welfare of
Australia, and when these works can be expedited, and
by their construction add to the wealth of Australia, and
at the same time attract large bodies of desirable immi-
grants from overseas, we see the advantage of adopting
these proposals. I do not think I need say much more.
This is one of those proposals regarding which we are
all agreed in the main. I remember stating —I think it
was in 1913, when my distinguished colleague was head
of the Commonwealth—the views of the Labour party
on immigration. I said then that we had never been
opposed to immigration as such, but that we had been
opposed, and were opposed, and would continue to be
opposed, to bringing out people to a disorganized labour-
market in the great cities. That position, I take it, is
substantially correct. I would not be in favour of any
scheme which would have the effect of so disorganizing
the labour market now. It is because I believe firmly
that the foundation of this country’s present
and future greatness rests upon the settlement
of our lands that I urge that we must, at
all hazards, offer such inducements and create
such facilities as will attract people to our lands.
You have the land, but we have none, or next to none.
We have, it is true, the Horthern Territory, and, on
behalf of the Commonwealth, I can only say that they
can have there any facilities they like.
Mr. FIHELLY.—That does not get over your re-
sponsibility for settling the Horthern Territory.
Mr. HUGHES. —I wish I could see the relevance of
the remark, but I cannot.
Mr. LAHG. —What Mr. Fihelly means is this; You
have the land in the Horthern Territory, and you have
the people over the water. Can you not bring them
both together?
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho; we cannot. In this matter,
without co-operation, it is absolutely futile for either
party to try to go on. We must have co-operation.
The Conference asked me on Saturday for a concrete
proposal, and here is a concrete proposal. We are
prepared to foot our share of the bill. How you will
say, “Where are we going to get the money from?”
Well, gentlemen, where do you get the money from?
I have not at my fingers’ ends the amount of money
that you have got from us in the last few years, nor
am I prophet who will say how much you will get
from us during the next few years.
Mr. STOREY.- —You have a shrewd idea, though.
Mr. HUGHES.—What I want to say is this: Ulti-
mately the taxpayer of Australia must face it. Out
of his pocket the interest comes. I have put the
scheme before you. We have set out in plain terms
what we are prepared to do. We ask you to set out
what you are prepared to do. Some of you may say,
“We have no. lands.” That is probably true of the
State of Victoria, where there is very little Crown
land; but in the State of Western Australia and the
State of Queensland they have great areas of magnifi-
cent lands, and they want population badly. They
want those lands settled. To a lesser extent the same
thing is true of the State of New South Wales and
other States. I ask you, gentlemen, to address your-
selves to this proposal, and to say what you propose
to do. Time is the essence -of the contract. It will
take months to arrange for shipping, and it is useless
to go on with propaganda for immigrants in England
unless you have shipping for them.
Mr. STOREY.—And employment here.
Mr. HUGHES.—And employment at this end. I
shall speak later on of the employment we can provide
by the two schemes which are covered by my other
proposal—the Murray waters scheme and the unifica-
tion of the railway gauge. But any other employ-
ment that you have, well and good. You have lands,
and you have done something for the soldiers. What
are you prepared to do for British ex-service men by
placing lands at their disposal? What assistance, if
any, are you able to give them to go on those lands?
What assistance, if any—perhaps I ought not to sug-
gest this—do you want from us in regard to that
matter? I say that to you, because it will save you
the trouble of saying it yourselves. These are the
questions I want answered. I will not take up your
time any longer.
After discussion,
Mr. HUGHES continued. —In connexion with the
carrying out of the Murray waters scheme, there is
room for the employment of from 10,000 to 20,000
men. That fact is, of course, of the utmost possible
importance. I say to Mr. Storey, on behalf of the
Commonwealth, that under this immigration scheme
not one man shall go to Hew South Wales without the
consent of Hew South Wales.
Mr. LAHG.—If men come to Australia you cannot
stop them coming to Hew South Wales.
Mr. HUGHES. —That is the most crushing refuta-
tion that I could imagine of that gospel of pessimism
that Mr. Storey treated us to a little while ago. People
do not go from where they are well off to where they
will be ill off. They do not go from a good country
to a bad country, where they will starve.
Mr. LAHG. —Ho one suggests that Hew South
Wales is a bad country; but it surely has its limita-
tions —at the present time anyhow.
Mr. HUGHES. —I do not deny it. Of course,
it is a good country—a very good country—but you
know that one of the great problems that con-
front statesmen all the world over is how to prevent
the influx into the cities. Unless we can check it some-
how, civilization itself must be destroyed. We must
be prepared to pay the price of offering inducements
to people to settle in the country. It may be a heavy
price, but in the long run it will be cheap. Sydney,
of course, lives on what the rest of Hew South Wales
produces—no one denies that—and Sydney’s present
and future greatness depends on the hinterland of Hew
South Wales being developed. I hope you will agree
to this proposal, and that you will do so without any
reservations in the way of delay. The first addendum
by the President I agree to. That is to say, we will
appoint a man in the Commonwealth Government who
will, in effect, act as Minister for Immigration. He
will be at the disposal of the State Ministers who are
concerned in this matter, whether the Premiers of
States or such other Ministers as are appointed.
From time to time there will be periodical


meetings and there will be frequent communications as
to the kind, of men you want, and the number of men
you want. As to whether we shall assist the States by
way of loans, in view of the two proposals that we
have put before you, and that we have yet to con-
sider—l refer to the Murray waters scheme and the
unification of the railway gauge—-in connexion with
which we have committed ourselves to the expenditure
of many millions
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—About £25,000,000.
Mr. HUGHES.—I am not going to say how much.
Mr. FIHELLY. —The unification part of that will
take 25 years to deal with.
Mr. HUGHES.—America dealt with that matter
in one year.
Mr. FIHELLY.—We shall not.
Mr. HUGHES.—I do not see why we should not.
But, of course, we shall not if we do as has been done
at many other Premiers’ Conferences. Lt has been the
practice to agree in the most pious and amazing way
to overything_ that has been suggested, and then to go
away and do nothing.
Mr. STOREY.—If you guarantee to assist Hew
South Wales to obtain money, you will not he able
to find as much as we are able to spend in the way of
development.
Mr. HUGHES.—I can quite believe that. Ido not
think you can claim any credit for it, because, if I were
to ask Mr. Fihelly, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Barwell, or Sir
Walter Lee, they would say the same thing. We believe
in the policy I have put forward. We say it is the
foundation of our present and future welfare. We
urge it on you. We ask you to adopt it, and get on
with it. If you get on with it, believe me, we shall
have a result speedily; and that is what you want.
Every day that passes, you not only lose the present
opportunity of getting a man, hut you probably lose
altogether the chance of getting him, because some other
Dominion will get him—not only some other State, but
some other Dominion. I urge you, therefore, to adopt
the scheme, and to take such steps immediately as will
give effect to it. We are ready. Mr. Watt, in London,
is now waiting to proceed; and, if you are ready, we
are ready—not next year, or next month, but now—
to take immediate steps to go on with the scheme. It
will take months before we can organize shipping.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Is your Government intending io
make representations to the British Government that
will interfere with the negotiations that are in progress
between the Queensland Government and the British
Government ?
Mr. HUGHES.—Xo. I know nothing of those
negotiations; and I should be extremely surprised to
learn that the British Government were prepared to
advance you any money; but if they are, I see no
reason why their graciousness should stop short at
Queensland. You can be quite sure that, if they lend
you anything, I shall make their life fairly uncom-
fortable until they lend us something too.
Mr. FIHELLY.—There you are. You are going
to “ butt in.”
Mr. HUGHES —I am not going to “ butt in ” at
all; but lam going to have my whack. If you say
that you want 4,000 or 5,000 people to go out to Queens-
land, I say, “ Get them; that is all to the good, and we
will try under this scheme to provide shipping for
them.” If we could get them all to Queensland, as far
as the Commonwealth is concerned, that would he all
right.
Senator MILLEK.—The more the British Govern-
ment helps Queensland, or any other State, the less
need for that State to seek help from the Common-
wealth.
Mr. FIHELLY.—And the more reason why you
should not “ butt in.”
Mr. HUGHES.—We have not “ butted in ” in any
way. Perhaps it would be premature to talk of this
scheme of yours until you see what view the British
Government takes of it. It is of no use our being
like children flattening their noses on the window of a
sweetstuff shop, and saying, “If I get that, I will not
give you any.” It is no use talking like that until we
get something. If you see anything in the window
that I have not noticed, well, when you get it, we can
deal with the matter. The British Government, I
know, finds itself in extremely straitened financial cir-
cumstances, and it is much easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than it is to get money
out of the British Government to-day. However, Mr.
Theodore may be able to get it.
Mr. FIHELLY. —The proposal emanated from them.
Mr. HUGHES.—Then nothing more need be said.
I ask you to agree to this scheme without delay. I have
given you the assurances for which you asked—that
the States will determine the number of men, and the
kind of men; that the States will have their consultative
committee in England; and that there will be the ful-
lest consultation between their representatives and the
Commonwealth representative On this side. As to
land settlement, I have set down here what we all
believe in. The basis of the scheme is land settlement.
At the same time, the great public works that I have
spoken of—the Murray waters scheme and the uniform
railway gauge scheme—and developmental railways, of
which Mr. Mitchell has spoken, are vital factors, and
cannot be pushed to one side when we are considering
this proposal.
The PRESIDENT. —The Prime Minister has indi-
cated to me that he is prepared to add to the proposi-
tion these two conditions, which 1 have suggested:—
(1) The Commonwealth and States are to co-operate
and consult from time to time as to the number of
immigrants that can be absorbed in the respective
States, and the class of immigrants required. That in-
sures cooperation at both ends. (2) The Common-
wealth undertakes to assist the States hy way of loan
for approved land settlement and public works. We
say that if we absorb 1,000 immigrants w© must b© able
to proceed with such-and-such public works. Land
settlement will cost so much. The Commonwealth, as
far as it is able financially to assist Us, will help the
States in that respect.
Mr. HUGHES.—I must not be held to commit the
Commonwealth to that proposal, if it is to be Con-
sidered as part of the scheme, so that the scheme is
itself contingent upon it. All that I Say is this; That
the scheme itself is limited clearly in the most definite
way, and is under your control, because you are to say
how many men you can absorb, and what kind of men.
Having agreed to that proposal, with that first adden-
dum, if you ask, “Are you prepared to consider the
question of advancing loans for the purpose of this
scheme on public works approved by you?” I say,
“We are prepared to consider it; but We do not say
with regard to public works other than the Murray
River and the unification of railway gauge that we will
provide the money.” In regard to the unification of
gauge, we do say that we will provide the money. As
far as developmental railways are concerned, I may
remark that I shall look very favorably on them, be-
cause I do not think we can spend our money in any
better way.
The PRESIDENT.—I think the word “ approved ”
saves the situation, as far as the Commonwealth is con-
cerned.
Mr. HUGHES. —Approved by the Commonwealth.


The PRESIDENT.—I think there is a concrete
proposition in this; and it does seem to me that, if we
are in earnest in the endeavour to promote a sound
immigration policy, it is a considerable step forward
in providing the machinery to effectuate it. I am pre-
pared to take a motion as to whether we are prepared
to recommend to our respective Governments that
scheme, with additions which I have outlined.
Mr. MITCHELL.—I move—
That the Conference adopt the proposal of Mr. Hughes, with
the additions proposed by the President.
Mr. BARWELL seconded the motion.
Mr. COYNE. —There is but one thing for which
we can thank the Commonwealth. The Common-
wealth is responsible for immigration, and the only
thing it is contributing is that the High Commissioner,
on notification from the Agents-General for the States
that they require a certain number of men within a
certain time, will ring up the shipping offices and say
that space is required for that number.
The PRESIDENT. —• The Commonwealth has
agreed to pay all the expense of the overseas organiza-
tion, and all the expense up to the time the immigrant
lands in Australia, and, further, undertakes to con-
sider applications for loans to promote settlement.
Mr. COYNE. The Commonwealth Government
have only agreed to two things. They have not agreed
to pay the fares.
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes, they have. If the British
Government does so, it is nothing to do with you. If
the British Government does not, we will.
Mr. COYNE.—But you will use your best endea-
vours to get the British Government to do it?
Mr. HUGHES.—No doubt.
Mr. COYNE. The Commonwealth is asking the
States to provide employment and make lands avail-
able; and lands cannot be made available without
developmental work in the way of roads, &c., yet the
Prime Minister has not given any guarantee that the
Commonwealth, as the chief borrower, will advance
the money.
Mr. HUGHES.—If we are prepared to advance all
the money for everything you want, where do you come
in at all? What are you doing in the matter?
Mr. COYNE. —I do not wish it to appear in print
that the Prime Minister is giving the money. He is
doing nothing of the sort. He is just advancing the
money to the States, which will have to pay it back
again. Ido not want it published that the money for
developmental work from the Commonwealth is a gift.
Mr. FIHELLY. —I should like to explain my atti-
tude to the Conference. I am prepared to have the
proposal submitted to Cabinet, but I do not think there
is much business in it. Everything hinges on the
financial arrangement. The proposal of Mr. Hughes
is to set up a central administration in London, with
the High Commissioner as chairman, and the Agents-
General as members. I am quite in accord with that,
and lam sure my Cabinet would he. The Prime
Minister will get passage money for the immigrants
from the British Government.
Mr. HUGHES.—Not necessarily.
Mr. ElHELLY.:—Judging by every communication
which we have had from them, they are quite willing
to pay the passage money.
Mr. GANN. —Until the end of 1921.
Senator MILLEN.—The British Government’s, inti-
mation was that it was not an immigration policy,
but an offer to aid in the settlement of returned men.
Mr. EIHELLY.—Once we have the men here, we
must have money to enable us to settle them; and
unless the Commonwealth Government find the means
for financing the States, the proposals are lacking in
something essential. I am quite sure we can get immi-
grants, and immigrants of a good type; and I think
it would he a good thing for Australia to have them,
while I also believe that we can absorb our unem-
ployed. But the most essential factor is the financial
arrangement, and in that connexion we ’have the nebu-
lous statement from the Prime Minister that he will
consider the position according to his resources.
Mr. SC ADD AIN". —But he cannot close the markets
of the world against us.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I know that. ;
Mr. HUGHES.—-You want to limit the expense.
Mr. EIHELLY.—You do that.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—You cannot govern our
purse.
Mr. EIHELLY.—We do not want to do that. You
may set up a scheme outside of Australia, and get the
passages of the men paid by the British Government.
The States will have to settle the people in some way
or another, and to do that we must provide for attrac-
tive public works. The Commonwealth will, no doubt,
assist by building the Federal Capital and by railway
works. I understand that it is proposing to give
£1,225,000 for the work on the Murray.
Mr. HUGHES.—Wo are giving £1,000,000 now,
and will spend two or three millions if we expedite
the carrying out of the scheme.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I am quite willing to submit this
proposal to the Queensland Government, hut it will he
rather nebulous unless we have something more defi-
nite in regard to the financial aspect of the matter.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. —Will you make some pro-
position? All this is destructive criticism.
Mr. EIHELLY. —It is not that. I am merely
analyzing the position and telling you where I am.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—What do you want?
Mr. FIHELLY. —I am glad of the query. I want
a guarantee of sufficient money for the carrying out
of the developmental work that will be necessary to
settle men who come to Queensland through the Com-
monwealth agency. We can carry out work on the
Burnett Upper, which will provide permanent occupa-
tion, and we have seasonable occupations, such as cane-
cutting and shearing.
Mr. SCADDAN.—You want the Prime Minister to
become “ Uncle Mo.”
Mr. EIHELLY.—I do not care whether he lives
in London or in Australia, so long as I know his
address.
Sir WALTER LEE.—-I am not able to say defi-
nitely, on behalf of my Government, whether I can
accept this proposal. Like Mr. Fihelly, I want the
opportunity to give it some consideration. I under-
stand, from an interjection made by the Prime Min-
ister, that, while the Commonwealth would be pre-
pared to undertake the organization of immigration,
they would not expect the States to accept any more
men than they could provide for. In other words, the
limitation of the Commonwealth organization would
be the number of men each State would be prepared
to take. I think each State would be in the same
position as Tasmania. At the present time, we can
get all the men we can possibly absorb, if we can
get money to secure land for returned soldiers —and
Senator Millen knows we are looking to the Common-
wealth Government for assistance in this respect —we
can settle a large number of persons, but we must have
a guarantee of the necessary money. If we are going
to absorb men in the carrying out of public works,
again we must have a guarantee for the money which
will be required. It looks simply as if we propose to
set up another organization to do that which the States’
Agents-General can do at the present time. If we
can get the money to resume land and carry out public


works, the Agents-General can get all the men we re-
quire.
Mr. HUGHES.—By how much has the population
of Tasmania increased during the last ten years?
Sir WALTER LEE.—About 8,000 a year.
Mr. MITCHELL.-—-They have done their best.
Sir WALTER LEE.—We are doing better every
year, and we say that we can do better still with the
present means at our command without' adding to the
cost by duplicating machinery. I must submit this
matter to my Cabinet for further consideration before
I can commit it to this scheme.
The PRESIDENT. —We might pass a motion ex-
pressing our approval of the Prime Minister’s pro-
posals, and undertaking to submit them to our
Cabinets for their approval. That is not suggested
with a view to the indefinite postponement of the
matter, but with a view to definite action.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Is not that rather a contra-
dictory proposal? We approve of the scheme with a
qualification that we must submit it to our Govern-
ments.
Mr. SC ADD AN. —We do that with everything we
adopt here. We cannot commit our Cabinets.
Mr. COYNE.—The best we can do is to say that
we will submit the proposals to the respective Cabinets.
Mr. SCADDAN.—That is what we propose.
Mr. HUGHES.—You must, of course, decide this
matter for yourselves; but, if that is all you propose to
do, I hope you will not do anything. This is a matter
of great importance to the people of Australia, but
in the exercise of your discretion you may do what you
please. I think it will come as a shook to the people
of this country if they find that you are not prepared
to agree to submit these proposals to your Cabinets.
Mr. SCADDAN.—We arei going to do that.
Air. HUGHES. —That will put the responsibility
upon the Cabinets. The proposal is one which Aus-
tralia obviously requires to be acted upon, and I can
conceive of no reason why its consideration "should be
postponed or objected to. I said in Bendigo that if
you rejected this we would go on ourselves. We have
full control over immigration and the public purse,
and when it comes to the pinch you will find that we
can get on without you. We will co-operate with the
States that co-operate with us, but not with those who
will not co-operate with us.
Mr. SCADDAN. We will co-operatc with the
scheme.
Mr. STOREY.—Although we have taken up a defi-
nite position on behalf of our State, we have not said
that we would not submit the scheme to our Cabinet.
We wanted the Conference to understand what it has
cost New South Wales to put the people on the land.
Mr. Mitchell asked me whether I was attempting to
commit, Australia by my figures. Nothing of the sort.
During the last five or six years we have borrowed
£9,000,000 for the purpose of settling people on the
land. Though we may get the money hack, that does
not alter the fact that we are committed to that extent.
If we attempt to borrow another £9,000,000, what will
the “ calamity-mongers ” say ? I have to remember
the obligations that are upon us; but I undertake to
say that, if the Prime Alinister will provide money for
railways through good country in increasing amounts,
we shall guarantee to go ahead. It is useless to talk
about settlement preceding railway construction through
large areas of good country.
Mr. HUGHES.—-We are prepared to commit our-
selves to our obligation to raise the whole, of the money
for the unification of the gauge, and that means many
millions. It will employ many thousands of men. It
will not affect Tasmania; but we will build a bridge
for them.
Sir WALTER LEE.—You have my unqualified sup-
port.
Mr. STOREY.—If the Prime Minister will find us
an amount of money equivalent to our quota of the
cost of the unification, we will take it; but it will he
to put people on the land. To bring to this country
a large number of men for employment on the unifica-
tion would be a calamity.
Air. COYNE.—The Prime Minister says that he
wants this to be done immediately. If the resolution
is carried, it will not mean any greater expedition than
if my motion were adopted.
Sir WALTER LEE.—If I vote “No” for the
motion, does it not imply that I refuse to submit it to
my Cabinet?
The PRESIDENT.—I think you should vote
“ Yes.”
Mr. JONES. —We should know whether we shall be
allowed to submit the matter to our Cabinet even if
we vote against the motion. It seems to me that some
States are pitting themselves against others rather than
taking a broad Australian view. It is useless to talk
about settling a large number of men in Queensland
without railway construction. I agree with the Prime
Minister that it would be a good thing to employ immi-
grants on railway construction to fit them for land
settlement; but simultaneously with immigration we
must have railway construction.
Mr. HUGHES.—Ten thousand men can be employed
on the unification of the gauge.
Mr. STOREY. —I disagree largely with what has
been done, but I will submit the matter to my Cabinet.
The PRESIDENT.—We will take two motions.
Eirst—•
That this Conference approves of the outline of suggested
scheme as recommended.
The motion was agreed to, as was the following
motion: —
That this Conference undertakes to submit the scheme, and
recommend it for consideration hy the States Cabinets.
MURRAY WATERS.
Consideration of the Murray Waters scheme (ad-
journed from earlier in the sitting) was resumed.
Mr. HUGHES. —We are now to consider the ques-
tion of expediting the work on the Murray River. As
I said in my general remarks on Saturday, this is a
great national work of the utmost importance to land
settlement and the development of Australia generally.
I submitted a definite proposal, which members of the
Conference have had before them. I pointed out that,
while it was originally contemplated that the expendi-
ture would be £4,366,000, the Commonwealth would
provide £1,000,000, and the three States the balance
in equal proportions. It was anticipated that twelve
.years would elapse before the scheme was completed.
I pointed out that there had been great delay in the
carrying on of the work, and that at the present rate of
progress it was not likely it would be completed in any-
thing like twelve years. I also referred to the fact
that the cost would greatly exceed the original esti-
mate, in consequence of the increase in the rate of
wages and-the cost of materials. I told the Conference
it was vital that the rate of progress should be expe-
dited, and that authority should be obtained from the
Commonwealth and the State Legislatures to authorize
the expenditure of additional money to meet the higher
rate of wages and the increased cost of material, and
also to meet the increased expenditure consequent upon
advancing the progress of the work. I submitted a
scheme covering all these points, and on behalf of the
Commonwealth Government I undertook to ask the
Federal Parliament for approval to increase its liability
from £1,000,000, which is, roughly speaking, one-tenth


of the estimated cost, to one-fourth of the whole ex-
penditure. I estimated the total cost would be some-
thing between £8,000,000 and £12,000,000, and possibly
more. _ I suggested that the scope and powers of the
Commission should be greatly widened. It is futile
to expect the rate of progress to be increased unless the
powers of the Commission are widened. At the present
time there is a conflict of authority. Many matters
have to be referred to different authorities, and the
result is what might be expected. I suggested that, in
order to conserve public interests, and prevent the
benefit of the expenditure of public money going largely
into the pockets of land-owners, the Commission
should have the right to resume land at its present value
plus a certain percentage, the amount of which I left
for this Conference to decide. The Commission was
to have power to resume land at any time during the
progress of the works, and for a certain period there-
after. I also left it to this Conference to decide the
period. I suggested that this work is to be looked at,
not only on its merits as a great national undertaking,
but as one of the utmost possible importance. I say
deliberately that the possibilities of the Murray are
not less than those of the Nile. I see no reason what-
ever why, in the valley of the Murray, there should
not ultimately be as great a population as there is
in the valley of the Nile. This work, in addition to
providing employment for our own soldiers, would also
be the means of securing work for immigrants, who
would have an opportunity of being acclimatized, and
of getting first-hand knowledge of the land of Australia.
The Conference has considered these proposals. With
regard to the proposal that the work should be greatly
expedited, and that the Commonwealth should increase
its liability to one-fourth of the total cost, the Confer-
ence is in its approval. No suspicion has
been raised as to the hona fides of the proposal. As
to the suggestion to increase the powers of the Commis-
sion, so that the work might he completed as early as
possible, the Conference decided that further informa-
tion is to be obtained, and that the States will then bo
prepared to consider the proposal. I hope the Con-
ference will not stand on that decision, which, in effect,
means to mark time. No body can be more competent
to _ decide this question than this Conference, and if
this Conference is going to refer it to some other body,
I see no reason why that other body should not again
refer it to some other body, and so on, ad infinitum.
This Conference can say whether, as a matter of fact,
the powers of the Commission ought to be widened!
I ask you to say whether there is any other way In
which the work can he expedited. Can you cite me
one instance of any great work being successfully carried
out where there has been a conflict of authority? You
cannot. If this Commission that we have is unsatis-
factory, replace it by another. If the members of it
are not competent, put others iu their place. But we
should intrust the work to a Commission. Parliaments
cannot carry it out. I ask, with all respect, “ What do
we know of this work as an engineering undertaking? ”
What we should do is obvious. We ought to select suit-
able persons, and place this work in their hands, so
that they may carry it out successfully, just as would
be done if the work was being carried out for private
enterprise. It is in that way we can get the work done,
and get it done quickly. When you ask for further
information, I do not know what kind of information
you want; but I ask you to consider the pro-
position as I have put it—that there is no possi-
bility of getting this work well and quickly
done except by giving wider authority to the
body in whose hands you have intrusted it.
So I ask you to widen the powers of the Commission.
There is Ministerial and governmental control, which
is set out in the various Acts of Parliament. Beyond
that control you should not go. You have control that
is most effective. If the Commission is spending
money unwisely, or is incompetent, you can put other
men in their places. As to point Ho. 4 —the power of
resumption of present values, plus a reasonable per-
centage—you have agreed to that in principle. It
would have been well for Australia if we had adopted
this principle in regard to all public works. We are
staggering under a tremendous burden aS the result
of the expenditure of literally hundreds of millions of
public money, and a comparatively few people have
reaped a very rich harvest from that expenditure.
Such a thing should not be perpetuated. When we are
going to spend this public money, let us see that the
betterment goes to those who spend the money. The
Commonwealth adopted that principle in regard to the
Federal Capital, and it does not matter how long these
lands are occupied, the value remains the same as on
the day when the Act was passed. You agreed to the
principle, hut you say—
At any time during the progress of the scheme, and for
ten years thereafter, at not more than present value, plus
10 per cent.
I agree to that. When you say that the States should
have the power of resumption, and that the whole of
the betterment should go to the States, I take great
exception. The resumption ought to be by the Commis-
sion, and the betterment ought to go towards paying
off the cost of the work. If it should go in propor-
tion to contributions to the scheme, that would he satis-
factory; but the resumption should be by the Commis-
sion, and the increase of value—the value that the land
will have when the money has been expended—should
go towards wiping off the cost of the work. Ho. 5
This great national work to be utilized in connexion with
the immigration scheme by providing opportunities for em-
ployment for immigrants,
you have agreed to. You have also agreed to Ho. 6
Preference of employment to he given first to Australian
soldiers.
You have agreed to Ho. 7
Commonwealth and States concerned to pass necessary legis-
lation for increased expenditure and for otherwise giving
effect to the above scheme without delay.
There are only two points, both of which are matters
of detail, that you want more information about before
you agree that the powers of the Commission should
be widened. I do not ask you to agree as to what the
powers should be. I only say that they should be
widened. If you agree to that, whoever are the Minis-
ters in charge of these things should meet and decide
on what powers they will recommend, and the respec-
tive Governments and Parliaments can approve of them.
In regard to resumption, I submit that the point I
have raised is a good one. I contend that the Com-
mission should have the power to resume, and that the
betterment should go towards wiping out the cost of
the work. If there is anything over after that is paid,
it should go to the States. The Commonwealth has
no right to it; it has no right to anything more than
its fair share of the quota. Do not under-estimate what
this betterment will he. In all probability, in fifteen
years from now, the value of this land from the expen-
diture of the money and the consequent settlement
will be more than sufficient to pay off the cost of the
whole scheme. The scheme will be self-supporting,
quite apart from the wealth that will come to the
States from the increased settlement.
Mr. STOREY.—Do you anticipate that the land re-
sumed will remain the property of the Commission in
perpetuity ?
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho.
Mr. GROOM.—At present the Commission has
nothing to do with the acquisition of land.


Mr. HUGHES.—The ownership of the land remains
with the States, and I say that the betterment, until
the scheme is paid for, should be applied to paying
off the cost of the scheme. If each State contributes
equally, the betterment will he distributed equally.
If we pay one-fourth, the three States will pay three-
fourths. The land, as land, will belong to the States.
When the scheme has cleared up the betterment, that
betterment will belong to the State within whose con-
fines the lands are. The Commonwealth has nothing
whatever to do with that.
Mr. HARWELL.—There is just one point in regard
to the third paragraph, that is, as to the Commission
having full power to press on with the work. The
difficulty is that Hew South Wales, on its Murray
River works, pays a minimum wage of 11s. 3d., whilst
Victoria pays 11s. 9d., and South Australia pays 11s.
If you have one authority controlling the whole thing,
and fixing the wages, the difficulty will he to come
down below the Hew South Wales rate of 14s. 3d.
If 14s. 3d. is made the ruling rate, it will affect our
industries in South Australia. It will put upon us
a burden we cannot bear. We are not in the same
position as Hew South Wales. We simply cannot
afford to pay it. We have been getting the work done
for 11s. a day. Hew South Wales has paid 14s. 3d.,
and that caused a certain amount of discontent. Here
we have a difficulty which is apparent at once. It is
one of the difficulties that caused us to ask for a further
explanation on this particular point. I take it that a
Commission possessing full power could fix wages right
through. But it would he a very difficult thing for a
Commission to fix a wage and get the work done unless
the highest rate of wage were obtained, and that is
14s. 3d.
Mr. HUGHES.—I see that difficulty. I think that,
sooner or later, the pressure for uniformity of pay-
ment will become irresistible. I know nothing of the
circumstances under which Hew South Wales has paid
the 14s. 3d. *
Mr. HARWELL.—It is a Board of Trade decision.
Mr. HUGHES.—Very well. They pay 14s. 3d.
Exactly the same position is being created in the Com-
monwealth Public Service, and we have to face that.
The Commission would be, at least, as well able to re-
sist an increase of wage as is a State. I am speaking
of a Commission with full powers.
Mr. BAR WELL.—I am looking at the effect all
over the State. In South Australia, our wages are
lower all round than in Hew South Wales.
Mr. HUGHES.—I realize that point. But take this
view: In Hew South Wales, for example, the Rail-
ways Commissioner has certain powers. He has power
over wages, subject to the Statute and the decision of
a certain tribunal; and I am hound to say that the
Commissioner can resist many demands that the Go-
vernment could not resist. It is easier for a Commis-
sioner to do a thing in that line than it is for a Go-
vernment to do it. Hobody is more vulnerable than
the Government in matters of that kind. But, per-
sonally, if I wore in a business I would try for
uniformity of conditions and uniformity of rates.
Mr. HARWELL. —Can you come down below the
highest ruling rate at the present time?
Mr. HUGHES. —-I admit it is very difficult. I
quite appreciate the point. But I do say —and this
has relation to wages generally—that yon cannot get
more out of a quart pot than it will hold. Wages in
this country cannot be higher than the amount of
wealth produced, after allowing for replacement of
capital and for wear and tear. I have my eye chiefly
on the expediting of this work and the unification of
control. Get competent men, and give the matter over
9618.—6
to them. You have the power of the purse. If they
abuse their authority, you can shut off the supply of
money. As it is now, we have strikes in two places in
Victoria, and one in South Australia. That is un-
desirable. After all, this is a scheme that depends
upon uniformity. The full benefits wyll not be de-
rived from the scheme unless it is carried out in its
entirety.
Mr. LAHG.—The working man always wants the
highest wage.
Mr. HUGHES.—I have had a long experience of
working men, and I have always done my best to help
them get to the top. It is human nature to want the
highest wage, whether a man is on the roads, or in
the Legislature, or wherever he is. I have done as
much to level up wages for working men as any man.
I have worked with these men. I have seen one of my
oldest friends, a faithful servant of the people, work-
ing as night watchman on a wharf after twenty years’
service for the State, and I stand by him. I hope
that the Conference will see its way clear to approve of
my proposal. Let us get on with it, and I promise, on
behalf of the Commonwealth Government, that we will
immediately introduce the necessary legislation and
do everything in our power to get the Commonwealth
Legislature to agree to it. I believe that it is so
thoroughly seised of the importance of the work that
no difficulty will be experienced in putting the amend-
ing legislation through the House of Representatives
and the Senate.
Mr. RITCHIE. —As far as South Australia is con-
cerned, and as far as my knowledge goes, the Commis-
sion have had practically entire control. Ido not re-
, member a single instance in which a recommendation
made by the present Commission has not been adopted
by the South Australian Government. With regard to
paragraph 3, do I understand the Prime Minister to
state that the whole of the lands that will be benefited
by the lock system are to be resumed by the Commis-
sion ? i
Mr. HUGHES. —Ho. The Commission are to have
the right of resuming. They will resume as trustees
for the particular States. The betterment would go
to the States and the Commonwealth in the proportion
in which they contributed. It is not so much a ques-
tion of resumption; it is the power to resume. That
would insure that settlement would not be blocked by
high prices being charged for land.
Mr. RITCHIE.—That has cleared up that point.
How, with regard to the wage question, referred to by
the Premier of South Australia. At the present time
we have works on the Mitta Mitta Reservoir. Then
you have your next work, the Torumbarry Weir.
The Mitta Mitta works are being constructed by two
authorities at the present time—by the New South
Wales authority on the Hew South Wales side of the
river, and by the Victorian authority on the Victorian
side. We come next to the Torumbarry weir, which
is being constructed by the Victorian authority. Then
we come to the Lake Victoria works, which, although
in Hew South Wales, are being constructed under the
South Australian construction authority. The greater
part of the work under South Australian control is
being constructed by contract. There was only a very
small part of the work —making some of the embank-
ments and clearing the Frenchman’s Creek, from
which the water enters Lake Victoria—that was not.
That work is getting towards completion. The men
struck there the other day. There is not very much
of it to do, and we are hopeful that the contractors
who have the other two contracts will take over that
part of the work and complete it. Then we come down
to the Blanchetown works, which are in South Aus-
tralia. They are also being constructed by South


Australia. In connexion with the Mitt a Mitta works,
the Torumbarry weir, in Victoria, and the Lake Vic-
toria works, which are under South Australia, there
is a strike to-day. The Hew South Wales works are
the only works going on, and the men there are getting
14s. 3d. per day.
Mr. HUGHE'S. —Han you give me a rough idea of
how many men there would be employed on all the
works in the three States, supposing there were no
strike ?
Mr. RITCHIE. —I am not able to give that infor-
mation at present, but I think we have on the Blanche-
town works something like 150 men. I am not able
to say how many men there are at Lake Victoria, be-
cause that work is under contract. Perhaps the Hew
South Wales and Victorian authorities can state the
number of men they are employing. Our position is
this; The men at Blanchetown, up to within a fort-
night ago, were working at the recognised South Aus-
tralian rate of wage of 10s. per day, with Is. per day
sustenance allowance. That is equivalent to 11s.. per
day. But we give conditions to our men that are not
given in Hew South Wales at all, and if those privi-
leges were taken into consideration, the rate would
come very nearly up to 14s. per day. I have just been
informed that there are approximately 1,000 men em-
ployed on all the works along the river. For the men
at Blanchetown, whom I have just mentioned, we find
camp equipment, we supply food at cost price, and we
give other privileges which bring their pay pretty well
up to the vicinity of 14s. per day. But now we hear
that the men who are working in Hew South Wales
are moving for the privileges that the South Austra-
lian receive, in addition to the 14s. 3d. per day. As
the Premier has rightly said, if we were to come up
to the 14s. 3d. rate in South Australia, it would not
merely apply to the Blanchetown works and the works
we are doing in conjunction with the other two States,
but the_ same demand would be made all over South
Australia, and we cannot stand up against that. I
had the honour of representing the State of South Aus-
tralia at the Mitta Mitta works, and on returning I
was questioned about the matter, and I said, “ Our
works are going on all right, and why should we be
interfered with?” Representations were made that
we should pay 14s. 3d. per day; and I pointed out that
if we did so, we should have to pay that rate through-
out South Australia, and we could not possibly meet
it. With regard to the resumption of land, I presume
that the Commission, when appointed, will not consider
any land below the Blanchetown lock, because we have
170 miles of river in South Australia which are not
affected by the locks. They are below the first lock.
Mr. HUGHES. —Ho Crown lands will be affected
at all.
Mr. RITCHIE.—The great bulk of the land I am
speaking of is private land, and it will not be benefited
to the extent that the other land will be.
Mr. HUGHES.—If there is no betterment, it will
not be affected by the scheme.
Mr. GROOM.—The proposal is distinctly limited to
lands affected by the scheme.
Mr. RITCHIE.—Might it not be brought in that
those lands are affected by the scheme? If we had a
dry period, such as we had in 1914, the Commission
might say, “ These lands have benefited to this extent—
by conserving water in the upper reaches, we are able
to let water pass down to you in greater volume than
would have been the case had not the locks been con-
structed.” South Australia has great interests in this
part in connexion with soldier and other settlements.
In fact, I think our most valuable settlements are on
the lower parts of the river that are not affected at all.
I merely mention this matter in order that subse-
quently the Commission may not be able to say, “ South
Australia thought she had rights there, and slept on
those rights. She should have made a protest at the
time.” I want to make that point perfectly clear now.
Mr. MACKIHHOH.—I should like to say a word
or two about this matter. This is not such an easy
problem as it looks, and it divides itself into two
heads. Eirst of all, there is the question of one autho-
rity, which is practically to bring about an agreement
as to the wages. It seems to me that, if it had not
been for the wages difference, this trouble would not
have arisen at all. I am informed that the Commis-
sion has been -working pretty well. Its staff has been
drawn from the three States concerned, and, as far
as one can understand, it is working well. Is it the
idea that a new body altogether, with a new staff and
everything of that sort, should be created? That would
be sheer waste of public money. You have the ability
and the experience in the men handling the matter
at the present time. Then it practically comes down
to this—that there is no fault to be found with the
present position except in regard to the discrepancy in
wages. I am not going to say any more about that.
Mr. Hughes has talked about the Hile. The Yarra
is a fine stream, but it is nothing like the Mississippi,
and the Murray is nothing like the Hilo. The differ-
ence in volume is enormous. The Murray may be the.
Hile of Australia, but it is not the Hile. We can
only get certain quantities of water out of the Murray.
Victoria has its share, Hew iSouth Wales its share,
and South Australia its share. Victoria is practically
well up to the mark of the water that she will ever
be able to take out of the river. We shall only be
able to resume lands that are held by small people,
and I do not know whether our Parliament will con-
sider a proposal to give any authority the power of
compulsory resumption against those people. But on
the other side of the river you have miles and miles
of country in the Riverina*. There will be Bun-
gowannah weir, if it is ever made, and there is the
possibility of a take-off somewhere in the vicinity of
Tuppal. The water could be drawn from Tuppal right
through the Riverina.
Mr. RITCHIE.—Water could be conserved in the
Edwards River.
Mr. MACKIHHOH. You cannot increase the
general volume of the river, and you cannot increase
the amount How South Wales is entitled to use.
The question wants a great deal of consideration.
It is proposed that land should be resumed, and that
the enhanced value, or betterment as Mr. Hughes calls
it, should go into a pool. It means that there will be
a large enhancement of a big area in Hew South
V ales, where they have the water and the cheap land.
The difference between the laud on one side of the river
and the other strikes every one who looks into the
matter.
Mr. HLGHES.—CouId that not be adjusted by wip-
ing the liability off in proportion to the land of the
State whose land was affected by the betterment?
Mr. MACKIHHOH.—That may be, but as far as
soldiers are concerned they are the people -who ought
to got the betterment.
Mr. GROOM.—How can the soldier or any other
settler get the benefit unless you resume?
Mr. MACKIHHOH.—There is no doubt that Hew
South Wales and Victoria should co-operate in the de-
velopment of the Riverina and other areas of fertile
land further up, what is known as the Upper Murray,
but I do not think it would be fair for Hew South
Wales to take the enormous betterment. The report
I had last year from two experts was that on the price


on which, large areas in the Kiverina could he resumed
from a line running northward from Moama westward
to Moulamein, the enhanced value from the railway
alone would he at least £1,000,000, and from the water,
of course, it would be very much larger. The en-
hancement from the railway and the water, put together,
would go a long way towards paying for this scheme.
Mr. HUGHES.—Supposing, in the State of Hew
South Wales, you resume 20,000 acres, and the better-
ment on that amounted, for the sake of argument, to
£1,000,000, then under this proposal the idea would be
that Hew South Wales would take three-fourths and
the Commonwealth should take one-fourth, because it
would contribute one-fourth. When the whole thing
was wiped out, the additional betterment as well as the
ownership, would be vested in the State of Hew South
Wales.
Mr. MACKIHHOH.—That is a matter for Hew
South Wales to consider. My own idea is that it
would be better for Hew South Wales and Victoria to
co-operate. I say this because I think that Hew South
Wales should look into the situation. It seems to me
that the benefit from the district which will carry an
enormous population should go to the State in which
the people are situated. This proposal may make
the two States consider what I regard as one of the
most important points to Victoria. There is an enor-
mous area of land in the Kiverina worth £2, £2 10s.,
and £3 10s. an acre, whereas on the Victorian side land
would be worth £l2, £l5, and £2O. The Prime Min-
ister may induce Hew South Wales to accept this pro-
posal, but I do not think it is desirable, with irrigation
work carried on so admirably by the States concerned,
to introduce another authority. However, the result
of his proposal may be to bring Hew South Wales and
Victoria together, and cause them to agree to have the
land resumed in the way he proposes, in a manner that
is commendable to Hew South Wales. The Common-
wealth Government is putting up £1,000,000. Mr.
P. McM. Glynn, who was in the whole of this business
from the start, saw that it would not be carried through
unless the Commonwealth mothered the scheme. The
Commonwealth has mothered the and is con-
tributing to the extent of £1,000,000, and it is well
worth while for the Commonwealth to do so, because
it means the bringing of population and wealth to Aus-
tralia. . How it is proposed that the Commonwealth
shoald come in and get the enhanced value of the laud
which is commanded on the Hew South Wales side of
the river. I think this proposal wants a little think-
ing out, but I welcome it as something which may
bring about a co-operative movement.
Senator MILLEH. —You speak of creating a new
authority. The Commonwealth does not suggest that.
It may he the present authority with enlarged powers.
Mr. MACKIHHOH. —The Commission has settled
powers. Mr. Hughes has pointed ou; that the power of
the purse remains with the State. Except for that, the
Commission has pretty wide powers now.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. We are only employing
1,000 men, and we want 3,000 or 4,000.
Mr. MACKIHHOH. Victoria has recently pro-
vided for 1,000 settlers in one small area, and it is es-
sential that the water should be made available. There-
fore, I think it would he a good idea to hurry up with
the scheme; and if we could come to some arrangement
by which this authority, with greatly increased powers,
should get on with the work and surmount the wages
difficulty, it would be a good thing.
Mr. GROOM.—Having presided over the Commis-
sion for some time, I should like to make a few obser-
vations. Mr. Mackinnon is wrong when he says that
the wages question alone has brought this matter to a
head. The main work of the Commission has been
carried on while I have been President, and I want to
pay my tribute to the merits, ability, and sincerity of
the three representatives of the States associated with
mo in that work. As to the agreement, I want the
Conference to realize that it was an agreement which
was formed for the express purpose of carrying out
certain specified works on the Murray River. The
Commission was formed to construct those works and
see that Australia got the benefit of tbe river which has
been flowing to waste. The Commission was constituted,
and started work. The first serious defect I found is
this: The agreement is really a contract between three
States and the Commonwealth, and the States have been
constituted as constructing authorities. Before the
Commonwealth can proceed with any work, or works
not specified in the agreement, it must submit the esti-
, mates and plan of the work to he undertaken to the
State authority. The Commission cannot go faster
than any State will allow it. When work is submitted
by the States concerned, all we" can do is to criticise
and suggest, and eventually we must give the work our
imprimatur before it is proceeded with, and then it
goes back to the States to be carried out. We have no
power to compel work to he expedited.
Mr. RITCHIE.—Do you know of any recommenda-
tion which has been objected to?
Mr. GROOM. —The Commission does not make
recommendations. The States outline the work, and
we authorize it to be done. I may say that the States
and the Commonwealth have been working up to the
present in complete harmony. lam Chairman of the
Commission, but lam not an engineer. There are
three engineers representing the States and one repre-
senting the Commonwealth. They go through every
proposal very carefully, and we are thoroughly satisfied
with the fitness of the engineers. The States are fully
represented, and the Commonwealth has only one vote
in the deliberations of the Commission. Surely a body
constituted as the Commission is ought to be intrusted
with the task of getting surveys and other operations
carried out. The survey to Wentworth has not jet
been carried out. We have authorized the construction
of weirs and locks in South Australia, hut although
tenders have been invited, quite two months have
elapsed without anything being done.
Mr. RITCHIE.—We cannot commence work of that
kind without some delay.
Mr. GROOM.—What I am pointing out is that this
work, so far as the States are concerned, has to he
dealt with along with other public works of the State.
It would be better to have in each State a body of men
specially set apart to survey the river and carry' out
other work.
Mr. RITCHIE.—That has been done in South Aus-
tralia.
Mr. GROOM. —Hot as I think it should be done.
The work on the Murray has to take its turn with
other public works of the State. There is no engineer
whose sole duty it is to carry out the works in con-
nexion with the scheme. That applies to all the States.
I am not making these remarks in any spirit of adverse
criticism, but by way of suggestion. I, as a Queens-
lander, can look at these matters without any State in-
fluence, and regard the scheme as a national undertak-
ing. If a dispute takes place, and South Australia
objects to what Victoria, Hew South Wales, and the
Commonwealth think ought to be done, the Commission
cannot go on with the work. The matter has to be
referred to an arbitrator, and if an arbitrator cannot
be agreed upon, then the matter has to he referred to
the Chief Justice of Tasmania.
Mr. RITCHIE. —That kind of dispute has never
arisen, and is never likely to.
Mr. GROOM. —That is the machinery to deal with
an emergency if it does arise. I only want to mention
one other matter, which experience has shown us has


generated difficulties. I refer to the wages trouble.
The wages trouble has been responsible for holding up
these works since practically the beginning of the year,
and a stoppage of works in connexion with an indus-
trial trouble on the River Murray is a very important
matter indeed. A stoppage taking place, as was the
case at Torumharry at the end of December, and con-
tinuing to the winter months, means practically that,
when rains come during the winter months, work has to
be held over for some considerable period. We are de-
pendent to a large extent on climatic conditions, and
I do think that the Central Commission should be em-
powered to arrange its own industrial conditions in
connexion with these works in the Valley. The only
alternative is the setting up, by agreement, of an In-
dustrial Board to have control of industrial conditions.
One or other alternative is essential. Otherwise, these
stoppages are going to become chronic. I say that a
big national work like this ought not to he dependent
upon_ varying local conditions. A body ought to he
constituted in such a way that it can grapple with its
own problems and deal with any trouble in its own
way. A fear was expressed this afternoon that South
Australia might be adversely affected by a different wage
standard being .set up from that now prevailing in that
State. My answer is that we have to face a similar
difficulty throughout the Commonwealth to-day. Cer-
tain Federal standards prevail throughout Australia.
There has been a certain amount of contrast between
Federal and State awards. But we have had to face
that, and go on. I do not think that any particular
award in connexion with this matter is likely to upset
industrial conditions, either in Victoria or in South
Australia. Anyhow, we must try to get a solution. We
have to face the question of how we are to get over
any difficulty _ arising in connexion with conditions.
X believe it will he found that what the Premier of
South Australia says is true, but I would ask you to
bear in mind that, in carrying out a big industrial
scheme like the one under consideration, it is better
that uniform conditions should prevail. The wages
standard is not always a good standard as to what is
best for men in certain areas. If the men desire to
have certain conditions, if they prefer to have pay
instead of comfortable conditions provided by the
State, it is their concern. It might he' better to have
something like the Victorian conditions, including
baths and other comforts. The points that have been
raised seem to me to point to the necessity of revising
the agreement, and of constituting a single authority,
with a view to driving on the scheme to a definite con-
clusion. Otherwise, I am afraid it will drag on for
years, and we shall see valuable water going to waste.
Mr. LAMG. —If we give the extra power to the
Commission, will they have the right to fix the rates
of wages independently of the States ? If they do not,
where does the uniformity come in?
Mr. GROOM.-—I think they ought to he constituted
the same as public Commissions are usually constituted,
and they will be guided as far as they can by the
standard that prevails.
Mr. HUGHES.—Whether they would or not, they
would not he outside Federal jurisdiction, because there
would be clearly an Inter-State dispute within the mean-
ing of the Act, and, therefore, any men who felt
aggrieved could come to the Federal Court.
Mr. LAMG.—You told us previously that your Court
was so congested that it could not deal with matters.
Mr. GROOM.—The problem we have to face is to
provide uniformity of conditions, so as to prevent a
stoppage of work, and so that the men will he treated
justly and equitably. With the constitution of the Com-
mission as an employer, you would have one body deal-
ing with all the men.
Mr. HUGHES.—There is another way out of it.
Would you agree, Mr. Lang, to the appointment of a
special tribunal clothed with South Australian, Vic-
torian, and Mew South Wales jurisdiction? You could
say that their decision would he final.
Mr. CAMM.—The difficulty in connexion with the
labour conditions was, I think, all brought about by the
Mew South Wales Board of Trade’s declaration that a
living wage was £3 17s. per week. Then Judges in
the industrial Courts decided that, if the labourers had
their wages raised, there should be a marginal increase
to skilled workmen. It seems to me that the only way
out of this trouble is for representatives of the three
States affected and a representative of the Common-
wealth to confer with representatives of the Australian
Workers Union, because that is the only union that is
really involved in this dispute. The only thing to do
is to have a conference with the representative? of
the Australian Workers Union, and to try to come to
some arrangement to make the wages uniform. In Vic-
toria the men have certain privileges that the Mew
South Wales men have not, and lower wages than the
Mew South Wales men; but there is really little dif-
ference between the Victorian wage plus the privileges
and the Mew South Wales wage as fixed by the Court.
There is certainly a difference between the Mew South
Wales wage and the South Australian wage. A con-
ference between the Commisison, or representatives of
the three States, and representatives of the Australian
Workers Union seems to me to be the only way out of
the difficulty. An arrangement may be come to whereby
all the work can go on simultaneously and quickly.
Time is the essence of the contract. The best thing
is to get these people round a table, and point out the
urgency of the Murray River work being gone on with.
At present a pitiable state of affairs exists. In two
of the States the men are on strike. The men in my
own State are all right. You can hardly expect the
men on the Mew South Wales side to consent to a reduc-
tion of wages. The only way is to have a conference,
to see if a uniform rate cannot he fixed for the men
right along the Murray. I understand that the Vic-
torian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission are
afraid that it might spread from the Murray to other
workers whom they employ in Victoria, and that the
South Australian authority is afraid that it may spread
right throughout that State. As to that phase of the
matter, I do not want to say anything, because I do not
know just how they feel with regard to that, hut it seems
to me that the suggestion I have made is the only
feasible way out of the difficulty. Ido not think it
would be impossible to come to some arrangement as
to uniformity, which would enable the work to be gone
on with expeditiously, and not only 1,000 men, but
another 4,000 men, to he employed, which, I under-
stand, is what the Prime Minister wishes. It would
be a tragedy if we could not solve the problem.
Mr. BARWELL.—There are two questions I should
like to put with regard to the power of resumption.
Is it the idea of the Prime Minister that the Commis-
sion may resume land that has already been settled?
We have certain stretches of land in South Austialia
which have already been settled, some of it iu con-
nexion with soldier settlement. Is it the idea that the
Commission may resume some of that land? The other
question is: Will the Commission Itself undertake the
work of settlement on land that is resumed?
Mr. HUGHES.—Whether the Commission will re-
sume land already settled is, I take it, a matter to he
considered when we determine the functions and the
scope of the Commission. One aspect of the case pre-
sents itself quite prominently. An irrigable- holding
ought not to be larger than is necessary to enable a
settler to get a good living. If a man has 1,000 acres
of irrigable land, he has too much. It will not pay


us to spend £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 if there are
going to he 1,000-acre holdings. At Mildura there are
5-acre, 10-aere, 12-aere, and 20-acre holdings keeping
people, and keeping them well. My answer to the first
question is this: The powers of the Commission could
be expressly delimited in terms. In defining the terms
of the Commission’s powers, we should have regard
to the amount of land settled, if we allow them to touch
such land at all, and where the amount of land held
by any settler is only a living area, then it should not
be open for resumption. It should be outside the scope
of the Commission. Where, however, an area is much
larger than a living area, and many people could be
settled where one is now, we should consider whether
we should give the Commission power of resumption.
Mr. BAR WELL.—My second question was as to whe-
ther the Commission itself would undertake the work
of settlement on land resumed by it.
Mr. HUGHES. —That is a point that has to be
considered, and it is clearly outside the immediate scope
of these resolutions. What we want is to have the
thing determined. I think the proper people to settle
the land arethe States through whose land thewatergoes.
The business of the Commission is to get the job done,
and the business of the States is to settle the people
when the job is done. If my view is to be taken, then
I say we exclude from the Commission the function
of settling people on the land. The function of the
Commission is to get the land ready for settlement,
and the function of the States is to settle the land when
it is ready.
Mr. RITCHIE. —Under the proposed scheme, will
each of the States that are represented to-day have a
representative on the new Commission?
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes, that would be the idea. The
Commonwealth and the three States concerned would
each have a representative. All I want to say in con-
clusion is that this is a great national work. It is
far above party politics, and far above State divisions,
although it happens to lie within the confines of three
States, and affects them most directly. When Mr.
Cann states that, instead of 1,000 men, there should
he 4,000 men employed on the works, all I say is that
there is ample room, provided we can supply sutficient
money for more men, and the more men we have en-
gaged, the quicker the work will he done, and the
sooner settlement will begin and the money come hack.
If we lend £4,000,000 and we do not get a return for
twelve years, we shall he worse off than if we lend
£8,000,000 and get a return in seven or eight years.
Time being the essence of the contract, as Mr. Cann
points out, I strongly urge the Conference to approve
of the suggestions which I have had the honour to
bring forward, and to ask the several Legislatures to
give legal sanction to these recommendations.
The PRESIDENT. —Before any definite result can
accrue from this discussion, there will have to he de-
tailed consideration of detailed concrete propositions
by the Commonwealth and the State Legislatures. The
representatives of Queensland, Western Australia, and
Tasmania have been very patient, and I know that
they want to get matters in which they are more vitally
interested brought on for discussion. It seems to me
that the discussion has shown that, while we accept
the underlying principles of the memorandum presented
by the Prime Minister, we can only arrive at a definite
result by detailed discussion in Committee by repre-
sentatives of the three States and the Commonwealth.
What I would suggest to the Conference is that we
should refer the memorandum and the reply to a Com-
mittee representing the three States and the Common-
wealth, so that a definite Concrete proposition may be
brought up, along with the details, I am quite pre-
pared to urge my own Cabinet to agree to any bold
enterprise of closer settlement along the Murray. In
my opinion, we should be able to devise some means of
effecting a settlement of the wages dispute, but that
could be better discussed in a quiet talk around the
table between the parties interested than in open Con-
ference. With a view to arriving at finality and
getting most satisfactory results, I suggest that, having
affirmed the principle, we should refer the matter to re-
presentatives of the States concerned and the Common-
wealth, and that, if possible, a meeting should be held
before the representatives of New South Wales and
South Australia return to their States.
Mr. HUGHES. —I hope that something a little more
definite will be done. I would suggest that the Con-
ference affirm the principles as set out here; and, as
these are bold outlines of the scheme, and the details
have to be filled in forthwith, that, having approved of
it, we refer it to a Committee consisting of a repre-
sentative of each of the three States and a represen-
tative of the Commonwealth. Let the Committe sit
while the Conference is on, and let us come to a deci-
sion. If that is not done at once, well, the day after
to-morrow the Prince of Wales will he here, and you
know what you arc—we shall get nothing done. My
mind is torn with dissension as to what is the right
kind of thing to wear and how I shall look, and I am
appalled at the prospect. Now I want to get this work
done. Since you all approve of the scheme, refer it to
a Committee such as I have suggested, and I will ap-
point Mr. Groom to act for us, and he will be at your
disposal until to-morrow night.
Mr. STOREY.—This afternoon, the New South
Wales representatives agreed with the scheme, hut
since then I have been listening to Mr. Mackinnon,
and he struck a note which made us feel that possibly
our newness was responsible for our ready acquies-
cence. I do not wish to he put in a false position in
regard to the matter. The question which we were
arguing in Committee seemed to be very important,
but I think it could be easily got over, although it will
not be settled by bringing wages down to the 10s. a
day, which is paid in South Australia, until you can
make foodstuffs cheaper in New South Wales, and that
is the special function which I and my colleagues are
charged with. We do not see how wages could be
brought back to 10s. a day. There is another aspect of
the matter, and that is the Prime Minister’s statement
that whatever surplus moneys accrue from this pro-
position would go to pay off the cost of the scheme.
That is something of an innovation in public works.
There are no States I know of paying off works of
that description.
Mr. SC ADD AN.—How about Western Australia?
Mr. STOREY.—I am talking about States that are
States. I am not allowing Western Australia in-
cidentally to come into the picture. In New South
Wales we are not attempting to pay off, and we shall
not be able to do so. As a matter of fact, the people
of New South Wales are putting up with interest
charges on nearly £4,000,000.
Mr. HUGHES. —We do not ask the settler to pay
it all. We only ask for it to be paid off from the en-
hanced value given to the land held by private persons.
Mr. STOREY.— There are so many large estates
contiguous to these propositions that, if the honorable
gentleman is to make a success of it, it can obviously
only be done by. huge resumptions, which will cost
enormous sums of money. When you subdivide these
estates, you have either to claim the ownership or allow
the would-be settler to purchase right out. If he pur-
chases right out, he will, according to the plan of Mr.
Hughes, have to pay interest and overhead charges,
and sq much by way of capital,


Mr. HUGHES. —I could not have made myself
understood, so let me put the matter right. The settler
is the State’s, and the Commonwealth will not inquire
as to relations between him and the State. I do not
think you were in when I answered a question by Mr.
Harwell. I said the Court -would have nothing to
do with settlement; the States would make arrange-
ments with the settler. They can charge him what they
like. The point I want to make is this; That in order
to prevent the land-owner from getting all the advan-
tages of the outlay, we could give the Commission
power to resume land at the difference between the
value of the land as it is to-day and what it will
be after we have spent this money. The difference
would go towards wiping off the cost of the scheme.
The settler will get all the advantages, because he will
get the land at a low rate, instead of at the rate ho
would have to pay if the land is resumed at the
enhanced value.
Mr. STOREY.—I am afraid I still misunderstand
Mr. Hughes. If the settler has to pay an amount for
his land which will ultimately provide for the cost of
the reservoir and the dams, he has clearly to find the
money.
Mr. HUGHES. —It is not the settler at all.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Suppose these works in-
crease the value of laud from £5 to £2O per acre, it is
out of the £l5 that this scheme will be paid for.
Mr. STOREY.—There are only two sets of people.
Those who occupy the land as settlers, and the States in
conjunction with the Federal Government as owners or
as the persons who find the money; and if the cost of
the reservoirs and the dams is to be paid for, some one
must find the money, -and that some one will be the
settler. There is nobody else.
Mr. HUGHES. —Ho, no. Let us suppose for a
moment that a man holds a block of 500 acres, and
after it is irrigated he is able to get a living off, say, a
tenth of the total area. It follows that we shall be
able to settle ten times as many people on the irrigated
area as on the non-irrigated area. Suppose that a
man holds 500 acres before it is irrigated, and the land
is worth, adopting the figures put forward by Mr. Mac-
kinnon, £3 10s. an acre, is he to be allowed to hold that
area, and take advantage of the closer settler by mak-
ing him pay £3O an acre ? Such a rate would crush the
settler. It is from the difference between these
two prices that we are going to secure the repayment
for the money which is expended on the scheme. If,
on the other hand, a man holds only a living area when
irrigated, we will not resume it.
Mr. STOREY.—I do not wish to make this a
dialogue between us, neither do I wish to weary the
members of this Conference on this subject. But
while this may be regarded as a detail, it is one of the
essential details which will tend to make or mar the
future of this scheme.
Mr. HUGHES. —It is a revolution we are now pro-
posing, but it ought to have been brought about 50
years ago.
Mr. STOREY. —We carried out this scheme of re-
sumption in connexion with the Yanco Estate. We
bought it at the market value, and subdivided it in such
areas as to enable a man to make a living.
Mr. HUGHES. —Did you buy it before it was irri-
gated, or after?
Mr. STOREY.—It was purchased before being irri-
gated. We resumed that land for the purpose for
which it is being used to-day, and the Commonwealth
will have to do that.
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho, the State will have to.
Mr. STOREY.—-The owners of areas of land along
the Murray will say that their properties are worth
from £2 to £5 per acre. If there is a dispute, the
matter will go to arbitration. Suppose the price is
fixed at £3 10s., the purchaser of the land after sub-
division will have to pay such a rate as will enable the
cost of these works to be repaid.
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho.
Mr. STOREY.—Then how is it to be paid? I am
not attempting to take advantage of the fact that Mr.
Hughes may not have given close attention to this
matter. I want to know who is going to pay for this
huge expenditure. If it is not the person I suggest,
then I do not know what is meant by the proposal.
In Hew South Wales the people are carrying the bur-
den, and are quite ready to do so; but when Mr.
Hughes said that we were going to gather in all the
money, and a third party was to provide for the ex-
penditure, I really do not know what is going to
happen. It is not fair that those who go in for the
pioneering work, and who have to put up with the
results of mistakes, should have to pay all these charges.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—If land is worth £2O an
acre to the incoming settler, where is it wrong to charge
him that price?
Mr. STOREY. —This is a huge undertaking, which
will greatly benefit posterity, and it is only fair that
posterity should bear its proportion of the charge. It
is certainly not fair to ask the present settler to under-
take all the cost.
Mr. SOADDAH.—Posterity will own the land.
Mr. STOREY.—Exactly.
Mr. GROOM. —Do you base the rate on the in-
creased value?
Mr. STOREY.—Yes. The man on Yanco pays
rent for the land. It is entirely different from giving
the fee-simple. The settler will have to pay for the
huge weirs, according to Mr. Hughes.
Mr. HUGHES.—How many men owned Yanco
originally ?
Mr. STOREY. —One.
Mr. HUGHES. —How many own it now?
Mr. STOREY.—One hundred.
Mr. HUGHES.—That land is worth more to-day
because you have spent millions on it. You got it for
a certain price, and it is worth probably ten times as
much to-day. You are charging the settlers on the
higher rate. If you had not resumed it, and had put
the water there first, you would have had to pay very
much more for the land.
Mr. STOREY. —The asset to-day is worth millions,
and it is the State’s property.
Mr. HUGHES. —We want to see that the added
value goes back to the people—that is, to the State.
Under this scheme, we are protecting the State and
the future settler, who will not be loaded with a heavy
overhead charge. From my earliest infancy in politics
I have been a believer in land-values taxation. I am
certain that the enhanced value caused by the expendi-
ture of the State should belong to the State. We are
seeking in this scheme to apply that principle. For
some reason or other you are opposed to it.
Mr. STOREY.—I am not. In the one case the
State owns the whole of the land, but in this case we
propose to subdivide the land and sell it.
Mr. HUGHES. —"What we say is that, where the
land is held by private individuals, the Commissioners
should have the right to resume it at the present-day
value. The Commission has nothing to do with sub-
dividing. That is done by the State.
The PRESIDEHT.—Is there any motion to sub-
mit? I suggested that the matter of the extension of
powers and of the further powers that should be con-
ferred on the Commission should be a subject for the
consideration of the Committee of tbe Conference, and
that the three States should meet at once and consider
the proposals with the representative of the Common-
wealth,


Mr. HUGHE'S.—I am prepared to refer the scope
of the Commission to a Committee that is to sit imme-
diately.
Mr. BARWELL.—I understand that the Prime
Minister wants us to agree first of all to his suggested
scheme. He said that it was not the intention of the
Commission to resume land that was already settled.
According to clause 4, power is to be given to the
Commission to resume all land affected by the scheme.
We should refer that matter first of all to the Com-
mittee.
Mr. HUGHES.—You agree to the broad principle?
Mr. BARWELL.—Yes.
Mr. HUGHES.—And you wish to refer the scheme
to the Committee to report to the Conference?
Mr. BARWELL.—Yes.
Mr. BARWELL. —I move—
That the matter be referred to a Sub-committee, consisting
of the Ministers of Lands, for consideration, and report
to-morrow.
Mr. STOREY seconded the motion, which was
agreed to.
Mr. HUGHES. —I now come to the matter of the
uniform gauge. In referring to this matter on Satur-
day, I said that it had formed the subject of discussion
at many previous Conferences, that many Commissions
had inquired into the matter, and that many recom-
mendations had been made, but that nothing had been
done. The Premiers’ Conferences of 1912, 1914, and
1915 considered it. The War Railway Council, in
1911, considered the matter, and recommended a 4-ft.
84-in. gauge between the capital cities. A Committee,
representative of the Commonwealth and each of the
State railway systems, which met in 1912 and 1913,
recommended a 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge. A Conference of
Railways Commissioners had met in 1897 and defi-
nitely recommended in favour of a 4fft. 84-in. gauge.
The matter is of importance from the stand-point of
defence and of development of commerce, and it is
of immediate interest to every citizen of the Common-
wealth. Our present system of railway construction
is involving us year by year in increasing difficulties
and expense. In 1897, it was estimated that the cost
of converting the broad gauge to 4 ft. 84 in. would be
£2,360,500. In 1913, the figure had swollen to
£7,295,000. The estimated cost of conversion of all
lines in the several States to the standard gauge was,
in 1913, £37,000,000. Since then, the cost of every-
thing has increased. Let us look at the matter from
the stand-point of defence. It is hardly necessary to
point out that we are guardians of the continent and
are 5,000,000 of people, and that mobility is the very
life and soul of our Defence Eoroe. It has been esti-
mated—Senator Pearce will correct me if I am wrong
—at a Conference at which the heads of the Defence
Department and the railways of Australia were re-
presented, that it would take three months to convey
50,000 men, with all their equipment, from here to
Brisbane. Of course, that statement was ridiculed
when made, hut, upon examination, it is found to be
borne out. Mr. Hoyle supplied me with some figures
showing that it would take 660 engines to move, I
think, but I am not quite sure, some 20,000 men. The
break of gauge is a very serious impediment to our
national expanse of trade. The effect of the break of
gauge on the drought conditions is too obvious to need
emphasis.
Mr. LAYG.—I would not dwell too much on that.
Mr. HUGHES.—I would not go further than to say
that, if it were possible to run the Victorian trucks
from the districts where the fodder is grown to the
places where sheep are starving, the sheep ought to be
kept alive.
Mr. LAYG. —Every locomotive taken into a dry
area consumes an amount of water. In many instances
the trip would be so lengthy that the locomotive would
have to lay up at the end of it.
Mr. HUGHES. —I do not dispute that statement,
nevertheless I think it is perfectly obvious that the
same amount of water is required by a locomotive,
whether it waters at Albury or elsewhere. There are
1,100 trucks stuck up at the border. (
Mr. LAYG. —The point is that a locomotive will
not carry sufficient water to last it from Albury to the
north-west of Yew South Wales.
Mr. HUGHES. —I will not say any more than this:
The position is intensified tenfold by the break of
gauge. America, like other countries, began, as we did,
with a number of railway gauges. That was the case
in England, too. I have read the story—one of
the most pathetic stories ever penned by the
hand of man—about the number of Conferences on
this question. Earnest men have all come to the
same conclusion, and Conferences have agreed times
out of number, but nothing has been done, and it
is infinitely more costly to do to-day what has to be
done than it was ten years ago. It will grow more
costly every year. I put the suggestion that we should
go on and get on with the job. I does not want any
Commission to inquire into it; it wants a Commission
to do it; and I have suggested that the only Commis-
sion wanted is a Commission to be appointed with suffi-
cient power, and given sufficient money, to get on with
the job. Although I did not agree with him entirely,
Mr. Eihelly said something to-day that was much to
the point. He said that it would take some time to
do this work. Therefore, whatever the work costs, we
have not to spend the money in one year. But America
did a most stupendous thing. There, 13,000 miles of
track were transferred inside twelve months, and the
actual change was made in two days. Mr. Eihelly said
we could not do what America had done. Ido not
know about that. I have my own opinion about
America and Australia.
Mr. EIHELLY.—We have not the population and
the resources,
Mr. HUGHES.—I am not going to say we have; but
I say that they have shown us a mighty good example;
and, though wo may not be able to come up to them, I
do not see that this is a job for a lifetime. At any rate,
the sooner we begin the better. The essence of the
matter, of course, is money; and the suggestion I make
is that the work be put in hand immediately to connect
the States’ capitals from Brisbane to Perth with a
4- 8-J-in. gauge. That involves a new line from Kal-
goorlie to Fremantle, and a new line from Port Augusta
to Adelaide. It involves a line from Kyogle to Bris-
bane.
Mr. EIHELLY. —Kyogle is on a system of its own.
Mr. HUGHES. —What I have said is quite right.
The scheme involves a new line from Kyogle to Bris-
bane. For the rest, it involves the conversion of the
5- 3-in. gauge to a 4-ft. Bj-in gauge. lam not a
railway engineer. The railway engineers hare made
their recommendation. I am suggesting that, there
should be appointed a Commission of three competent
men. of whom the Commonwealth shall appoint one and
the States two. I propose that, to prevent there being
a Commission of six or seven persons; everybody
knows that that would be too many. We will make the
financial arrangements for raising the money by n on-
negotiable bonds for a fixed period, the States to pay
the interest on their respective quotas, and redeem the
bonds -when they mature, and the Commonwealth to
contribute a quota. We are prepared to appoint a
Committee of the Treasurers of the States and the
Treasurer of the Commonwealth to go into the question
of what the quota of the Commonwealth should be. The


quotas of the States are on a per capita basis, Tasmania,
which is not affected, being excluded. I suggest to
you that we affirm this scheme, that we get legislative
authority, that the Commonwealth and the States co-
operate in this very necessary measure, and that we
get on with the work.
The PRESIDENT.—The Conference considered
your proposals this morning, and decided to ask what
the Commonwealth would be prepared to contribute
towards making the uniform gauge— {a) on the main
lines between the capitals, and (b) for general conver-
sion.
Mr. HUGHES.—I cannot toll you that, because I
do not know how much it will cost. But if you say
to me, “ Including the Commonwealth, there will be
six of us in it; will you contribute one-sixth?” then we
will talk that matter over, give you an answer, and
have done with it. We cannot say how much money
we will contribute, because we do not know how much
money the work will cost; but I have been told that it
will cost £16,000,000 to provide a uniform gauge be-
tween Perth and Brisbane.
Mr. SC ADD AN.—That is about two-thirds of what
it will cost.
Mr. HUGHES.—I am only telling you what my
Engineer for Rail-ways has told me. It is no use my
saying that I will give you £4,000,000, because that has
no definite relation to the whole amount. I say that
we will pay a definite proportion; and if yon say that
one-sixth is a fair thing, we shall be satisfied. We
will raise the money by non-negotiahle bonds, the States
will pay the interest, and we will pay our share.
Mr. SOADDAN.—WiII you pay interest on your
quota ?
Mr. HUGHES.—We will pay the interest on our own
bonds. We shall do a lasting service to our country by
agreeing to this scheme and getting on with the work.
I am quite satisfied that a great many of the difficul-
ties will disappear when we start. It is impossible to
borrow money. You talk about what you are going
to borrow in England, and Mr. Fihelly was speaking
like a story out of the Arabian Nights of what the
Queensland Government proposed to do. It is very
difficult to borrow money abroad, and we shall just
have to try to raise money here as best wo can. I know
no better way than by those bonds. I have great
faith in the possibilities of Australia, and great belief
in its powers of recuperation. I submit my proposal
to you,_ and I hope that yon will, without very lengthy
diseussion, assent to it, and agree to procure from your
respective Legislatures the authority that is necessary
for effect to be given to it.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I think the attitude of New South
Wales as a State regarding this matter is most important
to the Conference, and as Mr. Storey did not
rise, I am taking advantage of the opportunity.
The proposal is that New South Wales is to
contribute one-fifth of the cost of the work, al-
though its railways require no alteration at all.
The -scheme at present is only a half-baked one. If
you are talking of defence you are talking, perhaps, of
Port Darwin, perhaps of North Queensland. Taking
the line to Brisbane as the terminal station is hardly
nutting the thing in the region of practical politics.
Even then I doubt whether your Minister and his
officers in charge of the railways reckoned that a bridge
cost-ng half-a-million might have to he built across the
Brisbane River. The fact seems also to have been for-
gotten that we have a north-coast railway which in
twelve or eighteen months will be connected with
Cairns. I would point out that from the New South
Wales border to Beandesert is only 78 miles. This is
not a complete plan for the transformation of the lines
to a standard gauge. At the same time we must wel-
come the introduction of the matter into the realms of
the practical. Ido not think the States would object
to make a bigger contribution than the Commonwealth
as a mere matter of equity. Yesterday I mentioned
in connexion with this matter as affecting the whole
of the people of Australia that I would he prepared to
hand over our trunk lines to the Commonwealth and
let the other lines act as feeders. Ido not say that
my colleagues here or in Queensland would agree to it,
but that is the mental angle of my outlook. It is
more an earnest of my honesty, which Sir Joseph Cook
referred to. The suggestion that the Federal and the
State Treasurers should meet is a happy one. Let us
hope that they will do so and evolve something that
reach fruition.
Mr. SCADDAN.—-I remember this matter being dis-
cussed at previous Conferences, and invariably the final
decision has been to get further time to consider it —
in other words, to shelve it. As the Prime Minister
points out, delay means getting further into difficulties,
because every additional mile of railway constructed
makes it more costly to bring about a uniform gauge.
The question whether it is desirable to standardize the
gauge of all our railways can be considered later. I
know it is one; which presses hardly on Victoria. From
the Western Australian point of view, it is not so
urgent, and we could get on very well without having
to provide more than a 4-ft. line to Kalgoorlie.
We might take up the line from the eastern border
of our agricultural lauds to the gold-fields. The point
I want to emphasize is that, from a purely Western
Australian stand-point, there is no urgency. The
matter can only be urgent from a defence point of view,
and no other, as far as Western Australia is concerned,
although the alteration might dispense with a little
discomfort to passengers who have to put up with the
change of grains at Kalgoorlie, which is hardly worth
mentioning. We can do with the existing line between
Fremantle and Kalgoorlie all that we shall be called
upon to do for the next ten years. However, if the
Federal Government thinks that, from a defence point
of view, there should be no break of gauge, we would
be willing to meet them fairly in the matter. -The
proposal now is that the whole cost of the line from
Fremantle to Brisbane should ho borne on a per capita
basis. I have not consulted the Premier with regard
to it, but I should say that ho would embrace the op-
portunity, because instead of our State having to pro-
vide £4,000,000 to provide a 4-ft. B|-in line between
Fremantle and Kalgoorlie, New South Wales would
come along and help us materially. What I should
like is a guarantee that they will meet their interest
on the bonds, otherwise they will fall hack on us.
Divided among the States and the Commonwealth it
will mean that we shall have to pay £40,000 per an-
num in the way of interest and sinking fund charges,
while we shall not get an additional Is. revenue, al-
though we may save a little in working expenses. We
have big developmental works in hand, and people who
are settled on the lands are demanding the means of
getting their produce to market. To take £40,000
from our revenue is asking a good deal. There has
been talk about repudiation by Western Australia. As
a matter of fact, when the undertaking was given by
Sir Walter James away hack in 1903 or earlier, it
was on the distinct understanding, and it was so stated,
that the Federal Government would construct the
transcontinental line within a certain number of years,
and they failed to do so. But what I say is that we
are still under an obligation to make that 4-ft. B|-in.
line between Fremantle and Kalgoorlie, and sooner or
later must do so, hut is it desirable with the state
Western Australia is in at the present moment, with a
big developmental policy on hand, and a strong demand
for land settlement in the country where there is no
railway communication, that we should, because of


this proposition, have to ask those settlers to do with-
out railways? Outside the question of actual defence
there is no warrant for the expenditure of a single
penny on the alteration of that line as far as Western
Australia is concerned.-
Mr. FIHELLY.—We could get out of it by build-
ing 78 miles ourselves.
Mr. HUGHES.—I think that Queensland has a
better case, but as an Australian citizen I put it that
such a line is necessary.
Mr. SCADDAH. —I agree that wc are living in a
fool’s paradise in the event of our having to defend
our shores against an attack from overseas.
It is getting worse every year. But we must face the
position as we find it. I do not see how we can get
this money. That is the point. After all, the great
difficulty exists in the eastern States, mostly between
Victoria and Hew South Wales, and, to some extent,
South Australia. This matter has been before Con-
ferences on many occasions, and has been reported on
by engineers; yet while the matter was still under dis-
cussion, South Australia built a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge to
connect with a 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge, so that if we have to
bring produce by rail—and we cannot always depend
on getting it by sea —we have to bring it through Vic-
toria and South Australia, instead of being able to do
so by a 4-ft. B|-in. gauge from Broken Hill to Port
Augusta. The jealousies between the States must have
had some effect in the carrying out of this work. At
the present moment, this matter is not so urgent, so far
as Western Australia is concerned. On the other hand,
we have many settlers in various parts of Western
Australia who are now languishing because they can-
not get their produce to market. They want railway
facilities. On the top of that, we can hardly agree to
this expenditure when it is purely for defence pur-
poses, and may not be required for some time. If it
were absolutely necessary at the present moment, I
suppose we would be prepared to find our share of the
money.
Mr. HUGHES.—It has to be done.
Mr. SCADDAH.—The Prime Minister looks at this
matter from the defence point of view. He cannot say
that uniformity is necessary from a commercial point
of view. Still, he is only willing to contribute one-
sixth of the expenditure, and that is not a fair propor-
tion. Let me tell the Prime Minister about the sug-
gested repudiation. We offered, some years ago, to
undertake the construction of that line if the Common-
wealth would find the money and guarantee the in-
terest for five years. After that term, we were pre-
pared to undertake the whole of the responsibility.
The Commonwealth Government, however, would not
agree. That was a fair proposition. I suggest, now,
that the Commonwealth should increase its contribu-
tion, and then, when the traffic becomes permanent, the
States might carry the whole responsibility.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—It is really an outrage when
you cannot get money at any time you want it.
Mr. SCADDAH.—We have not to beg so much for
the money we want. We are generally able to get
what we require.
. Mr. LAHG.—The States develop the country'-, and
the Commonwealth exploits them.
Mr. SCADDAH.—When we bring immigrants to
Australia, the Commonwealth pays the States 255. per
head. According to what the Prime Minister said
this morning, each man is worth about £2OO per annum,
and the Commonwealth gets directly about £3 per head.
It returns the States 355. as a sort of sustenance.
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho, no. You did well in the
earlier part of the day, but you are falling from grace
now.
Mr. SCADDAH.—I did not want to say anything
along that line, hut Sir Joseph Cook made an Interjec-
t:on that was not called for. The point I want to
emphasize is that, if the Commonwealth considers this
work is necessary for defence purposes, it should pay a
larger contribution than is proposed.
Mr. STOREY,—I did not want to say anything in
regard to this matter, because I am beginning to feel
that some of my brother workers, as we say in the
Trades Hall, may imagine that I am trying, merely
because I come from Hew South Wales, to dominate
the Conference. That, however, is not at all the case.
I can assure Mr. Hughes that Hew South Wales will
not shirk its responsibility. The people in that State,
so far as I represent them, are favorable to the Govern-
ment taking entire control of the railways; and while we
cannot achieve everything we want at one step, we can at
least deal with this matter in such a way as to leave the
door open to our ultimately arriving at that goal. Accord-
ing to figures which were supplied in 1913, Hew South
Wales would have to contribute very little towards the
cost of this work, while, on the other hand, the contri-
bution from South Australia would be large. It was
estimated that the latter State would have to pay
£2,770,000', while Hew South Wales would have to find
only £120,000.
Mr. HUGHES.—That was on a different set of con-
ditions.
Mr. STOREY.—WhiIe I remain at the head of the
. Government, I am prepared to pledge Hew South Wales
to find its full quota for carrying on this necessary
work. It is, of course, necessary, more for strategic
purposes than for the promotion of commerce; and the
Federal Government might well consider the advisa-
bility of paying a little more than is proposed. Mr.
Hughes, with the solemnity of a Judge and the elo-
quence of a Demosthenes, thinks that unless this work
is carried out the world is coming to an end. Ido not
agree with that. From the manner in which the Prime
Minister spoke, I gained the impression that the Fede-
ral Government, by the wave of a magic wand, can get
money just when it wants it. If the money can be
found, Hew South Wales will recognise its full respon-
sibility. It will not, however, be so easy to get money
as the Prime Minister thinks. He will find it much
more difficult to get money for this purpose than he
did when he was seeking funds for the defence of the
country when the war was on. The great patriots who
were ready to contribute towards war loans will not be
so willing to render assistance now, unless the Common-
wealth is able to use the War Precautions Act, and say
to the people of this country, “ If you do npt give us
this money, we will take it from you.” I have dis-
cussed this matter with the Chairman of the Railway
Commission, and while I am not at liberty to repeat
what was said, I can say in a general way that we agreed
with the determination that has been come to as indi-
cated by the -speech made by Mr. Hughes to-night.
1 believe the Prime Minister thinks that we are likely
to get some money from Germany that will help us.
The need of this work, as he stated, is obvious; but the
only trouble is the getting of the money,
Mr. HUGHES.—If we cannot get it that is the end
of it. You are only asked to assent to a proposal
which says that the Commonwealth shall make ar-
rangements for raising money by issuing bonds.
Mr. STOREY.—I am prepared to pledge our State,
because I believe the people will readily acquiesce in
this proposal. We want people, we must develop our
land, and we must have a uniform gauge. We heartily
agree with all these, but the only difficulty is how we
are to get the money.
Mr. RITCHIE.—May I be permitted to give the
position from the South Australian stand-point? It
was decided by the Government there to construct a
new line, to give better facilities between Port Augusta
and Adelaide, With that object in view, the first part


of the line was laid down from Salisbury to Long
Plains. That portion of the line has been completed.
We are now waiting for the Railways Standing Com-
mittee to present their report to Parliament next ses-
sion. It will be accepted by Parliament, because we
have accepted tenders for the work, which was referred
back to the Railways Standing Committee on account
of a report we had from Mr. Anthony, a leading rail-
way expert from the Malay Peninsula. If it is in-
tended to carry that line straight on inside the ranges
it will give a run from Adelaide to Port Augusta in six
hours if the gauge is to be uniform. If we are to fol-
low the narrow gauge from Adelaide to Port Augusta
the journey will occupy about fourteen hours; but
with the line straight through the journey can be done
in six hours. Some decision will have to be arrived
at in connexion with this matter. I presume the bet-
ter system would be to put it on the inside track, which
would facilitate the goods and passenger traffic. What-
ever system we have will affect the South Australian
railways very seriously. We have a good many lines
coming in, and this will intensify our difficulty. It
will have the effect of making transfer stations at every
junction where the narrow-gauge lines come in contact
with the 4-ft. 8-|-in. gauge. While we are considering
the through line to connect Brisbane with Perth, why
not include all the lines on the coastal side of that
railway? In that event, all the lines running to the
coast would not necessitate any transfer. That would
remove a very great objection to the proposal before us.
A great point has been made of a through line connect-
ing the six capitals from a strategic point of view. To
have every line as part of the 4-ft. B|-in. system is a
matter that should be considered by the Conference.
The cost will not be very great. I should like this
to be included in the general scheme, for it would help
us to get the necessary legislation through our Parlia-
ment.
The PRESIDENT. —I have no motion before me.
I may say that, as to Victoria, if the proposal is to con-
vert the line from Albury to Melbourne to the 4-ft. 8-J-
-in. gauge it would merely be a transfer of the trouble,
and congestion from Albury to Melbourne. If we are
to have a uniform gauge we must convert the Victorian
system to the gauge decided upon. The gauge decided
on is the 4-ft. 8-j-in. In 1912 it was estimated that
the cost would be £37,000,000, and that the cost of a
modified scheme would be £12,000,000. My advisers
tell me that the cost may now be estimated as double
that of 1912. lam prepared to admit the urgency and
the wisdom of a uniform gauge from a defence and
from a commercial point of view. Our Cabinet
would have to consider the matter in respect to the
financial obligation entailed on the State, notwithstand-
ing the proposal that there should be a distribution of
the cost amongst the States, and that the Common-
wealth would bear a quota- I would not be prepared
to bind the Cabinet to the acceptance of the proposition.
The Treasurer would have to go into the whole matter
and advise the Cabinet. The Commonwealth Govern-
ment say that they will finance a loan for the States.
That would be an addition to the interest burden that
we are called upon to bear. While I agree with the
Prime Minister that this must be done, and whilst I
know that delay has meant increased cost, yet, without
considering it with my colleagues in Cabinet and know-
ing what proportion the Commonwealth would be pre-
pared to pay, I do not feel that I can go further than
express general affirmation of the policy and promise
that the matter will be fully considered by the Cabinet.
Mr. HUGHES.—That means, as far as I can see,
that nothing is to be done with the assent of the Vic-
torian Government. You will remember that it is three
or four weeks since I sent the agenda paper on
which this matter of the break of gauge prominently
figured. You will forgive me if I say that I see no
reason to believe that the Victorian Government would
be in any better position to arrive at a decision after
to-day than it was before. It knew very well that this
question was coming on. It knows how urgent it is.
It knows that there are over 1,000 trucks to-day full of
fodder stuck up at the border. That is only one thing.
It knows, because the accumulated evidences are over-
whelming, that there is no real answer to the demand
for expediting the work. You, yourself, Mr. President >
have put forward, perhaps, the best argument of all,
namely, that your officers have told you it will cost
twice as much to do the work to-day as it would have
cost in 1912. Every year it will cost more. Every year
you are building more 5-ft. 3-in. lines; other States
are building lines of other gauges. You are the
guardian of your own fortunes, and you are the master
in your own household. ¥e can do nothing without
your assistance. -As a citizen of the Commonwealth,
I appeal to you. You owe a duty to the Common-
wealth, and, although the taxpayers of Victoria are
also citizens of this State, they are, primarily, Austra-
lians ; and there is nothing more likely to create an
Australian sentiment, and to do away with these
vexatious and entirely unnecessary hindrances to com-.
mercial and other intercourse than a uniformity of
gauge. We have lost millions during this drought from
this very want. Probably we have lost as much as
would have sufficed to do the best part of the work.
I appeal to you, Mr. President. You are the head of
this State. No matter what you do, you will be
criticised. Mr. Storey said of me this afternoon that
I was continually being attacked. So I am. On the
day on which I am not attacked I shall begin to cen-
sure myself, because I shall know that I have lost
whatever little virtue I have—a virtue which consists,
in my opinion, in “getting on with the job.” This is
the measure of the man, in my opinion—it is not what
he says, but what he does. This job has got to be done.
Unless you assist us we cannot get on with it, and you
are sticking up the whole of Australia.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Not the whole of Australia. This
scheme only goes half way up Australia—to Brisbane.
Mr. HUGHES. —I am not going to say that when
I get to Brisbane I will stop there. We cannot com-
plete this work in a day, and, no doubt, before it is
completed we shall have convinced the people of this
country that our circumstances have so improved that
we shall be able to go on with the good work. The
great thing is to make a start. I say this to you, Mr.
President: You are set in a position of great authority.
You are the object of criticism, and your critics will
assail you if you venture to take any bold step. But,
believe me, you will be utterly crushed if you do not
take a bold step. Those men live longest who take
bold steps. It is true they are assailed by the bitterest
criticism. But, when it comes to the point, those men
who have done nothing are buried deepest. I put
it to you, get on with this work. You have all the in-
ducements in the world to do so. The work is neces-
sary for the defence of the Commonwealth, and for
the commercial development of the Commonwealth.
You are able to stop us. I hope you will not do that.
I hope you will go to your Cabinet and recommend
them to adopt this scheme. We have a difficult task.
As Mr. Storey indicated, we have to raise the money.
We may fail; but if we fail because the money cannot
be raised, we shall, at least, have done our best. My
colleagues and I will try to raise the money. This
country is a very prosperous country. I know the pre-
sent position in New South Wales, of course. But take
the country by-and-large, it is a very prosperous coun-
try, and we shall be taking a step that will make it
still more prosperous. We are giving good security.
We are not asking for anything for nothing. We are


offering as good a return as any man could get —an
absolutely gilt-edged security. If I were a rich man,
I would rather lend to the State than invest my money
in any private enterprise, because there will be no
fluctuations. It will stand steady, no matter what
extremists might do. It will be the last to go if ever
there is an attack on property. I despondent
about raising the money. I may be, perhaps, unduly
optimistic. I hope, Mr. President, that you will not take
up the stand you have indicated. I can understand
your position. Your State has a perfect network of
5-ft. 3-in. railways. T, as head of the Common-
wealth, put it to you that,', if you persist in your atti-
tude, then you will kill this project utterly. I will
be no party to shelving the question. I shall say, if it
is shelved; This means a definite refusal to unify the
gauges of this Commonwealth. There are more ways
of killing a dog than choking him with butter, and
when men say they will go on and mean they won’t go
on, what are you to conclude? I say to you, Mr. Law-
son, the position in which you are placed to-day, not
only as Premier of this State, but as President of this
Conference, makes your attitude doubly important,
and, if you refuse, I, for one, shall say that nothing
further can be done in the matter. I shall state my
position quite clearly to the electors. I believe in this'
scheme. My Government believe in it. And what are
we to do? We have not any power. If we have any,
I do not know where to look for it. For all practical
purposes, we are as powerless as a man in England
would be to do the work. You can help us. All I
ask is that you will do what the other members of the
Conference have done, and assent to a proposal to cast
on us the responsibility of finding the money, and upon
the Treasurers in Committee of deciding among them-
selves what is a fair quota for the Commonwealth.
Mr. SCADDAN.—Is it essential that you should at
once take up the line between Melbourne and Albury—
the 5-ft. 3-in. railway? Cannot you duplicate it for
the purpose of avoiding the break of gauge, as the
Premier suggests?
The PRESIDENT.—The Prime Minister has inter-
preted my statement as opposition to the proposal. I
said I should require to consider the matter very fully
with my colleagues in relation to its financial aspect.
The Prime Minister said that he had advised us that
this matter was on the agenda paper. That is true.
But not until 10 o’clock this morning did we receive
the specific proposals which he has submitted.
We asked the Prime Minister, “ What quota are you
prepared to pay?” and in regard to that he has made
the suggestion that the Treasurers should confer. I
have an estimate, not up to date, and I am told by
my advisers that the work is going to cost very much
more, and that it will commit us to the complete con-
version of the Victorian 5-ft. 3-in. gauge to the 4-ft.
84-in. gauge. It seems to me that my, attitude is
reasonable. While affirming the wisdom of a uniform
gauge, I want to know what it is going to cost Vic-
toria.
Mr. FIHELLY.—That is the attitude we all take
up.
The PRESIDENT.—I want to know the cost before
I commit myself or my Government to the acceptance
of the proposal which the Prime Minister has put for-
ward.
Mr. HUGHES.—Nobody can give you that infor-
mation. I have never known an estimate yet for a
great work that was not exceeded by at least 50 per
cent.
Mr. FIHELLY.—We would be reckless if we said
we would go on with the work without consulting our
Cabinets, and without knowing where the money is
coming from.
The PRESIDENT. —I want to see this work done.
It is a necessary and desirable work; but we want to
knew how much it is going to cost, and how we are
going to finance it. It is true the Commonwealth
says, “We are going to raise the money ”; hut Vic-
toria has to find its share.
Mr. FIHELLY.—The Commonwealth will have to
declare its policy north of the Queensland border.
Mr. HUGHES. —What we are talking about now
ought not to be, and must not be, mixed up with any-
thing else. We are talking about unifying the gauge
of the existing main lines. As a first step, we take the
unifying of the gauges of the main lines from Perth
to Brisbane. We do not say that we shall stop there,
and we do not say that that is the only railway pro-
ject that the Commonwealth has. For instance, wo
are committed to South Australia to build a line from
the north to the south of Australia. Subject only to
finance, we propose to go on with that, and whether
wo or the Queensland Government should bring in a
spur line from Cammoweal to it is a matter we shall
be very glad to discuss with the Queensland represen-
tatives.
Mr. STOREY. —Has not this point struck the Presi-
dent? It was estimated that the cost of altering the
gauge of the whole system some years ago would be
£6,000,000. Assuming that it would take £12,000,000
now, and that it would take six years to do the work,
that would be only £2,000,000 a year. The interest
on £2,000,000 would be all the Victorian Government
would be required to find.
Mr. SC ADD AN.—lt would be less, because the pay-
ment would be on a per capita basis.
Mr. STOREY.—It is only proposed to deal with
the main lines.
The PRESIDENT.—Supposing the gauge of the
lines from Albury to Melbourne and from Melbourne
to Serviceton were to be altered to 4 ft. 84 in., all the
lines coming to them would have to be altered, other-
wise at every junction station there would be conges-
tion through the trouble of changing.
Mr. STOREY.—If the main lines throughout the
various States are altered to the 4-ft. 84-in. gauge,
the other lines that are connected with them will not
necessarily have to be altered at once. Only those
lines the trains from which use the main lines for the
■purpose of reaching their destination would have to
be altered. I think the Treasurers ought to be able to
estimate fairly closely the cost of the work, and that
the Premier of Victoria will find his burden will not
be nearly so great as he anticipates.
The PRESIDENT.—I should be delighted if, after
considering what the financial burden to this State
would be, the Victorian Government were able to say
“ Yes.”
Mr. HUGHES.—The cost of having a uniform
gauge for the lines from Perth to Brisbane is esti-
mated at £16,000.000. The interest on that will be
about £BOO.OOO. On a per capita basis Victoria’s share
would be £187,000. and you have to deduct from that
the Commonwealth proportion. The Victorian
Government have spent a great deal of money on the
electrification of the Melbourne and suburban rail-
ways. They have spent enough money there to pay
the interest on this scheme many times over. I do
not know that £187,000 is such a great expenditure for
a national work of this kind that the Premier of Vic-
toria ought to hesitate about it. However, he has
spoken, and like the last of the Mohicans, that finishes
it. I will only say that if he will allow his Treasurer
to meet with the Treasurers of the other States and
the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to-morrow, they
will be able to go into the matter a little more closelv,
and they will be able to furnish an estimate that will
enable him to see within reason what his liability
would be. Can we leave it at that?
The PRESIDENT.—Yes.


Mr. HARWELL.—I should like to ask the Prime
Minister whether he intends to go on with the north-
south transcontinental line before proceeding with this
work of gauge unification?
Mr. HUGHES.—I should not like to say. When
Mr. Lawson had finished speaking just now I would
have laid 100 to 1 that we would have built that north-
south line and see it grow into a flourishing and pay-
able institution long before we started the other, but I
do not know how Mr. Lawson will feel about the matter
to-morrow. We will certainly start the north-south
line.
Mr. HARWELL.—When?
Mr. HUGHES.—At this very moment we are con-
sidering suggestions with regard to the route and con-
struction. The only thing that stands in our road is
the thing that stands in our road here, and that is
finance.
Mr. STOREY.—Perhaps the Prime Minister would
outline what the Federal Government proposes to do
in connexion with the question of per capita payments?
Mr. HUGHES.—To-morrow, if I have the oppor-
tunity of discussing the matters with such of my col-
leagues as are not on various Committees, I shall be
prepared to come again at 2.30 p.m. and deal with
finance, industrial questions, and those other matters
that are on this list, as far as we are able to dispose
of them.
The PRESIDENT.—Are you going to deal with
the Convention?
Mr. HUGHES. No, I am not dealing with it.
You can raise the matter if you like, and I shall be
glad to hear anything you have got to say on it. I
propose to speak on the question of the powers of the
Commonwealth in industrial legislation, as well as that
of finance under its various sub-headings, and one of
those sub-headings is that which keeps on cropping up
in this discussion, and which we can, I hope, satisfac-
torily settle.
Mr. FIHELLY.—Has the Convention gone to the
gallows ?
Mr. BARWELL.—Is it the intention of the Prime
Minister to convene a Convention to review the Con-
stitution ?
The PRESIDENT.—I think we are getting a little
bit out of order. Let us agree to a motion on the
break of gauge question.
Mr. STOREY.—I move—
That the Prime Minister’s proposals be referred to a Com-
mittee of the Treasurers for immediate consideration and
report.
The motion was agreed to.
CONTENTION FOR REVISION OF COMMON-
WEALTH CONSTITUTION.
Mr. BARWELL. —Now I should like to know whe-
ther the Prime Minister can indicate what his inten-
tions are with regard to the Convention for reviewing
the Constitution ?
Mr. HUGHES. I can give you an answer in a
very few words. My intention is to introduce legis-
lation to provide for the calling of a Convention.
Mr. FIHELLY.—When ?
Mr. HUGHES.—This session.
The PRESIDENT.—You are not prepared to out-
line the Bill, I suppose?
Mr. HUGHES.—No.
COAL .CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION.
The PRESIDENT. —There is one other matter with
which we might deal this evening. The resolution in re-
gard to coal control moved by Mr. Soaddan was pre-
sented to Sir Joseph Cook to-day. He has agreed to
keep the Central Control Board in existence, and has
requested direct State representation* of those States
that are sufficiently interested. Victoria has al-
ready direct representation. South Australia is pre-
pared to nominate a representative, and Tasmania is
also prepared to do so. If the other States are
anxious to have representatives, Sir Joseph Cook is
quite willing that they should have direct representa-
tion. .The question of the distribution of supplies
within the State is a matter for subsequent negotiation
between the States and Sir Joseph Cook.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—About this matter, I should
like to say that it appears to me that now that the con-
ditions under which the Central Coal Board was
brought into existence are over, the sooner the central
Government acquits itself of responsibility the better.
After all, it is a State matter, and my suggestion is
that the States appoint members to constitute a Central
Committee, the States themselves taking full responsi-
bility for all that is done.
Mr. SCADDAN.—We have no powers.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—A State must always have
the power of control within its own borders, and I sug-
gest very respectfully that you have all the powers we
have as far as the Central Board is concerned. You
can do nothing in this matter of rationing the States
with coal except in co-operation with the Inter-State
shipping companies, just as we are doing to-day. We
have no control over them, as they have been absolutely
released. To go on as we have been doing in connexion
with the coal supply, and at the same time to release
the shipping, is quite anomalous, and more or less
absurd. I want each of the States to appoint one repre-
sentative to deal with this matter. I strongly suggest
that you keep the three men who are now on the
Central Board. They know the whole matter from
Ato Z, and have done magnificent work. The three
1 refer to are Mr. Gibson, Mr. Griffith, and Mr. H.
Brookes. They worked like Trojans for four years, and
all the thanks they have had is the_ abuse of the Age. I
am glad to say that no one outside the Age thinks as it
does. The point, however, is that whatever is done
must be done on the responsibility of the States con-
cerned. We will give any help that is needed. The three
men I have mentioned are in touch with the shipping
companies, and if the States appoint representatives
as I suggest, the whole matter can be worked very well.
I propose to get away from the responsibility of having
anything to do with the distribution of coal within the
States.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You will keep up Inter-State con-
trol?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—No. I suggest that the whole
responsibility rest upon State representatives. lam
quite willing to give every help I can.
Mr. BARWELL.—You will not disband the State
Boards?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I will not disband them until
there is another organization to take their places. We
cannot afford to do that. If you want the services of
Captain Tracey, who has had a great deal to do with
this matter, I will place him at your disposal.
Mr. SCADDAN.—I move—
That the report be read and approved.
Mr. BARWELL seconded the motion, which was
agreed to.

RELATIVES.
The report of the Sub-Committee on railway mat-
ters was considered in committee.
The following recommendation in regard to railway
passes issued to relatives of members of Parliament was

RAILWAY MATTERS.
The report from the sub-Committee on railway mat-
ters which had been referred back to the suh-Coxnmittee
the previous day was brought up, and (on the motion of
Mr. SCADDAN, seconded by Mr. COYNE) the follow-
ing recommendation with regard to railway passes for
ex-Eederal Ministers was approved:—
(a) That the Conference reaffirms the following resolution
of the Conference of Premiers in 1918:
That life passes issued to Prime Ministers or
Premiers who have held office for one year, Presi-
dents of the Senate, and Speakers of the House of
.Representatives, Presidents of the Legislative Coun-
cils and Speakers of the Legislative Assemblies
who have held office for three years, Cabinet Min-
isters who have held office for four years In the
aggregate, shall be recognised over Federal and
State railways by the issue of gold passes, available
over all lines, to such persons,
with the following amendments:
(i) That after the word “passes” in line one
the word “ be ” be inserted;
(ii) That for the word “four” in line four the
word “ three ” be substituted; and
(iii) That before the word “ shall ” in line four
the words “ and that such passes ” be
inserted.
(/)) That arrangements be made for the issue of a uniform
gold pass which shall he recognised on Common-
wealth and State railways.
Consideration of the remainder of the report was
postponed-
iindustrial matters.
The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, accom-
panied by the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook),
the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), and the
Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Groom), at-
tended the Conference.
Mr. HUGHES.—"With your permission, I will deal
now with the questions that are grouped together under
the heading of “ Industrial Matters.” It will be within
your recollection that, at the meeting we had before the
elections, certain propositions were made to you,
namely, that you should favour the granting of powers
to the Commonwealth until a Convention should be
called and have an opportunity to express its opinion;
that we should have power that would enable us to
deal with profiteering, trusts and combines, the national-
ization of monopolies, corporations, and industrial un-
rest. That is what we asked for. There was a differ-
ence of opinion as to what I may term the aftermath
of the war in addition to these. On these points there was
little or no difference of opinion at the Conference.
I think Mr. Coyne was prepared to go a little further
(ban others in regard to industrial matters; but, speak-
ing broadly, there was not very much opposition to the
granting of powers to deal with profiteering, trusts and
combines, the nationalization of monopolies, and indus-
trial unrest. You will remember that, in due course,
these matters were submitted to the people, that they
were advocated most strenuously by myself, my col’
leagues, and the members of the Nationalist party, and


that in some States the Premiers advised the people to
vote against them, while in others the Premiers ad-
vised the people to vote for them. I think it is fair to
say that in no State did any Premier come out and
boldly declare for them; that in no State did any Pre-
mier advocate them in that spirit of enthusiasm and
earnestness which we had desired. The people rejected
them, but by a very narrow majority; and so we have
no power to deal with these very important matters, i
do not propose to touch upon the points raised at the
Conference, but I shall put before you the concrete
propositions in regard to the temporary, or permanent
surrender, if you like, of the* industrial powers that will
enable us to deal with the industrial matters desired.
My memorandum states: —
That the States will pass legislation under section 51
(xxxvii) of the Constitution, referring to the Commonwealth
Parliament legislative powers for the following purposes:—
1. To establish a Commonwealth Industrial Court, with a
roster of Commonwealth and State Judges.
2. To give the Court jurisdiction over so much of the in-
dustrial field as will enable it to prevent and settle
disputes—
(а) which extend to more than one State; and
(б) which, while confined to one State, affect the
whole community.
(3) to create Industrial Boards, whose functions shall
extend over the same part of the industrial field;
(4) to create Industrial Councils, representative of em-
ployers and employees, to bring about agreement as
to industrial conditions, including a general Indus-
trial Council for the whole Commonwealth;
(5) to provide for collective bargaining by industrial
agreements which bind both parties;
(6) to prevent strikes —at least until after procedure
which insures that the strike is the deliberate will
of the majority, after every effort at settlement has
■ been exhausted;
(7) to give effect to the basic wage;
(8) to enable a common rule to be established in an
industry.
We ask you, under section 51, paragraph 37, of the
Constitution, to give us such powers as will enable us
by legislation and administration to give effect to the
proposals which I have • outlined. The present position
is well known. We have a Court of Arbitration and
Conciliation, whose jurisdiction is severely limited,
not only by the terms of the Constitution as originally
understood, but by very many decisions of the High
Court. They severely limited that jurisdiction-
crippled it. It is a Court which is congested to a
point which menaces the industrial safety of the Com-
monwealth. It is well known that a large number of
unions, owing to their very nature, because of the
industries which they represent, have resort to that
Court. A large number of unions are established on
a Federal basis, and, consequently, look to that Court
for redress. If that Court cannot grant redress, it
is a bad thing for Australia. We ask that for this
Court, not for your State Courts, which we leave alone
entirely, there shall be substituted a Court composed
of Commonwealth and State Judges. We believe that
will have the effect of giving more confidence to the
community and to both parties. It would enable the
Court to sit in various States and' he recruited from
Judges of the Industrial Courts of those States, who,
for this particular purpose, would have Federal juris-
diction. It would enable the Court to grapple with
the amount of work which is now too much for it.
In the second paragraph we ask that this Court shall
have jurisdiction over so much of the industrial field
as will enable it to prevent and settle disputes which
extend to more than one State. Looking at the Con-
stitution, it would appear that we have that power,,
but looking at the judgments of the High Court we see
that the power is a very limited one, and that the
words have a severely technical meaning. It has hap-
pened to me, not on one, but on several occasions, that
I have had to recommend unions with which I have
been connected to strike in order to get before the
Court. On the face of it, that is a dangerous procedure,
ahd a procedure incompatible with the rule of law.
It is well known that unions which strike in that way
do get preference of consideration,, while unions that
rely on the strict letter of the law wait in an almost
endless queue for their claims to be heard. We want
to deal with disputes when they extend over the boun-
daries of any one State, and we want to deal with those
disputes which are disputes within the meaning of
the man in the street, the employer and the employee.
W© do not want Courts to tell us what a dispute is.
Every one knows what the people mean by a dispute,
what the employee means by a dispute, and what the
employer understands by that term. We ought not to
waste our time arguing about words. Unfortunately,
the question of industrial unrest and the disputes that
arise in consequence are too real. In sub-paragraph
( h ) we ask power to deal with disputes that are con-
fined to one State but affect the whole community, such
a dispute, for example, as a coal dispute, which might
be confined to Hew South Wales, but which might
paralyze Victoria or South Australia. We consider
that such a dispute is in fact, although not technically,
an Inter-State dispute, and we want power to deal
with it. Paragraphs 3 and 4 ask for powers to create
Industrial Boards and Industrial Councils. As a man
who has had considerable experience of industrial mat-
ters, I say that Courts of Arbitration are the most
clumsy and inefficient way of settling disputes. Ho
doubt, if disputes cannot be settled in any other way
they should be settled that way. These disputes should
be settled in a lawful and peaceful way, but I say that
the best way is for the parties themselves to settle
them. Yesterday Mr. Gann suggested, in connexion
with the Murray Waters question, that the parties
should meet. Take the shipping tribunal, which I
established about three years ago. There you have a
nominee of the Commonwealth, as the employer, and
a representative of the men. That tribunal has worked
satisfactorily. It is ready to settle disputes as and
when they arise, and the record of its operations is
such as to commend it to all of you. I say deliberately
that in Courts of Arbitration, so far as my experience
has gone, this state of things exists: The Judge is
utterly ignorant in the very nature of things of the
details of the industry, the conditions of which he is
asked to settle. Men go into the box, employers and
employees, not to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, but to put the best complexion
on their case, and they do that. I make no distinction
between them. I have represented unions, and never
represented any one else in these Courts, and my busi-
ness has been to make the best case I could. I have done
that, and I say deliberately that I have never prac-
tised before a Judge who had the remotest idea of the
industry.
Mr. FIHELLY.—There you will find the solution
of the congestion—appoint laymen.
Mr. HUGHES.—I am saying that we should have
an Industrial Board. When, instead of long-drawn
arguments before the Court, which is uninformed of
the facts of the industry, we have the parties meeting
across the table, the parties know the facts, and do not
waste time talking about the facts, but come down to the
bed-rock of the dispute. lam in favour of substitut-
ing machinery for the settlement of disputes by Indus-
trial Boards and Industrial Councils. I put Indus-
trial Councils and Industrial Boards on a different
basis. Industrial Councils are necessary to determine


disputes which cannot be settled by Industrial Boards.
The Industrial Board would he a Board attached to
each industry. The Industrial Council would bo a
Council in each State and in the Commonwealth. The
functions of the grand council would be to,survey the
whole industrial field, to ascertain what ailed it,
what remedy was needed, and to endeavour to pro-
mote harmony. We could occupy all the time at our
disposal, and very much more, in talking on this mat-
ter, because it is a matter of the first importance. We
have to get down to bed-rock. It is no use saying to
men, “ Be at rest, he easy, be satisfied.” Why should
they be satisfied ? Why 'should they be easy when con-
ditions are not satisfactory? And why are they not
satisfactory? To some extent it is because there is
between the parties a mutual suspicion born of the
past. We have nothing to do with the past. I be-
lieve the bulk of the employers are prepared now to
start fair, and to treat the employees as a full partner,
in the sense that they are to be met on a footing of
absolute equality, and they are willing to try to find
out what is the matter in order that they may adjust
things. I say that can best be done by giving statu-
tory authority to these Councils, and endeavouring to
devise moans to insure industrial peace. We know
there are unreasonable people on both sides. I do not
think there are more unreasonable people, proportion-
ately, on the side of the men. Hot a bit. There are
some people who are never satisfied. If they had
100 per cent, of the profits they would not bo satisfied.
There are people, never satisfied who want to overturn
the whole industrial system at one stroke. I am not
one of those. I never was one of them. But the
great majority of the people in this country are pre-
pared to do a fair thing one by the other. That I
firmly believe. When men come along and say, “We
want £5 a week,” or “ We want £6 a week,” you have got
to satisfy them that the industry cannot pay it, and you
have, got to satisfy them, not by your mere unsupported
word, but by proof. You cannot get more out of an
industry than you put into it. 1 think if there wore
a greater disposition to lay all the cards on the table
and to discuss the matter in dispute amicably and ex-
haustively, there would be a better understanding be-
tween the parties. I believe in collective bargaining,
and clause 5 provides for that. Of course, that has
long been the practice in the country. I propose to
make, the Commonwealth power clear in regard to it.
How, with regard to clause 6, which deals with the pre-
vention of strikes, what precisely is the power of the
Commonwealth with regard to the prevention of
strikes? I do not know. What is the best course to
adopt with regard to a fire? Is it better to put the
lire out when it is raging at its height, or when it is
smouldering, or is it, better to lay hands on the in-
cendiary about to set fire to material saturated with
petroleum? We want power to prevent the occurrence
of trouble. The Court has not the power. In theory,
it has part of the power, but it has not the power in
an effective way. Of all the strikes I have had to do
with, I have never been in one where a ballot has been
taken .beforehand. 1 have known a strike involving
nearly 20,000 men precipitated by a meeting at which
there were only fifty-two persona present) of whom
probably thirty voted for the strike and twenty-two
against. The great majority of the men in the various
branches of the organization throughout Australia
knew nothing whatever of this. The first intimation
they had was the notice pasted on the walls notifying
them that one. particular branch had decided not to
resume work. What happens at one branch affects all
branches, and consequently thirty men out of nearly
20,000 are able to paralyze the whole Commonwealth.
I think it is time that the Commonwealth had power
in regard to those industries over which it is desired
to give it authority. The Commonwealth should have
power to say, “ Before you strike you must take the
opinion of your men.” I think that is a fair proposi-
tion. Ido not want to rake up the past, but I say
this: There is nobody here, no matter on which side he
sits politically, who has had a longer, a more uninter-
rupted, or a more continuous acquaintance with unions
than I have had, and I athrm that I have never been
in one strike with regard to which a ballot was taken.
Hot one. In most strikes, had a ballot been taken
first, there would have been no strike. Of course, it is
no good, once the trouble has started, to take a ballot.
You might take a million ballots uselessly. It is the
same as with a fire once it is raging. It is no good
talking about peace. What is being talked is not
peace, hut the reducing to pieces of the other man.
What I urge is that it is when the men are calm and
collected that the voice of reason should he heard.
Clause 7 asks that we shall have power to give effect
to the basic wage when determined. lam not going
to elaborate an argument on that clause. It speaks
for itself. The purpose of clause Bis to enable a
common rule to be established in an industry. At the
present time the Court has not the power to establish
a common rule.
Mr. LAHG-. The Board of Trade of Hew South
Wales has fixed the basic wage. I take it that that
would not he disturbed.
Mr. HUGHES. —I do not know what the Common-
wealth tribunal would recommend, hut I would lay all
I am worth in the world that they would not recom-
mend anything less than you have got. We thought
we had the power to enable a common rule to be estab-
lished in an industry long ago. We had not that
power. Clearly, we ought to have it. lam not
going to elaborate the proposals any further. I have
set them out as clearly as I can. I ask you to give
us these powers, and to do so without delay. You can
limit them, if you like, as to time, in the same way as
you did the others. That is to say, you can give them
to us until the Convention meets, deals with the matter,
and submits the question to the people, and the people
have an opportunity of expressing their opinion. That
opinion, of course, when expressed, will settle the thing
definitely. Or, if you like, you can give us the powers
permanently. I asked the people in October or Hovem-
ber for the full powers to deal with industrial matters,
industrial disputes, and industrial unrest; but the
people declined to give them, and, as I have said, the
Premiers were very lukewarm on the matter. Some
of them w-ere not even lukewarm, and the proposal was
lost. If the Premiers had been as earnest and em-
phatic on the matter as I was, that proposal would be
law to-day. 'Since we are talking about referenda
and ballots, I do not mind saying that an overwhelm-
ing number of unionists of Australia, if they had the
chance, would not only vote in favour of the ballots,
but would go a great deal further. However, your
minds must not he swayed by what the bulk of the
people would do. You must consider the matter on
its merits. I put my proposals before you, and ask
you to express your views, so that we may know exactly
where we stand.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am sorry that I was not
present when the Prime Minister began to speak on
this subject, but I believe I came in very shortly after
he started. I should like to offer a few suggestions on
the honorable gentleman’s proposals, and to say that,
personally, I am very pleased to find that, in the main,
he has adopted the principles that were submitted as
an outcome of the Industrial Conference that was held
some time ago. There are some alterations that rather
appeal to me, and I think there would not be very much
difficulty in accepting the proposals now put forward.


Of course, one -would like a little time in which to
digest them; but, on the whole, they rather appeal
to me. As the Prime Minister knows, this is a subject
in which I have taken considerable interest, and I had
the honour of submitting to him the decisions arrived
at by the Industrial Conference to which I have re-
ferred. The proposal now put forward is that the
Federal Arbitration Court should be replaced by a
Court composed of Commonwealth Judges and State
Judges, who, I understand from the Prime Minister,
would have jurisdiction over disputes extending beyond
the borders of one .State in the first instance. That,
as has been pointed out, was originally the intention
of the Constitution, but, owing to the interpretations
that have been given to it, the Commonwealth powers
have gone a long way further than the original framers
of the Constitution ever thought would go. I
gathered from the remarks of the Prime Minister
that he intends to make the meaning of the phrase,
“ dispute extending beyond the borders of one State,”
very clear. That will be a very great advantage. I
gathered, further, that the Prime Minister proposes
that this Court, in connexion with certain specified in-
dustries, should have power over a dispute that may
exist in only one State. I do not know how far the
honorable gentleman proposes to go with that particu-
lar proposal. In the scheme that was submitted by the
Industrial Conference there was a schedule drawn up
setting out certain specified industries which might
well come under the control of the Federal Court. The
Prime Minister mentioned the coal industry, and that
is one of the industries that was included in the
schedule, because it was felt that coal was practically
the life-blood of the nation, and that if there was any
dispute in the coal industry in New South Wales
which the State Government was quite unable to deal
with, it would paralyze the whole of the manufactur-
ing industries throughout the Commonwealth. It was
felt that the Commonwealth Government should have
power to step in and settle such a dispute by the Fede-
ral machinery set up in the interests of the people as
a whole. Inter-State shipping, which involves the
question of communication between the various States,
was another industry that it was suggested should be
included. The idea that the Federal Court should
have power to come in and deal with certain specified
industries, even although a dispute should be only in
one State, is a very good one; but a difficulty arose
in our Conference, and in the discussion that took
place ultimately with the then Acting Prime Minis-
ter (Mr. Watt) as to the particular industries that
should be handed over by the States to the exclusive
jurisdiction of this Commonwealth Court. It will be
remembered that we came rather to a dead-end as a
result of that discussion. The view then taken by the
Acting Prime Minister was that the Commonwealth
Government were not prepared, in consideration of
the States giving them exclusive jurisdiction over cer-
tain industries, to leave to the States the control of
certain purely domestic affairs, as they might be called,
which, by the stretching of the Constitution, had been
allowed to get under the control of the Federal Court.
The Acting Prime Minister indicated pretty clearly
and emphatically that the Commonwealth Government
would not give back anything that had been allowed
to come under the control of the present Federal
Arbitration Court. If that attitude is to be adopted,
in view of the wide range of industries now under the
Federal Court, it is obvious that there would be prac-
tically nothing left for the State Courts to deal with.
At the present time the great fields over which the
State Industrial Courts are operating are fields over
which the Federal Court, too, is operating, with the
result that we have overlapping and duplication of
awards. We must have some scheme such as the
Prime Minister has put forward to get over the dupli-
cation and overlapping. One of the main questions
to decide is as to just what industries the Federal
Court should have exclusive jurisdiction over, with the
power to make a common rule, and what industries
are to be left to the jurisdiction of the State Courts.
If we can settle that, I am sure this scheme is one
which I shall be able, without giving very much fur-
ther consideration to it, to unreservedly recommend to
my Cabinet and the Parliament of Tasmania to adopt.
It goes a long way to meet a situation which demands
definite action on the part of both the Commonwealth
and the State Governments. The position in the in-
dustrial world has undoubtedly become quite intoler-
able, both to the employer and the employee; and the
people of Australia are looking to Federal and State
legislators to put their heads together to eliminate this
duplication of effort and overlapping of awards. It
is absolutely necessary that we should simplify our
industrial machinery in this respect, and give to the
workers throughout the Commonwealth a greater
measure of stability, and freedom from harassing re-
strictions and annoyance which follow from having
two Courts operating over the same field.
The PRESIDENT. —Do you think it is clear we
shall not have two Courts dealing with disputes? Take
paragraph (5), which deals with disputes confined to
one State but affecting the whole community. You,
Sir Walter, are agreeing to this on the assumption
that it gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal autho-
rity in regard to certain industries, while it leaves
other industries exclusively to the States.
Mr. HUGHES. —There is also this point, that we
do not want the High Court to be continuously ap-
pealed to on technical points as to whether we have
jurisdiction or not in certain disputes. We want to do
without that appeal to the High Court.
Sir WALTER LEE. —I agree that, within the exclu-
sion, they should have absolute power. A proposal has
also been put forward in regard to Industrial Boards
and Industrial Councils. With this I am in perfect agree-
ment. I may say, in passing, that in the last election
we recently went through in Tasmania we put up this
scheme, which is a reasonable adaptation of the
Whitley scheme as part of the industrial policy for our
State. That is to say, we proposed to enlarge the
powers of our Wages Boards failing any legislation
such as is now suggested by the Federal Government.
We also intended to provide for the creation of Indus-
trial Councils in any one industry or groups of in-
dustries, allowing those concerned to meet together,
make their own agreements, and have them registered,
so that they would have the same force of law as if
they had been framed through the ordinary channels
in the Industrial Court. We want these agreements
to he voluntarily arrived at between employer and em-
ployee, and so bring about that amicable relationship
which the Prime Minister is aiming at in these pro-
posals. This scheme will go a long way to solving
many of our industrial difficulties, if we can only get
the employer and the employee to meet together in a
reasonable frame of mind.
Mr. LANG.—You cannot stop them from, meeting if
they want to.
Sir WALTER LEE. —That may be so, but this will
be an encouragement for them to do so; and there is
this additional advantage, that the agreements will be
registered and have the same force of law as if they
had been arrived at in the ordinary way. In regard
to the prevention of strikes, every one must admit that
something should be done in that direction. I quite
agree with the Prime Minister that, if we had had
some such provision as this in existence many year*


ago, a number of the great strikes would never have
taken place. It is reasonable to expect that the demo-
cratic principle involved will be readily accepted by
the people of Australia. How, with regard to the basic
wage. I am not quite sure how the Prime Minister
proposes to establish the basic wage. I understand
that at the present time a Commission is taking
evidence on this particular matter. With all due re-
spect, it appears to me father a cumbersome way of
arriving at what is desired. I think the end could
be obtained in a very much simpler way, and, if I
remember aright, I put an idea forward when discuss-
ing this matter some time ago before an Industrial
Conference of which Mr. Barwell was a member. My
suggestion was that a Commonwealth Judge and State
Judges should meet together and fix the basic wage.
Then, from that basic wage, each of the Judges of
the Commonwealth and the State Court would start
as ia basis. Each Judge would know the particular
circumstances which were operating in his own State,
and would endeavour to get uniformity in regard to
awards. I do not want it to he understood a‘s sug-
gesting that there should be the same dead level of
wages over the whole of Australia, because, as I under-
stand the position, it would be possible to have a
basic wage for the northern part of Australia which
would be quite different from that which would apply
to Victoria or Tasmania. Apart from that, it must
always he borne in mind that there is a difference
between the basic and the minimum wage. The basic
wage need not be the minimum wage. It is merely
the starting point from which to fix the rates of wages
to apply in different parts of Australia, and which, to
a large extent, would vary according to the fluctuations
in the cost of living. In the fixing of the minimum
wage, consideration, of course, would be given to skill,
the nature of the work, climatic conditions, and things
of that sort. I would respectfully urge that, instead
of what I believe to be a cumbersome method of arriv-
ing at the basic wage now being followed, the simpler
method that I have suggested should he adopted. After
the basic wage bas been fixed in tbe way I suggest,
the Judges would be in a better position to frame their
awards in their respective Courts from time to time.
Summing up my position, I am prepared to say that,
subject to any discussion which may elucidate points
not quite clear to me from my brief perusal of this
scheme, it commends itself to me as one which I can
recommend favorably to my Cabinet.
Mr. BARWELL.—As Sir Walter Lee has said, I
was a member of the Conference of Ministers of In-
dustry which met, about three years ago, in Mel-
bourne to consider this particular question. Apart
from that, the matter is one to which I have given a
good deal of thought. For sixteen years I was a re-
sident of Port Pirie, a large industrial centre, and
then, as a barrister, I have been engaged for many
years in the Industrial Courts. I have also held the
office of Minister of Industry in South Australia.
This matter is one of the most important that have
come before the Conference. All the States have in-
dustrial unrest, and, indeed, it is experienced all the
world over. We have causes apart from the general
causes that are inevitable as the result of the war.
One of the greatest causes is absolutely fundamental.
The present system of industrial control is defective,
and this is a matter that goes to the root of the whole
trouble. That the present system is defective, every
one admits. The only point on which we disagree is
as to what the remedy should be. The present system
is both Federal and State. As far as Shate control
goes, I may say that in our own State we have the
Wages Boards, just as they have in Victoria.
Sir WALTER LEE.—We also have them.
9618.—7
Mr. BA EM ELL.—These Wages Boards are com-
posed of representatives of employers and employees,
with an independent chairman, and they are some-
what on the Whiteley lines. They form a very good
industrial tribunal. We have also a State Industrial
Court, and there is an appeal from the Wages Boards
to that Court. We have Industrial Court Judges.
The system in South Australia is one of the best in
the Commonwealth, and probably in the world. It is
a very good system indeed. Then, in addition to State
control, we have Federal control, exercised per medium
of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I recog-
nise that it is only right that there should be a Com-
monwealth control. There are some matters that are
Inter-State in their nature, effect, or extent; and, as
the Premier of Tasmania said, no doubt the framers
of the Constitution had that in mind when they framed
it. They never thought that such an interpretation
would be placed on the Constitution as has been placed
on it by the Commonwealth Court. The position at
present is that the Commonwealth Court has juris-
diction over practically the whole realm of industry.
The employees go, first of all to the Wages Boards,
then to the State Court, and finally to the Common-
wealth Court. It is only necessary for the employees
in a similar industry in two States to present demands
to their employers in order to make a dispute Inter-
State. The Federal Court, at present, as I say, exer-
cises jurisdiction over the whole realm of industry,
because the employees can manufacture Inter-State
disputes under the interpretations and the rulings of
the High Court by presenting a log. The result of
this is a multiplicity of litigation. You have the em-
ployer brought before the Wages Board, and you get a
determination. The employee is not satisfied with it,
and he goes to the State Industrial Court. He gets an
award, and, if he is not satisfied with that, it is a
simple matter to get the employees in another State
to present their log, and thus they have an Inter-State
excuse with a right of appeal to the Federal Court,
Clearly, this is a most undesirable state of things. It
is absolutely detrimental to industrial stability and in-
dustrial peace. I say emphatically that industrial
peace in Australia is impossible while we have this
system.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Two competing Courts.
Mr. BARWELL, —Yes. The Premier of Tasmania
hit the nail on the head. These two Courts, instead
of acting in co-operation, act in hostility. The State
Court gives an award, and the Federal Court, when-
ever appealed to, outbids the State Court. Industrial
peace is impossible under these conditions. What is
the remedy? The suggestion was made at the last
Industrial Conference at which I was present that we
should give the Federal Court full power over indus-
trial matters. That would be going from the frying-
pan into the fire. We say that there should be a divi-
sion of control—that there should be a delimitation of
the powers of the two Courts. These were the lines
we proposed, and we thought we were well on the way
to solve the difficulty,
Mr. FIHELLY.—-Do it by Order in Council.
Mr. BARWELL.—-That was provided for. We
said that there could be no effective and no satisfactory
administration of_ control in local industrial matters
except by Courts in close contact with the local condi-
tions. We say that we should maintain local autonomy
for purely local matters, and that we should do away
with overlapping, because that is the greatest trouble
of all—that is, overlapping between the Federal and
the State Courts. In the third place, we should estab-
lish,. as far as possible, uniformity between the Com-
monwealth and the States in fundamentals, such as the
basic wage and the standard conditions of employment.


Sir WALTER LEE.—Don’t you think that that
oould be best accomplished by the Judges of the Court
fixing the basic wage?
Mr. HARWELL.—-Yes. My suggestions involve the
division of jurisdiction. The proposals of the Prime
Minister are defective. I do not know whether he
thinks that there should be an absolutely clear demar-
cation. He includes the following in his proposals: —
That the States will pass legislation, under section 51
(xxxvii) of the Constitution, referring to the Commonwealth
Parliament legislative power for the following purposes: —
(1) To establish a Commonwealth Industrial Court with
a roster of Commonwealth and State Judges.
(2) To give the Court jurisdiction over so much of the
industrial field as will enable it to prevent and
settle disputes—
(a) which extend to more than one State; and
(b) which, while confined to one State, affect the
whole community.
I have a report of the Conference of 1917, at which I
was present. A Committee was then appointed, con-
sisting of the Premier of Tasmania, Mr. Fitz Gerald,
and myself, and, I think, some one else. We recom-
mended that the States should hand over to the Com-
monwealth full control and regulation of the following
industres: —
(a) Seamen and all labour employed on ships, excepting
labour exclusively employed in harbors; (6) wharf labourers
and coal lumpers; {c) all employees engaged in the shearing
of sheep and all labour in connexion therewith; ( d) all em-
ployees engaged in the production of sugar; (e) all em-
ployees engaged in the coal-mining industry; (/) all em-
ployees engaged in the mining and treatment of metalliferous
ores; (g) all employees in the shipbuilding industry; (h)
journalists. ,
The list was not a hard-and-fast one, and oould be
extended from time to time by the addition of indus-
tries, which, in the opinion of the Inter-State Commis-
sion, were materially affected by Inter-State competi-
tion or were Eederal in character. We said what
matters the Eederal Courts should have jurisdiction
in, and the State Courts were to have jurisdiction in
all others. Immediately that report was submitted
to Mr. Watt, who was Acting Prime Minister, he said
that a large area of industrial activity would be with-
drawn from the Commonwealth by the proposal, and
that did not in any way commend itself to him. He
added that he would not consider anything except a
proposal which would supplement the powers already
field by the Commonwealth Court. He would not con-
sider anything which took from the Commonwealth
Court any of the powers which at that time it pos-
sessed. What we said then, and still say, is that it is
absolutely necessary that some of the powers exercised
by the Commonwealth Court should be taken away
from the jurisdiction of that Court in matters entirely
local in their character and extent.
Mr. EIHELLY.—There is no question about it.
Mr. HARWELL.—As far as the States are con-
cerned, I think we are all agreed.
Mr. EIHELLY.—I believe the Prime Minister will
agree to that.
Mr. HARWELL.—I hope he will; but I notice that
he does not say “Yes.” At present, it is possible to
create an Inter-State dispute merely by the presenta-
tion of a log by people who happen to be employed in
similar industries in two States. You see the trouble
and industrial unrest which it leads to.
Mr. HUGHES.—I think I ought to say, now that
you have put it to me, that, in my opinion, there should
be one authority to deal with industrial matters all
over Australia, and that authority should be the Com-
monwealth. Having delivered myself of that observa-
tion, I ask you to agree to what you see in that pro-
position of mine.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Mr. Harwell understands
what that means.
Mr. HUGHES.—-Mr. Harwell asked a question, and
I answered it. I am putting forward what I think is
a modus vivendi.
Mr. HARWELL. —I know —in fact, we all know—
exactly where the Prime Minister stands in the matter.
What he says now, he has said before. His idea is
that the Commonwealth should have control over the
whole industrial field. The States do not agree witfi
him, and the Prime Minister knows that the States do
not, and that it is no use knocking his head against a
stone wall. .So he comes along with a proposition;
but that proposition does not set out that the Prime
Minister is prepared to have an exact and fair de-
limitation of powers such as were suggested by that
Committee in 1917. I think nothing short, of that
would be satisfactory to the States, because we fear a
condition of things such as we have at the present
moment—that is the possibility of the creation of
Inter-State disputes in other industries. If you have
a clear line of demarcation, it is all right, because you
cannot "go beyond that.
Mr. HUGHES.—I agree that, subject to the States
refusing to give complete power, a line of demarca-
tion, clear and unmistakable, is one of the essentials
of industrial peace. Wo one knows now where he is.
Mr. HARWELL.—Recognising that he cannot get
for the Commonwealth all he would like, the Prime
Minister has come round to what is in my own mind.
Mr. HUGHES.—I will not say that. I have come
down with a proposition, which I have placed before
you.
Mr. HARWELL. —It does not go to the extent you
have indicated.
Mr. EIHELLY.—The Prime Minister has amended
it to that extent.
Mr. HUGHES.—If you look at it you will see
it gives the States something which they have never
had before. Instead of a Commonwealth Court, with
Federal Judges, it is a Court on which Commonwealth
and State Judges will sit. To that extent you get
co-ordination and the prevention of overlapping, and
the States, qua States, are able to exercise influence
on the judgment of the Court. I remember that, in
the boot industry, it was held, by Mr. Justice Heydon,
I think, that he could not give what was asked for
because of the competition in other States. If there
had been a Commonwealth Court, on which Mr. Jus-
tice Heydon had been sitting, and some one from
Queensland had been sitting on it, that could have
been got over. They would have recognised the facts,
and given an award.
Mr. EIHELLY.—You are au optimist.
Mr. HUGHES.—I am a dyspeptic.
.Mr. HARWELL. —The States would all agree that
this is an infinitely better Court than the present
Court. I do not care who the man may be, even if
he is the cleverest and broadest man in the world, he
should not have placed on his shoulders the respon-
sibility and powers which the President of the Arbitra-
tion Court has at present.
Mr. HUGHES.—It does get over that.
Mr. HARWELL.—Yes. My own idea with regard
to the matter was that we want something in addition
to the division of control. Mere division of control
would not do away with all the difficulties, because you
will still have the various State Courts exercising
jurisdiction in matters which come within their juris-
diction, and you want some standardizing authority.
Take South Australia and Victoria, for instance. You
might have Courts in the two States arbitrating in
regard to one particular industry. If different stan-
dards are fixed in the two States, you immediately


have unrest, because you have no standardizing autho-
rity. My idea was that probably a Court of Indus-
trial Appeals would act as a standardizing autho-
rity, and that Court could also fix the basic wage.
Of course, I know that some people say that is too
cumbersome. It means building up your industrial
system, but I do not think it would be cumbersome, be-
cause the right of appeal would only go upon leave
being granted by the Court. Still, here we have
something in the Court suggested by the Prime Minis-
ter which, whilst it is not what was in my mind, could
become a standardizing authority largely because it
would be composed of a Judge appointed by the Com-
monwealth and two State Judges. If the Prime Min-
ister is prepared to go exactly as far as I indicated,
then I am satisfied he will have gone a long way to-
wards solving the problem of industrial unrest, which
is due at the present time to an overlapping of juris-
dictions and to a multiplicity of litigation. I hope
that there will be a due limitation of the powers of the
Federal and the State Courts, and that a proper list
will be drawn up indicating those industries which will
come within the Federal jurisdiction and those which
will come within the State jurisdiction.
The PRESIDEHT.—I have to leave you for about
a quarter of an hour, and I propose, subject to your ap-
proval, to ask my colleague, Mr. Mackinnon, to take the
chair. Before I go I should like briefly to state the
position of the Victorian Government in regard to this
matter. The Prime Minister’s ultimate objective is
perfectly clear. He wants the Commonwealth Go-
vernment to have full control over all questions affect-
ing labour and industry. But not having succeeded in
that, he submits this proposal. How, as that proposal
is interpreted by Sir Walter Lee and Mr. Barwell, I
am prepared to say that I would recommend my Cabi-
net to very favorably consider the matter, and ask
Parliament to consider it. But, as set out in this
memorandum in vague and indefinite terms, I would
not take it to my colleagues nor to the Victorian Legis-
lature. Paragraph ( b ) of clause 2 would cover any-
thing—
(2) To give the Court jurisdiction over so much of the in-
dustrial field as will enable it to prevent and settle dis-
putes—
(a) which extend to more than one State; and
(b) which, while confined to one State, affect the whole
community.
If we can get a clear line of demarcation, and can say
that certain industries are to come under Federal in-
dustrial control, w'hile certain domestic concerns are
to remain under State industrial control, I am with the
Prime Minister, and am prepared to recommend my
colleagues to agree to the necessary reference resolution
for legislation, and to ask Parliament to indorse it.
Mr. MITCHELL. The Prime Minister said ho
agreed to that. But the difficulty would come about
in endeavouring to arrive at the line of demarcation.
The PRESIDEHT.—I think there ought to be no
difficulty in regard to that. There was a list of indus-
tries drawn up,which it was clearly fair to regard as
coming within the Federal jurisdiction. There are
others which are on the border line, and others which
may take on from time to time a greater Federal aspect.
But it ought to be possible to erect some independent
tribunal which could determine how the list of trades
and industries should be extended. That could be
done. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise ma-
chinery that will do that. Then, I take it, that the
subsequent clauses relating to industrial Boards, the
prevention of strikes, and the sanctioning of a basic
wage would relate to those industries which are handed
over to Federal control. The States would be left
with the responsibility of dealing with those trades
wffiich were not handed over, and in return it is ex-
pected that the Commonwealth would say that, outside
those industries which are to come under Federal juris-
diction, the States will have supreme control. That
would prevent overlapping. Otherwise, we do not
cure overlapping at all. Interpreted in that way, I
am in hearty sympathy with the recommendation of
the Prime Minister. I think that the States are quite
incapable, with their machinery, of dealing with cer-
tain disputes—not merely disputes which may extend
beyond the limits of one State, or those over which the
Commonwealth has jurisdiction now, but, for instance,
the coal dispute. The dispute affecting the coal in-
dustry in Hew South Wales could, undoubtedly, in my
opinion, be better handled by a Commonwealth tri-
bunal than by any State tribunal.
Mr. BAEWELL. Shall we not need to propose
amendments to this scheme?
The PRESIDEHT. —The Prime Minister has given
an interpretation of paragraph ( b ) of clause 2, which
limits it to some extent in the way I want. But I
want to get the limitation into the memorandum. Of
course, it is necessary to hear what our colleagues in
the other States have to say on the matter.
Mr. STOREY. —I listened with a good deal of plea-
sure to the Prime Minister’s statement, and I have
listened with a good deal of interest to the President
and the Premier of South Australia, who have ad-
dressed themselves to this question. I have been so
long associated with arbitration, and with industrial
difficulties before arbitration became the recognised in-
stitution in this country, that I sometimes despair of
anything being done of a character that is likely to
bring about the desired end. I have always been a
believer in arbitration. I have seen many strikes in
Hew South Wales, and I have read the details of ma'ny
strikes in Australia. I was associated with the Go-
vernment that first introduced arbitration in Australia.
I feel an immense amount of good has been done
through arbitration, and I am still a champion of it.
I have had some experience of strikes. I had twelve
weeks’ experience of a strike on one occasion, and I
have suffered with others on many occasions.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. Then you are becoming
case-hardened.
Mr. STOREY. —Having been trained as a mechanic
in the boiler trade, I may be said to be somewhat case-
hardened. But I think the remark applies to others
besides myself. It might be said to apply to Sir
Joseph Cook.
Mr. HUGHES. —Do you say Sir Joseph Cook is too
soft ?
Mr. STOREY. —Ho. I sometimes think he must
bo mighty good-tempered, because he has been your
colleague so long. Seriously, I despair of anything
being done here. Sir Joseph Cook and Mr. Hughes
will recollect that a Court was established in Hew
South Wales designed to bring about that sweet reason-
ableness we hear so much about, when warring factions
will sit down like long-lost brothers and discuss their
differences calmly and with an ease really amazing
under the circumstances. It would not act when tried
in Hew South Wales. We created the machinery, and
the two men who were appointed to preside in the
Court never had a job, because there was an absence of
the sweet reasonableness that was anticipated. The
parties would not come together, and in consequence of
that the See-O’Sullivan Government in 1902 created
what was known as an Industrial Arbitration Court.
That Court consisted of three members. The em-
ployees had one representative—the late Mr. Samuel
Smith; the employers one representative—the late M>.
Cruikshanks; and there wias an independent Judge—•
the late Mr. Justice Cohen. They did the initial work
of arbitration, and they did it well. The only reason


why the Court was a failure, if it was a failure at all,
was that the unions came into existence with such
rapidity, increased in number to such an extent, and
were all so anxious to obtain collective agreements,
that the Court found it impossible to deal with one-
tenth of the work. The unions became dissatisfied
after waiting two or three years to have their cases
heard, and the Court became discredited. Years after-
wards, when Mr. Wade became Premier, he introduced
the Wages Board system, on the lines of the Victorian
system. The Court never has done very much good
since then. There were disputes, dissatisfaction be-
came rampant, and the organizations became anxious
to resort to other methods. Strikes have been the re-
sult. Ever since that time we have had strikes, and
nobody knows better than the Prime Minister that
they have been due to the fact that the Federal autho-
rities have ever had a clutching hand reaching out to
cause trouble to the States. There was a little r ouble
over in the Balmain mine, where there are a couple
of hundred men employed. That mine is probably
unknown to the members of the Conference. We re-
cognised that the Federal Government wanted to deal
with strikes over in a little district like that, and that
it was utterly impossible for them to do so. The Prime
Minister knows that, if we expect a Federal Court to
hear of troubles in some remote part of Hew South
Wales, or any of the other States, it will be anxious
to do it. That has been our experience.
Mr. HUGHES.—This certainly has opened up quite
a new matter. I did not know about the Balmain
men going before the Commonwealth Arbitration
Court. I suppose their union affiliated with the coal
miners, who have a Federal organization, and got
before the Court in that way.
Mr. STOREY.—They did not get before the Court,
but there was anxiety to take cases of that sort before
the Court, and there were people who thought such
cases should go before the Court, and endeavoured to
have them brought before it. The position that ob-
tains now has been created because of certain legal
gentlemen who have expanded the rights of the Com-
monwealth Government, or the Commonwealth Par-
liament, under the Constitution. There was a time
when eminent lawyers in this country laid down very
clearly what, in their opinion, was the extent to which
the Federal Court could go in dealing with disputes in
Australia. Through the anxiety of the Federal Par-
liament to get hold of these matters, employees in in-
dustries that were local in character were allowed to
amalgamate with unions in other States and register
as Federal organizations. Then they appealed to the
Federal Court. Ho one can say that in the days when
that was first allowed there was any connexion between
a bootmaker in Western Australia and a bootmaker in
Hew South Wales. The bootmakers in Western Aus-
tralia could have struck till the crack of doom with-
out interfering with the bootmakers of Hew South
Wales. Because of the anxiety of the Federal Parlia-
ment to have control, they have allowed what I have
stated to take place. The Prime Minister now comes
along and says, “ Allow us to control certain indus-
tries.” I have looked through the different proposals
very often, and I think that we might very well limit
ourselves to the items that were mentioned in 1918.
The industries have been referred to by the Premier
of South Australia. The wharf labourers, shearers,
and coal miners iare included.
Mr. HUGHES.—We have jurisdiction over them
now. What want is to create a different kind of
Court to deal with them—a Court on which the States
will have representation. We want to get uniformity,
to prevent overlapping, and to create industrial awards
to deal 'with a multiplicity of cases, and you can say
the kind of dispute that is likely to affect those we
have jurisdiction over. In that regard I am quite
willing to be limited to those industries Mr. Harwell
read out.
Sir WALTER LEE.—-Would you accept those as a
limit ?
Mr. HUGHES.—As a limit for industries over
which the Industrial Boards should have jurisdiction.
We have jurisdiction over certain industries now. For
those I was suggesting a different kind of Court, in
which you would have representation.
Mr. HARWELL.—That does not overcome the diffi-
eulty. \ ..
Mr. HUGHES. —I say the whole thing is wrong,
but I am trying to meet you. As Attorney-General of
the Commonwealth, I feel myself in a very awkward
position. I cannot be expected to get up here and
censure the Court wlfich I am looked to to champion
and support. I do champion and support it, but I
say it is a danger to the Commonwealth to intrust the
whole of the industrial affairs of this great country to
it at a time when changes are occurring with such
rapidity that no man can say what will happen even
in seven days. It is a danger, but I propose to create
a Court in which the collective wisdom of the Indus-
trial Courts of Australia would be centred. If you
want to turn that down, turn it down.
Mr. STOREY.—So far as Hew South Wales is
concerned, we would have no hesitation in recommend-
ing that the powers you are seeking be conceded, but
I am not unmindful of the fact that trouble will be
caused by the overlapping that will take place. In
connexion with arbitration, the Prime Minister has
not been a pessimist, but an optimist. Ho one will
dispute the fact that the Prime Minister has always
been in favour of the settlement of disputes by arbitra-
tion. I also believe in that course. When the railway
employees had a grievance against the Commissioners
in 1917, I declined to support the strike, because I be-
lieved we had machinery for the adjustment of the dis-
pute. That does not alter the fact that a Court may
be created which will have the opposite effect to what
we desire. We have had Ministers who have been ap-
pointed as head of the Industrial Department, and they
act just in the same way as those appointed to control
the Lands Department. The first thing they do is to
have their picture placed on the wall of their room.,
and the next thing is to bring in an amending Bill
which causes still greater confusion in industrial af-
fairs. 1 have seen so much of this sort of thing that I
approach this question with some feeling of despair.
Members of this Conference have said that it is only
necessary to get together for a round-table conference
to adjust matters. That, however, is not by any means
an effective way of settling' a dispute.
Mr. HUGHES.—It is well known that difficulties
Mffiich could not be settled by the Courts have been
settled when those representing the various parties have
met around the table and have talked over the dispute.
Mr. STOREY.—The only reason why men who have
been on strike come together is that a position has been
created which renders it impossible to continue the
strike any longer.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Oh, no.
Mr. STOREY. —I repeat that, with all due respect
to Sir Walter Lee. I have been amongst workers all
my life, and have been mixed up with trade unions.
But, while I do not dispute the fact that others can say
the same thing, I have watched these things growing,
and the only cases in which a settlement has been
effected are those in which the unskilled and the semi-
skilled worker have had a large influence.
Mr. HUGHES. —You do not suggest that the un-
skilled and the semi-skilled worker strikes less fre-
quently than the skilled workers, do you? Eor every


strike amongst skilled men, there are ten amongst
the unskilled.
Mr. STOREY.—I do not quite believe that. In the
Prime Minister’s most vigorous days there was riot
likely to he peace anywhere unless he got what he
wanted. The Government of Hew South Wales will
be quite willing to approve of anything which will pro-
vide for the continuity of work and the prevention of
industrial disputes. I think I can assure the Prime
Minister that, so far as I am concerned, I will be
prepared to hand over the whole of this work to him,
and allow him to settle it as he thinks best.
Mr. HUGHES.—I do not know that that would he
the best thing for Australia.
Mr. STOREY.—I know the difficulties, and I do
not believe we are going in the right way just now.
Surely the Prime Minister does not assume that strikes
take place now because of dissatisfaction with employ-
ment, or some of the working conditions. The trouble
arises from the fact that the worker is dissatisfied with
the amount he has to pay for the necessaries of living
compared with the money at his disposal. In recent
years the strikes have been a protest against the high
cost of living.
Mr. HUGHES.— Is not the basic wage one of the
means of getting over that?
Mr. STOREY.—We were one of the first to start
that in Hew South Wales?
Mr. HUGHES.—And you have had strikes since?
Mr. STOREY.—Yes; and we are not likely to stop
them.
Mr. HUGHES.—There are certain elements in, the
union, and it does not matter what you do, they are
always out for a strike. We cannot do anything for
them. They, however, are not more than 5 or 10 per
cent, of the union.
Mr. STOREY.—I am not quite sure about that,
because we have had cases recently where a ballot has
been taken, and the voting has been overwhelmingly in
favour of the strike.
Mr. HUGHES.—There are ballots and ballots. I
remember a ballot in 1894 in which I was interested,
and no one was allowed to enter the room unless it was
known that he would vote the right way.
Mr. STOREY.—I think it would be very much better
to have two persons appointed by the Federal Govern-
ment to meet with representatives of the various States,
and for them to discuss this matter, which, after all, is
a very drastic proposal. There is no doubt that South
Australia and Western Australia have the right to be
considered, and so has Tasmania; but they are nor, much
affected with strikes.
Sir WALTER LEE.—We have better legislation.
Mr. STOREY.—That is not it. The people in Tas-
mania have never been taught the strength of the in-
dividual. They accept their point of view from the
employing classses.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I am basing my judgment on
the result of the Whitley scheme.
Mr. STOREY.—That may be all right; but I do not
want to discuss it. I have given a good deal of atten-
tion to the Whitley scheme.
Mr. LAHG.—Ho British worker will have it at any
price.
Mr. STOREY.—I am prepared, in a general way, to
accept this proposal.
Mr. EIHELLY.—I should like to have heard the
Prime Minister on the Surplus Revenue Act. Gene-
rally the pill is coated with sugar, and the sugar might
not oome along.
Mr. HUGHES.—I will deal with that later on.
Mr. EIHELLY.—One matter the Prime Minister
referred to was the congestion in the Commonwealth
Court, He can easily overcome that congestion by
appointing more Judges, and appointing them for life.
I do not think that the man who wears the wig and
gown is the only man who can deal with these matters.
The Commonwealth Government could pass an Act to
empower laymen to deal with industrial disputes.
Mr. HUGHES.—To the extent that we have that
power we can exercise it. I agree with you lhat the
layman often makes the better man.
Mr. EIHELLY.—The great object is to give the
working man the easiest facilities to get fair treatment
from the employer, and to adjust tbe difficulties that
always crop up. We have hardly had time to digest
the Prime Minister’s memorandum. Let us decide at
some future Conference what the powers are to be that
we should hand over to the Commonwealth Government.
Let us give the Commonwealth Court concurrent juris-
diction with our Courts. We should give full powers
to the Commonwealth on purely Federal matters and
concurrent jurisdiction over other matters.
Mr. HUGHES.—'That would go a long way, but I
do not think you could get your colleagues at this
Conference to agree to that.
Sir WALTER LEE.—That concurrent jurisdiction
would mean a continuation of the existing trouble.
Mr. EIHELLY.. —I do not think so. I think it
would be the nearest solution of the trouble. We should
try to prevent too many appeals. We should arrange
so that there should be only one appeal. There could
be an appeal from the State Court to the Federal
Court. The Prime Minister wants to establish a Com-
monwealth Industrial Court, with a roster of Common-
wealth and State Judges.
Mr. HUGHES.—Those paid by Queensland or Hew
South Wales could work with the Judges paid by the
Federal authority.
Mr. EIHELLY.—They would be paid as they are
now. The memorandum states—
To give the Court jurisdiction over so much of the industrial
field as will enable it to prevent and settle disputes —
(а) which extend to more than one State;
That can be safely agreed to, but it is spoiled by the
following:—
(б) which, while confined to one State, affect the whole
community.
It is not a well worked-out scheme. Then comes the
proposal—
To create Industrial Boards, whose functions shall extend
over the same part of the industrial field.
That only means further appeals. The employers and
employees never agree, though they may come to an
agreement after a strike has continued for some time.
Mr. BARWELL.—The settlement of every dispute
is the result of the two sides sitting around a table.
Mr. EIHELLY.—It may work out, and at all events
I have no objection to it.
Mr. STOREY.-—Most of the round-table conferences
have been brought about after one side or the other
has grown sick of the dispute.
• Mr. EIHELLY.—I admit that in such cases a round-
table conference may have some good result. Then
there is the proposal—
To provide for collective bargaining by industrial agree-
ments which bind both parties.
That is an excellent idea, but it must be approved by
the Court, and have all the weight and authority of
the Court to back it up. The sixth proposal is—
To prevent strikes—at least until after the procedure which
insures that the strike is the deliberate will of the majority,
after every effort at settlement has been exhausted.
I do not think that the law will prevent men from
striking. We have, the ballot in Queensland, but it
is a dead letter. The next proposal is—
To give effect to the basic wage.
I approve of that. I disagree only with the funda-
mentals, If the Prime Minister would inform us what


the particular powers should be, and what industries
should be covered or should come within the jurisdic-
tion of the Commonwealth Court, we could commence
bargaining straight away. We can sit round a table
ourselves, and bargain from there to see if we can
settle it. The other day the Prime Minister asked for
increased industrial powers for a short period.
Mr. HUGHES.—I did not say that. I said, “ per-
manently, if you will.”
Mr. FIHELLY.—It really did not matter at the
time. However, what we want is to avoid industrial
unrest, and to give a worker comfortable conditions,
so that he may rear a family properly. We want the
fewest possible strikes. My idea is that you should
indicate the powers which seem obviously yours.
After you have told us what they are, we could see, if
we agree, and if we do not, I would suggest that there
should be concurrent powers.
Mr. SCADDAY.—I want to admit at once that
neither the Premier of my State nor I have become
fully acquainted with the question of the industrial
powers proposed to be handed over to the Common-
wealth by the States, although it has been discussed
at previous Conferences. That may sound rather
peculiar to the Prime Minister, who knows that the
Premier of Western Australia recommended the people
to vote_ “ Yo ” at the recent referendum; but I think
I am justified in saying that that was due to what
may have been, after all, a misunderstanding, largely
brought about by the fact that the recommendations
of certain Committee that was formed in order to
finalize the matter, because of a certain disagreement
between the States representatives and the Common-
wealth representatives, were not included in the pro-
posals submitted to the people. Under the circum-
stances, we felt that we had not made any agreement,
and that we wer e not entitled to ask the people to
vote “Yes” until the Prime Minister met the wishes
of the State to the extent recommended by the Com-
mittee, which was appointed on his own recommenda-
tion. However, that is a matter of personal history.
If I may make a candid admission as to my own vote,
let me say that I voted “Yes.” To come to the main
question, it seems to me that we have always the fear
that some additional powers are going to lie given by
us to the Commonwealth, as though we were giving
them to somebody apart from ourselves. As a matter
of fact, the Commonwealth Government represent, in
a larger sphere, the same people whom we represent
in a smaller sphere; and in connexion with industrial
troubles, which bring in their train difficulties, not
only for citizens, but for both Commonwealth and
State Governments, I am not at all concerned as to
who exercises the powers, so long as we get better re-
sults than we are getting to-day. What I am con-
cerned about is to get a method by which the troubles
that arise from time to time may be prevented as far
as possible. I do not suggest for a moment that the
Prime Minister’s proposal will get over the difficulty.
I am certain that if every member of the Conference
were as confident as the Prime Minister that, with the
adoption of his proposals and the passing of the neces-
sary legislation, we were going to have no further
trouble
Mr. do not say that. I say that there
are certain reasons why the present state of affairs
ought not to be allowed to continue.
Mr. SC AD DAY.—That is true. I take the view
that it is better to do something, even if we fail, than
to do nothing, and allow the existing conditions to con-
tinue. The Premier of South Australia is concerned
with the constitutional aspect of the matter; but I do
not worry about that phase of it. What I am con-
cerned about is the improvement of conditions; and
if it involves tie tearing up of tie Constitution, in
order to get a new one, I shall not worry about tiat.
A great many people will imagine tiat tie handing
over of powers to tie Commonwealth by tie States
will mean something to tie detriment of those whom
they call “ we,” and something to tie advantage of
those whom they call “they”; and yet I cannot dis-
tinguish tie difference between tie two.
Mr. FIHEELY.—Does Queensland’s proposal meet
you ?
Mr. SCADDAY.—I have not heard anything defi-
nite from Queensland. Shall we arrive at any definite
conclusion here?
Mr. FIHELLY.—Of course, we shall not.
Mr. SC ADD AY.—I do not think we can; but I
think we can accept at this Conference a decision to
the effect that something has got to be done in order
to bring about better methods of settling industrial
disputes, or, if possible, methods that will prevent in-
dustrial disputes arising. Under existing conditions
everybody is keen that industrial disputes shall not
arise; but I do not think all the Arbitration Courts
or conciliatory methods will prevent them under exist-
ing conditions, for the reason that most people are
practising the very thing that they complain of. To
a great extent a man in business who complains about
his_ workers taking advantage of certain conditions
which arise in a moment, and enable them to bring
pressure to bear on him to obtain something that he
considers unfair, practises the same kind of thing him-
self. He does not lose a single chance of doing the
same thing with the rest of the community. When
there is a shortage of the commodity he has to sell, he
puts up the price which he charges the public. We
are all practising that sort of thing.
Mr. CAYY.—The employee has to ask.
Mr. SC ADD AY.—Yo one goes to prison in these
times for asking, and, as a matter of fact, the whole
process of arbitration is to ask the employee to make
his dissatisfaction known, if he is dissatisfied, and to
go to a Court that we provide for him for the purpose
of getting a settlement. But the difficulty that we
have experienced up to date is that we have had a
duplication of Courts and decisions. We have just
had a decision from the Federal Arbitration Court
affecting our timber workers, and I am expecting at
any moment to get a telegram saying that difficulties
have arisen through it, because the Court’s award gives
aerate far below the rates provided by our own Arbitra-
tion Court for similar work. While that sort of thing
prevails you will have unrest. Our State employees
draw attention to the fact that the Yew South Wales
Government have agreed to give some privilege or addi-
tional pay to their employees, and they demand simi-
lar conditions, or better. Then Yictorian State em-
ployees come along and draw attention to the same
thing. A good deal of our difficulty arises from the
fact that we are chopping against one another. If
we can get a system of arbitration that will give an
easy method to the employee to make his grievances
known,. and to get them redressed, and if we have a
clear line of demarcation as to the jurisdiction of the
Courts, then I am satisfied that we shall get nearer to
industrial peace than we are at the present time.
Anything is better than the existing condition of affairs.
One never knows when a few individuals may hold up
a _whole community; and with the present means at our
disposal, no one seems to have power to prevent disputes.
Some one referred to coal. That is a question the Com-
monwealth should control. It affects other States be-
sides Yew South Wales. A strike in Yew South Wales
would not necessarily affect Western Australia, and a
strike in Western Australia amongst coal miners would
only affect people of that State. Still, lam prepared


to give up our control over coal for the purpose of
bringing about industrial peace and protecting the
thousands of people who cannot he protected in any
other way except by Federal action. It is desirable
that the law authorities of the various States should
meet together and suggest a clear line of demarcation
as to what should be under exclusive Federal jurisdic-
tion and what should be exclusively State jurisdiction.
Arrangements should be made for the Attorneys-General
of the different States to meet together as soon as pos-
sible and make recommendations on this matter.
Mr. CAHH.—"What the States want is the classifica-
tion of disputes which should bo dealt with by the
Federal authority and those which should be dealt with
by the States. A list of industries was prepared in
1918, and it gave a very clear line of demarcation. !
presume the Prime Minister is familiar with the classi-
fication. It is one of which I approve. So far as the
congestion of business is concerned, I may inform the
Prime Minister that we are in just as bad a position
in Hew South Wales as in the Commonwealth Court.
With regard to the basic wage, the Board of Trade in
Hew South Wales has already fixed what is regarded as
a living wage. We have had an instance of the result
of that determination from the trouble which has taken
place in connexion with the carrying out of the work
on the River Murray. We see there the result of
the overlapping. We have a Board of Trade fixing
what is really a basic wage, and we have also a Com-
mission appointed by the Federal Government inquiring
into the same matter. The result must be confusing.
There is no doubt that employers and employees, par-
ticularly the former, want to know what jurisdiction
they are working under. If a union sees its way to get
a few shillings a week more by going from one Court
to another, it will do so. Take, for instance, the timber
workers of Hew South Wales. They registered under
the Commonwealth law; hut when the Board of Trade
increased wages in a certain direction, they at once
sought to come under State jurisdiction. The builders’
labourers acted in the same way; and all this is very
confusing to the employer. I am not averse to having
Federal and State Judges sitting together to determine
the conditions of certain industries; hut, at the same
time, we want a definite line of demarcation between
Federal and State authority. There are some indus-
tries, such as the sugar industry of Queensland, and pos-
sibly those in which shop assistants are engaged in the
various States, which are purely State in character.
I am of the opinion, and I think that most members of
this Conference will agree with me, that those par-
ticular callings can he dealt with much more expe-
ditiously and effectively by the State Court than by the
Federal Court. We have been considering the appoint-
ment of another Judge to relieve the congestion in Hew
South Wales, but we have postponed action until we
.see the outcome of this Conference. We do not know
what industries are to be dealt with exclusively by the
Federal Court and what will remain for the State. I
do not believe we shall ever do away with/strikes. Like
the poor, they will always he with us. It is no use
having a Court unless the workers can get to it qiuckly,
and have their grievances remedied without delay. I
believe in round-table conferences, because I am satis-
fied that a better settlement is obtained in that way,
generally speaking; and if agreements so arrived at
become awards of the Court, they are treated with more
respect than those which are obtained after being fought
out in the Court. If we are not prepared to adopt the
classification suggested in 1918, the matter might he
referred to the Inter-State Commission to determine
which matters should he under exclusive Federal juris-
diction and which under State jurisdiction.
Mr. HUGHES.—I put forward certain proposals,
not because they represented what I conceive to he all
that is desirable, but because the proposals submitted
to the Premiers’ Conference last year were rejected.
Even those proposals did not go so far as I wished. It
has been generally admitted to-day that much of the
trouble arises through overlapping and conflicting
awards. Mr. Cann and Mr. Scaddan emphasized the
fact that it is human nature to get Is. or Is. 6d. a day
more, and if this result can be obtained by going from
one Court to another, that course will be followed, just
as a man will always send his goods to the market
in which he will get the highest price. It is
not my suggestion, but if you had one authority,
clearly there would be no conflict. That is a complete
answer to the objections. You will not agree to that.
I put forward proposals which, though I do not pre-
tend to substantially settle the industrial question, would
tend to substantially improve the situation. You have
found fault with my proposals because they are not
complete, and because you say there is no clear lino
of demarcation between State and Federal control. That
arises from your objection to having one authority.
You overlook the overwhelming body of opinion in
the unions outside who have taken themselves out of
State jurisdiction to go to the Federal Court. Curiously
enough, Mr. Storey said that the interpretation of the
lawyers had widened our powers under section 51. The
opposite is true. Our powers have been so' much
whittled away that we do not know what power we have.
I say, first of all, that, while a round-table conference
is not a panacea, there is less time wasted in settling
disputes in that way than there is in a Court. The
employers and the employees understand what they are
talking about, hut the Courts know nothing whatever
of them. Here we have a Court. Eight-tenths of the
population of Australia have put themselves inside the
Federal jurisdiction. I offer you a Court on which
your Judges can sit, hut you reject that.
Mr. SC ADD AH.—-Ho, we agree to that.
HUGHES.—That will deal with all the dis-
putes over which we have jurisdiction now. I offer
that you should take your part as States through your
Judges; and in regard to other disputes which are likely
to affect you, I ask you to give us such an authority
as is set down. Paragraph ( b ) of the second of my pro-
posals states, “which, while confined to one State,
affects the whole community.” Coal comes under that.
The coal miners can do that. If there was a strike in
Hew South Wales of coal miners, it would affect Vic-
toria and South Australia, although the dispute might
be only in Hew South Wales. If the coal miners of
Hew South Wales want to get to the Federal Court, they
issue instructions to the miners in Victoria to come out.
Mr. SCADDAH.—We do not object to that proposal.
Mr. LAHG.—It might be any other product than
coal.
Mr. HUGHES.—If the bootmakers in Brisbane
strike, it does not matter to Victoria, yet they can go
before the Court because they have a Federal organiza-
tion. Let me take pottery work. Suppose the workers
in that trade in Victoria strike, that will not affect
Hew South Wales in the slightest degree. What lam
asking for is the creation of Boards and Councils in
order that we may have power to deal with these mat-
ters; but if you do not give us that power, we can
exercise it all the same. The only thing we are asking
for in which we want your assistance is in section 1.
That is the only thing you can give us, and I may add
sections 6,7, and 8. These are the only things you can
give us that we cannot take. We can appoint Boards
to deal with every dispute over which our Court has
jurisdiction. For an industry that does affect the
whole of Australia, such as coal, the alternative exists
at present.
Mr. LAHG. —You keep on mentioning coal, hut
there are other products.


Mr. HUGHES.—I came down to pots just now, and
yet you are not satisfied. This is a proposal that you
ought to assent to, and if you do not you will have cause
to regret it. I cannot, show you altogether why, but
any one who has given close attention to the present
and the past state of industrial affairs in Australia
knows perfectly well that danger exists. I ask you to
give us power to establish a Commonwealth Industrial
Court, with a roster of Commonwealth and State
Judges. We have a Commonwealth Court now that can
deal with pots or coal.
Mr. HARWELL.—The employees in any industry
can get before that Court.
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes.
Mr. BAR WELL.—We want to overcome that.
Mr. HUGHES.—That is in existence now. On that
Court, which any union can get before, I am offering
you the opportunity of having your Judges.
Mr. SCADDAY.—That does not get over our diffi-
culty.
Mr. HUGHES. —Yever mind your difficulty. We
will come to that later on.
Mr. HARWELL.—It does not prevent overlapping.
Mr. HUGHES.— Yea it does, because such a Court
is far less likely to come to decisions that will conflict
with the State awards. A Court composed of Com-
monwealth and State Judges would be far less likely
to come to a decision which is in conflict with State
awards than a Commonwealth Judge sitting alone.
Sir WALTER LEE.— You would still have two
awards.
Mr. HUGHES.—If you had two awards of the same
Court it would be just the same as having one.
Sir WALTER LEE. —They would be in conflict.
Mr. HUGHES.—How would they if they were the
same ?
Sir WALTER LEE.—I do not say that they would
be tbe same.
Mr. HUGHES.—Supposing I take a case in the
State of Tasmania, in which one of the industries can
get before the Federal. Court. Would you prefer that
case to be heard by a Commonwealth Judge sitting
alone or by a Commonwealth Judge sitting with a State
Judge of Tasmania?
Sir WALTER LEE.—That is not the question.
Mr. HUGHES.—But I ask you that.
Sir WALTER LEE.—It would he an advantage in
respect to that particular award, hut what would hap-
pen to the same industry covered by a Wages Board?
How can you guarantee that they will make the same
awards ?
Mr. HUGHES.—I am talking about this Court.
Sir WALTER LEE.—And I am talking about a
Wages Board operating in the same industry.
Mr. HUGHES.—Do you realize that, if you go into
the streets, nine out of ten unionists who pass you can
get into the Federal Court at present, and they can
please themselves wdiether they go to that Court or
yours, and they will go to whichever gives them the
highest rate? I say that there is a clear way out of
that, but you will not take it. It is to hand it all
over to one authority. Yon cannot take from the Com-
monwealth its existing power.
Mr. HARWELL— It was never contemplated by the
framers of the Constitution.
Mr. HUGHES. The unions demanded that it
should have that power, and I am suggesting that a
Commonwealth Court on which State Judges shall sit
will be far better for the industrial welfare of Aus-
tralia than a Court on which a Commonwealth Judge
sits alone. In regard to Industrial Boards and In-
dustrial Councils, we can appoint them without your
permission, and they will have jurisdiction over every
industry over which our Court has jurisdiction to-day.
We can appoint them without you. They will have
authority over exactly the same number of industries
as the Court presided over by Mr. Justice Higgins.
I ask that those Boards shall only have authority over
disputes that are likely to affect other States. You will
say, “ That is very wide.” Well, limit it by setting
out the industries which you and onr representatives,
after carefully discussing the matter, think are indus-
tries which in all the circumstances are likely to affect
the whole community. My friend, Mr. Lang, objects
to my saying “ coal.” Yery well, I will say ships,
wharfs, shearing. In those cases it is obvious.
There may be some on the list that you drew up
which should not be there. Ido not know. That
is a matter for discussion. If you do not give us the
power as set down we can take a still wider power,
but we cannot do anything to appoint State Judges
to tbe Commonwealth Court without your authority,
nor can we do anything to get a common rule, nor can
we do anything to give effect to a basic wage. Sup-
posing this Basie Wage Commission says that the basic
wage is x, and x is more than that which obtains in
Yew South Wales, what is the good of your saying
“ Yo?” It does not amount to a row of beans. Why
not give the power to one authority in this matter, and
have uniformity and order? We want a common rule,
and we want also to prevent strikes. Paragraph 6
indicates the way. Some of you gentlemen have said
that a.ballot is no good. Ido not agree with that at
all. My connexion with unions has been intimate.
I have not been a more politician outside. For nearly
a quarter of a century I have been an official of unions.
I have been connected with the most militant of unions
in Australia, and 1 have never known them to take a
ballot before a strike. Yow some of them are sug-
gesting that they should take a ballot. I assure you
that the ballot would not do any harm. You know
what it is—the moderate men never go to the meetings,
and if they do go to meetings they are howled down,
and never get a chance. Let them have a chance of
registering their votes before they enter on a strike.
In spite of what has been said about these round-table
conferences, I think they are excellent things, and
should not he disparaged. It is a good thing that the
parties should meet, and we have-all found by ex-
perience that when we have come to fix up with the
other side in politics we have not had the same idea
after working with them for years in Parliament as
we obtained by meeting outside. Let tbe men meet
face to face. I would suggest this: Mr. Scaddan has
put an idea forward that I am prepared to accept.
Let this betaken as a basis . Let the Attorneys-General
be asked to delimit this power under sub-paragraph (b)
of paragraph 2, which speaks of those disputes which
occur in one State, and may affect the whole com-
munity. Let them delimit it by setting out anything
they like, and then bring it up here. As for the rest;
if they have emendations to make with regard to other
proposals, let them make them, and we will consider
them. If yon agree to that Ido not think this dis-
cussion will he in vain. It is the intention of the
Commonwealth to introduce a measure quite shortly,
and I want to work in harmony with the States; and
in what better and what other way can I do so than
by bringing the matter before you? If, when I bring
the matter up, you simply tear it to pieces, and say you
will not have it— 'some, because it goes too far, and
some because it does not go far enough—how can we
get on ? Mr. Scaddan has reminded us that we are
the representatives of the same people. It
is the same dispute all the time. We
are dealing- with unions, with organized labour,
Believe me, they do not care two straws whether it is
the State or the Commonwealth that settles the dispute.
All they want is a fair deal,


Mr. FIHELLY.—They do care. One Court ia ac-
cessible and the other is not.
Mr. HUGHES.—A Court that is not accessible is no
good. As I said at the outset, my ideal of the machinery
for the settlement of disputes is that tribunal that was
appointed in the shipbuilding industry to settle disputes
as they arise. It does not cost the men a halfpenny. It
settles them on the same day as they arise, frequently.
It never takes more than a day or two. They have
already settled between fifty and sixty disputes. I sug-
gest that we should apply the same principle to those
industries over which we have jurisdiction. What 1 ask
is that you approve of the general principle; that you
say the present situation is not satisfactory, and that
you desire something which will prevent overlapping,
and which will give greater facilities to workmen for
the settlement of their disputes. You can refer the
matter to a committee of the Attomeys-General or their
technical advisers for consideration and report. The
scheme can afterwards be worked out in greater detail.
If you will go as far as I suggest, I shall be satisfied.
Mr. HARWELL.—May I point out the extent to
which the suggestion of the Prime Minister does not
meet the wishes of most of the States. It is this: The
Prime Minister says, delimit as regards clause 2 para-
graph ( b ). We say, delimit as regards paragraphs («)
and (6). That is to say, prepare your list of industries
over which the Commonwealth shall have full control
and regulation. Say exactly what they are, and leave
others to the Inter-State Commission to report upon.
Unless that is done, the Prime Minister’s suggestion
cannot meet with our approval. The proposal does not
overcome the overlapping.
Mr. HUGHES. —Then let the matter drop. We will
bring in our own legislation.
Sir WALTER LEE. —I hope that the Prime Minis-
ter will allow us to discuss this matter in such a frame
of mind that we may possibly arrive at some agreement.
There may be differences of opinion in regard to his
proposal, but I think we are all agreed as to the object
in view, which is to simplify the method of dealing with
industrial disputes. I have felt to-day that there was
a greater measure of unanimity in so far as the method
of procedure is concerned —a greater measure of
unanimity than we have ever been able to get to before.
But it does seem to me that there is some difference of
opinion as to the definition in the second clause of the
proposal; and in the explanation just made by the
Prime Minister the issue appears to have become a little
clouded. There are two things to be taken into con-
sideration, and they must be taken separately. The first
is the constitution of the Court. The proposal of the
Prime Minister is that, in addition to the Federal
Judge, there should be State Judges to assist him in.
carrying out the work. I take it that the object under-
lying that suggestion is to relieve the congestion of the
Court.
Mr. HUGHES. —It is not only that. It is to make
the Court more representative and more familiar with
the circumstances of industries in the various States,
and so to make the awards less likely to be in conflict
with State awards.
Sir WALTER LEE. —They would deal with the in-
dustries coming before the Court, and they would make
their awards. How we come to the sphere of opera-
tions of these Courts. Do we understand from the
Prime Minister that all those industries which are now
under the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, which, as
the. Prime Minister himself admits, have got there by
stretching the Constitution—that is, by the -artificial
making of an Inter-State dispute—will remain there, or
is it proposed that those disputes which are admittedly
of a purely domestic character will be given to the State
Courts to have jurisdiction over? Is it intended that
only those things, such as coal and shipping, which are
of a purely Inter-State character, will be left in a speci-
fied schedule under the control of the Federal Court?
Mr. HUGHES. —I stated quite clearly the position.
We have jurisdiction now over certain disputes, and we
exercise that jurisdiction through a certain Court. I
am asking you to agree to the appointment to that Court
of Federal and State Judges.
Sir WALTER LEE.—That does not affect the issue.
Mr. HUGHES. —It is the answer to your question.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Ho. What 1 aisk is, Are all
these industries whether they are of an Inter-State
character or of a purely State character, to be under
that Court? Is that your proposal?
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes, certainly.
Sir WALTER LEE. —Then I say, with all due de-
ference to the Prime Minister, that he is not meeting us
at all. We have allowed industrial disputes to come be-
fore the Court that were not originally intended to go
there. The Federal Court is called upon to deal with
industries it was never intended to deal with. We want
to come to the Commonwealth Government in a true
spirit of conciliation, and to say that, in our State
Courts, we will assist you in dealing with the same pro-
blem by taking a share of the work.
Mr. HUGHES.—There is no way to do what you
suggest except by a referendum of the people. There is
no way by which the power vested in the Commonwealth
can be taken away from it.
Sir WALTER' LEE.—If that is so, and lam not
going to dispute it —I thought the difficulty might be
overcome by legislation, but I may be wrong—then we
are simply beating the air. This is one of the many
things that will have to be dealt with by a Convention
to decide on an alteration of the Constitution, the people
being given an opportunity of saying whether the whole
of this industrial power shall be given to the Common-
wealth Court to deal with, or whether there shall be a
delimitation of the work, giving to the Federal
Court certain specified industries to have full
power over, and leaving the remainder to the States.
What is the position to-day? Let me say this to the
Prime Minister: You have all these industries, and
you may add to them interminably, but you are faced
with the fact that you cannot exercise the common
rule under the constitution of your Court to-day. You
can only apply the awards of the Court to those em-
ployers who are cited. We have already had illustra-
tions of this in connexion with the leather workers
and the carters and drivers. The leather workers went
before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and got
an award. In Tasmania, there was a Wages Board
award. I was immediately asked by the employers to
call the Wages Board together to level up the wages
paid by those employers not cited before the Federal
Court. That was required in order to prevent undue
competition. The same thing occurred in connexion
with the carters and drivers. In other words, the
State Board simply became a recording body to re-
gister what had been done by another Court. That
was necessary in order to bring about uniformity of
conditions in the little State of Tasmania. The posi-
tion is absolutely ridiculous. If we have got to the
stage when we are told by the Prime Minister —I ac-
cept his statement unreservedly —that the Constitu-
tion will not allow of any of these domestic industries
coming back to the State jurisdiction, I agree with Mr.
Barwell that we are only wasting time, because that is
the crux of the whole position. If those industries do
not go back to the State jurisdiction, then, notwith-
standing the fact that State Judges may be appointed
to assist the Federal Judges, the Federal Court will
still be congested, and the situation will not be relieved,
because there will .still be two awards applying to the
same industry. The Prime Minister stated that the


awards of the Federal Court would override State
awards. I want to point out to him that that is not
altogether correct. The latest decision is that, where
a State Board’s award is higher than the Federal
Court’s, the State Board’s award prevails.
Mr. HUGHES.—-I do not deny that at all.
Sir WALTER LEE.—For a long time the common
opinion was that it was not so, hut the latest decision
has shown that opinion to be incorrect, and the result
is that Mr. Justice Higgins, that great authority and
mighty power on industrial questions, has made the
confession that he finds himself almost at a dead-end
because of the competition between the two Courts,
one contending against the other. I do not wish to
be misunderstood. I appreciate the lengths to which
the Prime Minister has gone to meet us. He has gone
a long way to meet us, but I am convinced that we are
face to face wdth a constitutional difficulty, and my
opinion is that the problem oan only be solved by a
Convention dealing with the matter and putting it on
a more satisfactory basis than it is at the present time.
Mr. HUGHES.—As time presses, I think I had
better go on with the financial question.
The ACTING PRESIDENT (Mr. Mackinnon). —
Is this subject to be dropped altogether?
Mr. HUGHES.—Yes. The thing is dropped.
Mr. FIHELLY. —The Prime Minister will not ac-
cept all we are giving him.
Mr. HUGHES.—You are not giving me anything.
The position is exactly the same as at previous Con-
ferences. In whatever way I tried to meet you, it
was no good, and nothing was done.
On the motion of Mr. SCADDAN, the debate was
adjourned.
FINANCE.
Mr. HUGHES.—I propose to deal with the finan-
cial position under three heads. Later on, my right
honorable colleague, Sir Joseph Cook, will set out as
much regarding the financial position of the Common-
wealth as is relevant to the present discussion. I shall
confine myself to three points: (1) In relation to
borrowing, (2) in relation to collection of taxation, and
(3) in relation to per capita payments. I propose that
the Commonwealth should be the only borrower. It is
idle to shut one’s eyes to the position as it now exists.
Those avenues which were open to States and to Com-
monwealth alike before the war are now closed. Mem-
bers of the Conference know only too well the state in
which the world of finance finds itself as a result of
five years of war. Great Britain, to whom we were
wont to look for loan moneys, has had to bear an
enormous burden. I believe I am correct in stating
that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth and the Trea-
surer of at least one State—perhaps the Treasurers
of two States —are endeavouring officially to raise
money in London. At any rate, I know that one State
is endeavouring officially to raise money in London.
The Commonwealth is confronted with a debt of
£30,000,000 owed to the British Government. In ad-
dition to the loans-that are funded or otherwise pro-
vided for, it owes £40,000,000 for war expenditure.
This, of course, is a burden upon the taxpayers, and
the Commonwealth, as such, has to make provision to
meet it. In addition, we are faced with very heavy
expenditure for repatriation purposes. We have
pledged our credit to the States to the extent of very
many millions, and the estimated amount, originally
sufficiently large, has proved to be quite inadequate,
and it is increasing. We have to fulfil our promises
to the soldiers, and there are works of vital import-
ance to this country—some of them were touched on
yesterday—for which moneys must be found, if it is
at all possible, and there are others which the States
most earnestly desire to carry out for the development
of their great territories. Now, it goes without saying
that, in any market for money, under the conditions
which exist to-day, one borrower will fare better than
six or seven. We were asked yesterday whether we
would provide the States with the means for construct-
ing railways and carrying out other developmental
work, as well as provide additional money for the
Murray River scheme, and for carrying out the unifi-
cation of the railways. It is obvious that wo cannot
comply with these requests except by way of loan. The
money markets overseas are still disorganized, and it
will be essential for the Commonwealth to borrow a
great deal of money in Australia. It is most undesir-
able that there should be six or seven borrowers on the
local market at the same time, or, indeed, at any time.
There should be but, one borrower. During the pro-
gress of the war an arrangement was arrived at in this
direction, though one of the States was not a party to
it. I suggest now that we should make an arrange-
ment whereby, for a period of years, the Common-
wealth should be the only borrower, both for Australia
and the States, on the local market, as well as overseas.
The Commonwealth would obtain such moneys as were
needed for our mutual requirements, either by way of
local loans or from the markets overseas. That is the
first proposal I desire to make. The second proposal
is that there should be one tax gatherer for the direct
taxes of the Commonwealth and the States. Failing
an agreement on this point, there should be one
common return of assessment for Commonwealth and
State taxation, so that the taxpayer will have to fill
in only one form instead of several. This matter has
been discussed at some length at previous conferences.
I am not misinterpreting public opinion when I say
it is strongly in favour of the wiping out of the dupli-
cation of taxation forms. I shall not labour this ques-
tion. We know the matter was remitted to the Taxa-
tion Commissioners to draft a uniform assessment
paper, but they could not agree.
Mr. iSCADDAN.—You could not expect them to.
Mr. HUGHES.—No; after my experience here, I
will expect nothing. It is, however, very desirable,
and it ought to be carried out. My colleague (Sir
Joseph Cook) reminds me that providing one taxation
paper instead of two would involve little or no
economy, but it would do away with a great deal of
friction. I must remind you that the cost of the war
has been borne by the Commonwealth, and the Com-
monwealth taxpayers have had to provide the money.
The Commonwealth has raised an enormous amount
of money in order to defray the cost of the war. These
war obligations are a first charge upon us, and they
should be met. There must be economy of outlay, and
I suggest that there ought to be some unified control.
I have already suggested that there should be one bor-
rower, and that there should also be only one tax
gatherer. In dealing with the per capita payment, I
want to remind the members of this Conference that,
at the Conference held in 1919, Mr. "Watt, who was
present on behalf of the Commonwealth, put forward
a proposal which, in effect, was that the per capita
payment would diminish at the rate of 2s. 6d. per head
per annum, until a rate of 10s. was reached. A pay-
ment at the rate of 10s. per head per annum was to
continue for five years, and thereafter as decided.
When the Premiers met in November last, this matter
came up, as it has come up here. It was not relevant
to any subject then before the Conference, any more
than it is relevant to a discussion of any of the matters
before this Conference. It was a matter of consider-
able importance then, and it is of no less importance


now. I do not blame the Premiers for their anxiety
in this matter. On the 31st October last a letter was
sent to the Premier of Victoria as follows:
I desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 22nd
October regarding the per capita payment by the Common-
wealth to the States.
As you are aware, certain proposals were made by the Com-
monwealth Government at the Conference of Commonwealth
and State Ministers in January, 1919, but no agreement was
then reached. I now desire to inform you that the Common-
wealth is again considering the whole question in the light
of the proposition to call a statutory convention during next
year.
About the same time there was a conference between
Commonwealth and State representatives to discuss
the proposed alterations of the Constitution, in order
that the Commonwealth might have full power to deal
with profiteering and industrial unrest. A decision
was arrived at, and the Premiers bound themselves to
submit and recommend the agreement to their Govern-
ments for acceptance. One of the terms of the agree-
ment was that the powers, when given, should be limited
to a term, and that they should expire at the end of
this year unless a Convention was called to consider
amendments of the Constitution. An election was held,
and these amendments were put and defeated. I think
it was yesterday that Mr. Lawson, in speaking on this
matter, which arose incidentally, quoted from a speech
of mine, made, I think, at Prahran, in which I said
that, when dealing with the proposed amendments, some
opposition had also been expressed to the proposal be-
cause they made no provision regarding the per capita
payment to the States. I made that statement be-
cause Mr. Lawson had written to me asking me to state
definitely that the per capita payments would be con-
tinued until the Convention was held. I also said that,
until the Convention decided the matter, the per capita
payments would continue. Mr. Lawson seemed to be
under the impression yesterday that, because the Com-
monwealth Government intends to call a Convention,
the condition then set out still exists. It does not.
The Convention alluded to was a term of the bond.
The people turned these proposals down, and the Com-
monwealth is under no obligation to call a Convention.
The States did not grant the powers, and not one State
went out boldly and earnestly advocated them. Still, the
proposals were defeated by a very small handful. The
aggregate majority was not very much; and so I say
that the obligation of the Commonwealth to continue
the per capita payments if this had been granted is
gone. We are going to call a Convention, but that is
not the Convention referred to in the bond. We ap-
proach this question, therefore, on its merits. The
Commonwealth has offered to spend large sums of money
on the Murray waters scheme, and the great work of
making the railway gauge of Australia uniform. My
right honorable colleague informs me that he was pre-
pared to commit the Commonwealth to £4,800,000; but*
that proposal has been rejected.
Mr. EIHELLY.—Do you know that he proposes
that Queensland shall commit itself to the same amount
as the Commonwealth?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—That does not happen to be
correct in any way.
Mr. HUGHES.—-The Commonwealth has great obli-
gations. It is confronted with financial problems of
the first magnitude. It is responsible to tbe taxpayers
of the Commonwealth, that is, to every Australian citi-
zen over the age of 21 years. With all due respect
to the States, I venture to say that the people
of Australia expect us to have due regard to the
expenditure _ of the tremendous sums of money
we are raising. In all the circumstances, since the
money comes out of the pocket of the taxpayer, whether
in State or Commonwealth, I cannot see my way to
say that the per capita payment shall continue. We
shall hear all you have to say, but the position we take
up now is, in view of what has been said, and the atti-
tude of the States in regard to the referendum, and in
regard to the expenditure of public money, and the offer
by the Commonwealth to commit itself to an expendi-
ture of very many millions —£4,800,000 for the railway
way gauge, and one-quarter of the increased expendi-
ture on the Murray waters scheme, or not less than
£8,000,000 —that we cannot continue the per capita,
payment Notwithstanding the offer of the Common-
wealth to engage in the expenditure alluded to, we
can arrive at no sort of agreement. In all the circum-
stances, we must ask you to adjust your finances upon
the assumption that the per capita payment will bo
reduced as set out by Mr. Watt.
The PRESIDENT.—I wish to reply to some of the
statements by the Prime Minister. In regard to bor-
rowing, the State of Victoria would, I think, be
prepared to enter into any reasonable arrangement
to facilitate the obtaining of money for the necessary
public works, both of Commonwealth and State. We
have conversion loans on the other side. They were
exempted from the scope of a previous agreement,
and such exemption will have to be continued. I agree
with the main principle as to the control of borrowing
in order that we may systematize and secure the best
results. But, so far as the respective Governments
and Parliaments authorize the borrowing of money for
public works, we should be able to go on the market.
It is a question of method as to how the approach is
to be made to those who have the money to lend. If
it can be done with better effect by one controlling
authority, by making a bond of co-operation between
the Commonwealth and the State, I personally would
make no objection to any such arrangement. With
reference to the question of tax gathering and making
one return applicable to the Eederal taxpayer and the
State taxpayer, I might intimate to the Conference
that the State Government of Victoria is preparing a
Bill which it will submit next session to Parliament,
and which will render it possible to make our return
uniform with the Commonwealth return. As far as
Victoria is concerned, Victorian taxpayers will be able
to use the same return. There are one or two out-
standing points of difference. There is the question
of taxing at the source the dividends of companies, a
question in regard to which we have been unable to
arrive at agreement. We are in the position that six
States are adhering to the method which all taxation
authorities have followed, and the Commonwealth is
standing alone, taking up the attitude of the one jury-
man who never before encountered eleven such foolish
colleagues. If the Commonwealth really desires to get
co-operation, they should desire to meet us in that
respect.
Mr. HUGHES.—In what respect?
The PRESIDENT.—The taxation of dividends.
The Commonwealth taxes them in the hands of the
individual shareholders, but the States tax the divi-
dends in the hands of the company. The States have
adopted the method that all taxation authorities favour.
Those who departed from that method went back to
it. Yet the Commonwealth sets itself up as the only
one who knows what is the right method, and says,
“You six States must come in and adopt our method,
and we will talk about getting one collecting autho-
rity.” Now, we want to avoid this duplication in con-
nexion with returns, and at different times we have
shown a disposition to meet the Commonwealth in that
wa .y.’ we have been met in the same reciprocal
spirit. However, the State Government of Victoria,
in an endeavour to get into line with the Common-
wealth, is swallowing a lot of things in connexion with
details under the income tax law which will enable us


t°_ provide a uniform form of return. As I say, a
Bill is being prepared. There has been a Taxation
Officers Conference, and also a Parliamentary Drafts-
men’s Conference, and there is the position as far as
we are concerned. I can recommend that course to
my fellow we should endeavour to get
a uniform basis for the assessment, so that we can
arrive at a uniform return, and give the community
the undoubted relief that will follow from that. With
regard to the per capita payments, I would tell the
Prime Minister that this matter is vital to the States—
absolutely vital. The Commonwealth has said that it
has borne the cost of the war; but the cost of the war,
while falling primarily on the Commonwealth, has also
the States, and disarranged their finances too.
There is one as against six. If this reduction is
carried into effect it will adversely affect and disor-
ganize the finances of the six States. It is, as Mr.
Watt said, when he was Premier of Victoria, “a pro-
cess of financial strangulation.” If you cannot get
unification, and if you cannot get all the power you
want through constitutional amendment, with the in-
dorsement of the people, then, get it by crippling and
financially strangling the States. If this proposal is
persevered in by the Commonwealth, that will un-
doubtedly be the effect. If you want to kill the States,
persevere with this proposal; but if you want to honour
what I believe to be an agreement, a definite agreement
made with the people, not with any particular Pre-
mier, but with the people on the occasion of the last
elect’on, then I say that, until the Convention is held,
those payments should be continued. It is true I was
writing to the Prime Minister on the subject, and was
not getting very satisfactory replies, but I persevered
with the matter, and saw the Federal Treasurer in
regard to it, so that, before the electors were called
upon to vote, we should have an authoritative statement
from the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of the
position with regard to per capita payment, and we got
it. _ At Prahran, on the lYth November, 1919, the
Prime Minister stated—
Until the Convention decided the matter the per capita
payments would be -kept as they were. That was the position
with regard to the States. It was perfectly clear.
Mr. HUGHES. What Convention—the Convention
set out in the bond?
The PRESIDENT.—There was no bond.
Mr. .HUGHES.—Oh, yes, there was.
The PRESIDENT.—There is a very serious mis-
understanding in regard to that matter. The Premiers
met the Prime Minister, and they did not make any
hard and fast binding arrangement.
Mr. HUGHES. Do you say that lam bound while
you were free?
The PRESIDENT.—No, Ido not say so. Apart
from that, I regarded this as a declaration of govern-
ment policy to the electors, and I accepted it as such.
Mr. MlTCHELL.—Everybody did.
The PRESIDENT.— Those who voted for the Prime
Minister and the Prime Minister’s candidates accepted
it, and the party organizations were behind this pro-
position. If you can say that a definite declaration to
the people on a matter of vital concern to all the States
can be set aside because the people do not ratify pro-
posed alterations in the Constitution, then it seems that
you can say anything and do anything you choose after-
wards.
Mr. HUGHES.—It was not merely that, but Premiers
went out and recommended the people not to accept
them.
The PRESIDENT.—That may have been true of
some of the Premiers.
Mr. MITCHELL.—The proposals were not sub-
mitted to the Premiers.
The PRESIDENT.—There was a serious misunder-
standing as to the position of a certain legal Constitu-
tion Committee, and the authority vested in that Com-
mittee. As it was necessary to deal with certain
aspects of industrial unrest and with profiteering, the
Premiers were prepared to favorably consider with
their Cabinets a recommendation as to the transfer of
those powers to the Commonwealth pending the hold-
ing of the Convention. When the legal committee
met to deal with these amendments, there was an imme-
diate disagreement as to what the powers referred to
the committee were. We had a report that lesser
powers than were asked for by the Prime Minister
would be effective to deal with the two problems.
There is no doubt that, in the amendments which were
submitted to the people, the Prime Minister asked for
a greater endowment of power than was necessary to
effectuate those two purposes. A great deal of argu-
ment took place with regard to those magic words,
“ The aftermath of the war ”; but that was only intro-
duced very late, when we were breaking up,
as the minutes and records show. 'However, that
does not seem relevant to this particular discussion.
Apart from the question that there had been a declara-
tion of policy by the Prime Minister, I aslc the Prime
Minister and his colleagues, I ask the Acting Treasurer,
to consider what it means in regard to the development
of public works. Our burdens have increased tremen-
dously. The Commonwealth say that this is necessary
because of the extra burdens of the war. It is another
way of putting those war burdens, which should be
charged to the Federal Treasury, on to the States’
Treasurers; and we cannot stress too strongly our op-
position to those proposals, nor can we stress too
strongly upon the Prime Minister our earnest request
that until a Convention, subsequent to the matter having
been put to the people, have said what changes are to
take place in our Constitution, what added powers and
responsibilities and what increased expenditure are to
be given to the Commonwealth by reason of that con-
vention, the arrangement should remain as it is, thus
preserving to some extent the financial stability of the
respective States. I do most earnestly press this point
on the Prime Minister, and ask that he shall adhere to
the statement he made at Prahran on the date men-
tioned.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I want, before saying any-
thing about finances, to put right a misstatement made
with regard to the unification of the gauge. I was
• very much surprised to hear Mr. Fihelly interject that
Queensland proposes to pay as much as the Common-
wealth towards this scheme. I may tell the Confer-
ence what actually has taken place.
.Mr. FIHELLY.—I object, unless I have the right to
follow Sir Joseph Cook on this matter.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Mr. Fihelly is at liberty to
follow me any way he pleases, but I will not permit
him to make incorrect statements without replying to
him. As it is part of the general financial proposals
of the Commonwealth Government at the moment, I
do not see that what I have to say can be out of order in
a discussion on finance. However, it is for the Presi-
dent to settle the point.
The PRESIDENT.—I am sure we all want to hear
Sir Joseph Cook.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—The proposal we have made
to the Conference is based upon a report presented by


tiie Engineers-in-Chief of the Commonwealth and the
States seven years ago. The estimate of the expendi-
ture involved in carrying out the limited scheme dealt
with by the Commission is given as follows: —
Western Australia—New line, Fremantle to Kal- £2,777,000
goorlie
South Australia—New direct line, Adelaide to Port 1,170,000
Augusta
South Australia— Conversion of the 5 ft, 3 in. gauge 1,058,000
Victoria—Conversion of the 5 ft 3 in. gauge , . 6,117,000
New South Wales—Moama and Deniliquin line . . 120,000
Queensland and New South Wales connexions, 100 900,000
miles, rough estimate without survey
Total .. . . .. ■ . .£12,142,000
My advices to-day are that this same scheme would cost
£24,000,000. It is on that basis I made my proposition
this morning that the Commonwealth should stand in
and offer its quota for general costs. We worked out
the figures, both on a mileage basis and on a per capita
basis, and, strange to say, there was no great divergence
between the two. I should explain how we arrived at
the Commonwealth quota. It is more or less arbitrary.
We arrive at the average by dividing the total State
expenditures by five. It brings our quota out at
£4,800,000.
Mr. SC ADD AN.—And very generous, too, consider-
ing that you do not have the railways afterwards.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. —That is our proposed contri-
bution to the scheme, and I respectfully submit that it
is a very generous contribution, seeing that, in addition,
we find the whole of the money for the purpose of the
scheme. New South Wales would have to pay
£7,698,000, which would mean an interest and sinking
fund bill per annum of £423,000. Victoria would pay
£5,704,000, and its interest bill would be £313,000.
Queensland would pay £2,768,000, with an interest hill
of £152,000 per annum.
Mr. FIHELLY.—And we get seventy miles of rail-
ways for that.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I am not dealing with the
point of what Queensland will get. I am dealing with
Mr. Eihelly’s absolutely incorrect and misleading state-
ment, that Queensland would pay the same quota as
the Commonwealth, whereas the Commonwealth would
pay £4,800,000 and Queensland £2,768,000. South
Australia would pay £1,777,000, and would have an
interest bill of £97,000 a year. Western xkustralia
would pay £1,249,000, and its interest bill would be
£68,000. The Commonwealth’s interest bill would
amount to £264,000 a year. The simple problem, there-
fore, was whether it was worth the while of those
States to meet this yearly expenditure, set over against
the undoubted advantages which wquld accrue from the
unification of the gauge. The proposal in reply was
that the Commonwealth should bear half the cost, which
is altered in a spirit of great generosity to one-third.
There the matter remains. As we did not see our way
to accept this generous offer to pay one-third of the
total cost of unifying railways, which are not our own,
the position reverts to the demand of your Statej that,
before anything can be done in unifying the railway
gauge, (he Commonwealth must find half the total cost.
Mr. STOREY.—What would happen if the States
said, “We will not come to your assistance at all”?
Your Prime Minister has said a hundred times, and
it has been indorsed by the Federal Government, that
it is necessary that there should be one gauge for defence
purposes. If you carried out your obvious duty in
connexion with the defence of Australia, what would
be the position then?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I would suggest to Mr.
Storey that he should not raise that question.
Mr. SC ADD AN.—The people would say, “ Take the
existing railways.”
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—AII I have to say on that
score is that, if we have to do it—if we are driven to- it
—we shall do it; and Mr. Storey knows where the
resources are to meet the liability. I suggest that that
aspect of the matter be let alone for the moment. How,
with regard to one or two matters referred to by the
Prime Minister, and discussed by the President, I
should only like to say that it appears to me that, above
all else, we ought to take care at the present time and
in the immediate future not to mess the borrowing
market up. Remembering that in the next few years there
are loans amounting to £400,000,000 to be converted, it
seems .to me that there ought to be harmonization and
combination of effort, and I suggest that it would be all
the better if there were a single control exercised over
all the borrowings of Australia while those conversions
are taking place. Whatever else may be said about
the Commonwealth being the only borrower, it has struck
me that the Commonwealth appears to be the only
payer; and I speak here and now as a doughty upholder
of State rights. My colleagues know that I have fought
many battles for State rights in the Commonwealth Par-
liament, and have suffered politically and in every way
because of the fight I have always striven to put up for
reasonable State rights. When I come into this Con-
ference and hear the remarks of gentlemen from my
own State of New South Wales, and gentlemen from
Queensland, who have always been out to destroy the
States, and have found in me their toughest antagonist
in upholding the system of federation instead of the
central system that they advocate, it seems to me that
things are completely “ topsy-turvy.”
Mr. FIHELLY.—What has this to do with the finan-
cial question?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—It is the very essence of the
financial question.
Mr. FIHELLY.—You adapt yourself to eircum-
sttlHCGS.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. Certainly the honorable
member does. He is fighting for his State at the present
moment in a way that ill-accords with the programme
which was outlined the other day on behalf of the groat
body which he represents. I now come to the question
of having one collection of taxes. We are proposing to
appoint a Taxation Commissioner, with a view to dis-
cussing all the questions raised by the President, and t j
harmonizing the whole field of taxation as between the
Federal and the State Governments. I realize, as the
President does, the absurdity of having different stand-
ards, different methods, and different forms. All that
should come to an end, because it means endless irrita-
tion and friction. It means great cost, and it could
all be obviated, _ and it should be obviated at
the earliest possible moment. The furnishing by
the taxpayer of only one return will give you
very little financial relief. It will give the in-
dividual some relief, and from that point of view it
would be very desirable, but it does not make for any
economy in the collection of taxes. The position is
this: The Commonwealth has undertaken to collect the
whole of this direct taxation for one-third of what it is
costing to-day. That was the proposition made by Mr.
Watt at the last Conference, and it was turned down.
There was a counter proposal made by Victoria to col-
lect our taxation for us at half the present cost to us.
■There the matter rests. I hope something will be done
soon, and I think that it will have to be done soon, to
bring about a better state of affairs. I believe that, if
there is one thing that is irritating the people of the
Commonwealth at the present time, it is that they are
perpetually preparing income tax and other returns of
one kind and another for the Federal and the State
GoverrooA&tjs. Tk President has stated, and it has


been echoed by other delegates, that what the Common-
wealth is aiming at is a process of financial strangula-
tion of the States. I hope nothing of the kind is con-
templated. Certainly, I shall have nothing to do with
the strangulation of the States. I want to tell you what
the position of the Commonwealth is with regard to its
obligations, and to leave it to you to say whether the
Commonwealth can be as generous in its returns to the
States as it has been in times gone by. In the first
place, may I say that Mr. "Watt made a very generous
offer to you at the last Conference. He told you then
that the position would not get any better; and, believe
me, gentlemen, it will not. In the very nature of - things
it cannot get better for you, and I think you made a
very serious mistake in not closing with that offer at
that time.
Mr. MITCHELL. —You have some responsibility.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I know, and I only want to
put our responsibilities to-day as a reason for our atti-
tude and action. May I say something as to the course
of finance so far as concerns ordinary expenditures
during the ten years’ term now expired? I find that
during that time our Commonwealth increases roughly
amount to £5,500,000. lam leaving out loans for
works, and speaking of ordinary administration expen-
diture. There has been an increase in the ten years of
£5,500,000, and the chief item in that has been old-age
pensions. At the beginning of the period —l9lO-11
the amount expended in old-age pensions was £1,868,000.
This year we are spending £4,500,000 for the same pur-
pose. That accounts for a great portion of the in-
crease in our Commonwealth administration expendi-
ture. I apprehend that no one at this Conference will
say that we have been paying too much in pensions. We
have had to increase them 50 per cent., and they are
not extravagant to-day. That accounts for nearly the
whole of the increase of the expenditure of the Common-
wealth in connexion with nrffinajy .administration.
How do we stand to-day? I find that the States have
been spending freely during the war.
Mr. MITCHELL.—Hot as freely as the Common-
wealth.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—We will see about that. I
find that the increases in the revenue of the States
during the war amounted to 23 per cent. That is to
say, the States collected 23 per cent, more at the end
of the war than at the beginning. I have the details,
but I will just give the total figures. Before the war
the amount was £47,000,000, while at the close of the
war it was, roughly, £58,000,000.
Mr. SC ADD AH.—That may mean anything. There
may have been extra charges.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I am speaking of revenue.
Whilst the revenue of the States increased by 23 per
cent., that of the Commonwealth increased by 102
per cent. The point I want to make is that the Com-
monwealth obligations are piling up in consequence
of the war and make some agreement between the Com-
monwealth and the States absolutely necessary.
Mr. STOREY.—Your figures are entirely mislead-
ing.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—May I say this, that not-
withstanding the war the States have been launching
into all sorts of business enterprises, while the Com-
monwealth has not been able to do anything of the
kind. I should like to compare the ordinary adminis-
tration expenses of the States and the Commonwealth.
While the expenditure of the States has increased by
25 per cent., there has been an actual decrease in Com-
monwealth expenditure on ordinary services by
£277,000.
Mr. STOREY.—Your .figures are entirely mislead-
ing and not worth reading.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. —I am talking of expenditure,
pure and simple. Surely that is fair. I simply sug-
gest that your extension has been at the rate of 25 per
cent.
Mr. SC ADD AH. —It is very clever, but not correct
a ll Seims.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—-Permit me Ijo show you
what our own outlook is. This year we have this
state of affairs arising partly from the war. We have
to pay in interest and sinking fund on war loans no
less than £14,169,000. That is the bonded debt. We
have pensions amounting to £6,250,000. The reptria-
tion of soldiers out of revenue will involve an amount
of £2,640,000. The interest on our indebtedness to
the British Government for the maintenance of troops
for war purposes is £1,816,000, while other war ser-
vices amount to £357,000, so that the total expenditure
this year out of revenue will amount to £25,000,000.
Hext year the interest and sinking fund on war loans
will be £19,300,000; we expect the war pensions to
amount to £7,000,000, and the repatriation expenditure
from revenue £2,500,000, making a total of £29,000,000.
Whether we have reached the peak in this expenditure
I do not pretend to say. I should say that next year
will see us at the top. Whether there will be a de-
cline in pensions remains to be seen, but I do not think
there will be very much of ia decrease for some years,
during which we may look forward to a total war
charge of £29,000,000. We have been imposing taxa-
tion, and so have the States, and there seems to be a
competition in taxation to-day. Members of this Con-
ference have been speaking of a delimitation of spheres
in the industrial realm. Surely there should be a de-
limitation of spheres in regard to taxation, I agree
that the sooner the Convention can deal with all these
matters the better it will be for all concerned. We
cannot keep up this competition, and Hew South
Wales seems to be always getting in first. Since I
have been sitting at this table I have heard of another
proposal which will load us in a new direction, and
how much further we are going in this way I do not
know. I think the taxpayers will soon demand a de-
limitation of the taxation spheres of the Common-
wealth and the States.
Mr. SCADDAH.—The Convention will deal with
that.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I agree this is a matter for
the Convention, but it does not touch the difficulty in
which we find ourselves now.
The PRESIDEHT. —You will be at the apex of the
expenditure in connexion with war pensions next year,
and then it will be a declining quantity.
Sir JOSEPH COOK- —That remains to be seen.
The PRESIDEHT.—That is what you expect; and
as you decline in your expenditure, so you increase the
amount by which you reduce the per capita payments.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—We may reasonably look for
a continuation of the war pensions, especially when one
remembers that children are being born all the time to
returned soldiers. The decline may not be as rapid
as we should like it to be. lam under the impression
that in the United States the pensions were bigger
fifty years after the war than at the beginning. How-
ever, that is not likely to be our case. It does not re-
quire very much argument to convince you, who have
the interests of the States at heart, that we have a tre-
mendous financial problem to grapple with.
Mr. MITCHELL.—What was your surplus last
year?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.— ; About £3,000,000. I may
remark that it is being swallowed up. Amongst
the added items for this year we have £500,000 interest
on the gratuities, £1,500,000, at least, further interest
on war debt, and £1,250,000 more war pensions, on


account of the Bill put through the other day increas-
ing the war pensions to make them equal to those paid
in other countries. The Minister for Eepatriation
tells me that he expects that he will want, at least,
another £1,000,000 in revenue for general repatriation
purposes, vocational training, sustenance, and that
kind of thing. Then we have our old-age pensions,
which, owing to an increase of half-a-crown, will in-
volve another £750,000. Our Post Office has been
starved until it is quite inefficient. The savings that
we have made show that the total of our spending is
not less at the end of the war than it was at the be-
ginning, and that fact is largely responsible for the
starvation of our public works. We cannot go on much
longer in that way in the Post Office. We are look-
ing to a substantial increase in expenditure in the
Post Office to make it the efficient instrument that it
should he.
The PEESIDEHT. —The same thing is happening
in the States. We are starving public works.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—I know. I cheerfully agree
that Victoria has trimmed itself, just as I claim we
have done. We shall have an increase of seven or
eight millions sterling next year alone. That is in-
escapable, and most of it arises out of the war. What
are we to do? The Prime Minister has stated the
case, and I am giving the reasons why something must
be done to keep from you—and 1 say it with the
greatest reluctance—the sums we are now paying on
account of the surplus revenue.
Mr. SCADDAH.—Why was it not so urgent that
an alteration should have been made before?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—It is urgent because we have
to begin borrowing. Then there are large claims in
connexion with land settlement. I heard of one case
in which £3,000 was going to he paid for a block on
which one soldier was to be put. The cost is going up.
I do not know whether it arises from the fact that we
are displacing other settlers for soldiers, or from the
increased cost of land, but I know that the cost is
mounting up steadily. The outlook is set for more
taxation and more borrowing. The Treasurer is in
London now trying to get us out of some temporary
difficulties. :
Mr. SC ADD AH. —Has the position become so
serious since the statement was made by the Prime
Minister as a definite statement of politics?
Sir JOSEPH OOOK.—I do not know what was in
the Prime Minister’s mind then, but the position to-
day is serious from the Federal point of view. I have
explained why we must have a great deal more money
at the earliest possible moment.
The PEESIDEHT.—You have listened to the Prime
Minister’s statement, and to the supplementary state-
ment by Sir Joseph Cook; are you prepared to continue
the debate, or have you any motions to move?
Mr, EIHELLY.—I cannot let the question go with-
out entering an emphatic protest against the mean state-
ment made by the Commonwealth Ministry. It is
mean, mean in every way. Sir Joseph Cook has
criticised States’ finances and referred to our
expenditure. I would say to the Commonwealth
Ministry, you get your revenue so easily ami
so indirectly through the Tariff, almost without
offending any one, that you have been right through the
course of the last ten years indulging in an orgy of
extravagance. I say that designedly. Eight through,
the Commonwealth Government have been extravagant.
They were extravagant, for instance, in creating a police
force which was quite unnecessary. They were extra-
vagant before that in various undertakings. The Com-
monwealth Government are getting their revenue in a
simple way, and now they are trying to take money
away fronYthe States in a miean way. They will give
something to the Murray waters scheme, or to unify
the railways, but they will give nothing at all to help as
in Queensland to develop our country. Queensland has
an area of 670,500 square miles, with a population to
the square mile of only a little more than one person.
It has 5,469 miles of railway. We have to connect the
southern and the northern portions of Queensland. Wo
have a great responsibility, yet the portion due to us is
cut down. What for? I have never yet listened to
a* more wicked piece of sophistry. The Prime Minister
tells the Premiers of the different States that, had they
gone out on the hustings and supported seine proposals
regarding some other matter that did not touch upon
finance, they could have had something to-day. He has
mixed up two totally irrelevant matters —one concern-
ing industrial affairs, and one concerning finance, which
is of vital importance to the States. Has he no sense
of equity? Either it is a fair thing to continue the
subsidy to the States, or it is a fair thing to take it away
from them.
Mr. HUGHES. —Do you want equity, or do you
want the per capita grant?
Mr. EIHELLY.—We want equity, which means the
per capita grant. The Prime Minister, guiding the
destinies of the Commonwealth, tells a body of men.
who really are intrusted with important duties and
authority that, because they did not do something not
associated with finance in his way, they will get nothing.
Because they were not good boys—because the Premier
of Victoria did not speak in support of the referendum
until late, and because Mr. Mitchell was half-hearted
and turned against it—the States are not to get money.
In opening the Conference the Lieutenant-Governor of
Victoria made a few pointed remarks that were very
apt. I repeat that I am no “ States-righter.” I be-
lieve in giving the widest possible powers to the Federal
Government. I went through the Prime , Minister’s
proposals item by item to-day, and I told him that
everything relating to Federal matters he could have,
and that in connexion with everything not relating to
Federal matters we only wanted concurrent power with
him. Hothing could have been more generous. The
Lieutenant-Governor said—
There are two thoughts to which I may venture to give
expression which are quite beyond the field of controversial
politics, and which are, I think, suitable for an occasion when
there are gathered together distinguished men from the various
parts of Australia who are intrusted with the guidance of the
destinies of the States at this very critical time. The first is
that it should never be forgotten that, whatever changes there
may be in future in the Constitution of Australia, the States,
under our Constitution as it now stands, have within their own
territories and within the wide sphere of their own action in
legislation and administration, as high and independent sove-
reign authority as they had before Federation.
Of course, no one disputes that, though for a brief
moment the Prime Minister did to-day.
Mr. HUGHES.—Ho.
Mr. PIHELLY. —The Lieutenant-Governor con-
tinued —
That, I think, should never be forgotten. The other thought
that comes into my mind is this—that, if there is to be any
alteration in the Constitution of Australia, it is the desire,
I believe, of all of us that it should be brought about as the
result of the calm and, as far as humanly possible, well-formed
judgment of the people of Australia, and not by pressure of
financial or any other circumstances whatever.
I say that is a good sound gospel for Australia. The
Prime Minister is now attempting to strangle the States
because they would not agree to something that he put
to them. It is not merely intimidation; it is garrotting.
I now come to the extravagance of the Commonwealth.
In 1902-3 the total revenue of the Commonwealth was
less than £9,000,000. The revenue for 1919-20 was
estimated at £17,750,000. They still want their paltry
few pounds from Queensland, and they want also the
dole that Western Australia has been getting. Sir
J oseph Cook waxed emphatic about the extravagance of


the States Governments, and ho included in his revenue
and expenditure statements the railways, on which each
State is losing money, and where cost of material and
wages have increased by 80 per cent.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. —I did not say that.
Mr. FIHELLY.—The direct taxation of the Com-
monwealth has gone up from £1,370,000 to over
£16,000,000 in the course of a few years. That was not
for war purposes, but while they were “ Canberra-ing,”
and so forth. (Sir Joseph Cook’s speech on the ex-
travagance of the States would have been a good pre-
lude to the increase the Commonwealth people gave
themselves in the Commonwealth Parliament the
other night. I want to point out what the re-
duction outlined by Mr. Watt and the undertaking
given by Mr. Hughes would mean to the States. In
the first year, with the reduction of half-a-crown per
head, _ Queensland would receive just about £lOO,OOO
less; in the second year, with the reduction of ss. per
head, about £200,000 less; in the third vear, with the
reduction to 17s. 6d. per head, £301,000 less; in the
fourth year, £413,000 less; in the fifth year, £531,000
less; and in the last year, £650,000 less. Those figures
allow for the population increasing all the time, regard
having been had to our vital statistics. The loss to
Queensland would not mean so much as the loss to some
of the other States, though those States would lose less
in money. Still, that would be the sorry position we
should be in had the Prime Minister’s promise been
adhered to. That would have been the sorry position
we would be in had the Premiers gone out and sup-
ported his industrial proposals.
Mr. HUGHES.—You have neither understood what
the promise was, nor do you understand the present cir-
cumstances.
Mr. FIHELLY. —On this matter all the Premiers
seem to agree with me, at all events. Sir William
Irvine put the position well. If you cannot get us to
give you the powers you want, you will strangle us
financially. If you cannot take away what the Con-
stitution allows us, you will bleed us dry. First of all,
there was the precious proposal that the Commonwealth
should contribute one-sixth towards the cost of a uni-
form railway gauge, and that Queensland should also
contribute one-sixth and get 78 miles of railway built.
That is generosity. Then the Prime Minister says he
has no money to lend us. The very contract he entered
into with the State Premiers, guaranteeing them certain
loan moneys for a series of years, he broke. We had to
go on the London market. The Prime Minister could
not keep his own agreement entered into in set terms
drawn up by his own Crown Law officers. He had to
say, “We cannot give you some hundreds of thousands,
but we release you, and you can borrow the money else-
where.” In connexion with the gratuity bonds, the
same mean policy was expounded. He sent a wire to
our State on the even of the election, saying, “ The
banks have agreed to cash bonds and the employers have
agreed.” That meant bludgeoning us on the eve of the
election to promise money that we find it difficult to
get. Not merely that, but we were asked to undertake
to compel the previous employers of returned soldiers to
carry out their obligations.
Mr. HUGHES—You have no business, under cover
of this motion, to attack the Federal Government in
its own proper sphere of action.
Mr. LANG. —We have the right if you break your
word.
Mr. HUGHES.—I have not broken my word.
Mr. FIHELLY.—A remark like that of the Prime
Minister’s carries no weight with me.
Mr. HUGHES.—I ask you, Mr. President, not to
allow this debate to degenerate. Mr. Fihelly seems in-
clined to take advantage of it to attack the Common-
wealth policy qua policy.
Mr. FIHELLY. —If the Commonwealth policy is
going to result in' the Surplus Revenue Act disappear-
ing, and the deprivation of the States in other ways, I
think wo have the right to speak.
The PRESIDENT.—I think it would be better if we
were to confine ourselves to the matters strictly before
us.
Mr. FIHELLY.—We have the question of taxation
before us.
The PRESIDENT.—There are three questions in-
volving taxation, borrowing, and the per capita pay-
ments. I do not think we will help one another by call-
ing each othqr names.
Mr. EIIIELLY.—The Commonwealth graciously
asked Queensland to enter into an obligation to the ex-
tent of £2,250,000 for the purpose of constructing 78
miles of railway. l Surely other matters associated with
it are not quite irrelevant. I have already referred to
the uurealiableness of statements made by Common-
wealth Ministers, and have emphasized the position of
State Ministers in negotiating with the Commonwealth.
I have mentioned the compact for borrowing through
the Commonwealth, and how the Commonwealth broke
the understanding—they would not abide by the terms.
In regard to the collection of the taxes, Mr. Watt said
in May, 1918, that the Commonwealth could collect the
State taxes for about half what it cost the States. In
January, 1919, he said he could guarantee that the
actual cost would not exceed the present expenditure.
Later in the same month he said the Commonwealth
could collect the taxes for one-third of what it was cost-
ing the States to-day. First we have one-half, then
exactly the same amount, and finally one-third of the
cost.
Mr. HUGHES. —Do you mind stating what you
think my proposal is?
Mr. FIHELLY. — I. should like, you to tell me what
it is.
Mr. HUGHES.—The honorable gentleman is criti-
cising it without knowing the details.
Mr. FIHELLY. —You have told us that the per
capita payments are to finish.
Mr. HUGHES. —1 did not say anything of the sort.
The PRESIDENT.—What the Prime Minister said
was that he would carry out Mr. Watt’s proposal. That
is, that there would be a decrease of 2s. 6d. per head
per annum until the rate of 10s. was reached.
Mr. HUGHES. —That is a different thing from
finishing it off altogether.
Mr. FIHELLY.—That is very different from what
I understand, and several of my colleagues are of the
same opinion as I am.
Mr. HUGHES.—I thought I made it quite clear.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I am not going to bother with the
business much longer; but I am satisfied that members
sitting on this side of the table agree that the position
was not made clear.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—Oh, no.
Mr. FIHELLY. —My friends from New South Wales
and Western Australia are under the same impression
as myself.
Mr. HUGHES. —I said that, until the Convention
under the referendum proposals was held, the matter
was suspended; but the proposal is that there shall be
a reduction at the rate of 2s. 6d. per head per annum
until 10s. is reached, and that that rate of payment
should remain for five years.
Mr. FIHELLY.—I will not persist any further in the
matter, bull hope the Commonwealth Government will
change their mind and give the States a fair deal. The
per capita payment should not be interfered with in
any way whatsoever. It is low enough. We have
big obligations in the States. Take a scattered
State like Queensland. It is our duty to settle Queens-
land, and we are carrying out that responsibility fairly


well. During the last four years 50,000 of our pro-
ducers hare been away from Queensland, and it is easy
to understand how the absence of so many men will
affect the State. The northern part of Queensland is
practically isolated. We have had to pay £20,000 for
a steamer worth formerly about £6,000. We are losing
hundreds of pounds every month on this venture, and it
gives a very inadequate service. The northern part of
Queensland is in danger of becoming another Port Dar-
win, as Burketown and N orman ton are practically
isolated. During the cyclone season places like Mackay
are isolated, and we have lost £4,000 in a year in
sending flour—the barest of the necessities of life —to
that town. We had to increase the educational
vote by about £500,000 during the war, partly to give
the teachers a living wage, and partly to provide the
rudiments of education to the children of settlers in
the back-blocks. Sir Joseph Cook quoted figures to in-
dicate our extravagance; but the increase in our expen-
diture during the war period, included expenditure in
construction of railways. In this direction alone, in
order to pay the workers a living wage, there was a total
increase during the four years of about £1,500,000 in
wages. Our expenditure is continually increasing; we
are at the limit in regard to taxation. We could not
impose further taxation without threatening our indus-
tries, and we do not propose to do so. The Common-
wealth, however, are piling up taxation. Some years
ago they taxed Crown leaseholds, which means an
attack, not on the leaseholds, but on the rent to the
State of Queensland. This results in such a loss that,
as the leases fall in, it would be almost as profitable if
they were not renewed. Our charities approximately
cost £1,000,000 a year, which is a large sum for a
country with such ia small population. We have on
all isides an ever-increasing expenditure, with no pros-
pect of increasing revenue. The per capita payment
of 255. is low enough, and is a comparative trifle to the
Commonwealth. The proportion paid to Queensland
will help her materially, and I hope the Prime Min-
ister will change his mind on the question. I hope
that for some years at least the Commonwealth
Government will continue to pay the 255. It is badly
wanted by all the States, but by none more so than
Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and
Queensland. Victoria and Hew South Wales are not
so badly placed as the other States. The Common-
wealth Government have pretty well duplicated all the
sources of taxation. I can show how the Common-
wealth Government can get £200,000 in probate duties.
It is the case of an Australian who registered his busi-
ness in Hong-Kong. This was done to evade probate
and succession duties. He wished to escape legitimate
taxation in the country where he made his money.
We followed the matter up. Our share was £75,000,
the share of the Commonwealth would be £200,000, and
that of Hew South Wales about £150,000. It is only
right and just that the taxation should be paid. If the
Commonwealth Government got this source of re-
venue, it would help them for a while to delay the pro-
posal to reduce the per capita subsidy.
Sir ELLIOTT LEWIS.—I should like to put the
position of Tasmania in regard to the three proposi-
tions made by the Prime Minister in the order in
which he submitted them to the Conference. The
first proposition is as to the borrowing, and, speaking
generally, I will cheerfully accept the proposal of the
Commonwealth Government that they should be the
sole borrower, but with some minor reservations. I
do not think it would be wise for the Tasmanian Go-
vernment to' entirely abandon the arrangements they
have now for what we call taking money over the
counter. Many people find it a convenient mode of
investment, and it would not mean very much to the
Commonwealth. At the same time, it means a good
9618.—8
deal to a small State like ours. The other point is the
limitations that the Commonwealth will place upon
State borrowings. If we require to borrow money for
public works that are proceeding apace, there should
not be any unnecessary restrictions upon opportunities
of borrowing from the Commonwealth for that pur-
pose. We are embarking at the present time on very
large industrial undertakings, for which the State is
contracting to supply the power. The Prime Minister
at all times urges increased production, the introduc-
tion of new industries, and the more rapid develop-
ment of existing industries. We are trying to solve
the problem by encouraging industries to find a home
in Tasmania by supplying them with cheap power.
That cannot be done without considerable initial
capital expenditure. We are going ahead as rapidly
as we can with the development of our hydro-electric
scheme, and we should be very sorry indeed if the Com-
monwealth Government stepped in and said, “ You
have exhausted your borrowing powers, you must go
slow on all these new industries and these new de-
velopments.” We are, I believe, on the eve of very
important industrial work and development in Tas-
mania, and that requires considerable capital sums.
If the Commonwealth Government, of the
calls of the other States, should say, “ You cannot have
this,” we should be in a very parlous position, such as
no State should be placed in. We have listened to
what you have said, Mr. Prime Minister, at this Con-
ference, and to what your colleague has said; we have
heard the statements as to the amount of money that
the Commonwealth Government is going to contribute
to the Murray Waters scheme and to the unification of
the railway gauge, to both of which Tasmania will
have to contribute, while she will not receive a single
advantage from those works* We should, therefore,
receive special consideration, and when we come along
to ask the Commonwealth Government to borrow
money for our peculiar scheme we should not find our-
selves, as, unfortunately, we have too often found our-
selves, coming in as sixth best. As to the collection of
the taxation by one collector or the introduction of a
uniform return, I may say that this question has en-
gaged the attention of previous Conferences, and Con-
ferences of taxation officers, but no solution has yet
been arrived at. As you pointed out, Mr. President,
the difficulty we have had to face is the Eederal Com-
missioners’ taxation. All the State Commissioners
have met, and they have been unanimous in their de-
sire to have uniform returns. They are willing to have
a uniform tax collector if we can only get something
like uniformity in the mode of taxation. The Com-
monwealth Government have laid down a certain form of
levying taxation, which the State collectors have stated
has been tried in England and the United States and
been a failure in both places—that is, the taxation of
the individuals instead of at the source. In the matter
of their exemptions, the Commonwealth have many
which we cannot as States afford to allow* The Com-
monwealth allowed, and I think still allows, as a de-
duction all calls paid to mining companies. Many
wealthy people get off practically without any taxation
to the Commonwealth simply because they are pay-
ing calls to mining companies, which calls they are
allowed to deduct from their income—a principle
which is wholly wrong, but which the Commonwealth
will not depart from. In many other respects the
same thing is going on. If there was a little of the
spirit of give as well as take on the part of the Com-
monwealth Government, and also the Federal Commis-
sioner, who is, no doubt, guided if not directed by his
Ministers, there would be a greater possibility of solv-
ing this question, which should really be quite easy of
solution. When it is all give on the part of the States,
and all take on the part of the Commonwealth, then it


is very difficult to come to any agreement. As to the
per capita payments, I agree with you, Mr. President,
that what is proposed is going to lead to financial
strangulation, and I do not quite know how Tasmania
is going to struggle through unless some special con-
sideration is given to our State. If these proposals of
Mr, Watt are given effect to, and we do not have a
continuance of the special grant which has been made
to Tasmania, we shall lose from this source in six years
64 per cent, of the revenue which w© derived from it.
We cannot afford to make good that 64 per cent. We
have gone to the limit as far as taxation is concerned.
Our taxation amounts to £2 12s. 6d.. per head, while
the average in all the other States is only £1 19s. 9d.—
that is according to the figures for the last financial
year. We cannot increase our taxation, in view of the
heavy demands made on our taxpayers by the Common-
wealth. The Federal Government received from Tas-
mania £241,000 in direct taxation, and £544,000 in
Customs and Excise. They returned to us as a special
grant some £340,000, and so the gain from the taxpayers
of Tasmania is £445,000. Step by -step the Common-
wealth Government have encroached on all the powers
of State taxation, and in Tasmania, at any rate, it is
impossible to increase our taxation so -as to make good
the loss which we will suffer under the proposals first
put forward by Mr. Watt, and now repeated by the
Prime Minister. I cannot say how we shall get on in
Tasmania. lam sure of this, that there will have to
be some other Treasurer to carry on the work and to
solve the problem. It is one that I could not face, It
will be such a setback to us that we feel it very much.
Tasmania has been going ahead in a way it has never
progressed before, and to have a setback like this, and
crushing taxation imposed on our people, would be most
detrimental, and would frighten away the capital
which is floating in at the present time. Indeed, the
effects are really disastrous to contemplate.
Mr. STOEEY.—I do not approach the subject this
evening with anything like the enthusiasm with which
we have dealt with other subjects which have been dis-
cussed in the course of this Conference, and that is due
entirely to the fact that the Prime Minister put Sir
Joseph Cook up to say some nasty things which,
figuratively speaking, have knocked the stuffing out of
us. During the last two or three days, the Prime Min-
ister has spoken so enthusiastically about the whole of
the subjects we have been considering that in a moment
of weakness I was led to say that the honorable gentle-
man_ possessed some subtle means unknown to us of
obtaining money. I little dreamt that we were to be
the persons to be fleeced. I had not the remotest idea
of that. Certainly the honorable gentleman lulled me
into a sense of security on the different occasions on
which he addressed the Conference, and I think he did
so in the case of others, too. I had got myself to believe
that the Prime Minister had been working in concert
with Mr. Scaddan, and that Mr. Scaddan knew all
about it; but I am satisfied that this has beeu a rude
awakening for Mr. Scaddan as well as for myself. But
speaking seriously, I do want the Prime Minister to
thoroughly consider the position 'as far as the States
are concerned. There is nobody, lam sure, more seized
than I am -of the financial difficulties that the honor-
able gentleman finds himself in, and, may I say, the
Governments of the whole of the States as well. But
it does not seem to us to be of great value to take
revenue from the States so that the Government can
spend. In the States we have a thousand and one
things to find money for that the Commonwealth has
not, and every penny we spend means increasing the
wealth production of the country, and allowing the
Federal people to come along like vultures to a dying
sheep and take the money.
Mr. HUGHES.—You mean that we are parachutes
parasites I mean.
Mr. STOEEY.—You are both. This afternoon you
said you were not an optimist but a dyspeptic.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Do you so describe revenue
needed for soldiers and old-age pensions?
Mr. STOEEY.—I should not like to describe the
honorable gentleman for fear of breaking our friend*
ship, and if I allowed myself to enter on a dissertation
of what I consider the iniquities of the Federal Govern-
ment I should indeed have to talk to the Conference for
a long time.
The PEESIDEHT.—The States under these pro-
posals would lose more than £15,000,000 in six years.
Mr. STOEEY.—I have some figures on the matter,
and I ask the Federal Ministers to please not question
my mathematical accuracy. The table that I have here
will furnish an idea of how the reduction by 2s. 6d. each
year will affect New South Wales. I will quote figures
for 1920-1921 to 1929-1930. Hew South Wales will
lose the first year £232,000. That is not much, I ad-
mit, but added to the £500,000 in interest charges that
I guaranteed Hew South Wales would find for the pur-
pose of carrying on public works that have been men-
tioned, it will mean, for one year alone, that we shall
be £725,000 behind. I have agreed to the Hew South
Wales quota of £7,000,000 for the unification of the
railway gauge, and I think that my Cabinet will sup-
port me.
Mr. HUGHES.—If you can speak for the whole Con-
ference on that, I am willing to retire with my col-
leagues, and to return with an answer within five
minutes. If you are going on with public works that
will benefit the -States as much as the Commonwealth,
naturally my colleagues and I will be prepared to look
upon the matter in a different light.
Mr. STOEEY.—The second year, 1921-22, Hew
South Wales would lose £191,000; the third year,
£773,000; the fourth year, £1,068,000; the fifth year,
£1,377,000; the sixth year, £1,702,000; the seventh
year, £1,743,000; the eighth year, £1,787,000; the ninth
year, £1,832,000; and the last year, 1929-30, £1,877,000,
or a total loss to Hew South Wales, within a decade, of
£2,882,000.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Those figures are wrong.
Mr. STOEEY.—I claim that the figures are un-
challengable.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—The 2s. 6d. reduction is for
five years. You are taking it for ten years.
Mr. STOEEY.-—I want to show what would happen
by 1930. If, after five years, it is proposed to take the
lot from us, the figures will be double what I say. Our
difficulty would be only accentuated. How, take the
estimated loss to all the States. I will not trouble you
with the whole table, but will simply take the years
1920-21 and 1929-30. The estimated loss for 1920-21
is £672,000, and for 1929-30 it is £4,973,000. The
estimated loss by all States for the ten years 1920-21 to
1929-30 is £34,464,000. I beg that the whole matter
shall be reconsidered from the position of the various
States. The carrying out of the works that have been
outlined would involve Hew South Wales in tremendous
Interest charges, and for a quarter of a century there
would not be the semblance of an advantage. Yet, for
the purpose of the development of our country, we
would risk our political lives in recommending the
people to accept a burden of this description. I say,
because of that, we have a right to expect consideration
from the Federal Government. Of course, if there is
at the back of the minds of the Federal people, as some
folk have ventured to suggest, the hope that the States
will be swept away, that is another question. Many
suggestions have been made for meeting the taxation
that will be required. Ideas are as prolific as berries
in Hew South Wales, and we are receiving suggestions


every day a* to how we can arrange the general sys-
tem of taxation. I cannot say offhand what the New
South Wales people are prepared to do. We are pre-
pared to consider the whole situation, and if a satis-
factory arrangement can he come to we will agree with
it. With regard to loans, I do not know that there is
any distinct advantage to be gained by the Federal Go-
vernment arranging from one central point loans for
the purpose of developing our country.
The PRESIDENT.—-It would be a very good thing
if, between the States and the Commonwealth, we could
arrange the times of flotation. We do not want to spoil
the market.
Mr. HUGHES.—There should be one borrower, and
the six States should say how much they want. That
is one suggestion. Another suggestion is that the one
borrower should have some voice in the amount to be
borrowed. We are willing to consider this situation,
that there is one borrower, without reference to a
limited amount.
Mr. STOREY.-—The question of one borrower is a
very simple one if the Commonwealth will undertake,
on a State’s representation, to borrow for it. But the
Prime Minister will see that if the Commonwealth Go-
vernment determine, when going to the money market,
just what works shall be carried out, then if there
happens to be a Labour Government in power in New
South Wales whilst a National Government is control-
ling the destinies of the Commonwealth, and a National
Government is controlling the destinies of Victoria, the
effect on New South Wales may be very serious. New
South Wales might be in this position—that it would
not receive that consideration which in a country where
there is no such party Government it would receive.
Mr. HUGHES.—The best answer to that is that in
1915, when I was Prime Minister of a Labour Govern-
ment an arrangement for borrowing was entered into,
and the amounts were fixed irrespective of whether a
State Government was a Nationalist Government or
any other kind of Government. In 1917 or 1918, when
the arrangement was amended, there was a Nationalist
Government in New South Wales, and a Nationalist
Government in Victoria, but it did not alter the posi-
tion. I do not think there is anything in that point.
The PRESIDENT. —New South Wales stood out ot
that agreement.
Mr. HUGHES. —It is not a question of party. I
understand the President’s point. If the Commonwealth
says that it will borrow for the States, the amount the
States borrow must be determined by arrangement, as
it was under the agreement 1 have referred to. We
went and got the money to the best of our ability. I
do not, think anybody was any worse off that way.
Mr. STOREY,- —The Prime Minister knows as well
as I do that neither a Labour Government, nor a
Nationalist Government for that matter, would ap-
proach these matters as though there were no parties
in existence. The idea that there are no divisions and
factions which gets into our heads when we are in posi-
tions of political or social security is all a snare. The
Prime Minister knows that thp line is drawn particu-
larly fine in that direction, and no one knows better than
he the feeling that has prevailed in this country for the
last six years, I have been described all over the
country as being worse than a Bolshevik or an
anarchist, and it was said just before the last election
that if I were returned to power that there would be
an anarchist in charge of New South Wales. Well, the
anarchist is there, and while he is there he is prepared
to do the beat he can for those he represents, and he
will not do the things that it was alleged he would do,
sometimes by the honorable gentleman himself.
Mr. HUGHES.—I never said one word against you
in my life.
Mr. STOREY.—You never mentioned me per-
sonally.
Mr. HUGHES.—I made a very clear distinction.
There are two sections in the Labour party, and there
is a gulf between them as wide as there is between
heaven and hell.
Mr. STOREY.—That is beside the question we are
discussing. We have to approach the question of allow-
ing the Commonwealth Government to do our borrow-
ing for us with some amount of diffidence. Mr. Holman
had that diffidence, and I share it. (So far as borrowing
is concerned, as a matter of fact we did as well as any
of the other States. I have a table here which shows
that the Commonwealth Government did not even ap-
proach what it had promised in the matter; but I know
that New South Wales did what it wanted in the way of
obtaining money from other parts of the world, and did
it better than any other part of Australia. We were
able to obtain from the English money market approxi-
mately £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 a year, and New South
Wales is reaping the benefit of that. Those loans have
made it possible for the Prime Minister to do what
he will do directly'— to come along with increased
taxation for the purpose of balancing the Common-
wealth accounts. We have a right to ask the
honorable gentleman and his colleagues to re-
consider their determination. If they do not
we shall be very considerably behind in our ao-
counts. Possibly we shall have to increase taxation by
a very large amount, which will make it impossible for
the honorable gentleman to do very much in that direc-
tion without crippling the Commonwealth in the pro-
cess. If the various States have to increase taxation,
their legitimate excuse for doing it will be that the
Commonwealth is paralyzing them financially, and that
they must get in before the Commonwealth. That will
make it very difficult indeed for the Commonwealth to
increase taxation. I did not know that this matter wag
coming on to-night. Like Mr. Fihelly, I was net pre-
pared for it, but if I could tabulate the figures and put
them in chronological order, the information with which
I could furnish the Prime Minister would amaze him.
The figures I have I submit to the Prime Minister,
and invite him to give them his serious consideration.
It is no use his asking me to help in the projects he has
suggested if it means that I must raise another
£1,000,000 by taxation. If Ido that it will mean that
he will be impeded and hindered when he goes before
the people for the purpose of obtaining money. This
financial year the position of the Commonwealth is very
nearly as had as that of New South Wales. That State
is in a pretty had way, and the Commonwealth appears
to be in a bad way too. You have to balance your a<v
counts; you cannot have deficits every year without
making them up in some way. My colleagues and I are
new to our positions, and we feel the situation keenly.
We shall feel it more keenly if we have to start off by
imposing additional taxation, which we shall have to
tell the people was necessitated by the action of the
Commonwealth.
Mr. MITCHELL. —I was somewhat staggered by
tbe proposals submitted by the Prime Minister. In re-
gard to borrowing, tbe matter is very simple. It would
be very much better that there should be one borrowing
authority, and if that were all it would be a very simple
matter. If the Prime Minister proposed to act as agent
for the States, and to do what the States asked him to
do, I, for one, would agree. Our State wijl be a mode-
rate borrower for tbe next year or two. Just recently
we raised a loan in London on very favourable terms.
Our credit is very good there, and we can raise the
mpney we need. About that I have no doubt at all. If
a safe and satisfactory arrangement for the States can
be agreed upon, I shall he very glad; but I want to say
that the money we need we must ham I know there


are times when money has to be borrowed. The money
for the settlement of soldiers has been borrowed by the
States from the Commonwealth. Ido not know that
the old arrangement under which the Commonwealth
raised our loans was quite satisfactory, but still there
was not much to object to in the wiay the matter was
carried out. The question of collecting the taxes by
one authority has been talked of for years. There is
no doubt there should be one return and one collecting
authority. The States should determine what their
taxes are to be, and the Commonwealth could impose
their 'own taxation. If the Commonwealth will trust
the collection of the taxes to the States it will he a
simple matter. There is no doubt the people ought
to be relieved as far as they can be of unnecessary
bother and irritation in the assessment and collection
of taxes. The time has come when we should do more
than talk about it. lam rather surprised at the pro-
posal by Mr. Hughes jn regard to the per capita pay-
ment. While lam not prepared to say, after my last
interview with Mr. Watt, that nothing was to be done
until after the Convention was held, my impression
was that that was the position. Mr. Hughes also sug-
gested the wiping out of the contributions from Cus-
toms and Excise. He seemed to regard it as a simple
matter. It is, however, an important matter in the
development of Australia. The States have the full
responsibility of developing Australia, and without
this development taxation could not be increased. I
believe that the burden of taxation is quite sufficient
already, and if more revenue is to be obtained from
this source there must be an increase in production.
The Prime Minister ought to have some regard for
the responsibility of the States in this connexion. We
have to spend money in education, in police protection,
in looking after the health of our people, and in chari-
ties, almost all of which is non-revenue producing. In
spite of this fact, Mr. Hughes tells us that the sum of
£556,000 that was paid to Western Australia last year
is to be gradually wiped out. What does he expect us
to_ do if this money is taken from us? We must be left
with sufficient revenue to carry on, and it is reasonable
that we should have at least 255. per capita. Mr.
Hughes asks us to go in for a scheme of immi-
gration, and we have decided that it is a good
thing. We want more people, and we must accept
a considerable responsibility in regard to them. They
will be an advantage to the Commonwealth, though for
some time their principal contribution to the revenue
of the Commonwealth will be through Customs and
Excise. Are the Commonwealth to get all the benefit
of this increased population? In addition to the per
capita payment, Western Australia got a special al-
lowance of £250,000 a year. That amount is reduced
by £IO,OOO each year, and this year we shall receive
£150,000. We are entitled to that payment because
our contribution in Customs and Excise is heavier
than most of the States, and because it was recog-
nised years ago that our needs are greater. We go-
vern a third of the Commonwealth, and as population
H Scattered, the cost of government is proportionately
higher than in the more populous States. We get a
considerable portion of our supplies from the eastern
States, _ and while Western Australia pays the duty,
Victoria and Hew South Wales are credited with it.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Your extra taxation is least
of all.
Mr. MITCHELL.—What has that to do with you,
sir?
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Nothing at all. I am
merely mentioning the fact.
Mr, MITCHELL.—If our taxation is low, we pay
a considerable amount through Customs and Excise.
We are hot like our friends in South Australia, non-
smokers and total abstainers. I should like the Com-
monwealth Government to understand what it will
mean to the States if these payments are reduced, as
Mr. Hughes suggests. I should like Sir Joseph Cook
to say whether he intends to stop the special grant
straightway.
Sir JOSEPH COOK. —Personally, I should be in-
clined to taper it.
Mr. MITCHELL.—I should say that it ought to
stand at the present amount for all time. The Prime
Minister and Sir Joseph Cook say that, because of the
war, the Federal Government must have more money.
Ever since Federation has been established the Go-
vernment have been wanting more money. An emi-
nent South Australian, the late Sir Frederick Holder,
said that the cost of the Federal Government would be
£1,260,000 a year. That statement was contained in
a printed paper. There has been an increase almost
every year until now the cost runs into millions, and
it will go on increasing. I know of no Government
that is not able to spend all the money it can get, and
if the Federal Government had every penny raised by
the people, it would find a means of spending it.
I understand that every one here realizes what this pro-
posal means to the people of Western Australia. I
must enter an emphatic protest against it, and I hope
the people of Australia will do so. The Act requires
that the Federal Parliament shall agree before this pro-
posal can he put into operation. I hope the members
of the Federal Parliament will show a little more con-
sideration for the needs of the States than the Federal
Ministers are doing. If the Federal members do not,
I promise them a pretty lively time at the hands of the
people. The members of the Federal Parliament ought
to know what their duty is. I warn Mr. Hughes that
his very keen desire for development and for an active
immigration policy will be thwarted if he stands up to
this proposal. Mr. Hughes states that the Premiers
promised to support certain referendum proposals, and
that in return he promised a Convention. He said
that the Premiers broke that promise. So far as I
know, the proposals the Premiers dealt with were not
the same as those referred to by the Prime Minister.
How can a bargain be made in return for certain
powers given to the Commonwealth to deal with pro-
fiteering and industrial unrest? I advised the people
in our State to vote against the referendum proposals,
but I want the Convention. I believe that Mr. Watt
made a promise on behalf of the Commonwealth Go-
vernment that a Convention would be held. This
matter of finance could be properly dealt with by the
Convention. _ It is a matter that should be dealt with
after due notice. We have had no notice, and the Com-
monwealth Government have sprung the matter upon
us. If we had had notice, we would have come hero
prepared to deal with it, and I venture to say, Mr.
President, that you would have made it the first busi-
ness of the Conference. There are many things that
ought to be adjusted. There are duplications in con-
nexion with taxation and in other directions, such as
the Savings Banks, all of which should be considered.
I hope that the Prime Minister will withdraw his pro-
posals now and submit them to the Convention. I am
favorable to the proposition put forward for the unifi-
cation of the railway gauge between the capitals of
Australia. I shall be glad to support it, and to recom-
mend it to our Parliament. I have no doubt that the
other Premiers here will he willing to submit the offer
of Sir Joseph Cook to their respective Governments.
I doubt if the Prime Minister realizes how important
this revenue is to the States, and all that we have to
do with the money at our disposal. He has used every
avenue of taxation possible. I know the effect that this
proposal will have on Western Australia. I again press


on the Prime Minister the seriousness of this proposal.
I think we are entitled to ask that it be submitted to the
Convention.
Mr. EITCHIE.—I may say, with regard to borrow-
ing, that the system adopted during the currency of the
war, that the Commonwealth Government should bor-
row for all the States, worked very satisfactorily with
one exception, namely, that on one or two occasions we
thought that the Commonwealth Government paid more
for loans in England than the States would have had to
pay. All the States, with the exception of New South
Wales, came in at that time. If that system were
adopted now, it would not prevent the States from bor-
rowing locally by using State bonds. If that is so,
I think the States will do well to adopt the system.
The PRESIDENT.—There is no wish to interfere
with the borrowing over the counter.
Mr. HUGHES.—We did not interfere with that at
all.
Mr. RITCHIE.—In regard to the method of collect-
ing taxation, it is unfortunate that the States and the
Commonwealth Government are overlapping. Instead
of having two departments, two overhead charges, and
office and other expenses, if a system could be devised
by which the whole of the collecting of the taxes could
be done by one Department, it would be of very great
advantage. The Commonwealth Government not only
overlap in this respect, but in South Australia, within
the last few months, they have established a Works and
Buildings Department that will run them into thou-
sands of pounds a year.
Mr. GROOM.—That is not a correct description of
the position.
Mr. RITCHIE.—I differ from you.
Mr. GROOM.—The reverse has been our experience
in other States.
Mr. RITCHIE.—During the last three years the cost
under South Australian control has been £SOO per
annum. It is now proposed to establish there a local
branch of the Federal Department, the officer in charge
of which will alone receive more than that amount.
Although the work has been effectively done by South
Australia the Commonwealth now comes in and over-
laps in this way. While work for the State of a similar
character may be going on in one of our country towns,
and a staff of men may be engaged renovating public
buildings, it may be necessary under the proposed
arrangement to have a separate staff for work required
by the Commonwealth. In all probability there will be
two overseers, two staffs of men, and two sets of plant
engaged on identical work. It is not to the advantage of
either the Commonwealth or the State that overlapping
of that description should take place. Just now the
Prime Minister said that, if the States were agreeable
to accept Sir Joseph Cook’s proposal with regard to
the break of gauge, he would consider the continuance
of the per capita payments under the present system. If
the States fall into line and agree to that, I should like
to ask the Prime Minister how long he proposes the
present per capita payments should continue.
Mr. HUGHES. —I will answer all those things later.
Mr. RITCHIE.—If I spoke all night I could not put
the position with regard to the per capita payments as
clearly and concisely as the President, who I consider
made a splendid speech. With other speakers he
stressed what it will mean to the States if this money is
gradually retained by the Federal Government. The
late Premier and Treasurer of South Australia dis-
tinctly understood that there was in existence an agree-
ment whereby the present payment would not be dis-
turbed until the Convention met. That was his opinion,
and he spoke of it more than once. If the Federal Go-
vernment do what they say, and retain these per capita
payments, it will be in a measure taking the revenue of
the States to pay war expenses, thus passing part of the
responsibility on to the States. Should the proposed
system be adopted, the finances of the States will be
thrown into a chaotic condition. The annual reduction
of 2s. 6d. would make it necessary for the States to
amend their taxation proposals every year. That would
place every State Government and every State Trea-
surer in a very awkward position. As the effect of the
reductions on the finances of the other States has been
given, I should like to put the position for South Aus-
tralia. For the financial year 1920-21, when the first
reduction of 2s. 6d. would take place, the loss to South
Australia and the gain to the Commonwealth on the
basis of the population estimates made by the Federal
Statistician would.be £60,365; in 1921-22 it would be
£124,000; in 1922-23 it would be £191,000; in 1923-24,
£262,000; in 1924-25 nearly £338,000; and in the last
year in which the 2s. 6d. reduction would be made, 1925-
26, it would be approximately £417,000. That repre-
sents a total loss to South Australia during the five years
of progressive diminution of approximately £1,393,000,
and for the balance of the ten years it would be
£1,777,000, or a total loss of approximately £3,170,000.
Of course, that reduction would mean a corresponding
gain to the Commonwealth. Our taxation is practically
up to the limit. A similar statement has been made in
respect to each of the other States. Per head of the
population, our taxation amounts to £2 13s. 3d. That
is fairly heavy taxation. Practically South Australia
has only one industry. We have to depend almost en-
tirely on primary production. Other States are more
fortunately situated. They have mineral as well as
manufacturing industries, which we are not able to
advance on account of oilr not having the coal. Of
course, it must be admitted that primary production
is the best industry that any country can have, because,
for every bag of wheat or bale of wool which is ob-
tained one year, another can be got the following season.
I should like to point out to the Prime Minister that,
as a result of the Government workers’ tribunal which
we appointed in South Australia, we are faced at the
present time with an additional expenditure of between
£300,000 and £400,000 in increased wages. That has all
come into effect practically during the last twelve
months. Then, like every other State, no doubt, we are
very desirous of extending our education system. It is
being done with borrowed money, but we have to meet
the interest on the loans. In addition, we wish to carry
on our policy of general development. If we are de-
prived of these per capita payments, our development
will be seriously hampered in every possible way. The
fact should not he overlooked that we are assisting the
Commonwealth in a very important direction. I refer
to soldier settlement. That is practically a Federal
function. The Federal Government say that the money
will be returned to us. I only wish that I could believe
that all that money will be returned. In South Aus-
tralia I think if we get off with a loss of several mil-
lions, we shall do very well. That is a loss which we
have to face. It may not be by immediate taxation,
but it will come sooner or later, and probably much
sooner than later. Sir Joseph Cook says that he has
big responsibilities to meet. So have the States. The
proposal of the Federal Treasurer is to meet his re-
sponsibilities by impoverishing the States. I hope
that the Prime Minister will see the wisdom of con-
tinuing per capita payments on the existing basis, be-
cause the States seriously require the money at the
present time.
Mr. HUGHES.—I do not propose to keep the Con-
ference very long, and shall address myself, as far as I
am able, to the several points that have been raised.
First, I will deal with the understanding, or misunder-
standing, at the Conference of Premiers and myself in
October last. It has been said that there was no under-
standing at all. That is not a correct representation


of the facts. It was desired by the Commonwealth to
have power to deal with the high cost of living and
industrial unrest in the aftermath of war. The Pre-
miers and myself discussed this matter, and it was gene-
rally agreed that, so far as the high cost of living, pro-
fiteering, and industrial unrest were concerned, the
Commonwealth ought to have, during the reconstruction
period at any rate, extended powers. There was some
difference of opinion as to what powers Were necessary.
I at first asked that those powers should he given to us
permanently. As the Conference was opposed to that,
I said, “ Very well, I will ask you for them for a limited
periodand in order that there might he no misunder-
standing I said, “ Unless I call a Contention before the
31st December this year the power will lapse. If I
called a Convention, then the power would lapse when
the Convention had put the matter to the people, and
the people had replied, or within three years.” I said
I Would limit the operation of the proposal to three
years, or until the Convention, and I called a Conven-
tion for this year. It was to meet before the 31st
December, and I said I would put that limitation in the
Bill to amend the Constitution so that there should he
HO misunderstanding. Therefore, that Convention had
relation to the Bill which was to he introduced to the
House. It has been sought to be shown here that it was
not that Convention which was meant, hut any Conven-
tion. That contention must fail. The understanding
at the Conference was that, provided these powers were
given, the Treasurer’s suggestion that the per capita
payment should decrease year by year by 2s. fid. per
head should be suspended until the Convention had an
opportunity to deal with it. The Premiers went away.
It was said that they were to recommend this proposal
to their Government. Some did, and some did not.
How Mr. Mitchell says the proposals put forward to the
people were not the proposals agreed to. In reply to
that statement I will quote from the Federal Hansard
of 10th October, 1919, page 13293. I said—
The unanimity of the Committee—
That is to say, the Committee appointed by the Con-
ference to settle this matter—
that full power is necessary to deal With all industrial disputes,
Whether extending beyond , one State or not, is also significant.
The Committee agreed to that, though, of course, when
we sought to obtain the full power the Conference was
opposed to it. You, gentlemen, or your predecessors,
agreed that full power is necessary to deal with indus-
trial disputes, and are committed by your statements
to the decision of the Committee. I also said —
On certain points the Committee finds unanimously that the
powers asked for are greater than is necessary.
For instance, on the nationalization of monopolies and
on other points I said that we must have full powers.
I have said publicly, and I repeat, that the Government wilt
ndi use those powers except for the purposes I have named.
But it is essentia], if the powers are to be effective for those
purposes, that they should not he further limited.
This was* WO will keep within the powers that the Com-
mittee unanimously said we ought to have. Owing
maiHly to the attitude of the Premiers, the people re-
jected this proposal. In Hew South Wales there was a
belated reference to the proposal. It was the same
in Victoria. In the State of Western Australia the
people were told to reject it. In the State of Tasmania
they were told to reject it.
The PRESIDENT. —The Premier of Tasmania re-
commended the acceptance of the proposal.
Mr. HUGHES.—I am glad to hear that. I stated
in the House of Representatives on 19th October—-
I desire to emphasise that the Committee did not disagree
as to what was necessary. On the assumption that we asked
for powers to deal with the aftermath of war-—providing that
what was referred to them had reference to what were the
powers necessary to deal with the aftermath of war—they de-
cided that All these power* Were accessary. Hie oily different*
of opinion arose over whether that Was what was referred to
them. Upon that point I will briefly quote from ray oofli-
ments also, and-will ask that it, be published in full in Eaneard.
It is abundantly clear. The honorable member for Maribyr-
nong (Mr. Fenton) had spoken of the clarity of Vision of the
layman, As one who was a layman before he became a lawyer,
I shall not venture to say whether I see more clearly noW than
I did previously, but I Will venture the view that even a lawyer
Cotild understand this. 1 could hot be fairer than that.
When Mr. Lawson asked me what Was my offer, 1 said I
wanted to make the position perfectly clear. Mr. Lawson re-
marked that Sir Robert Garran, Professor Harrison Moore, and
Professor Jethro Brown—■
are to confer and advise what minimum powers are trans-
ferred to Federal authority to enable it to deal with pro-
fiteering and industrial unrest.
I then interposed, and said—
I want the position to be made quite clear. The powers
required are those necessary to deal effectively with the
aftermath of the war, including industrial unrest, high
cost of living, and profiteering.
That was the matter that the Committee, which you all
agreed to, was appointed to deal with. I kept my part
of the bargain, and submitted it to Parliament. 1 did
what I would not have done for £50,000. I amended
those proposals that year in and year out I have advo-
cated in this country. I left out the railway men,
because the Premiers ashed me. I was the subject, of
course, of much hostile criticism. After all that* some
Premiers advised the people to vota against the_ pro-
posals. That placed me in a very unfortunate position.
Others damned the proposals with faint praise, and
none of them came out definitely and said, “ These
powers ought to be given to the Commonwealth to deal
with the questions of industrial unrest and profiteering,”
although every one agreed that We ought to have the
powers. So that in respect of the Convention men-
tioned, and the proposal to reduce the per capita grant,
the Coirfmonwealth is under no obligation to post-
pone the matter. The proposal does not exist.
Mr. Eihelly evidently misunderstood what I said, for
the greater part of his remarks were directed against
a proposal that was very different from mine—a pro-
posal to abolish the per capita payments forthwith.
However, I made the position perfectly clear. Mr.
Storey quoted a number of figures, and asked whether
we want .to crush the States and bring about unifica-
tion? "Well, I do not; hut the party to which he and
Mr. Eihelly belong is pledged to it. They dare not
stand up in any Labour Conference and oppose that. I
never advocated unification in my life at any Labour
Conference, and if I were at a Labour Conference to-
night I would oppose it.
Mr. STOREY.—So would I.
Mr. HUGHES.—You cannot. It is on your plat-
form, yet you get up here and denounce the very thing
you are committed fo. However, let that pass. One
of our proposals was that there should be one , public
borrower. You do not reject that for the reason that
it is a proposal to limit your expenditure. You re-
ject it even when it is merely a proposal that there
should be one borrower instead of seven. I put for-
ward a proposal to have one taxation faper. Heaps
of objections were raised against that. You profess
to he willing to meet the Commonwealth,. and there is
not a proposal of the Commonwealth that you do not
reject straight out, or else accept and go back to your
States and oppose, or ask your people to do nothing.
As far aa the amendment of the Constitution is con-
cerned, you take up a perfectly logical attitude. How-
ever, let that pass. We will fight that out somewhere
else; hut when it comes to the question of the expendi-
ture of public money, clearly the per capita grant and
the proposals in relation thereto are relevant, and I
am entirely with those who say that, the per capita
grant ought not to he made a bargain for the granting
of constitutional powers, and, further, that all the pres-
sure that may be brought to hear in that connexion is


not worth 2d. to me. I would not give you 2d. for it,
and would not take 2d. away from you. But when it
comes to the expenditure of public money, I think I
have a right to say, as head of the Government of the
Commonwealth, that we must have some financial un-
derstanding. If you will have a satisfactory financial
understanding with us in regard to the great public
works which I have mentioned, and of which most of
you are in favour, and a satisfactory understanding in
regard to borrowing and the one taxation paper, then
a modus vivendi can be reached. I want to remind
you of one or two points that have been overlooked.
We have lent you during the last few years
£19,700,000; and when I listened to that piteous story
of how much South Australia would be worse off in
ten years as a result of my proposal, and remembered
what we had lent to South Australia, I could not help
thinking that a story could be told on the other side
just as effectively. It was a good thing that we came
to the agreement that there should be one borrower.
I say it is the most sensible and business-like way of
carrying on the borrowing operations of Australia at
this time. One borrower is very much better than
seven. Mr. Ritchie said something about there being
two overseers, and so on, and I am bound to say that
I do not see what that has to do with the question of
there being one borrower. All I say is that there
should be only one borrower, and that we should meet
you and see how much you want.
Mr. RITCHIE.—That is another matter altogether.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—Here is a table showing
what We have lent the States during the war.
Mr. HUGHES.—For State public works the amount
is £40,374,000. At this very moment the State of
South Australia can get from the Commonwealth
£336,000. "We have lent the States £10,000,000 in con-
nexion with the settlement of the soldiers on the land.
That money has been spent in your States, and we are
committed, I suppose, to about another £20,000,000.
Sir JOSEPH COOK.—About another £30,000,000.
I think.
Mr. HUGHES. —That makes £80,000,000 alto-
gether. I do not know that in refusing to entertain
a proposal of national importance the Conference has
been .very complimentary to the Commonwealth. The
hour is late, and I do not know if we can come to a de-
cision now, but I would suggest to the President that
before the Premiers return, to their homes they should
meet with the representatives of the Commonwealth
to see if we cannot settle these matters. I will go
into the whole question. I want to make myself per-
fectly clear. The understanding is that whatever is
done will be done upon certain conditions, and unless
and until those conditions happen, Mr. Watt’s sug-
gestion goes on, or rather it will go on if they do not
happen. You, gentlemen, may say, “ Yes,” and go back
and do nothing. You may say, “ No,” and do nothing.
I have to get something before the Commonwealth Par-
liament. Everything I said I would get through I have
had passed. Mr. Storey, on behalf of the State he re-
presents, has taken up a sympathetic attitude with re-
gard to the uniform gauge, although his State will not
have to make any change, having the 4-ft. B|-in. gauge.
We ought to be able to agree upon these matters, and
this Conference ought not to break up without having
done something that will benefit Australia. I am pre-
pared to meet the Premiers on the lines I have laid
down. I feel pretty confident that, after hearing what
we have to say, we can come to an agreement. If you
are agreeable to leave it to me to fix a time of meeting,
We can settle these matters before very long.
Mr. RITCHIE.—What is the period of the con-
tinuance of the per capita grant ?
Mr. HUGHES.—That is one of the things subject
to the Convention. So far as the Commonwealth
is concerned, we will leave it to the Convention. We
will be done with it, and when the Convention
has arrived at a decision we can fight it out be-
fore the people. That was the original proposal,
and I repeat it now. When it was first brought for-
ward it was in relation to a matter quite foreign to
it. It is related now to the expenditure of public
money. I suggest, however, that we should not discuss
details now, hut leave it to the Premiers to settle. I
confine myself to the proposition now made to thjs Con-
ference, and we know where we are.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I should like to say a few
words in regard to this pronosal so far as it was dealt
with at the last Conference we had with the Acting
Prime Minister. I think lam correct in saying that
you, Mr. President, and I are the only two at this Con-
ference who were present at the last one. Reference has
been made to the arrangement which was arrived at. I
understand the Prime Minister to have said that, be-
cause of the fact that the agreement then entered into
was not kept by the Premiers, he justifies his departure
from the understanding that the per capita payment
was to remain unchanged until after the Convention
had dealt with it. It is only fair that I should say ex-
actly what was the position.
Mr. HITCHES.—I must rise to a point of order. I
waited until the representative of every State had
spoken, and I do not think we should go into the matter
again. I feel I cannot do justice to it at this late hour.
Sir WALTER. LEE.—If the Prime Minister does
not want this matter to be debated I have no intention
of forcing the discussion. It would be of no value in
view of the admission the Prime Minister has made. If
there is a prospect of coming to some agreement, I shall
be happy to waive any discussion about it just now,
but when he stated that we broke an agreement I was
not prepared to sit silent under such a change. We did
not break an agreement. Something else was put in
which was not agreed to by us. But lam not going to
stress that. I understand that, in consideration of the
States agreeing to undertake certain public works, the
Prime Minister is prepared to consider the continuation
of the per capita grant until the Convention decides
the matter.
Mr. HUGHES.— We all know each other’s mind,
and I am prepared to discuss the proposal on the basis
I have indicated, and without prejudice, at a meeting
to be called by the Premier of Victoria.
The PRESIDENT.—What the Prime Minister sug-
gests now is that, some time before the Premiers return
to their States, they should meet the Prime Minister in
Committee, and discuss these proposals, with one or two
outstanding subjects which have not been fully dealt
with at this Conference. I think we might accept that
suggestion.
Sir WALTER LEE.—I take it that we will also
discuss what period of time will have to elapse before
the Convention will be called to consider this question.
The PRESIDENT.—We will discuss it in all its
aspects. The question is—
That the dehate he adjourned, and that the State Premiere
further discuss the matter with the Prime Minister on Satur-
day, the 29 th instant, at 11 a.m.
Sir WALTER LEE.—When will that be?
The PRESIDENT.—You will have to leave it to
the Prime Minister and myself to arrange a date.
Mr. FIHELLY.—There are objections to a uniform
form for taxation purposes, but as far as I can see there
is no real objection.
Mr. HUGHES.—We will discuss that. If you can
get one tax-gatherer it will be economy, and I will he a
warm advocate of it.
The motion for the adjournment of the debate was
agreed to.


AVIATION".
The PRESIDENT.—It is for the Conference t*
determine what other business shall be done, and
whether the members wish to meet again.
Mr. HUGHES.—There are some other matters that
we have not dealt with at all. There is, for instance
the navigation of the air. We have to come to an
understanding about that, and the proposal you make
is not quite satisfactory to us. My colleague, the Min-
ister for Defence, has looked into the matter, and he
finds that it does not cover the ground at all. We want
to have the same control over the air as we have over
the sea, leaving you perfectly free to own what ships
you like and what aircraft you like, and to put them to
any use you like except that of defence. We run the
rule of the road.
Mr. BARWELL.—That was all we asked.
Mr. HUGHES.—It is useless to pass legislation U
give effect to the British Act, because that would not
carry us any further.
The PRESIDENT.—That was only with the object
of getting some measure of control right away. As
soon as you introduced legislation, our Act would be by
the board.
Senator PEARCE.—We could in this session pass an
Act to come into force as soon as the States have passed
enabling Acts.
The PRESIDENT.—We want that done as quickly
as possible.
Senator PEARCE. —As soon as you pass the enabling
Acts you would get quickly forward, and why should
the six States Parliaments have to pass similar legisla-
tion when one Act will suffice?
Mr. HUGHES.—The States, I understand, will have
exactly the same rights in regard to the air as in regard
to the sea, that is to say, they can own what aircraft
they like, and put them to commercial or any other
use, and they retain the police powers.
The PRESIDENT.—It is understood that in this
Conference not only financial matters can be referred
to; but any outstanding matters which we have not
finalized in which the Commonwealth and States are
interested.
It was agreed that the consideration of this question
be adjourned to the meeting with the Prime Minister on
the 29th instant.
MURRAY WATERS.
Mr. GROOM.—The Committee on the Murray
Waters submits the following recommendations:—
That this Conference recognising the necessity of expedition
in connexion with the completion of the River Murray scheme
and the possibility of delays arising on account of the fact
that these works are at present being carried out by the
three State Governments in conjunction with other State
public works, recommends for the consideration of the State
Governments concerned that the scope of the River Murray
Commission be widened to enable that body to originate and
construct works, in order to permit of the whole of the
works to be carried out in the three States to be constructed
under the direct control of one authority.
It is recommended—
(l) That the Commonwealth should contribute one-fourth
to the total cost of the works constructed under the agree-
ment.
(2) That where the amount to be contributed by any State
in any year exceeds the sum of £125,000, the Commonwealth
to advance to the States by way of loan the amount of the
excess.
In addition to its own quota of £125,000, the Common-
wealth to contribute to the Commission a sum equal to that
advanced to each individual State.
(3) The agreement to be amended with a view to giving to
the Commission full control over all matters relating to the
initiation and construction of works referred to in the agree-
ment, which control at present rests with the respective con-
structing authorities.
(4) The three constructing authorities to place at the dis-
posal of the Commission such portion of the professional and
clerical staffs at present mainly engaged on River Murray
work as are required for the construction of works under the
agreement and are, in the opinion of the respective States,
available for such works.
(5) The Commission to have full control of all matters re-
lating to wages and conditions of employment of all employees
connected with River Murray works in each of the States, with
a view to arriving at uniformity and settlement of industrial
disputes —in which connexion the River Murray works through-
out the three States are to be regarded as a special work, and
quite apart from the other public works being carried out by
the three State Governments.
(6) The States to confer power upon the Federal Parlia-
ment to create a special tribunal to deal with disputes on
works under the control -of the Commission.
(7) Clause 6 of the River Murray agreement to be amended
by providing for the concurrence or three-fourths of the
members.
(8) All lands to be acquired by the States for the purposes
of land settlement, and which are affected by the River
Murray scheme to be acquired at not more than the value
as at the 4th July, 1921, plus 10 per cent., and the value
of any improvements effected thereafter.
(9) Each State shall pay to the Commonwealth one-fourth
of the value by which any land so acquired by it shall have
been enhanced by reason of the work under the River Murray
agreement. Such value shall be arrived at by deducting the
cost of resumption and of the work of distribution and de-
velopment from the value fixed for sub-divisonal sale or
lease.
Mr. HUGHES. —In what time does that contemplate
finishing the work?
Mr. GROOM. —At the present time we calculate the
rate of expenditure on the works to he about £500,000.
We say that the Commonwealth will lend to the States
any sum in excess of that so as to enable the works to
be speeded up to the fullest extent without embarrassing
the States. If the Committee’s recommendations are
carried into effect the Commission will he enabled to
take complete control of these works and speed them up
as fast as they like, and the process of speeding up will
not mean any extra drain on the finances of the States.
Mr. HUGHES. —If it is possible for the Commission
to do it in five years, there is nothing to prevent it?
Mr. GROOM. —The only thing is that the faster we
go the more the Commonwealth has to advance by way
of loan. Assuming that we have two main works going
on at the same time, it will give employment to a large
number of men.
Mr. HUGHES.—What number?
Mr. GROOM.—Judging from our experience, the
average number of men engaged on a lock is about 200.
Then the preliminary operations in connexion with the
large construction works at Lake Victoria and the Upper
Murray contemplate the employment of 150 on each side
of the river. Those works could he expedited, and a
larger number of men employed.
Mr. HUGHES. —I have not seen this report before,
but Ido not think it is worth a row of beans. You talk
about employing 150 men? Why, we were thinking of
thousands.
Mr. GROOM.—The Prime Minister has not under-
stood the position. Ordinarily speaking, we employ
about 200 on each lock.
Mr. HUGHES.—How many locks will there be?
Mr. GROOM. —The total scheme contemplates
thirty-five locks, and there is no reason why there should
not he a number under construction at the same time.
Mr. LANG.—Might not the scarcity of material 1 in-
terfere with that?
Mr. GROOM. —I think it would be only temporary.
When such temporary difficulties are got over, we
should be able to rush right ahead with the scheme.
Mr. CLARKE. —Perhaps I might give a short precis
of the proposals. At present each State contributes
£1,200,000, and the Commonwealth a flat £1,000,000.
The States are the constructing authorities. The first
clause of this report means that the Commonwealth will
come in on the same basis as the three States, and will
eventually contribute probably a second £1,000,000.
The second clause means that instead of a non-deter-
minate amount, which might grow to very large pro-
portions if Mr. Hughes’ ideas of hurrying the work


■along are taken up, as I think they will be, each State
has definitely to find £125,000 a year. Anything spent
over and above that will he lent by the Commonwealth
to the States. Clauses 3,4, 5, and 6 mean that the
Murray River Commission becomes the constructing
authority. I think that requires consideration, be-
cause it might imply that another vast department is
being built up. But I am sure my Cabinet will con-
sider the matter in a sympathetic way, and will see
whether they can agree to the whole thing. Inci-
dentally, I submit that the constitution of the Commis-
sion as the-constructing authority may offer a solution
of the difficult problem of strikes arising out of the
difference of wages as between New South Wales and
Victoria, because the proposal sets out that the area
under these reconstruction works shall be fenced off
from the rest of Australia in regard to wages, and that
a special tribunal shall fix the wages within the ringed
fence. Clause 9 is the only other important one. That
means that the clear profits upon the subdivisional re-
sale of irrigation lands will, to the exent of 25 per
cent., be paid to a sinking fund to re-pay the Com-
monwealth, and, in effect, to repay non-riparian /States
who have contributed through the Commonwealth
to the scheme. It is probable that the 75 per
cent, upon the re-sale of subdivisional blocks will
be sufficient, and can be used to liquidate tbe loans
advanced by the Commonwealth during the construc-
tion of the work, over 'and above the £125,000 from
each State per annum, so that there is a good deal to
commend itself to me in this scheme. There is only
the point as to who is to be the constructing authority.
The report was adopted.
EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS.
The PRESIDENT.-—Before we go I think I should
acknowledge the courtesy of the Prime Minister and
the assistance that he has been to us in our delibera-
tions, and tender to him and to his colleagues the
thanks of the Conference for their attendance and
contributions to the discussions.
Mr. HUGHES. —I thank you very much indeed,
and heartily reciprocate your good wishes and those of
your colleagues. It has been a pleasure to come here.
We have discussed various matters quite freely and
frankly, and I shall be amply repaid if we can prove
that our labour has not been barren. I desire, on be-
half of the Commonwealth, to tender to you, Mr. Pre-
sident, our thanks, and to say how much we appre-
ciate your courtesy and the tact with which you have
conducted the business of the Conference, as also youi
hospitality.
ENEMY ALIENS AND ENEMY PROPERTY.
Mr. BARWELL. —The Committee which was ap-
pointed to go into the question of Enemy Aliens and
Enemy Property has met. The question for the Com-
mittee and for the Conference is as to what action the
Crown is going to take with regard to enemy aliens
and the property of enemy aliens held by the public
trustees of the various States as custodwins. The sub-
ject is one of very great difficulty. It is highly techni-
cal, and one that it is impossible for this Conference
to finalize at the present time. The matter is being
considered by the Imperial authorities, and also, I un-
derstand, by the Commonwealth Government. A
little while back a telegram was received from the
Secretary of State to the Colonies on the subject, to
this effect—
Your telegrams, 20th January, 11th March. Acquisition of
land by aliens. The question is one of great complexity and
difficulty, and, as pointed out in your telegram of 20th
January, has an important international hearing. The whole
matter is now engaging careful consideration of His Ma-
jesty’s Government, but no definite decision yet reached.
I do not think we can do any more than suggest that
the various Governments take the matter into consi-
deration, and that the States Attorney-General con-
sult between themselves and with the Attorney-General
of the Commonwealth.
The PRESIDENT.—WouId you move that the mat-
ter be dealt with by correspondence?
Mr. HARWELL.—It might be possible to get the par-
liamentary draftsmen together. I know that our par-
liamentary draftsman will be over here in a few weeks’
time. Mr. Collins, the Victorian parliamentary drafts-
man, has gone into the matter very fully.
Mr. SC ADD AN. —Our Attorney-General is coming
over in a few weeks.
Mr. BARWELL.—I think we could get representa-
tives from the various States together. We certainly
want to know what view the Commonwealth Govern-
ment take of the matter, because it is a question of legal
difficulty as to exactly what are the rights and powers
of the States, and what are the rights and powers of the
Commonwealth. There is the property of alien enemies
now held by custodians. That property is either for-
feited or forfeitable. At any rate, it is the latter if not
the former. There seems to be some difference of
opinion about the matter. The suggestion of the Com-
mittee is that the matter should be left to correspon-
dence between the various State Governments and the
Commonwealth Government. I move—
That these questions he dealt with by correspendence by the
various Attorneys-General, in consultation with the Common-
wealth Attorney-General, with a view to arriving at uniform
action.
The motion was agreed to.
UNIFORM RAILWAY GAUGE.
Mr. STOREY.—I move—
That the question of the uniform railway gauge be referred
to the Conference of the Premiers with the Prime Minister on
Saturday.
The motion was agreed to.
RAILWAY SUB-COMMITTEE’S REPORT.
The report of the sub-Committee appointed to con-
sider railway matters was further dealt with.
Mr. SC ADD AN reported that the sub-Committee had
amended certain of the recommendations, as follows:
3. Railway travelling by State members on Commonwealth
lines. —That members of the Commonwealth and State Parlia-
ments travel over State and Commonwealth railways on a
reciprocal basis.
4. life passes for V.C. holders.—That if life passes to
Victoria Cross holders bp issued by the Federal Government
over the Commonwealth railways, the State Governments be
invited to grant similar facilities over the State railways.
5. Railway travelling facilities for blinded and incapacitated
soldiers. —That this Conference is of opinion that free railway
facilities should be extended to blinded and totally incapaci-
tated soldiers on the condition that the Commonwealth Go-
vernment pays half the cost.
Railway facilities for officials travelling with Ministers, &c.—
That the privileges now enjoyed on the State railways, by
reciprocal arrangement between the States, by officials travel-
ling with Ministers, be extended to Commonwealth officials on
the State railways and to State officials on the Commonwealth
railways, and that the Commonwealth Government be asked
to agree to this arrangement.
It was ordered that tbe recommendations with regard
to railway travelling by State members on Common-
wealth lines and life passes for Victoria Cross holders
be referred to the various State Governments for
favorable consideration.
The remainder of the report was adopted.
SETTLEMENT OF SOLDIERS ON THE LAND.
Mr. MITCHELL. —I have to report that the Min-
isters of Lands have conferred with Senator Millen,
Minister for Repatriation, regarding soldier settlement


on the land, and have arranged to meet him again on
28th June.
The report was received.
ADJOURNMENT OF THE CONFERENCE.
The PRESIDENT.—! suppose we will have merely
to adjourn the Conference now, as there will he this in-
formal meeting with the Prime Minister later in the
week. I am sorry the time has been so limited, but we
have discussed many matters of importance, and I hope
that some good results will follow. It is usual to pass
votes of thanks to the officers of the Conference, and 1
should like Mr. Storey to take the matter in hand.
Mr. STOREY. —Before we deal with the officers,
there is one other matter I should like to refer to.
This is probably the last occasion on which the members
of the Conference as at present constituted will have the
privilege and pleasure of meeting one another. I de-
sire to move—
That the best thanks of this Conference be conveyed to the
President for the magnificent manner in which he has con-
ducted the proceedings.
I am not exaggerating in the slightest degree in using
the word It has been my privilege
during my political life, as well as before, to sit under
many Chairmen with varying qualifications, and I can
unhesitatingly say,*and I am sure it will be indorsed
by all tbe members of tbe Conference, that you have
ooeducted the business in a fashion that will do credit
to the best. You have in every way met our wishes, and
your conduct in helping us out of difficulties has been
in the highest degree satisfactory. Your courtesy to
every member, your consideration for every member’s
feelings, and the skilful way in which you have handled
the business, have all been admirable. I am not exag-
gerating when I say that you have done the work as
Chairman in a superior manner to that of any chairman
1 have had the privilege to sit under. I am sure the
members of the Conference can truthfully say that you
have helped them in a manner that has lightened their
duties. You have made our work pleasurable, and have
caused us to do it in a fashion that will compare with
any who have preceded us. Of course, these Confer-
ences have been attended by men who have had more
experience that I have had, and who have given more
intelligent consideration to the subjects discussed. My
colleagues and 1 have been in office for little more than
a month, during which time I have been working night
and day endeavouring to gather together the threads of.
scattered affairs. In New South Wales there is a social
side to our political life that is pleasant in many ways,
but is a terrible drawback when one has business to
do. Even newspaper intervention has not stopped this
distraction, for the newspapers appealed to the people
to let me get on with the work. The papers that were
prepared for me in view of this Conference I was not
able to open until I arrived at this table. My col-
leagues and myself would suffer by comparison with the
knowledge brought to bear by my distinguished pre-
decessor, Mr. Holman. You, Mr. President, have made
our task very light, so that any shortcomings have dis-
appeared. I shall always remember with pleasure my
first appearance at this table under your Chairmanship.
Sir WALTER LEE.—Perhaps I may he permitted,
as the, senior Premier of the Conference, to have the
privilege of seconding the motion so ably moved by Mr.
Storey. I have had the privilege, during the last four
years, of attending the various Conferences held in dif-
ferent States. At my first I was in the same position
as Mr. Storey now finds himself. I was the baby of
the Conference, having been Premier for only a few
Weeks at that time. Mr. Scaddan claimed to he the
daddy on that Occasion, and I was the infant. Through
the whirligig of polities and the hand of death, changes
have taken place that cause me to he the Premier hold-
ing the longest record of office. I can certainly indorse
all that Mr. Storey has said as to the way you hare con-
ducted the business of the Conference. You have been
tactful, and helped us when we appeared to he getting
into difficulties, by a happy suggestion that has led to
a solution of the trouble. The work has progressed
in the happiest manner. We shall also like to express
our appreciation of the great generosity you have shown
in providing for our creature comforts. Nothing has
been left undone in that direction, and we greatly ap-
preciate it. I agree that the way in which .the business
has been conducted will compare very favorably with
the way business has been conducted at other Confer-
ences I have attended. On behalf of my colleagues and
myself, I have to express appreciation of your kindness
and consideration.
Mr. FIHELLY.—-I can only indorse what has
already been said. You, Mr. President, have been most
capable, and we could not but appreciate your conduct
in the Chair. Personally, I have enjoyed the whole
business. The work was hard for us, but harder still
for you. I hope that some good will result from our
labours.
The motion was carried by acclamation.
The PRESIDENT.—Mr. Storey and gentlemen, I
thank you very sincerely for your cordial vote of thanks.
If I have given you any satisfaction by the way in
which I discharged the duties of President I have been
amply repaid. The State of Victoria has endeavoured
to provide a certain measure of hospitality for you. It
is true that we have not been able to he as attentive in
that way as other States, have been. The practice has
hitherto been for the Conference to rise at 5 o’clock
every day, hut we have been compelled to sit day and
night, so that there has not been the same opportunity
for entertainment and relaxation. I hope your stay hak
been pleasant, and that good will result from the Con-
ference. Sometimes the best fruits of a Conference do
not consist in the resolutions carried, but are due to the
better understanding that our association at the table
brings about between those in charge of State affairs in
the various States. If we get to know one another
more we shall understand one another’s point of view
better, and appreciate the conditions which we have in
our several States. lam glad to have had the oppor-
tunity of meeting you all, and have certainly enjoyed
the association very much indeed.
Mr. BARWELL.— I move —
That the best thanks of the Conference he tendered to the
officers and reporting staff and to the attendants for the able
and satisfactory way in which they have carried but their
various duties.
The work of the Conference has been somewhat trying
to members, but it must have been exceedingly heavy for
some of the officers. Their work has been much more
arduous than ours. I think our best thanks are due to
the officers for the splendid way in which they have
carried out their duties, and for their courtesy to mem-
bers of the Conference.
Mr. MITCHELL.—T have much pleasure in second-
ing the motion. The officers have my sincere thanks.
I am glad I am not an official, for I am sure they all
have had to do a great deal of hard work, but it has
been cheerfully performed by Mr. Short and the other
officials.
The motion was carried with acclamation.
The Conference adjourned at eight minutes past
eleven o’clock.


APPENDICES.
APPENDIX “A.”
Victorian Railways,
Commissioners’ Office, Spencer-street,
Melbourne, 14th May, 1920.
Dear Sis,
As Chairman of the Conference of Commissioners of the Railways of the various States and of the Commonwealth
which met in Melbourne for the purpose of dealing with a number of important matters concerning Railway
Administration, I am authorized to forward to you a copy of the following Resolution relative to the question of the
Unification of Gauges, which was adopted at the conclusion of the Conference to-day, viz. :
As the question of the Unification of Gauge is listed for discussion at the forthcoming Conference of
State Premiers, it is decided that the Secretary of that Conference be informed by the Chairman of the present
Commissioners’ Conference that the estimates prepared by the Railway Engineers in Conference in 1913 are
entirely out-of-date, and, consequently, before the subject can be definitely dealt with, it will be necessary to
have them revised.
Further, that the conditions of the Inter-State rail traffic now differ considerably from what they were
in 1913. Apart altogether from the necessity for unification from a Defence point of view, there has been a
great increase not only in the passenger, but also in the Inter-State goods, traffic hauled by rail, in consequence
of the curtailment of shipping due to the War conditions and to the recent dislocation of sea trade brought about
by other causes, and to the fact that the Shipping Companies have-considerably increased their charges. It
is confidently anticipated that a large share of the additional Inter-State business that has accrued to the Railways,
especially during the past year or so, will be retained ; and this, combined with the difficulties of transfer and
the delays that occur to goods and rolling-stock at the Border stations, will necessitate the expenditure of large
sums of money in improving the transfer facilities unless the unification of gauges of the railways between the
Capital Cities of Australia and other necessary connexions therewith is proceeded with at an early date.
I am to suggest that you will be good enough to bring this Resolution under the notice of the State Premiers
at their forthcoming Conference.
Yours faithfully,
jas. mcguire,

Dear Sir,
Afl Chairman of the Conference of Commissioners of the Railways of the various States and the Commonwealth,
which met in Melbourne during this Week for the purpose of dealing with a number of important matters concerning
Railway Administration, I am desired to intimate that the recently levied ad valorem duty of 35 per cent, on Steel and
Iron Wheels and Steel-tired Wheels, &c., and of 25 per cent, on copper plates, all of which were previously admitted
free of duty, was fully discussed by the Members, and it was agreed that I should communicate with you, pointing
out: —
(1) That in the opinion of the Commissioners in Conference ad valorem duty should not be levied in respect
of materials not manufactured in Australia which are required for the construction of rolling-stock;
and
(2) That duty should not be collected on materials required for the construction of rolling-stock which were
ordered from Abroad prior to the levying of the present duty, for the reason that sufficient quantities
of such materials of Australian manufacture were unprocurable.
I am to suggest that you will bo good enough to bring under notice for consideration at the forthcoming
Conference of State Premiers the views expressed by the Commissioners as briefly stated above.
Yours faithfully,
JAS. McGUTRE,
Railways Commissioner, South Australia,

Conferences of Premiers and Ministers of the States of the
Commonwealth of Australia.
Report by the Executive Officer (the Premier of New South Wales) respecting the action taken under
the authority of the decisions reached at the Conferences held in Sydney in May. 1918, and in
Melbourne in July, 1918, and January, 1919.
PROGRESS REPORT No. 8,
The last regular Conference of Premiers was held in Sydney, in May, 1918, but since
that date the Acting Prime Minister asPed the Treasurers to meet him in Melbourne in
July, 1918, to discuss certain financial problems, and in January, 1919, convened a
Conference of Premiers and other State Ministers to discuss specially questions relating
to the settlement of soldiers on the land, and to consider further the financial proposals
which had been placed before the Treasurers.
In dealing with the resolutions adopted at these Conferences I have deemed
it advisable to follow each matter to finality through the two or three Conferences at
which it was discussed.
The resolutions adopted at the Conferences and the action taken thereon are
as follow:
CONFERENCE OF PREMIERS, SYDNEY, Bth to 15th MAY, 1918.
PAYMENT OF OLD-AGE PENSIONERS IN STATE HOSPITALS AND
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
Resolved :— That the Commonwealth be requested to pay—
(l) Full maintenance allowance to the States for all pensioners in State Hospitals and
Charitable Institutions.
(2) * * *
(3) * * *
At a later stage of the proceedings it was decided that this matter should be further considered
at the Conference of Treasurers which the Prime Minister proposed to convene.
This Conference took place in July, 1918, and the Acting Prime Minister presented a memo-
randum setting out the Commonwealth’s point of view, and intimated that it had been decided to
make payment to hospitals at the rate of 10s. 6d. per week for maintenance of pensioners who had
become inmates of proclaimed hospitals and remained there continuously for a period in excess of
28 days. He intimated that no payment would be made to hospitals for periods of residence up to
and including 28 days, because it was thought advisablethat a pensioner’s money should be accumulated
for a period of four weeks in order that, upon discharge, he might be able to purchase comforts
necessary during convalescence.
The Acting Prime Minister at the same time said that the rate of payment to Benevolent
Asylums for maintenance of pensioners would be increased from Bs. tp 10s. 6d. per week.
The rates proposed by the Commonwealth were agreed to by the Conference, and payment
took efiect from Ist August, 1918.
Last year further representations were made in writing to the Commonwealth Government on
certain aspects of the arrangement, more particularly on behalf of the States of Queensland, Western
Australia, and New South Wales.
It was claimed on behalf of Queensland that persons admitted to the Dunwich Benevolent
Asylum who had previously lodged applications for pensions had not been granted the pensions, and
also that a number of persons are maintained at tbe same asylum at no cost whatever to the Com-
monwealth although they are eligible for a pension. In such cases it was considered that the Com-
monwealth Government should pay the usual allowance for maintenance.
In reply the Prime Minister stated that it was not the practice of the Commonwealth to refuse
payment for maintenance merely because a person who had submitted a claim for a pension became
an inmate of an institution prior to tbe determination of tbe claim, and that the claim is admitted,
and payment to the State is authorized provided the necessary qualifications are established.
On behalf of Western Australia and New South Wales a claim was made for the maintenance
of old-age pensioners admitted to the Hospitals for the Insane, but tbe Prime Minister intimated that
it was not proposed to extend payment to such institutions.
The New South Wales Government has now requested the Commonwealth Government to
cause the institutions under the control of the Inspector-General of Mental Hospitals in New South
Wales to be proclaimed “ Hospitals ” under the provisions of the “ Old-age Pensions Act,” in order
to remove the technical objection to the payment of pensions as maintenance. (A 20/78.)

MAINTENANCE OF SOLDIERS, INTERNED ENEMY SUBJECTS, AND
SEAMEN OF SHIPS, IN CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
Resolved : —-That the Commonwealth be requested to pay—
* • *
2. Maintenance for all soldiers suffering from mental, pulmonary, or other affections, all
interned enemy subjects, and all seamen of ships under Commonwealth control
similarly affected who are treated in State or State-subsidized institutions, and
g * * *
At a later stage of the proceedings it was resolved that this question should
be referred for further consideration to the Conference of Treasurers, which the Acting
Prime Minister proposed to convene. This Conference took place in July, 1918, and the
Acting Prime Minister presented a report to the following effect:—
(а) That the Commonwealth is paying for the maintenance of soldiers suffering from mental,
pulmonary, and other affections whilst they are under its control.
(б) That the maintenance and control of enemy subjects while they were interned was considered,
and it was decided that as the custody of mental patients is a function of the State it was not
thought that the cost of maintenance should be borne by the Commonwealth.
(c) That the payment for the maintenance of sailors sent to hospital by captains of vessels is
governed by British Law, and it is the intention of the Management of the Commonwealth
Government Line of Steamers to pay for the maintenance of seamen in hospitals where such
maintenance must be paid for under British Law.
The Conference of Treasurers accepted the explanation made by the Acting
Prime Minister. Subsequently, however, it was suggested to the Prime Minister that
the present arrangements, whereby the States bear the cost of maintenance of those
returned soldiers, who become inmates of mental hospitals after discharge from military
service, should be revised in the direction of debiting the Repatriation Department
with the expense. Up to date no reply has been received from the Prime Minister.
The attention of the Prime Minister has also been drawn to the fact that many enemy
internees who are now inmates of State Mental Hospitals were not originally residents
of the State which now bears the cost of maintenance, and he was asked if the Common-
wealth Government would undertake to maintain such persons. No reply to these
representations is yet to hand. (A 19/1812).
ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES TO WIVES AND FAMILIES OF INTERNED
ENEMY SUBJECTS.
Resolved :—That the Commonwealth be requested to pay—
(l) * * *
(2) * * *
(3) Any necessary additional allowances to the wives and families of interned enemy aliens
it may be necessary to give for their maintenance.
At a later stage of the proceedings it was resolved that this question should
be referred for further consideration to the Conference of Treasurers which the Acting
Prime Minister proposed to convene. This Conference took place in July, 1918, and the
Acting Prime Minister presented the following report: —
With reference to allowances to wives and families of interned aliens in destitute circumstances,
the following payments are being made under War Financial Regulation 74
In all States except Western Australia—
12s. 6d. per week for a wife, 2s. 6d. per week for each child.
In Western Australia— .
-16 s. per week for a wife, 3e. per week for each child.
The rate for the wife is based on the old-age pension rate, and the total payments for the
Commonwealth amount to approximately £6,800 per annum. The cost of increased payments is
dependent on the opinion as to what rates of allowances are considered reasonable for families of
enemy subjects ; but the view of this Department (Commonwealth Pensions) is that the old-age pension
rate should not be exceeded. No information is held regarding the total amount of additional
payments that are being made by the States and which they desire the Commonwealth to take over.
The Conference accepted the Acting Prime Minister’s statement as satis-
factory, but subsequently representations were made in writing to the Commonwealth
Government with, respect to the repayment of certain supplementary allowances
made by the New South Wales Government and the value of rations allowed by the
Western Australian Government. The Prime Minister replied that allowances had
been made to certain dependants of internees in Western Australia, in accordance
4
95


with the provisions of the War Financial Regulations, and that it was not proposed
to recoup the Government of Western Australia for any benefits the latter had allowed,
it being considered that the liability of the Commonwealth in connexion with the
dependents of destitute internees was limited to the payment of the allowances referred
to. (B 19/723.)
COMPARATIVE SALARIES PAID COMMONWEALTH AND STATE
CIVIL SERVANTS.
Resolved :—That in the opinion of this Conference the obtaining of officers in the State Service
for Federal employment by offering higher rates of salary should be definitely discontinued.
Firstly, because the Federal Government should, like the State Governments, accept the
responsibility of recruitment and training of its own services ; and secondly, because in all
cases where the services of State officers with special qualifications are required during the
continuance of the war, the State Governments have from the beginning, and still are,
prepared to place all the resources of their Public Services at the disposal of the Common-
wealth.
This question was discussed with the Acting Prime Minister personally at the
Conference and again at the Conference of Treasurers and other Ministers held in July,
1918. At the latter it was decided it was decided that the whole matter whould be
investigated by the Commission which it was proposed should be appointed to investigate
cases of overlapping between Federal and State Departments.
Later on the question appeared on the Agenda of the Conference which was
held in Melbourne in January, 1919, but the report of the proceedings does not indicate
that the matter was discussed.
Although the Acting Prime Minister was reminded on several occasions of his
undertaking to appoint the proposed Commission nothing has been done to date.
(B 19/517.)
PROPOSED FORMATION OF A TRANSPORTATION BOARD.
Resolved ;—.
That, in view of the pressing nature of the problem of the distribution and cost of coal, the
States agree to send representatives to a Conference which the Commonwealth proposes
to summon for the purpose of creating a Board (representative of Commonwealth and
States) to control the pooling of railway and shipping freight charges on the transport
of coal.
The recommendations of such Conference and the scope of the operations of the proposed
Board shall be subject to the concurrence of the States affected.
The Conference referred to in the above resolution was held in conjunction
with the Conference of Treasurers in July, 1918. Ministers and Railway Officials
attended, representing the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
and Tasmania.
After discussion it was’resolved :
That, having heard the statement of Admiral Sir William Clarkson, this meeting of Delegates
is of opinion that the proposed Coal Board is unnecessary, and that the difficulty raised by the
Victorian Government, we respectfully suggest, is a matter upon which that Government might
approach the Commonwealth with the view of making such arrangement as may be necessary for
improving the methods of handling shipped coal.
The foregoing resolution was presented to the main Conference of Treasurers
and other Ministers, and special consideration was given to a letter from the Premier
of Victoria setting out the disabilities under which his State suffered through the
disposition of steamer freight in respect to the supply of coal to the various States.
After full discussion Conference decided to allow the matter to stand as it was,
and in view of this decision the matter has not been further pursued with the Common-
wealth authorities. (A 19/4.)
RECIPROCITY BETWEEN COMMONWEALTH AND STATE GOVERNMENTS
IN THE MATTER OF LEGISLATORS’ RAILWAY PASSES OVER FEDERAL
AND STATE RAILWAYS.
Resolved : —■
1. That the piinciple adopted in respect of the payment for passes over State railways to
Federal Members be applied to the issue of passes over Federal railways to State
Members.
2. That it be referred to a Conference of Railway Officials to report upon the charges
involved in this proposal.
5


The Conference of Railway Commissioners referred to above was held in
November, 1918, and recommended :
( 'a) That the question be regarded as applicable only to the passes held by Members of the
respective State Parliaments (568 in number).
(b) That as a tentative arrangement these passes be available over the Commonwealth Railways
including sleeping-beiths, but not meals) on payment to the Commonwealth Railways
Commissioner of a sum at the rate of £2 for each Membej.
(c) That the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner keep records of State Members’ travelling
over Commonwealth during the year ending 31st December, 1919, and then advise the
Chairman of the Commissioners’ Conference as to the proportions in which the various
States were represented by such Members.
(d) That the annual charge per Member and the proportion of the total charge to be borne by
each State be reviewed after the first year.
These resolutions were conveyed to the various States, all of which concurred
in the arrangement with the exception of Tasmania, from which no reply has been
received. The arrangement came into operation on Ist January, 1919. (B 19/1324.)
RECOGNITION OF LIFE RAILWAY PASSES ISSUED TO FEDERAL
x AND STATE MINISTERS.
Resolved That life passes issued to Prime Ministers or Premiers who have held office for one
year. Presidents of the Senate, and Speakers of the House of Representatives, Presidents of
the Legislative Councils and Speakers of the Legislative Assemblies who have held office
for three years, Cabinet Ministers who have held office for four years in the aggregate, shall
be recognised over Federal and State railways by the issue of gold passes, available over all
lines, to such persons.
The foregoing resolution was referred for consideration to a Conference of
Railway Commissioners which had been asked to deal with the question of making
arrangements for travelling over the Commonwealth Railways by State Members.
This Conference was held in November, 1918, when it was resolved :
“ That the resolution adopted at the Commissioners’ Conference in 1911 (No. 706) and re-
affirmed at the Commissioners’ Conference in 1912 (No. 759), namely :
That as it would be impossible to determine the Value of the concession, and that even if
an arbitrary annual payment were fixed it would be difficult to apportion such a payment
amongst the Several States with any degree of equity, it would be advisable to adopt a system
of vouchers which could be procured from the Government by the holder of the life-pass when
he desired to journey outside his own State, on presentation of which the necessary tickets could
be obtained free of charge, and the value of the same debited to the Treasury of the State in
which the life-pass holder resides.
be again confirmed, and that it should apply equally to life-passes issued over Commonwealth Railways
to Federal Members.”
The resolution having been communicated to the several Governments, the
following advice was received :
COMMONWEALTH .. Concurred in the proposed arrangement.
NEW SOUTH WALES .. Concurred, except in the last paragraph. Expressed opinion that the
State which issued a life-pass should bear the cost of travelling in
other States, not the State in which the life-pass holder resides.
VICTORIA .. .. Approved of the system of issuing vouchers. Assuming that an
adjustment of accounts is necessary in respect of each journey
taken outside the State in which the pass is issued, the State in
respect of which the pass is held should bear the charge.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA .. The charges arising from the adoption of this system should be debited
to the State in which the holder qualified for the privilege.
QUEENSLAND .. Is not in agreement with the proposal of the Railways Commissioners,
as it is considered that it would be more satisfactory for the life-
passes to be recognised over the railways of the Commonwealth and
the other States, in the same way as the passes of Members of
Parliament are recognised.
On 30tb September, 1919, the Prime Minister advised that “ the arrangement
may now be regarded as in operation, except so far as the Tasmanian life-pass holders,
or travelling on the Tasmanian Railways are concerned.”
It might perhaps be added that the Commonwealth has now withdrawn from
use life-passes over the Commonwealth Railways which were issued some years ago
by the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways and the design of which was
objected to by the States. A new design has been adopted which is quite distinctive
from that of the pass issued to State Legislators over State Railways.
9618.—9 0


The Commonwealth Government has recently requested that where necessary
immediate legislative action be taken by the States to secure to ex-Prime Ministers
and others concerned life railway passes entitling them to travel wherever they desire
in the States in which they reside, with the privilege of obtaining ticket orders when
they wish to travel outside their own States. (A 19/252.)
UNIFORM PUBLIC HOLIDAYS.
Resolved : —That this Conference affirms the desirableness of establishing uniformity between
the States in respect of public holidays, and that a schedule be prepared setting forth the
public holidays in the respective States, and subsequently submitted to each Government
with a view to further conferring thereon.
The resolution was communicated to the States, and schedules were obtained
of the holidays granted in each State. From a perusal of the lists it is evident that
there is considerable diversity in the number of holidays granted in each State, and
in the dates on which such holidays are observed.
The following statement will convey some idea of the existing position
(a) Holidays common to all States —■
Ist January, New Year’s Day.
March or April, Good Friday.
„ „ Easter Eve (Saturday).
~ „ Easter Monday.
3rd June, King’s Birthday.
25th December, Christmas Day.
(b) Holidays common to more than one State — Observed in—
26th January, Anniversary Day. All States except Western Australia.
March or April, Easter Tuesday. All States except New South Wales and
Queensland.
23rd June, Prince of Wales Birthday. New South Wales, South Australia, Queens-
land and Western Australia (Bank Holi-
day only in Western Australia).
26th December, Boxing Day. All States except South Australia.
27th ~ Western Australia' and Victoria (public
offices only in latter).
(c) Holidays peculiar to one State only—
— August, (Ist Monday) Bank Holiday. New South Wales.
2nd January, Public offices only. Victoria.
September, Show Day. „
November, Cup Day (public offices only). „
Ist March, St. David’s Day. Queensland.
17th March, St. Patrick’s Day. ~
23rd April, St. George’s Day. „
—■ September, (2nd Monday) Friendly So- „
cieties’ Day)
30th November, St. Andrew’s Day. „
6th May, Accession Day. South Australia.
28th December, Proclamation Day. „ „
2nd January, Anniversary Day (in lieu of Western Australia.
26th January).
Ist June, Foundation Day. „ „
October, (Ist week) Royal Show. ~ „
21st October, Proclamation Day and Eight ~ „
Hour Day.
(d) Eight Hour Day —
Observed in all States, but on varying dates.
Most of the holidays are statutory, so that if any uniform schedule be decided
upon, legislation will be necessary in every State. There appears to be no possibility
of arriving at any satisfactory decision without further discussion in Conference, and
the matter has therefore been listed for consideration at next Conference. (B 19/2452.)
THIRD RAIL DEVICE.
Resolved :—-
That the question of the third rail device be referred to the Committee which has been
organized by the Commonwealth Government, with the request that it be made the
subject of an early report.
That on receipt of the report of the committee of experts there should be an early meeting
of the Commonwealth and State Ministers controlling railways to consider the advis-
ability of an early practical application of the third rail system on some selected
section.
7


The Committee of Railway Experts met in August, 19X8, and decided that:—
The device was impracticable and unreasonable ; and as the 4-ft. gauge had already been
agreed to as the standard for Australian railways, the third-rail device was so limited in its range of
usefulness that it could be only a poor expedient, which would tend to complications, and prevent a
more complete and effective system from being introduced.
Having visited Tocumwal and inspected the device installed there, the Committee
was unable to modify its conclusions, and further recommended that any additional
experimental work be not undertaken.
In view of the adverse report of the railway experts, the New South Wales
Government, at whose instance the matter was placed on the Conference Agenda,
decided not to press it any further. (8.19/702.)
UNIFORM COMPANY LAW.
Resolved :—That it is desirable that an amended Company Law be introduced in each State, as
far as possible, upon uniform lines. That the States forthwith enter into correspondence
with a view to removing as much as is possible of the difference on points of detail still
outstanding.
After exchanging correspondence with the 'other States the New South Wales
Government suggested that, in view of the difficulty of convening a Conference of
Parliamentary Draftsmen to prepare a draft Bill for consideration, the attempt to
secure absolute uniformity be abandoned, and that the New South Wales Act be
amended so as to bring that State’s legislation on the subject up to date. This course
was subsequently adopted, and the Companies (Registration of Securities) Act 1918,
was passed by the New South Wales Parliament, thereby making the legislation of that
State uniform with that of England and most of the States of the Commonwealth.
The New South Wales Government suggested that further action might be
deferred, pending the passage by the Federal Parliament of one Act for the whole of
the Commonwealth. The other States concurred in the adoption of this course.
(A 19/700.)
ADOPTION OP UNIFORM FOOD STANDARDS.
Resolved :—That the New South Wales Government be requested to draft a model Pure Food
Act, and submit it to the other States for their consideration.
Owing chiefly to the large amount of extra work consequent upon the outbreak
of pneumonic influenza, the Director-General of Public Health was not able to give
early attention to this matter, but it is now in hand. The draft Bill will be circulated
amongst the States at the earliest possible moment. (A.20/393.)
RECOGNITION OF CONSULAR APPOINTMENTS.
Resolved That, in the opinion of this Conference, State Governments should accept the
settlement of this matter contained in the last Despatch received from the Colonial Office
as satisfactory.
The resolution was on 28th May, 1918, communicated to the Governments of
the several States, and His Excellency the Governor of New South Wales was requested
to inform the Colonial Office that the solution of the difficulty proposed in Despatch
No. lof 17th January, 1918, had been accepted. (8.18/1830.)
STANDARDIZATION OF BLANKETS.
Resolved :—That the New South Wales Government be requested to prepare a draft Bill and
circulate the same amongst the State Governments, together with the fullest possible
information.
Owing to the heavy demands made upon the Parlimentary Draftsman of the
New South Wales Government in the preparation of Bills urgently required, it was
not found possible to draft the proposed measure until quite recently. Copies of the
Bill have now, however, been sent to all States, and the matter has been listed for further
discussion at the forthcoming Conference. (8.18/1829.)
PROHIBITION OF MANUFACTURE OF WAX MATCHES.
Resolved :—That the New South Wales Government be requested to make further inquiries
into this matter, and, if necessary, bring it before a later Conference.
Further inquiries having been made, it was represented that to prohibit the
manufacture in any or all States would be futile so long as importation of wax matches
was permitted by the Commonwealth law.
8


In these circumstances, the New South Wales Government decided not to press
the matter further, and informed the Premiers of other States to that effect. This
course was unanimously agreed to. (A.20/966.)
MINOR PREFERENCE IN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT TO
REJECTED VOLUNTEERS.
Resolved : —That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Public Service Commissioners of the
various States should, in dealing with candidates for Government employment, not overlook
the fact of such candidates having in good faith volunteered for active military service.
The foregoing resolution was communicated to the several States and in due
course replies were received that the principle indicated had been adopted by all of
them. (8.19/3736.)
SUPPRESSION OF SALE OF GOODS IN TRANSIT PROM EUROPE
(AND ELSEWHERE) TO AUSTRALIA.
Resolved ; —That, in response to the general invitation thrown out by the Prime Minister at the
recent Recruiting Conference at Melbourne to make proposals for the further control of
profiteering, this Conference would draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to
the alleged practice of the sale of goods during transit from overseas, and the consequent
inflation of prices in Australia, with a view to inquiry, and, if justified, to its suppression or
regulation.
On 31st July, 1918, the Commonwealth Government amended Prices Regulations
under the War Precautions Act 1914-15, in such manner as to prevent the continuance
of practices complained of in the resolution of the Conference. (8.18/1833.)
RECIPROCAL RECOGNITION OF COMMONWEALTH LEGAL PRACTITIONERS
IN STATE COURTS AND STATES’ LEGAL PRACTITIONERS IN COMMON-
WEALTH COURTS.
Resolved :—The Attorneys-General of the various States be asked to take the question into
favourable consideration.
The following action has been recorded : —-
NEW SOUTH WALES .. A rule of the Supreme Court promulgated on Bth May, 1919, provides
that^
(a) The Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth or any Deputy
or Assistant Crown Solicitor ;
( b) - Any person employed in any law office of the Common-
wealth who has been admitted as a Barrister and
Solicitor of the High Court of Australia under Statutory
Rules, 1908, No. 25 or any amendment thereof ;
shall in their official capacity be entitled to practise as Solicitors
in any of the Courts of this State, and when so practising shall
be entitled to all the rights and privileges and subject to all the
liabilities of a Solicitor of this State.
VICTORIA .. Is in accord with the views of the Chief Justice of New South Wales.
The Council of Legal Education made Rules to meet the case, but
added a reservation that the service of articles in a Commonwealth
Office must be with a Victorian Barrister and Solicitor.
QUEENSLAND .. .. Is prepared to accept the recommendation of the High Court Judges
on the matter.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA .. Is “ not prepared to go further in the matter of reciprocity than is
indicated in the Rule promulgated by the Judges of the Supreme
Court of New South Wales dated Bth May, 1919.”
WESTERN AUSTRALIA .. The Barristers’ Board is “ opposed to granting any concession in this
State which will enable law officers of the Commonwealth who
may have been admitted as Commonwealth practitioners under
Statutory Rule No. 35 or any amendment thereof to practise as
such in the Courts of Western Australia in their official capacity.”
The Board added that “ the necessity for such a concession does
not exist in this State.”
TASMANIA .. .. Tasmania considers provision should be made to grant reciprocity to
practitioners admitted to the High Court of Australia, but what-
ever action is taken should be uniform throughout the States.
(8.19/790.)
9


UNIFORM SECRET COMMISSIONS ACT.
Resolved :—That it is desirable that uniform secret commissions laws should be passed by the
States.
The following action has been recorded :
NEW SOUTH WALES .. An Act was passed by Parliament in November, 1919 —•
Copies of the Bill as drafted were circulated to all States on 23rd May,
1919.
VICTORIA .. .. No need for fresh legislation. The New South Wales Bill is practically
identical.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA .. There are ample provisions in the Criminal Code of the State, and the
Attorney-General does not see any necessity to alter same.
TASMANIA .. .. No action has been reported.
QUEENSLAND .. .. Bill not yet introduced, but may be considered next session.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA .. Bill will be introduced next session. (A.19/665.)
PAYMENT TO STATES FOR LEGAL WORK PERFORMED FOR THE
COMMONWEALTH.
TESTING OF LEGAL RIGHTS OP COMMONWEALTH TO STATE
JUDGES 5 SERVICES IN COMPENSATION CASES.
Resolved :
That the Commonwealth Government be invited to consider the question of payment to the
States of the expenses incurred by the States in connexion with the administration of
justice in respect of the laws of the Commonwealth.
That if the necessity of testing the powers of the Commonwealth over State officers should
arise (State Judges’ services in compensation cases) joint action will be taken by the
States to test the question in the Courts.
Although, only the former of these two resolutions was conveyed to the Acting
Prime Minister they have been treated together to a very great extent in the
correspondence with the -States, more particularly from the aspect of the demands
of the Commonwealth on State Judges’ services, not only in compensation cases but
in other capacities.
The first resolution was brought under the notice of the Prime Minister on
13th June, 1918, and on many occasions subsequently, but up to date none of these
communications has elicited any reply, so that the matter has been practically at a
standstill since the holding of the Conference.
With respect to the second resolution, it might be interesting to note that in
January, 1919, His Honour Judge Docker, of the New South Wales District Court,
expressed doubt as to whether Regulation 113 of the Seamen’s Compensation Act 1918
was not ultra vines. This view was conveyed to the Acting Prime Minister, supported
by the opinion of the Attorney-General that Regulation 113, if valid, merely confers
authority but does not impose an obligation upon a District Court Judge to act as an
arbitrator, and further, that the case is not one in which the Commonwealth Parliament
has invested a State Court with Federal jurisdiction. At the same time the attention
of the Acting Prime Minister was invited to the first-mentioned resolution (above)
and to the opinions which had been expressed from time to time at various Conferences
that the States and the Commonwealth should work on the principle of “ pay and be
paid ”in respect of services rendered. It was claimed that if State judicial officers are
to continue to perform extra-judicial services of an onerous character for the Common-
wealth Government, then the State should be recouped the value of such services. The
concurrence of the Commonwealth Government in this view was sought, but, as
previously intimated, no reply has been received in spite of repeated reminders.
(A.20/62.)
UNIFORMITY IN REMISSION OF TAXATION IN CASES OF SOLDIERS
ON ACTIVE SERVICE.
Resolved :—That pensions granted in respect of active service with military or naval forces be
exempt from income tax.
The resolution having been communicated on 28th May, 1918, to the
Governments of the Commonwealth and of the several States, reports were received
as follows
COMMONWEALTH .. Pensions exempted as from Ist July, 1916.
NEW SOUTH WALES .. Payment of the tax has not been enforced, and it is not proposed to
enforce it.
10


VICTORIA .. .. The Government is of opinion that inclusion of provision for exemption
in the new uniform Income Tax Bill will settle the matter.
QUEENSLAND .. .. War pensions are not taxable.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA .. Soldiers’ pensions are not taxable in this State.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA .. War pensions were exempt by the Land and Income Tax Assessment
Act 1918.
TASMANIA .. .. Provision made in amending Land and Income Tax Acts 1918 and
1919, for exemption of every pension under Commonwealth War
Pensions Act from State taxation, and the incomes of unmarried
soldiers under £157. These Acts also allow for a reduction of
£lOO on incomes of £157 and over. Married soldiers’ incomes
under £2Ol exempt, and incomes in excess of this amount are
subject to a deduction of £156 with an allowance from tax payable
of 6s. for each child under 16 years of age, in cases in which the
income is under £350. (A.19/837.)
STOPPAGE OP PAYMENT OP DUTY ON STATE IMPORTATIONS.
Resolved :—-That consideration of this matter be deferred until the larger question arising out
of the expiration of the Surplus Revenue Act, providing for the payment of 255. per capita
to the States, is being dealt with.
It was anticipated that this question would have been considered at the
Conference of Treasurers in July, 1918, but this was not done, and no further action has
been taken. (8.18/1901.)
RECOMMENDATIONS OF HARBOR TRUST OFFICIALS CONFERENCE, 1916.
Resolved ;—That the respective State Governments consider the recommendations of the first
Inter-State Harbor Conference of 1916, and exchange views as to how far they are prepared
to adopt such recommendations, with a view to arriving at unifomity as far as possible.
The Sydney Harbor Trust Commissioners suggested that the matter was not
one that was appropriate for settlement by a Conference of Premiers, but rather for
each Port Authority to bring under the notice of its own 'Government. This view
was adopted by the New South Wales Government, and communicated to the Premiers
of the other States, who concurred in the proposal that the matter should be removed
from the list of subjects for future consideration by the Conference of Premiers.
(A. 19/602.)
UNIFORM ELECTORAL LAWS, FEDERAL AND STATE - AMALGAMATION
OF ELECTORAL OFFICES.
Resolved ;—That the Federal Minister be asked to supply the States Governments, confiden-
tially, with copies of the Electoral Bill now in preparation, and before introduction.
Copies of the Commonwealth Electoral Act No. 27 of 1918 were circulated by
the Prime Minister on sth December, 1918. The Prime Minister, at the same time,
invited attention to the fact that—
. . the provisions of the Act, insofar as they relate to electoral registration and matters incidental
thereto, have been so designed that when the necessary State legislation has been passed full effect
can be given by a formal arrangement and regulations to the recommendations of the Joint Electoral
Conference held in Sydney in July, 1915, under the administrative system successfully followed in
Tasmania since the year 1909. (A. 19/237).
BRITISH EMPIRE ORDER.
Resolved That this Conference, while recognising that the bestowal of honours in recognition
of war services is a matter for the decision of the Federal Government, is strongly of opinion :
1. That in such cases the State Governments should not be asked to accept the responsi-
bility of making nominations ;
2. That where the State Governments are requested to make nominations, such
nominations should be made in the accepted constitutional manner through the
Governors of the States ;
3. That where the State Governments are requested to make nominations, no
nominations should be invited from persons or associations/who do not share
the responsibilities of Government.
The resolution was communicated to the Governments of the several States
with a suggestion that in each case His Excellency the Governor of the State should be
invited to communicate the views of the Conference to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies. This course was adopted in each instance, (A.19/1251.)
11


GUARANTEE TO WHEAT-GROWERS FOR 1918-19 AND 1919-20 CROPS.
Resolved :
That, subject to the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States retaining control
of the wheat scheme and of the responsibility therefor, this Conference recommends
that the wheat-growers of 1918-19 and 1919-20 be guaranteed 4s. 4d. per bushel, from
point of delivery, except in the case of New South Wales, where the arrangements already
announced should be adopted.
That the manner and the amount of payment for wheat delivered and the allocation of
responsibility between Commonwealth and States shall be the subject of yearly
negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States concerned.
The resolution was communicated to the Acting Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth, who advised that, at the meeting of the Australian Wheat Board held on 7th
June, 1918, it was agreed that there should be a guarantee of 4s. 4d. per bushel, less
freight from point of delivery, in respect of the 1918-19 wheat crop.
It is understood that this was agreed to by all the wheat-growing States with
the exception of New South Wales, which had already guaranteed 4s. per bushel f.o.r.
country railway stations.
The responsibility for the guarantee for the 1918-19 wheat was allocated as
follows :■ —
To the States —3s. plus all charges, inclusive of handling charges, freight,
administration expenses, interest, and any other costs due to losses by
weevil or through mouse and/or any other damage.
Equally between the State (in each State) and the Commonwealth—the
difference between 4s. 4d., less freight, and 3s.
With regard to the 1919-20 crop, the Commonwealth Government suggested in
the first instance that the guarantee should be fixed at the same figurp as for the previous
year, but, in view of the drought and the threatened shortage of wheat supplies, it
was subsequently decided that the guarantee should be increased to ss. per bushel
f.o.r. country station, and that the responsibility for the additional amount should be
borne equally between each State Government concerned and the Commonwealth
Government.
The question of the relation between the States in respect to the wheat guarantees
which had been given was discussed at the Conference of Commonwealth and State
Ministers in January, 1919, when the following resolution was adopted
Resolved -.—That tbe Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the four wheat-
growing States, namely, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia,
agree that action be taken as follows :
1. The Commonwealth to immediately pass a regulation authorizing the Prime
Minister to —
(a) Enter into an agreement with the banks in relation to wheat finance.
(b) Give to the banks a guarantee that each State Government will repay
advances.
(c) Arrange with representatives of the State for the undertaking by the Com-
monwealth of a proportion of the liability in respect of advances made
by the banks.
2. The States of New South Wales and South Australia to pass legislation authorizing
the State Governments to arrange for guaranteeing of advances.
3. The States of Victoria and Western Australia to forthwith enter a formal agreement
to repay to the Commonwealth any moneys paid by it on behalf of the States in
respect of wheat, and the States of New South Wales and South Australia to
undertake that they will enter into such a formal agreement as soon as legally
empowered to do so.
Tbe action taken by tbe Commonwealth and tbe various States mentioned in
order to give, effect to tbe terms of this resolution is as follows :
COMMONWEALTH .. .. Wheat finances regulation passed 12th February, 1919.
NEW SOUTH WALES .. .. Bill prepared but not proceeded with before end of last session of
Parliament.
VICTORIA .. • • .. No formal agreement yet executed.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA .. .. Provision embodied in legislation passed last session for guarantee-
ing repayment of advances.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA .. .. Goverment opposed to adoption of Accountants’ report respecting
pooling of overseas sales of inferior wheat, and therefore did
not enter into any agreement altering the old method of
allocation. (A.20/356.)

LOAD-LINE REGULATIONS—CANADIAN AND FOREIGN VESSELS.
Resolved : —That this matter be referred to the Navigation Officers of each State with a view to
obtaining concerted action by correspondence.
Correspondence which was exchanged with respect to the resolution made it
apparent that most of the States were of the opinion that, in view of the pending
proclamation of the Commonwealth Navigation Act, it would not be necessary or
advisable to amend existing legislation to provide for the proposed uniformity.
It is understood that the Federal Navigation Act gives the Commonwealth
ample powers to issue regulations relating to load-lines. ' The Prime Minister advised,
however, on sth May, 1919, that the preparation of the regulations and the
organization of the branch would occupy much time, and that it would be quite
eighteen months before the Commonwealth Government would be in a position to
take over control. (A.20/756.)
DELIMITATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE POWERS IN THE MATTER OF
INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION.
Resolved :
1. That this Conference affirms the desirability of defining the industrial matters which
should with advantage be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
Arbitration Court, and those that should be regarded as within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the State Industrial Courts.
2. That the defining of the respective matters mentioned above be referred to a Conference
of Ministers of Industry and Labour (Commonwealth and State) to be held at a
date to be hereafter determined.
It was found impossible to convene a Conference of Ministers of Industry and
Labour, as suggested, but the matter was considered at a Conference of Treasurers
and other Ministers held in July, 1918. At the conclusion of that Conference the
Acting Prime Minister undertook to confer with his colleagues with a view to setting
out what he considered would be a working proposition. Several communications
were addressed to the Acting Prime Minister reminding him of his undertaking, but
without result.
Members of the Conference are aware that the question of the extension of the
powers of the Commonwealth in the industrial field was submitted to a referendum
of the electors of the Commonwealth in December, 1919, and that the Prime Minister’s
proposals were negatived. (A.19/1745.)
UNIFORM EXAMINATIONS AND CERTIFICATES FOR ENGINE-DRIVERS
AND BOILER ATTENDANTS, UNIFORM TESTS AND METHODS FOR
INSPECTION OF BOILERS, AND A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF MARKING
CONDEMNED BOILERS.
Resolved ;—That this Conference invites the representatives of the State Governments to
consider the matter of the uniform examination of and certificates for engine-drivers and
boiler attendants, and uniform tests and methods for inspection of boilers, and a uniformsystem
of marking condemned boilers, and that the matter be listed for consideration at the Conference
to be held in Melbourne.
In accordance with the resolution the matter was further discussed at the
Conference of Treasurers and other Ministers, held in Melbourne in July, 1918, and the
Treasurer of Queensland undertook to prepare a draft Bill for the consideration of
other States.
The draft Bill was duly prepared and circulated amongst the States in October,
1918. After some correspondence it was decided that the best way to achieve uniformity
would be to convene a Conference of Chief Inspectors of Machinery, or officials acting
in a similar capacity, to discuss the draft Bill and suggest any amendments thought
desirable. This Conference took place in Sydney in December, 1919, and a copy of
the Report, together with an amended draft of a uniform Bill, was forwarded to each
State on 12th January, 1920.
The matter has beer* listed for further consideration at the next Conference of
Premiers. (A.20/165.)
13


WORLD’S PRESS CONGRESS.
Resolved That this Conference appreciates the importance of the meeting in Sydney, as soon
after the war as may be convenient, of the Press Congress of the World, and the
Governments will co-operate with the Press of their respective States in the arrangements
necessary for the proper reception of the delegates from overseas, and for making available
to them information appertaining to Australia.
The Congress has been convened to meet at Sydney in October, 1920, and the
necessary organization is now in progress throughout the Commonwealth. (8.20/512.)
UNIFORMITY OF INCOME-TAX LAWS, RETURNS, ETC.
Resolved :—That a copy of the report of the Sub-committee appointed to inquire into this question
be forwarded to the Acting Prime Minister.
At a later stage of the proceedings it was decided that this question should be
further discussed at the Conference of Treasurers which the Acting Prime Minister
proposed to convene. As members know, this Conference took place in July, 1918,
when it was resolved :
(a) That the officers be requested to prepare a return suitable for the Commonwealth and each
particular State. Six returns.
(b) With a view to the use of a uniform income-tax return by taxpayers, the State Treasurers
agree to recommend to their respective Governments that a measure be introduced adopting
the principles of the Commissioners’ Draft Bill.
(c) That Mr. Holman and Mr. Theodore be appointed a Sub-committee to consider and report
upon the proposal to create one collecting authority for the direct taxes of the Common-
wealth and the States.
Following upon the last-mentioned of these resolutions, a scheme was drawn
up by Mr. Holman and Mr. Theodore and circulated among the States. After some
correspondence, the matter was again discussed at the Conference held in Melbourne
in January, 1919. No finality was reached, however, as the Acting Prime Minister
intimated that he had just seen the report for the first time and was not in a position
to discuss it. The report was merely received and no further action taken.
Since January, 1919, attempts have been made to arrive by correspondence
at some basis by which uniformity might be secured, but the attempts have been
unsuccessful. It was therefore thought advisable to convene a further Conference of
Taxation Officials to meet just prior to, or at the same time as, the next Conference of
Premiers. (A.20/148.)
INSPECTION OF MEAT FOR EXPORT.
This matter was not on the Agenda for the Conference, nor was any specific
resolution adopted respecting it. The New South Wales Government, however, took
advantage of the presence of the Acting Prime Minister and another Commonwealth
Minister at the Conference to bring under their notice the fact that a considerable
amount of overlapping was occurring in connexion with the inspection of meat for
export.
At the conclusion of the discussion the Honorable L. E. Groom undertook to
make representations to the Federal Minister controlling the inspection. This was
done, and on the 14th August, 1918, the Acting Prime Minister set out fully the views
of his Government on the question at issue. This statement, copy of which was forwarded
to all States, indicated plainly that the Commonwealth Government was not prepared
to recede from the position which it had taken up. In view of this attitude the matter
has not been further pursued. (A.19/382.)
CONFERENCE OF MINISTERS OF AGRICULTURE, MAY, 1918.
Prior to the Conference of Premiers a Conference of Ministers of Agriculture
of the various States was held in Sydney in May, 1918, to consider questions relating
to the encroachment by the Commonwealth Government on the functions of the States’
Departments of Agriculture.
The following resolutions were adopted :
(1) This Conference is satisfied that the assumption of examination and grading of dairy produce
by the Federal Government is against the interests of the industry throughout the Common-
wealth, inasmuch as it has and will seriously interfere with the systems of education carried
out by the States, greatly increases cost by duplication of staffs, makes for confusion of
effort, harasses trade, and is likely to result in deterioration of quality of product without
providing any compensating advantages.
14


(2) That the regulations which have been framed under the War Precautions Act relating to local
and inter-State trade in dairy produce are quite unnecessary, outside the intentions of
the Act, and should be repealed.
(3) The States are willing to undertake the examination of all export dairy produce without direct
cost to the Commonwealth, provided they are permitted to collect fees not exceeding Id.
per cwt. or part thereof in the case of butter, and Id. per crate for cheese, these rates being
half the present Commonwealth charge to the producers.
(4) That the sale of the dairy produce of Australia in the European or other markets, other than
sales to the Imperial Government of butter in respect of which the Federal Government has
undertaken the responsibility of finance, should be negotiated through the Agents-General
and not by the Commonwealth Government.
(5) That in view of the fact that dairymen are undoubtedly restricting their operations to that
period of the year when they can rely upon the natural pastures, this Conference is of opinion
that if price is to be continued during the war by the Commonwealth Government the
additional price fixed during the winter months should be such as to permit of profitable
production over that period.
(6) That the Honorable the Permiers will request the Commonwealth Government to cease the
procedure at present being carried out whereby unnecessary expenditure is being incurred
in the assumption of functions by the Commonwealth which are at present being efficiently
performed by the States.
The foregoing resolutions and the memoranda which accompanied them were
presented to the Conference of Premiers by the New South Wales Minister of
Agriculture, and were subsequently discussed with the Acting Prime Minister of the
Commonwealth and his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs.
After discussion the Minister for Trade and Customs undertook to place the
whole matter before the Federal Cabinet for consideration of the question of holding
a Conference between the responsible officers of the Commonwealth and the State
Departments of Agriculture.
On 14th August, 1918, the Acting Prime Minister forwarded a detailed reply
to the memorandum presented by the Minister of Agriculture, and intimated that it
had been decided that the Federal control of dairy produce should be continued. A
copy of this letter was forwarded to all States on 22nd August, 1918.
On 11th September, 1918, the Acting Prime Minister advised that a proclamation
had been issued under the Customs Act, prohibiting the exportation of butter from
the Commonwealth unless it had first been graded by an officer of Customs in accordance
with the provisions set out in the proclamation. At the same time he advised that
Commerce Regulation No. 21, in terms of which the inspection and marking by State
Officers might be accepted under certain circumstances, had been cancelled.
Since the date mentioned above numerous protests have been addressed to the
Commonwealth Government by the New South Wales Government, but the former
refuses to recede from the position it has taken up.
With respect to resolution No. 4, members of Conference will remember that the
Agents-General have carried on a lengthy correspondence with the High Commissioner
on the question of the sale of primary products in the London markets, and that,
moreover, the State Governments have addressed memoranda to the respective State
Governors protesting against the continued interference by the Commonwealth
Government in the legitimate trading functions of the State Governments. Up to
date no finality has been reached as a result of the representations which have been
made. (8.19/885.)
CONFERENCE OF TREASURERS AND OTHER MINISTERS WITH ACTING
COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTER, 17th to 20th JULY, 1918.
At this Conference the following matters were dealt with :
FINANCE.
It was resolved that —
“In the unanimous opinion of the Treasurers at this Conference the ordinary aggregate
expenditure of all Commonwealth and State Departments should not be further increased
during the war.”
There was no correspondence with regard to this resolution, and therefore no
report is possible as to the action which was taken in each State to give effect to it.
15


INCOME TAXATION.
UNIFORM INCOME-TAX RETURNS.
COLLECTION OF TAXES BY ONE AUTHORITY.
It was resolved that —
(o) The officers be requested to prepare a return suitable for tbe Commonwealth and each
particular State —six returns.
(b) With a view to the use of a uniform income-tax return by taxpayers, the State Treasurers
agree to recommend to their respective Governments that a measure be introduced adopting
the principles of the Commissioners’ draft Bill.
(c) Mr. Holman and Mr. Theodore be appointed a sub-committee to consider and report upon
the proposal to create one collecting authority for the direct taxes of the Commonwealth
and the States.
These resolutions have already been dealt with, see page 17 (Uniformity of Income-
tax Laws, Returns, &c.).
IMMIGRATION.
It was decided that-r-
Tf the States intended to make representations to the Imperial Government in regard to the
Emigration Bill, the Commonwealth would do so through the High Commissioner.
No report is necessary in regard to this item. (A.19/460.)
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION.
It was decided that this matter should be referred for discussion at a later
Conference, the Acting Prime Minister to submit to the States an amended proposition.
For report of subsequent action, see page 15 (Delimitation of Federal and State powers in the matter
of Industrial Arbitration).
OVERLAPPING OF FEDERAL AND STATE SERVICES.
Resolved : — That this Conference is of opinion that a Commission representing the Common-
wealth and the States should be appointed to report upon existing duplication of services
and activities, with a view to the elimination of overlapping of functons.
This resolution was adopted after discussion of the matter with the Acting Prime
Minister of the Commonwealth, who concurred in its terms. The attention of the
Commonwealth Government has been drawn to the resolution on many occasions, but
up to date no action has been taken in the direction of appointing the proposed
Commission. (8.19/516.)
COAL POOL.
It was resolved that—
“ Having heard the statement from Admiral Sir William Clarkson, this meeting of Delegates
is of opinion that the proposed Coal Board is unnecessary, and that the difficulty raised by the Victorian
State Government, we respectfully suggest, is a matter upon which that Government might approach
the Commonwealth Government with the view of making such arrangements as may be necessary
for improving the methods of handling shipped coal.”
This matter has already been dealt with, see page 6 (Proposed Formation of a
Transportation Board).
£18,000,000 LOAN FROM THE COMMONWEALTH.
This matter was discussed, but no resolution adopted. At the suggestion of the
Acting Prime Minister it was allowed to stand over indefinitely.
MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCE FOR OLD-AGE PENSIONERS IN
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
The increased payments suggested by the Commonwealth were agreed to.
For General Report on this matter see page 3 (Payment to Old-age Pensioners
in State Hospitals and Charitable Institutions).
COMPARATIVE SALARIES PAID BY COMMONWEALTH AND STATES
TO CIVIL SERVANTS.
It was decided to refer this matter to a Commission to be appointed, see page 5
(Comparative Salaries paid by Commonwealth and States to Civil Servants).
16


LIFE-PASSES OVER RAILWAYS.
The resolution, of the Premiers’ Conference, May, 1918, was adopted as a
recommendation to the Commonwealth.
This matter has already been dealt with, see page 7 (Recognition of Life Railway
Passes issued to Federal and State Ministers).
FRENCH MISSION.
It was decided that the Commonwealth should communicate with the State
setting out the proposed arrangements, the Commonwealth to pay the living expense
of the mission while in Australia, and the States to provide railway passes and take
charge of the mission while in the State.
It is understood that the expenses of the Commission were defrayed on the basis
above suggested.
RAILWAY CHARGES FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO DEFENCE
DEPARTMENT.
Resolveo.— That Railway Commissioners and representatives of Commonwealth confer on
question and agree to uniform rate. Ail matters relating to the transport of soldiers inwards
and outwards, and within the State, to be referred to the Conference,
In accordance with the above recommendation a Conference of Railway
Commissioners was held in Melbourne on 19th and 20th November, 1918, at which the
rates and fares paid by the Commonwealth to the State were revised.
A copy of the Railway Commissioners’ Report was forwarded to each State on
the 6th January, 1919. (A.19/92.)
ENGINE-DRIVERS’ CERTIFICATES.
Mr. Theodore was requested to draft a Bill for submission to all States.
For subsequent action see page 16 (Uniform Examinations and Certificates for Engine-drivers, Boiler
Attendants, &c.).
CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE MINISTERS,
MELBOURNE, 22nd to 27th JANUARY, 1919.
The matters discussed at this Conference, and the action taken in respect of
same, are as follow :
REPATRIATION.
(a) Works programmes of Commonwealth and State Governments.
(b) Soldier Land Settlement.
It was resolved,-
That the question of soldier land settlement, the public works programmes of the States
calculated to facilitate the employment or settlement of soldiers, and the financial problems associated
therewith, be referred for consideration and report to a Sub-Conference of the Commonwealth Ministers
for Repatriation and Works and the State Ministers for Lands and Works.
Subsequently the Sub-Conference referred to above presented the following
report: —
In accordance with the terms of the motion passed at the Conference, the Sub-Conference of
Commonwealth Repatriation, and Works and Railways Ministers, and State Lands and Works Ministers,
met at 10 a.m. on Friday, 24th January, 1919, and the next day, and the following are the resolutions
passed during its sittings :
1. “ That upon all moneys advanced by the Commonwealth to the States for the purpose of land
settlement and the construction of works specially to aid in repatriation, the Commonwealth
should charge the States on the moneys advanced a rate of interest 1 per cent, less than
that paid by the Commonwealth in raising the moneys.”
2. “ That the total amount to be advanced by the Commonwealth to the States to be provided as
advances to soldier settlers shall not exceed an average of £625 per settler.”
3. “ That preference to returned soldiers suitable for the work be granted upon all undertakings
to be constructed in aid of repatriation.”
4. “ That the Commonwealth be asked to make available for each State the amount of money
necessary for advances for soldiers’ settlements, and the necessary public works in aid of
land repatriation, on the basis of the quota of men enlisted from each State, leaving for
further consideration the question of the Commonwealth advancing further assistance should
it become apparent that the quota in any State will be exceeded.”
5. “ That this Sub-Conference recommends the acceptance of the offer contained in the letter of
2nd December, 1918, by the Acting Prime Minister to the State Premiers regarding advances
to local authorities, subject to satisfactory terms being arranged, and that the State
Governments be requested to undertake to facilitate any necessary action in this direction.”

The recommendations of the Sub-Committee were considered seriatim by the
Conference, and the following resolutions were adopted in substitution for No. 1 :
Resolved: —
That any form of relief to be granted by the Commonwealth to the States to recoup loss should
be distributed during the first five years of the loan.
That in order to partially recoup the States for losses necessarily incurred in connexion with
land repatriation, the Commonwealth shall, during the first five years, pay to each State
a subsidy at the rate of £27,500 per annum for each £1,000,000 advanced.
On the 2nd June, 1919, the Acting Prime Minister advised that the last-mentioned
resolution had received the consideration of the Commonwealth Government, and that
his Government was willing to place the following provisions in a formal agreement
which it was intended to submit for the approval of the several Governments : —-
{a) That the States be charged on loans for land settlement for soldiers a rate corresponding to
the cost of the money to the Commonwealth—that rate on any advance to be reduced,
however, during the first five years of its currency by 2| per cent, per annum.
(h) That the concession set out in the foregoing sub-paragraph (a) is an enlargement of the original
concession under which the Commonwealth became responsible for half the loss incurred
by the States in granting loans to soldiers at less than cost; that, therefore, the amount
of the original concession will not be paid in addition to that which is set out in sub-
paragraph (a), and that the enlarged concession is granted on the understanding that the
soldier settlers will continue to receive from the States the benefit of reduced interest, as
set out in resolution 9 of the Conference held in Melbourne in February, 1916.
(c) That the concession of 2| per cent, for five years be allowed in respect of all past and future
advances made by the Commonwealth to the States for land settlement, including resump-
tions and public works. The concession will not be given on the amount of bonds issued by
the States for resumption of land.
At the same time the Acting Prime Minister offered to retain the moneys
represented by the enlarged concession, to place same in Trust Fund, and to allow
interest at current rates thereon. The States would have the right to claim payment
from this Trust Fund up to the amount of their losses on giving three months’ notice,
and, at the end of five years, would be entitled to draw the balance.
* Under a Schedule subsequently presented by the Premier of Tasmania, the requirements of that State for Public Works outside of land
Settlement for themest three years are £2,310,000.


The second recommendation of the Sub-Committee with respect to the amount
to be provided as an advance to soldier settlers was subsequently accepted by the
Commonwealth Government.
The principle referred to in Recommendation No. 3 in respect of preference
to returned soldiers on repatriation works is, it is understood, being adopted in all
States.
The Commonwealth has also adopted the fourth recommendation of the
Sub-Committee with respect to the basis on which amounts are to be advanced, namely,
the quota of men enlisted from each State.
The matter referred to in the fifth recommendation of the Sub-Committee had
already formed the subject of correspondence between the Commonwealth and State
Governments, but, having had no advice from the other States, I am unable to say
whether the recommendation was generally adopted.
The Acting Prime Minister intimated on several occasions that he proposed
to submit for the consideration of the States a draft agreement embodying the
arrangements which had been made between the States and the Commonwealth in
respect of soldier settlement, but up to date the draft has not come to hand.
(A.20/1168.)
WHEAT FINANCE, INCLUDING QUESTION OF COMMONWEALTH AND
STATE LEGISLATION COVERING ADVANCES AND OVERDRAFTS.
Resolved :—The Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the four wheat-growing
States, namely, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, agree
that action be taken as follows ;
1. The Commonwealth to immediately pass a regulation authorizing the Prime Minister
to—
(a) enter into an agreement with the banks in relation to wheat finance ;
(b) give the banks a guarantee that each State Government will repay advances ;
(c) arrange with representatives of the States for the undertaking by the
Commonwealth of a proportion of the liability in respect of advances
made by the banks.
2. The States of New South Wales and South Australia to pass legislation authorizing
the State Government to arrange for guaranteeing repayment of advances.
3. The States of Western Australia and Victoria to forthwith enter into a formal agree-
ment to repay to the Commonwealth any moneys paid by it on behalf of the
States in respect of wheat, and the States of New South Wales and South Australia
to undertake that they will enter into such a formal agreement as soon as legally
empowered to do so.
This matter has already been dealt with, see page 14 (Guarantee to Wheat-growers
for 1918-19 and 1919-20 crops).
THE WAR-COMMONWEALTH INDEMNITY.
Resolved :—That, in the opinion of the Premiers and Ministers now sitting in Conference, the
Commonwealth is justly entitled to be indemnified by the en&my countries the monetary
costs the people of Australia have to bear by reason of the war.
This resolution was conveyed to the Acting Prime Minister. No report in regard
thereto is necessary.
SETTLEMENT OF BRITISH EX-SOLDIERS ON THE LAND IN AUSTRALIA.
The Acting Prime Minister placed certain information relating to the proposed
British Soldiers’ Settlement in Australia before the Conference. His proposals were
discussed, but no resolution was adopted.
No correspondence has passed between the States on the question, but I
understand that the position in all the States is the same as in New South Wales, that
is, that the duty of providing, first of all, for the re-settlement of Australian soldiers
has precluded any definite steps being taken to attract British soldiers to the Common-
wealth. In any case, the shortage of shipping has proved an effective bar to the
encouragement of such immigration on any large scale.
ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE AT THE EXPIRATION OF THE
OPERATION OF THE COMMONWEALTH SURPLUS REVENUE
ACT 1910.
The Acting Prime Minister intimated that the Commonwealth proposed at
the expiration of the operations of the Act, that a reduction of 2s. 6d. per capita should
be made annually from the amount paid to the States, commencing Ist July, 1920,
for a period of six years, until the total reduction amounted to 15s. per capita, and
further, that the balance of 10s. per capita should operate for a period of five years,
after which arrangements should be reconsidered.
19


No resolution was passed respecting this matter, but the representatives of
the States entered an emphatic protest against the proposal.
The Acting Prime Minister intimated, however, that he did not see that the
proposal could be altered and that, in view of the financial obligations of the Common-
wealth, some re-adjustment must be made.
CO-ORDINATION OF COMMONWEALTH, STATE, AND OTHER PUBLIC
BORROWING.
In connexion with this proposal, the Acting Prime Minister suggested that the
whole of the States should place their borrowing in the hands of the Commonwealth
for a period of three years. Representatives of New South Wales and|Yictoria
intimated that they did not agree to this proposal, and the Acting Prime^Minister
thereupon said that he would be prepared to conduct negotiations with individual
States.
ELIMINATION OP SAVINGS BANK COMPETITION.
The Acting Prime Minister intimated that the Commonwealth Government
was willing to submit to the Federal Parliament an amendment of the Bank Act to
provide for the amalgamation of the Commonwealth and State Savings Banks, and
read a memorandum setting out his proposals.
Although the matter was fully discussed by members of the Conference no
finality was reached, nor was - any resolution passed in relation thereto. As in the
case of the previous item, the Acting Prime Minister intimated his willingness to conduct
negotiations with individual States. (A.20/1261.)
UNIFORM COMMONWEALTH AND STATE TAXATION LAWS AND/OR
COLLECTION BY ONE AUTHORITY.
Although this matter was discussed, no specific resolution was passed. The
action taken in regard thereto is reported on page 17. (Uniformity of Income-Tax
Laws, Returns, &c.)

Although this item was on the Agenda, time did not permit of its discussion
by the full Conference, but the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways
interviewed the State Ministers concerned. The report of this interview is not, however,
embodied in the general Conference Report, and I am, therefore, unable to say what
arrangement was made. (A.20/404.)
CO-ORDINATION OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE POWERS WITH
RESPECT TO QUARANTINABLE AND OTHER DISEASES.
The Acting Prime Minister read a memorandum setting forth certain proposals
for co-ordination between the States and Commonwealth in matters affecting the public
health.
As the representatives had not previously been informed of the proposals,
the matter was not discussed, but subsequently the memorandum was circulated amongst
the States and their opinion asked, with the following result:—
NEW SOUTH WALES .. .. Considers that the Commonwealth proposals should be accepted,
as there are many directions in which co-ordination of the
public health efforts of the several States and of the Common-
wealth is' desirable, and even essential, in order to obtain
satisfactory results.
VICTORIA .. .. .. Has notified the Prime Minister that it concurs in the proposals,
an( l is prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth authorities
QUEENSLAND .. .. .. Has advised the Commonwealth Government that the proposals
are agreed to, provided the scheme would avoid any clashing
with the State authorities.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA .. .. Has informed, the Prime Minister that the scheme in question is
acceptable to that Government.
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.. .. Has intimated its agreement in the proposals of the Commonwealth
Government.
TASMANIA .. .. .. No action has begn reported. (A. 20/208.).

BREAK OF GAUGE PROBLEM IN CONNEXION
WITH AUSTRALIAN RAILWAYS.
The break of gauge and how to remedy it is about the most important railway problem
at present before the people of Australia. With a view of assisting in consideration of the matter,
I have had the annexed statement compiled, and hope that it may be found useful in dealing
with this great question, which, from the points of view of defence, trade, and welfare of the
people of the Commonwealth, is every year becoming more important.

Minister of State for Commonwealth Works and Railways.

Melbourne, 15th May, 1920.
BREAKS OF GAUGE IN THE RAILWAY SYSTEMS OF AUSTRALIA.
There are 22,046 miles of Government railways on the mainland of Australia.
Of this mileage, 5,149 is to the 5 ft. 3 in., 5,881 to 4 ft. 8-|- in., 10,866 to 3 ft. 6 in., and 150
to a smaller gauge.
The varying gauges have become a grave problem. They seriously affect Inter-State trade
and commerce. They are a very serious disability from a military point of view.
The railways seem to have been built without thought of the future. They were built
without regard to neighbouring States. They were built to serve the purpose of the day.
Through the varying gauges and impediments in Inter-State connexion, they serve mainly
local or State requirements. They do not form a network of railways promoting the welfare of
Australia as a whole.
By their very differences they tend to self-contained and compartment systems. They keep
evergreen the State boundaries ; they do not create or foster a federal spirit.
They represent an enormous capital expenditure, but they are not the asset to Australia
in peace, nor would they be the asset in the time of war, that the cost should warrant.
The railways, constructed as they are, are regarded by our military authorities as so slow
and cumbersome that as an operation of war they cannot be seriously regarded.
In the language of the late Lord Kitchener, our railway lines appear to be more favorable
to an enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country.
EARLY HISTORY.
The railways first opened in Australia were—
Although, the Sydney-Parramatta section is shown third, its construction probably marked
the first railway building in Australia.
When the pioneer lines in Australia were constructed, the selection of the gauge in each
instance was probably controlled by the then geographical, financial, and economic considerations.
They started hundreds of miles from Colony boundaries, and the distance seemed to blur the vision
and the interchange between States was not then apparent.
The fatal mistake was the selection of different gauges by New South Wales and Victoria.


Knibbs’ Official Year Book No. 1 shows—
In 1846, Mr. Gladstone, then Colonial Secretary, recommended in a despatch to the Governor of New South
Wales that the 4 ft. 'in. gauge should be adopted. In 1850, however, the engineer to the Sydney Railroad and
Tramway Company strongly advocated the adoption of the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, and in 1852 an Act was passed making
it compulsory that all railways in New South Wales should be constructed to the wider gauge, the Governors of Victoria
and South Australia being duly advised of the step that had been taken. Butin 1852 the company mentioned having
changed their Engineer, also changed their views as to the gauge question, and in the following year they succeeded
in obtaining the repeal of the Act of 1852 and in passing another, under the provisions of which the narrower gauge
was made imperative. This step was taken without the concurrence of the other States concerned, and a considerable
amount of ill-feeling arose, especially in Victoria, where two private companies had already placed large orders for
rolling-stock constructed to the broad gauge originally chosen. The result was that it was decided in Victoria to adhere
to the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge as the standard gauge for that State, while the Sydney Railroad and Tramway Company proceeded
with the construction of their lines to the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge, and these two gauges have since been adhered to as the
standard gauges of the respective States.
The South Australian Government adopted the 5 ft. 3 in., but later selected 3 ft. 6 in, as
the gauge for railways in the northern portion of the State. Queensland and Western Australia,
however, from the outset adopted the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge.
Whatever may be laid to the early administrators, there is now one clear duty to those in
■control —to remedy the mistake of the past.
COMPARED WITH GREAT BRITAIN AND AMERICA.
The experience of Australia was the experience of both Great Britain and America.
Australia’s lack of foresight is a case of history repeating itself.
Both Great Britain and America laid their early lines to serve the early day and generation.
They built varying gauges, and the time came when they had to face the problem Australia is
asked to face to-day.
The trouble of the gauges was agitating administrators in Great Britain as far back as
1846.-
In that year a Royal Commission on the gauges reported
In the earlier period of the railway history of this country, the great trunk lines were so far separated as to he
independent of each other, and, as it were, isolated in their respective districts, and no diversity of gauge was then
likely to interfere with the personal convenience, or the commercial objects of the community ; but now that railways
are spreading in all directions, and becoming interlaced with each other in numerous places, that isolation is removed,
that independence has ceased, and the time has arrived when, if steps cannot be taken to remove the existing evil of the
diversity of gauge, at least it appears to us imperative that a wider spread of this evil should be prevented. Uniformity
of gauge is now a matter much to be desired.
This uniformity was secured in 1870 to 1872, when the whole of the gauges were converted
to 4 ft. 8£ in.
Similarly in the United States—they built their railways without regard to the future, and
in 1886 there were at least seven different gauges in the States. In that year a uniform gauge-
4 ft. 8J in.—was adopted, and at least 13,000 miles of main line were converted.
From that time the United States have had a national system of railways, allowing of free
and unrestricted communication throughout the length and breadth of the country, irrespective
of differences in ownership or of State boundaries.
E. A. Pratt, an authority on railways, says—
This uniformity of railway gauge has, in fact, been a most important factor in rendering the United States still
more united than they would otherwise have been. It knit west, north, and south still more closely to the east, and made
the different States feel that they really constituted part aud parcel of one and the same nation.
The railway companies of Great Britain, and of the United States, though starting with
differing gauges, long since adopted uniformity.
Australia has failed to show a like enterprise in providing a really international railway
system, serving Australia as a whole, breaking barriers between the States, and linking all by a
uniform railway system.
EFFORTS TO SECURE UNIFORMITY.
Two years after the first railway was built in the colony, Mr. John Whitton, then Engineer-
in-Chief of the New South Wales Railways, recommended that before the rails met at the Murray
River, the railways in that State be converted so as to insure uniformity with Victoria. His
recommendation was not adopted.
9618.— 10


Shortly after his arrival in Sydney, the late E. M. 6. Eddy, then Chief Commissioner for
Railways, invited the late Sir Henry Parkes’ attention to the urgent need for unification between
New South Wales and Victoria. His letter of 18th May, 1889, reads —■
With reference to what has recently passed on this subject, and our conversation yesterday, I have the honour
to suggest that the following should be the basis of procedure in connexion with this subject;—
That the various Colonies should affirm—■
1. That the adoption of a universal gauge is absolutely necessary, looking at the future growth of the country
and the annually increasing intercourse of the people and exchange of goods.
2; That the cost of adopting a uniform gauge shall be borne by the whole of the Colonies affected.
3. That it having been decided that the cost of altering the railways to a uniform gauge shall be a national
one, this subject of which is the right gauge to be adopted must be approached without any bias in
favour of the gauge at present in operation in any Colony, and a decision must be come to from the
stand-point of which gauge—4 ft. 8J in. or 5 ft. 3 in.—can be adopted at the least cost and incon-
venience.
4. That it shall be an instruction that the whole of the railways in New South Wales, Victoria, that part of
the railways of South Australia now laid to the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge, as well as the line to Cockburn (fot
Silverton), and all lines in Queensland south of Brisbane leading to New South Wales, shall be altered
. to the standard gauge, and the cost of altering the railway and the rolling-stock necessary for working
such lines shall be a national charge.
6. That the Chief Commissioner or Chairman of the Railway Board in each Colony, with one colleague (to
be selected by the Chief Commissioner or Chairman), to be a Commission to consider—
(l) What shall be the gauge of the future.
(2) In what proportions the cost of the change shall be borne by the respective Colonies.
(3) The probable cost of carrying out the change.
(4) The number of years the cost of th« change shall be spread o ?er, and the amount of money
set aside each year as a sinking fund.
(5) The date on which the change of gauge shall take place.
The Commission to submit a joint report for the consideration and approval of the respective
Governments.
That it be a recommendation to each of the Colonies finding it desirable for the present to make narrow-gauge
lines in Outlying districts to arrange its stations, tunnels, and bridges in such a way as to enable the uniform gauge
at a later date to be laid down without incurring any additional expenditure in enlarging such works ; the wisdom,
however, of from the outset adopting the standard gauge, which may be laid down in the cheapest possible way, to be
carefully considered.
The late Mr. Eddy’s suggestions, although so timely and of such great importance, do not
appear to have been acted upon. Apparently the question remained dormant until the meeting
of the Federal Convention in Adelaide in April of 1897, when, as the result of representations made,
the Premiers of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia remitted the matter
for consideration of the respective Railway Commissioners of the three States named.
In August, 1897, the Railway Commissioners in conference in Melbourne resolved—
The Commissioners, in view of the contemplated Federation of the Australian Colonies, and the desirability
of providing the utmost facility for inter-communication, are impressed with the necessity of having as soon as possible
a uniform gauge.
They strongly favoured the adoption of the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge throughout New South Wales,
Victoria, and South Australia. Reports and estimates were submitted, and the Commissioners
advised the conversion could be made throughout the three States within a period of five years.
{See Parliamentary Paper 48 of 1913, page 9.)
In May, 1899, the Railway Commissioners of Australia in conference in Brisbane resolved—
In future any new work to be carried out on the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge should be designed so as to be easily adapted
to the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge.
From that year all car and waggon axles ordered for the Victorian Railways were designed
to such dimensions that they could be readily converted to the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge. Arrangements
were also made for the fire-boxes of “ DD ” and “ DDE ” locomotives in the Victorian Railways
service to be so arranged that they could be altered to suit the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge.
In February, 1911, the War Railway Council in Melbourne resolved —
In the interests of defence, this War Railway Council affirms the desirability, as regards the main lines of
communication, of a uniform gauge for the railways of Australia.
In January, 1912, the Premiers’ Conference in Melbourne resolved —
That a committee of the leading railway engineers of the Commonwealth and States be appointed to investigate
the question of the selection of a uniform gauge between the capital States of Australia.
The Committee representative of the Commonwealth and each of the State railway systems
met in Melbourne for several days, and submitted comprehensive reports and estimates—dated
7th December, 1912, and 11th April, 1913. {See Parliamentary Papers 67 of 1912 and 48 of
1913.)


This Committee recommended—
1. The adoption of a standard 4 ft. 8| in. gauge for Australia’ for the following reasons
{a) There would be a saving of expense at every break of gauge.
(b) The comfort and convenience of passengers would be enhanced.
(c) It would be imperative in connexion with military movements should they at any time become necessary.
( d) It would lend encouragement to traffic, as it would facilitate the transfer of goods and passengers ; and
(e) It would tend to reduce the total quantity of rolling-stock required for railway purposes in Australia. ,
2. The conversion of the whole of the Australian railways.
In concluding their report, the Committee said—
Our Report will show clearly and forcibly the desirability of adopting a standard gauge at once
■and carrying out the work of conversion as soon as possible.
In March, 1914, the Premiers’ Conference in Melbourne resolved—
That the States agree to refer to the Inter-State Commission the question of a uniform railway gauge for Australia
for report whether it is desirable,to adopt a uniform railway gauge, and if so, when, and what gauge should be adopted.
The resolution was received by the Inter-State Commission, who advised the only way
in which the matter could be properly dealt with by them was to have it referred by resolution
of either House of Parliament.
In November, 1914, at the Premiers’ Conference in Melbourne, Mr. Fisher said —
Hie Commonwealth Government was strongly in favour of a uniform railway gauge throughout Australia, and
was prepared to go a long way in the matter of raising the money. This question had been discussed ever since Federation
and nothing tangible had yet been done. Since the last Conference the matter had become more urgent from a defence
point of view. Failing an agreement on the question of unification, he asked the States to consider an alternative
proposal to give the Commonwealth power and facilities to construct a strategic railway to connect Adelaide and
Brisbane, but taking a more direct route inland. This route would be much safer from a defence point of view, and
would shorten the distance between the centres very considerably. It had been advocated by the military experts.
He asked what co-operation would the States afford the Commonwealth in the matter of Grown lands if it constructed
the line.
At this Conference it was resolved —
To refer to the War Railway Council for consideration and report—
(l) The proposal of the Chief of the General Staff and the Bngineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways
to construct a railway for strategic purposes.
(2) To consider how far the purposes sought to be therein achieved can be secured by utilizing the Stats
railway systems.
(3) Without prejudice to the strategic value of the railway, to take into consideration its possibilities for
commercial and developmental purposes.
In November, 1914, the War Railway Council in Melbourne submitted a number of
resolutions dealing with the question of strategic railways.
In May, 1915, the Premiers’ Conference in Sydney resolved —
That in the opinion of this Conference a Commission of two leading railway experts, preferably from outside
Australia, should be forthwith appointed by the Governments of the Commonwealth and the mainland States to
report, and advise upon the question of unifying the gauge of Australian railways.
This proposal was not adopted.
In October, 1915, the War Railway Council in Sydney resolved—
That the most important railway improvement from a military stand-point would be the unification of the
gauges ...
With all the Conferences, the Special Councils, and Committees, matters remain as they
were.
The mixed gauges still exist, strategic lines have not been built, and the practical solution
of the difficulty seems as far removed as when the proposals were instituted in 1897 —23 years
since.
EXPEDIENTS TO AVOIDJALTERATION OP THE GAUGES.
The thought that some device would be submitted or some expedient would be
forthcoming which would solve the problem without the very heavy expense of altering the
gauges no doubt has contributed to the delay.
Device after device has been submitted, but no suggestion, no invention meets the trouble.
In September, 1898, the Railway Commissioners of Australia in Conference in Sydney,
resolved —
It was deemed necessary, in view of the repeated efforts made to obtain the sanction of the various Governments
to the introduction of mechanical appliances for the purpose of transferring vehicles from one gauge to another, to
express most emphatically that such contrivances, many of which have been tried and discarded elsewhere, should
never be adopted even in an experimental form.


In May, 1901, at a Conference in Melbourne, they resolved—
The Commissioners are of opinion that a mixed gauge on a running line is not desirable.
The third rail operating in conjunction with Brennan compound switches was discussed!
at the Premiers’ Conference in Sydney, May, 1915; Adelaide, May, 1916 ; and Sydney, May, 1918.
Them after was referred to a Board of Experts consisting of the Chief Mechanical Engineers
and Way and Works Engineers from each railway system of the States and the Commonwealth.
This Board sat in Melbourne in August, 1918, but, after full consideration and examination
of the roads laid at Tocumwal, the proposal was unanimously rejected.
The experts regarded all third-rail suggestions as—
So limited in range of usefulness that they could not recommend adoption ; they were of opinion the third rail:
was only a poor expedient which would tend to complications and prevent a more complete and effective system beings
introduced.
The Board examined and exhaustively dealt with no less than 126 inventions, devices, &c.,
embracing sliding wheels, double and multiple wheels, telescopic and divided axles, adjustable
bogie frames, changing bogies, transference of bodies, treble or multiple rails.
They, however, arrived at the unanimous conclusion that none oould be accepted.
The proposals for overcoming the break of gauge are as old as the railways themselves.
In Great Britain, dating as far back as 1846, Gauge Commissioners examined different-
devices, strange to say, similar in many respects to those brought forward in Melbourne before the
1918 Conference, and reported that, on the score of danger and inapplicability, the consideration
of such expediencies should be abandoned.
Their report reads—
We sum up our conclusions by stating our belief that no method has been proposed to us which is calculated 1 ,
to remedy in any important degree the inconvenience attending a break of gauge.
They furthermore reported in respect of the third-rail principle—
We consider that the general adoption of such a system ought not to be permitted.
These conclusions, although given so many years back, coincide with the views of modern
railway experts.
In America certain devices were in operation prior to the introduction of the uniform gauge,
but they did not meet the case. One writer says —
By the year 1886 there were some eight or nine different gauges in operation, with the result that the use of a.
company’s rolling-stock was too often restricted to its own lines, while the employment of certain mechanical
arrangements for overcoming this difficulty by removing a waggon from one set of bogie trucks to another on a different
line was far from satisfactory. It became evident, in fact, that the American railways, though owned by various-
companies, would, both in their own interests and in those of the country require to adopt uniformity of gauge, thus
securing physical connexion of one line with another, and allowing of through traffic in all directions with the same-
rolling-stock.
One looks in vain for any recommendation from railway engineers or commissioners that-
these devices be used.
No railway engineer or commissioner charged with the responsibility of carrying passengers
day and night over and through busy yards, over mountain sections, at high speeds would
recommend any device that would admit of movable axles, car bodies, adjustable switches, &c.
The whole of the expert evidence shows there can be no temporizing. Uniformity of gauge-
is the solution of the question.
EFFECTS OF THE BREAK OF GAUGE.
Trade and Commerce. —The break of gauge is generally denounced as a commercial evil of
the first magnitude.
As far back as 1846 in Great Britain it was regarded as —
An evil which would alone neutralize half the benefits of the railways system.
In 1866 a memorial, signed by a large number of manufacturers, merchants, colliery owners,
and others, was addressed to the directors of the Great Western Railway, from which the following;
is an extract; —
The transfer of goods is expensive, tedious, entailing, moreover, constant delay in delivery, grievous disappoint-
ment, consequent annoyance, and often serious loss to both consignor and consignee ; and as regards the staple of this
district, viz., coal, such transfer (involving not only the expense of the operation, but the loss arising from depreciation
and breakage) becomes positively prohibitive.
If in those days such a memorial was required, much more is it needed to-day.
Only a few days since, the Victorian Railways Commissioners announced that one firm
alone had ordered truck space for 3,415 tons of fodder between Melbourne and Sydney —and at-
tire time there were fully 800 fully-loaded trucks of fodder at Albury, or on the way there.


The Commissioners also announced that, although the congestion of the coal siding at Albury
was not so pronounced, nevertheless “ over 1,000 tons of coal was loaded at that centre yesterday.”
One can imagine the enormous work of transhipment, under existing system, the delay
to traffic, the damage in transhipment. One can also readily imagine the ease, the facility with
which the hundreds, the thousands of trucks could be readily transported between Melbourne
and Sydney with a uniform gauge.
The benefits in time of drought in removing stock, in conveying fodder, vegetables, &c.,
would be immeasurable.
Great as is the cost of transhipment, it is a mistake to measure the disadvantages of a
break of gauge from this stand-point, nor by the loss incurred by damage, &c., in transhipment.
There are losses of a more substantial character not readily seen.
Dealing with this subject, Mr. Grierson, at one time General Manager of the Great Western
Railway (England), said —
Although during a portion of the year the traffic is tolerably regular, at other times it is fluctuating, and it is
therefore frequently found that when this fluctuation arises, or when the traffic has to be carried over distances, sometimes
short and sometimes long, it is impracticable to provide the rolling-stock with regularity, notwithstanding the large amount
of stock owned by the company, which is largely supplemented by private persons, and the transfer station becomes blocked ;
uncertainty, delay, and loss is thereby caused, and a check is given to progress and development, whereby the interests
of the district, the company, and the traders suffer.
Sir Frederick Upcott, when Chairman of the Indian Board of Railways, when dealing with
the differing gauge trouble in India, said—
The railway administration has been unable to grapple with the great congestion of traffic. The want of unifor-
mity renders it impossible to draft the rolling-stock of one railway to another of different gauge, to meet those periods of
stringency so common in India, owing to abnormal or deficient rainfall, flood, famine, sudden glut of traffic, concentration of
troops, and other causes.
Uniformity of gauge would allow of an interchange of trucks according to the requirements
of the States. Such an arrangement would facilitate operations. It would also reduce working
expenditure. It would effect a saving of capital expenditure on rolling-stock, since under a system
of interchange of waggons, there would no longer be the same necessity for each State to provide
fully for times of abnormal pressure.
MILITARY.
The late Lord Kitchener, in his report of 7th July, 1910, said —
Page 3, clause 11. —I would also mention that railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted
in lines that would appear to be more favorable to an enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country. Different
gauges in most of the States isolate each system, and the want of systematic interior connexion makes the present lines
running inland of little use for defence, though possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would have temporary command
of the sea.
The late Lord Roberts, in speaking to a meeting of eminent engineers in London in 1914,
in advocating the abolition of breaks of gauge in India, referred to an experience whilst he was in
control of troops in India. At that time there was under consideration a question as to whether
a railway line should be extended from Lahore on the broad gauge prevailing to that point or to
the narrow metre gauge. He said—
He worked out the question by assuming that a serious disturbance had broken out on the North-west frontier,
and that it was necessary to collect at and despatch from Lahore 10,000 men of all arms to Rawal Pindi, 171 miles,
beyond which it was not then intended to take the railway. He was able to prove that by continuing the broad gauge
the 10,000 men, with guns, norses, tents, baggage, &c. ; could be assembled at Kawal Pindi in four days and five hours
after the first detachment had reached Lahore, but that with the narrow gague, involving transhipment at Lahore,
it would occupy thirteen and a half days.
Sir Guilford L. Molesworth, at one time Consulting Engineer for State Railways to the
Government of India, speaking at the same meeting, said —
The difficulties which a break of gauge would entail on troops pressing rapidly on to the frontier would be very
great, as the work of transfer would have to go on day and night; stores would be mixed, broken, and lost; the men
would be harassed, horses injured, and the delays would be very great.
Dealing with his own experiences Sir Guilford said that at one time he was ordered to go
to a break of gauge point during the Afghan War to inquire into the delay in getting troops and
munitions forward. Concerning this, he says —
On my arrival there I found that the picture was more than realized ; an enormous area of land, many acres
in extent, was crowded with military stores, carts, baggage, tents, and war materials of every description, piled one on
another in the utmost confusion. Sixteen trains a day were arriving, each train adding to the confusion.
Lord Roberts’ recommendations led to a complete change of policy. The Punjab-Northern
Railway, and the Indus Valley Railway, each built to the metre gauge were converted. The
change of policy included the alteration of more than 1,000 miles of railway, and all frontier lines
have since been made on the standard broad gauge.
9618.— 11


Sir Guilford says—
Lord Roberts, by bis vigorous protest, has earned the gratitude of India by saving the frontier from disaster
that might have been the result of a break of gauge between its frontier and all the important systems of the rest of
India. His victory for the frontier railways will probably exert a more lasting effect on the future destinies of India
than even his most brilliant military successes.
At a War Railway Council meeting in Melbourne, in November, 1914, it was resolved that
a military service of transporting troops and munitions that under existing conditions took 63
days, could if the three gauges were unified to 4 ft. 8| in. be accomplished in 23 days, or a saving
of 40 days.
Our military authorities throughout condemn the present break of gauge. They regard
it as a grave hindrance. They recommend unification of the gauge between the capitals as a
first consideration—in their own words—“ the paramount question from a military point of view
is unquestionably the unification of the gauge.”
THE STANDARD GAUGE TO BE ADOPTED.
The 4 ft. 8-1, in. gauge is the gauge of Great Britain, of the United States, of France, and of
Germany ; it is recognised as the world’s standard.
Strange though it may seem, it is the gauge selected by George Stevenson, and was adopted
on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was opened in 1830.
The Railway Commissioners of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia in 1897
recommended the conversion of the 5 ft. 3 in. to 4 ft. 8| in. gauge. Their Report read ;
In view of the great difference in cost of conversion, the Commissioners are strongly of opinion that the 4 ft. 8£ in
gauge should be adopted in lieu of the 5 ft. 3 in.
At a Conference of Commissioners in Brisbane in 1899, they resolved that —
Any new work on the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge should be so designed as to be easily adapted to the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge.
In 1903 the Engineers-in-Chief of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western
Australia, recommended the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge for the Trans-Australian Railway. Their Report
reads—
We have, after careful consideration of the whole question, no hesitation in stating that the standard gauge
of 4 ft. in. should be adopted.
In 1913 the Engineers-in-Chief of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western
Australia, Queensland, and the Commonwealth Railways, recommended the adoption of the
4 ft. 8J in. gauge.
In 1911 the Railway War Council recommended the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge for the Trans-Australian
Railway, and a similar gauge linking up the capitals between Brisbane and Fremantle.
In 1915 the Council again affirmed the principle of the 4 ft. 8-| in. gauge, and recommended
that the connexion between the Northern Territory and Southern States should be to that gauge.
Overwhelming evidence favours the 4 ft. 8| in. standard.
PREPARATIONS FOR THE CHANGE.
Concerning the conversion in America it is said by a reliable authority that—
In the summer of 1885 it was decided to adopt the 4 ft. 8|- in. gauge and to convert all railways to this gauge at
the end of May in the following year. The change was made, and 13,000 miles of main lines and 1,500 miles of siding
were converted to the 4 ft. 8J in, gauge, and, incredible though it may appear, the operation was carried out in just
two days.
The necessity for uniformity was foreseen, and for years all engines, carriages, and waggons,
&c., had been built to facilitate the change.
The two main factors in assisting the conversion were— '
(a) The universal adoption of central fixed couplings without side buffers ; and
(b) The bogie truck which was detached from the body of the car and the gauge of
which was capable of expansion or contraction by easy expedients without
interference with or being interfered with by the body.
Australia, however, is not so prepared, the railways have not been under uniform control,
and there has been no defined policy of preparation for the change.
Some measure of preparation has, however, been adopted.
As mentioned on page 3, the Australian Railway Commissioners in conference in Brisbane
in May, 1899, resolved that—
In future any new work to be carried out on the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge should be designed so as to be easily adapted
to the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge ;
and in Victoria since 1899
All carriage and wagon axles have been designed so that the wheels can be pushed on the axles to the extent
of the difference between the 5 ft. 3 in. and the 4 ft. 8J in. gauge, and the fire boxes of certain classes of locomotives
have been arranged so as to facilitate alteration without interfering with the boilers.


In March, 1900, the Railways Commissioners in conference at Adelaide, resolved again—
A free interchange of plans, designs, and specifications is strongly recommended where uniformity is deemed
practicable, such as, in the case of the Locomotive Department, centre coupling, brake gear, diameters of axles, hrake
shoes, buffing gear, and other similar details, with a view to uniformity —future unification of the gauge to be always
borne in mind.
There has been no controlling authority, however, to see that the whole of the States
observed the resolutions.
Much preparatory work could have been done over the years and rendered the change
immeasurably easier.
The gauge of 4 ft. in. having been determined, and unification being so necessary, the
principles or factors for preparation should be decided upon, in regard to —
(a) Construction of new lines, bridges, tunnels, &c. ;
(b) Building of new rolling-stock.
(c) Erection of buildings, structures, &c.
(d) Alterations of existing rolling-stock, &c., and other factors as necessary.
When the principles have been determined, it should be the function of some controlling
authority to see they are given effect to.
Only by unwavering pertinacity can the railway administrators bring their roads, their
structures, and their rolling-stock into readiness for conversion when the time arrives.
WHAT CAN BE DONE AT PRESENT.
With the high rate of wages, the difficulties in obtaining, and the enormous cost of materials,
conversion at the present would be extremely costly.
The time has come, however, when the question must be faced, and the matter for
consideration is what must be done now, and what may be left undone.
The call to connect the capitals is insistent; the matter of converting the many radiating
lines can probably be deferred.
The uniform gauge is closely allied to the strategic railway question. Certain proposals
have been suggested by the War Railway Council which, if given effect to, would largely solve the
problem in so far as the uniform gauge between the capital cities is concerned, and besides assisting
strategically would help in the development of the country.
The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner in representing the matter to the Government
recently said —
It appears to me to be unnecessary to estimate for or consider at present the adoption of a uniform gauge
throughout Australia, The gauges of many of the existing lines which run from distributing centres would naturally
remain as they are for many years to come, even if the adoption of a uniform gauge was immediately decided on, and.
it would only be necessary to consider at the outset the provision of a uniform gauge connecting the capitals. This
could be accomplished by—■
(1) Connecting Kyogle and Brisbane with a 4 ft. 8| in. gauge line. This, I irnderstand, has been favorably
reported on by both New South Wales and Queensland.
(2) By building a separate 4 ft. 8J in. gauge line from Albury to Melbourne.
(3) By building a 4 ft. in. line from Hay to Port Augusta via Crystal Brook with a 4 ft. in. connexion
to Adelaide via Morgan.
(4) By altering the gauge from Kalgoorlie to Perth from 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. 8J in.
The foregoing would* in my opinion* largely do away with the present difficulties and inconvenience caused by the
varying gauges in existence throughout Australia and could be followed as funds permitted and as traffic developed
by the gradual extension of the gauge which has been adopted as the Australian standard.
To meet the Commissioner’s proposals, the existing railway from Albury to Melbourne
would either have to be converted or a new direct 4 ft.'B-| in. line provided. The railway between
Morgan and Roseworthy would also have to be converted, and a new direct 4 ft. 8| in. line provided
from there to Adelaide. The railway from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle would also require to be
converted to 4 ft. 8| in.
The Commissioner’s scheme approaches the matter from the gauge, the strategic and the
developmental point of view.
(1) The railway from Kyogle to Brisbane would provide a uniform gauge ; it would
also be a developmental railway.
(2) From Albury to Melbourne it would be a uniform gauge and a strategic railway.
(3) From Hay to Port Augusta it would be a uniform gauge, a developmental, and a
strategic railway. From Morgan to Adelaide it would be a uniform gauge ; it
would also be a strategic railway.
(4) From Kalgoorlie to Fremantle it would be a uniform gauge ; it would also be a
strategic railway.

Under these proposals the journey from Brisbane to Perth would be shortened by 469 miles,
and from Brisbane to Adelaide by 279 miles.
The proposals would give a uniform gauge between the capitals, leaving till later the
question of the radiating lines, although it would be found that once the main lines were established
conversion of the other lines, particularly in Victoria and South Australia, would soon follow.
THE EFFECTS OF DELAY.
Each year increases the trouble, renders the task more difficult, and adds largely to the
cost of conversion.
A leading daily recently said—
We should arrest, while we yet have time, the staggering growth of the cost of doing the work.
In August, 1897, the Railways Commissioners estimated the cost of converting the broad-
gauge lines of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to 4 ft. 8£ in. as £2,360,500. Sixteen
years later the Chief Railway Engineers in conference fixed the estimate for conversion in the
three States at £7,295,000, Avhilst the conversion of the whole of the railways in Australia was
estimated to cost £37,164,000. {See Parliamentary Paper, No. 48 of 1913.)
Since 1913, there has been much development, and the cost—particularly with the higher
cost of wages and material—would be very much higher to-day.
Since 1897, when the first estimate was submitted many railways have been built, and
there has been phenomenal growth of traffic.
The details are as shown in an appendix enclosed, of which the following is a summary :
The Sydney Morning Herald in a recent article said—
We should not forget that every foot of track laid down anywhere in Australia aggravates the existing anomaly
due to the break of gauge, and makes the task of unification bigger and more costly.
In 1886, when America unified the gauges, 13,000 miles of railway were converted.
In 1916 there were approximately 300,000 miles of railway, and over 390,000 miles including
all tracks controlled by the railway companies of the United States.
One cannot conceive what the position would have been had America delayed conversion,
nor can it be measured how difficult the problem will become in Australia if the position is not
soon resolutely faced.
Australia stands at the portals of a new era—the war is over; industries are beirnr
established; trade between the States is growing; railways are being used more than ever, and
are carrying and will continue to carry traffic that at one time was sea-borne ; population is
turning Australia-wards ; and even within the next few years the railways will be asked to carry
infinitely more traffic than has ever yet been offered.

In view of the great difference in cost, the Commissioners are strongly of opinion that the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge should
be adopted-in lieu of the 5 ft. 3 in. as being the most economical method of securing the end aimed at.
If the Governments of the respective Colonies determine to take steps towards the unification of the gauges,
the Commissioners suggest that all new rolling-stock should be constructed with that object in view.

APPENDIX 2.
EXTRACT FROM REPORT, DATED 11TH APRIL, 1913, BY THE ENGINEERS-IN-CHIEF OF THE
COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES.
The estimated cost of the conversion of all the 4 ft. 8| in. and 3 ft. 6 in. gauge lines in New South Wales,
Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia to a uniform gauge of 5 ft. 3 in. amounts to £51,659,000, while
that of the conversion of all the 5 ft. 3 in.,and 3 ft. 6 in. lines to a uniform gauge of 4 ft. 8J in. is £37,164,000,
showing a difference in favour of conversion to 4 ft. 8J in. of £14,495,000.
Dealing only with the 4 ft. 8| in. and 5 ft. 3 in. gauges in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, the
estimated cost to convert the 4 ft. 8J in. in New South Wales to 5 ft. 3 in. is £19,319,000; while the conversion of the
5 ft. 3 in. gauge in Victoria and South Australia to 4 ft. 8£ in. is estimated at £7,295,000 —a difference in those States
only in favour of the 4 ft. 8£ in. of £12,024,000.
As our estimates indicate that the cost of conversion would be very greatly in favour of a 4 ft. 8|- in. gauge, we
recommend the adoption of that gauge as the standard for Australia.
The estimated cost of conversion of all lines in the several States to the standard gauge recommended is as
under

Victoria .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 6,117,000

Commonwealth ~ .. ... .. ~ .. .. 1,281,000
Total .. .. .. .. .. .. 37,164,000
During the discussion, it became apparent that the furnishing of an estimate of the cost of conversion of the
connecting lines between the capitals only to a uniform gauge would be valueless, as this is a course which could not
be adopted in any State where “ conversion ” is necessary owing to the very serious difficulties in working which would
be involved, and the high cost of transhipment of an ever-growing traffic.
As an alternative to “ conversion,” it would be practicable to connect up Brisbane with the New South Wales
system by a standard gauge line running in a southerly direction to join at Kyogle or Murwillumbah.
In the same connexion Western Australia has agreed to construct a standard gauge line (a portion of which has
already been authorized by Act of Parliament) to connect Fremantle and Perth with the Commonwealth line at
Kalgoorlie.
In South Australia, while “ conversion ” of the broad-gauge lines would, if supplemented by a direct standard
gauge line between Port Augusta and Adelaide, provide for a uniform gauge between the capitals, there are isolated
lines, the alteration of which will not be needed until their connexion with the main lines becomes necessary, and there
are also some spur lines which may without difficulty be left over for future consideration.
The following is an estimate of the expenditure involved in carrying out the limited scheme above described ;
£
Western Australia—New line, Fremantle to Kalgoorlie .. .. .. 2,777,000
South Australia —New direct line, Adelaide to Port Augusta .. ~ 1,170,000.

Queensland and New South Wales connexions, 100 miles, rough estimate without
survey .. . . .. . . . , .. .. . . 900,000
Total .. .. .. .. .. .. 12,142,000
In the year 1897, officers of the South Australian, Victorian, and New South Wales railways met under instructions
and prepared estimates of the cost of conversion of the 5 ft. 3 in. gauge in Victoria and South Australia to a standard
gauge of 4 ft. 8| in,, and also the conversion of the 4 ft. 8| in. New South Wales lines to a gauge of 5 ft. 3 in. The matter
was subsequently dealt with at a meeting of the Railways Commissioners of the States named. It will be seen from this
report that the estimated cost of conversion of the 4 ft. 8| in. gauge lines in New South Wales in 1897 to a gauge of
5 ft. 3 in., including alterations to rolling-stock, amounted to £4,260,000, whereas, at the present time, the cost of the
same work is estimated at £19,319,000.
It was also estimated that the cost of converting the 6 ft. 3 in. gauge lines in Victoria and South Australia to
the 4 ft. 8| in. would amount to £2,360,500, while to-day this work is estimated at £7,295,000.
These figures indicate how r rapidly the cost of conversion is increasing. In view of the enormous differences
which are shown, it might at first be thought that either the figures furnished originally or those now given might
contain some inaccuracies. We, however, wish to point out that, as far as New South Wales is concerned, the track
mileage is nearly double that which existed in 1897, and there is a'ton mileage of traffic approximately three and a quarter
times that which was carried in 1897, which enormous increases, together with the fact that wages have risen to a figure
at least 50 per cent, higher, and that the cost of some materials (which form a very important part of the proposed
alteration) has increased by fully 150 per cent., warrant our statement that the estimates for this particular work are

not inconsistent*with one another. Similar remarks could be applied to the States of Victoria, South Australia, where,
during the fifteen years which have elapsed since the earlier estimates were framed, traffic is two and a half times what
it was ; the mileage has increased by 1,607 miles, and labour and materials are very much higher in cost. We would
point out as a further reason for the difference that a sufficient allowance was not, in our opinion, made in the earlier
estimate to provide for the cost of handling traffic at the different points of break of gauge which would occur
during the carrying out of the work.
The increase of traffic in all the States necessitates a relatively large increase in the cost of conversion of rolling-
stock to comply with the standard adopted.
