TO ALL WHO SUFFER FROM WEAK DIGESTION ! READ THIS ! Sydney, November 26.
To Messrs. E. ROW & CO., Sydney.
Some six months ago I was recommended to try your STEANE’S BITTERS for a complaint I suffered from—WEAKNESS OF THE STOMACH, and unabled to
retain any food many miuutes after partaking my meals. I became so bad at last that I almost gave up eating anything. I was induced to try then STEANE’S BITTERS. After the
first glass I found myself in better spirits. The comforting influence produced upon the stomach seemed at once to stop the sickness. I continued taking three glasses a day before
meals till I finished a bottle, after which I pronounced myself cured. I had no return of the complaint till about a week since, when I obtained another bottle, and am happy thus to
state my belief in them for all who suffer from such weakness. They are worth the guinea a bottle. Yours very truty, GEORGE HOLLEY.
The Faculty have pronounced it the Most Effectual Invigorator of the Constitution within their experience ; and celebrated
Analytical Chemists describe it as remarkably pleasant to the taste, containing about 16 per cent, of pure Alcohol, and
holding in solution a clear wholesome Vegetable Bitter, combined with a spicy Aromatic. The disagreeable sensations that
follow an evening’s over-conviviality will be removed by an early morning dose of the AROMATIC TONIC BITTERS.
DRINK ONLY STEANE’S BITTERS! — None genuine hut those hearing the signature of the Proprietors, E. ROW & CO.
To be obtained of all Wine and Spirit Merchants throughout the colonies.
STEANE’S AROMATIC TONIC WINE
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex and children, for it raises and strengthens depressed systems without
producing a temporary excitement to be followed by greater depression. Persons suffering from loss of appetite and general
depression of spirits cannot do better than try STEANE’S AROMATIC TONIC WINE.
READ THIS REPORT ! Government Analytical Laboratory, Melbourne, April 9th, 1869,
I have examined a bottle of STEANE’S SUPERLATIVE AROMATIC TONIC WINE, manufactured by Joseph Steane & Co.,
and find it to be remarkably pleasant in flavour, containing about 16 per cent, of a very pure Alcohol, and holding in solution a clear wholesome Vegetable
Bitter, combined with a fruity spicy aroma. I consider this Bitter a very superior article. WM. JOHNSON, Government Analytical Chemist.
STEANE’S SUPERLATIVE AROMATIC TONIC WINE has weaned many from the excessive use of Ardent Spirits.
To be obtained of all Wine and Spirit Merchants.

QUEEN’S BIRTHDAY, HAY 24, 1880,
be long remembered by the numerous band of happy, genial and highly pleased ladies and gentlemen who had the pleasure
of a trip on that truly Queen’s weather day, in the good steamship “ Kembla,” to the celebrated Broken Bay embouchure of
the famous Hawkesbury River—that river over whose beautiful scenery all travellers go with ecstacy, affirming it equal in natural
scenery and beauty to the historic Rhine. Of the many beautiful bays, coves, inlets, and headland comprising the embrasure of the
river, none can compare with the beautiful Estate of Newport, now being laid out so scientifically and liberally as a Township. The
beauty of the bay, the sloping character of the land composing hill and dale, beautifully-wooded mountains close by, valleys
abounding in beautiful ferns and other indigenous inter-tropical vegetation, margined by the placid water smooth as a mirror, luring
the rugged rocks or breaking in gentle murmurs on the white sandy beach—while a few minutes’ walk brings the visitor to the
higher hills behind the township, from which a magnificent panorama of mountain, glen,’ and course scenery are visible, namely,
Sydney Heads, the Gap, the Lighthouse, Manly Beach, Lake Narrabeen, &c. Also, to the north, all the beautiful headlands and
undulating country as far as Newcastle. Underneath the spectators’ eyes are a variety of beautiful bays, headlands, sloping glens,
valleys rising into amphitheatre formation, compared with which the tiny efforts of man at ornamentation are as a dish of water to
the mighty deep. On the east, the mighty Pacific Ocean, calm as a sleeping giant, reflecting on its dimpled face every speck of cloud,
every breath of air, every star—looking so like a sea of molten silver, that the beholder has to abandon that illusion when he sees
the deep, pulse-like throb of the tranquil ocean, “ which shows that still it lives.” Newport is, like HENRY’S COLONIAL
OINTMENT, a thing truly Australian. You must see the one to fully appreciate its beauty—you must use the other to
understand its value. The undersigned would advise every sensible father who can afford it, to purchase an allotment of land of
Mr. Pile, in the to be famed and favored watering place, Newport, and every loving mother to keep in the house ready for use
HENRY’S AUSTRALIAN WORM POWDERS, HENRY’S COLONIAL OINTMENT, and TASTELESS
VEGETABLE ANTIBILIOUS PILLS, which articles, with many more useful family remedies—the result of the inventor’s
and proprietor’s life-long experience in medicine, can be obtained from

Newport, and its neighbourhood—the subject of these pages and
the accompanying sketches—is situate at the southern extremity
of the Pittwater Lake, the first branch of the Hawkesbury ; and
is about ten miles from Manly, and half a mile from the ocean
beach, on the main road to the Government Customs Station and
Lighthouse of Barranjoey—which are near the southern head of
Broken Bay.
But a few years ago, the country beyond Manly was a terra
incognita to Sydney people; the splendid scenery, beautiful lakes,
tropical vegetation, and fine drives towards Broken Bay were not
even suspected. The enjoyable trip down the harbour was known to
all, and certainly was deservedly popular ; a residence at our new
“ Brighton ” once a year was looked forward to by most families ;
but few had ideas beyond a stroll on the ocean beach. The roads
were then very bad, and the magnificent scenery of the lower
Hawkesbury could not be viewed except by an unpleasant sea
voyage, which few people cared to encounter. It has been reserved
for our enterprising citizen, Mr. Jeanerett, to in fact bridge the
distance by establishing a line of coaches between Manly and
Pittwater ; and with his steamers plying from Newport up the
Hawkesbury, and to Brisbane Water, to bring the magnificent
scenery of the “ Rhine ” of Australia within easy reach of the
Meti’opolis.
The writer accompanied the few members of the opening trip
about six months ago. There were no coaches then on the road ;
an antidiluvian vehicle was borrowed for the occasion—and which
deserves a place in the Museum. The roads were bad, and a good
deal of “ soft sawder ” had to be used to extract permission from
the proprietor to approach the wharf, where the “ Osprey ” lay
waiting. There was no hotel to refresh the hungry travellers;
hungry they arrived, hungry they departed. Whaf little refresh-
ments they had, were procured from the steamer’s limited larder.
The travellers numbered but four.
NEWPORT.
PITTWATER AND HAWKESBURY LAKES.
Since then the traffic so humbly commenced has enormously
increased. Frequently, two or three large coaches leave Manly
filled with passengers, and the small steamer is inconveniently
crowded. The best position for a township—at the head of the
navigation—has been secured, and a township laid out. A spacious
hotel has been built, which will soon be opened. Boads have been
formed; a public school will shortly be established; and one
denomination, at least, will have a place of worship there ; —and,
probably, before long a post and telegraph office will be opened for
the convenience of the inhabitants of the large district around.
The name of the township is
The road to Newport, after leaving Manly, crosses the Curl
Curl Lagoon, on a solid embankment about twenty feet in width
and half a mile in length. It then passes along the northern side
of Curl Curl Creek for a mile or so, leaving a splendid rich country
belonging to the Bassett Harley Estate, to the left. At the
head of the Creek can be seen a range of steep hills—about six
hundred feet in heighth—clothed in vegetation to their tops. The
swamps between these hills contain a large and unfailing supply
of water at a sufficient elevation to be easily conducted by
gravitation to almost every house in Manly.
Dewhy Lagoon, a beautiful sheet of water of about 100 acres
in extent, is about four miles from the Pier Hotel, and is only
separated from the ocean by a narrow ridge of sand. This lagoon
(like other sea-side lagoons) varies greatly in size from time to
time, and like all the others its outlet is on its northern end, A
succession of easterly gales heaps up the sandy barrier, and
enables the rain waters from the mountains to increase to a great
extent, until the accumulated water, through heavy rain, becomes
too strong for the sandy barrier and bursts through to the ocean,
leaving immense quantities of fish stranded on the beach.


Long Reef, a beautiful basaltic hill right on the coast, is the
homestead of Miss Jenkins, whose family have been residents of
this locality nearly half a century. The soil here is very beautiful,
and the scenery grand beyond description, A fine vein of iron ore
is exposed on the ocean beach, but it has at present no commercial
value.
The Narrabeen Estate, the property of Mr. Wetherill, of
Sydney, extends from Long Reef to Narrabeen Lake. It was
once in cultivation, as can be seen by the plough-marks, and
produced large crops of maize. The lake is a splendid sheet of
water, generally about a mile in width, extending among
beautifully wooded hills inland for a great distance, with wide
navigable arms penetrating further into the valleys between the
mountains. It is well stocked with fish, and there are some fresh
water lagoons with abundance of silver eel. It is remarkable that
this beautiful lake, so easily accessible, is so little known. Game
abounds in the ranges to the west. As said before, fish is
abundant, and being secure from sharks, and of even depth for
long distances, it is the safest and in every sense the best place for
a long swim near Sydney. Should Mr. Wetherill subdivide his
Estate, and a good hotel be built, a new watering place will spring
up on the shores of this enchanting lake, which will speedily
become popular. The sketch herein is taken from the southern
side, at the present crossing place, which will shortly be superseded
by a bridge.
About a mile beyond Narabeen the road crosses a steep hill
from the top of which the hills beyond Newport, as well as Lord
Loftus Point, are distinctly visible, we next come to
BOLTON’S FARM,
the subject of an illustration. The soil of this locality is very
rich, and it is rather strange that it is not cultivated.
The two next sketches—
THE GREEN HILL and THE OCEAN BEACH,
are taken from where the road passes alongside a gap between two
high hills close to Newport. They represent scenery which cannot
be matched anywhere near Sydney.
Campbell’s Avenue is where the main road to Barranjoey
bounds the town of Newport. The sketch is taken from the top
of Beaconsfield-street. The cleared ground at the foot of the hill
(Mount Loftus) is Mr. Farrell’s farm. The road to Careal and
Barranjoey crosses the spur of the mountain close to the sea coast.
The town of Newport extends right from the main road to
the shore of Pittwater about half a mile. It has been laid out on
a grand scale, the allotments being mostly half an acre to three-
quarters of an acre each. The main street (the Queen’s Parade)
is one hundred and thirty-two feet in width, the other streets one
chain. The deep-water channel of Pittwater passes the property
right alongside the shore, and ends just above. The largest
steamers can lie alongside the wharf at low tide. A spacious hotel
has recently been built, the roads have been formed, and the
steamers for the Hawkesbury and Brisbane Water make it their
head quarters. Arrangements have been made to establish a
Public School. A central site has been reserved for a post and
telegraph office. A considerable trade has already sprung up, and
as it is even now the centre of a very considerable population, the
terminal point of an extensive system of river traffic, a favorite
fishing locality, and a favorite place for yachting, and being more-
over close to the ocean beach, Newport cannot fail to become very
shortly a favourite watering place, and a town of considerable
importance.
PITTWATER,
a splendid view of which can be obtained from Newport, is the
widest arm of the Hawkesbury, and the one whence the Sydney
traffic must come. It is about half a mile wide there, but below
it spreads out to a width of two miles. On the eastern shore the
country is hilly, but scarcely mountainous although Mount
Loftus rises to an altitude of over four hundred feet; but on the
western side the hills attain twice that elevation. There are
numerous inlets ; some of them extending a long way among the
hills, and which are almost strangers to the foot of man, and
doubtless abound with wallaby and other marsupials.
SCOTLAND ISLAND
is in full view from Newport, and its shores are celebrated for fine
fish ; and, across the mountains, Cowan’s Creek, the next arm of
the Hawkesbury, above Pittwater. This is a magnificent sheet of
water, extending far up almost to the head of Lane Cove, and
abounds with sport of many kinds.


MOUNT LOFTUS
is the property of Mr. Farrell, of Manly. The view from its
highest point is unsurpassed. The whole of the coast, from the
Illawarra dittrict to Tuggerah, is spread out in full view—with

LORD LOFTUS POINT
was evidently in times gone by a favorite camping ground of the
Pittwater aboriginals. It presents signs unmistakeable to old
bushmen of having been one of the head quarters of some of our
predecesssors—probably of a large tribe.
Seeing this, and looking at the immense extent of the
Hawkesbury waters, the home of so many hostile tribes, it requires
no great stretch of imagination to bring back to us from the far
gone times scenes of the conflicts between them, the many battles
which have been waged; the mighty fleets which may have
descended from the upper river, or from Brisbane Water; what
dire combats may have been fought; what mighty heroes slain—
only no historian has handed to posterity their doughty deeds.
But it is always thesame on the dawn of history, we are told—
“ Before great Agamemnon’s reign,
Reigned kings as great as he, and brave ;
Whose huge ambition’s now contained
In the small compass of a grave,
In endless night they sleep unwept, unknown ;
No bard had they to make all time their own.”
working out their destiny on their own lines. Longfellow has in
singular metre but in beautiful words placed in the mouth of his
hero Hiawatha a prophecy meant for the Redman of America, but
equally applicable to our aborigine Australians—
“ I beheld the westward marches
Of the unknown crowded nations ;
All the land was full of people—
Restless, struggling, toiling, striving.
In the woodland rang their axes,
Smoked their towns in all the valleys,
Over all the lakes and rivers
Rushed their great canoes of thunder.
Then a darker, drearier vision
Passed before me—vague and cloud-like :
I beheld our nations scattered.
All forgetful of my counsels,
Weakened, warring with each other—
Saw the remnant of our people
Sweeping westward, wild and woeful,
Like the cloud-track of a tempest,
Like the withered leaves of Autumn.”
History repeats itself. As was the history of the American
Indians, so the history of the Pittwater tribes. Formerly they
were great and numerous at Pittwater Lake, like in America at
the almost equally beautiful Lake of Saratoga; in both places they
have passed away. Now at Saratoga numberless villas, magnificent
hotels, and a prosperous town have taken the place of the Indian
wigwams. In the course of a few years, in place of the gunyahs
of the blacks, another Saratoga will arise at Newport, a far more
beautiful place, and which will be what Saratoga will never
become—the favorite sanatorium, as well as the yachting centre
of the country.
There were no special correspondents in those days, and the
traditions of the natives have not informed us whether the various
tribes maintained ambassadors at each other’s courts under the
gunyah to negotiate peace or to declare war. Nor do we know if
their wars were for plunder or conquest, or on the other side for
liberty;—and it must be remembered that there have been
numberless martyrs for liberty’s sake among the black nations ;
let Touissant I’Overture of Hayti, or the great Arabian hero,
“ Antar ” (the theme of so much Arabian poetry), bear witness—
all great nations were not of oiir race; indeed, Darwin describes
an individual as a true hero, belonging to quite a different tribe.
It is sad to comtemplate the decadence of a great nation, the
silent melting away of a numerous people, even one not civilized
as we understand the term in these advanced days, yet having the
same human affections, strivings and aspirations as ours, and
GEOLOGICAL SKETCH.
The following lines relating to the surface rocks of the
Hawkesbury are taken from the Rev. W. B. Clarke’s valuable
work on the “ Sedimentary Formations of New South Wales
“ Over the uppermost workable coal measures which are of
considerable thickness, is deposited a series of beds of sandstone,
shale and conglomerate, oftentimes concretionary in structure and
very thick bedded, varying in composition with occasional false
bedding, deeply excavated, and so forming deep ravines with lofty
escapements to the upper part of which series I have given the
name of the ‘ Hawkesbury Rocks/ owing to their great develop-




quite unnecessary. Let it suffice to say that they were, taken
altogether, as fine a lot of fellows as could be met with in a day’s
march, and they thoroughly knew how to enjoy themselves.
The party left Sydney early in the afternoon, and after the
now well-known drive from Manly, arrived at Newport before
sunset. Arrangements had been made for a shake-down at the
hotel, then unfinished, and provisions sufficient for twice their
number had been sent from Manly. Therefore, after doing full
justice to a hearty dinner and a fair supper—late to bed and early
to rise, then a substantial breakfast, the party embarked on a
pretty little steamer named the “Florrie,” at half-past seven in the
morning.
It is unnecessary to describe the trip down Pittwater, it is
so well-known, but on this occasion the channel on the western
side of Scotland Island, instead of the usual course on the eastern
side, was chosen, and the party had an opportunity to view the
pretty cottages on the western side of the bay, a pretty building,
evidently a church with tombstones around, showed that the
ordinances of religion are not forgotten there. As each point was
passed, and fresh inlets revealed, exclamations as to the beauty of the
ever-changing scenery were often simultaneously made by everyone
on board. The little steamer sped swiftly on her way to the
great River, where a disappointment was met with, for rolling
down from the mountains, covering the entire breadth of the
valley, was encountered a thick fog, completely hiding the opposite
shore; even Elliot Island in mid stream was indiscernable.
“Well,” said Brown, as the headland on the west of Pittwater
was passed, “ this is provoking ; the fog might surely have waited
another day, and left this day clear for us.” “ Bfit, what
opening is that to the left V’ said another. “ Why,” answered
Campbell, “that is Cowan Creek, which heads near Lane Cove.”
“ There is a queer superstition about Cowan Creek—or, rather,
there was when I was a boy,” remarked a quiet individual of our
party. At this moment the sun burst through the fog, revealing
for a short time some land up the broad sheet of water we were
passing. “Do you see that headland The continued. We all
looked where he indicated it was ; said he, “ whenever the moon
rose at midnight in winter, that headland is haunted by the ghost
of a man who was killed there many years ago. If you like,” he
added, as the fog has come down again, “ I will tell you the story.”
We all pressed him to begin
THE GHOST OF COWAN CREEK.
“ Many years ago, before it was anticipated that this country
could be anything else than a convict settlement, before the blue
mountains had been crossed, or railways thought of, and when both
barristers and attorneys lived lovingly together in one wigwam, there
resided not many miles from Windsor a wealthy settler. He had
received a grant of land from the Government, and, as was usual in
those days, had an assignment of men, and was allowed rations with
them. He was a violent-tempered man, but generally liked by his
servants, being withal of a generous disposition. We will call him
Thorpe, but that was not his name. ‘ About two years before the
occurrences which I am about to relate there were in a merchant’s
office in the city of London two brothers named Judd, one of whom
had just been married; the other, the younger, was very wild in
his habits, and had contracted heavy gambling debts. One day a
large sum of money was drawn from the firm’s bankers by a cheque
which proved to have been a forgery. A great commotion was made
in the office, and on search being made, the money was found in the
elder brother’s desk. He protested his ignorance as to how it came
there—it was useless. He was tried and convicted, and transported
to Australia, and assigned to Mr. Thorpe. His broken-hearted
wife realized what little property they had, and followed him to
Sydney, where she managed to engage as servant to Mrs. Thorpe.
Thus the husband and wife were living on the same farm.
“ But though so near to each other, they were not living
together, for the settler would not hear of the husband being in
the house, and the truth must be told that Mrs. Thorpe liked being
waited upon too well to allow her servant away from her much.
So poor Judd had to live among the men at the huts, and saw but
little of his wife.
“ Mr. Thorpe had a younger brother, a settler higher up the
river, who, being a single man, was frequently a visitor at his elder
brother’s house. He took a great liking to little Mrs. Judd, and
she, being of a happy disposition, and again near her husband, had
settled herself down to her altered circumstances, and was again quite
cheerful. Indeed, it must be confessed that she liked admiration,
and was proud of the attentions of the handsome young settler. I
am quite certain that she was true at heart to her unfortunate
husband ; but in a large establishment there are sure to be tale-
bearers, and the exaggerated tales of stolen interviews met his ears
almost every day.
“ He was a man of a mild, affectionate disposition, and was
known among his rough fellow-workmen according to the fashion
of those days, by a nick-name—“ The Baby,” he was called. His
whole nature seemed now to change ; the injustice of his sentence,
and now the infidelity as he thought of his wife, maddened him ;
he became moody, and violent in his conduct towards her.
They had a stormy interview one evening, and he was seen on the
farm no more, and his wife disappeared with him. It was


discovered soon after that the only boat the farm possessed had
gone also—so it was clear that they had gone down the river.
“ After two days delay a party of constables started to bring
back the runaways. They searched for them up the bays and
inlets for several days without success, and looked vainly over the
numerous islands with which the lower part of the river is studded,
nor could they glean any tidings from the blacks, and were re-
turning back again, giving up the search, when passing the mouth
of Cowan Creek some faint smoke was observed behind the pro-
montary I showed you. .They pulled up to the spot; they saw
Judd standing on some rocks with a gun levelled at them. He
fired and missed; almost at the same moment they fired at him ;
he fell shot right through the heart, and his wife rushed down
from a hut they had built and fainted on his body. They hurried
him near where he fell; no tombstone marks the spot, but it is
said that his ghost haunts the hill, and can be seen at certain times
hovering over the place.
“ His wife was taken back to the farm and soon recovered
under the kind treatment she received. She did not die them ;
oh, no ! She married again a few years afterwards, and her
descendants are numerous throughout the colony. She died about
twenty years ago.
“ Well,” said Campbell,” of all the stupid tales I have ever
heard yours is the worst; let’s have some mountain dew to wash
down this Scotch mist. 1 have some which was made a present
to me, and it is unequalled. “I ” said another,” have some which
I imported myself. I will leave the company to judge which is
the best. We then tasted the whisky and discussed it, and the
Ghost of Cowan Creek was soon forgotten.
The fog by this time quite cleared off. “ See,” said Smith,
“ look ahead.” It was indeed a beautiful view which burst upon
us. To the left, on on enchanting island with green slopes, stood
several pretty cottages, while across the river a great range of
mountains wending to the left, with bands of mist half-way up
their summits, forced the course of the river at right angles from
its former direction.
Amid scenes like this we continued our way until dinner time,
passing two neat looking churches, at which we were told a
clergyman comes all the way from Ryde to preach. At Wiseman’s
Ferry we were struck with the immense stretch of the telegraph
wires—probably, when the Hunter River traffic passed that way,
the Ferry was an important place ; the large stone church now in
ruins proves as much.
It is not attempted to describe the Hawkesbury—that task
were an impossible one, except, perhaps, for a Buchanan—nothing
but adjectives could be used, and these should be mostly superlative
words. “ Glorious,” “ magnificent,” “ grand,” “ wonderful,”
“ extraordinary,” “ this licks creation,” “ most remarkable,”
“ unsurpassed in this world,” &c.—these are fitting terms, and yet
prove quite inadequate, poetry almost equally so; even Byron, our
greatest descriptive writer, did not attempt to describe the Rhine,
how could anyone attempt the Hawkesbury ; yet in steaming up
the stream and looking at any one of the many beautiful islands,
these lines of that poet, slightly altered, flash across the mind :
Oh, that this islet were my dwelling place,
And some soft spirit for my minister ;
Then I’d forget about the coming race,
Think of no others, love but only her.
It is astonishing how you enjoy your food when travelling.
Most of the party had brought provisions, and from what one of
them had provided it seemed that he thought he had to feed the entire
party; yet the good things disappeared like magic. It is evident
that on a trip like this there is little need to nurse your appetite.
We passed a pretty church about dinner time, and saw a few
people leaving it—possibly a wedding party, all in their Sunday
clothes. What a universal thing is love, how it gladdens even
this secluded place. Scott tells us
“Love rules the court, the camp, the grove,
And men below, and saints above ;
For love is heaven and heaven is love.”
Byron, however, tells us that heaven is not love, but matri-
mony—he ought to have known, as he had the reputation of being
an authority on both sides of the question—if so, it was heaven we
saw coming out of the church, hand in hand.
After passing Wiseman’s Ferry, the country opens out and
softens ; the mountains disappear, and are succeeded by pretty
hills; numerous small farms and orchards come in view one at a
time ; and, at Kent’s Reach, where we disembark, the good
farming country commences. Suitable conveyances bowl us
swiftly along a good road to Windsor, where we stay the night.
By half-past nine next morning we are all at our offices*
thoroughly renovated by our most enjoyable trip, and capable of
such a quantity of work that, should succeeding generations know
the amount we got through during the next week, they would hold
up their hands in astonishment and exclaim—“there were giants
in those days.”


We were absent from Sydney but one afternoon, two nights
and one day ; we travelled by steamer, coach, and rail, one hundred
and fifty miles along a most picturesque route ; but on what day
we departed and on what day we returned this deponent sayeth
not.
NOTES OF A TRIP TO BRISBANE WATER
AND TERRIGAL.
From Newport to Brisbane Water the route is down Pittwater,
across the Hawkesbury, and xip the small river to Blackwall and
the Broadwater. The channel at the entrance is narrow, soon
opening out into broad sheets of water, branching in every direction.
The “ Broadwater,” which extends up to the town of Gosford, is
truly a splendid lake. The “ Kincumber” lakes join opposite
Blackwall, and there are various others. Anyone fond of
boating could spend a week comfortably among these inland waters,
and, we think, find some fair sport, both in fishing and shooting.
Gosford is but a small town, with a Court House, three churches
three hotels, two stores, and a blacksmith’s shop. The timber trade
is the principal, or rather the entire support of the place. From
what we could learn, the residents are doing very well—indeed the
appearance of everyone we met told the same tale. We did not
during our stay see a single case of apparent poverty, everyone
looked comfortably off; and further, we never saw anywhere else
so many nice-looking, clean, healthy and well-dressed children.
The wages current at the mills and in the bush is, we are informed,
two pounds per week, fully equal to three pounds in Sydney.
Horses are plentiful, and our obliging host, Mr. Campbell,
supplied us for our ride to Terrigal, which lies across the mountains
on the ocean side, about eight miles away. Our road lay for some
three miles alongside one of the navigable creeks which discharge
into the Broadwater. At various places wei’e stacks of timber
ready for shipment or being shipped, and at one place no less than
ten teams with the loads, principally laths and logs for the Sydney
mills. Some of these teams had come from places seven miles
inland. Until we were within three miles of the ocean we saw
very little growing timber of any value, the land being barren and
uninteresting ; but for the last three miles the country was splendid
and similar in appearance to the celebrated Bulli Pass—magnifi-
cent trees of great size growing alongside the track, festooned with
creepers of various kinds up to their topmost branches.
Tei’rigal is the property of Mr. Thomas Davis, and comprises
several thousand acres between the ocean beach and the coast
range of hills. Some of the land is of the richest description, and
is thickly covered with turpentine and other choice timber. The
saw mill is close to the ocean beach, and the vessels are loaded at
a small wharf, in a position very similar to Cabbage Tree Bay,
Manly. Yet Mr. Davis informed us that he has never been
prevented shipping from his wharf, even in the roughest weather.
The establishment is a very large one, employing over forty men,
and the quantity of logs sawn up so great that he has had to
construct a wooden railway—over two miles in length—from his
mill to an inland lake, to be able to work up the trees from all
round its shores.
A. great deal has been said and written about our timber
supplies, and fears are entertained that unless we have large
reserves, our foi’ests will soon be destroyed. A visit to Brisbane
Water should convince those most sceptical as to the future of the
folly of such fears—at least as far as the coast districts are
concerned. It is about thirty years ago that the large timber
trade with Gosford commenced, and already a second growth of
goodly sized trees is covering the country, to be ready in another
few years for the saw mill. In other parts of this colony we have
invariably observed a similar result. We especially remember a
large district of open forest where the few trees wei’e destroyed by
ringbarking ; —within five years afterwards the whole country was
covered by a thick growth of young saplings. The fear rather is
that this second growth will come up too thickly for any of the
trees to arrive at maturity. Of course these remarks do not apply
to our valuable red cedar, which must disappear if steps are not
taken to prevent it.
Before leaving Gosford we climbed the hill in the recreation
ground, and were well repaid for our trouble. The height, our
aneroid informed us, is a little under three hundred feet, and the
width at top about forty feet in the widest point. The view
exceeds any we have ever seen—the whole extent of Brisbane
Water, with the various bays and headlands, was spread out before
us ; far in the distance, stretching to the south, is Pittwater and
its mountains ; in the west the Hawkesbury breaks through the
hills, and right in the centre of its course is Eliot Island, like a
crouching lion with face towards the ocean, guarding the entrance
of this magnificent wilderness of waters.
It is impossible to look from the spot whore we stood without
seeing that, at a comparatively recent date, Pittwater and Brisbane
Water together formed one inland lake—a depression of the coast
—


line of about twenty feet would restore its ancient features. But
what a change that would bring about in the form of our coast.
The North Head of Port Jackson would then become an island :
four islands would be formed between Pittwater and the present
ocean ; and the western side of Pittwater would become the true
coast line.
It is quite common to hear the Hawkesbury designated as the
Rhine of Australia. Not having been privileged to visit the
river of Germany, we have not seen the resemblance. True, there
may have been many pitched battles on its banks between the
varions native tribes, as there were battles between the Romans
and the Germans on the European stream ; but if the native bards
sung of those great deeds, such songs have not been printed. We
have an account of the Rhine from our great descriptive poet: —
And peasant girls with deep blue eyes,
And hands which offer early flowers,
Walk smiling o’er this paradise.
Above the frequent feudal towers
Through green leaves lift their walls of gray,
And many a rock which steeply lowers,
And noble arch in proud decay,
Look o’er this vale of vintage bowers.
We do not think that the above will apply to our river ; in
fact the Hawkesbury is thoroughly Australian in its character and
scenery, and, besides, is like no other river in Australia, but has
a character enth’ely its own. It is unlike the Hunter on the north,
unlike the Macquarie on the west, unlike the Shoalhaven on the
south ; and from its bold romantic scenery, the great extent and
diversity of its imprisoned waters, and from its numerous branches,
it forms altogether the most wonderful estuary in New South Wales,
So much for our trip tip the Hawkesbury and Brisbane
Water ; but not even these localities, with all their charms and
beauties, comprise the importance of the Town of Newport,
It will now become the main avenue of traffic and travel with
Barranjoey, Blackwall, Gosford, Kincumber, Terrigal, Cooninburg,
Lake Macquarie, and the Juggerah Lakes, and on to Newcastle
overland, affording both to tradesmen and tourists at once con-
veniences and pleasures never before at their command. To the
one a ready and speedy access to his home, and to the other all the
delights of scenery, exploration and sport that the artist, scientist,
or holiday-maker could possibly desire.
To some of these localities it is the purpose of a few to take
trips ere many weeks go past, and we doubt not we will be able to
render as favorable an account as these given of our Hawkesbury
tour to Windsor and Brisbane Water.
