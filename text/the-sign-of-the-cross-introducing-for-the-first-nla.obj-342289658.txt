THE
WILSON BARRETT
SEASON
SATURDAY, AUGUST 17, 1901
Will be presented on a Scale of Lavish Completeness and under circumstances which should maKe the occasion a Memorable One in
the History of the Australian Stage, Wilson Barrett’s Noble Drama,
Introducing for the FIRST TKDE IN AUSTRALIA
WILSON BARRETT ** as - “Marcus**
LILLAH MCCARTHY as “Mercia **
And Wilson Barrett’s entire London Company in their Original Characters.
Public curiosity and expectation is aroused on all sides by the announcement of the forthcoming great production of Mr. Barrett’s famous play, “ The Sign
of the Cross,” in which Australian theatre-goers will have an opportunity of seeing the AUTHOR himself and the ORIGINAL LONDON CAST for the first time
in Australia. When Mr. Barrett was in Australia over three years ago strong efforts were made to induce him to include the “Sign of the
Cross ” in his repertoire; but as Mr. Williamson’s own stock company was then playing the piece in the other states, and had the scenery, costumes, &c., in
use, it was found utterly impracticable, and the idea had to be abandoned reluctantly. On this occasion, however, Mr. Barrett has taken the precaution to
bring his own complete original scenery, costumes, &c., from London, and we shall be enabled to see an exact fac simile of the London production played
under the author’s own supervision, and each character interpreted in accordance with the author’s ideal.
