GOLD AND GOLD-DIGGERS,
EVER was the excitement connected with the discovery
of any other metal so intense and so wide-spread as that
relating to Gold. Let us trace some of the extraordi-
nary phases of this excitement, and then glance rapidly
at the chief commercial results of the discoveries. But
before doing so, it may be well to notice the form or forms in which
the metal exists in the natural state.
Gold occurs sparingly in many hard rocks, such as granite, gneiss,
mica-slate, chlorite-slate, clay-slate, &c., and sometimes even in
limestone and other such rocks. It occurs far more abundantly in
quartz, pure unmixed flint, or silex. In igneous or metamorphic rocks,
the quartz usually occurs in veins, or in large, irregular bunches
or lumps, with veins diverging from them. These veins are most
commonly only a few feet wide, and for the most part traverse the
rocks in a vertical or highly inclined position. Sometimes, however,
veins or irregular masses occur many yards across in every direc-
tion ; and sometimes, but very rarely, quartz is found in such abund-
ance as to make what even might be called hills of itself. The gold
is disseminated in this quartz, sometimes in such exceedingly minute


particles as to be invisible, not only to the naked eye, but even to
the eye aided by a powerful lens. More commonly, the gold is seen
as little yellow specks, flakes, or grains scattered through the quartz.
When the quartz has a crystalline structure, which it often has, little
nests of gold, likewise crystalline, may be seen imbedded between
the interlacing crystals of the quartz. Where the interstices in the
quartz are large, these are sometimes entirely filled up with gold
and not unfrequently irregular holes and crevices seem to have been
formed' in the quartz by decomposition or rottenness, which have
sometimes been subsequently filled with gold. In such cases, the
gold often assumes irregular forms, such as melted lead will when
poured into water ?forms which have given people the idea of the
gold having been deposited in a state of fusion, a notion in all prob-
ability utterly unfounded. How the gold got into the quartz, is a
point at present so uncertain, that no man of science would take
upon himself the responsibility of answering the question. The size
of the irregular lumps thus entangled in the quartz varies greatly,,
the largest hitherto known single lump in the world being an Aus-
tralian one of 2166 ounces weight. It is,, however, usually found in
small flakes, grains, and dendritic strings, weighing only a few grains.
The last time the land of any country on the earth slowly
rose from beneath the sea, it must of course have been subject to
the degrading and destructive power of the breakers, and of the
waves and tides and currents, and all that wearing action we now
see going on on our own shores daily and hourly before our eyes-
The consequence is, that portions of every rock, large or small, have
been broken off, washed and dashed about upon beaches, or under
shallow water, rolled into pebbles, pounded into sand, or ground
down into mud and clay. These pebbles, sand, mud, and clay, have
been transported by these moving waters often to great distances
from their parent site, the largest and heaviest being generally
removed the least distance, but the finer and lighter particles swept,
sometimes tens, sometimes hundreds of miles away from the rock
they were first broken off. Such is the origin of all the mud, clay,
sand, gravel, and other loose and incoherent materials we so com-
monly find beneath the surface in all countries when we dig below
the soil, interposed between it and the main body of the solid rock*
below. Sometimes these accumulations are entirely wanting, even
over large spaces ; sometimes they are but a few inches thick, often
but a few feet; but occasionally they occur in masses 100 or 150 feet
iq thickness. They are disseminated with great irregularity, some-
times lying on the tops, or resting on the sides of hills of consider-
able elevation ; but most frequently we find them in the valleys and
in the lowest levels of a country, whither moving water would have,
of course, the greatest tendency to sweep them.
* By rock here, we mean any large regularly formed mass of earthy matter, whether it
be hard or soft.


Now, whenever the moving waters of the sea, by which these
drift-materials were thus formed and deposited, attacked rock con-
taining gold, it would of course break off lumps of it, just as of any
other rock, and equally wash, roll, and knock it about, and thus
break it up into smaller fragments, round it into pebbles, and grind
it into sand. In this way, much of the gold would be knocked out
of the rock, and much water-worn gold accumulated, or water-worn
fragments of gold and quartz together.
From this point of time, however, there is a remarkable difference
observable in the action of the water on the gold, and on rock which
contains no gold. All kinds of rock, or earth, or stone, at all events
all the common kinds, are pretty nearly of the same specific gravity
?that is to say, of the same weight, bulk for bulk. Chalk, clay,
limestone, compact sandstone, granite, marble, basalt, have all
specific gravities varying from 2 to 3 ?that is to say, they are twice
or thrice the weight of their bulk of water. Pure gold, however, has
a specific gravity of 19, or is nineteen times as heavy as its bulk of
w'ater; and the most impure ore of gold that occurs in nature has
at least a specific gravity of 12 or 15. Gold, then, is about six or
seven times as heavy as quartz, or any other stone it is likely to be
associated with. The consequence of this is, that moving water has
at least seven times less power over it?less power to move it along,
either suspended in the water or rolling along its bed.* When the
drift, therefore, was formed, vast quantities of stone might be
removed to great distances, while the gold was left behind, not far
from its native site. All the large lumps of gold will certainly be
but little removed, as also all the large lumps of quartz heavily
freighted with gold. Grains of gold and small lumps may be carried
further, while scale-gold and fine dust, especially if flat and thin,
may be carried to very considerable distances.
GOLD-FEVER. IN CALIFORNIA.
Let us now see into what wild paroxysms of excitement and
delight, alternating with periods of disappointment and misery, the
discovery of gold can lead vast masses of men. And let us begin
with California ?the auriferous region which was the first of the
modern discoveries. While yet its riches were unknown, this region
belonged to Mexico, and was known as Upper California, to distin-
guish it from the peninsula, called Lower California. This last still
belongs to Mexico ; but, in 1848, Upper California was ceded to the
United States, and in 1850 became the state of California.
Separated from the Pacific Ocean by a breadth of 150 miles, there
runs along this country the range of the Sierra Nevada, or Snowy
* We shall see this jnore clearly, perhaps, when we reflect, that stone suspended in
water loses one-third of its weight, but that gold suspended in water loses only one-
nineteenth of its weight.


Mountains, Westward of this range, we find ourselves with warm
skies overhead, green lands around, and forests, lakes, and plains,
valleys and hills blending their varied beauties in the landscape;
busy towns and crowded sea-ports studding the shores, the blue
Pacific beyond, and deeply laden ships passing in and out of the
harbours. At the northern extremity, the Rio Sacramento takes its
rise among the Snowy Mountains, and pouring its fertilising waters
along a wide valley for 250 miles, forms a junction with the San
Joachin, which flows an equal distance from an opposite direction ;
and these two rivers, having thus irrigated an unbroken valley 500
miles in length, pour their united streams to San Francisco, and
there roll into a harbour which, some writers say, would shelter the
united fleets of Europe.
Numerous rivers pour down from among the snowy peaks of the
Sierra Nevada into the Sacramento and San Joachin. Between
these and the sea lies a broken range of less elevated hills, which
cradle among their summits the sources of other streams that flow
directly towards the shore, and discharge their tribute into the sea,
at intervals along the whole coast. The region is therefore profusely
watered, and the richness of the soil in some of the interior valleys
is not surpassed by any in South America.
Possessed for ages by a sparse population of Indians, California
was made known to Europe by Hernan Cortez in 1530, and gradually
fell under the dominion of Spain. Three centuries later, the United
States annexed the northern half of the country; and then California
revived from a sluggish state into which it had sunk under Spanish
rule. Industry was again awake ] old villages were re-tenanted ;
new ones were built; the wasted lands were covered with fresh
cultivation ; towns that had fallen to ruin, with grassy streets and
harbours wholly silent, became full of active life ; and indeed the
entire region presented the appearance of a country reviving from
a long and lethargic apathy to new energy and prosperity. The
means of reaching California by land were developed by degrees.
About 1810, James Pursley discovered a passage across the Rocky
Mountains from Platte River to Santa Ed. This became a regular
caravan route about 1824. In 1845, Captain Fremont struck a
new path across the mountains, farther north, so as to reach the
Sacramento. The travelling arrangements were year by year
improved, until, in 1869, a railway was opened across the whole
breadth of the American continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
The discovery of gold in this region was mainly due to Captain
Sutter, an indefatigable man, who had formed a settlement high up
the Sacramento river. In September 1847, he erected a water-mill
in a spot more than a thousand feet above the level of the lower
valley. His friend, Mr Marshall, was engaged in superintending an
alteration in it, and Captain Sutter was sitting one* afternoon in his
own room writing. Suddenly Marshall rushed in with such excitement


in his face, that his friend confesses to have cast an anxious eye
at his rifle. His sudden appearance was sufficiently curious ; but
Sutter thought him mad when he cried out that he had made a
discovery which would pour into their coffers millions and millions
of dollars with little labour. ? I frankly own,? he says, ? that when
I heard this I thought something had touched Marshall?s brain,,
when suddenly all my misgivings were put an end to by his flinging
on the table a handful of scales of pure virgin gold. I was fairly
thunder-struck.? It was explained that, while widening the channel
that had been made too narrow to allow the mill-wheel to work
properly, a mass of sand and gravel was thrown up by the excavators.
Glittering in this Mr Marshall noticed what he thought to be an
opal?a clear transparent stone common in California. This was
a scale of pure gold, and the first idea of the discoverer was, that
some Indian tribe or ancient possessors of the land had buried a
treasure. Examination, however, shewed the whole soil to teem
with the precious metal; and then mounting a horse, he rode down
to carry the intelligence to his partner. To none but him did he
tell the story of his discovery, and they two agreed to maintain secret
the rich reward. Proceeding together to the spot, they picked up at
quantity of the scales ; and with nothing but a small knife, Captain
Sutter extracted from a little hollow in the rock a solid mass of gold
weighing an ounce and a half. But the attempt to conceal this
valuable revelation was not successful. An artful Kentuckian
labourer observing the eager looks of the two searchers, followed
and imitated them, picking up several flakes of gold. Gradually
the report spread, and as the would-be monopolists returned towards
the mill, a crowd met them holding out flakes of gold, and shouting
with joy. Mr Marshall sought to laugh them out of the idea, and
pretended the metal was of little value; but an Indian who had long
worked elsewhere in a mine of the costly metal, cried : ? Oro ! oro ! ?
and ? Gold ! gold !? was shouted in a lively chorus by the delighted
multitude. This is the account we have from Captain Sutter him-
self. In other narratives, the history of the discovery assumes many
different forms and colours. A squatter constructing a shanty found
gold in the stones employed to build it; a traveller traversing a
stream fell into the water, and the precious dust glittered in the
mud adhering to his clothes ; a hunter in chase of the elk lay down
to sleep in a cavern shining on all sides with scales of gold?these
and other accounts have been promulgated. The rumour was
spread abroad, and the people of San Francisco began to leave the
town and swarm to the ? diggings.? A large body of Mormon
emigrants had just entered California through the south pass of
the Rocky Mountains; they immediately encamped near Sutter?s
Mill, and within a few days more than 1200 men were at work,
with buckets, baskets, shovels, spades, and sheets of canvas, seeking
for gold in the sand of the south fork of the Rio des los Americanos.
s


Perhaps in no other country, at any period of its history, has so
sudden and wonderful a revolution taken place as that which
followed this discovery : as well over the Rocky Mountains as by sea,
ceaseless arrivals from all quarters of the globe swelled the popula-
tion (previously only 25,000 souls). The towns on the coast were
soon almost wholly deserted,, and the few residents that remained
made ample fortunes by levying exorbitant sums for the entertain-
ment and supply of the travellers who came to the port. Vessels in
the harbour were deserted ; the harvest was at first unreaped; and
the industry of the country suddenly stopped, as though struck by
a universal paralysis, while the flood of population contracted and
poured into the valley of the Sacramento. Along the borders of the
rivers, and in the ravines of the wild hilly country, camps were
formed, and tents, bowers, mud huts, and rudely erected sheds,
multiplied and covered the ground. Still, hundreds slept in the
open air, and these hundreds swelled to thousands as each mail
carried to the United States more glowing accounts of the gold.
A few instances of the incidental features of society after the
spread of the mania among the adventurers in search of wealth may
neither be out of place nor unentertaining.
In May 1848, the negro waiter at the San Francisco Hotel, before
the mania had reached its greatest height, refused to serve his
master at the rate of less than ten dollars, or about two pounds a
day. But the universal rage was so strong, that the ?mineral yellow
fever,? as it was termed, left San Francisco at first almost wholly
deserted ; and at the same season a large fleet of merchant-vessels
lay helpless and abandoned, some partially, others wholly deserted.
One ship from the Sandwich Islands was left with no one but its
captain on board; from another the captain started with all his
crew, replying to an observation on his flagrant conduct, that the
cables and anchors would wear well till his return, and that as every
one was too busy to plunder, he ran no risk by deserting his duty.
The Star and Californian newspapers, published at San Francisco,
ceased appearing, as the whole staff, from the editor to the errand-
boy, had gone to dig for gold ; and among the most active workers
in the valley was the ? attorney-general to the king of the Sandwich
Islands.? The influence of this wonderful excitement extended all
over: the world, but was felt most powerfully in the neighbouring
regions of Oregon and Mexico. There, during the early period of
the excitement, the public roads?and especially the nearest way
over the hills?were crowded with anxious travellers, each face bent
towards the ridges of hills dividing their adopted country from the
gold regions. Whole towns and villages were left peopled by
scarcely any other than women, while the men were devoutly on the
pilgrims? path to the shrine of mighty Mammon.
The population that was suddenly gathered together in the valley
of the Sacramento was among the most motley and heterogeneous
6


ever collected in any spot on the surface of the globe. Californian
Indians, with their gay costume in gaudy mimicry of the old nobility
of Castile ; rough American adventurers, lawyers, merchants,
farmers, artisans, professional men, and mechanics of all descrip-
tions, thronged into the scene. Among them were conspicuous a
few ancient Spanish dons in embroidered blue and crimson clothes,
that in their own country had been out of fashion for forty years.
A few gentlemen, and numbers of women, were among the delvers ;
while, after some months had elapsed, even China opened her gates
to let out some adventurous house-builders, who took junks at
Canton, sailed across ten thousand miles of sea, arrived at San
Francisco, and there betook themselves to their calling, and made
large fortunes by the construction of light portable buildings for the
use of the gold-finders in the hot and populous valley.
Within eighteen months, 100,000 men arrived in California from
the United States, and settled temporarily in the valley; though,
after a short period, the return steamers were as well laden with life
as the others. Nine thousand immense wagons came through the
pass of the Rocky Mountains, with an average of five persons to
?each vehicle; 4000 emigrants rode on horseback through the same
route; and of the others, many crossed the Isthmus of Panama,
where the passengers were sometimes so impatient, that the govern-
ment packets were pressed into their service, and compelled to start
?on their voyage before the arrival of the mails. Others made the
sea-voyage of 17,000 miles round Cape Horn. In a New York
paper, sixty sail of ships were advertised to sail for the gold region
in one day. The route by the emigrant trail was at first one of
the utmost weariness and peril. The road, rough and broken
as it was, was thronged with an almost perpetual stream of caravans ;
whole armies appeared to be marching to the gold regions ; and
?each of these, as it passed, opened an easier way to its successor
by levelling the mounds, throwing bridges across the water-chasms,
filling up ravines, and hewing shorter routes through the woods.
Yet numbers fell by the way, and died of hunger, or thirst, or sheer
fatigue, though many were relieved at the settlement of the Mormon
Saints, on the shores of the Great Salt Lake.
Arrived at their destination, their first care was to provide them-
selves, if not already prepared, with implements?pots, kettles, crow-
bars, colanders, baskets, and cradles. These and other instruments,
various and multiplied, constituted the wealth of the gold-seeker.
The towns on the coast were in a continual bustle ; every remnant
of their population was engaged in working at high rates of remune-
ration to supply the wants of new-comers. Captains were compelled
to handcuff their men, to prevent their yielding to the attraction of
the magnetic mineral lying in the valley. Labourers could only be
induced to remain with their employers for a week or two at ten
dollars a day; carpenters and blacksmiths were paid with a daily


ounce of pure gold : laundresses received about thirty-five shillings
for every dozen of articles they washed; cooks commanded thirty
guineas a month ; and houses recently bought for a barrel of ? strong
water/ sold for 20,000 dollars. One speculator spent �45,000 on
the erection of a three-story frame hotel, and immediately found a
tenant, who paid him 20 per cent, on the outlay, and let some of the
rooms, each at the rate of 400 dollars a month, for gambling purposes.
The whole place was a theatre of excitement, and in the delirium of
the mania, persons even far removed from the scene of enthusiasm
committed acts of the utmost folly. They shipped whole cargoes of
fine calicoes and rich silks to a land where there was hardly a female
population at all; they transported immense consignments of costly
furniture to towns where the habitations were mere mud hovels or
timber-frames ; they brought in one mass tobacco enough for several
years? consumption ; paper, which, as the Americans said, ?the
stupendous wastefulness and extravagance of all the Congresses
since the Union could not have consumed since the Declaration ;*
and a number of magnificent pianofortes, which sold for their value
as cupboards!
Yet the prices paid for merchandise and commodities really
wanted were extraordinary: blankets at eight guineas each, fresh
water at a shilling a bucket. Wines and liquors were consumed in
profusion, though to be procured only for extravagant sums. Gold-
dust, doubloons, and dollars were the only money accepted; and a
traveller has declared that many of the miners flung away showers
of small coins, rather than be troubled with the possession of them !
But this feverish fit, like all other paroxysms, was temporary, though,
while it lasted, San Francisco was worthy to be the capital of a gold
region. In the cafds, you were charged, for a small slice of ham,
two eggs, and a cup of coffee, twelve shillings ; and all other pro-
visions sold at equal rates. Powder was very costly, and yet intoxi-
cated men rushed through the streets discharging guns, pistols,
and revolvers, through mere recklessness ; while others, mounted on
horses hired at several guineas a day, galloped wildly without purpose
along the beach. The whole town was a Babel, and in its outskirts
the scene was no less confused, and still more picturesque. A vast
camp stretched around it, and along the shore, to a considerable
distance on either side. Tents of all sizes, shapes, and colours
crowded the mist-covered hills, and piles of merchandise obstructed
the passages between. Immense fires burned in all directions, and
uncouth groups were busy round them, engaged in the various pro-
cesses of cooking or preparing their clothes, arms, implements, or
equipage for the journey to the valley of the Sacramento. Such is a
sketch of the gateway of this region as it appeared under its new
aspect in 1848.
The early processes of gold-finding at California may now be
described. The gold flakes were found impregnating the sand or
8


shingle, either actually below water, or left dry by the absorption or
diversion of some current from the hills ; though in the gullies and
ravines large lumps were plentifully discovered m the crevices ot
rocks, in cracks in the ground, or among the roots of trees, itie
sand in the streams was usually worth, in the gross, from one to two
shillings a poundweight. The soil was composed largely ot grave ,
full of small stones like jasper, fragments of slate, and chips ot
basalt, evidently washed down from the mountains. At first, tne
simplest method was employed to collect it. Tubs, pans, and tin
pans were filled with mud and water, which was rapidly stirred,
allowed to settle for a moment, and then poured off, leaving the
heavy portion precipitated to the bottom. This was found a tedious
and incomplete process. Sieves of woven willow-twigs were next
tried, and for the same reason abandoned by all who could procure
more serviceable utensils. Some ingenious miner invented the
? rocker,? a wooden cradle raised more at one end than at the other,
and thus forming an incline. Across the bottom are nailed some
broad laths, and over the top is placed a grating or perforated plate
of tin. Some are small, and worked by one man, who first piles the
auriferous earth on the upper tray, and then with one hand rocks the
machine, while with the other he bales water into it with a tin pan.
Some of them, however, occupy four men, whose division of labour
is complete: one with a suitable spade shovels the earth into his
pans; the next carries it to the cradle, and flings it heavily on the
close grating; the third rocks the machine ; and the fourth continually
pours water upon the mass inside. A heavy sediment, rich in go d,
is left at the bottom, while all the light substances are washed away.
In the upper districts, the gold was principally found in the bed or
dry beds of mountain torrents, between rocky and precipitous
channels, in a yellowish-red soil. The finer dust was found in the
lower region, the rough lumps in the more elevated. Massive pieces
were discovered only in the upper country.
The scenes presented in the gold region by the busy multitude
toiling in it were thus described at that period : ?ln one spot may
be seen a party of newly arrived emigrants, each armed with a
shovel, a tin pan, a sieve, or a colander, and all standing m the
water scooping up the sand into buckets, stirring the contents with
their bare arms, and watching the result with glistening eyes, as the
water is poured off, and the precious sediment revealed; m another,
men are busy in collecting the gold-dust, after passing through the
first rough process of cleansing, in small, closely woven baskets of
Indian manufacture, which are arranged on the ground in the full
glare of the sun; in another, a large party is labouring with the
immense rockers ?or gold-canoes, as the Indians term them
gravely, as though accustomed to their task ; in another, scattered
individuals are groping with knives, crowbars, and even common
sticks, in the dry ravines, expecting by this desultory labour to earn
Si 9


more by picking up small masses of pure ore than by industriously
toiling amid the sands; in another, the miners are spreading their
shining stores to dry on pieces of canvas; while everywhere multi-
tudes of men, in all varieties of costume, and collected from all
quarters of the world, maintain an incessant motion and hum, sug-
gesting the idea of some colony of gigantic ants engaged in collecting
the materials for their dwellings.?
Many adventurous dealers established stores or improvised shops
at the diggings in the following way : In front was placed a large
awning, with a barrel set upright at each corner. Four broad
planks formed convenient counters on each side, and on these were
displayed the articles for sale. The miners, clad in greasy deer-
skin pantaloons, and red hunting-shirts?the common costume in
the diggings?came to the store, and produced, from the folds of
a sash or handkerchief, leathern pouches full of gold scales, which
they shook into the balance to the amount demanded. Some of the
dust often fell on the board, and the storekeepers volunteered to
return it; but unless it was a large quantity, the general answer
was ; ?No; keep it: there?s plenty more where that came from,?
One man came to them for a bottle of brandy, and bought it for
half an ounce of gold-powder, inviting the Americans to drink with
him. They declined ; he insisted, and they still refused; when he
dashed the bottle to shivers against a tree, and went on with other
purchases.
The gains amassed by the miners were regulated partly by the
shrewdness of the individual in the choice of his locality, and partly
by accident. Some collected gold at the rate of half an ounce,
others of an ounce, a day ; while there were instances of a thousand
dollars per man per day. Some of the miners were accustomed to
toil incessantly for a long period, and then, assembling near some
well-provided store, to spend most of their gains in one extravagant
fit of luxury, when they returned to their labour, to renew the feast
as soon as new treasure had been accumulated. They spread an
awning overhead, supplied themselves with brandy, champagne, and
choice provisions, ate and drank to repletion ; and when satiated
with the costly indulgence, rushed out among the tents with
brandished knives or rifles, shooting at any mark they fancied.
But worse than mere reckless squandering occurred. Many of
the men were desperadoes, and their success was distributed
unequally. Here at once was a source of disorganisation. The
unfortunate envied the prosperous, and these suspected all others.
Partnerships were formed in sanguine hope, and broken off in bitter
distrust.
To what extent the gold-workings of California have been carried
on in subsequent years, we shall notice in a later page. At present,
we dwell only on the extraordinary scenes of excitement which the
first year or two of the discovery presented. And now it will be
IO


interesting to trace the production of scenes very similar in character,
in a wholly distinct part of the world.
GOLD-FEVER IN AUSTRALIA.
Every one knows that Australia is a great squarish-shaped
island, or rather continent, in the southern hemisphere, about 2000
miles across from north to south, and 2500 from east to west, with
the tropic of Capricorn running through the middle of it, so that its
northern coasts reach within 11 degrees of the equator. Along its
eastern side there runs a band of mountainous country, from Cape
York on the north, to Wilson?s Promontory on the south. These
mountains rise 6500 feet in a part called the Australian Alps, or
Snowy Mountains, in about south latitude 36�, and this is the
loftiest point at present known in the country. There are numerous
summits rising 4000 feet all along the course of the chain as far
north as Cape Melville, near south latitude 14 0 , beyond which it
gradually declines in height and importance. In the colony of
Victoria are several short ranges of mountains, fifty miles long or
so, running north and south, and rising 3000 or 4000 feet above the
sea. The great eastern chain is very largely composed of granite,
which forms some of its most lofty and massive mountain groups,
and often appears in the beds of its ravines beneath the other rocks.
On the granite rest great but irregular masses of gneiss, mica-slate,
chlorite-slate, clay-slate, and other metamorphic rocks. These are
frequently traversed by granitic dikes and veins, as also by large
intrusive masses of granite, syenite, porphyry, greenstone, and other
similar igneous rocks. Upon this metamorphic set of rocks rest
here and there large and regularly stratified sheets of unaltered rocks,
principally sandstone, with interstratified beds of shale, and some
beds of limestone. These rocks are full of fossils, resembling those
found in the Devonian and Silurian rocks of Western Europe ; and
among the mineral treasures contained in them, gold is now known
to be one.
The discovery of gold in Australia, like that of California, was
reserved for an individual who proceeded upon no scientific view
of the subject. Mr Edward Hargreaves, having had a farm on the
flanks of the Conobolas, some thirty miles west of Bathurst, in New
South Wales, went to California in search of gold. While there, he
was struck with the similarity between the rocks and earthy matters
of California and those of his own district. He returned, accordingly,
to Australia, ?prospected? in his own neighbourhood, and after one
or two months? search (April 1851), found some gold. Being assured
of the valuable nature of his discovery, Mr Hargreaves applied to
the colonial government for reward; and on his report being veri-
fied by Mr Stutchbury, the colonial geologist, Mr Hargreaves was
rewarded by a bonus of �5OO, and an appointment as ? Commissioner
of Crown Lands for the Exploration of Gold Districts.?
11


w T iJj element of course became intense throughout the colony
of New South Wales and spread rapidly into that of Victoria!
People, many of them ill provided and ill suited for the work, rushed
to the gold-diggings; wages rose to great rates ; and the prices of
provjsions to extravagant heights. It was soon found, however, that
.gold-digging was hard and weary work, and that, carried on without
proper preparation of tools and division of labour, without shelter
and with scanty food, it was too much either for the health the
strength, or the resolution of most people to endure. A consider-
able reaction took place accordingly, and wages and food sank
again nearly to their original prices in New South Wales. A slight
?accession of the gold-fever occurred, in consequence of the discovery
Mnrmn n r red r i S t � f f� ld ? or / 4 ��� worth in one block, on the
J^ r �� miles north of Bathurst. This finding of a
hundredweight of gold is so singular a circumstance in the world?s
history, that a particular account of it may be acceptable. ?ln the
ir 1 ? an edu , cated aboriginal, formerly attached
to the Wellington Mission, and who had been in the service of
.J. Kerr, Esq., of Wallawa, about seven years, returned home
to his employer with the intelligence, that he had discovered
a , :f r , ge , m , ass �[. ��| d amongst a heap of quartz upon the run
whilst tending his sheep. He had amused himself by exploring
the country adjacent to his employer?s land, and his attention
was first called to the lucky spot by observing a speck of some
glittering yellow substance upon the surface of a block of the quartz
upon which he broke off a portion. At that moment, the splendid
prize stood revealed to his sight. His first care was to start off
home and disclose his discovery to his master, to whom he presented
whatever gold might be procured from it. As maybe supposed,
little time was lost by the worthy doctor. Quick as horseflesh would
carry mm, he was on the ground; and in a very short period the
three blocks of quartz, containing the hundredweight of gold, were
released from the bed where, charged with unknown wealth, they
. ad . res^ ed P er baps for thousands of years, awaiting the hand of
civilised man to disturb them. The largest of the blocks was about
a loot in diameter, and weighed 75 pounds gross. Out of this piece
60 pounds of pure gold were taken. Before separation, it was
beautifully incased in quartz. The other two were something
smaller. The auriferous mass weighed, as nearly as could be
guessed, from two to three hundredweight. The heaviest of the two
large pieces presented an appearance not unlike a honeycomb or
sponge and consisted of particles of a crystalline form, as did nearly
the whole of the gold. The second larger piece was smoother, and
the particles more condensed, and seemed as if it had been acted
upon by water. The remainder was broken into lumps of from two
to three pounds and downwards, and was remarkably free from
quartz or earthy matter.?


On the first reports of the discovery of gold near Bathurst reaching
Victoria, many people started, and more were preparing to start
from Port Phillip and the neighbourhood to Bathurst and the Turon.
This would be a journey of between 400 and 500 miles, through a
difficult and thinly peopled country, and would require ten days, even
under the most favourable circumstances. The mass of the people
attempting it would probably require a month. It began soon tO'
be whispered, however, that this arduous journey might be spared,,
and that gold existed within two days? walk or ride of Melbourne,
After many flying rumours and reports during the (southern) winter
months of 1851 ?namely, June to September?certain information
came to Mr Latrobe, the governor of Victoria, which induced him
to make a journey to examine for himself.
In a report to Earl Grey, dated October 10, 1851, Governor
Latrobe described what met his view on a visit to Ballarat: ? Gold
has been detected, I believe, in all the superior formations, even in
the superficial soil. But by far the richest deposit is found in the-
small veins of blue clay which lie almost immediately above the-
pipe-clay, in which no trace of the ore has been discovered. The
ore is to all appearance quite pure. It is found occasionally in
rolled or water-worn irregular lumps of various sizes, from a quarter
or half an ounce to two ounces in weight, sometimes incorporated
with round pebbles of quartz, which appears to have formed its
original matrix; at other times, without any admixture whatever,
in irregular rounded or smooth pieces, and again in fused irregular
masses of pure metal of great beauty, weighing in some instances
seven to nine ounces I may give your lordship some idea
of the value of this partial deposit, however, when hit upon, by
stating that I witnessed during my visit the washing of two tin
dishes of this clay, of about twenty inches in diameter, the yield of
which was no less than 8 poundweights of pure gold ; and I have
seen two, or at most three cubic inches of the same yield four
ounces One party is known to have raised 16 poundweights at
an early hour of the day, and to have secured 3 r poundweights?
value about ,�l3oo?in one day?s work. Many parties of four men
have shared, day after day, 10 ounces per man?value at least �3O.
I can testify to the fact of 10 poundweights ?value about �4OO or
�44o?and upwards being the produce of a single working during
one of the days of my visit, and I have no reason to believe that
this case was at that time an isolated one.?
In attempting to describe the state of excitement into which the
population was thrown by the news of these occurrences, he says :
? Within the last three weeks, the towns of Melbourne and Geelong,
and their large suburbs, have been in appearance almost emptied of
many classes of their male inhabitants. Not only have the idlers, to
be found in every community, and day-labourers in town and the adja-
cent country, shopmen, artisans and mechanics of every description,


thrown up their employments, and in most cases leaving their
employers and their wives and families to take care of themselves,
run off to the workings ; but respectable tradesmen, farmers, clerks
of every grade, and not a few of the superior classes followed?some
unable to withstand the mania and force of the stream, or because
they were really disposed to venture time and money on the chance,
but others because they were, as employers of labour, left in the lurch,
and had no other alternative. Cottages are deserted, houses to let,
business is at a standstill, and even schools are closed. In some of
the suburbs, not a man is left; and the women are known, for self-
protection, to forget neighbours? jars, and to club together to keep
house. Even masters of vessels, foreseeing the impossibility of main-
taining any control over their men otherwise, have found the only
way was to join them, make up a party, and go shares with them at
the diggings.?
When the excitement consequent on the discovery of the Ballarat
Diggings was beginning to abate, and many men returning to their
employments, it received a fresh accession of strength, and was
turned into a new direction, by the report of those found at Mount
Alexander. This is a hill about seventy miles north-west of Mel-
bourne, part of the granitic district of Mount Macedon and Mount
Byng. Writing in December, Mr Latrobe said : ? I will here only
briefly state, that the gold raised upon the Mount Alexander gold-
fields is now calculated by hundredweights, and arrives in the cities
by the government escort or private conveyance at the rate of
probably two tons per week?so it has been at least for the last two
weeks.?
Those of the labouring class who returned successful, naturally
committed all sorts of extravagance : some ordered the best and
most expensive silks and dresses for their wives and children, as
well as gold watches and chains, the most costly that could be got;
bank-notes were eaten between slices of bread and butter, and other
stories are current, such as one reads as told of sailors paid off with
prize-money during the war. One deep old file, an old soldier in
every sense of the term, had a child born to him at one of the
diggings, and instantly seeing his chance, went round with a hat to
make a collection for ? the little stranger ? ?? the first child born at
the diggings ;? the value of his hatful was found to amount to about
�3000!
All ordinary employments, and all the ordinary relations of society,
were meanwhile undergoing a strange revolution in Melbourne. One
of the judges was so deserted of all servants, that, but for the
assistance of his sons, he, being lame, could not have been drawn in
his wheeled-chair from his house to his court. A gentleman offered
a man half-a-crown to take a letter to the post-office, a distance of a
few hundred yards. The man looked disgusted. ? Why,? he replied,
? I would not take my pipe out of my mouth for that sum.? Another


offered a digger a shilling to lift a bag of sugar off his dray. The
digger looked at him a moment, and then, putting his foot on a
stump, said : ? There, tie my shoe, and I ?ll give you five shillings/
It was also related, that a sheep-farmer, who had been deserted by
his men, went after them to the diggings, and tried to wile them
back by an offer of what would, in ordinary circumstances, have been
extravagantly high wages, when they coolly made the counter-pro-
posal to him of a still higher salary, provided he would stay and
act as their cook. All the successful gold-diggers did not act with
extravagance. Captain Chisholm, within seven weeks after his
arrival at Port Phillip, had received not less than �2OOO in gold-
dust, from labouring-men, to pay the passage out of their relatives
at home.
By the month of September 1852, the accounts from Australia
gave such a view of the progress of the gold-digging as exceeded
the most sanguine expectations that were originally formed upon
the subject. The product of the precious metal in the Victoria
fields, and especially at Mount Alexander, was of astounding magni-
tude. The first year of the Australian gold-mining, ending in May
1852, saw .�3,600,000 exported to England. This, of course, at once
enriched the colony, notwithstanding every drawback produced by
the derangement of ordinary industry.
There was one little attack of the same gold-fever in another part
of Australia, and at a much later date. But this was rather the fever
of failure than of success, seeing that there was very little gold to
reward the seekers. This time it was further north than either New
South Wales or Victoria, being in Queensland. At a part of the
east coast of Australia, 900 miles northward of Sydney, gold was dis-
covered in 1858, on either side of Fitzroy River. No settlers in that
region had found a means of existence, except the owners of a few
sheep-farms and cattle-runs, stores, and drinking-booths. Unluckily,
the reports were exaggerated. One rumour was to the effect that
? one man in a party of three had made �7OOO as his share in one gold-
field/ The Sydney Morning Herald made a determined attempt to
trace this story to its origin, and found (as in the older story of the
Three Black Crows) that the truth diminished in importance the
farther back it was traced. ? A gentleman in office, Mr A., had heard
it mentioned by Mr B. of the Exchange, who, it was said, had seen
the letter describing the discovery. A second gentleman had it on what
he considered most reliable authority?namely, five mercantile men,
and one high official. As the official resided out of town, we deferred
further inquiries until Tuesday morning. Yesterday, we sent to Mr
B. who said he heard it from Mr C, a custom-house agent. To Mr
C. accordingly we went, who referred us to Captain D. This gentle-
man was not at home; but a relative of his informed us that she had
heard her brother mention that such a letter had been received,
although she herself had not seen it. Pursuing our inquiries, we at


length heard that the letter was in the possession of the toll-keeper
at the Paramatta toll-bar. A special messenger was at once sent
thither. The toll-keeper said he had heard of the letter, but had not
seen it.? And so the story of the �7OOO vanished.
But the news spread like wild-fire before the correction could
come. During one single month, the Sydney shipowners despatched
no' less than 27 vessels, taking out more than 3000 adventurers,
diggers, storekeepers, &c. ; Melbourne sent an equal number;
while Brisbane and Newcastle helped to swell the list. Every one
talked of Port Curtis, Gladstone, Rockingham, and other places near
the Fitzroy, as if they were paved with gold. High and low were
attacked with the fever. Those who did not go in person racked
their ingenuity to prepare outfits for those who did. Six or seven
thousand persons started nearly at one time, in ships which also
carried deals, posts, rails, palings, shingles, doors, sashes, iron store-
houses, blankets, mattresses, clothing, picks, shovels, axes, camp-
kettles, portable stoves, belts for stuffing with gold, scales for weigh-
ing gold, and countless other articles. Workmen left their benches,
labourers their fields, shopmen their counters, clerks their desks,
fathers their families, to rush off to El Dorado prepared for
nothing but success; seeing that they were wholly unfitted to
encounter failure or disaster. The result was a lesson of a severe
kind. The voyage of many hundred miles was succeeded by a land-
journey of thirty-five miles, from the landing-place at Rockhampton
to the auriferous spot at Canoona, through a region having no
roads, and very few vehicles. A little gold had really been found
by the early adventurers ; but those who came after, weary and foot-
sore, had nothing but disappointment in store. Some, going west-
ward to the diggings, met others returning east, impoverished and
heart-sick. Plenty of stores were sent out, but were not owned by
the gold-seekers, and could not be obtained by them for lack of
money. At Canoona itself (the weather being very dry), water sold
at sixpence a gallon. An eye-witness, representing one of the Sydney
newspapers, said: ? Many hundreds of the adventurers, dismayed by
the cries that met them, never went to Canoona at all; they landed,
took fright, and sought eagerly for a return passage to Sydney.
Hastily-built stores at Rockhampton were in imminent danger of
pillage by the more ruffianly of the disappointed adventurers. Many
of the passengers, startled at this state of affairs, did not land at all ;
they quietly returned to the port whence they came, wiser, but poorer
than before. Many of the merchants and agents, going out with
ventures of merchandise, resolved, under the circumstances, not to
break bulk at all ; they either held back for a time, or returned to
Sydney. The sufferings of many on shore were very great, for
Rockhampton and Canoona could not accommodate all, even if
money had been at hand ; while those whose little store of cash had
been exhausted by the outfit and the voyage were reduced to absolute
l 6


want. The diggers or adventurers, arriving at a particular spot, and
finding no gold, sought for some one on whom to cast the blame.
One particular individual, living in the neighbourhood, had been one
of the first to make the announcement of gold at Canoona; the dis-
appointed and half-maddened people, rushing to an illogical conclu-
sion with the same heedlessness with which they had rushed to the
diggings, accused him of being the cause of their miseries ; and he
was placed in imminent peril of ?lynching.? The captains of all the
ships were received with fierce abuse, on the ground that the ship-
owners had, by their exaggerated advertisements, contributed to the
misery.? In later years, the gold-deposits of this part of Australia
were steadily worked with a fair profit; but the opening scenes in
1858 were indeed desperate. We have stated that these diggings
are in Queensland, but at the time of the discovery they were
included in New South Wales?the colony not having been divided
into two until 1859.
GOLD IN ALL COUNTRIES.
Although two particular regions of the globe have been marked
by these extravagant social convulsions, arising out of the discovery
of the precious metal in unexpected places, yet the extraction and
commerce in gold have taken more regular forms in other countries,
and from a very early period in the world?s history. Until the
Californian discoveries took place, the chief sources of supply in
modern times were Brazil, Hungary, Transylvania, and Asiatic
Russia. During a long series of years, the gold mines of these four
countries yielded to the value of about .�5,000,000 annually. Brazil,
however, as well as Peru, New Granada, and other parts of South
America, have gradually fallen off; because the auriferous sand,
easily gathered, has become well nigh exhausted; and because South
America does not possess much of the machinery necessary for the
profitable extraction of the small percentage of metal contained in
gold quartz. Hungary and Transylvania, in like manner, have
somewhat declined in recent years as gold-producing countries.
Russia, especially in the Asiatic provinces, has gradually assumed
a somewhat important position in regard to this source of national
wealth. Nominally, there is great individual freedom in the search
for gold; but practically much of the produce finds its way into the
pockets of officials, who cheat both the revenue and the diggers.
The adventurer may search on any spot not already appropriated,
after certain formalities with the officials. The gold is found mostly
in grains and small fragments in the sandy bed of streams. The
actual workmen employed by the adventurer are mostly the unfor-
tunates who have been banished to Siberia, and who are permitted
to earn a little money in this way under a system of licensing.
When the washings of one season are collected, the adventurer takes


his gold-dust and fragments to a government establishment. The
gold is weighed, melted down, and poured into iron ingot-moulds,
each of which, if full, would contain about thirty-six pounds avoir-
dupois. The ingot is assayed, and its value per ounce declared.
In all these proceedings there are many loopholes for bribery,
favouritism, and fraud; and much of the precious metal sticks
(metaphorically) to the hands of the officials. The weighing,
melting, assaying, and registering being concluded, the gold is sent
to St Petersburg, and lodged in the royal mint. When coined
into money, a certain percentage is retained by the state, for
the expenses of transport, &c., and the remainder transmitted in
cash to the owner. Some years ago it was stated that the owner
seldom received so much as three-fourths of the registered value,
owing to the doubtful nature of the officialism concerned in the
matter ; but possibly matters may have improved since. Mr Cottrell,
one of the few observant English travellers in Siberia, has given
the following account, to illustrate the precarious nature of gold-
seeking in this region. A Russian gentleman, M. Astaschef, retired
from government service, in order to become a gold-speculator.
He borrowed forty thousand roubles from a merchant named Popof,
who had made money by gold-speculation; and then joined part-
nership with a third person, M. Riazanof, who had spent no less
than two hundred thousand roubles before finding any auriferous
sands worth working. The partners made a lucky examination of
the sands of a small stream, and agreed that each should take one
bank or side. They realised wealth rapidly, and then established a
company, of which they were appointed managers. Astaschef was
reported a millionaire after the lapse of a few years; the tide of
fortune had turned with him just in time; for thirty-five thousand
out of his forty thousand borrowed roubles were expended before
he hit upon the golden stream, which was in the government of
Yeniseisk, between the rivers Touba and Kan. Another rich spot
owned by him was near the boundary between the governments of
Yeniseisk and Irkutsk. Russia has occasionally yielded gold, in her
Siberian provinces chiefly, to the value of �4,000,000 in one year, but
generally the quantity has been much less. The great start, from
one or two to three or four millions sterling in a year, was made in
1842, consequent on new discoveries in the provinces of Tomsk and
Yeniseisk. One of the largest nuggets the world has ever seen, valued
at three thousand pounds, was ferreted out of the sands in Siberia.
In various other parts of Asia, besides Siberia, gold has been
found, and for a much more considerable length of time; but the
quantity in recent years has not been so great as to attract the
attention of Europe. Africa, it is well known, contains gold, chiefly
(so far as has been ascertained) in the sands and mud of rivers.
Indeed, one part of the Atlantic sea-board of that continent has
received the name of the Gold Coast, owing to the fact that the
i 3


natives, finding gold in the interior, bring it down for sale at the
European settlements on the coast.
Passing over to the new continent, we have already stated that
South America does not now occupy any very conspicuous position
in regard to gold mines. The prosperity of the trade in that region
culminated about a century ago, when the auriferous sands were
very rich. Small gold-mining establishments are scattered about in
Brazil, and in some of the numerous republics of South and Central
America; but the sands are nearly exhausted ; and the extraction
of the precious metal from quartz is effected on a system so rude as
to yield only a small margin of profit. Silver, in South and Central
America, as well as in the Mexican provinces of North America, is
now a more important metal than gold, so far as regards mines and
mining. .
Of the wonders of California we have treated at length, in
reference to the wild excitement consequent on the gold-discoveries;
we may here usefully say a few words concerning the amount of
wealth realised. By the middle of 1852, when the Californian
diggings had been at work about four years and a half, gold had
been raised to the estimated value of �35,000,000 ?an average of
�600,000 per month. Fourteen years later, in 1866, California
claimed to have sent into the market 38,000,000 ounces of gold,
valued at �150,000,000; and we cannot be far wrong in setting
down �200,000,000 as the approximate value down to the end of
1869 ?a marvellous addition to the wealth of one single country.
British Columbia, another large region in North America, entered
the list of gold-yielding countries about the year 1858. This, the
youngest of England?s colonies, is further north than California, but
is, like it, confined between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific.
The Fraser River, one of the streams flowing from the mountains to
the ocean, is rich in gold; and it is a curious coincidence, that as
gold was discovered in California almost at the time of the
annexation of that region to the United States, so was a similar
discovery made on the shores of the Fraser directly after the
formation of British Columbia into an English colony in 1858 ?it
having previously been a mere hunting-ground in the hands of the
Hudson?s Bay Company. The discovery was sudden, and was
promising enough to draw numerous gold-diggers from California.
A letter, written in the early summer of 1858, said : ? The gold exists
from the mouth of Fraser River for at least two hundred miles up,
and most likely much farther. Any one working on its banks has
been able to obtain gold in abundance, and without extraordinary
labour; the gold at present obtained has been within a foot of the
surface. Thompson River is quite as rich in gold as Fraser River.
The land about Thompson River consists of extensive sandy prairies,
which are loaded with gold also ; in fact, the whole country about
both rivers is impregnated with it. I have already seen pounds and
19


pounds of it, and hope before long to feast my eyes upon tons of the
precious metal; but not a bit of it, unfortunately, is my own. Before
three months are over our heads, we expect to see at least 50,000
miners at work.? A correspondent of the Times told how precarious
was the life of those who reached the diggings without money, and
did not immediately find gold : ? Those who have money to pay for
provisions, can have enough on the spot [at exorbitant prices].
Those who have no money must starve. The alternative is as clear
as the sun at noonday. They can neither buy food nor leave the
place. They cannot spread themselves over the country, for the
following reasons : the banks of the river, high up where the miners
are congregated, are steep and lofty perpendicular walls of rock,
which cannot be scaled; while the other portions of its banks are
covered with impenetrable forests, without a track or a trail, which
they dare not penetrate for fear of the Indians.? Some spots,
supposed to be very rich in gold, were so difficult of access as to
present the following picture : ? A man has to carry his provisions
in blankets, on his back, up a laborious ascent in hot weather. He
cannot carry over fifty pounds in weight, besides his traps, tools,
and firearms. He takes several days to perform the journey ; at its
termination, one-third or more of his stock of provisions has been
used on the tramp. He digs, and digs successfully ; but as he is in
a wilderness where his supplies cannot be renewed, after a few
days? work, he must hurry down before his little stock of eatables
is exhausted; or if he remains until he shall have eaten it all, he
dies of hunger. There is no relief for him. So he comes back with
some gold, but not much. Several are said to have perished of
hunger in this upper region.? Nevertheless, as the gold was unques-
tionably there, and in large quantity, adventurers conquered all
other difficulties one by one; and Fraser River and its tributaries
assumed a definite rank among auriferous regions. It was soon
ascertained that the gold in the river-sands was the mere washings
from more copious deposits in the rocks above; and road-makers
by degrees hewed a path upwards. On the other side, hardy men
from Canada, Red River, and Minnesota, pushed their way west-
ward across the Rocky Mountains, and entered the golden regions
by a new route. It is not easy to say what amount of gold has been
raised in British Columbia; because, California being nearer, and
more accessible, much of the gold finds its way thither, and figures
in statistical accounts rather as a produce of the United States
than of a British dependency. We find, however, the following
sums mentioned as the value of the bullion and specie exported
from British Columbia: �1,750,000 in 1864; �1, 000,000 in 1865;
�1,050,000 in 1866; and �700,000 in 1867, It is evident that we
have only got hold of part of the facts here ; the item for 1867
can only be a percentage of the value of the gold actually raised
in that year.


Another portion of North America, Nova Scotia, entered the lists
as a humble competitor with California and British Columbia in
1861. In the summer of that year, a man stooping to drink at a
brook discovered something glittering in the water, at a place called
Old Tangier ;it proved to be gold. Soon afterwards, the precious
metal was found at New Tangier, at a distance of less than a mile
from the sea. Numerous other lucky spots were hit upon; and
gold-washing and quartz-crushing became regular employments.
One of the gold-fields, Laidlaw Diggings, is within a dozen miles
of Halifax, the capital of the colony; and it possesses gold in the
forms of small nuggets, specks and scales, and gold quartz. A
?Nova Scotia Gold Company? was established, chiefly for obtaining
gold from quartz, by well-arranged machinery, but also for washing
auriferous sands. The colony has never yet presented such rich
deposits as the other two regions of North America just noticed.
But, on the other hand, there were less privations in store for the
first adventurous diggers. The country was settled, and a large
portion well cultivated ; the necessaries of life were plentiful and
cheap; while communication with the busy port of Halifax was
short and easy?a port, too, within ten or eleven days of England
by Cunard steamer. In this, as in other regions, careful observers
have noted how different a thing it is to pick up nuggets of pure
gold, and to extract laboriously a small percentage of the precious
metal from the quartz. Captain Hardy, who sent an account of the
Nova Scotia diggings to one of the English newspapers, after
noticing a few instances of the more fortunate kind, said : ? But let
it be stated for the information of individuals who may contemplate
seeking their fortunes in these nearest of the yet-discovered American
gold regions, that they are not in the least likely to repay the man
who may embark without capital, expecting to hew out his golden
treasure in large nuggets, and with little labour, from the narrow
quartz veins which intersperse the clay-slate of the gold district.
Without doubt, quartz-mining will repay companies organised to
prosecute mining on an extensive scale, with capital, and with the
requisite machinery for crushing the quartz ; but I can aver that in
the numerous instances of solitary gold-seekers working their narrow
claims of some thirty feet square, which are purchased of the pro-
vincial government for �4, and on a year?s lease, they have not
been repaid for leaving their rightful trades and avocations.? Between
1861 and 1868, Nova Scotia produced 160,000 oz. of gold, value
� 63,000.
Australia we have already noticed, in connection with the feverish
excitement which arose out of the discovery of gold in 1851. There,
as in California, the population settled down by degrees into some-
thing like regular order. Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, bene-
fited much more largely than Sydney, the chief city in New South
Wales ?partly because the produce in the first-named colony was


1862
1863
1864
�8,800,000
�3,000,000
1865
1866
1867
�2,800,000
larger than in the second, partly because Melbourne had certain
commercial advantages. Victoria had the renown of bringing to
light the largest mass of nearly-pure gold the world has ever seen ?
so far as records afford the means of judging. It was discovered at
the Ballarat diggings in 1858, and at once received the name of
the ?Welcome Nugget.? The weight was 2166 oz., and the value
�8376. This value shews, by its near approach to �4 per oz.,
that the purity must have been about equal to that of sterling
or standard gold (�3, 17s. qd. per oz.). New South Wales pro-
duced gold to the total weight of 3,281,000 oz., value �1 1,683,857,
in the first ten years of her operations (1851-60). Victoria exceeded
this quantity nine-fold : her produce in the same ten years reach-
ing the enormous quantity (in round numbers) of 26,000,000 oz.,
value �104,000,000. We can well understand the pride and pleasure
with which that colony sent the ?Gold Trophy? to the International
Exhibition in 1862, It was an obelisk, 45 feet high, by 10 feet
square at the base, representing in cubic content the bulk of all the
gold raised in the colony in eleven years?l�sl to 1861 inclusive.
Down to the end of 1867, the sum-total was reckoned at �136,000,000
?besides the gold of New South Wales. Taking the two colonies
in six years, the relative degrees of activity which they have presented,
in the export of gold in the various forms of coin, bars, and dust,
Victoria. New South Wales.
But these figures do not accurately denote the quantities of new
gold raised year by year, seeing that the mints at Sydney and
Melbourne coin for other colonies besides their own, and include
large portions of such coinages among their exports. A recent
Report states that there were 63,181 gold-miners at work in Victoria
in 1868, earning an average of .�lO5 per man in the year. The race
between California and Victoria has been close: the one, �147,000,000
in nineteen years ; the other, �136,000,000 in seventeen years. It
will serve to illustrate the great difference between finding pure gold
in the forms of nuggets and grains in sand and mud, and extracting
it by mechanical processes from quartz, to state that, out of 350,405
tons of quartz crushed in Victoria in tone year, the ratio of gold only
averaged 17 dwts. 2 grains per ton ?not much more than 1 part
of gold in 40,000 parts of quartz.
New Zealand, another among the gold-fields of the southern
hemisphere, is late in date and small in richness compared with


those just named ; yet it has been the means of giving to the Middle
Island (as it is called) a great preponderance in wealth over the
Northern Island?irrespective of the troubles pressing on the latter
consequent on the warlike proclivities of the Maories. The first
discovery was made in the province of Otago, in June 1861. The
discoverer, Mr Gabriel Read, descried the precious metal at a spot
since called Gabriel?s Gully, on a small river about forty miles from
Otago, the chief town in the province. He notified the fact to the
provincial council, by whom he was rewarded with the very modest
sum of .�SOO. Within two months from the day of the discovery,
3000 persons were at work on the banks of the Tuapeka, getting
gold to the extent of 6000 oz. per week. About a year afterwards,
the place and the scene were described in the following words ; ? The
immediate effect of the discovery of gold was to attract immigrants
from Australia and from the neighbouring New Zealand provinces.
Since then, the population of Otago has doubled, being now esti-
mated at 25,000. Gold to the value of more than a million sterling
has been exported from Dunedin, and that small body of settlers
have suddenly found themselves raised to circumstances of afflu-
ence.? That these discoveries must have been very advantageous to
the province of Otago, and indirectly to the whole of the colony, is
made manifest by the following figures, relating to the quantity of
gold shipped from New Zealand down to the end of 1867 : 194,234
oz. in 1861 ; 410,862 oz. in 1862 ; 628,646 oz. in 1863 ; 480,187 oz. in
1864 ; 574,574 oz. in 1865 ; 735,376 oz. in 1866; and 686,753 oz, in
1867 ?gold to the value of �14,508,749 in seven years. Recently,
valuable gold-discoveries have been made in the North Island also.
Lastly (for it is hardly necessary to speak of isolated deposits
dotted about in various parts of the world), we may say a few words
concerning the four sections of the United Kingdom. The dis-
coveries made by antiquaries shew that gold was well known both
in Britain and in Ireland many centuries ago, in the form of orna-
ments ; and it is probable that some at least of this gold was found
in Scotland.
In more than half the counties of England, gold has been dis-
covered in small quantities ; and there is evidence that, not only in
medieval times, but as far back as the Roman occupation, the
deposits were worked in a rude sort of way. About the year 1853,
much excitement sprang up in Devon and Cornwall, due to the
introduction of an ore-crushing machine of great efficiency. It has
been long known that gossan and mundic , two mineral substances
found in tin and copper mines, contain a little gold; but the expense
of extracting the precious metal was more than the value of the
extract. Professor Ansted stated, as the result of experiments, that
if ore contains so little as half an ounce of gold to the ton, Berdan?s
ore-crushing machine would separate it at a profit. The question
thence arose, What is the percentage of gold in the various mineral


substances found in copper and tin mines ? The entire quieting
down of gold-mining speculation in our counties supplies the
answer; the percentage is too small to attract much notice from
commercial men.
There is more chance in Wales than in England; the surface is
more mountainous, and the mountains contain a good deal of
metallic wealth. Almost all the twelve Welsh counties have yielded
gold, in the copper, lead, and tin mines. In x�6i and 1862, much
attention was bestowed on the Vigra gold mines, as they were called,
about midway between Dolgelly and Barmouth. The gold was found
in small veins in slaty beds, interlaid between coarse, greenish-gray
gritstones. A water-wheel was erected on the spot, sixty feet in
diameter, employed in working a powerful Cornish crushing-
machine. The machine was capable of crushing forty tons of ore
daily. In iB6O, the whole Welsh produce was set down at 740 oz.
Some of the ore yielded only from 3 to 19 dwts. per ton ; but the
produce of the Dolgelly district was found in 1862 to yield 353 oz.
per ton. The works are still being carried on at a fair profit; but
the really rich spots are few in number, and do not attract any large
amount of capital or enterprise.
Ireland had a noticeable gold-fever in the last century. In 1796,
a little nugget of gold, weighing somewhat under half an ounce, was
found among the Wicklow Mountains. The news spread like wild-
fire. Male and female, young and old, rushed to Croghan Kinshela;
and gold to the value of �IO,OOO was found before the government
took any steps in the matter. Probably the storms of ages had
washed out numerous small bits of gold from the crevices of the
rocks ; but when this surface-store was exhausted, and arrangements
made for a deeper and more scientific exploration, it was found that
the expenses overbalanced the returns. And so died away the credit
of the ? Wicklow gold mines.?
Scotland has also had its periods of excitement arising from dis-
coveries of the precious metal; and as the recent Sutherland adven-
tures illustrate very well the forms which this excitement assumes,
a brief notice of the doings at Helmsdale will be welcome. Mr
Gilchrist, a native of Sutherland, while engaged at gold-digging in
Australia, was' struck with a similarity in appearance between some
of the creeks in the colony and those in Kildonan strath ; and on his
return home, he resolved to search for gold at the last-named place.
The most northern railway station in Great Britain is (1869) a t
Golspie, near Dunrobin Castle; 17 miles beyond this is the town
(or village) of Helmsdale ; and 10 miles west of Helmsdale he found
gold in the strath. The precious metal, in very small quantity, was
obtained from the mud or alluvial deposit of a burn which flowed
down from the hills. No sooner was this discovery noised abroad,
than adventurers flocked in from the neighbouring districts. There
being no town or village near the spot, the men took with them


blankets and poles to form tents, and a few implements and cooking
vessels of the simplest kind. During the winter of 1868-9, great
hardships were endured ; some of the men sleeping under canvas in
piercing cold, some trudging to and from Helmsdale every day.
The operations were of a very simple kind, involving no boring or
blasting. The diggers, with pickaxes and crowbars, broke up the
alluvial deposits which had been washed by the stream into the
crevices of the rocks. Basins, frying-pans, &c. were filled with this
earth, and washed in the stream until everything was washed away
but small spangles of gold. These spangles were so few as greatly
to dishearten most of the diggers. When washing apparatus of a
little better kind was used, the produce was somewhat increased.
In the month of August 1869, about 300 persons were employed at
Kildonan in gold-digging; and as bakers, butchers, and store-
dealers had followed in their wake, the semblance of a small colony
was making itself apparent. Indeed, two clusters of this singularly
located community invented Gaelic names for their settlements,
equivalent to ? Gold City? and ?Tent Town.? Not so much for the
sake of profit, as to avoid occasions for dispute, the Duke of Suther-
land granted licenses to the diggers, each for a certain area of
ground. Many experienced miners from Australia have expressed
a belief that the alluvial gold met with in Kildonan strath will be
small in quantity (the largest nugget recorded weighed only 2
oz. 20 grains) ; and that, if the precious metal exists in quartz
rock near at hand, it must be worked by better combinations of
labour and machinery than have hitherto reached that spot. The
Sutherland diggings have suggested the probability of gold deposits
being met with in many other parts of Scotland, especially in
the districts of Breadalbane, Braemar, Galloway, Lammermuir,
Tweedmuir, and the hilly parts of Argyle, Ross, and Inverness.
The Caledonian, the Deeside, and the Highland Railways give easy
access to many of these spots.
METHODS OF GOLD-MINING.
The foregoing pages convey some information concerning the pro-
cesses by which the precious metal is obtained from the soil. But it
may be desirable to give fuller particulars. The best way, perhaps,
will be to suppose a party of men going out to a new gold-district,
or to new diggings in a district already partially occupied?to begin
at the beginning, and thus trace the manner in which the operations
develop themselves.
It has been found by experience that a gold-digging party
should consist of not fewer than four people. To pursue the occu-
pation to the best advantage of health and comfort, and therefore
permanent profit, they should be provided with a small tent, with a
stock of blankets, and a sufficiency of coarse clothing to afford a


change from wet to dry, with a cradle, and a stock of pickaxes,
crowbars, and shovels. A wheel-barrow, a sieve or two, and one or
two flat tin dishes, like milk-pans, are also necessary. For food, a
stock of flour, of tea and sugar, and perhaps of salt pork, is neces-
sary. A strong, light one-horse dray or cart is about the best
conveyance on which to pack and carry these articles, the party
proceeding for the most part on foot. If they are going to explore
new ground, they should have some previous knowledge or experience
to guide them in the search, it being absolutely necessary that they
should know what kind of rock, or what kind of ground, will not
pi-oduce gold, in order that they may avoid wasting their time on it.
We will suppose them to have reached a probably auriferous region,
through which it is possible somehow to get their dray. They arrive
at the bed of a water-course or river, and they succeed in finding a
water-hole. The dray is stopped in the most convenient spot, and
set up for the night without unpacking. The horse is taken out and
watered, and then tethered in the best spot of grass that can be
found ; meanwhile a fire is lighted, and the kettle set on to boil.
If the ?damper? has been all exhausted at the last meal, one of the
party proceeds to make another after the following fashion : He
selects some smooth flat stone, or slab of rock, on which he lights a
fire, and accumulates a mass of glowing embers. He then takes
one of the tin dishes, half fills it with flour, which he mixes with
water into a stiff paste ; and when the slab of stone is sufficiently
heated, he brushes aside the embers, spreads the paste upon it, and
then piles the embers over it again, till it is baked into a roundish
fiat cake, about a foot in diameter, and an inch in thickness. But
whether a damper or a loaf, a rasher or a steak, tea or coffee, beer
or spirits, our party take their meal according to the exigencies of
the situation. The horse is re-watered and re-tethered in a fresh
locality, if necessary, and then wrapping himself in a blanket, each
man lies and sleeps where he finished his supper. If it were in a
very remote district, it would be wise if each one kept watch in
turn through the night, with a gun loaded in his hand, to guard
against possible mischief.
At earliest dawn, or before it, all hands would be astir, and while
one prepared the breakfast, and another attended to the horse, the
two others would probably be searching the bed of the river, or
prospecting for gold. Digging down at some sandy spot, spadeful
after spadeful of the earth would be carried in the tin pan to the
water, half immersed, and then gently agitated, and shaken round
and round till any particle of gold would have time to sink to the
bottom of the mass. The coarse stuff is frequently skimmed off and
thrown away, care being taken, of course, to throw away no visible
pebble or nugget of gold; and the washing and sifting continued
until nothing but a little sand, perhaps, is left, and this is carefully
examined to see if it contain gold. When gold occurs, and probably
s6


also when it does not, there is often found a heavy metallic sand,
said to be titaniferous iron ore (called in Australia ? emery ?), and
possibly other minerals in a fine state of comminution. Should
this trial be unsuccessful, our party pack up their traps, and continue
their journey, choosing the easiest and openest route for their cart,
which one or two of them accompany, while the others explore the
river at other places, or search in the beds of its lateral creeks.
Eventually, perhaps, they stumble on some rich diggings, when of
course they set up their tent, unpack their cradle and tools, and set
to work in real earnest. One of their number will then perhaps
have to start to the nearest town or station for a fresh supply of
provisions, and thus the news of their success becoming known,
other persons follow them, and a great camp, or perhaps the elements
of a town, is formed.
If, in place of exploring for themselves, our party go at once to
a well-known locality already partially occupied, they will of course
have to select a spot still untouched, or to purchase a partially
explored one. In either case, they will have a certain plot of ground
marked out for them, and each will have to take out a license to dig.
Having procured their licenses, settled their claims, set up their tent,
and made arrangement for the supply of food, the party set to work.
If they have any depth of soil or earth to clear away, it will be
necessary that two should work at the actual diggings, one should
wheel the earth to the cradle, which the fourth should rock and
keep supplied with water. The ordinary cradle very much resembles
in form the domestic article from which it takes its name. It is,
however, open at the foot; while at the head, instead of a hood, it
has a sieve fixed like a gravel-sifter?s ; and across the bottom, inside,
there are one or two cleats or wooden bars nailed.
On bringing the earth to the cradle, a shovelful of it is thrown
upon the sieve, and a ladleful of water poured over it. More earth
and more water are added alternately, the cradle all the while being
kept in motion by rocking, until the sieve is full of the larger pebbles
or fragments of rock. When that is the case, the sieve is carefully
examined, to see whether it contains any large nuggets of gold, and
the fragments are then thrown away. The water thrown into the
head of the cradle carries away all the mud and sand out at the
foot; but as its current is arrested by the cleats or bars across
the bottom, it deposits against them most of the golden dust and
scales that it contained. This common cradle is, however, a
rather wasteful contrivance, as a large quantity of the very finest
and thinnest gold-dust is apt still to be carried away with
the mud and sand out of the cradle, and lost. The Californian
cradle, is, therefore, adopted whenever it can be obtained. This
contains a compartment full of quicksilver, through which all the
mud and sand is made to pass. Now, quicksilver has such a love
for gold, and the affection is so mutual, that whenever they come in
ay


contact, they immediately unite and form an ? amalgam,? a compound
of gold and quicksilver, which it requires a very powerful heat to
dissolve. The quicksilver thus licks every particle of gold out of
the earth; and when the amalgam is put into a proper apparatus,
and the requisite heat applied, it is sublimed into fumes, lets go the
gold, which falls down pure, while the fumes may be caught in a
separate chamber, and recooled back into quicksilver again.
Whichever cradle they may use, our adventurers must now live a
life of great toil, of some hardship and privation, and of great
monotony. The rising sun must find them at their work, and when
setting, look with an approving eye as they are preparing only to
finish their labours. As the sun himself is, in those latitudes, a very
regular and steady-going character, rarely varying more than half
an hour from six o?clock in his rising and setting, this will give
twelve regular hours of labour throughout the year. To unwonted
hands and sinews, twelve hours at pickaxe and spade, even if varied
by a turn at the wheel-barrow, or at the water-scoop and cradle, are
quite sufficient to make sunset no unwelcome sight. Then comes
the hour of tea and damper, of lying at the tent-door in the cool air,
made fragrant by the evening pipe, with the dews falling around
from the clear Australian sky, in which the stars glisten and sparkle
like living gems?the hour of silence, broken only, perhaps, by the
distant howl of a wild-dog, or the 'plaintive cry of the thick-knee?d
plover, or perhaps by the confounded hum of half-a-dozen mosquitoes,
that come buzzing around you, looking for a soft place in which to
insinuate their long, stinging proboscides, and make you start from
your reveries, inclined to devote all the race of gnats as an offering
to the infernal deities. Still, wearied with the day?s toil, our party
sleep, in spite of mosquitoes and all other discomforts?soothed,
perhaps, by the remembrance of the ever-expanding little bag of
gold-dust, the reward of their labours. Even at their daily digging,
the constant chance of a rich prize, that may turn up at any moment,
tends to keep men to their work as no other inducement would, and
perpetuate an excitement which makes labour pass unnoticed, that,
under other circumstances, would be felt as irksome and distressing
beyond endurance.
With regard to the actual diggers at the two great scenes of
industry, it may be remarked that, unlike California, the order and
regularity among the gold-diggers of Australia, and especially of New
South Wales, has been something wonderful. A writer, speaking
of the period soon after the discovery, said : ? Sunday has been kept
sacred from toil, as it were by common consent, and in many places
service has been performed with great regularity. Disputes have
been referred to the commissioners, and their decision at once
accepted; and little robbery or violence has as yet taken place.
With the consciousness of this peace and order reigning among
so rough and miscellaneous an assemblage, it must be an interesting
28


sight to look down from some wooded eminence on one of these
auriferous valleys, to see the lines and clusters of tents of all kinds,
from the canvas marquee to the little bark ? gunyah,? gleaming in
the sunshine, or peeping out here and there among the bush ; and
to look on several thousand men, in red or blue woollen shirts, with
cabbage-tree hats, and ?bearded like the pard,? all busily and
eagerly intent on their work ; some digging, some wheeling and
carrying, some washing and rocking, each acting independently,
and yet all working together, with a willingness, intentness, and
pertinacity, that nothing but the expectation of immediate gain could
rouse in so many men at once. Notwithstanding the business and
the work, or perhaps in consequence of it, silence is said to reign
over the scene, undisturbed except by the hum of the rocker or
the wheel-barrow, or the taps of the picks.?
But we must now say something concerning the quartz diggings.
The underground working for gold does not differ materially in
character from that of metallic minerals generally. In some
districts a band of rock contains veins of quartz in which gold is
disseminated ; and the mining processes depend in detail on the
direction which the veins take?access being obtained by vertical
shafts and lateral galleries. The auriferous vein may be quartzose,
or talc-slate, or pyritical, or any one of many different kinds, and
the mining processes vary somewhat according to this circumstance ;
but in Australia and California the predominant gold-vein is quartz.
In one place the vein averages about three feet in width, and stands
vertically between walls of talcose slate; in others, talcose or
quartzose, the vein is horizontal, inclined, or even tortuous. A
vein sometimes thins away to nothing; and one vein may contain
a hundred-fold as much gold as another. The actual facts cannot
be ascertained without excavating, A shaft may be twenty or thirty
feet deep, or may be (and is in some instances) as much as five
hundred feet. Subject to exceptions here and there, a quartz vein
will yield gold down to a certain depth, then gold and mundic (iron
pyrites and other minerals), and finally mundic without gold. There
is thus much of the excitement of speculation in quartz-mining,
though not so much as in nugget-searching and sand-washing. The
mode of sinking shafts and driving galleries does not differ materially
from that adopted in the copper and tin mines of Cornwall; nor
does the employment of the blasting-fuse, the pick, and the shovel
need description. The upper-ground works connected with this
kind of gold-mining embrace the following: (i.) The quartz or other
vein-ore, brought up in pieces of any size, is crushed to a fine
powder, usually by means of a stamping-mill worked by steam or
water-power. (2.) The powder is plentifully washed with water, to
carry off all the quartz and light mineral matter. (3.) Mercury or
quicksilver is added to the remaining powder (that which contains
the gold); the mercury and the gold unite by their intense affinity,


effect a separation from all other substances, and form an amalgam.
(4.) This amalgam is exposed to heat in a suitable furnace or oven ;
the gold separates as pure metal; while the mercury rises in vapour,
which is afterwards condensed again by cold into a liquid for further
use, with very little waste.
SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION OF GOLD.
Concerning the total quantity of gold in the world, there are
many difficulties in the way of arriving at a just judgment. The
annual addition to the existing stock of bullion or uncoined gold,
which used to average about � 5,000,000, took a sudden leap imme-
diately after the Californian discoveries. The bullion-dealers of
Europe received, from that year to 1857, quantities averaging about
�20,000,000 every year. Still the wealth went on increasing. Mr
Jacob some years ago calculated that there was gold coin in the
whole world to the value of something like �380,000,000; but the
great discoveries within the last twenty-two years must have largely
increased this amount. England, in the last ten years, has coined
80,000,000 sovereigns; while France has exceeded this value, in the
gold pieces of that country. According to the latest estimate, the
annual produce of gold and silver mines now averages about
,�40,000,000, of which three-fourths is gold. The whole quantity
now existing, and in use, is roughly guessed at �300,000,000.
We may readily suppose that none of this gold and silver is wil-
fully or wantonly wasted yet it is found that the ordinary wear and
tear amounts to something considerable in the course of a year. In
one of the magazines, there was recently (1869) the following curious
information on this subject: ? Gold coins wear away with singular
regularity. Very few of them are hoarded; for nearly all classes are
conversant with the fact that it is better to invest than to hoard, better
to have money out at interest than idle in a box or an old stocking;
and thus most gold coins go through about an equal amount of hard
work. A sovereign of good sterling gold remains legally current
until it has lost three-quarters of a grain in weight, after which time
it becomes ? light," in which state any one may refuse to take it [in
legal payment of a debt]; and so proportionately of the half-sove-
reign. Now, it is found that a sovereign generally becomes ?light"
in about eighteen years, and a half-sovereign in ten years ; the
difference being due to the fact, that the surface of a half-sovereign
is much more than half that of a sovereign, and is therefore exposed
to proportionately harder usage. ... If a sovereign is set to work
on the Ist of January, it becomes lessened in value by the 31st of
December to the extent of one-third of a farthing. A trifle certainly;
but when we consider that nearly all the sovereigns are wearing
away at the same rate during the same time, we shall see that the
aggregate of trifles assumes a form very much like �30,000 a year.


This is a remarkable instance of unintentional and unavoidable
waste ; the particles of gold disappear, no one knows whither/
Some further remarks illustrate one of the curiosities of trade : ? A
sovereign passed at the west end of London meets with better usage
in such shops as jewellers? or milliners? than it does when rung with
a strong arm on the counter of a potato salesman, where it would
be rubbed by the sand. In commercial towns, the coin becomes
light sooner than in other places ; not only from its greater circula-
tion, but in consequence of the rough usage it undergoes in being;
so often thrown into bankers? scales and drawers.?
It is hardly possible to form even a rough estimate of the quantity
of gold used for purposes other than coinage. Many years ago, it
was calculated that Birmingham used �50,000 worth of gold annually
in making pencil-cases, eye-glasses, ear-rings, studs, buttons, and
miscellaneous trinkets; but the quantity must now be very much
larger, owing to the great increase of trade in that busy town, and
especially to the introduction of electro-gilding. The quantity used,
by goldsmiths, jewellers, gilders, &c. all over the world, must of
course be very large : it has been recently estimated at �15,000,000
annually?Bo per cent, new metal, and 20 per cent. old.
Not the least curious among the facts connected with this subject
is the very small amount of actual waste which occurs in gold and
golden commodities. True (as was stated in a former paragraph),
the wear and tear of our English sovereigns in the course of a year
amounts to a value sufficient to attract the attention of financiers ;
but this amount is very trifling compared with the whole quantity
over which it is spread. Every grain of gold is more care-
fully shielded from destruction than a grain of any other sub-
stance with which we are familiar. Not only do we preserve
coin, plate, gold and gilt jewellery, &c. as long as possible, but
every scrap is melted and re-melted over and over again, to be
converted into new forms. Even the dust and refuse in goldbeaters 7
and jewellers? workshops are eagerly bought, to obtain the minute
particles of gold out of them by burning, washing, melting, and
other processes. A working goldbeater can obtain a new waistcoat
in exchange for his old one, for the sake of the minute bits of gold
which cling to it. From these usages it results that very little gold
is actually wasted, lost, dissipated for ever ; nearly all of it takes a
new and useful life again. Where the lost particles go to, no one
can say; to a certain limited extent we eat gold, drink gold, walk
upon gold, impregnate the cloth of our pockets and the wood of our
desks and drawers with gold.
Has the great increase in the supply of gold within the last few
years materially lessened its exchangeable value, and so raised the
prices of other commodities? Opinions have greatly differed on
this point; but in the latest edition of M?Culloch?s Dictionary of
Commerce (1B69), the question is answered in the negative. Gold

GOLD AND GOLD-DIGGERS.
and silver are taken together, as ?precious metals ;? and the matter
is presented in the following light : The yearly addition to the gold
and silver in the world is roughly estimated at .�40,000,000. Of
this, per cent will be wanted to replace wear and tear, loss, &c.
amounting to �7,500,000. The currency in the whole world being
set down at �500,000,000, about 2 per cent on this is needed for
the increase of coined money to meet the demands of increasing
commerce : this will absorb �10,000,000. Then, it is supposed that
�15,000,000 worth of gold and silver is used in new plate, goldsmiths?
work, &c.; and as one-fifth of this is obtained by melting up old
gold and silver articles, there remains a demand for �12,000,000 of
new metal annually. These three sums make up a total of
�29,500,000, which, subtracted from �40,000,000, leaves a residue of
�10,500,000. It is believed that this residue will be brought down
still lower by the increase in gold and silver luxuries (beyond the
present annual rate), which society in the aggregate will be able to
afford. So that it comes to this ; there will not be a surplus of such
amount as materially to affect prices. ? The present supply of the
precious metals is not more than adequate to meet the average
existing demand; there is therefore no ground for anticipating a
fall in their value, unless the supply should be increased, or the
demand diminished.? After twenty-one years of Californian and
eighteen of Australian supply of gold, there is nothing like a general
rise in prices. ? There is in truth nothing whatever, in comparing
the prices of to-day with those of twenty years ago, to entitle any
one to affirm that the value of gold and silver has undergone any
appreciable change in the interval.? Moreover, ?in all speculations
in regard to the probable future supply of gold, it should be carefully
borne in mind, that any considerable fall in its value would unavoid-
ably check its production, and consequently tend to lessen or prevent
its further fall. It is plain, for example, that a decline of ten per
cent, in the value of gold, would, cceteris paribus , occasion the
abandonment of all those mines, diggings, washings, &c., which
already only yield a nett profit of that amount.?
