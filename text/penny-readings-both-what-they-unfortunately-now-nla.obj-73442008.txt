15 August, 1866.
To all whom it may concern !
No man has a 'right, as man among men, to occupy the place of
Instructor, unless convinced that his peculiar opportunities, his more
assiduous or happier studies, have furnished him with advantages which
the majority of his hearers or readers have not enjoyed, or, not improved.
There is, however, an essential difference between conscious capability
and shameless assurance ; the former may not only exist without presump-
tion, but, even its open avowal may be perfectly compatible with modesty;
while the latter is simply the genuine offspring of unadulterated arrogance
?therefore, ? Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that
you may the better judge.?
On 14 November, 1821, I established (without anyone?s aid) a
? Reading and Reciting Society,? in one of the Capitals of Europe; where
Ladies and Gentlemen (not Boys and Girls) met weekly, for rational enter-
tainment and mutual improvement.
In the winter of 1822, I established, in another City (5 hours distant
from the Capital) a ? Literary Society,? which was not only frequented by
the most respectable inhabitants (male and female) but, regularly attended
by several of the Professors as well as Students of the University. I was
sole Manager of both Societies ; consequently, I never had an opportunity
of quarreling, nor even caviling, with any fellow-director; my Will was
Law, and I but seldom fell out with myself. The winter series usually
extended over twelve weeks. I delivered an hour?s Lecture, and, after a
pause of 5, 10, or 15, minutes (during which, refreshments were presented
to the Ladies?the Gentlemen taking care of themselves) we had an hour?s,
sometimes an hour and a half s, ? Readings and Recitations,? in which I
was readily and ably assisted by the Members.
Laziness never was my besetting sin; for, even when I might havo
3d myself the pains of preparing two lectures a week, I preferred


delivering distinct Courses at the two Societies, and gave distinct Selections
for ? Reading and Recitation"?l could not endure the wearisome repeti-
tions of the same Pieces, by the same Readers, which is submissively
tolerated in Melbourne. I have all my Lectures (from 14 Nov. 1821, to
the present time) and on looking them over today, I find the following
twenty-four Lectures to have been delivered, in twelve consecutive weeks,
during the winter season of 1822?1823, when twelve might have sufficed.
On Narrative stylo, \
? Descriptive, Accompanied with Instructions relating to tho
? Didactic, I special Delivery suited to each stylo; and tho
? Argumentative, Instructions elucidated, by the Delivery of a
? Monologue, &c. and rich variety of Specimens, from eminent writers.
? Sacred. ,
On the Interrogation,
? Exclamation,
? Parenthesis,
? Commencement,
? Contrast,
? Series,
? Question & Answer,
? Echo,
? Antecedent,
? Valuation, and
? Cadence.
These Figures of Pronunciation, I
Explained to the Auditors; and then
taught their proper Delivery, by tho
distinct utteraueo of the Figures them-
selves, from examples occurring in good
writers.
After delivering twelve Lectures on the preceding subjects in tho one
City, I delivered, in tho other City, twelve Lectures on the Genius and
Writings of
Shakespeare,
Milton,
Dryden, Tho delivery of these 12 Lectures, at that critical
Addison, period of my life, did me a world of good; they
Pope, gave me a fillip, which has not yet lost its effect:
Swift, 1 I knew that I had some wide-awake, satirical Pro-
Byron, f fessors among my constant hearers; and that
Young, spurred me to the acquisition of an intimate Know-
Goldsmith, ledge of my subjects ?all those esteemed Critics
Johnson, are now, where Knowledge is not known !
Cowper, and
Byron.
Though I re-opened these ? Literary Recreations" winter after winter,
some seasons passed before I could prevail on Ladies to take an active
part?and, strange to say, not only is the very first Icebreaker now in
Melbourne, but others, who aided me on the Continent of Europe 40 years
ago, and in London a dozen years back, I have lived to shake hands with
in Victoria; and if I become Young again (which some tell me I shall do,
in a year or two) we old European offenders may, perhaps, give a Public
Reading for the benefit of some charitable Institution, that the difference
between Reading and Mumbling, between Reading and Spouting, may
be made apparent, and thoroughly understood, felt, and appreciated.
Ladies are tho most desirable Coadjutors, as they (generally) Read
mr better, and much more pleasingly, than Gentlemen. I seldom


experienced any difficulty in obtaining ample active assistance from the
frequenters of Readings, after the first evening or two, in a strange locality ;
and in London, I succeeded in enlisting several Ladies, in different parts
of the Metropolis, to exercise themselves publicly, in the Art of Heading,
to the gratification of the auditors and their own lasting benefit.
Hence, long before the so-called Penny Headings came into vogue,
I had established (without any fuss or difficulty) a variety of similar
Readings?and many of the most pleasurable of my hours during the last
45 years, have been spent in the enjoyment of such literary recreations.
On 8 November, 1860, I opened (under difficulties) a ? Reading
Society,? in South Wales, Admission Free ; but, experience taught me
to make the admission One Penny the following winter, and Twopence
for ? Reserved seats??the Pence furnishing ample funds to provide a
good stock of Books for the Readers, without soliciting pecuniar}? aid from
the well-to-do inhabitants. Notwithstanding the opposition evinced by
certain narrow-minded Sectarists (who fancied that they alone ought to
Instruct the people) I battled the contemplated Society into existence, and
my efforts were crowned with signal success ; for our Meetings were full
to overflowing.
But, unlike all the Penny Headings I have seen or heard of in
Victoria, the Mechanics, the Artisans , the Laborers, were the most
numerous active members?the Working classes, after encouraging
invitations, voluntarily presented themselves as ? Readers on the next
week?s List.? Printed Lists of the Pieces and their Readers, were to be
had some days before the Readings took place; so that all who wished to
be doubly and trebly benefited by them, had the opportunity of reading
and studying most of the Pieces beforehand. The carrying out of this
arrangement, which was thrown intirely on my hands, produced what is
called a sensation, among the Laboring-classes; they eagerly met
together in coteries, after the toils of the day; read over, and talked over,
the Pieces ; acquired a knowledge of their import, and could judge pretty
well, on the night of Delivery, in how far the Readers did justice to
the Pieces to which their names stood appended. In this way a Love of
Heading was Created among many families, where Books had previously
been as rare as Banknotes, and the social and moral elevation of many,
was visible to all men. The Publicans felt it sensibly.
My reason for thus stating to my unknown Readers, how long and
repeatedly I have been engaged in establishing and managing Public
Readings, is, to impress upon your minds, that my Remarks on the
Victorian Penny Headings are founded on matured experience?therefore,
entitled to more consideration than the remarks of a Novice. At any rate,
I trust the thinking reader of these pages may be generous enough, to
attribute my censures to laudable motives; and to accept advice from an
unknown ? New Chum ? who, certainly, knows more about Public
Readings than anyone else in the Colony?be he who he may.
Our great moral Teacher tells us (in ? Timon of Athens?) We are
born to do Benefits ?and as I am on what some folks call the wrong


side of Seventy, if I do not look sharp in communicating tho little which
a long and active life has tanght, tho Worms will bo at mo, before I shall
have half-accomplished what seems set down for me to do here.
To all who have anything to do with the Management of Penny
Readings, I would say (as kindly and respectfully as urgently and
ndmonishingly) Let your object be twofold? the Entertainment and
Improvement of the Masses of the People. Never think of merely
A tiling an hour or two of their Time ; but select, and strenuously exact
the selection of such Pieces as contain real information, such as convey
intellectual light, at the same time they afford rational amusement: a slice
or two of ? good nonsense? may occasionally be introduced, with happy
effect?but never admit of grossness, indelicacy, nor immorality, however
funny, however comical, however laughable. If judiciously conducted,
Penny Readings may be instrumental in accomplishing much real good
in whatever neighbourhood they may be carried on ; not only withdrawing
hundreds from mischief and tho haunts of vice, but, actually raising them
in the scale of Humanity?by imparting, through the medium of choice
Pieces, considerable useful knowledge and many lessons of wisdom.
Through appropriate Pieces effectively delivered, you may vastly enlarge
the conceptions of the uneducated ; you may virtually ennoble their minds
in feeling and in purpose?which would be educating, humanizing ,
exalting, civilizing, the Masses.
But (alas) not One of the Penny Readings I have attended in
Melbourne or its vicinity, seemed to have tho remotest aproximation
towards informing the head or amending the heart ; tho best that I can
say of the best of them, is?there was plenty of noise, abundance of merri-
ment, and lots of fun, accompanied with deafening applause, long-continued
clapping of hands, and execrable whistlings 1 The fact is, the Getters-up of
these Penny Readings have committed a capital blunder, in meddling
with what they know nothing about; for, they have not any idea what
Penny Readings should be, and may be, and must be. If it be worth
while to have Penny Readings at all, it must necessarily be worth while
to have them properly and advantageously conducted; because, whatever
is worth doing, is worth doing well.
Such Penny Platforms should never be erected for conceited over-
grown Children to strutt before the Masses, and spout out their nothingness
at pleasure ; they ought not to be occupied by Town Councillors, Mayors,
Members of Parliament, and men of �lOO or �l,OOO a-day, for the sole
purpose of showing themselves off, and asking (with an air of self- approval)
of the gaping crowd? Now don t you think I'm a very clever Fellow ?
When men of note and notability ascend Penny Platforms for the
purpose of giving Countenance to the institution (whether they read or
not) their presence will be felt and respectfully acknowledged by all parties ;
when Public Readers (whether Elocutionists, Theologians, or Actors) take
an active part in the Readings, their friendly assistance will be thankfully
accepted by all: but, the Penny Platform is not their Platform ; it is the
Platform of the Masses, and the Masses must have the use of it?occasion-
ally accepting, which they are sure to do with thankfulness, the guidance


and aid of thoir betters. Help them, stimulate them, encourage them, by
all means; but, do not kick them aside as altogether incompetent to carry
on Penny Readings for themselves?as many a Laboring man (to my
certain knowledge) would Read a Piece from Shakespeare, Milton, or Byron,
with considerably more efl?oct, than many a would-be-great Somebody ;
and, an unassuming Mechanic would speedily reduce the consequentialness
of many a vainglorious Well-to-do, if once caught in the mesh of an
arguement.
Were it not for the appearance of invidionsness, I should here print a
copy of some one of the Programs of the Readings I have attended, that
I might comment both on the Pieces and the Readers, by way of
elucidating, clearly and unmistakably, wherein, and how far, they fell
short of what they ought to have been?Pieces of verbiage, trash, rubbish ;
disgracefully ill-read, or, pitifully spouted; with scarcely any redeeming
points.
Fortunately, I have not been mixed-up with any of them?though I
once was imprudent enough to expose myself to the risk. I read, in The
Argus of 8 August, the following genteel mode of Begging assistance?
A number of gentlemen met at the town clerk?s office, East Collingwood, last night,
with the object of initiating a series of penny readings. Mr. Noone, mayor of the
borough, presided. After some consideration it was determined to request the service
of several popular lecturers; and if the proposed arrangements can be carried out,
the first reading will be given on the 10th inst. in the borough council chambers.?
Well, thought I, rather than the Penny Readings shall not be
established, of which a doubt, is expressed as to the carrying out of the
design, and as a modest request is made for my services, I will give them
a lift, and set them fairly a-going: so, I penned a short but full Note to
the said Mayor (and posted it myself) informing him?lf he would take
the trouble of calling upon mo (inclosing my Card) all the difficulties of
carrying out the wished-for Readings , might be at once removed?
fortunately for me, Mr. Noone had not the common courtesy to take any
notice whatever of my well-intended offer; whereby, |I happily escaped
becoming associated with that sadly Mismanaged undertaking 1 On 9
August, I was present at the Opening (Independent Schoolroom, East
Collingwood) when the Chairman (the Mayor) and all the Readers, first
made their appearance on the Platform, considerably behind the appointed
time.
Here I must pause, to have a rap at a piece of consummate impudence, very
prcva?ent in Melbourne and its neighbourhood, namely?The fixing a time for the
commencement of a public meeting, and then, not keeping to the fixed time ; this
species of robbery I never can look upon forgivingly, as a little attention is all that is
requisite to avoid it. As Mr. Noone is not very ready with his pen, perhaps, it
may not be amiss if I put down for him on paper, the approximate amount of Time
he stole from me and others, on the evening of 9 August?namely 200 hours. Not-
withstanding the multitudinous and important engagements of Lord Brougham, no
reader of this Censure on lack of Punctuality, can quote the day, within the last 60
years, that his Lordship was not in the Chair at the minute I


The young gentleman who conducted me to the East Collingwood
Penny Readings on the 9th, pressed mo to accompany him to the Fitzroy
Penny Readings (in the Court House, Market Square) on the 18th. I
cannot help feeling intensely interested in whatever relates to the Masses,
and have, at personal inconvenience, attended several Public Readings this
winter ; but O dear, O dear! how very unlike what they ought
to have been, might and could and would have been, had the Managers
been the right men in the right places 1 had they been but well-read in
English literature: but (alas) the Selections of the Pieces and their
lamentable Delivery,, warrant my declaring thus publicly, that I consider
myself as having been "Sold" in every instance, and invariably ? Done
out of my enterauco money !?
As to the Individual speculators on the know-nothingness of a passing-by
Public, I leave them to their merited fate?desertion and contempt; but,
I shall not abandon the Penny Readings without an attempt to rouse
the really Philanthropic to come to the rescue, and either re-model the
Mismanaged ones, or, establish New ones on a better footing. All those
I have attended, possess the seeds o"f their own dissolution within them-
selves?bad taste, puerility, ignorance of the requisites to keep them in
being?nor can the recently introduced hybridism preserve them from
destruction !
At nearly all the so-called Readings I have been at, so : callcd
Singing , and so-called Playing, were unblushingly presented to me, as
so much Music, occupying most of the Reading-time. Now, though
Music is very well in its place (especially Music which has charms to
recommend it) Beading and Music should not be amalgamated ; nor does
good Reading require any such injurious accompaniment: and surely,
with 500 sterling Poets and 5,000 admirable Prosaists at command, there
need not bo any dearth of intellectual enjoyment and rational amusement
for years to come. I have catered for the same Public, winter after winter,
for upwards of a quarter of a century, without exhausting the rich stores
of our literature?l never was driven to the necessity of giving a single
Reading from either of the two daily hackneyed Melbourne favorites,
Dickens and Tennyson?during 45 years? Public Reading, I have not yet
read One piece from these considerably over-rated ephemeral writers, whose
works will perish with them.
Without obtruding myself on the notice of any Public Reader, I have
contrived to worm out of several of them, their Opinions of the Masses
they so frequently address, and regarding whom, they employ the
expressions ?vulgar-herd????senseless rabble???the illiterate clods,?
etc., and I was surprised as well as pained, to hear their disparaging
notions of the capacities of those ?uncultivated minds,? those ?unlettered
multitudes ; while the fact is, many among the unlettered Listeners are
far superior, in feeling and intellect, to the consequential Usurpers of the
Penny Platform?many unlettered Listeners, have educated minds, far in
advance of the scientifically-schooled Speakers and Readers. This may
be inapprehensible to some of our Contemners of ? the gaping crowds,?
but, look at the ancient Athenians, whom all allow to have been the most
intelligent Community the world has yet seen; what was the amount of


their scientific education ? On examination it will be found, there were
but few of those who conquered the Persians, who gazed on the Parthenon,
who listened to Pericles, who felt and applauded the genius of Eschylus
and Sophocles, but very few who knew either to write or to read! If
asked, What taught them to be so aspiring, yet practical ? so valiant, yet
humane ? so wise, and yet so unlettered ? I should answer, Why oven
that which teaches unschooled Englishmen?the conversations and habits
of everyday life?the custom of self-government?the consciousness of
liberty?the electrical transit of stirring ideas, caused by the common
interest of public affairs?the constant intercourse between man and man
?that fearless publicity of opinion and magic sympathy of united members ;
these are the mighty influences, the natural communications to the multi-
tude, of the useful knowledge and vivid thoughts which genius or study
originates in the fern ?these are the great inlets which instruct English-
men generally, which give to our unlettered Masses their vast superiority
over the Masses of other nations.
Teaching a man to read and write and cipher is not educating him ;
that is merely Instruction ; pouring the thoughts of other men into his
head?not developing the man?s own mind : but, to inspire a man with a
consciousness of his own moral worth ; to make him a thinking , an
intelligent, a reflective being; improving him in his domestic and social
relations ; guiding his conduct and elevating his character, this is an Educa-
tion worthy of the name. What is Instruction good for, if it fail to make us
miser and better members of Society ? If the given Instruction does not
elevate our nature, by imparting sound moral qualifications ; if it does not
enrich our experience, by energetic and practical ideas; if it does not
instil ennobling principles : it is (in my estimation) little else than a
Bounding brass, little better than a tinkling cymbal. Knowledge is good,
but, Wisdom is better.
? Knowledge and Wisdom, far from being One,
Have ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells
In heads replete with thoughts of Other men ;
Wisdom in minds attentive to their Own.?
The grand mistake which the well-meaning Inaugurates of the
Victorian Penny Readings have made, principally consists in their false
estimates of the capabilities of the men and women who frequent such
gatherings ; neither do they seem to know that moral cultivation is of higher
moment, than even what is considered the necessary parts of human learn-
ing?especially in the dawning of reason. Scientific knowledge
may be, more or less, advantageous in after life, but, all parties
(high and low, rich and poor) are responsible as moral agents ; and
Parents and Guardians (however circumstanced) are unquestionably bound
to teach Children their duty towards God and towards Man. The
knowledge that relates to the ordinary concerns of life, may be forgotten?
correct principles once infused into the mind, and clearly apprehended
there, never can be eradicated! they may be neglected, they may be
perverted; but, the consciousness of their truth will remain : for, the
judgement recognizes, and the conscience approves, what the Will too


often disowns. Hence the philosophy as well as morality of that well-
known admonition?
? Train up a Child in the way ho should go, and when he is Old he will
not depart from it.?
The Managers of Penny Headings ought to aim at making amends
for the negligences and deprivations of early life among their less favored
fellow creatures; imparting, through the production of fitting Pieces,
suitable information to the Masses?or, leave the superintendence
of such popular Readings, to those better qualified to carry out what ought
to be the two-fold object of such institutions for the People.
I do not wish to conceal my indignation at the low appreciation put
upon the frequenters of Penny Readings , by the Readers and Reciters
and Spouters themselves! and I am bold to tell all such Well-to-do
depreciated of the capacities of ? the Unlettered multitude,? that the
greatest Poets, Orators, Philosophers, Statesmen, Men of Business,
Scholars, Inventers and Improvers of Arts and Sciences, have arisen from
what they haughtily look down upon as ? the inferior grades ? of Society.
Had mankind waited till nobles and princes had invented the Art of
Printing, Clockmaking, and Navigation; till the silk-gowned and white-
chokered gentry (who graciously consider themselves the superior classes)
had invented Spinning-jennies, Steam-engines, Steamboats, Railroads, and
Electric-telegraphs, the world would still have been without them at this
hour ! What do the histories of nations teach us ? Why, that these
very so-called Superior classes (bating a few honorable exceptions)
have been the direst enemies of mankind?the instigaters of injustice,
wretchedness, and crime?the abetters of tyranny, the promoters of oppres-
sion, the annihilaters of their own species ! Such is the testimony of the
histories of nations?such the deeds done by the men that Accident more
than Merit has rewarded with honors and titles, and endowed with rich
revenues, principalities, and crowns! while most of the meliorations and
nearly all the inventions and improvements tending to raise men above
brutes, have originated among that order in Society which the purse-proud
and the idle, the arrogant and the know-nothings, call plebeian !
I cannot refrain from telling the Mis-managers and the self-conceited
Readers and Spouters, who fancy that the Masses they address are nothing
but Babies of a larger growth, that there is a singular vigor of mind, as
well as energy of body, in those who have been out of the reach of luxury
and corruption; whose obscure position has preserved them uncontami-
nated by the pestilence of iniquity which is breathed within the precincts
of courts, and the dwellings of the affluent; and when such minds have
become improved by competent education and subsequent opportunities of
observation and experience, we behold in them the highest degrees of mental
excelence I
This eulogy on our ? Unlettered Multitudes,? may, perhaps, be called
rant and cant by the censured Managers of the Penny Readings I have
attended; and be looked upon, by the presumptuous Readers of unsuitable
Pieces, as bombast and bunkum; but, before I let them pass out of my


hands, I must toll these Usurpers of the office of Instructors of ** illite-
rate clods? and the ? senseless rabble,? that?
James Hogg (better known, perhaps, as The Ettrick Shephrd) was
first a Cowherd, before ho was deemed capable of watching Sheep; that
when 20 years of ago, he could not even Hoad ; and that ho had, in
all, ? but half-a-ycar?s schooling, such as it was.? Ferguson, professor of
Astronomy at the university of Oxford, commenced his studies of the
heavenly bodies while tending Sheep on the Highlands of Scotland. Dr.
Alexander Murray, professor of Oriental languages at the High School of
Edinburgh, made frequent mention, to the Students, of his Shepherd-life.
Doth prior and sequent to the royal psalmist (David the son of Jesse)
Shepherds have, in many countries, risen to bo eminent men.
But, I shall restrict my examples to our own Countrymen ; as a whole
sheet could not contain a bare list of the great men of other countries,
which crowd upon my memory. I might have commenced even lower in
the scale of avocations than Shepherds ; for, Pope Sixtus the Vth, of
Spanish Armada notoriety, the Spanish commander Pizarro, and the
celebrated antiquary Duval, were all Swineherds. If I allowed myself to
instance great men of other lands, who, as the saying is, ? Sprang from
Nothing,? ?Attained eminence under Difficulties,? I should have to enu-
merate the 8 p?cat poets, to whom the classical of all nations still con-
tinue to pay obeisance?Homer the blind Beggar, Virgil the Son of a Pottery-
baker, and Horace the Grandson of a Freedman?the 8 great Reformers
of Europe?Martin Luther, who sang songs from door to door, for half-
pence, and even ? begged his bread,? in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg ;
Ulrich Zwingle, the Son of a Peasant ; and Calvin, the last of the triumvi-
rate, the Son of a Cooper. I should have to mention, that Esop, and
Terence, and Publius Syrus, and Epictetus, among the ancients, and, in
our own day, Lot, and Carey, and Douglas, and Ward, with many other
public instructers, were all of them Slaves?yet slavery itself could not
keep their minds in bondage ! Hence, the expediency of restricting my
examples to British subjects only. Besides, what one of our own country-
men has accomplished, others need not be afraid of attempting.
I can't never effected anything greatly good, or, trucly great; Til try
has accomplished wonders; and I will has reduced mountains to mole-
hills, has shaken off impossibilities, like dewdrops from a lion?s mane!
Wisdom and Fortune combating together,
If that the former dare but what it can,
No chance may shake it. Antony and Cleopatra.
On 24 June, 1831, Lord Brougham (one of our marvelous walking
Encyclopedias) said, very characteristically?l always think it time enough
to say I can't, when I have tried and failed. Whenever a man says I
cant, before he has tried, we may conclude that he means I won't."
The well-known lecturer on experimental philosophy, Martin, like
Cobbett, ? the man of all work,? was an agricultural Laborer ?and Crom-


well's favorite admiral, Blake, was the Son of a Peasant. The incomparable
Burns, and the recently deceased Greek professor at the Edinburgh
university, like our still living (as I hope) Alexander Somerville, once
? Whistled at the Plow.? Bishop Latimer (the martyr) and Butler, tho
author of Hudihras (a poem full of bullion) and Thomas Charles, one of
the originators of ? Tho Bible Society,? like Mungo Park, and our
? Champion of Freetrade,? my esteemed and lamented friend Cobdeu, were
all Sons of petty Farmers.
Anderson, the able translator of Archimedes , and author of a
General view of tho East India Company's affairs, like Thomas Edwards,
of Nant (near Denbigh) well-known for his literary Interludes , was a day
Laborer?and among the Sons of Laborers, may bo enumerated such
model-men as Dr. John Leyden, poet, antiquary, and orientalist, who
died (1811) in the BGth year of his age.
? That whelp Chatterton,? the wonder of his day, who duped tho
whole literary world, by tho issue of his clever Imitations of writers of
former times, was a Charity-boy. Our chaste sculptor Sir Francis
Chantrey, who nobly bequeathed all his valuable possessions to his Country,
was first a poor Sand-boy, then a Milk-boy, near Sheffield. Pridcaux swept
out Exeter college, Oxford, untill ho became promoted to tho drudgery of
the Kitchen ; then rose to bo assistant Cook ; and contrived (nobody knows
how) to acquire tho rudiments of Education: ho, however, swept and
cooked and studied to some purpose ; for, after having x*aiscd himself to tho
high honor of being elected Vice-chancellor of the university, he became
?the learned Lord bishop of Worcester.?
From the Stable sprang General Hoche, who (in 1796) commanded
the expedition against ill-fated and mis-govenxed Ireland. Keats, a youth
of extraoi?dinarj? promise, who fell tho victim of an illiberal critique, was
borxx in Livery-stable kept by his grandfather.
Stone, the astonishing Geometrician?and that canny Scotsman Paul
Jones (a man more sinned against than sinning) and tho elegant writer
William Roscoe, were Sons of Gardeners?while the late Joliu Moore,
archbishop of Canterbury, was tho Son of a Grazier.
Belzoni, tho famous traveler in Egypt, first supported himself by ex-
hibiting ? Feats of Strength,? in English villages. George Buchanan,
one of the greatest ornaments of Scotch Literature, ranks in tho Register
of the Glasgow university ? a pauper.? Dr. Adam, who died (1809)
Rector of the High School of Edinburgh, lodged for some time in a
small back room in that Capital, for which he with difficulty managed to
pay 4d. a-week. Curran, who in after life was wont to thrill his auditors
by the flashes of his genius and the original outpourings of his oratoi-y,
was indebted to the compassion of Boyse for his ? Alphabet and Grammar,
together with the rudiments of the Classics.? Crabbe, the poet, was res-
cued from crushing Poverty, through the philanthropy of the great Edmund
Burke. Erskine, whom Lord Campbell has registered in his Lives of
the Lord Chancellors, as ? the brightest ornament of which the Euglislx


Bar can boast, was bom in a small and ill-furnished room, in an upper
flat, of a very lofty house, in the Old town of Edinburgh."
Johnson, ?the Colossus of English literature," not only knew the
want of a Dinner, but had, occasionally, to walk the streets all night, for
want of a Lodging. However painful it may bo for us to think of such a
man as Johnson?s living in luxurious London on 4jd- a Day, we may thank
his Poverty for the stores of Riches he has left us; for, we have abundant
proofs of his constitutional indolence. According to his own confession,
? Burton?s Anatomy of Melancholy" was the only book that ever got him
out of bed two hours before his usual late time of rising. Instead of re-
gretting, wo may rejoice at his not having received a pension of �BOO from
Government, as an acknowledgement of his literary labors, untill the close
of his 53rd year; for, had Johnson been in easy circumstances, and not
constrained to write for bread, wo never should have had twelve octavo
volumes of his valuable writings in addition to his Dictionaries, Parlia-
mentary Debates, Sermons, and other compositions. Sir Francis North
(better known by his acquired title of Lord Keeper Guilford) himself
acscribed his wonderful success to his Poverty. Had it not been for a
blessed Adversity, such men as Johnson and Dryden and Goldsmith, would
never have penned so many volumes for Posterity. Hence,
? There is some soul of Goodness in things Evil,
Would men observingly distil it out. Henry V.
Rare Ben Jonson worked for several years as a Bricklayer ; and it was
said of him, ? while ho had the trowel in his hand, he had a hook in his
pocket, and a plot in his head." Allen Cunningham, also Edward
Williams, known in the literary world both as a Welch and English poet,
and still more renowned as an antiquarian?like the admired pulpit orator
Jay (of Bath) and the recently over-worked Hugh Miller, geologist and
author, were Stonemasons.
Inigo Jones, the prince of Welch architects, who built the Banquet-
inghouse at Whitehall, and several other edifices?and Davies, the strangely-
gifted calculating Welchman, who has been designated The Leviathan of
the Turf who bets his hundreds and his thousands with England?s betting
Nobility, who, but a few years back had not half-a-crown to bless himself
withall?and Dr. Lee, late professor of Hebrew and Arabic at the univer-
sity of Cambridge?and my very recently deceased acquaintance, the
worthy John Cassell, who walked from Lancashire to London in wooden
shoes ; who in his pursuit of literature lived to receive �l,OOO a year for
the mere loan of his Name?and Dr. John Hunter, one of the greatest
Anatomists that ever lived, whose Education commenced in his 21st year,
had, all of them, toiled at the Carpenters-bench. And among the Sons of
Carpenters, England can boast of a Prior, the ingenious poet and
distinguished statesman?of a Harrison, who received �20,000 from Parlia-
ment as a national acknowledgement of his useful invention of the Time-
keeper, to determine the. Longitude at sea?of the worthy Samuel
Richardson, the friend to poor authors?and of my old acquaintance,
Edmund Kean, ? the volcanic tragedian"?and scorcs of others known to
fame.


� Ray, the most eminent of all England?s naturalists?and Bentley,
who, as a scholar and critic, is known to all the learned world?and Thomas
Cromwell, Earl of Essex?and our highly distinguished living chymist
and natural philosopher, Faraday, were all Sous of Blacksmiths.
Opio (who became President of the Royal Academy) was discovered
by Dr. Wolcott, at the bottom of a Sawpit. Shield, one of England's
favorite musicians, was a Boatbuilder. Brindley, the skilkful engineer,
and active promoter of canal-navigation, was a Millwright. Thomas Guy,
who dedicated more money to charitable purposes than any private indi-
vidual on record, who, after having built and then endowed Guy's
Hospital , left �BO,OOO to his grumbling relations?like Lord Eldon, who,
in our day, sat upon the Woolsack, obstinately retarding the Progress of
the nation , was the Son of a Lighterman. The learned Camden, at once
the pride and boast of British antiquarians, was the Son of a Housepainter.
Three of our famous archbishops, Abbot and Laud and Tillotson, were the
Sons of Clothiers. Sir John Strange, Lord Roden, Lord Kenyon, Lord
Ashburton, Lord Hardwicke, and several others, raised themselves from
being humble Servers of Writs and Engrossers of Deeds, to be clever
Lawyers, learned Judges, and Lord High Chancellors?and, according to
tradition, the Protector of England himself, the great Oliver Cromwell,
was the Son of a Brewer.
Sir John Hawkwood, the military commander?John Speed, author
of the history of Great Britain?Orator Thelwell (my second Teacher in
Elocution) with hundreds more, were ? Knights of the Thimble??while
such exalted men as Lord Howe, and the late archbishop of York, w r ero
Sons of Tailors.
Dr. White, professor of Arabic at Oxford?and the late Dr. Isaac
Milner, Dean of Carlisle, and professor of Mathematics at Cambridge?
and Adam.Walker, the philosophical lecturer?also Alexander Wilson, the
indefatigable Ornithologist, had all been accustomed to Throw the Shuttle
?and among the Sons of poor Weavers, may be reckoned such remarkable
men as the late Dalton, one of England?s greatest scientific children?and
W. J. Fox, politician, lecturer, author, and pulpit-orator.
Of the scores of great men that have risen from the Cobbler?s stall,
I shall mention but two?George Fox, founder of the ? Society of Friends?
(the best educated sect in Christendom) and that ornament to the Wesleyan
connection, Samuel Drew, one of the profoundest of Metaphysicians, who
(as he told me) wrote his elaborate work on the ? Immateriality and Im-
mortality of the Soul,? with a pair of old bellows across his knees, for a
writingdesk.
Sir Richard Arkwright, whose Sous inherited his honest gains (surpass-
ing the wealth of princes) was, untill nearly 80 years of age, a Barber,
in Nottingham, where, according to his own recital, he ? Shaved any dirty-
faced fellow for a Halfpenny.? Wordsworth, the late poet-laureate, was"a
Barber?s boy. And among the Sons of Barbers, must be ranked that
?child of genius? Jeremy* Taylor, bishop of Down, Connor, and


Dromoro?Crnggs tho skilful manager of so many ticklish Embassies?
Jqdge Abbot (afterwards Lord Tenterdon) and several other notable men.
Allen Ramsay, author of tho yet unrivaled ? Gentle Shepherd,? was
Hairdresser. Maitland, who wrote tho much admired histories of
London and Edinburgh, commenced life as a dealer in Horsehair. Owen
Jones, tho Welch antiquary, whoso name will long bo associated with tho
Welch language, was a Furrier. Hobbes, tho philosopher, was a Fell-
monger. Hugh Morris, one of tho first among Welch poets, was a Tanner.
And Miller, the meritorious Lincolnshire poet, was a Baskotmakcr.
Two of our cleverest living lecturers, Gough, on Temperance , and
Faraday, on Chymistry, were both of them Bookbinders?while my
friendly correspondent, professor Nichol, of Glasgow Observatory, was tho
Son of a Bookseller.
Tho chaste writer of ? The Pleasures of tho Imagination,? Dr.
Akensido?and poor Kirk White?and tho indomitable Daniel do Foe?as
also the high and haughty Cardinal Wolsoy, were Sons of Butchers.
Horne Tooke, whoso ? Diversions of Purloy? will bo long road with
avidity by Students of the English language, was tho Son of a Poulterer?
and it is related of him, that when the proud striplings of Eton called
upon him to ? describe" himself, young Tooke made this formal declara-
tion?? lam the Son of an eminent TwrA^-merchaut.?
Sir Thomas Lawrence, the splendid Portraitpaintor, like the popular
and powerful Preacher George Wbiitefield, and the present long-headed,
persecuting Bishop of Exeter, was tho Son of a Publican?Whitoficld and
Philpotts having been born in tho same house, tho Bell Inn, Gloucester.
Sir William Herschell, whoso discoveries in tho heavens astonished the
inhabitants of the earth, was first a Drummer (in tho Band of a Hanoverian
regiment) and hundreds of famous men have risen from the Ranks to bo
Commanding officers. Perhaps tho most remarkable example of advance-
ment. on record, is that of Warren Hastings, who, after carrying the
musket as a common soldier in India, rose to bo its first Governor-
general, ruling over 50 millions of Asiatics. As for me, I covet no such
eminence; for, as Shakespeare says?
They that stand high, have many blasts to shako them ;
And, if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces!?
The famous admiral Benbow ?and Dampier, memorable for his
ponderous folioes of Voyages?like our great navigator, Captain Cooke,
with a long list of clever men, entered the service as common sailors.
That once wretched Cabinboy Falconer, author of the pleasing poem ? The
Shipwreck,? planned, and in a great measure executed his valuable
? Universal Marino Dictionary,? while at Sea ?and the recent poet,
elegant translator, and ?Quarterly Review? critic, Gifford, endured many


hardships ?as a poor kickod-abont Cabiuboy I ' ?Admiral Sir Cloudosley
Shovel was first Sir John Narborough?s Cabiuboy; Sir John having
previously been the Cabiuboy of Sir Christopher Mings ; Sir Christopher
himself having risen from a Cabiuboy.
That eminent chymist and philosopher Sir Humphrey Davy, was the
Son of a Carver in \\ ood?the far-famed Hogarth, as also Boydell, the
largest Priutseller in Europe, who filled the high and honorable office of
Lord Mayor of Loudon?like Thomas Hood, celebrated for his Sheets of
Comicalities and less perishable productions (such as his Song of the Shirt)
were Engravers.
Dr. Hawkesworth, writer of ?The Adventurer??the worldwide
known James Watt, of Steamcngino notoriety?and the over-wrought Sir
Samuel llomilly, the perseveringly active philanthropist, eminent states-
man, and able Solicitor-general, were Watchmakers Sons.
Cowley, one of our great poets, though now but little read?and
Howard the notable philanthropist, who literally ? went about doing good,?
whose name is held in honored rememberance both at home and abroad
like the melodious Thomas Moore?and Lord Chancellor King, were the
Sons of Grocers.
, . Collins, the poet, was a Hatter?s Son?Ballard, author of ? Memoirs of
British Ladies,? was a Staymaker?Hally, one of the first philosophers of
his time, and a prodigy of mathematical and astronomical science, was the
Son of a Soapboiler?Cunningham, one of our best pastoral poets, was the
Son of a Winecoopor Dr. Arno, the most popular composer of his day,
known to all the musical world, was the Son of an Upholsterer.
Dr. Isaac Barrow, a master-spirit?the too much neglected moral
poet, Alexander Pope?and the too little known John Byrom, of Shorthand
celebrity?like Archbishop Potter, were the Sons of Linnendrapcrs.
Caxton, who introduced that modern marvel the Printing-press into
England?like Gay, the poet, served his time to a Mercer?and Simon
Patrick, bishop of Ely, was a Mercer?s Son. That illustrious lawyer and
judge, Sir William Blackstone, whose Commentaries on the Laws of
England have secured him a lasting reputation, was the Son of a Silkman.
Lord Clive was a Merchant?s clerk?Kennicott, the famous biblical
critic, and that prodigy of learning Person, were Sons of Parish-clerks
while the overwhelming Lord Chancellor Thurlow, boasted of his descent
from a common Carrier.
The memorable Isaac Walton, like hundreds of celebrated men, was a
Shopkeeper?while Butler (Lord bishop of Durham) whose ?Analogy
of Religion has rendered his name familiar to all sects of Christians, was,
like thousands of literary and scientific men, a Shopkeeper's Son.


I could not, if I would, enumerate a tithe of the extraordinary men
that have, like Dr. Franklin, emerged out of ? Priuters-devils? ?for, their
name is Legion.
Franklin, as all the world knows, was a self-taught man ; and, strange
as some of my readers may think the assertion, I would tell them, that
very few are taught to any great and good purpose, who are not, like
Hooker and Baxter, self-taught. I cannot however pause to substantiate
my assertion by 100 examples. Hobbes the philosopher (author of
the Leviathan) was wholely self-educated ; and when asked, How ho had
attained such a depth of penetration into men and things, He attributed
his skill to having read little and thought much ; and ho was often heard
to say, Had I read as much as other men around mo, I should have been
as stupid and ignorant as they are.? Such was Robert Mudie, the recent
writer and compiler of about 90 volumes?such was Thomas Simpson, who
though famous as a mathematician, was driven by adverse circumstances
to be a Fortune-teller, a Conjurer, a Weaver, by day, and a Schoolmaster
by night?such was William Edwards of Glamorganshire,the wonderful
Bridgebuilder??such was Lows Morris, of the Isle of Anglesea, poet,
antiquary, and government surveyor?such was Goronwy Owen, ? the prince
of Welch poets,? whoso parents were too poor to afford him any instruc-
tion, but whoso natural abilities and persevering industry overcame all
obstacles?such was the recent Richard Lloyd, commonly known in Wales
as The Bard of Snowden, who writes, in one of his notes to Oayton
Wahe ?I received an education of 9 months, and I acknowledge this
blessing with humble gratitude, as it has been to mo an inestimable source
of happiness?Such was Ebenezer Elliott, ?the Corn-law rhimer.?
Our much admired biblical critic, Dr, Kitto, was deaf from a very
early ago, was indebted to the Poor-rates for his subsistence, and dated his
first Essays from ? The Workhouse.?
Dr. Nicholas Saunderson, and the Rev. Dr. Thomas Blacklock, with
several other men of extensive erudition, were blind. Even one of the
most renowned of England?s roadmakers, John Metcalf (who boasted of
his 4 Children, 20 Grandchildren, and 90 Great-grandchildren! was
much better known as ? Blind Jack of Knaresborough,? and died (1810)
both honored and lamented.
Milton, our second-greatest poet, one of the most independent-minded
ornaments of England, whose works are now, at length, so generally read
as to require fresh editions every year?like Gray, the poet, who was
accounted the most learned man in Europe, was a Scrivener?s Son.
The elegant poet Daniel Samwell, of Denbighshire, to whom we are
indebted for the circumstantial account of Captain Cooke?s death, was
Surgeon on board The Discovery, and an eye-witness of the humane
Commander?s end?while Dr Thomas Coke, the indefatigable Wesleyan
Missionary, who, after several years spent in North America, made 9
voyages from England to the West Indies (to whose exciting recitals of


peril# and successes I used to listen with breathless interest, at our Family
fireside) and who died on his voyage to the East Indies (1811) was the
Son of a Surgeon at Breckon.
The celebrated Lord Chief Justice Denman, but recently deceased,
sprang from an humble Man-midwife and England?s greatest living
Benefactor??the Defender of Liberty ?the Advocate of Peace,"
?the Friend of the People,"* Brougham, whoso name will bo had in
honored and grateful romembcranco ages after all his dopreciaters shall
have sunk into utter oblivion, is the descendant of a lowly trader in
Deal-boards.
? Honor and Shamo from no condition rise;
Act well your part ?there, all the honor lies!?
But, I must cease instancing men of renown who ? Sprang from
Nothing, or, I shall weary the patience of my most patient Readers ; for,
scores and hundreds of the so-called inferior individuals, have, during the
last and present century, raised themselves from obscurity to celebrity,
from the lower-classes to the higher-ranks of Society, from plodding
Artisans to honored Legislators. A list of even our still" living great men,
would occupy several pages.
The Rev. Dr. David Livingston, whose name is closely connected
with the Missionary cause in Africa, whose past and present enterprises are
known throughout the civilized world, formerly wrought at Blantyro-mill,
Scotland, as a Piece-boy ; and afterwards, while the winter months were
devoted to Study (at Glasgow College) he continued his manual labor during
the summer months. The Rev. Dr. John Campbell, whose sledge-hammer
anathemas may still be heard in his Tottenham Court Road Chapel, was a
Blacksmith. Sir William Cubit (Knighted for his share in the construction
of the Great Exhibition of 1851) first worked at his father?s flour-mill,
before ho became a Millwright. Sir Joseph Paxton, Architect of the
Great Exhibition Building of 1851, was Gardener to the Duke of Devon-
shire ; and his labors at Chatsworth arc famed throughout England. Sir
Samuel Moreton Peto, Bart, the constructor of several of the greatest
engineering works of the present century, and one of our most notable
philanthropists (at present in temporary embarrassment, from the sudden
effects of the now subsiding Panic) worked, 7 years, as a Carpenter, Brick-
layer, and Mason. Thomas Wright, ? the Manchester Prison Philan-
thropist, ivas 47 years a weekly servant in Ormerod and Son?s Iron-
foundery. The Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord Chief Baron of the
Court of Exchequer, is the Son of Pollock the Saddler, at Charing-cross.
Lough, the self-taught Sculptor, followed the Plow on his father's little
farm. William Schaw Lindsay (left an Orphan at 6 years of age) cpm-
menced his career, when only 15, with but Bs. 6d. in his pocket, to push
his fortunes as a C abinboy; and, in 1845, he settled in London, where
he laid the foundation of that extensive business which entitles him to be
enrolled among ?the merchant princes of the metropolis.? Clarkson
?It is the expressed wish of Lord Brougham, that these 3 sentences should
constitute his Epitaph?or, at least, be engraved on his Tombstone.


Stanfield, one of oar favorite Painters (in whoso Studio I have admired his
progressive art on the easel) commenced life as a Sailor?the secret of his
excelling in Marine subjects. That strange compound Thomas Carlyle, of
whom ? all the world? speaks so highly (those who do, and those who do
not, apprehend him) and who must, despite his eccentricities, bo ranked
among the most original thinkers of this age, is the Son of a petty Farmer.
That long-tried friend and benefactor of the People, William Chambers,
worked both at the Case and at the Press, in his own little Printing-office.
Gerald Massey, who still continues issuing his pleasing Poems, is the Son
of a Canal-boatman, who drudged for years at 10s. a-week ; and when but
8 years of age, poor Gerald had to labor in the Factory, rising at 5 and
toiling till half-past G in the evening, returning through cold and rain,
snow and storm, on Saturday nights, with 9d. or Is. or Is. Bd. for his
whole week?s work. The Hon. Owen Bromley (now a Member of the
American Senate) who is at. present Lecturing in the Principality of Wales,
?on Temperance and the magnitude of the Drink-traffic in the United
Kingdom,? was formerly a Welch Miner. Charles Gilpin (whoso un-
wearied kindness to me, I cannot refrain from mentioning, with unfeigned
gratitude) till recently Secretary to the Poor-law Board, Member of the late
Cabinet, and indefatigable in his exertions to get rid of that Mosaic
monstrosity Capital Punishment, was Tor several years ? on the Road,?
carrying his Samples in his saddle-bags (on horseback) behind him.
But instead of ceasing, I am continuing with examples of those who
have elevated themselves above their original positions in life ; for, though
Potentates may make men great , Great men make themselves. I become
impatient, when I hear the Machinist and Mechanic, who are the chief-
organs of human outward greatness, spoken of by the high-bom and
haughty, as being ?only of the inferior classes;? while they look upon
the titled gentry, who are wrapped up in the chrysalis of pomp (like
insects in the pupa state) as belonging to a superior class: what an
insult to Commonsense?as if Arkwright and Crompton and Watt, as if
Taylor and Fulton and Gray and Stephenson, had not done more for
Humanity, than all the pampered Aristocrats that ever lived, that ever
breathed ! It is that very so-called infei'ior class, despised as it may bo
by the proud Do-nothings, that has made England the greatest nation
upon earth, though its inhabitants do not exceed 80 millions. And as to
intellectuality, mind, genius, the hasely-hom and inferior class has
elevated itself far, immeasurably far above the high-born and superior
class; for, such men as the myriad-minded Shakespeare, once the
Prompter?s Call-boy ?the Tinker Bunyan, greatest of Allegorists since the
transcendent writer of the First chapter of Genesis?the courageous
De Foe, a poor Butcher's Son ?Johnson, ?the Hercules of the English
language??Watt, writer of the stupendous Bibliotheca Britannica, though
brought up at the Plow's tail ?and the present Lord St. Leonards
(Barrister Sugden) a legal oracle, a royal adviser, and High Chancellor of
Ireland, notwithstanding he was once a Barber, and the Son of a Barber
?these and many more such lom-bom men, have no parallels among the
superior class as to genius, mind, and intellectuality.
? The Bank is but the guinea's stamp,
The Mail?s the gowd for a* that!?


Managers of Penny Headings shonld tell their auditories, should
tell them over and over, and carefully over again, of the rise of hundreds
of such men as I have rapidly instanced; should toll them more at
length, of the emergence of such men out of poverty and obscurity into
affluence and celebrity ; should hold them up as examples of industry and
perseverance, and stimulate their unlettered hearers to laudable emulation,
assuring them of certain reward; assuring them that a steady, vigorous,
and unwearied exertion of the faculties, is invariably crowned with
success; for, as Dr. Arnold expresses it?
If there bo one thing on earth which is trucly admirable, it is to soo
God?s wisdom blessing an inferiority of natural powers, when they have
been honestly, truely, zealously cultivated.?
Managers of Penny Headings should give, on even/ evening . a short
biographical account of some One who has raised himself from littleness
to greatness?such account not occupying more than 5 or 10 minutes,
never exceeding 15?for, the influence of Example is beyond all calcu-
lation. Many an uncultivated mind, requires but a striking example to
rouse it out of lethargy, and sot it a-thinking ?a single fillip to the
intellect, has, more than once, arpused a sleeping genius?
? Full many a Ocm, of purest ray, serene
The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear ;
Full many a Flower is bom to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.?
Nothing can be better adapted to attract the attention and rouse the
energies of such mixed auditories, than a pithy recital of the origin and
progress of such men (for instance) as George Stephenson, the Locomotive
Improver, who died at his Scat, Tapton (1848) thojfamiliar of England s
Aristocracy ; who dined with Nobles and Princes, Kings and Queens, after
having raised himself from a Trapper in a Coalpit; who first learned to
Read when 22 years of age, paying 4d. a-wcck out of his scanty earnings,
to his humble Instructor. Honor to whom honor is Duo !
10 minutes might bo profitably devoted to such a man as Budgott,
the founder of that immense establishment, at Bristol, which I traveled
upwards of 200 miles to inspect. Ho purchased a Donky for Half-a-
crown, and sold it to a Laundress for Five Shillings, who paid him with a
Pair of Stays, which he realized for Ten Shillings and Sixpence?it was
thus, that the now so-styled Successful Merchant laid the foundation of
the accumulating fortunes of the House of Budgctt, fy Co.
10 minutes might bo advantageously occupied in descanting on such
model-men as Alderman Waithman, born of humble parents, near Wrex-
ham, in North Wales, recently as well known in London as St. Paul?s ;
one who was, emphatically, ? the architect of his own fortune??from
whose lips I have heard many interesting and instructive passages of his
life?who, though He rose to be elected into the Common Council of the
City of London, then M.P. then Alderman, then Sheriff, and then Lord
Mayor, he never neglected his duties as a Linnendraper ; in which capacity


I have soon him, scores of times, behind the counter, at the comer of
Fleet St. and Bridge St. helping customers, indiscriminately?an ornament
to his Shop, and possessed of too much Commonsenso to bo ashamed of
his Business ; knowing that it is not the Calling that dignifies the Man,
but, the Man that dignities the Calling, bo it what it may. Ho was not
ashamed to take a small Parcel in his hand, and leave it at a Customer?s
house, on his way to Guild-Hall, where ho probably had to take the Chair
at some important Meeting affecting the interests of all the inhabitants of
the Metropolis. "When men ore above their Business, it is high time for
them to quit business altogether.
5 or 10 minutes might bo given to the encouraging of those who
are past the heyday of life, by instancing notable examples of success at
advanced periods?such as Ogilby, the dancing master, who commenced
his studies in Latin when considerably above 40 years of age, and some
years afterwards published his Translations of Virgil?in his 54th year, ho
began to learn Greek, that ho might match his version of the Eneid by
versions of the Iliad and Odyssey; both of which ho lived to publish ; and
at the ago of 70, ho closed a life remarkable for its vicissitudes, highly in-
structive as an evidence of the respectable proficiency in Literature which
may ho acquired ?by those who first begin late in life, and also of what may
bo effected by a resolute mind in repairing the worst ills of fortune? Lack
of Education.
The Canterbury Talcs were begun in Chaucer?s 54th, and ended in
his Gist year. At 70 Johnson undertook to write the ? Lives of the
English Poets??the most popular of all his compositions. Cowpcr, after
ho had received a regular and classical education, idled away 20 or 30
of the prime year's of his life in doing ?Nothing ! Ho was upwards of 50
when his first volume of Poems appeared ; and it was still later in life
that ho wrote his most celebrated pieces; and yet, Cowpor occupies no
contemptible page in the history of English literature.
An occasional 6 or 10 minutes might bo given to those, who have
raised themselves despite the long-continued thwartiugs of perverse and
obstinate Poverty?also to those in the pursuit of Knowledge under extra-
ordinary difficulties ?and to those who have had uncommon obstructions
in the Communication of their acquisitions.
Sir Walter Raleigh?s unfinished ? History of the World,? so eulogized
by Hume and others, from which so many historians have extracted
copiously, without even an acknowledgement, was the fruit of 11 years of
Incarceration?by order of his ungrateful Queen, the bepraised ?Glorious
Queen Bess.?
? The Pilgrim?s Progress,? one of the most interesting travels ever
communicated to his countrymen, or mankind, was performed within the
narrow circuit of Bunyan?s prison walls.
? Fleta,? a work well known and highly esteemed among gentlemen
of the Law?, was written by a Debtor in the Fleet-prison, whose name
remains unknown.


Howell wrote the most of his ?Familiar Letters,? and nearly all his
other entertaining works, to procure subsistence while shut up in the Fleet.
It was in the King?s Bench, when a prisoner for debt, that Lydiat
composed his so much admired ? Annotations on the Parian Chronicle,?
first published by Prideaux.
Sir William Davenent finished his once highly esteemed poem,
? Gondibert,? while confined, by the Rebels, in Carisbrook Castle.
George Wither dedicated his ? Shepherd?s Hunting? to his friends?
? My Visitants in the Marshalsea.?
The ?Prison Thoughts? of Dr. Dodd, who was hanged in conformity
with the barbarous Mosaic laws of his day, may still bo found on every
bookstall.
That truely great man, Daniel do Foe, began his memorable ? Review?
(a periodical which extended to 9 thick quarto volumes) within the walls of
Newgate, where he was incarcerated on account of a political pamphlet,
published before England was blessed with that great national blessing,
the Freedom of the Press. It is worthy of remark, that England, and
Europe, and the World, is indebted to that very ? Review? (set on foot
in Newgate prison) for the numerous volumes of Spectators, Tatlers,
Guardians, Ramblers, etc. which now constitute such an important part
of what is commonly designated Polite Literature.
Thomas Cooper, one of our living poets of the People (who, as a
Chartist, was tried at Stafford, in 1842, and after a vigorous Self-
defense committed) Penned his great poem ? The Purgatory of Suicides?
(1845) during that very imprisonment?Such was our boasted English
Liberty but a quarter of a century back! and, in 18G6, the Spirit of
Persecution still exists.
From long observation, I can assure my Readers, that ? the Unculti-
vated? often possess higher views and more towering imaginations, than
many who have received a college or a university education; and many a
one who seems doomed to the drudgeries of life, has a more capacious
mind and a more delicate taste, than the man under whom he toils for his
daily bread. Wisdom speaks to her children as distinctly and forcibly
in English, as ever she spoke in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew. Therefore, in
Penny Readings make choice of the Gems, not the Rubbish, of litera-
ture ; giving the Laboring-classes an intellectual feast?which they can
relish as well as most of their employers ; You cannot give them anything
too good; the better it is, the better they will like it, and the better will
the Readings be attended by the more orderly and thinking among them.
The writings of my old acquaintance Douglas Jerrold, stand as a
signal proof, that the largest numbers of Readers are not to be propitiated
by what has foolishly and falsely been considered as essential to popularity,
namely, that of writing down to an imaginary low intellectual standard:


give the populace the best sense, clothed in the best language, and rely on
its just appreciation. Jerrold was trained into Good-writing, by observa-
tion and experience. His education as a child was within the verge of a
theatre; bis education as a hoy, was on the deck of a man-of-war; bis edu-
cation as a youth , was in a printing-office ; and bis education as a man
was in the wide world. Ho has written scores of fitting Pieces, capital
Pieces for Penny Readings , calculated to tickle the fancy and improve the
understanding?yet, one of the Pubbc readers, but a few evenings ago,
exposed bis lamentable lack of taste and deplorable judgement, by giving
to ?gaping listeners? ?Caudle is made a Mason! Can it be, that the
Caudle-reader never board of Jorrold?s ? Shilling Magazine ?? a publica-
tion ? devoted to a consideration of the social wants and rightful claims
of the People?? a long-continued ? Appeal to the hearts of the Masses of
England.?
But, a still more censurable selection was made by one who advertizes
himself as a Professor of Elocution , and (as I was told) looks upon Him-
self as being the first in the first rank of Elocutionists in Australia! Tho
choice of the Piece, was a proof of bis bad taste ; the clever execution of
tho Tomfoolery be appended to it, was a proof of his low conception of
the dignity of bis Profession. It was announced on the Program as a
Reading, but, it was virtually a Recitation ; and the so-called Professor
bad bestowed considerable pains in ?getting-up? the worse than good-for-
nothing Piece, entitled ?? Sam Weller?s Valentine,? from tho prolific pen
of the talented Dickens. When it was announced to the assembly, that
the Professor would give a Reading, the Schoolroom rang with plaudits,
shook from stamping, and echoed with shrill whistlings, in anticipation of
the raptures about to bo enjoyed- s ?those disgracefully uproarious out-
pourings of bodily strength, evidently ran like oil down the backbone of tho
delighted and self-satisfied Professor, who rose from bis chair (largo ns life)
and, and after turning condescendingly to tho right and complaisantly to
the left, after assuming all tho consequentialucss of a Bantam-cock on his
own midden, after scientifically ransacking tho pockets of his great-coat,
which he had most skilfully cast over tho accommodating back of an adja-
cent chair, after having dexterously extracted a very carefully stowed-away
Goose-feather-Pen, and exhibited it to the auditory, as if it had been a
magic-wand, holding it up to the light to examine tho nib, and writing a
foolish comment with his face (to the unspeakable amusement of a lot of
noisy urchins) He then set to work in good earnest, to edify Iso, no, not
to edify, but to tickle the risible propensities of ? the Groundlings, who,
for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and
noise I? It was, emphatically, tho most shameful and shameless attempt
at Elocution I ever witnessed; it was reproachful grimace and downright
buffoonery; as unworthy of the Man as discreditable to the Professor ?
quite eclipsing another great man?s endeavour to immortalize himself on
the same Platform, by mumbling out ? Mrs. Snagsby?s Tea Party.?
"What, in the name of Commonsense, can the intelligent unlettered
Masses collect from such trash, to elevate them socially, morally, intellectu-
ally, or religiously ? Such Pieces are intentionally written in bad English,
replete with coarse and vulgar expressions, communicating low and de-
grading notions, and familiarizing both to the ears and the understandings


of tho uneducated, vulgarity of utterance and lowness of sentiment
abominations of which no real Friend of the People ever was, or ever
can bo guilty.
Such mismanaged and disorderly Penny Readings may, perhaps,
afford sickly amusement for a few evenings ; but they will quickly come to
a close : for, they are destitute of tho seeds of mental improvement; and
when crowds are crying for bread, it is as vain as it is cruel, to give them
either chaff' or stones to eat. Even tho least educated individual
attending Penny Readings , possesses a mind capable of engendering
thoughts which shall range throughout tho vastness of eternity ; capable
of becoming familiar with conceptions of tho sublimest virtues and
noblest principles : tho beggar as well as tho prince, tho peasant ns well as
the noble, tho slave as well as tho conqueror, possesses a mind worth
infinitely more than this material universe?or, Christianity is little better
than a cunningly devised fable, and Religion itself a more rhapsody.
Tell mo not of tho good-intentions of Managers and Readers; I
cannot give car to such exculpations, to such unqualified nonsense : all tho
Penny Readings I have hitherto attended in Melbourne, have been sheer
Insults to the Laboring-classes ; many of whom, if invited, would have
surpassed, both in judgement as to selection, and in skill as to delivery,
several of tho Usurpers of tho Platform.
16 August. I had written thus far, when today?s Argus was handed
in, with the exclamation?There?s a Leader for you, on Penny Readings,
tho very subject you have announced as being ?in tho Press;? perhaps
you may pick up a hint or two.?
I infer from tho Article, that the writer has not been a frequenter of
the Penny Readings about Melbourne; as tho hundred-eyed and
discriminating writers of Leaders for The Argus, would have been sure to
have embraced tho opportunity of administering a few stripes of Chastise-
ment, as well as a little Advice: and, for tho public good, I wish The
Argus would visit a few of the so-called Readings, and then favor us with
another Leader upon them. Tho influence of The Argus is great; and
deservedly so : let it not lessen that influence by penning Leaders on
subjects with which it is not thoroughly acquainted?with all its eyes, it
has not yet discerned what Penny Readings now are, nor what they ought
to be, and what they easily might be.
I make no hesitation in publicly .declaring, that I am perfectly
disgusted at the nothingness of the Pieces which have generally been read
or recited at all the Penny Readings I have hitherto attended! at tho
consummate assurance of tho unqualified Readers who have presented
themselves on tho Platforms, to mince, mumble, and murder, whatever
they took in hand?whether the unsuitable selections from Dickens,
Tennyson, & Co. or, the chance lucky selections from Hood, Scott,
Shakespeare, &c. What is it to me, that tho Reader happens to be a
Town Councillor, or a Member of Parliament, or a Man of �I,OOO a-day, if
I cannot hear him distinctly and apprehend him clearly? or, what is it to
me that the Reader is a Schoolmaster, a private Teacher, or a professor of


Elocution, if ho has not learned so to speak that ho can bo heard
and understood 9 Neither an injudiciously subdued, nor a vociferous
utterance, has any charm for mo ; both of thorn are as censurable as
they are unintelligible.
? Some placid Readers fill the allotted scene
With lifeless drone, insipid and serene ;
While others, thunder every couplet o?er,
And almost crack your cars with rant and roar!
What though a Reader spread out his well-practiced fingers over the
book (like a monstcrous Tarantula) or, throw himself into laboriously
studied attitudes (reminding you of a live Lobster when dropped into a
boiler of scalding water) still, if what ho utters bo unintelligible?, he is
unquestionably a bad reader, whatever ho may bo besides.
? The Word and Action should conjointly suit,
But acting words is labor too minute.
That Voice all inodes of passion can express,
Which marks the proper word with proper stress.?
My advice to Managers of Penny Headings, is simply this?lf you
have hitherto had no higher aim, than merely amusing the crowds of
uneducated Hearers (killing a few hours of time) learn at once to set a
higher value on their precious moments, and entertain a higher sense of
the importance and dignity of rational, social, and accountable Beings.
Let them by all means bo amused ; afford them plenty of entertainment;
give them occasional mirth and merriment, hilarity and laughter : but, bo
sure to give them something better', something that may do them good
and not evil all the days of their lives. In a sermon (for I sometimes read
sermons, as well as other dry things) entitled ? The advantages of
Knowledge to the Lower-classes,? delivered by that groat and good man
Robert Hall, and which ho published in 1810, I met with the following
paragraph, which, 50 years ago, I thought worth copying, and which I
shall copy again now?
Wo congratulate the Nation on the extent of the efforts employed, and
the means set on foot, for the Improvement of the Lower classes; and
especially the children of the poor, in moral and religious knowledge, from
which we hope much good will accrue, not only to the parties concerned,
but, to the Kingdom at largo. These are the likeliest, or rather, the only
expedients that can bo adopted for forming a sound ar\d virtuous popu-
lace ; and, if there bo any truth in the figure by which society is compared
to a pyramid, it is on them its stability chiefly depends: the elaborate
ornament at the top, will be a wretched compensation for the want of
solidity in the lower parts of the structure.?
And the gigantic-minded Dr. Chalmers writes?
I have no sympathy whatever, with those who would grudge our
Workmen the very highest acquisitions which their taste, or their time, or
their inclinations, would lead them to realize; for, next to the salvation
of their souls, I certainly say, that the Object of my fondest aspirations,
is, the moral and intellectxud ?and, as a sure consequence of this, the


economical advancement of tho Working-classes?the One object, which,
of all others in the wide range of political speculation, is tho one which
should be tho dearest to tho heart of ovory philanthropist and every true
patriot.?
And a still greater than Hall, a still greater than Chalmers, said (in
his Inaugural discourse as Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow) on
6 April 1825
To diffuse useful information?to further intellectual refinement, sure
forerunner of moral improvement ?to hasten tho coming of that bright
day, when the dawn of general knowledge shall chase away tho lazy,
lingering mists, even from the base of the great social pyramid ?this
indeed is a high Calling, in which tho most splendid talents and consum-
mate virtue may well press onward, eager to bear a part. I know that I
speak in a place consecrated by the pious wisdom of ancient times, to tho
Instruction of but a select portion of tho community. Yet, from this
classic ground have gone forth those whoso Genius, not their Ancestry,
ennobled them; whoso incredible merits have opened to all ranks the
temple of science ; whoso illustrious example has made tho humblest,
emulous to climb steeps no longer inaccessible, and enter tho unfolded
gates, burning in the sun. I speak in that city where Black having once
taught, and Watt learned, tho grand experiment was afterwards made in
our day, and with intiro success, to demonstrate, that the highest intel-
lectual cultivation is perfectly compatible with the daily cares and toils of
Working-men ; to show by thousands of living examples, that a keen
relish for tho most sublime truths of science belongs alike to every class
of mankind.?
Perish then, tho Tomfooleries of mere fun-making Readers, and all
tho Buffooneries of mimicking Professors, who have not the remotest con-
ceptions of tho capabilities and rights of tho Laboring-classes, so clearly
understood and ably advocated by Hall, Chalmers, and Brougham!
If, instead of the childish, insignificant, pithless, Pieces (such as I
have heard at tho Penny Readings) Pieces containing useful knowledge,
inculcating lessons of wisdom, and conveying sentiments to elevate and
ennoble and civilize tho minds of tho uncultivated assemblies, were
effectively Read, night after night; the change in the moral as well as
intellectual character of tho Attendants, would speedily become visible to
the whole neighbourhood ; for, as Dr. Channing has remarked (in his
Address on Temperance)
A work of genius, recited by a man of fine taste, enthusiasm, and
powers of Elocution, is a very pure and high gratification. Were this art
cultivated and encouraged, great numbers, now insensible to tho most
beautiful compositions, might be waked-up to their excelence and power.
It is not easy to conceive a more effectual may of spreading a refined
taste through a Community. The Drama, undoubtedly, appeals more
strongly to the passions, than Recitation ; but, tho latter brings out the
meaning of the author more. Shakespeare, worthily recited, would be
better understood than on the Stage. Then, in Recitation, we escape the
weariness of listening to poor performers, who, after all, fill up most of the


time nt (he theatre. Recitation, sufficiently varied, so as to include Pieces
of chaste wit, of pathos, beauty, and sublimity, is adapted to our present
intellectual prepress, as much as the Drama falls below it. Should this
exhibition be introduced among us successfully, the result would be. that
?nn I law.r T) * .'i .i ' ..111 i ? _
the Powers of Recitation would bo extensively called forth, and this would

be added to our social and domestic pleasures."

Progress of Life?Seven Ages Shakespeare
Had Mr. Noone called, he would have received the preceding List of
Single Pieces; to which I could quickly have annexed 100 Dialogues,
Trialogues, and Colloquies, suited to Penny Readings. Such specimens
of our Literature need not the appendages of Song, much less the
grimaces and tomfooleries of Readers ; for, they contain sufficient sterling
matter to afford rational entertainment to any intelligent and intellectual
auditory.
Occasionally, those who have acquired a taste for Literature may be indulged
with a variety of Specimens on the same subject, as given by different writers; for
instance, a Reader might give a Description of Morning by Surrey, Shakespeare,
Fletcher, Cowley, Milton, and Coleridge ; or, a
Description of Night by Sackville, Shakespeare, Drayton, Dryden, Young, and
Byron; or, a
Description of Summer by Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Burns, Joanna Baillie,
and Scott j or, a
Description of Autumn by Shakespeare, Burns, Keats, Shelley, Coleridge, and
Southey ; or, a
Description of Winter by Sackville, Greene, Thomson, Burns, Shelley, and Camp-
bell ; or, a
Description of Christmas by Shakespeare, Herrick, Wither, Cowper, Coleridge,
and Heber; or, a
Description of Flowers by Chaucer, Shakespeare, Raleigh, Herrick, Burns, and
Campbell; or, a
Description of Birds by Drayton, Drummond, Logan, Coleridge, Wordsworth,
and Shelley ; or, a
Description of Man by Shakespeare, Barrow, Pope, Young, Parr, and Shepherd t


or, a Description of aught olso, by some half-dozen of authors : as such
comparisons and contrasts of different writers on the same topics,
invariably afford gratification ; and, upon an average, G such specimens
would not occupy more than 12 minutes?while such Gems would be sure
to be pretty well appreciated by the Masses.
Besides, Pieces containing food for the mind, would bo listened to
with attention; and the uproarious applauses and the thundering noises of
unruly urchins, would soon bo put down by the auditors themselves, who
would not endure tho unseemly and disgraceful clappings and stampings
and whistlings, which I have heard at every Penny Heading I have
attended, liaise but tho character of tho Readings, and order will soon
be established.
Some of the poorest and least effective Readers, select Pieces as long
as their arms, and cannot bo persuaded to read a short Piece; not aware,
that ? Variety is the very spice of Life,? and that 20 or 80 Pieces have
a 1,000 times better effect, on a mixed assembly, than 6 or 10, in a couple
of hours. Wo have hundreds of beautiful specimens of literature, which
do not occupy more that 5, 4, 8, or 2 minutes in tho delivery ; and the
best Readers treat us to tho greatest number of short Pieces: 15 minutes
is a very long time; and if given by a mere ordinary Reader, cannot but
prove wearisome ; much bettor for tho same Reader to give half-a-dozen
short Pieces on one evening, than a single piece extending over a quarter
of an hour?besides, if ill-read, a short Piece may be patiently endured ;
while a long one is a downright bore. To keep up attention for two hours
together, there ought not to bo fewer than from 10 to 20 different Readers
and they may easily be obtained after tho first evening or two?tho
Uneducated out-numbering those who read merely for example?s sake.
One observation more, relating to the choice of Pieces, and I shall
have done. Some Readers have a strange, a diseased taste for Specimens
of cruelty, shocking events, horrible stories; and seem to delight them-
selves in harrowing the feelings of their auditors : but, people do not go to
Penny Readings to have their hairs set up on end, like quills upon tho
fretful porcupine ; neither to have their sleep disturbed by fearful dreams
and frightful apparitions. There are many ably penned and very telling
accounts, both in prose and verse, which, if well read, are intensely
interesting and painfully exciting?Let no such discomforting, doleful,
saddening Pieces bo read or recited at Penny Readings, where they are
invariably out-of-placo. Long as I have had tho management of Public
Readings, I never would allow Eugene Aram's Bream (by Hood) much
less The Maniac (by Lewis) to bo given by anyone; yet, I have heard
both these unsuitable, insufferable Pieces, over and over again in Melbourne f
They ought not to be tolerated by the Public ; for, the better they are
delivered, the worse is their effect: persons of refinement would be
ashamed to road them ; persons of delicate feelings could not bo hired to
read them ; and they certainly ought to be banished from Penny Platforms
altogether.
To conclude?l was not aware that I had penned so many pages,
uutill the Printer sent in the Proof-sheets; and though there may be too


much in quantity, I have not time now to make it loss. Perhaps, I may
have given too many Examples of men who have raised themselves from
littleness to greatness ; but, they rushed upon my memory, and I put them
down without reflecting upon the space I was occupying. In other States,
a man?s right and eligibility to Public-office, are frequently dependent on
his birth and family; in some Countries, not only his individual eligibility
must bo clear and indisputable, but, it must also bo very satisfactorily
known, who and what and whence his progenitors were. While on the
Continent of Europe, I heard many express astonishment at Sir Robert
Peel's being Prime Minister of England?a man whoso Grandfather was
known to have worked in Clogs, for 12s. a-week 1 Such an outrage on
etiquette, was monsterous in their eyes; and they certainly would have
thought less highly of Canning, the First Lord of the Treasury, had I told
them that his Mother was an Actress. In 1851, it was with difficulty that
I succeeded in convincing a company of Foreigners who were on a visit to
the Great Exhibition, that the then Lord Mayor of London was an
Auctioneer, and my old acquaintance, James Luke, the Lord Mayor of
York, a Currier, whom I-had often seen stripped at work, as apprentice
to my father?s intimate and exalted friend, Joseph Agar, who entered York,
in search of employment, with only Sixpence in his pocket. An English-
man?s avocations in life, do not prevent his obtaining station, office, power ;
if he have but abilities, ho may boldly aspire to anything short of the
Crown : no one thinks of asking what Trade ho is, or, what his Father or
Grandfather was before him; an Englishman is his own Architect, his
own Patron, his otvn Maker. In Great Britain, more than in any other
country, Man is estimated on his own merits; hence the scores and
hundreds of low-horn and poverty-struck individuals who have elevated
themselves to affluence and honor and power, even to Bishops and Arch-
bishops, to Judges and Lord High Chancellors.
? Honors best thrive
When rather from our acts we them derive,
Than our fore-goers. All's Well, etc.
To render Penny Peadinys useful as well as amusing, to render
them blessings wherever they may bo established, the observance of two
things is principally requisite?the securing of a number of the Laboring-
classes as Readers ; and the judicious selection of such Pieces as may en-
lighten and elevate the Hearers, at the same time that they please and
entertain them. The better informed Classes should encourage and
stimulate their less-informed neighbours to take an active part in the
Readings, and cull suitable Pieces from the inexhaustible treasures of our
literature, for their delivery.
I am not insensible to the many useful, and even excelent passages
to be met with in the writings of the talented Dickens ; but, lam provoked
and disgusted with the Selections commonly made : and as for Tennyson,
the present pet poet, I never yet met with a Piece from his pen, that I
would condescend to read in public; nor have I any expectation of ever
meeting with such a Piece. Let any Reader of taste, anyone possessed of
ordinary, or even extraordinary discernment, point out, if he can, a single


particle of thought, a single grand idea, a single poetical or merely
beautiful expression, in that trumpery ?Ode to Christmas,? which
recently went the round of the Newspapers, and was bepraised to the
third heavens. Yet, these two writers are now in fashion ?the two
pro-eminent favorites among the Readers at Penny Readings : witness
the Programs. I attribute this lack of taste and defect in judgement
solely to the paucity of knowledge among the Readers themselves ; and I
may say to them, as Nathaniel said to Holoferues (when speaking of Dull)
? Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a Book; he hath
not eat Paper, as it were; he hath not drunk Ink; his intellect is not
replenishedfor, an acquaintance with the hundreds of our clever
Writers, and the - thousands of suitable Pieces, would reduce the two
temporarily exalted Melbourne favorites, to their proper level.
Perhaps, some of my remarks may bo displeasing to some of my
Readers; truth being one of the most disagreeable things imaginable,
when it runs counter to self-gratification : for, as Montagu expresses it?
Truth will ever be unpalatable to those who are determined not to relinquish
Error ; but, can never give offense to the honest and well-meaning.?
To which I would add, in the phraseology of Jerome ?
If an offense come out of the Truth, better is it that the offense come, than
that the Truth bo concealed.?
Penny Readings may be made Public Blessings ; and, surely the
really philanthropic cannot, will not, take my censures amiss, so far at
least, ns they ore in accordance with Truth and Commonsense. If any
of the already established Penny Readings should be improved by the
publication of this pamphlet; or, should any New institutions bo modeled
on better plans than those now in existence, I shall not regret having
devoted a few hours to the service of the Laboring-classes, which, with all
due deference to the Higher-ranks, constitute The People ?
? What constitutes a State ?
Not high-raised battlements, or labored mound,
Thick wall, or moated gate ;
Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned,
Nor bays and broad-armed ports,
Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride ;
Nor starred and spangled courts,
Where low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride?
No! Men, high-minded Men,
With powers as far above dull brutes endued,
In forest, brake, or den,
As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude;
Men, who their duties know,
But, know their rights ; and, knowing, dare maintain
Prevent the long-aimed blow,
And crush the tyrant, while they rend the chain ?
These constitute a State ! Sir W. JoKBS.

It is to the improvement of the Masses, that true philanthropists will
direct their attention, and exert their influence in elevating them socially,
morally, and religiously; and, in the words of Xenophon, I say?
To instruct mankind in things most exeelent, and to honor and applaud those
