HYMN TO THE KING (Haydn.)
PARAPHRASED FROM THE GERMAN.
Chorus.
God preserve our gracious William,
Sovereign, ever good and great.
Save, 0 save him, from mischances,
In prosperity and state.
May his laurels, ever blooming,
Be by patriot virtue fed.
May his worth the world illumine.
And bring back the sheep misled.
God preserve, &c.
Quartette.
From his glorious banners streaming.
May success and plenty flow :
In his Councils brightly beaming,
O, may wisdom, prudence flow !
Fill the hearts of his Commanders
With integrity and zeal—
Be they deaf to lies and slander
’Gainst the Prince and public weal !
God preserve &c.
Chorus.
All thy bounties, good and gracious,
Pour on him, his house, and realm :
And, in mercy, plots audacious
With confusion overwhelm !
By thy law may he be guided :
While submission to his nod
All our safety is confided
In the delegate of God !
God preserve &c.


SONG (Lee.)
Mrs. Taylor.
Come where the aspens quiver,
Down by the flowing river
Bring your guitar;
Sing me the songs I love—
Sing me of fame and glory,
Sing of the poor maid’s story,
When her true love must leave her.
Called to the holy war.
Come where &c.
Come to the wild rose bower
Come at the vesper hour.
Bring your guitar :
Sing me the song I love—
Sing of affection slighted,
Sing of fond hopes blighted.
Sing of the dewy flower,
Sing of the evening star.
Come, come where the aspens quiver &c.
FRENCH SONG (Lechallier.J
“ CUPID AND THE BUTTERFLY.”
f Translation. J
BY MR. KNOWLES.
Young Cupid, full of mirth one day.
Sporting, devoid of care or sigh,
Amused himself amidst his play
In catching a poor butterfly.
“ Spare me, O spare ! ” the insect cried—
“ 1 pray you now some pity shew,
O let me free ! ” —and then he sighed—
“ For I am like yourself, you know.
<• Like you, I’ve wings, and sport and play
On lovely flowers, o’er spangling dew:
Life’s cares I banish far away.
But yet I’m not so light as you.”
The boy, with mingled wrath and pride,
Assured the insect ’twas untrue.
Themis, to have the matter tried,
Her balances now brought to view,


Each party placed, the affair to prove,
Said Themis—“ I would dare to vow
There’s not the difference of a hair,
But should there be, we’ll see it now.”
And when the goddess thus had said.
She raised the balance, when, 0 fye !
’Twas proved that Love, when fairly weighed.
Is lighter than a butterfly !
GERMAN POLACCA fWeher.J
( Translation.)
MR. GORDONOVITCH.
’Tis sweet the gifts surveying
Of friends in absence dear ;
’Tis sweet the sonnets playing
Which they have loved to hear.
To trace the known resemblance,
And gaze on every part.
Each token of remembrance
Restores them to the heart.
The magic of affection
Shall trace her sacred ring.
And charm away dejection.
And Hope’s enchantment bring ;
Revive, in foulest weather.
The calm domestic scene.
And bring old friends together.
Though oceans roar between.
GLEE (Mazzuighi.J
Mr. Alois, Mr. Knowles, and Mrs. Taylor.
Ye Shepherds tell me have you seen.
My Flora pass this way?
In shape and feature beauty’s Queen,
In pastorafarray.
Shepherds tell me, &c.
A wreath around her head she wore.
Carnation, lily, rose,
And in her hand a crook she bore,
And sweets her breath compose.
Shepherds tell me, &c.


The beauteous wreath that decks her head,
Forms her description true,
Hands lily white, lips crimson red,
And cheeks of rosy hue.
Shepherds tell me, &c.
SONG (Sporle.J
By a Young Lady.
Do you ever think of me, love ?
Do you ever think of me ?
When I’m far away from thee, love.
With my barque upon the sea.
My thoughts are ever turning
To thee, where’er I roam,
And my heart is ever yearning.
For the quiet scenes of Home.
Do you ever, &c.
Then tell me do you ever,
When my barque is on the sea.
Give a thought to him who never
Can cease to think of thee.
When sailing o’er the billows.
Do you think I once forget.
The streamlets and the willows,
Beneath whose shade we met ?
No ! I fancy thou art near me.
And I often breathe a sigh.
When the waves alone can hear me,
And the winds alone reply.
Then tell me, do you ever, &c.

DUETT (Bishop.)

Mrs. Taylor, and Mr. Aldis.
ALEXIS.
Dear maid, by ever hope of bliss.
By love’s first pledge, the virgin kiss.
By Heaven and Earth I love thee.
For ever in this heart shall dwell.
The lovely form whose charms compel.
This faltTing tongue to softly tell
How much dear maid I love thee.
ZELINDA.
Tho’ time or place should intervene.
Still, Time that changes every scene,
Would make me still more love thee.
Tho’ far apart as pole from pole,
I still should feel thy loved controul.
While my devoted constant soul
Would but exist to love thee.
While my devoted constant soul, &c. &c.
CAVATINA . (Rossini.)

Oh ! si, per voi gia sento,

GLEE (Shield.)
Mrs. Taylor, Mr. Alois, and Mr. Knowles.
Oh ! why to be happy, a moment forbear,
From a dread that a sorrow may fall to our share ;
Why look for the night, when the sun’s in ms noon.
For come care when it will, we shall know
On the blithe minutes past, no regret will we shed,
But welcome with wine, those which come rn^the^ stead.
And Time bearing witness, to give us our due,
Shall own that we sprinkled his wings as he &c>


SONG.
Mr. Gordonovitch.
Yes, I will leave my father’s halls.
To rove along with thee ;
Adieu, adieu, my native land.
To other scenes I flee.
Yes, we will seek the silent glade,
Where we have stray’d afar ;
And you shall play, my dearest Maid,
Your songs on gay guitar.
Love, gentle love, shall be our guide.
To a far distant land ;
Whither away our way betide,
This heart thou shalt command.
I’ll tell you tales of olden years,
Of hopeless love and war;
And should they cause thee pearly tears.
Resume thy gay guitar.
SONG.
By a Young Lady.
We met, ’twas in a crowd,
And I thought he would shun me ;
He came —I could not breathe.
For his eye was upon me;
He spoke—his words were cold,
And his smile was unalter’d ;
I knew how much he felt,
For his deep-ton’d voice falter’d.
I wore my bridal robe,
And I rivall’d its whiteness —
Brighted gems were in my hair,
How I hated their brightness !
He call’d me by name
As the bride of another—
Oh ! Thou hast been the cause
Of this anguish ! my mother :
And once again we met,
And a fair girl was near him—
He smil’d, and whisper’d low.
As I once us’d to hear him;
She leant upon his arm,


Once ’twas mine, and mine only—
I wept, for I deserv’d
To feel wretched and lonely ;
And she will be his bride !
At the altar he’ll give her.
The love that was too pure
For a heartless deceiver.
The world may think me gay.
For my feelings I smother.
Oh ! thou hast been the cause
Of this anguish ! my mother.
SONG.
By Mrs. Taylor.
When first I heard a tale of love
My heart believed, forsooth !
For others he left me to rove.
Who vowed eternal truth.
I own I sighed, a little while.
But soon I thought ’twas vain.
So trusted in another’s smile
To be deceived again.
Yet still I never grieve, tho’ ninety-nine deceive.
I’ll try again a new one.
And chance may have it so, that Cupid with his bow,
Shall bring me down a true one.
The folk in our village say that I’m a young Coquette,
But is it fault of mine I pray, that I am single yet;
What tho’ a maiden answer “No why can’t the creatures
guess
That when she only whispers so, she’d have them think it
“ Yes
But still, &c.
SONG.
Mr. Gordonovitch.
Gp, Comrades up, see the morn’s o’er the mountains.
Rouse from your slumber and rush on the foe,
Tho’ bright and clear now, ’ere evening- the fountains
Dark with the blood of the slaughtered shall flow !


’Tis our last struggle for freedom and honour,
Blow your wild trumpets and call up the brave !
fight for your Country, shame is upon her.
On to the conflict, to die or to save.
Farewell ye dear ones (that ’ere the invader
Wasted our vallies) softened and charmed,
J he hearts of our Country with feelings that made her
est beloved home that romance ever warmed.
Here to guitar we’ve been sighing inglorious,
But spear and shield to our grasp now are given.
We’ll meet yet again ’ere the night, if victorious,
Jt not, adieu then—we’ll meet yet in heaven !
Up, Comrades up, see the morn’s o’er the mountains.
House from your slumbers and rush on to the foe,
Jho bright and clear now, ’ere evening the fountains
Dark with the blood of the slaughtered shall flow.
And tho’ we die—we shall yet live in story.
True hearts we’ll prove to our country and name ;
JJeath may have terrors, but still there’s a glory
Jn dying for native land. Freedom and Fame.

Oh, Lady fair ! where is he going.

SOLO AND GRAND DOUBLE CHORUS. — (Purcell.)
Come if you dare, our trumpets sound.
Come if you dare, the foes rebound.
We come, we come, we come, we come,
Says the double beat of the thund’ring drum.
Now they charge on a main,
Now they rally again,
The God’s from above the mad labour behold.
And pity mankind that will perish for gold,
The fainting Russians quit the ground,
The trumpets languish in their sound,
They fly, they fly, they fly, they fly,
Victoria, the bold Lancers cry.
Now the Victory’s won
To the plunder we run
We return to our lasses, like fortunate traders.
Triumphant with spoils of our vanquish’d invaders,
r Come you dare, &c. &c.
