It is not our intention to re-tell the great
story of the Australians’ landing on Gal-
lipoli, nor to speak of the bravery of those
gallant men who took part in the historic
event.
As members of the A.1.F., we aim to see
the day proclaimed a public holiday by
Federal and State Governments.
When Anzac Day comes round each year
we realise that the public holiday aspect of
the day is of secondary consideration, and
that the sentimental side of the matter ap-
peals most strongly to the returned men in
the city and country. It is urged by many
that sentiment is dead, but there is no death
for the sentiments that actuate returned men
in observing April 25 as a day distinct from
all others.
Individual Diggers have their own idea
as to the most fitting manner of celebrat-
ing the anniversary, and because the Digger
is not by nature a hypocrite, it is impossible
to establish any set rule for the universal
observance of the anniversary of any one
day, selected from such a series of days as
were experienced in the Great War.
ANZAC DAY
APRIL 25th, 1915—1921
Relatives and dependents are largely in-
fluenced by the fate that befell their boys,
thus the proud mother of a returned soldier
glories in his 1914-’l5 Star, whereas the
mother of the fallen hero regards the trophy
as just an outward acknowledgement of duty
nobly done.
“THE SOUL OF ANZAC”
GEN. SIR. Wm. BIRDWOOD
(G.C.M.G., K.C.B.I., K.C.S.T. C.I.E.,
D.S.O., A.D.C.),
Sentiment is, however, not dead. It was
sentiment that prompted boat load after
boat load of our boys to hurry to the as-
sistance of their comrades on the great day
of the landing, and it was sentiment that
ontrolled the marvel, ious recovery and re-
organisation of our scattered forces on the
morning of the 26th. Sentiment it was that
prevented many a sick man going to hos-
pital at the expense of his mates, and sen-
timent has caused the banding together of
all returned soldiers into this great League
of ours. It is this sentiment that we wish
to foster, the true sentiment that has stood
the test of battle, the real Australian senti-
ment that means safety to the nation.
Anzac Day to us Is as the foundation
stone of a magnificent building to the archi-
tect. From the moment it is well and truly
laid, he watches it grow from day to day
and takes pride in every addition to its
future utility—and surely the foundation
stone of Australian Nationhood may be said
to exist in the head stones of Gallipoli! the
first Australian cemetery in the Great War
for justice and freedom.
This, then, is our idea of Anzac Day—
Australia’s birthday!

LEAGUE’S MESSAGE
The following resolution was recently
carried by the New South Wales Branch
of the League :
“That, in view of the official demobilisa-
tion of the A.1.F., effected as from to-
day, this council places on record its hope
that the traditions of the A.I.F. will never
be allowed to die, and that all ex-members
of the A.I.F. will, as the years roll on,
stand together in civilian life as they did
in time of war, all imbued with a desire
to serve Australia with that spirit of self-
sacrifice and loyalty with which, as sailors
and soldiers, they served Australia and
the Empire, inculcating loyalty and secur-
ing patriotic service in the interests of
both as is laid down in the constitution
of this League.”
R. HASTINGS, A.A.I.S.,
State Secretary, N.S.W. Branch.


ANZAC DAY
Specially written for the occasion, and presented to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers ’ Imperial League.
Now over every head
The ferns and grasses sway
Soon to be gold and red
When April meets with May:
But underneath the flowers they
keep no holiday.
And yet, if they could live
Through their young lives again,
Once more if they could give
Their service and their pain,
Surely within their eyes the laughter
would remain.
BY ADAM McCAY.
Their voices whisper; “Mourn
No longer for us dead ;
Let not your hearts be torn,
Or bitter tears be shed ;
But let your music sound trium-
phantly instead.”
No clang of muffled bell
Sobbing its funeral woe,
No black-draped citadel.
Or solemn chant and slow
For those brave souls as on their
infinite way they go :
But our clean joy will Wdke
An equal joy in them,
Our smiling eyes will make
Their heavenly diadem :
And our glad singing be their
happiest requiem.


“ANZAC”-SACRIFICE.
The following resolution was recently
carried by a body of workmen camped
ten miles from the nearest town :
“We, the employees of the Tingha
Hydraulic and Irrigation Scheme,
while appreciating the action of the
Federal Government in proclaiming
Anzac Day a public holiday, do not
think that it gives adequate expres-
sion of one’s feelings towards the
memory of those boys who made
the supreme sacrifice or tends in
any way to bring a little comfort or
happiness to the widows and child-
ren left behind, nor does it tend
to alleviate the suffering of those
who came back maimed and broken
in health. In order to give tangible
proof of our deep gratitude to the
boys, we resolve to work on Anzac
Day and give the day’s wages to a
soldiers’ fund, and we trust that
our fellow workers throughout Aus-
tralia will join with us in celebrat-
ing the day in the manner indicated,
and that the employers will give
*Fe profits of that day to the fund.”
We are proud to include in this sou-
venir such a sweet breath wafted from
the Australian bush.
The silent moments that precede the
opening of our meetings, in memory
of our fallen comrades, are often the
means of softening any bitter thoughts
that imiay exist in our minds, thus
influencing our speeches during the
evening’s deliberations.
.As we stand in silence, our thoughts
naturally fly to our individual mates
who fell, and many of us do not have
to visualise graves in distant lands in
order to see, in fancy, their last resting
places.
Many of us had comrades on the
other side—in France, Palestine, Galli-
poli and Egypt with whom we re-
mained in close friendship on return
to Australia.
Some of these lads only came home
to die, in spite of devoted care in hos-
pitals ! They lie in graves in their
native land—are these graves tended
with the same love and care as those
in distant battlefield cemetries? Yes,
if the departed had relatives in Aus-
tralia ; no, if he was just a “lonely
Digger” as were many of the boys.
It is concerning the graves of these
of our fallen comrades that we appeal
for a little attention.
Anzac Day would be a fitting day for
a party of volunteers to go forth and
visit the cemetries to tidy up any neg-
lected graves of returned men they may
find. And there are many!
“A* few flowers, a work of love,
Perhaps a tear for those above.
For soldiers’ tears are apt to fall,
Their hearts are big, in spite of all.”
Charles Davis.
FALLEN COMRADES.


AUSTRALIA ANSWERS.
How did you answer England’s cry, when It fell upon your ear?
With four hundred thousand fighting men, each one a volunteer 1
And where did you come to England’s aid, when she called you over the seaP
We came to her at the ANZAC Cove—we came at Gallipoli.
We came in the dawn of an April day that was sweet with the young Spring s breath,
And the hounds of Hell were waiting us there, with a devil s trap of death.
And what did you do to foil the foe, when you reached that steep cliff path P
Go ask the Cyclone to tell you the way it tears through the earth in wrath 1
Go ask the Lightning to tell you the tale of its felling a forest tree 1
Or the terrible story of tidal waves, as they rush inland from the sea I
For that is the way we swept up over the Turks at Gallipoli 1
And our dead we left in the devil’s trap, and our dead we left on the hill
We know are alive on the Other Side, and loving and helping us still.
For the Soul of a man who dies for the Right, is stronger when free from clay .
And the boys who went down in that April dawn are with us day by day.
Four hundred thousand fighting men—all volunteers to a man 1
And each one built in body and mind, on the big Australian plan.
We have the courage that God sends down to earth through open spaces .
Where men can see sun’s rise and set, and feel the wind on their races.
And this was the courage that drove us up the cliff through the smoke of guns
To plant our banner upon it’s peak, and tear down the rag of the Huns,
And it won us the right to wear the name of England s loyal sons.
How did we answer our Mother’s call when it fell upon our ear?
With four hundred thousand fighting men, and each one a volunteer i
