Preface
It was not intended that this should be a detailed history
of the battalion, but rather a brief sketch of the chief
events during the past four years.
Owing to the difficulties both in writing and preserv-
ing, many of the earlier records, even when written, have
been mislaid or destroyed, leaving in one case a gap of
many months.
Later, however, when some of these records do come
to hand, a fuller account will doubtless be written.
The majority of the material has been taken from
The Battalion and 3rd Brigade War Diaries, Sir lan
Hamilton’s Dispatches, and John Masefield’s “ Gallipoli.”
I have to thank Major J. L. Treloar, Lieut. J. Balfour,
and “War Records ” Staff for the great assistance they have
given, and for permission to use the official photographs.
Many of the more recent of these are not yet available,
but will be within a few weeks.
The book I have dedicated to The Australian “ Digger,”
A man of “ infinite variety ” ; rough often in manner and
speech, but warm of heart and true as steel, with a never-
failing sense of humour that has carried him through many
a hard time ; and with a capacity for being led only
equalled by that of refusing to be driven. In all —soldier,
sportsman, friend.

History of the 10th Battalion
A.I.F.
Contrary to the expectations and hopes of Germany,
Australia did not seize the apparently golden opportunity,
which the war presented, of casting herself free from
British rule, but instantly decided that where the mother-
country was threatened there Australia must be repre-
sented.
England declared war on the 4th of August, and by
the sth many men had already offered their services ;
and when, by the 16th, the machinery for enrolling and
attesting had been set in motion, there was a great rush
to join up.
The medical test was too stringent to allow many
who wished to come away, and hundreds of men not quite
up to the standard were turned down, most of them to
reappear shortly for further attempts.
On the 19th, Lt.-Col. Weir, having been chosen to
command the 10th Infantry Battalion, which was to be
South Australia’s quota to the Australian Expeditionary
Force, and having previously selected his staff, proceeded
to Mr. Hawke’s estate at Morphettville, and commenced
enrolling and attesting.
The next few weeks were busy ones spent in equipping,
organising, and training men of all ages, occupations and
dispositions into something like a fighting quit.
By the middle of October arrangements were suffi-
ciently completed for transferring the force to its unknown
but much conjectured destination, and, after one or two
false alarms, the 10th Battalion, 1,001 strong, embarked
on s.s. Ascanius on 20th October, and at 4.30. p.m the
same day left the Outer Harbour.
Those who saw them, South Australia’s first contri-
B


bution to the world war, leave, and many who did not, will
never forget that day.
Some of them were men who had already seen service
and knew something of the meaning of war ; many were
mere boys who did not realise what they had to face—■
nor had they known, would it have made any difference
—others were men in or past the prime of life, leaving
behind a business or trade which would never afterwards
be the same, but the same spirit possessed them all as
they left the shores of their birth. England’s and hu-
manity’s cause needed help, and what small assistance
they could render they were willing to give.
Some would not return to the country for many
months, some would come back crippled for life, many
there were amongst that crowd who, before many months
had elapsed, would have given their all without a murmur
for those things they valued more dearly than life itself.
Such was the battalion as it left Australia. The
men were keen, resourceful and fearless, from every
State in Australia, and from almost every town in the
Central State.
Men from banks, mines, shops, foundries, farms and
business houses, of utterly different dispositions and
tastes, all welded into one single body, with a common
desire to see the Motherland, Europe, the World through
the crisis through which it was passing.
As a fighting entity then totally unknown to them-
selves, to the British Empire, to the world in general,
they have made the traditions which have been so jealously
guarded and upheld ever since.
On the 25th, after picking up the greater part of the
nth Battalion at Fremantle, which was left on the
2nd November, the Ascanius set out for the main convoy
which it joined on the 4th.
At 7.15 on the morning of the 9th, the wireless inter-
cepted an S.O.S. message from Cocos ; H.M.A.S. Sydney
immediately steamed West, and at 11.15 a.m. the following
message was received.
“ Emden beached and done for.” The enthusiasm
was tremendous on board the boats. The Australian
Navy had tasted blood in its first naval engagement, and
had been successful.
After this the trip to Colombo was uneventful, and
that port being reached on the 15th the convoy lay out-

side till the 17th. Shortly after leaving Colombo the
Ascanius collided with the Shropshire, causing a rent
26 feet in length in the side of the forward bow of the
former.
The men fell in in perfect order with lifebelts, and •
stood to on the boat decks. Luckily, however, the rend
was above the water line, the sea calm, and no water
was made.
On December sth, after passing Aden, Suez, and Port
Said, the boat arrived at Alexandria.
The next day, Sunday, 6th, the wharf was reached,
and on Monday the battalion disembarked and entrained
to Cairo, moving from there to Mena Camp, where it
remained in training for nearly three months.
After a training as vigorous as it was thorough —-
combing out as it did all who were not in the “ pink ”
of condition—the battalion set out on its next step in
the great adventure.
During the few short weeks, however, Cairo and its
environs saw a great deal of these brown and hefty
trainees, and by the end of that time, there were few
places which were not known and explored by them.
The pyramids. Sphinx, and the thousand wonders of
a country with such a past, the very antiquity of the
place, the spirit of the desert, which somewhat resembled
their own land in some of its characteristics, cast their
inevitable spell over the hearts of the men, and many
there were who were genuinely sorry to leave it.
On February 28th the camp at Mena was left. The
battalion entrained at Cairo for Alexandria, and the
next day, together with the 9th Battalion, embarked on
the s.s. lonian.
Leaving on March 2nd, the boat arrived at Lemnos
on the 4th after an uneventful trip. Here the gth Bat-
talion disembarked, landing at Mudros, where it camped
in tents ; the 10th, however, remained on board the
lonian for their seven weeks’ stay, landing when the
weather permitted at Telikna Point for training.
The accommodation on board the ship, however, was
not all that could be desired from the men’s point of
view ; the ventilation was far from good, men slept on
the decks, which were hard, often damp, and always alive
with vermin.
Towards the middle of April, the project of the land-

ing on Gallipoli became known, and on the 16th the
battalion was taken in boats to H.M.S. Prince of Wales,
to practise disembarking and landing. This was repeated
two or three times and the men soon became expert
in rope climbing and descent.
It was here that the colours, purple and blue, were
issued to the men to sew on their tunics. By the 24th, all
preparations being complete, “ B ” and “ C ” Companies,
under Major Oldham and Captain Jacob, plus Battalion
H.Q., transferred from the lonian to H.M.S. Prince of
Wales, and later on “A” and “ D ” Companies, under
Major Beevor and Captain Herbert, to the destroyers
Foxhound and Scourge.
Sir lan Hamilton had made a personal reconnaissance
of the Peninsula, and had selected S. Y. X. V. W. —Z
(Gaba Tepe)—Kumkale as landing places. At the first
five, the main thrust, the 29th Division were to attack,
Z beach, near Gaba Tepe, being allotted to the Australian
and N.Z. Army Corps, while the French were to create a
diversion and draw fire at Kumkale,
The boats, escorted by a squadron of the Fleet, sailed
out of Mudros Bay on the afternoon of April 24th, and
arrived at the rendezvous just after 1.30 a.m. At 3 a.m.
Sunday, “B ” and “ C ” Companies and B.H.Q. left
H.M.S. Prince of Wales in lifeboats, and were towed to
within 50 yards of the shore—this was done in abso-
lute silence. The weather was perfect, dawn was just
breaking, and the tension of feeling was almost at breaking
point ; so still was everything that it was thought that
the landing would be unopposed, but when about 30 yards
from the beach, one solitary rifle opened fire closely fol-
lowed by others, until the whole beach was swept with a
terrific rifle and machine-gun fire—but still the boats
moved on.
they were rowed in as close as possible to the beach
in about 3 feet of water, often more, and the men leapt
into the water and with full packs waded ashore. Some
were killed before they left the boats, some, wounded in
the water, never got out alive, but the others, flinging
aside their packs and fixing their bayonets, charged the
Turks, who broke and fled, closely pursued by men of the
9th, 10th, nth Battalions, who were all mixed together.
Shortly after the “A” and “ D ” Companies reached
the beach, and under heavy shrapnel and machine-gun

lire pushed on and joined in the general advance. By
8.30 a.m. they were about one mile inland and holding
the big hill and ridge in front of it ; then, pushing on to
Shrapnel Hill, tried to reorganise.
“ All over the broken cliffs there were isolated fights
to the death. No man on our side knew that cracked and
fissured jungle. Men broke through it on to machine
guns and bombs. It was only just light. Theirs was the
first survey of that wild country. They pressed on up the
cliff—dropped—fired—died. They drove the Turks back,
wormed their way through bushes, stalking and sniping.
“ There was no thought of surrender —they were the
flower of this world’s manhood, and they died as they
had lived, owning no master on this earth.”*
The shape of the ground which had been won was a
rough semicircle, with the beach, about 1,000 yards, for
its diameter.
By 2 p.m. the 12,000 men of the Ist, 2nd, and 3rd
Brigades had been landed, together with two Indian
Mountain Batteries.
At 4.15 p.m. the Turks delivered two counter-attacks
against the 3rd Brigade and the left of the 2nd, and for
four hours they attacked from superior positions with
many guns, in overwhelming numbers and with fresh
troops, 8,000 at most of our tired and disorganised men.
The guns from the ships opened on them, and the attack
for the time gradually withered away.
Then came the darkness, but with it no rest —the
night was bitterly cold, and all night long the men toiled
at the digging, only stopping to beat back an enemy
attack.
All night long they laboured with little or no food,
digging, carrying, fighting, and when day came the Turks
again attacked with overwhelming superiority in men and
artillery and position, but again, with the aid of the guns
from the ships, the Turks were driven back, beaten and
broken, and our men, seizing the opportunity, charged
and seized new ground and dug in. By the night of the
26th the position had been consolidated.
“ They had proved how vain the German brag that we
would never be able to land.”
On the body of a Turk officer was found a letter to
his wife full of personal matters containing the following :
* John Masefield’s “ Gallipoli.”


“ These British are the finest fighters in the world ; we
have chosen the wrong friends.’
To use Vice-Admiral John de Robeck’s words :
“ At Gaba Tepe the landing and dash of the Australian
Brigade for the cliffs was magnificent—nothing could
stop such men. The Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps in this, their first battle, set a standard as high as
that of any army in history, and one of which their country-
men have every reason to be proud.” The news of their
landing flew across the seas. Their country was proud of
them and paid tribute to the men who had fallen in their
first battle.
In the meantime the men, completely exhausted by
the tremendous exertion, without proper food or rest,
and under the constant strain of counter-attacks, made
by a desperate and ever reinforced enemy, on the 28th
were relieved by a Battalion of the R.M.L. Infantry, and
marching to “ Shell Green,” bivouacked in the small
gully. _
I hirteen officers, 380 other ranks answered the roll
call. Here the battalion rested until the Ist of May,
when it relieved the 9th Battalion on the extreme right,
and on the sth of May relieved the nth Battalion further
on the left.
During the next three weeks the artillery fire was
constant and the fighting continuous.
On the night g-ioth, an assault was delivered against
the enemy positions at Quinn’s Post, which was captured
at the point of the bayonet, but the next day, during the
counter-attack, had to be evacuated ; but our guns did
great work, and a captured Turk diary said that 600
Turks had been killed and 2,000 wounded. So the days
wore on. Russia, who was to have rendered assistance
by an attack in the North, was hard pressed in Poland,
and the Turk reserves, which she would have diverted,
were now available for use against our forces on the
Peninsula.
Nothing more could be done until further and fresh
forces could be obtained—until then there was nothing to
do but to hold on.
On May 19th the enemy attacked in great force. They
came on in two solid lines, but they were mown down
by our fire, and the attack like the others came to
nothing.

So great was the stench from the bodies that, on the
24th, an armistice was granted from 7.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m.
for the purpose of burying the dead, and over 3,000 Turks
were buried that day.
Summer was almost at hand, and with it came the
plague of flies and other insects which made life almost
unbearable. The heat was awful, good water, scarce at
the beginning, was daily becoming scarcer —the wells
which had supplied much of it had with the hot weather
completely given out, and two-thirds of the water supply
had to be brought from abroad and stored.
The daily ration of water, sometimes in the intensest
heat, for all purposes did not exceed a pint or at most
a pint and a half.
On the top of this came diarrhoea, dysentery and
fever, until nearly every man on Gallipoli was suffering
from disease, with vitality considerably lowered. From
the Bth to the nth of June the battalion had a short
respite at Imbros. The men lived in tents, with an
ample supply of wood, water and rations. Bathing was
frequent, and fruit and sundry groceries were obtainable
there. The spell, short though it was, was much appre-
ciated, being like a huge picnic.
On the nth, Sunday evening, the battalion returned
to Anzac, and on the 13th relieved the nth Battalion
in the line.
With the return, under the constant fatigues and
strain, the diarrhoea became very bad.
And yet while these things were going on, in addition
to their own duties in the front line, the men at Anzac
in preparation for the force which had to be landed and
hidden until ready for the vital attack in August, dug
no less than 20 miles of trenches —accommodation for
30,000 men, and during the nights 3rd, 4th, and sth
August, besides helping to disembark that force, carried
ashore 1,000 tons of shells, cartridges, and food, hundreds
of horses and mules, many guns, and 200 or 300 water
and ammunition carts.
The first blow in April had failed to open the Narrows
to the Fleet, owing to the inability to press on, due to
lack of fresh troops. It was believed and hoped that
the second attempt —consisting of an attack at Flelles
to contain the Turks in the South, one on the right of
Anzac to hold the Turks at Anzac, and men on the left


of Anzac landing at Suvla to deal the main blow on Sari
Bair —would be successful.
And if Sari Bair —the ridge that dominated the Anzac
position —were taken, it would mean the closing of the
road to Turk reinforcements and the opening of the
Narrows to the Fleet. It meant victory, and the beginning
of the end of the war.
In the August operations, the battalion, with the
exception of holding the existing lines played no active
part.
On the 6th a desperate battle began at Helles which
lasted for seven days, and certainly succeeded in achieving
its end of holding the Turks forces in the South.
During the 3rd, 4th, sth, and 6th, Lone Pine defences
in front of Anzac Position were subjected to bombard-
ment from the warships, and at 5.30 p.m. on the 6th
the attacking force of the Ist Brigade rushed the enemy
trenches, and after a tremendous hand-to-hand conflict
had, by 6.20 p.m. captured and consolidated the position.
The next day, August 7th, for five hours the enemy
attacked, and with bomb and bayonet tried to drive out
our men, but despite the casualties, which were great,
the position was held. During this time the men held
on for five more days amid the stench of corpses five to
the yard, until Lone Pine was ours.
In the main battle of Suvla, the four columns, two
to protect flanks, and two to work up the Deres, the dry
water courses, which led to the heart of the high ground
of Chunuk Bair and Koja Chemin Tepe, met strong oppo-
sition.
These Deres, however, were taken and cleared, and
after tremendous losses on the Bth, Chunuk Bair was
taken on the right ; the centre was held near Hill 0,
while the left had been forced back. Both sides were
practically exhausted. Fresh troops would turn the tide
of victory in favour of either side. It was a race with
the Turk for reserves. Would the troops landing at
Suvla be in time ?
The confusion in landing, and the difficulty in com-
munication, preventing the earlier despatch of the sorely
needed troops, decided the issue. When they arrived
it was too late. The race had been run and the Turk
had won, and when the troops did arrive the Turks were
there before them.

“ The left had failed ; the main blow of the battle
of Sari Bair (to which Lone Pine was but a side
show to divert the enemy) was to receive no help from
Suvla.”
A blow was delivered, howeve despite the lack of
help from Suvla, but at the last moment, when the issue
seemed certain, victory was snatched from our hands,
and on the 10th the Turks, seeing our line waver, attacked
in mass with 15,000 men. “ They came packed shoulder
to shoulder,” and swept down on our men. Rank after
rank was shot down and still they came on, but when they
swarmed over the crest at Chunuk Bair, from which our
men were driven, the guns from the ships opened on them.
“ They died in thousands,” but they still came on until
finally they were brought up by our reserves.
The thrust for Sari Bair had failed. On the 21st of
August the 29th Division by a brilliant success at Scimitar
Hill secured the position at Suvla Bay, but after that no
other attempt was made to pierce the Peninsula.
In the five days’ fighting one quarter of the Army had
been lost, and the reserves of ammunition shot away.
And now the dysentery which had been bad before,
increased beyond all measure. Flies and vermin were
everywhere, and the men’s health gave way under the
strain. They were evacuated at the rate of hundreds
per day, utterly exhausted and worn out by privation
and disease.
Since the main object had failed, the question arose
as to whether the force of 100,000 men on Gallipoli were
containing enough Turks to justify their remaining on
the Peninsula. It was decided that they were not, and
the blizzard towards the end of November hastened the
preparations for embarkation.
The 3rd Brigade, however, did not wait until the
general evacuation in December. At 21.00 on the 16th
November, the 9th and nth Battalions embarked for
Mudros, followed by the 10th and 12th on the 21st and
25th respectively.
They had no sooner arrived at Mudros than the blizzard
which caused so many casualties on Gallipoli, came upon
them. That blizzard “ which in four days by flood and
frost caused 200 deaths, 10,000 unfit for further service,
and 30,000 sickened and made old.”
On the Bth of December the evacuation of Anzac
c


was ordered to begin, and on the night 19th —20th, our
men left Anzac unmolested.
“ They had lost no honour—they had failed to take
Gallipoli, but they had fought a battle such as has never
been fought upon the earth. What they had done will
become a glory for ever, wherever the deeds of heroic
and unhelped men are honoured, pitied and understood.
“ Ihey went up against an impregnable fort, without
guns, without munitions, without help, and without
drink ; they climbed a scarp, and held it by their own
glorious manhood, quickened by a word from their chief.”*
So they left the country of their first great adventure,
but often their thoughts turned back to that little cove
where :
There’s a lonely stretch of hillocks :
There’s a beach asleep and drear :
There’s a battered broken fort beside the sea.
There are sunken trampled graves ;
And a little rotting pier :
And winding paths that wind unceasingly.
" There’s a torn and silent valley ;
There’s a tiny rivulet
With some blood upon the stones beside its mouth
There are lines of buried bones :
There’s an unpaid waiting debt ;
There’s a sound of gentle sobbing in the South.
On the 26th of December the battalion left Lemnos and
arrived on the 29th at Alexandria, where it disembarked
and entrained to Tel-el-Kebir.
towards the end of January, after having spent the
time in resting, reorganising and training, the 3rd brigade
proceeded to the Suez Canal Defences at Habieta, where
it spent nearly two months in an outpost system digging
trenches that filled in often as fast as they were dug.
Here it was that the battalions were split to form
the 4th division, each battalion sending 500 all ranks.
The sister battalion to the 10th was the 50th battalion.
Despite this drain on its strength the battalion was
soon full strength again, and on the 28th of March it
embarked on the Saxonia, together with the 9th battalion
and brigade headquarters bound for France.

GALLIPOLI


FRANCE, 1916
Marseilles was reached on April 2nd, and after a three-
days’ train journey through some of the most beautiful
parts of France, a revelation in freshness and beauty
after the barren plains of Egypt, the battalion billeted
in the vicinity of Strazeele.
Two days later the transport, which had been re-
equipped at Abbeville, rejoined the battalion.
At Strazeele, the time was spent in training and in-
struction in the new kind of gas helmet (p.h.), and after
about a fortnight the battalion proceeded on the 20th
to Sadly where it billeted in divisional reserve.
Here, the battalion had a very happy training ground,
the sector was a quiet one, the inhabitants were living
practically in the line, and they were nothing if not hos-
pitable. If this was a sample of warfare in France the
“ Digger ” was convinced that “ it would do him.”
The 25th of April, the anniversary of the landing on
Gallipoli, brought back many a memory both pleasant
and otherwise to the men who, for seven months, had
made that small patch of land a home. The same day
an inspection was held by Generals Plumer, Walker, and
McLagan, followed, two days later, by one by Sir Douglas
Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in
France.
On the night of June 6th, the Battalion went into the
line for the first time in France, and remained in for the
rest of the month. Twice during that time gas alarms
were sounded, but no gas came.
Though at times the artillery fire on both sides was
fairly heavy, and a raid was made on the nth battalion,
Hie sector was a quiet one—the casualties for the month
in the line not amounting to more than twenty-five.
This sort of thing, however, could not last —in the
next two months events occurred which again proved
the worth of the Australians who had stood the test so
well fifteen months before at Gallipoli.
For the first time, the British leaders in France felt
that they had sufficient troops and munitions on the
Western Front to justify a departure from the defensive
which had been forced on them owing to the shortage
of both.




The place chosen for this offensive was the Somme
area in the vicinity, of Albert, a place as yet unknown
to the men—but a place which came to be known later
as no other part of France.
Here, twice within a month, supported and opposed
by a barrage of which they had never seen or heard the
like, where more shells were fired in one day than they
had seen in a month, where whole armies were massed
on small fronts, with a gun for every few yards of front,
were they to meet and pit themselves against a foe, often
unseen, armed with every weapon modern warfare could
invent, and trained in the use of them all from youth up,
waiting for an opportunity such as this to use them.
On Saturday night, 22nd July, the battalion left
Sausage Valley and proceeded via Black Watch Alley
to support the 9th battalion in the attack on Pozieres.
On the morning of the 23rd, the gth battalion
met strong opposition. “A” Company, under Captain
McCann, was sent to their assistance ; their advance also
was held by machine-gun fire, and Captain McCann
wounded. A barricade was erected. “D ” Company,
under Major Giles, was then despatched to the help of
“ A.”
Here Lieut. Blackburn won his V.C. Detailed with
a party to clear up the position which was holding up
the advance, he broke down the barricade in the trench,
and bombed back the enemy.
Then with four men he tried to locate the machine
gun hre which was doing the damage. The four men
with him were killed, and he had to return for help.
Again, with another four he advanced supported by
trench mortars, but losing these men also he returned
and reported.
Supported at this time by artillery, and with Sergeant
Biwood and three men, he again went forward and dis-
covered a trench cutting the one they were occupying
at right angles, this was captured and consolidated, but
Sergeant Inwood, who had done magnificent work, and
his men were killed.
After three days without sleep, often without other
food than the troops had with them, and even when the
food was available with little time or desire to eat, with a
hre around them that was deafening and unceasing, and
which threatened every moment to become unbearable ;

living in trenches that were trenches no longer, but mere
shell holes of churned and beaten soil, buried, dug out,
gassed and tired, they staggered out from the battered
trenches lined with mangled bodies, choked with wounded,
almost stunned and exhausted, and after a little more
than three weeks’ spell—having lost roughly half their
rifle strength, though reinforced a little since—they were
back again, hammering away at a similar sector which
went by the name of Moquet Farm, on ground which
seemed to spit death at every yard.
Before the attack was launched over 120 casualties
had been sustained, and before the battalion was relieved
many more were added to that already long list. Often
the officers and men hadn’t had a chance to see the ground
before, and had no definite idea of what or where they
were to attack, except that it was somewhere “ out there.”
So mixed did the affair become that several times, before
the end of the fight, our own battalions found themselves
fighting one with the other, and not realising it till many
casualties had been inflicted.
Men disappeared, were posted as missing, believed
killed, and not heard of again till two years or so later,
when postcards were received from Germany telling of
their capture.
The runners here, as always, did wonderful work.
Like men possessed, heedless of the risk they ran, they
dashed from one place to another, delivering messages that
broken telephone wires refused to let through.
On the night 22-23 the battalion was relieved by the
21st battalion and entrained shortly afterwards at
Doullens for Belgium.
The brief spell following, and the quiet sector some-
what similar to Sailly, worked wonders in the battalion,
and the constant arrival of large batches of reinforcements
quickly filled the gaps made vacant by the wasting opera-
tions of the Somme.
The casualties when the battalion came out of the
Hill 60 sector after about a month in the forward area,
amounted to 1 officer and 29 other ranks, a marked decrease
on the previous month.
On the qth October the battalion, in conjunction with
the brigade, began a four days’ route march, stopping at
nights at Steenvoorde, Oosthouck, Mouille, and Tournehem
respectively, and after three days’ rest and training at


the last-mentioned place, entrained at Audruicq for the
South.
Detraining at Pont Remy (near Abbeville), the batta-
lion began working up by motor bus and route march to
the Somme area again.
Up to now the weather, which had been fairly fine,
began to break, and as the battalion moved up into areas
only too familiar, they found that the rain and constant
traffic had turned the churned earth into mud.
As railways were just being laid, most of the supplies
had to be transported by the roads, which were taxed
to their uttermost day and night. Guns, lorries, wagons,
ambulances, cars, in strings of many miles blocked the
roads holding up the traffic for hours on end.
For travelling distances of a few kilometres it became
necessary to leave at daybreak to get back before dark.
The march from Fricourt to Bernafay Wood, a distance
of about five kilometres, started at 10 a.m., was not com-
pleted till about half-past four in the afternoon, and when
the camp was finally reached, the men, drenched to the
skin by pouring rain, covered with mud from head to
foot, had to bivouac in shallow dugouts in places inches
deep in water.
The constant rain had soaked the sides of the trenches
until both parapet and parados collapsed, falling into the
already deep mud and making the whole an impassable
bog.
It was into this that the battalion moved on November
6th near Gucudccourt. The men, weighed down by the
endless string of things that had to be carried when going
into the line, extra ammunition, bombs, rations, sand-
bags, and water ; in the dark sliding along loose, slippery
and sloping duck-boards, with a fair chance of missing
them at least once, and plunging into a shell hole up to
the neck in ice-cold mud.
Finally, after leaving the duck-boards far behind,
and travelling over what was worse, mud deep and sticky,
the trenches were reached. Then the rain which for a
time had held off came on again, and the water rose knee-
and thigh-deep in places. Nowhere was there a dry
place. Men moving about from place to place sank in
the mud, and, struggling to release themselves, sank
deeper into the mire till pulled out by someone more
fortunate.
November 6
Gueudecourt


BELGIUM




Men fortunate enough to have gum boots had to
leave them in the mud and wander in their socks across
the mud and mire.
A week of this, lasting from the 6th to the 12th, tried
the hearts of the strongest. For the first day there was
little sickness, but after that the exposure and continuously
sodden feet began to give trouble. Men with feet aching
beyond endurance had to give in, dragging themselves
back to the aid-post for treatment and evacuation. Many
having removed their boots to rub their feet found that
they could not get them on again and had to walk out
without them. Men, whom no Turk or German bom-
bardment had ever daunted, gave way under the strain,
and in that week 150 were evacuated for feet trouble
alone, and another 70 shortly after, as unable to march.
There was little or no hot food : a few Tommy cookers
were supplied, but out of all proportion to the number of
men. Despite this the men were wonderfully cheerful.
The Q.M. and Transport had no easy task. Wandering
over trackless mud at all hours of the night, sinking in the
mud, slipping into shell holes and keeping the direction
in spite of all was no easy task, but it was accomplished
without mishap.
It was the first and worst winter in France, and on
one of the worst sectors, and the battalions were learning
by bitter experience. The percentage of trench feet for
this period was enormous, and was the highest in the British
Armies in France.
Right throughout the Army it was felt that something
must be done, and done quickly, and when three weeks
later, after having a brief spell in the area of Cardonctte
(near Amiens), the battalion once more found itself in
the same area, the good effects of the new system, consist-
ing of hot drinks and foods, together with changes of
socks with specially prepared powder, speedily showed
themselves, and for the period from December 12th to
22nd spent by the battalion in the line in a very similar
sector to the previous one—the total evacuations for
sickness dropped to one officer, 26 other ranks, and about
this time the figures for the A.I.F. dropped from the
highest to the lowest in the army.
A tribute might here be paid to the magnificent work
done by the Y.M.C.A., Red Cross, and Australian Comforts
Fund. At all hours of the day and night, and as near
Cardonette


the line as they were permitted to go, the men of these
institutions, cheery and tireless, served out hot drinks of
tea, cocoa or coffee, and biscuits to men utterly exhausted,
putting fresh life and hope into them.
On the 24th December the Christmas parcels were
distributed, and the next day the men spent an enjoyable
Christmas on fatigues.
January saw the men looking forward to the Spring.
First, because the sun would begin to have a little warmth ;
secondly, because it was hoped that the Spring Offensive
would go a long way towards finishing what the Somme
offensive had begun, and perhaps a break through ob-
tained.
This, however, to a certain degree, was avoided by the
enemy. Knowing that the position he now occupied was
much inferior to one but a few kilometres in the rear, and
ground being no object to him ; besides hoping to post-
pone the Allied offensive in the Spring by causing dis-
organisation, towards the end of February, having made
his preparations, he quietly evacuated his old line and
retired, fighting a rear-guard action the while, to a line
afterwards known as the Hindcnburg Line.
It was some time before his withdrawal was noticed.
Patrols sent out by this battalion, which at the time
happened to be in the line, returned and reported, “ No
signs of enemy—appears to have evacuated the front
line.”
On the 25th February the battalion, moving forward
in extended order, attacked and occupied Le Barque
Switch.
It was not at all an unopposed advance, however.
Fritz had left behind many surprises in the shape of cleverly
concealed strong posts, which often did not fire until the
men had passed, taking them in rear and causing many
casualties before they could be silenced.
Three days after congratulations were received from
the Army Corps and Divisional Commanders for the
excellent work done at Le Barque.
The retirement undoubtedly upset slightly the plans
for the Spring, but these were not forgotten.
In the meantime the whole of March was spent in the
vicinity of Shelter Wood and Bresle in training, com-
petitions and salvaging.
April 4th saw the battalion again on its way forward

Wounded on Menin Road, Sept. 20th, 1917


passing through Montauban and Fremicourt on the 4th
and sth, and into the Front line on the 7th.
Next morning (Bth) the line was advanced 1,000 yards,
with casualties to 4 officers and 4° other ranks.
On the 9th the line was again advanced, with casualties
to 1 officer and 40 other ranks, and the next day at 02.00,
with the assistance of “ C” Company of nth Battalion,
the line was pushed well forward of Boursi.es with prac-
tically no opposition.
On the evening of the nth the nth Battalion relieved
the 10th, and the next three days were spent in support.
By this time the enemy, probably being pressed rather
more closely than he liked, delivered a strong counter-
attack at 04.20 (on the 15th), and “A” and “ B ” Com-
panies were sent to support the nth and 12th Battalions
respectively, and in the evening the battalion took over
part of the nth Battalion line with “ A,” “ C ” and “ D ”
in line and “ B ” in reserve.
The relief from the line was carried out on the follow-
ing night (16-17) by the 7th Battalion, and for the rest of
the month of April till the 4th of May the battalion spent
in rest at Bancourt on fatigue and training.
Now that the high ground of his new defence position
had been reached, the enemy opposition, which had been
stiffening, became exceedingly firm.
He was now occupying the position which he in-
tended to hold.
We know now something of what the ‘ ‘ Hindcnburg
Line ” really was. In the light of after events, when attacks
were made on 30, s°> an d 80-mile fronts, and in many
places at one time, calculating to draw enemy reserves
in several places so that nowhere the line could be held
in strength, we can see what an undertaking it was to
attempt to storm such a position, fortified by every sort
of wire entanglement imaginable, backed by an artillery
not much, if at all, inferior to our own, with an observa-
tion on the enemy who had little or none on him, with
an interior system of railways and roads which enabled
him to throw an army into any weak spot in practically
half the time it took us, advancing as we were over newly
evacuated country.
And yet, despite the difficulty, the apparent im-
possibility, the thing was done. On the 4th, the battalion,
as part of the attacking force in support of the 9th Bat-
D


talion, moved up into the forward area, and by 03.30
on the sth, were in position.
The enemy shelling was heavy and accurate. “C ”
company was placed at the disposal of the 12th, who
were hard pressed, “ B ” and “ D ” went into the line
and retook by counter-attack the ground taken by the
enemy. The fighting was desperate, the bombardment
terrific, the enemy delivered counter-attack after counter-
attack, but the line now re-established held through all.
In 10 days no less than twelve counter-attacks of tre-
mendous force were delivered against the Australians in
that sector.
It was Pozieres again on a grander scale, against even
greater odds and against a far more formidable position,
and though a little ground dear to the heart of the enemy
was taken, yet a break through had not been achieved.
After a winter spent mainly in the line, and having
delivered in the early spring three attacks in three months,
the battalion with the division went out for a well-earned
rest, and nearly four months had elapsed before they were
again called upon to pass in front of the balloons.
During this time the battalion won the Brigade Cup
(30th May) with 17 points, the 12th being next with 11,
and in June “D ” Company, under Captain Cornish,
was placed second in the division in the Company
Competition.
On the 12th of June the battalion marched to Henen-
court, where it bivouacked for the Divisional Sports,
returning to Ribcmont on the 14th. Col. Jacobs having
gone to England to the Overseas Training Battalion, Col.
Neligan assumed command.
Much time for the next few weeks was spent in advanced
training in the areas of Mailly Maillet and Bray. Practice
in advance and rearguards, outposts, night marches,
deployment in attack, trench to trench attacks with live
ammunition brought the battalion to a high state of
efficiency.
On July 26th, entraining at Albert, the battalion set
out for the north.
Here the battalion spent another very happy two
months, and every week expected to be called upon to
go forward, but the call came not, and July passed into
August, and the battalion was still enjoying the benefits
of the spell.

Constant reinforcements and little wastage by casual-
ties soon brought the battalion nearer to full strength
than it had been for many a day.
Training was constant, and the weather good, tic
people hospitable, and the war very far away.
Two raiding parties 150 and 100 strong, under Captains
Campbell, M.C., and Hurcombe, were trained here.
The raiders rose early, and after a brisk walk or double
bathed every morning, “Y” in baths close by, X in
a canal not far from their billets.
The men were in perfect condition after so long a
spell with such fine training, and the war was almost
forgotten.
But, like all good times, this had to come to an end.
Early in September it became known that an attack
was to be made on the Passchendaele Ridge with a view
to gaining the high ground dominating Ypres both for
comfort and safety during the winter, and to make a
good basis for the spring operations.
The sector allotted to the battalion was that m the
vicinity of Nonne Boschen and Polygon Wood, and
opportunities were made for most of the officers concerned
to see the actual ground or else the relief maps which
had been constructed for instructional purposes.
On the 13th (after having won the Brigade Drill Cup)
the battalion left this when next they saw
it, some seven months later, was in the hands of the
Boche —and worked its way forward by short stages via
Caestre, Connaught Lines, Cornwall Camp, and finally
Chateau Segard, at which place the final prepaiations
were made. It was a very busy time indeed.
The cooks were busy night and day cooking and pre-
paring food, and when the men left the camp they carried
with them enough food for 48 hours, including sandwiches
and chocolate.
Nothing was forgotten, everything was provided for ;
all that organisation could do had been done—it now
remained for the men to do the rest.
Messages had been received from the Divisional and
Brigade Commanders urging the men to remember and
uphold the traditions which they themselves had made.
Late on the night of the 19th —20th, at 23.30, after
having had a hot meal, and in rain that was, to say the
least of it, not cheering, the battalion left Chateau Scgaid,

and at 3 A.m. reached the assembly tape, and formed up
into position.
At this time came an event which put to the test the
training and the men. Either from accident or design
the enemy dropped a barrage right along the ground on
which the men were assembled, causing for a time many
casualties and slight disorganisation.
However, by the splendid work of the officers and
men order was restored, and at 5.40, zero hour, the men
went forward under as perfect a barrage as they had
yet seen.
So opened for us the Third Battle of Ypres, one of the
most terrific battles in the history of the war. The con-
centration of artillery on both sides was without parallel
—the ground, a mass of shell holes and craters from
battles that had been waged around this historic spot,
was again retorn and rechurned.
This small salient, which had cost both sides more
lives than either cared to remember, was to exact a yet
further toll ere the struggle was over.
In the advance, the nth and 12th Battalions, who
were to take the Ist and 2nd objectives, met strong oppo-
sition at Glencourse Wood, but despite this the 2nd
objective was reached, and here, while the barrage rested
on the 3rd objective, the battalion reorganised into its
previous formation ready for the final attack.
This was no small task. The noise was deafening,
casualties constantly occurring, men of all battalions
hopelessly mixed had to be resorted and re-organised,
but-by. the extraordinary abilities of Captains Campbell,
Hurcombe and Cornish, and the other officers, the work
of- ; organisation was completed, and while the men waited
for the barrage to lift they filled in their time by reading
papers and eating what they needed of their sandwiches .
On the barrage lifting, “ X ” and “ Y ” Companies
moved forward, and established themselves in the 3rd
objectives.
Had the troops been available much more ground
could have been taken, and what would have happened
would have been interesting to know.
In the afternoon and evening the enemy delivered
counter-attacks, but the quick response and accurate
shooting mf our artillery, together with that of our own
men from their good position, beat the enemy back, and

neither on the first or second day did he reach our front
line.
In this action 506, Pte. Inwood, did the magnificent
work for which he was awarded the V.C. On the 20th
“ He moved forward through our barrage alone to an
enemy strong post, and captured it together with nine
prisoners, killing several of the enemy. In the early
morning of September 21st, Pte. Inwood located a machine-
gun which was causing several casualties. He went out
alone and bombed the gun and team, killing all but one,
whom he brought in as prisoner, with the gun."
After a week’s spell in the Steenvoorde area the
battalion was back again, not to attack this time, but
to hold the line, while the Ist Brigade passed through.
On the 4th October, under a barrage which carried all
before it, the Ist Brigade advanced, and by midday the
prisoners had mounted to thousands.
And now came the worst part of all, our men, relieving
the attacking brigade, had to face the counter-attacks
of the enemy in weather and country much resembling
Gucudecourt.
On the whole front there were but two or three main
roads over which it was possible to take traffic, and these
the enemy knew as well as we, and night and day he
shelled them with shrapnel and H.E. Off the roads
traffic was impossible. Corduroy tracks were laid by the
engineers, and as far as possible kept in repair, but as
often as not they were blown up as fast as they were
made.
Blocks in the traffic were inevitable and constant.
At times as far as the eye could see the main arteries of
communication would be blocked, while the enemy rained
his iron hail on to the living target which he could hardly
miss.
Whole teams of wagons were killed, to be dragged out
of the way and the vehicle pushed into the mud, to allow
the living to pass.
Horses, dead and mangled, lay many to the yard in
places along a track of three or four miles, and guns,
wagons, limbers and ambulances by the hundred were
to be found in a more or less whole condition along the
track.
Before leaving this period there is one incident worthy
of mention. To gain information, to create a diversion

and draw fire, and to deceive the enemy into thinking the
attack was to be made at one point, Celtic Wood, while
the real attack was to be made at another, a raiding party
consisting of five officers and 80 other ranks was quickly
organised. The date fixed was the morning of the 10th.
At 05.20, after a few rounds of 18-poundcrs, these men
went over the top and made foi Celtic Wood.
Supported by trench mortars they worked through
the wood, and, despite a withering fire from many machine
guns, attacked the enemy trenches, where they put up
a magnificent fight ; but, when everything seemed going
well, and retirement was being made, the enemy, now
thoroughly roused, poured in a terrific and accurate fire.
A few managed to get back, but that was the last that
was seen or heard of the majority of the men. Of the
five officers, the 0.C., Lieut. F. Scott, and another officer
were killed, one was missing, the other two wounded.
About 19 other ranks returned.
One good effect, however, the raid had. The enemy
were deceived into thinking that a great attack was to
be delivered at this point and sent troops and a barrage
on to this spot, while the attack was made elsewhere.
The men, far from being depressed by the raid, seeing
what a grand fight had been put up against such im-
possible conditions and overwhelming odds were filled
with a great admiration for the men who had fought so
well So the fighting wore on through October and
November, the high ground by this time had been prac-
tically all won, but nothing in the shape of a break through
had been obtained.
The ridge was ours, but at what a cost. In twen y
days in the forward area this battalion alone had lost
nearly 500 men. , ,
However, though they knew it not, this was the last
great battle of the kind they were to fight.
Never again were the troops of either side to be massed
on so small a front for an attack, nor was the mode of
attack the same.
It had been found that it was practically impossible
for either side with such a concentration of men and
artillery to obtain a break through.
The method of pounding the enemy’s communications
to powder defeated its own ends, roads over which the
enemy could not retire were useless to us m advance,

and, no matter how good a modern army may be, it is
impossible for it to go on for long without its transport.
That was the last glimpse the battalion had of that
sector, nor were they sorry to leave it. Later on the
battalion occupied sectors some distance further South,
but never returned to that spot.
After this the whole division spent the best part of
a month in the Boulogne area, and, with the rest and change,
with much keen rivalry in sport, the battalion was soon
itself again.
As usual all sorts of rumours were afloat—“ No more
line work till the Spring,’' “ South of France,” but on
the 13th the battalion was again on the move East, and
on the 16th relieved the 31st battalion in the line at
Mcssines.
In this area (though not always the same sector) the
battalion remained until the beginning of April—some-
times out, but more often in the forward zone—and,
though the sector was a quiet one, the fatigues which
were long and tiring gave little rest for either officers or
men.
On Christmas morning (25th December) the battalion
was relieved in the line by the 12th, and the men, trudging
wearily back into their dugouts and shelters at Wulver-
ghem, were glad to pass their Christmas day in rest and
sleep.
January passed away in this area, though during the
month the battalion was transferred to another sector
Wytschaete, which was very quiet and even better than
the last.
On January 31st the battalion proceeded to Aider-
shot camp, reaching it in the early hours in the morning,
chilled to the bone by an ice-cold journey in open trucks,
but not too cold to make caustic remarks about the engine
driver and the military in general.
At this camp, though the fatigues were still fairly
constant, the battalion enjoyed a month’s spell, and
boxing and football were organised. Cinemas, dinners,
and concerts were frequent, and on the 16th February
the Battalion celebrated its Christmas day, which it had
been unable to do before on account of being in the forward
area. Prizes were given for the best decorated huts,
and keen was the competition.
Men sat up practically all night in order that their

blankets could be sewn together and used as decorations,
and the huts looked more like draped shop-windows than
living apartments of the “ Diggers.”
For a short time they became boys again, and the
parcels which were distributed were opened with as much
zest as they would have been ten years previously.
Sports in the afternoon completed a very happy day.
Here the football team won the 3rd Brigade Cup, and
bade fair to bring off the Divisional Competition, but was
beaten in one match by the Bth battalion, which was
successful right through.
On the night ist—2nd March the battalion, leaving
Tournai Camp, went into the line in Hollebeke sector, and
remained in the forward area until relieved at the beginning
of April.
It was about this time that the enemy —known to be
holding huge reserves of troops, released from the Russian
front —was, at any moment, at almost any place, ex-
pected to attack. “ Stand to’s ” were the order of the
day.
The first night, just as the relief was taking place, a
raid, estimated at about three officers, 129 other ranks,
was made by the enemy on our front.
The time was awkward, but by the excellent work
of Lieut. C. Scott (for which he was afterwards awarded
the M.C.) and the support platoons, the attack was beaten
off with heavy casualties, but not before they had reached
“ D ” Company’s Headquarters, capturing and carrying
off Major Henwood, the Company commander, who was
killed on his way over No Man’s Land.
Seven other ranks were missing but no information of
importance was obtained. All maps and important
documents were afterwards found under the bed in the
dugout.
It was at this time, too, that the back areas, camps
and transport lines were constantly and consistently
shelled, and many horses and men were killed and wounded.
Events were certainly pointing to an offensive by the
enemy, but the points of attack were doubtful.
The doubt, however, did not last for long. On March
21st the enemy attacked on an unparalleled scale, with
something like 40 divisions on a 50-mile front on the
Somme, and by the 27th had reached Albert, having
captured some 50,000 prisoners and 600 guns. (Ground

which had taken months of heavy fighting and hundreds
of thousands of lives gone within a week). Near Albert,
however, he was met by some of the Australian divisions,
rushed down to fill a gap that had become serious, and
was likely to turn the tide of the whole war.
What they did is now a matter of history —by a wonder-
ful stand against overwhelming odds they held their ground
not far from Albert despite strong and repeated counter-
attacks, thus saving Amiens.
In the meantime, the battalion, as soon as the division
could be relieved by broken units from the Somme, was
also hurried south, to the assistance of the other divisions,
if need be, and by the 6th of April was in reserve in the
Poulanville area.
But now, the worst being over, the advance held,
and the enemy still with many reserve divisions untouched,
the question arose as to where the next blow would be
delivered. Whether the enemy knew of the Australian
relief from Belgium and the holding of the line there by
the badly disabled battalions from the Somme or not,
here it was he launched his second great offensive.
Within a week from the time it had left the North
the ist Division was back again—detrained at Honde-
ghem (near Caestre) late at night, and held a hurried
conference at which information was obtained that the
enemy had bent back the front line, and was somewhere
in the vicinity of Vieux Berquin, marching on Haze-
brouck.
The night was black, and maps few, and guides not
to be had. Guns seemed to be firing from every direction.
All superfluous gear was dropped, and the battalion
marched away in silence and perfect order to support
the ? s t Tfd 2nd Brigades near Borre—they were going
to something they knew not what—but something outside
the usual routine of trench warfare, and were pleased at
the change.
They dug in in rear of the Dieppe forest—but were
never called upon to defend these positions.
The advance here, as on the Somme had been held,
and the enemy was baulked of the fruits of his victory,
obtaining neither a break through to the coast nor even
a break through our line.
The front now roughly was Kemmel, Dranoutre,
Bailleul, Mcteren, Strazeele, Vieux Berquin, and Merville,


Places which less than a week ago had been back
areas, in which several times the battalion had been
billeted during rests, were now in the process of being
pounded and mutilated out of all recognition. The Belgian
and French inhabitants, with the exception of one or
two who could not bring themselves to leave, had left
long ere this, carrying with them what they could. It
was a piteous sight to see whole families stranded on the
roadside with little or nothing to eat and without the
means of getting it, with no place to which they could
turn for shelter, and their homes and farms, the work
of a lifetime, being slowly but surely wiped off the
map.
Much of their livestock was collected and sent back
to the rear, but much that couldn’t be removed was used
by the troops.
The smell of some roast, neither bully nor frozen meat,
often assailed the nostrils of the passer-by at this time.
At one time while in the forward area, two “ Diggers,”
evidently carrying a wounded comrade to the aid post,
were stopped by an officer desiring to know the
and nature of the casualty. To satisfy his thirst for
knowledge he pulled back the covering disclosing the
head of a huge pig. However, the funeral cortege was
allowed to proceed without molestation to the cookhouse,
where to the accompaniment of several pianos from
neighbouring barns, it was duly roasted.
On the night 24th —25th, being in the trenches in
front of Meteren, the battalion attempted, in conjunction
with the 9th on the right, to take this town from the
enemy by an outflanking movement. The attack, how-
ever, unsupported by artillery fire, and following on one
made the previous night, was expected, and though the
line was advanced, the town remained in the hands of
the enemy, and our casualties were heavy.
The next three months the battalion was in much the
same area but on sectors more to the right near Strazeele
and Merris, and by constant attacks snatched position
after position of strategical importance from the enemy,
and so wore him down that he had constantly to put in
fresh divisions and change his plans.
Here the 3rd and last V.C. of the battalion was won.
“ During a minor operation Cpl. Philip Davey, to silence
a machine-gun that was causing heavy casualties, moved

forward alone in the face of a fierce point-blank fire, and
attacked the gun with hand grenades, putting half the
crew out of action.
“ Having used all available grenades, he returned to
the original ‘ jumping off ’ trench, secured a further supply
and again attacked the gun, the crew of which in the
meantime had been reinforced. He killed the crew,
eight in all, and captured the gun, then mounted the
gun in the new position, and used it to repel a very deter-
mined counter-attack, during which he was severely
wounded.”
The constant fighting, however, cost the battalion
some of its finest officers and men. Lieuts. Hill, Corcoran,
Scott, Mclnerney, among others, paid with their lives for
the victories gained.
At the same time, besides acting on the offensive,
the division had to be prepared at any time for the next
blow by the enemy, who was still strong enough to warrant
the taking of every precaution against attack. Several
periods of “ wind-up ” were passed through, but this
time the blow fell not on the British, but on the French,
who were finally driven back till Paris itself was threat-
ened.
In the meantime preparations were proceeding for
the capture of Merris, and on the night of 29th —30th
of July, by a beautifully neat piece of work, Merris was
captured with 187 prisoners, by two companies, “ A ”
and “ B,” at the cost in the actual operation itself of
about three casualties.
During these operations hot meals, two per night,
were delivered to the front line company headquarters
by pack, and during one period of ten days in the line
the labour of 800 men was saved in hot meals alone, in
addition to the ammunition carried forward.
Congratulations flowed in from all sides on the suc-
cessful issue of these operations, the Divisional, Corps
and Army Commanders coming in person to see for
themselves the work done. Before, however, the bat-
talion had time to recover from its last venture it
was whirled back by bus to Henrighem, a village in the
vicinity of St. Omer, and hopes began to rise at the pros-
pect of what seemed a good spell coming.
For six days the battalion remained in this area, but
on the 6th of July entrained at Wizernes for the south


to join the Australian Corps from which the ist Division
had been absent for some months.
Detraining at Port Rimy about 5.30 a.m. on the 7th
and proceeding by route march and bus, the battalion,
worked its way forward, arriving at the “ Village of the
Fires ” (Poulanville) early in the morning of the Bth.
Rumour began to get abroad about great attacks,
and before the village was left that day large batches of
enemy prisoners passed through. It was the famous Bth
of August battle —the British Armies, including the Aus-
tralian and Canadian Corps, had attacked that morning
early, on a wide front, and by evening had advanced
many miles.
The battalion spent the two days (Bth and 9th) trying
to keep up with the advancing troops, passing Corbie,
Warfusee-Abancourt, Bayonvillers, Guillaucourt.
On the evening of the 9th, the battalion, having settled
down several times previously, only to receive orders to
move on and occupy a fresh position —spent the night
in hastily dug shelters just south of Harbonnieres.
At 6.30 a.m. the advance started again in artillery
formation, the battalion supporting the 9th Battalion.
Opposition was met near “ Crepey Wood/' and the
9th Battalion having swung out of true direction, “ A ”
Company, under Captain McCann, was sent to clear it up.
Under a heavy fire, and losing many men, the wood
was cleared, and four posts were established on the out-
skirts of the wood.
At 4 o’clock in the afternoon after a heavy bom-
bardment during which two out of the four posts were
completely blown out- the enemy delivered a strong
counter attack against the remnants of the company, but
the wood was not to be theirs. With one officer and
7 other ranks, Captain McCann, putting up a magnificent
fight, held back the enemy, and when at the end of an
hour they retired, they left 90 of their dead behind. For
this Captain McCann, recommended for the highest decora-
tion, received his D.S.O.
The next day, early in the morning, two companies
of the 10th in conjunction with the 12th Battalion, after
a fierce fight, took and passed through Lihons, and, despite
a counter-attack on a flank in the air which was discovered
just in time to prevent disaster, held on to the ground,
causing many casualties and taking many prisoners.

Hun Prisoners taken on the Somme


After a spell of five days at Vaire on the Somme-
spent in resting, bathing, sports and reorganisation, and
despite the fact that the men had been fighting continu-
ously for nearly five months, the battalion moved forward
ready for the attack of the 23rd at Proyart.
Though not intended to be in the initial stages of the
attack, the battalion had to send one company (“ A ”)
to make good the flank which the loss of direction on the
part of the attacking units had left untouched. In
addition to this, before the operation was finished, the
battalion had advanced nearly 6,000 yards, and taken
many woods and the high ground near Gappy, together
with many prisoners.
Less than a month had elapsed when the battalion,
after a hot meal, left Jeancourt just before 07.00 on the
18th of September. They passed through the 12th at
the first objective, retaining perfect formation (except in
one or two cases where it was necessary to deploy to
overcome some opposition), and, by 1 o’clock in the after-
noon, had advanced 5,000 yards on a 1,000-yard front,
and had consolidated its gains, and, before the line was
vacated a few days later, had pushed the line right into
the heart of the outposts of the Hindenburg system.
It was typical that this, their last operation in the
war, should be an attack, and one as important as it was
successful. Like the other operations of the last five
months it was neither an accident nor a fluke. It was
the outcome of months of the most careful organisation
and attention to detail. The men were lectured by com-
panies, and, where possible, by platoons —their difficulties
solved, suggestions listened to, and explanations rendered
where possible—giving rise to a feeling of trust and con-
fidence in themselves and their leaders whom the men
were ready to and did follow anywhere they were asked
to go.
All of them, officers, non-commissioned-officers and
men had lost relatives and friends, old and intimate, but
realised that “The game is more than the flayer of the
game,” and that it was for those who remained to carry
on where the others had left off, and ready always if
necessary to give their lives too in the cause of the bat-
talion for Australia and for the Empire.
1 owards the close of this last operation the remainder
of the men, some 30 in number, who came away in 1914,

left for Australia. It is a curious and fitting fact that
before they left they had seen the last operation of the
battalion in the war.
The next few weeks, till the end, our role in the great
offensive was a minor one.
It had at last been found possible to give the Aus-
tralian corps a much-needed and well-earned rest, but
before the last came out they had, in conjunction with
the American Army, attacked and breached the Hinden-
burg line itself. The turn of the tables since March 21st
was almost complete. The end was in sight, and while
the battalion was at Brucamps (near Abbeville) resting,
and training in sport and matters military, the final
scenes of the four years’ drama were being enacted.
The sideshows much criticised, not understood and
often roundly condemned, began to bear fruit. Bulgaria,
pressed until she could withstand no longer, was the first
to succumb —Turkey, with its Army practically wiped
out of existence by the brilliant work of General Allenby
in Palestine, was the next to follow.
Austria, threatened with invasion, from the south,
driven back by the Italians from territory she had occupied
since the beginning of the war beaten, routed, utterly
demoralised, was the next to throw up her hands, leaving
Germany alone.
Realising that her hour had come —knowing that
the time could be counted in hours, when the foes which
she had hated, despised and underestimated would be
on her own soil, and overhead making her beautiful cities
into the hell she herself had made of France, Belgium,
and Serbia, she asked for an armistice.
The armistice was presented —terms, unconditional
surrender. The battalion with the Corps moving forward
in anticipation of a refusal, was relieved to find that the
armistice had been signed. The curtain had been dropped.
With the feeling of relief, however, was mingled one
of disappointment and disgust. Disappointment that
Germany could not now be made to feel and suffer some-
thing of the pain and misery she had inflicted upon France,
Belgium, Serbia, and Roumania.
Disgust at the realisation that she would not stand
and take the beating that was due to her, but at the first
serious menace to herself, even before the Allies had set
foot on her territory, had hoisted the white flag.

The whole Central edifice, built upon the uncertain
foundations of corruption, lies, greed and distrust, collapsed
at the first serious breath of ill-fortune, and, collapsing,
the central columns were the worst damaged.
So the Allies, fighting for the cause of liberty and
humanity, after a titanic struggle, which at times threat-
ened their very existence, paying with their best blood,
one in defeat and triumph, have emerged victorious.
Britain of history, Britain still greater. Australia,
one of the youngest of her colonies, comes out of the war
with a name which any country might be proud to
possess.
So the battalion, from the first moment when it assailed
the vaunted impregnable heights of Gabc Tepe, until
near Bcllicourt it drove its assault into the very heart
of the Hindenburg system (afterwards to be broken by
our own men) has never looked back.
Perhaps the spirits of the men who fell at the Darda-
nelles, and those who followed later in France and Belgium,
jealous for the cause for which they gave their lives,
keeping constant patrol, have inspired the men who
survived to carry on the work which had been so well
begun.
