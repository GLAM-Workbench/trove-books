THE COLONY OF VICTORIA,
AUSTRALIA.
The geographical position of Williamstown, which is the
starting point for the geodetic survey of the Colony, is in
latitude 37° 52' 42" south, and in longitude 9 hrs 37 m 54 sec east:
of Greenwich. The Flagstaff Observatory at Melbourne is
situated about 4 miles north and 30° east from this standard
point, on an elevation above the level of the sea equal to
120 feet.
The area of Victoria is 86,831 square miles, or 55,571,840
acres, which is about the size of England, Scotland, and Wales
united. The land sold up to the year 1860 was 3,933,844
acres; and that under cultivation in 1861 amounted to 419,592
acres.
Population-
In the year 1836, the census of Port Phillip, now called
Victoria, gave the following returns 142 ; females,
35 ; total, 177. At that time, and up to the year 1851, Port
Phillip was a Province of New South Wales. The population
of the latter in 1836 was 77,096. In 1851, Victoria was
separated from the Government of New South Wales, and


started as an independent Colony, with 77,345 inhabitants.
The population of the adjoining and parent Colony was at that
time 197,168 persons, or 119,823 more than Victoria.
Since the year 1851, the increase of population in Victoria
has been unprecedented in the annals of British Colonies. In
1861, the census enumeration gave the following numbers:—
Males, 328,651; females, 211,671; total, 540,322 persons, or
189,462 more than New' South Wales. In 1861, the popula-
tion of the Australian Colonies was enumerated as follows:

The comparative rate per cent, of births, marriages, and
deaths, in Victoria and England from 1854 to 1860 is as
follows: —
Births. Marriages. Deaths.
Victoria. 1 England. Victoria. I England. Victoria. 1 England.
3,834 I 3,406 1,031 ! 826 1,941 ! 2,229
It will thus be seen that there are more births and marriages,
and fewer deaths in proportion, in Victoria than in England.
There are about 4,000 Volunteers in the Colony, comprising
Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers, and Riflemen, who are all in a
highly efficient state of drill.

Statistics.
The Post-Office revenues for the past year (1861) amounted
to 127,869/., and the expenditure to 109,479/. In the convey-
ance of the inland mails the number of miles travelled was
1,511,381. The number of post-offices in Victoria is 365 ;
5,166,149 letters, and 2,818,761 newspapers were posted in the
course of the year. 1,762,566 letters, and 2,086,979 newspapers
received and despatched by ship during the above time.
There are 884 places of public worship, with accommodation
for 150,000 persons. There are 665 public schools, having
46,687 scholars, and receiving Government aid to the amount of
110,155/. per annum. There are 221 private schools, with
4,981 scholars.
The Melbourne University has 104 students, and confers
degrees, which, by the pleasure of Her Majesty, are equal in
rank and consideration with the universities of Great Britain.
The Public Library contains 30,000 volumes, and is attended
on an average by 485 readers daily. The Museum of Arts,
recently opened, has been visited on an average by 200
persons daily.
The number of hospitals, benevolent institutions, and asy-
lums (there are no workhouses) in Victoria is thirty, receiving
Government aid to the amount of 90,894/., and private contribu-
tions amounting to 53,718/. per annum.
In 1860 there were ten savings banks, having 11,349 depo-
sitors, with a total balance of 540,622/.; equal to an average of
47/. 12s. 9 d. per head.
The climate of Victoria is most genial, closely resembling
that of Italy. The mean temperature of the air, according to
observations extending over a number of years, is 57° 6'. The
beautiful clearness of the sky is faithfully depicted in the paint-
ings of Australian scenery which are exhibited in the Victoria


Department. The purity of the air exercises a strong influence
on the habits and temperament of the inhabitants, who certainly
appear more cheerful, buoyant, and happy, than those who
dwell in colder latitudes.
The most delicate flowers, which in England require to be
nurtured in conservatories, grow luxuriantly in the open air in
Victoria.
Models of some of the fruits and vegetables can be seen in
the Victorian Court, which speak for themselves.
i4 r~ '
Agriculture.
Particular attention is directed to the sample's of Wheat,
oats, barley, and flour, which for quality and weight per bushel
are generally admitted to be the best in the Exhibition.
Tuscan wheat, 69 lbs., Tartarian oats, 49 lbs. 40z., and barley,
58 lbs. 5 oz. per bushel, are here exhibited. Twenty-five prize
medals and twenty Honourable Mentions have been awarded to
Victorian grain,—the largest number given to any British
ao * Tf T AOII gimutro oxnuodloM m nnrl gaienq
Vineyards. —About 2,000 acres of vineyard are already
planted and in a thriving condition. New ground is being
daily prepared for vine cultivation, so that no doubt exists of
this important branch of husbandry extending over a large
portion of Victoria. Hitherto most of the vignerons have
pressed their grapes; but in order to facilitate the manufacture
of wine on a larger scale, and in a more scientific manner,
companies have been formed to purchase grapes from the small
yine-growers, and to assort them with proper care and skill, so
as to preserve the characteristic flavour of the different kinds
of grape. The price at present paid for grapes by these com-
panies is 2 \d. per pound, which leaves a handsome profit to
the grower. Vine-cuttings come into full bearing at three
years old. wq ~j \ t y : j.„


Wine. — Samples of wine from different vineyards are ex-
hibited, some of Avhich have been highly commended.
Cotton. —Many parts of the colony are well adapted for the
growth of cotton, and steps have been already taken by some
of the colonists to introduce this important branch of cultiva-
tion. On the Charlotte Plains, Mr. Yuille has sown a quantity
of seed, and is preparing to place 100 acres under crop next
year.
Flax can be grown in most parts of the colony. A sample
from the Botanical Gardens is exhibited in the collection of
fibres. It is now being cultivated at Warnambool.
Silk. —Attention is being directed to the rearing of the
silk-worm, which is found to thrive exceedingly well both on
the black and white mulberry.
Arrow-Root. —Samples of arrow-root are exhibited from
various parts of the colony. The plant thrives well, and can
be easily and profitably cultivated.
Tobacco. —The cultivation of the tobacco plant is now being
carried on in many parts of the colony, a considerable impetus
having been given to this branch of agriculture by an enter-
prising firm in Melbourne offering 110/. per ton for all leaf
tobacco supplied to them.
The olive, orange, lemon, pine-apple, and other tropical
fruits are now being cultivated with great success.
Emigration.
That Victoria offers greater attractions for settlement than
almost any other part of the civilized globe may be inferred from
the following Table of the retail price of provisions, taken from
the newspapers received by the last (May) mail, at which time
it was reported trade was better than had been known for a
long time past: —
Beef, per 1b... .. .. .. 2d. to 4 \d.

Milk, per quart .. .. .. 6d.
Potatoes, per cwt. .. .. -.. ss. 6d. to 6s.
Bent of a four-roomed cottage is from ss. to 10s. per week.
Taking one thing with another, the cost of living is much
cheaper in Victoria than in England.
The Parliament of Victoria has voted the following for the
promotion of emigration during the present year: —
1. Towards defraying the expense of introducing from the
United Kingdom persons nominated by friends or relatives in
the colony, the sum of 65,000/. has been voted.
2. For sending out single females and persons nominated in
the United Kingdom, the sum of 40,000/. has been voted.
3. For the introduction from Italy, Spain, and the South
of France, of persons, with their families, who are skilled in the
production of wine or oil, and in the drying and preservation of
fruit, the sum of 8,000/. has been voted.
With regard to the mode of obtaining a passage to the
colony under the above votes, the following regulations are
made. Persons nominated in Victoria under the first clause
must be paid for by their friends in the colony at the following
rates :—Males under twelve years of age, 4/.; twelve and under
forty, 8/.; forty and upwards, 9/.; females under twelve, SI.;
twelve and under forty, 4/.; forty and upwards, 51.
Under the second clause, free passage warrants will be
Issued until the 31st October, for natives of England, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales, in proportion to the number of persons
resident in Victoria, from those countries respectively.
There are ten million acres of good agricultural land now
surveyed and ready for settlement, in allotments from 40 to


320 acres, at one pound per acre. At the same time he can
lease a similar area to that purchased, at half-a-crown per acre,
and when this rent has been paid for eight years he obtains the
freehold of the land.
Labour.
The following prices are now being paid for labour in
Victoria. The rates are certainly much lower than formerly,
but on the other side it is to be remembered that the cost of
living, rent, and clothing are all proportionately cheaper :
Carpenters, bricklayers, and plasterers, Bs. to 10s. per day
of 8 hours; masons and smiths, 10s. to 12s.'; pick and shovel
men, 7s. to Bs.; ploughmen, 20s. per week, with board and
lodging ; farm labourers, 15s. per week, with board and lodging;
married couples without families, 60/. per annum, with board
and lodging; gardeners, 40/. to 50/. a-year, with ditto; men
cooks for farms and stations, 20s. to 255. per week; shepherds,
30/, a-year; cooks for hotels, 30s. to 21. per week; female
cooks, 35. to 50/. a-year; housemaids, 30/. a-year; good
general servants, 30/. to 35/. a-year. Where rations are given
on stations and farms the supply per week is as follows :
16 lbs. of flour, 10 lbs. of beef or mutton, 2 lbs. of sugar, £ lb.
of tea per week.
Mineral Products.
Qold. —The quantity of gold exported from Victoria be-
tween October Ist, 1851, and October Ist, 1861, amounted to
26,162,432 ounces troy, equal to 800 tons 17 cwt. 3 qrs. 7 lbs.,
the value of which is 104,649,728/. sterling. The pyramid
which stands under the eastern dome was designed by Mr.
Knight, F.1.8.A., to show the comparatively small space which
such a quantity of gold would occupy. The measurement of
the figure is only 1,492| cubic feet, yet the value thereby
represented is one eighth of the national debt of Great Britain.


Since the pyramid was designed the gold fields of Victoria
have yielded a further quantity of 35 tons 10 cwt. 2 qrs. Gibs.,
the value of which is 4,642,328 1, sterling. This is computed to
the 19th April, 1862. Since this latter date another return
has been received to the 12th of May, which gives an additional
quantity of 138,003 ounces, value 552,012 1. Models of the
principal “ nuggets,” or lumps of gold, which have been found
in Victoria, are shown in low relief, on the lower portion of the
pyramid. The pyramid is 44 ft. in. high, and 10 ft. square
at its base.
Silver. —Silver is found in considerable quantities in the
quartz reefs at St. Arnaud’s and other places.
Tin Ore. —Black sand, containing a large percentage of tin,
is abundant in the Oven’s district, Taradale, Strathbogle, &c.
Antimony. Antimony containing gold is found in large
quantities at Heathcotc ; —a block of antimony weighing half a
ton stands at the foot of the pyramid.
Iron. —lron ore is plentiful; thousands of tons of rich ore
are lying upon the surface of the ground at Sandhurst. Speci-
mens of the ore are exhibited in the department.
Kaolin. —Fine beds of Kaolin are to be met with in various
parts of the colony—a sample block from Bulla is exhibited.
The clay from this place is now being manufactured into different
articles by a Melbourne company.
The Pjress.
The condition of the Press usually affords a good standard
by which the social condition of a country can be guaged. In
the colony of Victoria the number of periodical publications is
upwards of one hundred. Copies of nearly all these are to be
seen in the Exhibition. In Melbourne alone, of newspapers
and periodicals there are three daily, thirty-three weekly, ten
fortnightly, ten monthly, one quarterly, and one yearly.
A striking proof of the extraordinary progress of Victoria is
given in a statement appended to a volume of the Ballarat Star,


which was first published as a tri-weekly paper in September,
1855, and as a daily journal in December, 1856.
“ When the Great Exhibition of 1851 was opened, the only
habitation on the site of the present town of Ballarat was a
shepherd’s hut, built of slabs of wood, and roofed with bark. In a
circle, having Ballarat as a centre, with a radius of 40 miles, the
population then did not exceed 500 persons, and consisted of a few
sheep-farmers and their dependents. The population of the same
area, when the census was taken in 1861, was 105,996 persons. At
the same date the population of the town of Ballarat was 22,111
persons. At the present time (December, 1861) in the district
around the town of Ballarat, there are published four bi-weekly
newspapers, and in the town of Ballarat one weekly and two daily
newspapers.”
