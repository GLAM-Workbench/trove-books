PREFACE.
In entering upon the compilation of the following pages, I
am encouraged by the belief that the information of which I
-am in possession, and am about to detail, regarding parti-
cularly an interesting portion of an interesting colony, will
render any apology for intruding myself as an author, unne-
cessary.
However numerous the works on New South Wales, it must
appear to the attentive observer, that upon the important
subjects of emigration and receiving of lands from the Crown,
by grant, there is yet a great want of useful information.
This deficiency then I hope to supply; as it is my intention
to devote the following pages almost wholly to the above-
mentioned subjects.
Having been employed as an Assistant Surveyor in the
Hunter’s river division of the colony, since the year 1822,
I had long contemplated, when my surveys in that district
should have extended over more space than it now really
does, the publication of a Map of the same; conceiving that
the importance and interest felt in the settlements thereon
held out to me the pleasing hope, that such a publication
would be so desirable to the established landholder and emi


grant settler, as to entitle me to commendation, if not to
reward.
In its publication I am supported by the countenance of
John Oxley, Esq. Surveyor General of the colony; and,
without waiting to seek further patronage, by attending to the
etiquette of first intimating my intention to the Right Hon.
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I entered immediately
upon the labor of completing my Map and arranging my
necessary Notes, with a view, in some measure, to beguile
the tedious hours of a long sea voyage.
The Map contains the result of much more survey than
has actually been performed by me while in the service of
the Crown. The whole of the district near the upper parts
of the stream running into the Hunter and Goulburn rivers,
and its connexion with the very important country of Liver-
pool plains, the coast line between Port Stephens and Lake
Macquarie, and the southern shores of that lake, together
with the surveys and delineation of the country along the
present roads and tracks, have all been laid down at my
private expense. lam indebted to the Agent and Surveyor
to the Australian Agricultural Company for the survey of the
outline of the spacious harbour of Port Stephens; to Mr.
Finch, Crown Surveyor, for the survey of the greatest part of
the Wollomhi brook, and the locations made in that neigh-
bourhood, as also on the north shores of the Lake Macquarie;
to Mr. Ralfe, Crown Surveyor, for the line of the Carrington
and Myall rivers, with part of Smith’s lake: these rivers
however had all been previously traversed by myself, and an
expeditious survey been made, with a view of shewing the


localities and figure of the Australian Agricultural Company’s
grant.
Having myself witnessed very numerous instances in which
emigrant settlers have suffered the most grievous incon-
venience, owing to the impossibility of their being able to
supply themselves with a map of that part of the country
in which they were travelling in search of proper lands for
their purpose, I trust that the Map, with the Index, and
following chapter of information, will enable persons of all
descriptions to proceed to any part of the country there
delineated, and to describe with accuracy the position they
wish to select.
It is of the greatest importance that the emigrant settler
should be so informed as to enable him to vest his capital in
such lands as will afford him the prospect of a seasonable and
remunerating return, rather than in such as will require his
greatest exertion to obtain a maintenance for himself and
family: and yet this last is a danger which he cannot easily
avoid, without the advantage of good information. I hope
therefore that my chapter upon the qualities of the unlocated
lands, particularly of those lying to the eastward of the di-
viding range, and from thence into Liverpool plains, will he
found as useful as I anticipate. 1 conceive that the infor-
mation given in my Index, regarding the amount of quit-rent
payable upon each grant already made in that district, will
be of acknowledged importance to the present landholder.
The terms upon which lands have been granted by the Crown
during the last six years, have been subject to various fluc-
tuations, all affecting the tenure upon which such are held.


With a view of making the subject as intelligible as pos-
sible, I have shewn the date of the order for every grant, with
the amount of annual quit-rent; the amount necessary for
the redemption of the same being also calculated and shewn.
I have introduced the whole of the conditions upon which
his Majesty’s Government now grant and sell lands in the
colony. These being of great importance to the emigrant
settler, he should give them his particular attention previous
to his final determination whether he will emigrate or not.
I have also inserted so much of the now abrogated condi-
tions as appeared to me necessary to shew the tenure under
which a portion of the grants on the Map is held; and also
with a view of furnishing a historical sketch of the land
regulations which have existed since 1810.
In concluding my introductory remarks upon the subject
on which I have treated, I am induced to flatter myself that
the utility of my undertaking will cover any slight inaccuracies
in style or composition. However small my pretensions as a
writer, I trust that a residence of more than seven years in
the colony, in which I have paid particular attention to the
plans and progress of emigrant settlers, the localities of the
country, the qualities of land, and the effect of the various
regulations respecting land, will warrant my present attempt.
At a time when it is probable that thousands of British sub-
jects are turning' their thoughts to emigration, too much
cannot be said upon those points which may enable them
with judgment to decide to which colony they will proceed.
My greatest ambition has been to write with candour and
plainness. I do not wish to attempt to enhance the value of


my work, by bestowing undeserved eulogies on the colony;
nor do I aspire to the praise of elaborate research or great
statistical merit; but shall study to make my Book and Map
a plain, correct, and useful compilation.
On the natural history, and great scientific field which the
colony presents, Ido not intend to touch; these points will,
I doubt not, be ably handled in a publication which I observed
to be announced before I left the colony, by P. Cunningham,
Esq., Surgeon in the Royal Navy. I however regret that I
have not the measurement of the heights above the sea, of the
elevated lands and low country included in my Map. This
happened from my not being able to procure in the colony a
mountain barometer, at the time I wished to have pursued
this object.

This parish affords an excellent
tract of open, sound, and deep
loam up-land country; a most
desirable tract for winter or
spring sheep or cattle grazing,
but owing to the waters being
impregnated with saline matter,
the situation cannot be recom-
mended to settle at.
The Church and School Es-
tate is fine land, and is watered
by a pure stream —Foy-brook.

TOTALS BROUGHT TOGETHER.


GENERAL REFERENCE TO NOTES
IN THE
FOREGOING INDEX .
(a) —Grants ordered by the late Major General Macquarie, who left the
government of New South Wales in November, 1821, and are subject to a
quit rent of two shillings the hundred acres per annum.
(J. P.) —Justices of the Peace for the territory of New South Wales.
(b) —Grants ordered by Governor General Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B.
from the 19 th of May, 1825, to the end of his government in November of the
same year, and are subject to the quit rent of five per Cent, per annum upon
the estimated value of the same. Those lands being not yet valued, I have
stated the quit rent as if existed before this regulation took place.—(See Con-
ditions, page 32.) —The actual rent will, however, exceed that stated, in all
cases where the land is valued at more than three shillings per acre.
(c) —This location was made upon an order for 1000 acres: about 200
acres was allowed the grantee, by the Surveyor General, for the waste occa-
sioned by the large lake, which the boundary lines necessarily included; the
quit rent I have, therefore, stated for 1030 acres.
(d) —The permission to purchase these lands was given by the Government,
subsequent to the promulgation of the King’s new regulations, on the 19th of
May, 1825, directing that all lands sold from that time should be first surveyed
and valued, and then disposed of by public auction, to the highest bidder
above such valuation. Such permission to purchase was, therefore, granted,
subject to the terms of the new regulation with regard to the ultimate price
sold for. The Government, however, have in many cases, (I believe in all that
have offered, but, I understand, on the principle of such permissions so
granted being few in number,) from a desire to commence the new regulations
with the government of Governor-General Darling, received the deposit money
of 10 per Cent, on ss. per acre upon such, agreeably to the sale regulations
as published in March, 1825, by Sir Thomas Brisbane. On those grants,
where no quit rent is carried out in the column, no deposit has been paid,
and such must doubtless be granted as directed in Sir Thomas Brisbane’s
orders.
(e) —Governor General Darling’s grants: quit rent not stated ; to be 5 per
Cent, on the valuation of the Commissioners of Valuation and Boundaries.


(f) —I could not discover the date of the order for this grant, but I think it
subject to the quit rent of 3s. the twenty acres per annum. There are several
others, the dates for the order of which I could not obtain, but presume the
quit rent that I have stated to be correct; corresponding with the period in
which they were severally ordered.
(g) —This grant was really ordered, and the grantee was in possession
previous to the sth of November, 1823, and consequently is only subject to
the small quit rent; but it appears, through a want of the proper registry in
one of the offices, no order was issued until the 30th of November, 1825; the
Government, therefore, in fairness, cannot make the grant chargeable with the
larger quit rent; such is therefore carried out as existed up to the sth of No-
vember, 1823.
(h) —Lands rented of the Crown, at one pound per hundred acres per
annum, agreeably to General Darling’s order, No. 7.
(r) —These locations were ordered by Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B. to the
choice of the individuals named, and called “ Reserves of Land,” being a
liberality evinced to those whose intention it was to become settlers, but whose
avocations would not immediately allow of their doing so :—L e. those holding
civil appointments under Government in the Colony, and those who had once
visited the Colony, and wished to revisit Europe previous to their final settle-
ment. These are now converted into grants, and I have stated the quit rent
corresponding with the period at which they were originally ordered.
(Rr)—These were reserves, ordered for persons who have since left the
Colony, and had not returned in August, 1827, to prosecute their designs of
becoming settlers. From the length of time elapsed, the claims are generally
forfeited, and I have no doubt that Government will, in a short time, other-
wise dispose of these lands.
(•) —The survey of these parishes is not sufficiently advanced to show the
areas.
(»») —The lands called Church and School Lands, are not yet in the pos-
session of the Corporation, (t.e. a Corporation for the management of Church
and School affairs, of the King’s nomination and appointment, consisting of
the Governor, as president, the Archdeacon, and, I think, six or seven of the
senior Colonial Chaplains,) wanting only the being formally made over and
assigned to such Corporation, for the purposes as directed in their charter;
which the Governor of the Colony, by such charter, is empowered to do. As
the Corporation are authorized to sell and lease two-thirds of these lands, and
which it is expected they will very soon begin to do, I have introduced in
my remarks, by way of information to the stranger, a note upon the quality of
each of these respective reserves; some of which are well worthy the attention
of the Emigrant possessed of a competent capital. If able to purchase lands
e 2


at all, these will be the most desirable choice he could make, inasmuch as he
can here make his first settlement with all the advantages, with regard to
locality, as the settler who was many years before him. These appropriations
are coloured green on the map.
CC?' Reference must be made to the date of the order, to discover when
the quit rent upon any estate first attaches: up to the 19th of May, 1825,
it is due in six years after the date of the grant; and from that period, in seven
years after the said date.

CONDITIONS
UPON WHICH LANDS HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN NEW S. WALES
From 1st of January, 1810, to 30 th of November, 1825.
The reservation of quit rent and conditions upon which
lands have heen granted in New South Wales, during the
past few years, have undergone so many alterations, and the
land being held responsible for the due fulfilment of all such
conditions and provisions under which it is held, I feel it to
be of importance that it should he well understood, in order
to guard strangers and colonial purchasers* against error.
I therefore give extracts from such Government orders as
have reference to the grants of my Index; from which the
period will be observed when the quit rent and conditions
underwent any change, and under each order I introduce my
own notes and observations upon the effects of the same.
From the commencement of the government of the late
Governor General Macquarie, in 1810, to his leaving the
government, 30th of November, 1821, one undeviating system
in the condition upon which lands were granted from the
Crown to individuals was observed, viz.
1. For the reservation of quit rent, 2s. per annum for every 100 acres, f
2. For the cultivation in five years, in proportion to extent of grant.
3. For the reservation of timber for naval purposes.
4. For the reservation of land for highways.
5. For the reservation of all mines and minerals.
6. For non-alienation during five years.
* Every person being about to purchase estates in New South Wales, should,
previously to making his offer, require and examine the original title deeds.
Should he purchase upon the guarantee or condition of sale of the seller, merely
to transfer the title deeds, it will be often found, that instead of purchasing a
freehold estate he will receive one subject to various unperformed conditions,
and a yearly quit rent perhaps nearly equal to its value,
t This was exempt for the first six years after the grant was made.


At the commencement of Governor General Sir Thomas
Brisbane’s government, (Ist of December, 1821,) the same
conditions existed up to the fifth of November, 1823, but
with another condition added thereto, viz.
To receive as a servant, and to feed and clothe,* one con-
vict, during the full time of his sentence, for every hundred
acres granted ; and also to pay into the Treasury an annual
sum for each man, for his clerical and medical attendance, if
the settler resided within six miles of a church and hospital.
From the fifth of November, 1823, I shall insert extracts
of the Government orders and proclamations on the subject
of granting and selling lands, which cannot fail to explain
every necessary particular.
“ Colonial Secretary's Office, November 5, 1823.
“ Civil Department.
“ In consequence of instructions received, by the Mary, from his Majesty’s
Ministers, the annual quit rent upon all grants of land promised from this date,
will be three shillings upon every twenty acres; in the event of there being
additional giants, the rent is to be paid immediately, but otherwise at the com-
mencement of the sixth year.
“ By command of the Governor,
“F. GOULBOURN
Colonial Secretary .”
An order was issued, of date November 8, 1824, making a
regulation upon which old colonists might claim grants in
extension; this was done on the same principle as grants
were made to new settlers, only in this case it was necessary,
that the applicant should have maintained for one year, free
of all expence to the Crown, at least one convict for every
hundred acres of his first grant. Thus if A had received, as
his original grant, one thousand acres, and, at the period of
his application for a grant in extension, it appeared from the
Colonial Secretary’s books, that he had maintained twenty
convicts in the preceding year, he would he entitled to an
order in extension of 1000 acres.
This regulation, although its principles were so injurious.
• The cost to an emigrant settler, for providing each convict, was about £2O
a year.


nay unfair, towards the emigrant settler, in obliging him to
receive and maintain convicts which were not bargained for
previous to his leaving England, was a very proper one in
reference to the old colonists. Grants of land in extension
could not he expected by the colonist free of restrictions;
therefore it was a wise and legitimate measure, calculated to
meet, in a satisfactory manner, the various applications for
such grants ; and also tending to lessen to the British nation
the expense of the convict establishment, and at the same
time adding to her national bulk, by bringing waste forests
into culture and improvement. The expense to the Crown
is estimated at about £l6 per annum for each convict; and
the land ordered under this regulation being subject to the
annual quit rent of 15s. the hundred acres, the twenty years’
purchase of which is £l5, the person thus receiving land
paid to the Crown a sum equal to £3l per hundred acres,
or about 65. 2 \d. per acre; a sum certainly equal to the
value of most lands in the colony.
« GOVERNMENT AND GENERAL ORDERS.
“ Civil Department.
Sydney, December 29, 1824.
“ His Excellency the Governor having deemed it expedient to make certain
alterations in the conditions heretofore inserted in the grants of land given to
settlers, is pleased to direct, that the new form of grants, together with a
schedule of the conditions intended to be imposed, applicable to all grants from
thirty acres to two thousand, should be published, for the guidance and infor-
mation of those concerned.
“ Numerous applications having been made to his Excellency, by indivi-
duals who have expressed a desire to be permitted to purchase certain portions
of unoccupied Crown lands, near to or adjoining their present grants; and his
Excellency being of opinion, that the sale of land, under certain limitations,
will be highly beneficial to the settler, hereby notifies, (until his Majesty’s
pleasure is known,) that he will continue to receive applications for the pur-
chase of waste lands, and now directs, that the form of the grant, which will
hereafter be given to the purchaser of the said lands, together with extracts
from his instructions to the Surveyor General on the subject, be published for
general information.”*
* The price of lands sold under this regulation was ss. per acre, reserving
the yearly quit rent of 2s. the hundred acres, and the right of making roads;
ten per Cent., as a deposit, to be paid before possession was given, and the
remainder in three years, by six instalments, being one at every interval of six
months.


Then follows the form of grants, the extract from instruc-
tions to the Surveyor General, and the schedule of condi-
ditions, of which I shall only insert the latter, the former
not being of sufficient importance.
“ It is expected, and will be inserted as a condition in the holding of all
future grants, that the settler receiving a grant of thirty acres, shall clear and
cultivate ten acres thereof, or maintain three convicts for one year, or erect
buildings, fences, or other permanent improvements, to the value of £5O,
within the term of five years; which value shall be ascertained by two persons,
one to be appointed by the Crown, and the other by the Grantee.

By his Excellency’s command,

On the 4th of May, 1825, an order was published, making
it optional to settlers who had received orders for land under
the obligatory regulation of maintaining one man for every
hundred acres, and whose title-deeds were not yet delivered
* These conditions were exclusive of the reservation of quit rent, and other
reservations, as noted, pp. 31,32, which were highly approved of by the public,
and such as any bona fide settler could not fail to fulfil in the time given; the
clause, as it before existed, making it imperative on new settlers, if they received
land, to receive and maintain a given number of convicts, being rescinded. The
object of Government being that a specific improvement should be made, it was left
optional to the settler whether he would employ convict or free labour to accom-
plish it. Government also, at this date, declined receiving the word of honour of
the settler as regarded the amount of his capital, and consequent number of
acres which he claimed thereon, assuming the right, which they certainly had,
of requiring proof of capital.


to them, either to receive such under the regulation which
had ordered it, or under those of the 29th of December,
1824. This was certainly evincing a very proper liberality
towards those settlers who had felt the hardships of com-
plying with the former regulations; and thus an order was
completely annihilated, the original framer of which could
neither have had policy, expediency, or necessity in view
when he recommended it.
The indulgence to emigrant settlers of having themselves,
families, and a proportionate number of convict servants to
the capital they possessed, victualled from the King’s maga-
zines, for six months, was discontinued by proclamation, of
date the 25th of May, 1825.
In this month, May, 1825, a new code of regulations,
framed in Downing Street, for the future granting and selling
of land, reached the Colony, and was published, which pos-
sesses great merit for its perspicuity and fairness, and
which I have placed at the head of my chapter on General
Darling’s land orders. From this period, the granting of
land by Sir Thomas Brisbane was suspended for some
time, and that which was subsequently ordered by him,
up to his leaving the government the 30th of November,
1825, should be now confirmed* under the provisions of this
regulation. This also superseded Sir Thomas’s regulation
for the selling of lands; short lived as it was (from four to
* In alluding to lands ordered from May to the end of November, 1825, it
must be understood, that none of it was really granted, i. e. the title deeds
delivered previous to Sir Thomas Brisbane’s leaving the government. These,
with very many other grants of prior date to May, 1825, were left for his suc-
cessor to confirm.
General Darling had not, however, up to August, 1827, made any issue of title
deeds, and on any person applying for them, a letter is written him, laying down
a new condition under which the grant is intended to be confirmed, such being at
complete variance with the conditions under which it was originally made. What
can warrant such glaring breaches of a bona fide contract, —a bargain between
the King and his subjects ? And why should not every grant be made according
to the particular condition under which it was ordered ?


five months) it will in some measure give proof of the
resources of the colony, when I state, that in that short
period 369,050 acres were sold to the colonists at s s. per
acre.
Another order on the subject of land will bring me to the
end of Sir Thomas Brisbane’s administration, which I shall
give verbatim, and shall then enter upon matter, I hope,
more agreeable, and more connected with the interest of the
emigrant settler.
“ GOVERNMENT PUBLIC NOTICE.
“ Colonial Secretary’s Office, November 10, 1825.
“ Whereas various grants of land have been made in New South Wales and
its Dependencies, on condition not to be alienated within five years, from the
date hereof; and whereas such condition was imposed in order to insure the
due cultivation of the said lands; —but, generally, this object has been effected,
although that condition has not been strictly observed: —now, therefore, in all
cases in which fences, clearing, or buildings shall have been completed
according to the condition in the said respective grants contained, I do hereby
release all the rights which have accrued to his Majesty, his heirs and suc-
cessors, to the same lands, in respect of any breach of the aforesaid condition
before the announcement of his Majesty’s new regulations, on the 18th day of
May last.
“ By his Excellency’s command.
“F. GOULBURN, Colonial Secretary."
This order legitimatized the title of a very considerable
extent of land in the colony, which, in consequence of the
infringement of what was considered an obsolete condition,
was rendered questionable. This excellent Governor could
not have closed his government with a more wise or popular
act, —he could in no better manner have evinced the interest
he felt for the colony, or the sound discretion he was gener-
ally guided by. Sir Thomas found that many hundreds (I
believe I may say thousands) of grants had been bonaJide
sold, before the conditioned period of five years had elapsed,
and thus they were liable to forfeiture, if the representative
of the King thought proper. The system of selling grants
unreservedly is not of recent date, it having prevailed since
the earliest period of granting lands in the colony: and thus


the condition of non-alienation for five years has been thought
completely obsolete, and was never judged worthy of serious
notice.
The colonists were at last undeceived in their belief of
safety, through the supposed obsoleteness of the condition;
and they have, in some measure, to thank Colonel Arthur,
Governor of Van Diemen’s Land, for the promulgation of the
foregoing order. He, finding in Van Diemen’s Land, as well
as in New South Wales, that very numerous grants had
changed masters before the prescribed period; and, doubt-
less, supposing (as in making capitulations or conventions
with an enemy) he could not better evince his zeal for his
Majesty’s interest than by mooting this question, which he
did, by spreading terror and alarm amongst his subjects,
inducing the general belief that the whole of these grants
would again revert and become the property of the Crown,
actually refused to deliver the title deeds to the attorneys
of the grantees, when they were forwarded by order of the
Governor in Chief for delivery.
In this state of affairs, Sir Thomas Brisbane was referred
to, who immediately annihilated Colonel Arthur’s design, by
issuing the foregoing order.
This condition was first attached to grants in the penal
days of the colony, when grants were only given to those
who had been convicts, and who had become free by serving
the period of their sentence, or by receiving their emancipa-
tion from the Governor. At this period only was this con-
dition applicable to the state of the colony; it, perhaps, was
not inexpedient then to guard the imprudent man, and he
who had but just escaped from his bondage, from incurring
debts through the wiles of his cunning neighbour or shop-
keeper, to an amount greater than his real necessities
required, and beyond what he was capable of discharging
without selling or mortgaging his little estate.


To such men, and in such times, this regulation might be
proper; but to tell an emigrant settler that he must not sell
or alienate land before the end of five years, is restricting
him to a condition he never contemplated before reaching
the colony.
The foregoing extracts and notes will bring to view the
principle and conditions upon which lands were*"assigned to
settlers, up to the termination of Sir Thomas Brisbane’s
government, (November, 1825;) and although they are now
entirely abrogated, it has reference to the holding of all
grants made during the period of his administration. This
period will also be an interesting epoch in the history of
New South Wales, being that in which a great political
change took place in the colony, by its penal character being,
in some degree, lessened, and the British Government first
allowing unrestricted and free emigration to flock to her
shores; and, as a consequence of free emigration, the intro-
duction of some of the glorious and inimitable institutions of
the mother country.
• From the whole tenor of Sir Thomas Brisbane’s legislation
on the granting of land, it will he seen that his paramount
object was to economise, and lessen to the British nation the
great expenses of the convict establishment.
That this should he done by every legitimate means, and
that the necessity for it was, and is still, urgent, no one can
dispute; but for the Government first to induce and encou-
rage emigrants of capital to proceed to New South Wales,
in the prospect of being rewarded by a grant of land, and
then to make the granting of it subject to a compulsory mea-
sure of keeping free from charge to the nation a body of con-
victs, could, in no view of the case, be just qr expedient.
Though this one act did amount to an error in legislation,
it must he acknowledged, that in every other land-order,
strict justice was done to the settler, and great liberality


evinced, both in framing the regulations and executing the
various provisions of them.
In taking a glimpse of the immense strides which only
one part of the colony made in settlement and colonization,
from the early part of 1822 to the end of 1825 (see page 25),
no despicable proof is conveyed of the interest felt—the
business really gone through, and the service done both to
the state and a numerous body of her subjects, by the local
authorities of the colony of those years.
COUNTIES.
The territory of New South Wales, agreeably to the
King’s new Regulations for that very object, is to be di-
vided into Counties, to contain an area of forty miles square.
Those are to be subdivided into sections of one mile square,
and into parishes of six miles square, or thirty-six square
miles.*
To examine the country, and assign the boundaries to the
counties, hundreds, and parishes, forms a part of the duty
of three commissioners of the Governor’s appointment.
This, however, cannot be accomplished before the more im-
portant, and much more laborious, task of the land surveyor,
of tracing and laying down all streams, completely survey-
ing and marking the boundaries of every section of square
mile, and delineating the face of the country, has been per-
formed.
Although the surveys, &c. of that part of the colony deli-
neated on my map, and of which I shall attempt a particular
description, are far advanced, the commissioners have not
yet f visited it to perform their prescribed duty. . Hence it
* In the latest regulations the parishes are ordered to contain twenty-five
square miles, or five miles square; an area much too small for proper conve-
nie«ce.
f August, 1827.


is, that the particular boundary to the countries named in
the Index are not given. It has., however, been long the in-
tention of his Majesty’s government‘to designate the country
on the south bank of Hunter’s River as part of the county
of Northumberland, and by this name it has already been
known; that of the north hank, as part of Durham; and the
country to the westward of those counties, as the county of
Roxburgh.
In all probability, on the boundaries being completely as-
signed to these counties, they will he nearly thus:—The
county of Northumberland, bounded on the south by the
river Hawkesbury, on the east by the sea, on the north by
the river Hunter, and on the west by a south line from
about the junction of the Hunter and Goulburn rivers, to
some branch of the Hawkesbury river.
The county of Durham, on the south and west by the
river Hunter; on the north by an east line, (commencing
about the junction of Page’s and Hunter’s rivers,) to the sea-
coast, or until such east line falls in with and joins an east-
ward stream; then by that stream to the sea-coast, and on
the east by the sea-coast.
The county of Roxburgh, bounded on the east by the river
Hunter; on the south by the river Goulburn; and on the
north and west by lines east and west, and north and south.
I should here remark, that the view of the Noble Secre-
tary of State, in directing each county to contain an area of
forty miles square (which is upwards of one million acres),
was, by-and-bye, to assimilate this antipodean wing of the
British empire, in its church, county, hundred, and paro-
chial governments and arrangements, to that system which
our forefathers (with few alterations) have handed down to
us, and which works so admirably well in the mother coun-
try. The presumed boundaries which I have stated, for the
counties of Northumberland and Durham, will include a
much greater area than that just alluded to. These counties


will, however, include a more than common proportion of
barren country : the sea-coast belt of from fifteen to twenty
miles (except on the margin of streams) is generally barren;
and, moreover, in the tract between the rivers Hunter and
Hawkesbury, is the Blue Mountain Range, occupying about
three-fourths of the whole space.
In the county of Durham is also a large tract of moun-
tainous and inaccessible country; I mean that irregular ridge
described on the map, and bounding on the north the valley
through which the river Hunter takes its sinuosities and
gathers its waters; while the northern margin of the Blue
Mountain Range, in the county of Northumberland, bounds
the fertile valley on the south. With regard to the division
of the territory into counties, on account of its great diver-
sity of soil and surface, I should say, that the commissioners
should not be bound to the particular area so directed, but
should have the discretionary power to lay down the coun-
ties of greater or less extent, as the localities of the coun-
try appear to warrant, and in which they should be more
guided by the probable number of inhabitants which a tract
of country would admit, than by its actual area.
PARISHES.
The assigning of boundaries to parishes, as well as counties,
belongs to the land commissioners, which, I have before
observed, are ordered to contain an area of six miles square;
the figure of parishes, as intended, cannot however be posi-
tively observed, on account of making all navigable and other
streams parish boundaries. The sides, therefore, whereof
streams are boundaries, must be irregular, and the area
varying more or less from that directed; the range of
parishes, not connected with such streams, will doubtless
be uniformly as they are designed on my map —thirty-six
square miles, or 23,040 acres. The whole of the parishes,
F


so far to the westward as Lemington and Ravensworth, were
laid down nearly as they now stand, and named during the
government of Sir Thomas Brisbane, being generally, though
not geographically, corresponding with the towns and vil-
lages of the British counties, the names of which are here
perpetuated on the shores of the great Pacific Ocean.
In the country on Hunter’s river, laying to .the westward
of Ravensworth and Lemington, the parishes have not been
designed or named by the local Government; I have there-
fore, with a view of being able the better to make refer-
ence to the lands located and unlocated, in the neighbour-
hood now alluded to, carried on the design as in the coun-
try to the eastward, of apportioning parishes, and assigning
names to them, on the same principle as that followed under
the authority of Sir Thomas Brisbane.
I do not expect that the parish boundaries, as here laid
down, will be allowed to exist, which, however, will affect
no one, my object only being to make easy reference to these
lands.
RIVERS AND MINOR STREAMS.
The river Hunter is the most considerable of the streams
of that part of the colony now under notice, and only infe-
rior to the river Hawkesbury of those yet settled upon in
New South Wales. Its sources are found to rise in an
elevated and generally inaccessible range of Basaltic Moun-
tains, known by the designation of Dividing Range. This
ridge, whose range through the country is about north-east
and south-west, is so called on account of the waters fall-
ing on its south-east side running to the Hunter, and other
streams; the outlet of which is on the eastern coast of
New South Wales; whilst those falling on the other side run
northward, but their outlet into the sea is not yet ascer-
tained. The Hunter being formed by numberless drains


and streams from the dividing range, first takes a south-west
course, a considerable distance, through a rough and almost
untenantable country, (except by its original proprietors,)
being the lateral and other branching ridges of the dividing
range, until it reaches within a few miles of Page’s river,
when it opens into a spacious, fertile, and beautifully pictu-
resque valley ; continuing from thence its south-west course
about thirty-five miles, to its junction with the Goulburn,
but in its windings about double that distance, in which it
receives the waters of Page’s river, Dart brook, Kingdon
ponds, and some other small streams.
The rich alluvial lands on this part of the river, (St. Ger-
main and Twickenham meadows,) are without parallel in
the known parts of the colony; there being a chain, at alter-
nate sides, the whole distance, varying in breadth from one-
half to two miles. Some parts are without timber, and
others have no more than enhances, rather than detracts
from, their value, with an inexhaustible soil, and a natural
herbage, but little inferior to the most improved English
meadows. Such is the character of the meadows on this
part of Hunter’s river.
From the junction of the Goulburn the Hunter’s course is
eastward, to the parish of Morpeth, distant by the river
ninety miles. So far as the parish of Wittingham the
meadows are but little less extensive or inferior in quality
to those just spoken of. At the parish of Morpeth the Hun-
ter becomes navigable for small craft of about twenty-five
tons burthen, this being the extreme point at which the tide
has effect.
Above this point, only boats can be used, and these not
without obstruction from frequent rapids, and large trees
brought down and lodged by every flood. Boats are not, at
present, used by the settlers higher than the parishes of
Gosforth and Stanhope ; yet I have myself taken a whale-
boat, heavily laden with luggage, to the parish of Witting-
ly 2


ham, and I am not without hopes, by clearing some of the
wreck timber, and by using boats on the principle of the
Canadian batteaux, and also by consulting the state of the
river, when it is neither swollen by rains, or low through
long droughts, that produce may be sent down by water to
advantage from this neighbourhood. From Morpeth, or
what is provincially called Wallis’s plains, the course of the
river is eastward and south-east, forty-one miles from the
mouth of Wallis’s creek to King’s town, having water suffi-
cient, from the junction of the Patterson, for vessels of a
hundred tons burthen.
The banks of the river, so low down as Morpeth, are sub-
ject to inundations, the river sometimes rising thirty or forty
feet above its usual level.
The tributary streams to the Hunter are, the William
river, navigable for large boats about twenty-five miles above
its junction; thence upwards, a small river, taking its
sources from the mountainous section of the country, about
thirty miles north-westward.
Patterson’s river is navigable for boats to within two miles
of the junction of its two streams, at the parish of Barford.
The westward stream, being rather the largest, is continued
as the Patterson; both having their sources in the same
mountainous tract of country, and in about the same parallel
northward as William river.
TFollombi brook rises in the Blue Mountain range, running
near the basis north westward; and has its junction with the
Hunter at the eastern corner of the parish of Lemington.
Foy, Fal, Glendon, and West brooks, are all permanent
streams of good water, having their sources in the elevated
ridges which bound the Hunter’s river vale on the north.
The Goulburn river takes its rise in the Blue Mountain
and dividing ranges, running near the basis of the former,
and has its junction with the Hunter at the south-w r est comer
of the parish of Barnardcastle.


Page’s river, Dart brook, and Kingdon ponds, all take
their sources in the dividing range, running through fertile
and romantic vallies, and having their junction with the
Hunter, in the parish of Judburgh.
Having remarked upon the Hunter and its waters, I would
here observe, with regard to the overflowing of them, that,
as there is not in this part of New South Wales any fixed
rainy season,, the time of its overflowing is not periodical.
It is gratifying to know, that no great flood has happened in
the river Hunter during the last seven years; its greatest
height, during several rainy periods, being some feet within
its banks, and only breaking out where the country was low,
or where they had been removed by former floods. I there-
fore presume it to be a reasonable inference, from the chan-
nel of the river being (by the annual freshes) both deepened
and widened, as well as a consequent increase in the height
of the banks, by the deposits left, and also an increase oc-
casioned through the annual decomposition of matter grown
thereon ; that the time has arrived in which the inundation
of its banks will not take place except in very extraordinary
wet seasons.
These floods cannot, however, be held as an objection to
the possession of lands on the banks of these streams ; on
the contrary, to such the settlers are indebted for the fertile
meadows they occupy, as well as for their crops in seasons
of long drought; when the uplands are become dry, and the
crops parched, the inundated lands, during these periods,
retaining their moisture, and at harvest time affording the
anxious farmer a liberal reward for his toil; —in a word,
without such lands as these, this part of New South Wales
would have no particular fertility to boast of, nor would the
soil offer any great inducement for the labour of the agricul-
turist.
The streams next necessary to be remarked upon are the
Carrington and Larpent, both flowing through the lands of the


Australian Agricultural Company, and are navigable for
small craft, of about 20 tons burthen, nearly to the position
marked “ Fords” on the map, the former being V]\ and the
latter 15i miles from the town and settlement of the Company.
The Myall river within the same lands has unfortunately a
bar of sand at its mouth, with only about six feet of water
over it at the highest tide ; therefore only large boats, of flat
build, can be used on this stream, and for such it is naviga-
ble into Smith’s lake (the distance being 16 miles), and up
the several streams falling into that lake; the principal one
of which, the Myall, is navigable for boats upwards of 20
miles.
TOWNS.
The division of New South Wales, now under consider-
ation, having been so recently settled, it will not be expected
that Towns can yet have been built, but some are com-
menced and others contemplated. I merely purpose to
record the period of foundation and the progress made.
King’s Town, (formerly Newcastle, so called from a vein
of coal having been discovered in the cliff,) was first deter-
mined upon in the year 1803-4, by Governor King, as a
proper place to transport criminals to, who were convicted
of crimes committed in the Colony.
Prisoners continued to he transported here in such num-
bers, that in the early part of the Government of Sir Thos.
Brisbane, he found that the place would afford but an inade-
quate quantity of labour, nor was its distance sufficiently
remote from Sydney, to prevent convicts often breaking
from their keepers and effecting their escape to the latter
place. From the above named reasons, and from the lands
on Hunter’s river being required for emigrant settlers, it
was determined, in the year 1822, to relinquish Newcastle as
a penal settlement; and arrangements were made to remove


the whole of the prisoners to Port Macquarie, a port disco-
vered in 1818, by Mr. Oxley, and recommended by him as
a fit place for an establishment of the same nature as that at
Newcastle.
It was not until near the end of 1822, that the arrangements
were so complete as to allow the Government to remove this
body of prisoners from Newcastle, and not until then was
the land on the hanks of Hunter’s river open to the choice
of settlers. At the period of Sir Thomas Brisbane throwing
this port open to trade, and allowing emigrants, mechanics,
and artificers to proceed thither, the town, or then more
appropriately called “the camp,” only consisted of buildings
belonging to the Crown, with cottages and huts which the
commanding officers of the settlement had allowed the best
behaved of the convicts to build, which they did after they
had performed their daily task of crown labour.
About this time, that of its transformation from a penal
place to a free part of the Colony, Sir Thomas Brisbane, in
honor to the memory of the founder. Governor King, named
it King’s Town, and the parish in which it is situated,
Newcastle. The present ground plan of King’s Town was
designed and laid out by myself, in 1823, which was sub-
mitted to, and approved of by, the Governor. Since that
period, town allotments for building have continued to he
given to individuals (see Index to Town, page 28). King’s
Town is situated on a neck of land on the south shore of the
rivet Hunter, and near its mouth, being on a commanding
site, rising from the river at a very proper angle of elevation,
and having the river and some islands on the north-west,
while it overlooks the sea in the east and south-east. Its
public, or government buildings, consist of a church, once
a neat edifice; but latterly divine service has not been per-
formed in it in consequence of the steeple having been con-
sidered unsafe, and which is now taken down; the other
public buildings are, the residence of the resident police


magistrate, the parsonage house, surgeon’s quarters, court
house, subaltern officers’ quarters, commissariat store, mili-
tary barrack and guard room, hospital, gaol, residence of
mining manager, wind mills, &c. &c., with a fort, on the
extremity of the neck of land commanding the entrance of
the harbour, which is capable of being made very strong.
Its private houses do not yet amount to more than from
twenty-five to thirty; and about 200 inhabitants, (exclusive
of the Government mining establishment,) amongst which
are store-keepers, or mercantile men, shop-keepers, inn-
keepers, (five in number,) carpenters, bricklayers, brick-
makers, blacksmiths, &c. &c.
The exports from King’s Town, (the produce of the fertile
country on the river,) must, in a few years, become very
considerable. Its greatest trade at present is in coals and
timber, shipped in small coasting vessels to Sydney, both
for home consumption and exportation ; the former is sold
by Government at ten shillings per ton, and of which there
are from 150 to 200 tons weekly exported.
No export direct to Europe has yet taken place, though
from the great quantity of wool now annually raised, the
growers will save the expense of the conveyance to Sydney,
by shipping from King’s Town direct for England; and it is
expected the first ship will load there in the early part of
next year, (1828.) The present products sent to Sydney
coastwise, may he enumerated thus: wool, coal, timber,
wheat, maize, hides, salted beef, pork and hams, butter,
cheese, eggs, leaf tobacco, kangaroo skins, &c. &c.
There has been for some time a regular packet vessel, for
goods and passengers, sailing from Sydney every Friday,
and from King’s Town every Tuesday, which, for accommo-
dation and goodness of fare, equals that description of ves-
sel so well- known in England.
I have before remarked, that the Newcastle coal mines are
still' worked by the Government, supplied with labourers


from the refractory convicts returned by the settlers to
Government.
It is, however, to he regretted, (as those men could he
employed equally advantageous in road making,) that this
work, which is capable of being made very productive,*
should he any longer carried on by the state, whom it does
not become, (without strong local circumstances demand
it,) to be either speculating in coal mines, or dabbling in
farming.
The, British Government, doubtless seeing the inutility of
any longer working this mine, leased it for a term of years
to the Australian Agricultural Company, who have, at a
great expence, sent out a competent manager, several
miners and their families, and two steam engines, with the
necessary apparatus, for the purpose of working it effectu-
ally. Through some mismanagement some where, the Com-
pany have not, (as was expected,) received possession of it;
and after taking the machinery to Port Stephens, in the pros-
pect of mining in their own lands, (but in which they have
failed,) they have now sent it to Sydney, with a view, as I
believe, to its being sold. The mine is, therefore, continued
to be worked by the Crown, at a supposed loss, and the
country is deprived of the advantages which must have
accrued, had it been worked by the Company.
Notwithstanding King’s Town has been retarded, owing
to the bad working of the mine, there is no doubt, hut that
* It is the opinion of Mr. Busby, tnineralogical surveyor, and cival engineer
to Government, who has had considerable experience in coal mining, that the
Newcastle mine, if under the direction of proper managers, and the necessary
capital vested in steam power, &c. is capable of presenting a good prospect
to the speculator, even if he were to sell coals at fifty per cent, less than they
are now sold for by Government.
Considerable quantities have been already sent to Bio Janeiro, Isle of France,
Batavia, Calcutta, and Bombay, but the merchants find that the present price
at the pit’s mouth, will not allow them a fair profit for the speculation, which is
at this time a bar to the trade, and consequently now almost discontinued.


in a few years it will become a place of considerable resort
and trade.
The capital and skill of the settlers already in active ope-
ration; the great extent of fertile country, the product of
which must be exported by way of King’s Town, independent
of its indiginous resources in coal and timber; will bear me
out in premising, that it will be inferior only to the seat of
Government, Sydney, in the scale of the rising towns of New
South Wales.
It will be seen that many of the allotments of land in
King’s Town, have been assigned to settlers who have lands
on the river, and who will, of course, bring their estates and
buildings on them in comfortable order, before they carry
their intention of building town houses into effect. From
the commanding site on which King’s Town stands ; from
its acknowledged salubrious position, in receiving every sea
breeze, however light; and from its possessing great natural
conveniences for bathing; it may reasonably be expected
that the planters and their families will, ere long, during the
hot and relaxing months, retire here from their habitations
in the country.
At King’s Town are held two sessions in the year, at
which a stipendiary Chairman* (a lawyer) presides, for the
disposal of all petty offences, not required to be heard before
the supreme Criminal Court held at Sydney.—King’s Town
is supplied with water by springs, over which bad wells are
dug, but which are capable of being improved, and will then
afford an unlimited supply of water at all times.
Several positions, affording proper sites for interior towns,
were set apart for that purpose in the Hunter’s river coun-
try, during the Government of Sir Thomas Brisbane; but up
* A reflection not very creditable to the New South Wales Magistracy; if
gentlemen cannot be found amongst them competent to take the chair, as in
England, they must be mere figures—mere cadets. As the grand jury are the
guardians of all expenditure appertaining to the justice and police of the coun-
try, I feel surprised that they have overlooked this glaring incongruity.


to this time the ground plans have not been designed, al-
though at two of the places alluded to, a commencement has
been made.
At Morpeth, in the county of Northumberland, (being 18|
miles by the road from King’s Town, and 41 from that place
by the river, and 126| miles from Sydney by the new road,)
is a court-house, gaol, and' military barrack, and it is in-
tended by the Church Corporation to build a church and
school room. This place is the residence of a military offi-
cer, commanding a party of mounted police, stationed here
for the protection of the neighbouring country.
At Butterwick and Middlehope, (being 26§ miles from
King’s Town and 134£ miles from Sydney,) in the county of
Durham, are two sites set apart for towns. Here a party of
military is stationed; and the Church Corporation intend
erecting the same buildings as at Morpeth.
At Wittingham, in the county of Northumberland, (being
43| miles from King’s Town and 1271 miles from Sydney,)
a gaol, court-house, and a building for church and school
purposes, are intended to be erected.
The sites intended for towns are marked with a steeple
upon the map.
The British Government have recently formed several set-
tlements on the coast of New Holland. The sites made
choice of are no doubt very proper ; and it is hoped the pre-
sent commencement is the foundation of future great towns.
These settlements arc at King George’s Sound and Western
Port on the south-east coast, and Port Essington on the
north-west coast: it should, however, be known, that they
are supposed to have been formed with reference to the penal
necessities of the colony; but not being aware of their neces-
sity for that purpose, I trust it will be found they are judicious
selections, formed with a view of allowing speedy emigration
and colonization to extend thither.—These settlements, with
those of Port Macquarie, Moreton Bay, and Melville Island,


being used only as penal places, are of course all under the
direction of military commandants. This species of govern-
ment should be changed into the civil authority of the police
magistrate, in the event of either of these places being open
to free trade and settlement, before any emigrant settler
ventures to settle near them. The dictum of some military
commandants, and the ideas of the British emigrant settler,
are constantly coming in collision, to the great chagrin and
discomfiture of the latter.
HARBOURS.
Port Hunter, being in lat. 32 3 56' 30' S. and long. 151°
42' E. on which King’s town is situated, is formed by
the outlet of the river Hunter into the sea. The entrance
to port Hunter is obstructed by a bar of sand, though it is of
a far less dangerous nature than the generality of bar har-
bours. There is a channel over the bar, with from three to
three and a half fathoms at low water, which consequently
will allow vessels, up to about four hundred tons burthen, a
safe entrance. The harbour may always be approached with
safety, except when the wind is strong from the south south-
east to south-west; during which season, a vessel on getting
under the lee of Nohhy island, is likely to be be-calmed, and set
out of the channel, on the breakers towards the north shore.
With the wind moderate from any quarter, or, if night is
at hand, and beating be necessary to reach the anchorage off
King’s Town vessels may with safety bring to on the north
side, and within a half-cable’s length of Nohhy island. As a
direct trade with England, and other ports, may, in a short
time, be anticipated, I shall add to my own description of
this port, a direction for entering it, kindly afforded me by
Mr. Alexander Livingston, commander of the packet vessel
Lord Liverpool, who, for many years, has been constantly
running between Sydney and Port Hunter, without meeting
with the slightest accident.


" Strangers should not approach, or attempt to run into Port Hunter, when
the weather is bad ; though, if keeping to sea should be difficult, the harbour
of Port Stephens can be safely entered.
“ In sailing into Port Hunter from the southward, give the east end of
Nobby island a good berth, to avoid a cluster of rocks, having on them about
two fathoms water, over which the sea does not break in fine weather. This
danger is about a cable’s length outside the reef of rocks, which is always
visible. Haul up for the harbour, on opening with the island. The middle
one of three pointed hills, which are some distance inland, to the westward.
Sail then within a half cable’s length of the island, when the lead will seldom
give less than quarter-less-four. The channel is narrow, and should a vessel,
by the set of tide, or any other circumstance, be found approaching the north
margin of the channel, she should be immediately brought to. The vessel’s
course to the town, after crossing the bar, is about south-west and by south.
Vessels from the northward should, on standing in, keep Nobby island well
open on the starboard side; fall into the tract, and be guided by the same rule,
as a vessel from the southward. There is good anchorage under Nobby island
in four and a half fathoms, laying as close to the island as possible, to prevent
tailing into the shoal water, towards the north shore. The tide runs, at the
island, about three and a half knots; and, opposite the breakwater, four knots.
A vessel in the offing, if standing off and on, during the night should be careful
not to approach too near the deep bay to the northward of Port Hunter, the
swell often setting on that shore, and, particularly in light winds, the danger
is greater, the current generally setting northward.”
From these directions, the nature of Port Hunter can well
he judged of, which is such as cannot possibly be any bar to
vessels loading there direct for Europe, or any other part of
the world.
On the weather being moderate, the pilot will board
strange vessels three or four miles in the offing; but, when
he does not come off, the stranger must be guided by the
following signals, which are made at the fort, on the point
near the town.
SIGNALS TO VESSELS IN THE OFFING.
A blue flag, pierced with a yellow square.— Stand off to sea, it is not safe to
approach the harbour.
A yellow flag, pierced with a blue square.— Stand in for the harbour, you
may approach with safety,
A white flag, pierced with a red square.— Lay to for a boat.
A red flag, pierced with a blue square.— The pilot boat has left the town.
SIGNALS FROM THE FORT TO THE TOWN.
A blue ensign.— A vessel of war.
A yellow flag.— A merchant ship.
A yellow flag, with a red St. George’s cross.— A brig.
A yellow flag, with a blue St. Andrew’s cross.— A schooner.
A yellow and blue (perpendicular) flag.— A cutter.
A red flag.— The pilot is on board the vessel coming in.


PENDANTS FOR COLONIAL VESSELS.
A blue pendant, with an union. —A Government vessel.
A yellow pendant. —A ship.
A pendant, yellow, red, yellow. —A brig.
A pendant, blue, yellow, blue. —A schooner.
A pendant, yellow and blue. —A cutter.
A union jack flying on Sundays, national anniversary days, and holidays.
There is a large coal fire lighted up every evening at sun
set, on the point of land near the fort and signal station,
simply on the top of a mound a few feet above the surface.
This fire consumes about half a ton of coal per night, and
gives a large and clear light, which can be seen in fine wea-
ther about twenty miles at sea.
A breakwater was commenced here some years ago,
intended to stop up the shoal channel between the main land
and Nobby island, when the coal mines ceased to afford
employment sufficient for the convicts transported thither.
On this undertaking, from one to four hundred men were
employed for a long period; and, at a low estimate, it has
already cost the Government upwards of £25,000. This
work was very properly discontinued by Sir Thomas Bris-
bane, in 1822, it being then, after from five to six years’
labour, not carried more than half the distance across, and
had but just reached the deepest part of the channel. The
service expected to be done to the port, from the erection of
the breakwater, is this —the bar was supposed to be formed
in part, if not altogether, by the sands brought in by the
swell through the shoal channel between Nobhy island and
the main, which, meeting with a counter current, through the
waters of the river and the swell of the main channel, on the
north side of the island, caused the impetuosity of the whole
to cease, and an eddy was produced, which was the supposed
great cause of the bar. My opinion is, that the bar is but
slightly increased or affected by this cause, inasmuch as it is
half a mile outside the junction of these conflicting currents •,
such waters must, therefore, have resumed their unobstructed
course before reaching the position of the bar. There being.


however, no doubt that quantities of sand are thrown in,
through the shoal channel, which are emitted again by way
of the greater channel, these must add, in some degree, to the
bar. By the completion of the breakwater, I have, therefore,
no doubt that the channel will be deepened, partly from the
cause before alluded to, and partly also by confining the
whole ingress of the tide waters, and egress of the river and
tide waters, to one channel, which,,being a greater body,
would he allowed to flow to a greater distance before it could
he eddied by the preponderating weight of the sea. I do not,
however, think that the original projector of this work can
be excused of want of wisdom.
The port was perfectly safe, with common caution, for
ships to enter, up to four hundred’ tons burthen; and also
land-locked, and safe at the anchorage, in the river off King’s
town.
The superabundant convicts could have been equally well
punished, and much better employed, in clearing land prepa-
ratory to colonization extending thither. Thus a great
improvement' in the country would have been effected, and
the expense of supporting the convicts, if not altogether,
would have been, in a great measure, ultimately reimbursed.
In short, it is far too liberal an expenditure of national
property, for the degree of public good here expected to be
done ; should the work be ever again entered upon, which I
do not anticipate in the present age, it should be carried into
effect by a joint-stock company, under the sanction of an act
of Parliament.
PORT STEPHENS.
The entrance to this spacious harbour, on the north side
of which the settlement of the Australian Agricultural Com-
pany was first formed, in January, 1826, lies, according to
Mr. Oxley, in lat. 32 3 42' 45" S. long. 152 3 9'E. and is perfectly
safe at all seasons, except when the wind blows from west to


south-west. On entering the harbour, the only danger to be
avoided is a sand spit, extending some distance from the
south head towards the north, which at low water is shoal,
hut terminates spirally, and leaves a channel of good breadth,
carrying from five to nine fathoms water. On sailing in,
therefore, steer on either side the islands off the entrance,
and within half cable’s length of the north shore, (/. e. the
north shore, at the narrowest part between the two project-
ing head-lands, forming the entrance.)
On being well w'ithin the entrance, haul up ; for if a
stranger, and no pilot on board, it is better to come to anchor
in Nelson’s bay. The channel, in passing up the outer
harbour towards the inner, is near the south shore; a large
extent of the north side being shoal water, occasioned by the
sands ejected from the Myall river.
Passing on either side the island, and being then within
the inner harbour, a ship of from three to four hundred tons
burthen, cannot proceed nearer the Company’s settlement
than w ithin a mile and a half off JF?epi point, where she can
discharge her cargo into lighters.
Vessels of smaller class can reach within the Magonehay
island; and those only drawing five feet water can reach the
Company’s wharfs.
There is secure anchorage for large vessels, for refitting
and watering, in the coves of this harbour. I can thus con-
fidently assume, that the harbour of Port Stephens can be
safely entered, in almost every wind, by ships of the largest
class ; and that any merchant vessel, not drawing more than
three and a half fathoms water, can proceed within a mile of
the Company’s settlement. A direct trade with England
must, very soon, take place ; the great activity and means
already in operation, with the splendid capital still purposed
to he vested by the Company, must ensure through them
alone a very considerable commerce. It is the desire of Mr.
Dawson, the Company’s Agent in the Colony, that the Di


rectors in London will cause their outward-bound ships to
be cleared direct for Port Stephens, instead of Port Jackson;
and this arrangement has, ere now, in all probability, been
made. With this object, I understand, it was his intention
to establish a skilful pilot for the port, and to erect a signal
station on one of the promontories at the entrance, to tele-
graph to the settlement when a vessel is approaching the
harbour.
The entrance to Port Stephens may be known from the
two small islands off it; the land, both to the north and
south of its entrance, rising in broken and abrupt slopes, from
the shores, to a considerable elevation, and terminating in
blunted cones; —that of the south being nearer a regular
cone than that on the north side.
Several conical hills can also be seen, from two to four
miles back, {south-west to south,) from the land alluded to
on the south side. The promontory of the north side is iso-
lated, a low shore and sandy beach commencing immediately
to the north of it, and thence extending many miles.
REID'S MISTAKE
Is situated fourteen and a half miles to the south-south-west
of Port Hunter, and so called in honor of its discoverer,
whose name was “ Reid,” being master of a colonial coast-
ing vessel, and intending to run into Port Hunter, whither
colonial craft then resorted for coals, which were dug out
of the cliff by their crews; instead of Port Hunter, this
sagacious seaman took his bark into this opening, and thus,
in memory of his error, the name has been given.
The entrance to Reid’s Mistake is unfortunately obstructed
by a bar, so as to prevent the access of any vessels but those
of the smallest class, there not being more than from five
and a half to six feet on the bar at high-water. This is also
the entrance into Lake Macquarie, a spacious and interesting
sheet of water; the banks of which, on being occupied, will
G


cause a small-craft intercourse coastwise between this place
and Port Hunter, a distance which can always be accom-
plished in three or four hours.
Larger vessels can, however, lay under the island off the
entrance, and load or unload from or into lighters. The
banks of Lake Macquarie are yet but very partially occu-
pied ; on the south side of the lake the Government have
engaged to grant 10,000 acres of land to the London Mis-
sionary Society, in trust for the aboriginal natives, and
which society have formed an establishment there, under the
direction of the Rev. —. Threldkeld, with a view of instruct-
ing the natives, and preaching to them in their own language.
On the lands thus allotted, on the shore of the lake, has
recently been discovered Kendal coal, being the first of that
class yet known in the colony, which is of a superior quality,
and will meet with a demand in Sydney: a trade in this
article may, therefore, in a short time be calculated upon.
ROADS.
In this part of the colony, which has only had the benefit of
colonization and improvement since the latter part of the
year 1822, the roads are in as forward a state as the public
can reasonably expect.
The Governors, Generals Macquarie, Brisbane, and Dar-
ling, have each pursued a very liberal and praiseworthy
policy, in causing a great body of convicts to be constantly
employed in the opening and making of roads, in every part
of the colony. Two routes across a tract of country, (the
Blue Mountains,) which, for many years, was considered a
boundary to the inhabitable lands, and which was a barrier
to the colonist’s industry, (the one south-west, near 200
miles from Sydney, and that westerly to the Bathurst country,)
were made accessible to carriages, under the direction of the
venerated Governor Macquarie. Governor General Sir Tho


mas Brisbane caused a nearer route to be opened to the
Bathurst country; and also used a considerable force in the
improvement of the roads on the M £ Adam system, which had
before been but imperfectly made.
With respect to that part of the colony immediately under
my consideration, General Darling appears to have viewed
the necessity and policy of employing convict labour in the
making of roads, in the same light as his predecessors; and
has recently directed the labour of upwards of 100 men, under
able managers, to the opening of a direct carriage tract, (also
crossing the Blue Mountain range,) from Sydney into the
Hunter’s river country, which is already considerably
advanced; and which there is every probability of being
made complete in the next eighteen months.* The neces-
sity, however, for making roads in those parts of the colony
under settlement, is not urgent, the country generally being
so open, and presenting so few difficulties, that it seldom
happens but that a loaded carriage can be taken to any
required point. The method adopted in first pursuing a
route into any distant country is this :—The first settler, or
party of settlers, proceeding with their men, teams, and bag-
gage into any new and distant country, having, as is usual,
before made a journey to such, and having obtained every
information the Crown surveyors of the district can give, he
or they, on entering upon the journey, keep two or three
men following the carts, and with axes mark the trees, by
fractures in the bark, denoting the route the carriages pur-
sue. This done, the settler’s men can proceed back with the
teams, and get up their second loadings without any appre-
hension of losing the road; and thus, in a short period,
the tract is so beaten, (some improvements to the right and
left being occasionally made,) as to be designated the road;
and is frequently used as such, without any repair, for a

road,) is proceeding with great activity.

great number of years. This, indeed, is the description of
roads in general use in New South Wales, before it is made
to appear to the Government, through the representation or
memorial of those concerned, that the traffic and commerce
of any neighbourhood require the route being scientifically
laid off, and the road properly formed and metaled.
The making of roads is first necessary, therefore, when a
barren and mountainous tract intervenes, so as to prevent
the intercourse between the capital town or port of shipment
and the country in which products are raised. In such
routes, rocks have to be cut away and removed; mountains
zig-zagged; jungles cut through; and bridges thrown across
ravines, &c. In short, nothing but the great command of
labour which the Government of the colony has had, could
have caused this, in the history of colonies, to have made
such prodigious strides, and opened such grand channels to
industry and wealth, as the colonists now enjoy, in the pas-
tures and soil of the western countries.
However great the necessity for road making, and however
great the liberality of Government has been, I cannot hope,
nor do I think that the public can expect, it will continue.
It must be recollected, that until a late period, the number
of convicts transported to New South Wales has very far
exceeded the demand of settlers for their labour, when the
Government could not better employ a portion of the super-
fluous mass, nor be better adding to the national prosperity,
than by making roads.
But the contrary now is the fact. Through the emigra-
tion which has taken place within the last few years, and the
consequent introduction of capital, the demand for convict
labour does now, and will, (without a mistaken policy is
pursued, tending to stop emigration,) whatever is the increase
of crime in Britain, exceed the number transpgrted. Thus,
as every able-bodied man who arrives in New South Wales,
can be maintained without any expense to the state, it fol


lows, therefore, as being unreasonable, that an expense of ten
thousand pounds per annum, (say 500 men at £2O each per
annum, which is far under the number now actually em-
ployed,) should be incurred by the British nation, in making
turnpike roads for her subjects in New South Wales. The
road making should certainly continue, under the manage-
ment of Government, and they should contribute a quota
towards it; but, in order that the public may equally con-
tribute with the Government, estimates of the actual expense
incurred upon any line of road, should be regularly sub-
mitted, and a toll established: the "Government receiving
five per cent, per annum on about two-thirds of the sum
vested in the employ and support of the convicts. In taking
a prospective view upon this part of the affairs of the colony,
I apprehend the day is not distant when Government will
decline to support the cost and management of cutting new
roads; and that it will be done, as in the mother country,
by trustees, or joint-stock companies, assisted, if occasion
should require, by loans from the Crown.
Besides the road I have already spoken of, as being now
in progress; that leading from King’s Town to Morpeth, has
been some time in hand; but latterly (it is said to be
through the want of men) the work has been abandoned.
The tract northward to Port Stephens was marked by my-
self, in March, 1826, with a view to enable the Company to
proceed with the stock to their lands. This road is not fit
for carriages in its present state; it is, however, the best
line that can be taken in crossing the waters of the Hunter,
Carrington, and Larpent rivers, where such are fordable.
The better road to the Company’s settlement, will be that
given on the map, more to the east, crossing the Hunter by
a ferry boat, (and punt for cattle,) just below the junction of
the Hunter And William rivers, and the Carrington also in the
same manner; the adoption of this route is, I understand,
contemplated by the Agent, as soon as the necessary boats
and punts can be prepared.

THE
CONDITIONS AND RULES
Upon which Lands are granted and sold by the Crown,
In New South Wales,
COMMENCING WITH GENERAL DARLING’S GOVERNMENT.
WITH OBSERVATIONS THEREON.
The following regulations, numbered 1, were issued from
the office of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in No-
vember, 1824, and were put into every emigrant’s hand on
his leaving England for the colony, up to the early part of
1827, as containing the express conditions on which he was
to receive his lands on arrival. Numerous grants are, there-
fore, held under those conditions, including many given on
my map. Although they are now abrogated by new rules,
issued from the Secretary of State’s office, yet, being, in my
estimation, well adapted to encourage emigration, to satisfy
emigrants, and to further the interest of the colony, I give
them a place. The regulations No. 2, were published by
the local Government in the colony. With a view of super-
ceding those numbered 1. Those numbered 3 are the con-
ditions now acted upon, (March, 1828,) being founded upon
those of General Darling, No. 2; and the residue are local
regulations, published in the colony, and inserted in the
order as published.
The lands ordered to be granted in the colony from the
19th of May, 1825, to the sth of September, 1826, are under”
the regulations No. 1 ; those granted from the sth of Sep-
tember, 1826, to the period of the arrival in the colony of
the regulations No. 3, (about August, 182/,) are under the
conditions No. 2; and those granted subsequently to the last
named period, under the regulations. No. 3.

« REGULATIONS FOR LAND,
“ For the information of persons proceeding to New South Wales and Van
Diemen’s Land as settlers, it has been deemed expedient to prepare the following
summary of the Rules which his Majesty’s Government have thought fit to
lay down for regulating the Grants of Land in that Colony:—
“ 1. A division of the whole territory into counties, hundreds, and parishes,
is in progress. When that division shall be completed, each parish will com-
prise an area of about twenty-five miles., A valuation will be made of the
lands throughout the Colony, and an average price will be struck for each
parish.
“ 2. All the lands in the Colony not hitherto granted, and not appro,
priated for public purposes, will be put up to sale at the average price thus
fixed.
; “3. All persons proposing to purchase lands, must transmit a written appli-
cation to the Governor, in a certain prescribed form, which will be delivered
at the Surveyor General’s office to all parties applying, on payment of a fee
of two shillings and sixpence.
« 4. All correspondence with the Local Government, respecting grants of
1 land, must take place through the same office.
“5. The purchase-money is to be paid by four quarterly instalments. A
discount of ten per cent will be allowed for ready money payments,
“ 6. On payment of the money, a grant will be made in fee simple to the
purchaser, at the nominal quit rent of a pepper com.
“ 7. The largest quantity of land which will be sold to any individual, is
9,600 acres. The lands will generally be put up to sale in lots of three square
miles, or 1,920 acres. Persons wishing to make more extensive purchases,
must apply to the Secretary of State, in writing, with full explanations of their
objects and means.
“ 3. Any purchaser, who, within ten years after his purchase, shall, by the
employment and maintenance of convicts, have relieved the public from a
charge equal to ten times the amount of the purchase-money, will have the
purchase-money returned, but without interest. It will be computed that, for
each convict employed and wholly maintained for twelve months, £l6 have
been saved to the public.
’ “9. Lands may also be obtained without purchase, but upon different con-
ditions.
« 10. Persons desirous to become grantees without purchase, will make
their application to the Governor, in writing, in a prescribed form; copies of
which are to be obtained at the Surveyor General’s office, on payment of two
shillings and sixpence.
“11. The largest grant that will be made, without purchase, is 2,560 acres.
The smallest, 320 acres,
« 12, No grant is to be made to any person without purchase, unless the
Governor is satisfied that the grantee has both the power and the intention of
expending in the cultivation of the lands a capital equal to half the estimated
value of it.
“ 13. A quit rent of five per cent, per annum upon the estimated value*
will be fixed upon the land granted without purchase.
“ 14. The quit rent will be redeemable within the first twenty-five years
next following the grant, on payment of a sum equal to twenty times the
annual amount of it.
“ 15. In the redemption of his quit rent the grantee will have credit for


one-fifth part of the sums which he may have saved to his Majesty’s Go-
vernment, by the employment and maintenance of convicts, and for the
purpose of making this allowance. It will be calculated that the Government
has saved £l6. for each convict employed by the grantee, and wholly main-
tained at his expense on his land for one whole year.
“ 16. Until the expiration of the first seven years next succeeding each
grant without purchase, no quit tent will become due upon the lands com-
prised in it.
“ 17. Every grantee without purchase, must, at the expiration of the before-
mentioned time of seven years, prove to the satisfaction of the Surveyor
General, that he has expended in the cultivation and improvement of his land,
a capital equal to half its value, as that valuation was estimated at the time of
his grant. On failure of such proof the land will be forfeited to the Crown.
“ 18. No additional grant of land will be made to any person who has not
proved, as last mentioned, the necessary expenditure of capital on the lands
already granted to him.
“ 19. Persons receiving a second grant of land, without purchase, will
become liable to pay a quit rent upon the lands comprised in such second
grant, immediately from the date of it.
“ 20. Persons desirous to receive grants of land without purchase, on terms
different from those above stated, must lay before the Secretary of State a full
explanation, in writing, of the circumstances which they may conceive to
exempt them from the fair operation of these general rules.

“GOVERNMENT ORDER.
“ Colonial Secretary's Office, Sept. 5, 1826.
“ REGULATIONS FOR THE GRANTING AND SALE OF LAND.
“ His Excellency the Governor is pleased to notify, that the following regu-
lations, in furtherance of his Majesty’s instructions for the disposal of land,
have been established, until his Majesty’s pleasure shall be known.
“ 1. Persons desirous of obtaining land, will address themselves to the Colo-
nial Secretary, who will furnish them with the established form of application.
When the Governor shall be satisfied of the character and respectability of
the applicant, the Colonial Secretary will be instructed to furnish him with
a letter to the Land Board, in order that the amount of capital which he can
command may be ascertained. Stock of every description, implements of
husbandry, and other articles which may be applicable to agricultural purposes,
are to be considered as capital, as likewise any half-pay or pension, which the
applicant may receive from Government.
“ 2. The Land Board will carefully investigate the particulars of the capital
which the respective applicants are stated to possess; it being of importance
that settlers should not receive a greater extent of land than they are capable
of improving, and, that grants should not be made to persons who are desirous
only of disposing of them. The regulations fixing the period within which
persons receiving grants without purchase will not be allowed to alienate the
lands, (without subjecting themselves to a forfeiture of the grants,) will be here,
after notified.


“3. When the Governor is satisfied as to the amount of capital possessed by
the applicant, the latter will be furnished by the Colonial Secretary with a
letter to the Surveyor General, who will afford him every necessary informa-
tion, and will give him a written authority (for which he will pay a fee of
2s. 6d.) to proceed in search of land.
“ 4. When he has made his selection, he will apprise the Surveyor General
by letter, who will point out in his report, (to be transmitted twice a month for
the Governor’s information,) the situation, &c. of such lands as have been
selected. If approved by his Excellency, the Colonial Secretary will give the
applicant a written authority to take possession of land (in which the condi-
tions will be specified,) until his Majesty’s pleasure be known, or the grant be
made out.
“ 5. The following boundaries have been fixed, within which persons who
may be allowed to purchase or to receive grants, on paying an annual quit
rent, will be permitted to make their selection.
The Northern Boundary to be from Cape Hawke, in a line due west to Wel-
lington Valley,
The Western Boundary to be the river Macquarie, from Wellington Val-
ley to the 33d parallel of latitude, from thence the line to be extended to the
148| degree of east longitude, and from that point directly south until itreaches
the river Lachlan; thence due east to Campbell’s’ River, pursuing the line of
that river to the southward, and so on to the latitude of Bateman Bay, which
forms the Southern Boundary.
“ 6. The Government will reserve for its own use, 10,000 acres in the
immediate neighbourhood of the settlement at Bathurst, which the Surveyor
General will make out without loss of time, so that settlers may not be im-
peded in selecting their land.
“ 7. Land granted without purchase, to beheld in free and common socage,
the grantee paying a quit rent of 5 per cent, per annum, on the value to be
fixed by the Commissioners.
“ 8. The payment of the quit rent not to commence until the end of seven
years, after the grantee has been authorised to settle on the land.—Within
that period, however, the grantee must expend in improvements on the land
so granted, a sum equal to one-fourth of the value estimated by the Commis-
sioners, under the penalty of forfeiting the grant.
“ 9. The quit rent to be redeemable at the option of the grantee, on pay.
ment into the Colonial Treasury of a sum equal to 20 years’ purchase, provided
such payment be made within 20 years after the date and execution of the
grant.
“ 10. Lands to be granted in square miles, in the proportion of one square
mile, or 640 acres for every £5OO sterling of capital, which the applicant can
immediately command, to the extent of four square miles, or 2560,acres, which
is the utmost extent. The Crown reserves to itself the right of making and
constructing such roads and bridges, as may be necessary for public purposes
on lands to be granted as above; and also, to such indigenous timber, stone,
and other materials, the produce of the land, as may be required for making
and keeping the said roads and bridges in repair.
“11. The land selected by individuals who have obtained leave to purchase,
will be valued by the Commissioners, with as little delay as possible, and will
be put up to sale for one month, (by proclamation,) as directed by his
Majesty’s instructions, and will not be sold at a lower rate, than the value so
fixed.
« 12. Sealed tenders, for the purchase of the land advertised as above, to be
addressed under cover to the Colonial Secretary, and marked, ‘ Tender for land?
At the end of a month, from the date of the proclamation, the tenders will be


opened in the presence of such persons as the Governor may appoint; when
the land will be disposed of, as directed by his Majesty’s instructions, to the
person making the highest tender, if approved of by the Governor. Lands
purchased, will be held in free and common socage, paying a yearly quit rent
to the Crown, of one pepper com.
“ 13. The purchaser will be required to deposit ten per cent, of the pur-
chase money, previously to his receiving possession of the land, and the sale
will be confirmed by the necessary instrument when the present arrangement
shall be approved by his Majesty.
“ 14. No person will be permitted by any contract, or succession of con-
tracts, to become the purchaser of more than 9,600 acres, including the land
he may have previously purchased, unless duly authorised by a special order
from the Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.
“ 15. The personal residence of individuals on the land which they may
obtain by grant or purchase; or the employment, on the spot, of a free man
of approved character and respectability, wilbbe made an indispensable con-
dition.
“16. Persons desirous of obtaining “ reserves of land,” or “ grants in exten-
sion,” will make application in the prescribed form, through the Colonial
Secretary; and, if no objection exists, the Governor will authorise them to
occupy the land they may ‘make choice of, until his Majesty’s pleasure be
known, on their engaging to pay rent in the mean time, at the rate of one
pound sterling per annum for every 100 acres.

“TERMS UPON WHICH LAND IS GRANTED TO SETTLERS,
“ In New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land.
“ For the information of persons proceeding to New South Wales and Van
Diemen’s Land, as settlers, it has been deemed expedient to prepare the follow-
ing Summary of the Rules which his Majesty’s Government have thought fit
to lay down, for regulating the grants of land in those colonies.
“ 1. A division of the whole territory into counties, hundreds, and parishes,
is in progress. When that division shall be completed, each parish will com-
prise an area of about 25 miles. A valuation will be made of the lands
throughout the colony, and an average price will be struck for each parish.
“ 2. All the lands in the colony not hitherto granted, and not appropriated
for public purposes, will be put up to sale, at the average price thus fixed, or
be granted to settlers upon other conditions.
“ 3. Until a survey and valuation of the whole of the lands shall have taken
place, persons desirous of purchasing, as well as those who wish to obtain lands
without purchase, will have the permission of selecting their land within certain
prescribed limits, and the land which they may so select will be surveyed and
valued as soon as practicable, and be sold or be granted under quit rent,
according to the option of the settler.
“ 4. All persons proposing to purchase lands, must transmit a written appli-
cation to the Governor, in a certain prescribed form, which will be delivered
at the Surveyor General’s office, to all persons applying, on payment of a fee of
two shillings and sixpence. ,

will be valued by the Commissioners with as little delay as possible, and will
be put up to sale for one month (by proclamation), and will not be sold at a
lower rate than the value fixed.—Sealed Tenders for the purchase of the land
advertized, as above, to be addressed under cover to the Colonial Secretary,
and marked * Tender for Land.' —At the end of the month, from the date of
the proclamation, the tenders will be opened in the presence of such persons as
the Governor may appoint, when t the land will be disposed of to the person
making the highest tender, if approved by the Governor.
“ 6. All correspondence with the local Government, respecting grants of
land, must take place through the office of the Surveyor General, in the same
manner as is prescribed in regard to the land which the parties may be de-
sirous of purchasing.
“ 7. A deposit of 10 per cent, upon the whole value of the purchase to be
paid down, the remainder to be paid half-yearly by promissory notes, payable
at such intervals of time, and under such regulations as may be agreed upon
by the Governor.
“ 8. On payment of the money, a grant will be made in fee simple to the
purchaser, at fhe nominal quit rent of a pepper com.
“ 9. The largest quantity of land which will be sold to any individual, is
9,600 acres. The lands will generally be put up to sale in lots of three square
miles, or 1920 acres. Persons wishing to make more extensive purchases,
must apply to the Secretary of State in writing, with full explanation of their
object and. means.
“ 10. Lands may also be obtained without immediate purchase, but upon
different conditions.
“11. Persons desirous to become grantees without immediate purchase, will
address themselves to the Colonial Secretary, who will furnish them with the
established form of application. When the Governor shall be satisfied of the
character and respectability of the applicant, the Colonial Secretary will be in-
structed to furnish him with a letter to the Land Board, in order that the
amount of capital which he can command may be ascertained. Stock of
every description, implements of husbandry, and other articles which may be
applicable to agricultural purposes, are to be considered as capital, as likewise
any half-pay or pension which the applicant may receive from Government.
“ 12. The Land Board will carefully investigate the particulars of the capi-
tal which the respective applicants are stated to possess, it being of importance
that settlers should not receive a greater extent of land than they are capable of
improving, and that grants should not be made to persons who are desirous of
disposing of them. The regulations fixing the period within which persons
receiving grants, without purchase, will not be allowed to alienate the lands
(without subjecting themselves to a forfeiture of the grants) will be hereafter
notified.
“ 13. When the Governor is satisfied as to the amount of capital pos.
sessed by the applicant (who must have the power of expending in the culti-
vation of the lands, a capital equal to one-fourth part of their estimated value
at the least) the latter will be furnished by the Colonial Secretary with a letter
to the Surveyor General, who will afford him every necessary information, and
will give him a written authority, for which he will pay a fee of 2s. 6 d. to
proceed in search of land.
“ 14. When he has made this selection he will apprise the Surveyor General
by letter, who will point out in his report (to be transmitted twice a month
for the Governor’s information) the situation, &c. of such lands as have been
selected. If approved by the Governor, the Colonial Secretary will give the
applicant a written authority to take possession of the land (in which the con-
ditions will be specified) until the grant be regularly made out.


“ 15. The largest grant that will be made to any fresh settler without pur-
chase, is 2,560 acres—the smallest 320 acres.
“ 16. Lands to be granted in square miles, in the proportion of one square
mile, or 640 acres, for every £5OO sterling of capital, which the applicant can
immediately command, to the extent of four square miles, or 2,560 acres,
which is the utmost that can be granted without purchase. The Crown re-
serves to itself the right of making and constructing such roads and bridges as
may be necessary for public purposes, on lands to be granted as above; and
also to such indigenous timber, stone, and other materials, the produce of the
land, as may be required for making and keeping the said roads and bridges
in repair, or of compelling the proprietor, after a certain period, to construct
roads through his own property, or to contribute either by money payments,
or by work performed, towards an object so desirable.
“ 17. A quit rent of 5 per cent, per annum upon the value of each grant
of land, as estimated in the survey, will be levied on all such grants ; but such
quit rent will not commence to be levied, until the expiration of the first seven
years next succeeding the issue of such grant. At the expiration of the above
mentioned seven years the grantee will become possessed in feq, simple of the
grant, subject to the payment of the quit rent, or he will be entitled to redeem
such quit rent, if he prefer that alternative.
“ 18. The quit rent will always be redeemable at twenty years’ purchase;
the power of such redemption commencing at the termination of the first seven
years, when such quit rent is first levied.
“ 19. Every grantee without purchase must, at the expiration of the before-
mentioned term of seven years, prove, to the satisfaction of the Surveyor Ge-
neral, that he has expended in the cultivation and improvement of the land, a
capital equal to one-fourth of its value, as that value was estimated at the time
of his grant; on failure of such proof, the land will be forfeited to the Crown.
“ 20. No additional grant of land will be made to any person who has not
proved, as last mentioned, the necessary expenditure of capital on the lands
already granted to him, and that he has sufficient capital in hand to enable
him to cultivate to advantage the additional grant for which he applies.
“ 21. Persons receiving a second grant of land, without purchase, will be-
come liable to pay a quit rent upon the lands comprised in such second grant,
immediately from the date of it; but any grantee who can show an expendi-
ture of capital upon his first grant, to the amount of five times the estimated
value of that grant at the time of its being made to him, will be entitled to a
further grant, with a reduction in his quit rent at the rate of 21 per cent.; on
the estimated value of such grant, on proving that he has sufficient capital still
in hand to cultivate to advantage the additional grant.
“ 22. The same regulation will apply to purchasers of land who may make
application for a second purchase, and who can show that they have laid out
capital upon such land to five times the amount of its estimated value. In
such a case, half the estimated value of the new land will be remitted.
“ 23. Persons desirous to receive grants of land without purchase, on terms
different from those above stated, must lay before the Secretary of State,
through the Governor of the Colony, if resident there, a full explanation in
writing of the circumstances which induce them to claim exemption from the
operation of these general rules
“ 24. The personal residence of individuals on the land which they may
obtain by grant or purchase, or the employment on the spot of a free man, of
approved character and respectability, will be made an indispensable condi-
tion.”

REMARKS ON THE FOREGOING ORDERS.
I shall now proceed to review these Regulations, and
endeavour to point out such parts as are incompatible with
the interests of the state, and contradictory to the feeling
expressed by his Majesty’s Government.
I shall only remark upon such paragraphs of each con-
dition as appear to me deserving particular attention.
No. I.
These conditions were deserving great commendation, and,
I fear, their suspension is to be attributed to an appear-
ance of too great liberality.
Paragraphs 11 and 12 were exceedingly liberal, and in
effect annulled an old regulation, which ordained. That no
emigrant settler, but he who possessed a capital of £5OO,
should receive a grant of land in New South Wales. The
conditions laid down no other scale of capital necessary to
he possessed by the settler, than is here provided for.
It cannot be supposed that the intention of Government was
to require the possession of a greater capital than here re-
quired to be expended; thus, supposing the estimated value
of land in the colony to be five shillings per acre, the value
of 2560 acres would be £640; and that of 320 acres, £80;
and, therefore, as the scale of capital is hereby defined,
by the settler being required to vest in the improvement of
the land granted to him, a capital equal to one-half of its
estimated value : it follows, that he who was possessed of and
intended to vest £320, (more or less, as the value of the
land might exceed, or not, five shillings per acre,) was
entitled to the larger grant of 2560 acres; and he who
possessed only £4O, was entitled to the smaller grant of 320
acres.


Paragraph 13.—The quit rent, as here fixed, of five per
cent, per annum upon the estimated value of the land, is very
high ; a liberal provision is, however, made to enable the
settler to redeem it.
Paragraph 15 provides for the redemption of the quit
rent; every bona fide settler, by being credited at the rate of
£3. 4s. per annum for every convict maintained by him,
will find it to his interest to employ such a number, as will
in a short time balance with the Crown the conditioned sum
for the redemption of his quit rent. The residue, (if any,)
to the settler’s credit, will, of course, contribute to the re-
turn of purchase money, paid for any lands he may have
purchased, agreeably to the terms of paragraph 8.
Paragraph 17 provides against imposition, and insures
the fulfilment of the terms upon which grants were originally
ordered, under the conditions of paragraphs 11 and 12.
No. 11.
These conditions issued by the local Government in the
colony, are now susperseded by No. 3, from Downing
Street, in which are included the terms of No. 2. My
remarks upon the existing conditions will also apply to this.
No. 111.
Paragraphs 1 and 2 allude to the preliminary object of
survey, valuation, &c.
Paragraph 3 orders, that persons desirous of purchasing,
or receiving land by grant, will be allowed to select it
“ within certain prescribed limitssuch limits doubtless
are those described in General Darling’s regulations. No. 2,
paragraph 5.
Much difficulty will be found by settlers, in selecting their
lands, under this rule, without the Government mark the
imaginary lines here described. If this is not done, the set-
tler, in his perigrinations, must be at a loss to know whether
a 2


he is travelling within, or not, this line of demarcation,
and consequently will risk the loss of much time.
The better plan, in my estimation, is to allow settlers to
proceed to the interior for their locations, so far as their
perseverance will lead them; thus the enterprize of one
settler, would often induce twenty others to follow him to
the most distant parts of the colony. The only objection to
this must be, the arrears of survey and the want of sur-
veyors ; this, however, under proper management, can be
easily got over.
Paragraphs 4 to 10 are explicit, and nearly in effect the
same as those that were originally issued from Downing
Street, November, 1824. In paragraph 5, a great power is
given to the Governor in the words, “ when the land will be
disposed of to the person making the highest tender, if
approved by the Governor.” In the sale of Crown pro-
perty, I have always understood, that the highest offer is
received.
Paragraphs 11, 12, 13, and 14, provide various forms of
office for the settler to wade through, all copied from the
rules of General Darling, No. 2, However assiduous the
settler may be, he will find that the getting through the
careful investigation of the Land Board, with the other
forms, will occupy his attention a considerable time. The
13th paragraph makes it obligatory on the settler to expend,
in the cultivation of land granted him, a capital equal to
one-fourth part of its estimated value.
This condition is of very easy accomplishment, and as
regards the required expenditure of capital, is one half
less than that required by the 12th and 17th paragraphs of
the King’s regulations. No. 1. The value of lands is ex-
pected to average about five shillings per acre; at that sum,
the person receiving 1280 acres, or two square miles, is only
required to effect improvements to the value of £BO.


Paragraph 16 provides a scale of capital, and the corres-
ponding number of acres which will be granted to every
settler. This condition appears in some measure at variance
Avith the provisions of the 13th paragraph, before alluded
to. Here the settler is required to possess £5OO, to
entitle him to receive 640 acres; whereas, from the terms
of the 13th paragraph, he is only required to expend one-
fourth of its value, being about £4O. The settler is thus
required to possess £5OO, but is only obliged to expend in
the improvement of his land £4O of that sum; and in that
ratio for larger amounts.
In the King’s regulations of November, 1824, the settler
was required to vest, in the improvement of the lands granted
to him, a capital equal to one half its value, (see para-
graph 12,) and, as no other scale of capital was then pro-
vided, it must have been the intention of such to grant the
number of acres corresponding with the settler’s capability to
expend a sum equal to the said one-half the value of the land
granted to him. The latter part of this paragraph lays down
a condition never before introduced, and which the settler
may consider as a rod, which at some period will cause him
pain. I allude to that “ compelling the proprietor, after a
certain period, to construct roads through his own property,
or to contribute, either by money-payments, or by work,”
&c. Here then the individual settler is liable to be called
upon, at an indefinite period, to construct roads for the public
convenience; or to contribute, (it does not appear at whose
discretion it is left,) an indefinite sum towards their con-
struction. The public, I agree, should contribute with the
Government, towards making the roads, but on a more
equitable plan than the present one.
Paragraphs 17 and 18, upon the subject of quit rent, are
nearly to the same effect as paragraphs 13 and 14 of the re-
gulations of November, 1824, differing, however, in one
particular. By the former conditions the quit rent is redeem


able at any period within the twenty-five years next follow-
ing the grant, —whereas, by the latter, it is “ always redeem-
able.”
Since I am writing on the subject of quit rent, I cannot
but remark, that, as now fixed, it is upon the settler exceed-
ingly heavy. The great inducement to emigration to our
colonies, it must he felt, is the idea of receiving a grant of
land in fee simple. This encouragement no longer exists,
or it is now brought to this small consideration, viz. the
remission of the quit rent for the first seven years; and,
after the expiration of that period, the land is bound to pro-
duce to the Crown a rent of five per cent, per annum upon
its original value.
This, of course, is an exorbitant rent, and greater than the
English rack-holder is paying at this moment; since a return
of three and a half and four per cent, is considered, hy the
English landed proprietor, sufficient. The settler, therefore,
after proceeding to the most distant of Britain’s colonies,
does not become a landed proprietor without purchasing, but
a tenant of the Crown. The sum necessary to redeem this
quit rent, at twenty years’ purchase, is precisely an equiva-
lent to the present purchase.
I have before remarked, that, in the regulations of
November, 1824, paragraph 15, a very liberal measure was
introduced, enabling the settler to redeem his quit rent, and
calculated, in a very satisfactory manner, to meet the heavy
rent here affixed.
This condition, it will be observed, is entirely omitted in
the present regulations, without the annual rent being abated
correspondingly. It was also omitted in General Darling’s
conditions. No. 2.
Paragraphs 19 and 20 relate to the settler’s expenditure of
capital on the land granted him, which has been before
remarked upon.
Paragraph 21.—Grants may be obtained by settlers of long


standing, under the provisions of this paragraph; but the
cases cannot be numerous wherein the grantee will vest in
improvement, a sum equal to five times the original value of
the land first granted to him.
No. IV.
This is the first of General Darling’s local orders on land
affairs ; here is nothing grievously unjust towards the public,
but a great deal of unnecessary form. The applications for
the selection of land, were, up to this time, always made to
the Surveyor General, who, of course, knowing whether the
positions applied for were appropriated or not, gave the appli-
cant an immediate reply. It now appears that the Surveyor
General is thdught not sufficiently responsible to perform
this duty, the application having to pass through three
offices : a hoard is to be convened, and two formal reports
made, before the settler can be made acquainted whether or
not the land he applies for is to be had.
No. V.
The duties of the Land Board appointed by this order arej
to investigate and report to the Governor upon the amount
of capital possessed by every emigrant settler applying for
land. This hoard, in executing the duties thus assigned to
them, have rendered themselves subject to a very deserved
animadversion, in pursuing a course of investigation ill in
accordance with the feelings of the public. To settlers
having their means in bullion, hank receipts, or letters of
credit, there cannot he much difficulty, such, of course, being
immediately available to farming purposes.
Settlers who are proceeding to the colony, often convey
their property out by making a shipment of British manu-
factured goods, possessing also their outfit of farming imple-
ments, building materials, slop clothing, &c. Upon the value
of the unsold goods, implements, &c. brought out by the set


lers, the great difficulty arises with the Land Board, from
their entering into painful discussions upon the value of the
property so brought, and too often curtailing (instead of
ruling in favour of the settler, as they ought to do) the real
value of it.
The settler must, therefore, feel prepared to undergo a
tedious investigation, to enable the Board to arrive at the
value of a few (perhaps) unimportant sundries. Where, I
would ask, does the necessity appear for such particular
scrutiny, in fixing the means of the settler to a fraction ?
For example,—suppose a settler to possess £5OO in articles
of property, the proceeds of which being intended to be
appropriated to farming purposes; and suppose he were
inclined, in his statement, (but, in the majority of cases, no
such inclination may he expected,) to add to its value, say,
twenty per cent., he would thus make his means appear
£lOO more than he really possessed. Now as £5OO is enti-
tled to 640 acres, he would receive about 120 acres more
than his right; which, being only a freehold to him during
the first seven years, he will only be benefitted for this dis-
honourable conduct by the remission of five per cent, per
annum upon the value of 120 acres for seven years, amount-
ing to about £1 10s. per year, or about £lO 10s. in total.
A sum which (even supposing the statement of the whole
mass of emigrants as unworthy of credit) is not a sufficient
inducement for them to avail themselves of the practice,
which the Land Board believe to exist and are so determined
upon checking.
No. VI.
The cancelling of the regulation of November 8, 1824,
became necessary, in order to carry into effect the new
regulations, No. 2.
It should not, however, have been forgotten, that every
claim which had been made under that regulation, should


have been satisfied. For example, A. B, and C. were
induced, in consequence of the bounty offered by Govern-
ment, to receive and maintain a greater number of convicts
than they otherwise would, and which, by the terms of the
cancelled regulation, must have been maintained for the pre-
ceding year, before the claim could be made. It follows,
therefore, as a benefit had been rendered to the Crown, who
had in return engaged to remunerate the settler in land, that
at the date of cancelling the regulation of November 8, 1824,
every claim then existing under that order should have been
satisfied. The persons to whom the Crown was thus indebted
were numerous, and not one of them, that I could discover,
(including those that had preferred their claims) was paid.
No. VII.
This order cancels the good and old regulation of granting
“ tickets of occupation,”
“ Tickets of occupation” (which were merely the Gover-
nor or Secretary’s written authority, allowing the temporary
occupation of distant and unsurveyed lands) had been granted
without fee or reward, to persons who possessed more stock
than their own lands would feed; it being justly considered
as a stimulus to enterprising individuals, to drive their flocks
and herds into the interior, and to be the pioneers in opening
new regions to speedy colonization; those occupancies
never being given but at the distance of from twenty to thirty
miles from where the regular survey and settlement of the
country had extended.
This new regulation is rendered futile in its operation from
this fact, that the present arrears of survey will require the
next two or three years to accomplish. Therefore it appears
an absurdity to talk of rent at per hundred acres, when the
government have it not in their power to extend the surveys
of the country to the places where these temporary occu-
pancies would be received.


The sequel may be predicted; nine-tenths of those who
require food for their flocks and herds will drive them
into the interior, without any previous negociation with
government regarding acres or rent; and those who may
express a desire to rent from 500 to 1000 acres each, will in
reality occupy many more. It however is not satisfactory to
him who respects the laws of his rulers, to witness his less
scrupulous neighbours feeding their flocks without molesta-
tion or expense, whilst he, payingthe stipulated rent, is subject
to compete with them in procuring the best pastures.
No. Fill.
This is merely inviting persons wishing to become pur-
chasers of land, to make their applications.
No. IX.
This order calls upon all persons having purchased lands,
or having received orders for grants, under the regulations of
Sir Thomas Brisbane, to select them within a given period.
There is something irreconcilably harsh in demanding
other terms regarding a contract than those under which
it was originally made.
Persons are not only required to select their grants by
purchase within a given period, but such as have received
orders for grants are desired “ to lay before the Land Board,
by the first of November next, satisfactory proof that they
possess the necessary means,” according to the scale of the
10th paragraph of order No. 2.
Thus settlers who had already proved to the satisfaction of
Sir Thomas Brisbane the amount of means they possessed,
and who, through the arrears of survey and consequent want
of information, had not yet been able to make their choice,
were again called upon to go through all the office forms,
multiplied as they were by the fastidiousness of the Land
Board, and, upon failure of producing the necessary means,
the order states, “ the authority will be considered as can


celled:” that is, the grants ordered to all persons by Sir
Thomas Brisbane, which this order applied to, and who,
from inability or want of inclination, did not enter into this
extra-official business, would he considered as having for-
feited their grants.
It must he readily conceded that this order is untenable
and unjust, causing in its operation not only an innovation
upon the rights of those who came within its provisions,
but a direct censure upon the official conduct of Sir Thomas
Brisbane.
No. X.
This order makes a local regulation in regard to the
method necessary to he observed by the settler in making his
selection, and which will he found by the public an incon-
venient measure.
For example, those parts of the colony under settlement
are from 150 to 300 miles from Sydney, at which place it is
known the Surveyor General’s office is situated. It is of
every day occurrence that parties of settlers are in the same
neighbourhood, pursuing the same object, that of examining
lands, and selecting their grants; these persons are conse-
quently rivals, in their respectively wishing to establish their
priority to any fertile, well-watered, or picturesque spot.
This priority, therefore, will rest with him who first reports to
the Surveyor General the spot he wishes to have 3 and thus a
system of racing is established, as he who can make the best
speed to the Surveyor General is the successful competitor.
This business was managed with much less form, and con-
sequently with much greater advantage to the public, in the
government of Sir Thomas Brisbane. Then, in every division
of countryunder colonization, was a resident Crown Surveyor,
to whom the settler brought a letter from the Surveyor Gene-
ral, authorising him (the surveyor) to allow the settler to
make choice and receive possession of the number of acres


ordered him. He could then procure every information on
the spot, instead of journeying for it to Sydney, as is now
the case, —make his selection, and having sent a return to
the Surveyor General, his business was completed. Thus
settlers have arrived and settled on their lands within a
fortnight; in which object they are now often occupied some
months.
No. XL
This order calls upon settlers to select the lands to be
assigned to them within a given period, which in most cases
can be done within the prescribed time; yet the order is in
its terms unaccommodating.
DESCRIPTION OF UNAPPROPRIATED LANDS,
AND GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES.
In continuing my description of unappropriated country,
I shall proceed in my observations from those made on the
parishes of Jedburgh and Roxburgh, being the uppermost or
most westward, whose boundaries are designed on the map.
The lands on the river Hunter itself, above where the
survey of the river is discontinued, so far as I or any other
have yet proceeded, do not present any eligible point towards
which the agriculturist or grazier can he directed. From the
north-west extremity of the lands of Mr. Macqueen on this
river, the country assumes a mountainous character, being in
many places rocky, with inaccessible ridges, extending (at
alternate sides) to the margin of the water, rendering access
(should there he any good country above, which I do not
believe to exist) for carriages or even beasts of burthen
impossible in its present state.
The next stream to the westward of the Hunter is Page’s
river, although the valley through which it runs is hounded
on the east and west by elevated ranges; the vale affords


much good country, thinly timbered, well watered, and pos-
sessing deep loam soils; being well adapted to every purpose
for sheep and dairy farming.
The positions in this valley which are most desirable, and
which are worthy the attention of settlers in pursuit of land,
I have marked thus (*) on the map. The upper parts of this
valley have also the advantage of being on the route from
Newcastle to Liverpool plains, which, crossing the dividing
range at the most accessible point, will I have no doubt
ultimately become a road of consequence.
The valley of Kingdon Ponds, above where the locations
have extended, afford some well-watered and fertile positions;
besides, at the head, on the route towards Page’s river, is an
extensive space of fine grassy hill-country, well adapted for a
sheep pasture.
The next valley to the westward, whose waters also fall
into the Hunter, is that of Dart Brook: this valley, above
the locations given, is not more than from one mile to one and
a half broad; but in that space it affords a great abundance
of well-watered good pasture country, particularly adapted
to sheep grazing, of which the vale is capable of supporting
many thousands. There is a sufficient fall in the waters of
the Brook, towards its upper part, to allow of water-mills
for grinding grain, or other purposes.
From Dart Brook, crossing over the ridge, (which is here
low and easy of access,) by the present route, to the farms
of Messrs. Forsyth and Miller, you get into the country
where the vales of Kuwanggawa, Wirlaghn, and Lamorran,
are, running southward into the Goulburn and thence into
the Hunter rivers. In the former of these vallies, the settlers
whom I have just mentioned have selected their farms, and
were prosecuting their improvements with much perseve-
rance ; they fixed themselves in this secluded position with a
view of procuring a sale for grain through those neighbours
who, it was expected, would soon settle about and beyond


them. In this they have been disappointed, by this part of
the country being to the northward of General Darling’s
line of demarkation; consequently no emigrants are allowed
to establish themselves there. The settlers of the present day
may, however, calculate, that the confined limits of those
boundaries are by this time extended or do not exist at all.
The character of this division of country is a quick succes-
sion of fertile valleys, all taking their commencement near
the dividing range. In this district I compute there are full
ten miles square, or upwards of sixty thousand acres, of open,
dry, moderately elevated land, possessing herbage and soil
adapted to every farming purpose. As the rallies approach
the Goulburn, the country becomes broken and barren, ex-
cepting a small extent near the margin of the streams, which
affords some tolerable pasturage. This change in the quality
and aspect of the country takes place from the country
to the northward being of primitive structure, and that to
the southward being secondary; the former generally con-
sisting of whin, granite, porphery, and slate rock, and the
latter of sand, iron-stone, coal, &c. The division in the
country where these characteristics appear is given on the
map. The streams running through these vallies will also
afford sites for dams and artificial waterfalls, to be applied to
any machinery.
The next tract of country I shall describe is that through
which the Goulburn river runs. By the valley of this river,
the settlements upon the Hunter, and those extending north-
ward from the Bathurst country, are connected; many flocks
of sheep and herds of cattle having been already driven from
the latter to the former place. This river washing, as it does,
the northern basis of the Blue Mountain range, in some places
it appears in its course to have severed portions of these
barren hills, leaving only a chasm to mark its route. Its
proximity therefore to these ranges is the occasion of the
fertile lands on this river being of confined extent. The


uplands are generally barren and rugged, and the low or
alluvial lands (of which there is a continued chain on the
river, at alternate sides) are of a light sandy loam, wanting in
stamina and fertility, though in many places well adapted for
farms of from three to six hundred acres.
The most important district, however, and most worthy
the future settler’s attention, who is inclined to study the
growth of the following products, viz. fine wool, beef, pork,
ham, butter, cheese, tobacco, cotton for exportation, and
grain for the consumption of the neighbourhood, is Liverpool
plains. .
This division of country, discovered in 1818, by the Sur-
veyor General, Mr. Oxley, bordering upon and joining that
country which gives the sources to Hunter’s river, is beyond
all doubt the most extensive and fertile tract yet traversed
in the colony. In approaching this beautiful neighbourhood,
the traveller from the heights can well fancy himself viewing
an expansive ocean; —such is brought to his recollection on
first seeing these spacious plains, interspersed as they are
with clumps of trees and peninsulatedwood lands, combining
the most picturesque scenery with great fertility of soil.
In a country like New South Wales, intersectedwith exten-
sive craggy impassable ranges, and unfordable swamps, some-
times rendering the passage from one part to another a work
of considerable difficulty, I had great gratification in being
the first to discover the natural formation of the country at
the head of the Hunter to be highly favourable to an easy
access into this important district. Indeed, in the whole
distance by the route I pursued (that marked on the map)
from Morpeth, being the point of shipment on the Hunter,
to Liverpool plains (a distance of 105 miles), no hills or any
other obstacle intervened, to prevent the traveller on horse-
back or beast of burthen proceeding with the greatest facility,
and with very inconsiderable labor: the tract over the di-
viding range can be made accessible to laden carriages. The


settlements on the Hunter* it will be observed* already ex-
tend to within twenty-five miles of this district* of which the
greater part pass over a level and undulating country; the
only difficulty therefore is in the last few miles, on passing the
dividing range. From these circumstances* whenever the
Liverpool plain country becomes occupied, its products must
be brought to some place of shipment on the Hunter, which
will materially enhance the value of land upon that river* and
add considerably to the importance and trade of Port
Hunter.
In addition to my own view of this country, I can refer to
the valuable journal of Mr. Oxley, of his route, crossing it in
1818, and published in 1820, from which Wentworth, in his
Statistical Account of New South Wales (4th edit.) has
largely quoted. Neither of these writers was then acquainted
with the existence of a practicable route from Port Hunter to
the country in question.
In further elucidation of this point, I cannot refrain from
introducing a valuable paper which appeared in one of the
Sydney prints, taken from the notes of Mr. Cunningham,
botanical collector for Kew gardens; a gentleman who is
inferior only to our Surveyor General in possessing geogra-
phical knowledge of New South Wales, obtained through his
persevering travels, while pursuing his professional avoca-
tions.


GEOGRAPHICAL NOTES.
“ We have at this age of our colony acquired a more detailed and precise
acquaintance with the sinuous outline of the extensive and variously modi-
fied coasts of Terra Australis, than the cold broad sketch of its eastern shore, as
left us by Cook; or the more ancient, rude, and unconnected definitions of its
western coasts by Vlaming or Dampier could possibly furnish. The labours
of late years of a Flinders in completing the minutim and detail of geographical
science, and more recently those of King, in the equinoctial portions of our
continent, having pointed out to us the many amply sheltered recesses of those
shores, and their degrees of eligibility for the establishment of dependant intra-
tropical settlements.
Comparatively small however have been our advances towards the acquire-
ment of some just ideas of the physical, internal structure of this “ great south
land,” —the peculiar formation of those portions of our interior to which the
limited researches of Mr. Oxley have been extended, and the consequent absence
of navigable rivers, those important aids to extensive inland penetration,
seeming to have set a bound westerly to our geographical inquiries of the
country whose eastern shores we inhabit, and to have circumscribed our interior
view (some years past extended over a variously characterised surface, not
exceeding 450 geographical miles in breadth) to the longitude of 144. E.
about which meridian our Surveyor General had penetrated, in nearly the
parallel of our colony, so long back as 1817. In contemplating that physical
defect, the non-existence of internal navigable streams, it may be observed as
a singular fact, formerly remarked by Mr. Oxley and since confirmed by
others, that all the high lands of this southern continent are on, or no great
distance from its shores; the more elevated ranges appearing to occupy its
eastern coast, which they either immediately invest, or are to be observed inland
at a distance not exceeding 100 miles, lying generally north and south. These
meridional ranges of mountainous land, parts of whose extreme elevation above
the sea have been estimated at 6000 feet, give rise to and determine the courses
of the several streams that water and fertilize our expanding colony; those
that fall on their eastern side, after a brief existence, being discharged on the
coast we Inhabit, whilst those that descend in an opposite direction, meander
over some extent of declining country to the westward, until having fallen to a
seemingly internal level, the velocity of current acquired in their course
becomes arrested, and an extensive dispersion of these waters appears to take
place. Although our present limited knowledge does not fully warrant the
assertion that thus terminate our internal waters, there are nevertheless grounds
for such an apprehension, no high lands having been perceived to the westward
of the eastern verge of the marshes, and no river having been yet discovered
disemboguing itself on our eastern or southern coasts, whose general character
in the examination has shown an indication of distant origin in a communica-
tion with our interior swamps,—the recently discovered Brisbane river perhaps
excepted, which however can the more readily be supposed to be their eastern
outlet to the sea, upon the admission that the eastern country between the
parallels of 27. and 31. S. and easterly about to the meridian of 150. is one
continuous bog;—an extent of country too considerable to be thus character-
ised, in the present absence of that proof which is alone to be derived from an
examination. From the observations however that were made during the
progress of the important expeditions of Mr. Oxley in 1817 and 1818, we may
gather that a vast undefined portion of our interior regions is an inhospitable
level, in part subjected to continual inundation, by the several waters that
I


thereto flow from our Blue Mountain ranges; and thence are led to the con-
clusion, that not only the several western streams that were formerly intersected
and in part traced by our indefatigable Surveyor General, but also those of very
recent discovery by Messrs. Hovell and Hume in the parallels of 36. and 37. S.
which are stated to flow from eastern snow-capped mountains, towards the
west and north-west, and which were at their discovery respectively named
“ Hume’s,” “ Ovens,” and “ Goulbum’s rivers,” meet one common fate,*
namely, that of being dissipated over an uninterrupted plain of internal region;
—there being no opening on the south coast that we know of, by which the
three distinct streams that have been announced to us by those persevering
south-western travellers, can possibly make their escape to the sea.
If then an impassable morass occupies tracts yet undefined of our interior,
forbidding all penetration westerly beyond the meridian, to which penetration
has already been effected, our future joumies of discovery will doubtless be ex-
tended in a northerly direction. Thus a tour undertaken nearly on the meridian
of 150. E. north to the latitude of 27. S. would prove most interesting to geogra-
phical science, and highly important to a grazing community in our colony,
daily on the increase. To the one, the definition and extent northerly of the
great marshes above adverted to; the identity of any northern or north-eastern
outlet from them and the Brisbane; the origin of this latter stream, and the
ascertaining how far it is entitled to be considered other than a coast water; and
the general structure of the interjacent country; whilst to the other, such a
journey would prove a solid gain, by the disclosure of the extent of undulating
grazing lands which, from the elevated character of the country easterly of the
above meridian to the coast-line may be reasonably inferred to exist, north from
Liverpool plains to the confines of the country west from the shores of Morton
bay.
The existence of that spirit of inferior geographical inquiry which had, some
seven or eight years elapsed manifested itself, appears to have met with no
small check when the keen edge of curiosity was taken off, by the fatal, prema-
ture terminations of those then recently discovered promising western streams,
the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers, which by a wished for mutual confluence
were to have furnished an increase of magnitude sufficient to have formed a
deep groved channel through a vast depressed surface of our continent, to an
embouchure on the south coast, west of the meridian of 140. E. With the
exception of the late excursion to Western Port on the south coast, no journey
of any magnitude has been undertaken, since those above referred to; never-
theless certain enterprising individuals, whom leisure and circumstance have
favoured, have at various periods proceeded on minor tours, wherein they have
intersected previously untrodden tracts that widely separate certain distinctly
defined portions of our colonydetermining in their perambulations the value
and capabilities of the interjacent country they had traversed, as also some of
the geographical positions of its principal points; and what is not the least
important to the settler, have pointed out the direction in which a line of
practicable route could be opened to the districts they have visited. Small as
have been these individual exertions (compared with what an ample means in
the directing hands of talent and enterprise may ere long show of those distant
regions of our continent) over which the veil of obscurity at present hangs.
* It may tend not a little to strengthen the inference drawn of the presumed
terminations of those lately detected western waters, by observing that the point
at which the Hume river was intersected in November last by its discoverers,
does not exceed in distance 200 geographical miles from those very extensive
internal marshes that receive the waters of the Lachlan, which bearing from
their line of route N. W. is the exact direction in which this principal stream of
their journey (the Hume) was observed by them to flow.


still the little done in the way of advancing the knowledge of the geographical
positions of places, and thereby furnishing the materiel to embody the skele-
ton-chart of our diffusely settled colony, as well as the opening of the country,
■with a view of bringing in direct communication groups of settlers, till lately
■separated from each other by unknown unexplored tracts, and thereby showing
the local government in what direction its labours could be advantageously
bestowed in the construction of roads, are surely acts not unworthy of the
acknowledgments of a community otherwise actively and no less worthily
engaged in husbandry and grazing. It was in tours of this description that the
various country north from our western settlement, Bathurst, to that tributary
stream of the Macquarie, named the Cugeegang, and the Mudgee country
on its banks were discovered; and it was by a subsequent advancement on
that northern line of route that the country interjacent to Bathurst and Liver-
pool plains has become known, and their communication (as direct as the
structure of the country would admit) been opened to the grazier.
It will doubtless be remembered that Mr. Cunningham, the king’s botanical
traveller had, with considerable difficulty, in the winter of 1823, discovered a
passage through the lofty dividing mountainous ranges that separate the
Bathurst and Coal river countries from the extensive levels of Liverpool plains;
but that the reduced state of his provisions, and his distance from Bathurst did
not permit him to descend the pass to examine them at that particular period.
He has lately returned from an important botanical tour of twelve weeks in
those interesting regions; and the following epitome of his journey will mark
his plan of procedure; its outline, which has traced an extent of nearly 700
miles, forming on the chart a rhomboidal figure:—
Proceeding from Richmond north, on the present rugged and in part dan-
gerous track of Mr. Howe, he intersected Hunter’s river at Patrick’s plains in
100 miles; thence advancing N. W. up its stream about 40 miles, at which
distance its channel taking a bend from the N. E. he was induced to leave it,
in order to pursue his route to the westward, towards a singularly rounded
hill, named mount Dangar, whose elevated summit, overtopping the sur-
rounding country, forms a striking feature in the landscape of those regions.
Taking a fresh departure to the N. N. W. from mount Dangar, which is situate
in latitude 32. 18. 51. S. and longitude (reduced from the meridian of Rich-
mond) about 150. 27. 30. E., he at length in seventy miles intersected those
beautifully undulated tracts of sheep pasture formerly explored, and which are
bounded by the hilly country connected with the mountainous range, which
lying about east and west, forms the southern boundary of Liverpool plains,
and divides our eastern and western waters. At this stage of his journey he
crossed the parallel of 32. S. and identified (from an opposite approach) all the
principal points of the country, verifying generally the geographical observa-
tions he had made thereon in a former tour. Pursuing his journey west,- in
the parallel of 32. S., he crossed without difficulty a minor lateral range, which
is sheltered southerly from the main collection of mountains, and separates the
streams of the Coal river from those waters that fall into the Macquarie, par-
ticularly those that form its tributary rivulet, the Erskine of Mr. Oxley.
Thence continuing a westerly course about fifteen miles of interesting grazing
country, alternately plain and forest ridge, he intersected his former line of
route when on his return to Bathurst, from the pass he had then discovered
through the northern main dividing range to Liverpool plains.
This mountain gap, a defile which is situate almost under the meridian of
150. E. in latitude 31. 43. 30. S. and on his former tour marked his northern-
most point of penetration, he has now passed, descending on the 2d of May
last, with his pack-horse, on the south-western parts of Liverpool plains.
To give some idea of this passage thfough the mountains, it may be observed
i 2


that its approach from the Bathurst and Mudgee country is by a valley eight
miles in extent, which closes at its north-eastern extreme in the main ranges.
From the level of this valley (named formerly Hawkesbury vale) the acclivity,
through a rising open forest to the pitch of the pass, distant two miles, is
singularly gradual, considering the elevated points of the barrier range by
which it is bounded on either side; the northern declivity, although somewhat
less easy, being not more than a mile in length to the grazing forest at the foot
of the range, proving also very practicable; the entire pass from the head
of Hawkesbury vale to the bank of Bowen’s rivulet of Mr. Oxley, at the northern
base of the dividing range, and not exceeding three miles in extent, requiring
simply the well-directed hand of industry two or three weeks, in the construc-
tion of a few small bridges over the narrow but deep water channels grooved
by the rains, in order to permit the team of the grazier to pass northerly to the
extensive open country before him. As Mr. Cunningham had devoted a period
of three weeks to the examination of portions of these singularly featured regions
of our interior, and had penetrated to the northern part of Camden valley of
Mr. Oxley, in latitude 30. 47. S. in a line bordering on the above-mentioned
meridian from south to north, he is enabled to speak briefly of their feature,
presumed extent, capabilities, and value to the colonist.
Liverpool plains, which were discovered by Mr. Oxley in 1818, who entered
them on their north-western side upon emerging from our internal marshes,
are vast tracts of level pountry, comprehended between the meridians of 150.
and 150. 50. E. and within the parallels of 30. 45. and 31. 30. S. They are
disposed in elongated strips, which vary in breadth from five to ten or more
miles, for the most part clear of timber, with the exception of a few straggling
trees of acacia pendula, or weeping wattle, and eucalyptus mannifera, or white
gum, which are scattered singly at long distances on the general surface, one
uninterrupted patch of level plain (stretched from south to north) proving by
actual odometrical admeasurement to exceed fifty miles in extent, whilst another
portion crossing it from W. N. W. to E, S. E. and extending to the distant
part of the main dividing range, formed a base that could not be estimated at
less than fifty, and probably sixty miles. From these two principal branches
lateral ramifications stretch themselves north and south, of which the vallies
of Camden and Barrow are of the former direction; the ridges and rounded
mounts, which are remarked to interrupt the plane of the country, appearing
by these minor branches to be perfectly isolated, and thereby to form detached
elevations of various figure and picturesque appearance on the common level-
of the plains; whose entire area, admitting of its inclusion within the above-
mentioned meridional and parallel lines, will comprehend a million and a half
of acres; of which four-fifths may be considered, in seasons not decidedly wet,
available as rich and inexhaustible grazing lands for cattle; many dry situa-
tions on the acclivities of the detached rising grounds, and more especially
along the southern side of the plains in the immediate vicinity of the dividing
range, being perfectly beyond the reach of water (at a period when the level
lands are more or less subjected to a partial flooding by a rainy season) fur-
nishing healthful sound walks for sheep. . Those parts of Liverpool plains that
approach their westward wooded margin are watered by a stream,* which
originating in the dividing boundary range winds northerly through them, and
after a short course of fifty miles unites with the Yorke river; which latter
stream becoming governed by the obvious dip of the plains at N. N. W., makes
its escape to a singularly declining country at that point of bearing. We know
of no tract of timberless open country in New South Wales that (laying aside
its vast area) forms so nearly a level, as these remarkable lands of our interior;
* Bowen's rivulet of Mr. Oxley.


the natural consequence is, that ordinary rains falling on the southern mountains
cause an overflow of Bowen’s rivulet, and as their surface was observed to be
in many parts somewhat lower than the outer banks of this stream, the greater
portions of the north-western plain, and the whole of Camden valley,* together
with the boundary forest on the same level, are laid under water; of which fact
the wrecks of floods on the outer bank of the rivulet, the little pools in the
concavities of the general surface, the clodded nature of the surfa'ce-soil, and
consequent heaviness of travelling, together with the uniform rottenness of these
marginal forests, afforded an awful striking proof. Rising from these lower
sides of Liverpool plains over which Mr. Cunningham had prosecuted his
journey, and extending the view south-easterly, it was gratifying (whilst tra-
velling those less favorable portions) to the colonist to contemplate the undefined
extent of grazing lands, whose varied surface, whether of timberless inclined
plane, moderate undulation, or elevated detached ridge, appeared fully adequate
to the views of the grazier or agriculturist. Among the indigenous vegetation
of those parts of the plains that were traversed, the following European genera
of plants were particularly remarked; namely, a species of plantago, or rib
grass, scorzonera, or viper’s grass, lotus, or bird’s foot trefoil, contoured, or
centuary, ajuga, or bugle, campanula, or bell flower, accena, or burnet, rumex,
or dock, galium, or goose grass, epilohium, or willow herb, which were blended
with eight distinct species of grasses, among which a late danthonia, or gigantic
oafgrass was most remarkable.
The soil of those parts of the plains not liable to be flooded by any overflow
of Bowen’s rivulet, is of a rich loam, darkened by the fertilizing decomposition
of the trap-rocks, of which the high lands in the vicinity are formed. The
timber trees of the boundary ridges are stately sfringy-bark, box, and some
white gum; whilst those of the lower forests on the western skirls of the plains
are not only the two last kinds, but also iron-bark, and a species of callitris,
or cypress; which latter will doubtless be found fully applicable to most of the
purposes of rural economy. In a land whose interior unfortunately does not
afford us the means of a distant communication by navigable rivers, and con-
sequently where an expensive land carriage must ever be resorted to in the
conveyance of the produce of the interior to the coast; the ease or difficulty of
passing intermediate tracts of country, as well as the brevity or length of any
new line of route between one portion of country and another, will always be
matters of consideration and moment with the farmer, whose possessions and
stock are stationed in the interior, remote from our sea-port. To such it will
be interesting to learn that the distance from the settlement of Bathurst north
to Liverpool plains, by the way of Mudgee to the pass, is 160 miles; whilst
from Patrick’s plains on Hunter’s river, those extensive level tracts may be
visited by a remarkably easy line of country at N. W., through the same
mountain gap, in 140 miles: the route recently discovered by Mr. Dangar,
* Camden valley, which may be considered the north-western branch of the
Great plains, was found in the month of May last to be throughout its whole
extent of 25 miles exceedingly wet and boggy; and, as the dip of the country is
evidently at N. N. W. in the direction of the extreme parts of the vale, and not
only the Yorke river, but also certain partial drainings of the more considerable
south-eastern patches of plain (upon a somewhat higher level) are allowed slowly
to escape to a lower western country, the surface of the valley throughout Mr.
Cunningham’s last stage northerly towards Hardwicke’s range proved a perfect
mire, abundantly saturated with water, which could not escape by percolation,
the immediate sub-soil being a stiff tenacious clay. The plants of this part of
Camden valley are of those species that usually exist on lands constantly wet;
and as the surface of its lower or northern extreme was found covered with
water to the depth of ten or twelve inches, no douhtcan exist of the permanency
of its marshy character.


the indefatigable Surveyor of the Coal river (by which those extensive northern
plains are said to be entered considerably to the eastward of Mr. Cunningham's
tract) being possibly much shorter.
As much has been gleaned from a late lour (professedly of Botanical research)
of those tracts of our north-western country over which the party had travelled,
as will generally interest the farmer; and on the whole we may now say, that
our present knowledge of the interior has put us in possession of such an abun-
dant store of grazing lands, as will be at least more than doubly commensurate
to the aggregate number of acres at present in request, however considerable
may be the demands that have of late been made upon our unlocated lands, by
the proprietors of large grants; and, notwithstanding the applications of a
growing farming community, long since established in the colony, for further
stations to sustain its rapidly increasing stock, in the numerous requisitions of
European families, whom salubrity of clime, and the hopes of realizing in the
afternoon of life, a comfortable independence, have invited to our shores.”
By the latest accounts from the colony (November, 1827)
Mr. Cunningham had completed another interior journey to
the north, passing the dividing range by the Dart brook
route, and crossing Liverpool plains. In this journey Mr. C.
appears to have passed a great diversity of surface and soil,
including however a great portion of rich whin stone down
country, without timber, laying between the latitudes of 28°
and 29° S. The Australian report states :
“ In the parallel of mount Warning, theparty passed through a succession of fine
open forests and rich flats, the principal of which have been named by Mr. Cunning-
ham, Darling plains; 28,000 acres, without a tree, being eighteen miles long, and
two and a half to three broad, and watered in the middle by a chain of deep ponds.
Peel plains and Canning plains are of equal if not greater extent, but on account of
their greater breadth, and being partially wooded, do not present such a striking
appearance as these named after General Darling. A grander country can hardly
be conceived than what presents itself to the westward of the dividing range,
nearest the coast line, in 28 and 29 deg. Extensive downs, affording the finest
pasturage for sheep, with the soil formed by the decomposition of whinstone,
is the general character of the country, while numerous rivulets, all running to
the northward and westward, and rich flats for cultivation, offer every induce-
ment for a speedy settlement of this beautiful country. The elevation of these
downs is considerable; Mr. Cunningham having ascertained, by barometrical
observation, that although not so lofty as the village of Bathurst, they are as.
much as 1,500 and 1,800 feet above the level of the sea, while Liverpool plains,
so much further inland, averages only 900 feet. Mr. Cunningham, of course
kept too far inland to see any thing of the rivers Hastings, Logan, or Brisbane:
28. 6. S. was the farthest point he penetrated to, and the meridian of 150. E.,
about seventy miles from one settlement on the Brisbane.”
All the waters crossed by Mr. C. were running to the
north and westward; i. e. toward the great interior swamps,
and he appears not to have thrown any additional light upon


the mysterious long-pending question of what becomes of our
internal waters ? The colonists and emigrants however need
not be apprehensive that the swamp barrier will check the
enterprise of the present day, since between that and the
mountainous country dividing the eastern and western waters,
is an immense tract of unoccupied country, superior in quality
to those parts already settled upon.
This is the extent of my information, whether derived from
personal inspection, or from the accounts of others, upon this
part of the colony. I can confidently recommend it to the
capitalist; for a more congenial country for the growth of
fine wool—rearing every description of cattle—as well as
raising various kinds of agricultural produce, cannot, in my
opinion, exist.
The next division of country I feel necessary to describe,
is that bordering on the lake Macquarie, on the hanks of
which, besides the station of the London Missionary Estab-
lishment for the instruction of the aboriginal natives, are only
one or two settlers. The lands in the vicinity of this lake
partake of the characteristic quality of the country along the
sea coast; viz. thin strata of light sandy soil, tracts with sand
and gravelly surface; hut on the margin of the lake, together
with the vallies surrounding it, are occasional tracts of pro-
ductive land. For this reason, the district of lake Mac-
quarie is not adapted to the settler who contemplates be-
coming the proprietor of large flocks and herds, or a busied
agriculture,—but is well suited to the retired naval, military,
and civil officer, or merchant, inclined to “ quit the busy
scene”— one who is fond of shooting, hunting, fishing, or
boat sailing; where he can enjoy cheap living, with a most
salubrious air, and amply gratify all his wishes. Here are
kangaroos, ducks, swans, pidgeons, quails, as well as fish,
particularly oysters, which are of a very superior quality, and


caught in great abundance. The sail in a boat sufficiently
large is exceedingly pleasant to Sydney or to King’s Town,
being from the entrance of the lake fifteen miles to the former,
and about fifty to the latter place.
Proceeding northward, I must drop a few remarks on the
lands bordering on the grant of the Australian Agricultural
Company. I shall begin with those on the south side, in-
cluding the south banks of the harbour of Port Stephens,
noticing also the lands on the Carrington river, both of which
resemble in quality that which I lastly described on the
banks of the lake Macquarie, and are adapted to the same
purposes.
On the west of William river (which is the western boundary
of the Company’s grant) is an extensive tract of profitable
grazing country, and being within a few miles of the naviga
tion of that river, will admit of bulky agricultural products
being raised for the Sydney markets.
On the north bank of the Manning river (this river being
the northern boundary of the Company’s grant) is much rich
alluvial and good upland country, being also close to its
navigable waters. Upon the hanks of this river, large quan-
tities of magnificent cedar trees grow, whose dimensions are
from thirty to sixty feet, with a diameter of from four to six
feet. But the great drawback to the prosperity of this place
when it becomes open to settlers, (it being to the north of
Cape Hawke, and consequently without the present limits of
settlement,) is a bar with shoal water over it, at the entrance
of the river, which has not yet however been properly sounded;
but still I fear it will not admit vessels of more than thirty
or forty tons burthen.
Farquahar’s inlet (in which is the mouth of the Manning
river) is situated in lat. 32° S., long. 152 3 31" E., being 150
miles coastwise from Sydney, and 45 to the southward of
Port Macquarie.
Having, in the course of my official duties, visited Port


Macquarie and the Hastings river, I shall not he out of place
in noticing those parts.
This is the place I have before spoken of as being that to
which the convicts under colonial sentences were removed,
when the river Hunter was opened to settlers, in 1822; and
which has continued its penal character ever since. It was
anticipated by Wentworth, in his last addition of 1824, that
this place would be speedily open to emigrants. The Govern-
ment have, for a considerable time, been effecting a gradual
reduction of their establishment here. No additional pri-
soners have been sent thither for some time, doubtless with
a view to its speedy abandonment as a penal settlement. It
may therefore be expected that, at no very distant period,
settlers will be allowed to proceed to this place.
I am much less sanguine in my opinion of the good quali-
ties of the land on this river, than Mr. Wentworth and Mr.
Oxley; the latter gentleman having, in his journal of 1818,
expatiated largely on it. The general character of the country
in this neighbourhood is a large proportion of rich alluvial
land upon the banks of streams, but inferior to that on the
Hawksbury and Hunter’s rivers.
This description of country is heavily timbered; its great
richness producing, independent of forest trees, a burthen-
some jungle, causing an expense to clear it of from four to
five pounds an acre.
Where this part of the colony fails to be as desirable as
most other parts, is in the character of the upland
which is almost wholly of an inferior second class nature.
The hills rise abruptly, and become elyated at a short distance
from the streams, being in some places rocky, and generally
wanting in a proper depth of soil to be productive in herbage.
There appears also to be a continued succession (for a con-
siderable distance) of this elevated inferior country; and
there is no prospect of an outlet to Liverpool plains, as from
Hunter’s river.


The lands upon the Hastings are therefore adapted to the
agriculturist, and not for the extensive grazier. The settle-
ment of the country is not likely to extend far beyond the
navigable parts of the river.
The port here is very dangerous for vessels to enter, ad-
mitting none but small coasting craft; these however will be
fully competent to convey away all the produce of the adja-
cent country.
The Government have at this place employed the whole of
the convicts sent thither (at one time amounting to upwards
of 1500 men) in building and beautifying the town, and in
preparing land, and pursuing agriculture on a large scale;
the intention being, the profitable employ of the convicts in
raising grain for the consumption of the settlement. They
have also formed large experimental farms for the growth
of sugar cane, cotton, tobacco, and flax; of the success
of which at this place (provided labor can be commanded)
there is said to be no doubt. The experiments I here
allude to are very laudable, if such were put into practice
on the scale that experiments should be, and agreeably
to the original intention. The contrary has however been
the case, and a profligate waste of labor gone into. There
were for years from two to three hundred men employed
on this work, erecting buildings, preparing land, planting,
hilling, cleaning, &c. sugar cane and cotton plants; pre-
senting all the bustle of a West India plantation, but without
possessing competent directors, or necessary apparatus for
•bringing their crops into the usefulness of which they were
capable: and thus large quantities of fine cane have been grown
with little other prospect than that of allowing them to rot. I
understood on leaving the colony, that a gentleman from the
West Indies was about to rent, or receive on some terms,
these experimental estates.
The labor employed in the growth of grain at port Mac


quarie hag been equally injudicious; and lamin no danger
of incurring honest contradiction in stating, that every bushel
raised there by the Government has cost them three times as
much as it could be purchased for from the settlers. Exten-
sive grain establishments, conducted by Government, when
the convicts could have been more profitably employed, is
not consistent with the character and general policy of the
British nation. Their becoming competitors with the agri-
cultural interest of the colony, has very justly occasioned
much unpleasant feeling amongst that body.
To shew that the convicts could have been much better
employed at port Macquarie than in growing grain, cultivating
large experimental sugar estates, or in building useless
houses, I shall devote a short space here.
They would have been more profitably employed in clearing
land, (and which will apply to all other penal settlements in
the colony that are intended for future occupation,) prepara-
tory to its ceasing to be a penal settlement. For clearing
land thus performed the emigrant would gladly pay to the
Government a proper price by instalments, but charging
interest from the time possession is first given. For example,
suppose from the end of the year 1822 to the end of 1827,
the Government had employed on the lands of the Hastings
river the average number of 1000 men every year; thus, after
allowing upwards of thirty per cent for men who from youth
or infirmity might not be able bodied, and for the natural indo-
lence of men under coersive labor, my estimate is, that ten
men will cut down and burn off the timber, and stump one
acre of brush* land per week; and consequently 1,000 men
would perform in one week 100 acres; in one year 6,200
acres; and in five years 26,000 acres; which at £4 per
* It is necessary to explain the colonial term of “ brush land,*’ being that
which is situated on the banks of, and running parallel to the rivers. This land
is alluvial, and from its excessive richness, produces larger and heavier timber
than other lands, and also a thick jungle, or underwood: hence the term u brush
land” is used.


acre,* being a low average price for clearing brush land, will
give £104,000; a sum I can scarcely venture to judge how
many fold greater than the value of grain grown and houses
built at this place in the period alluded to. And thus a large
extent of land would be now in a state to afford immediate
produce; solid improvement in that part of the colony would
be twenty years more forward than it now is; and the nation
would be amply reimbursed for the expences of that establish-
ment.
In concluding these remarks on unappropriated country—
the importance of which, in directing the settler’s choice, he
cannot but feel—l would further add, that in the selection of
his position he must be guided more by the extent of capital
he can command than by the local advantages of any given
place. Thus, to a settler having but limited means, it would
be great folly to proceed to the distant parts of Argyle,
Bathurst, the upper part of Hunter’s river, or Liverpool
plains, to reach either of which places he must have teams,
carriages, and strength of party, which only those who are
possessed of a respectable capital can command. A person
therefore situated as the former, should if possible settle upon
the banks of some navigable waters, or some place within
the present settled districts; whereas the latter, being pos-
sessed of a competent capital, and inclined to become the
proprietor of flocks and herds (which is certainly the better
investment now) should proceed to the interior, where the
superior grass lands will amply repay him for his settling at
a distant position, and from which many agricultural pro-
ducts can also be raised and conveyed to market.
It must too be borne in mind, that the lands on the banks
of navigable waters are but in few places congenial to the
carrying on both of extensive stock and agricultural establish-
ments, but adapted more particularly to the latter.
* £4 per acre, under proper management, would be nearly reimbursed by the
profits arising from the crops of the first year.


PRESENT STATE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE
COLONY.
In my brief account of the present agricultural state of the
colony, I shall bring to view its several present products, and
the relative advantages attending the culture of each respec-
tively ; viz. wheat, maize, barley, rye, oats, peas, turnips,
rape, and English grasses.
Wheat and maize have been cultivated with considerable
advantage to the growers, up'to the years 1822 and 1823,
when the Government first became extensive cultivators, and
first adopted the system of purchasing grain by tender,
instead of receiving it into the granaries at a fixed remu-
nerating price, thereby affecting the cultivators in a threefold
manner.
First —By their keeping a greater number of men than
hitherto in their immediate employ, the wants of the settlers
were not adequately supplied.
Secondly —The demand of the Government for grain was
considerably lessened, in consequence of their becoming
growers.
Thirdly —The system of buying by tender, when shop-
keepers, innkeepers, and others, were enabled to exchange
their commodities with the needy settler for grain, and thus
they became, with few exceptions, the contractors with
Government; consequently the price of wheat fell to 3s. 6d.
and maize to 2s. per bushel, being about 100 per cent, less
than is allowed to be a remunerating price.
I do not mean to censure Government for using the
economy they did in purchasing the grain required by them
by private tender, instead of a fixed price, which had
prevailed up to this period; but I would ask, since the
Government had very liberally encouraged speculation in
colonial agriculture, whether some notice should not have
been given previous to causing such a material change in


the method of purchase ? and also, since the Government
purchases guided the price in the colony, like the Mark-
lane of London that of England, whether it would not have
been politic in them to have purchased at a fixed remune-
rating price?* This would have afforded a proper protec-
tion to the agricultural interest, and have only sacrificed a
small momentary advantage for a great public good.
I have gone into this length to show the cause and period
of the first decline of agriculture in New South Wales.
Since the year 1823, from the great introduction of emi-
grant settlers, agriculture would have assumed a different
appearance but for the continued total indifference of the
Government to that interest; a want of proper emulation
and spirit amongst the farmers is therefore very manifest.
The want of some legislative enactments to encourage
colonial distillation, as well as to restrict the importation of
foreign grain and flour,f is now obviously necessary.
The fluctuations in the price of grain of late years, and up
to this period, independent of any casualty of crop, have
been very excessive, occasioned altogether by the large and
unnecessary importations I have just alluded to, making the
avocation of an agriculturist too speculative for the straight
forward English farmer to enter into.
The average price for the last year has been under ss.
per bushel for wheat, and 4s. for maize. The great price of
the latter, however, was occasioned by a less than average
crop prevailing.
From the inadequate price of grain of late, arising from the
circumstances I have briefly mentioned, it maybe apprehended
that a great portion of wheat land will remain untilled, and
* Seven shillings per bushel, at the period alluded to, would be a fair price to
the grower.
■f- Importations of grain and flour, during the last two years, have been allow-
ed from Valparaiso ; American flour, via Batavia, and other places, together
with a constant enormous supply from theJßritish colony of Van Diemen’s
Land,


that on any casualty happening to the crop, the produce of the
year will in that case be found insufficient for the demands of
the colony. The colonists do not store wheat when it is low,
but give it to their stock, the average of years proving that
it cannot be done to advantage.
The agriculturists have also suffered serious disappoint-
ment in not receiving the advantages expected to result to
them through distillation. Two colonial capitalists have
erected very expensive buildings for the purpose of distil-
ling, which have been put to work. Those establishments
were upon a scale which every one hoped would have en-
sured a great consumption of the superabundant grain of
the colony. These houses, at the time of my departure,
although wheat was but 4s. 6d. per bushel, were all but idle
—it having been found, after well tried experiments, that
they could not compete with the West India and other
foreign spirits which were allowed to be imported;—the
former paying a duty of 6s. and the latter Js. Gd. per gallon,
while the colonial distilled spirits pay 2s. Gd. per gallon.
The prejudice and disposition of the spirit-drinkers is so
strong in favour of old West India rum, that the difference
in price of 3s. Gd. per gallon is not a sufficient protection to
the agriculturist and distiller.
It would therefore be wise in the existing authorities to
attach to West India rum the same duty as formerly paid,
being 10s. per gallon, or remit the duty on colonial distilla-
tion, when, in all probability, there would be a greater con-
sumption of colonial distilled spirits.
The colony is suited to the growth of wheat and maize;
the former averaging about twenty-two, and the latter forty-
five bushels to the acre. Wheat is subject to the same
disease and failure as in England, but its effects are less de-
structive. Maize is subject to no casuality, if showers pre-
vail at the time of planting; a good soil and proper cleaning
will then insure a productive crop.


Corn-merchants, mills, and flour exporters, are much wanted
in New South Wales. It would be worth the attention
of any capitalist, who should deal in grain and flour, to pre-
pare flour for exportaion on the same principle as the Ame-
ricans do.
The eastern ports of South America, Mauritius, Batavia,
and the Cape of Good Hope, will afford ample markets.
English barley is a saving crop, averaging thirty bushels
per acre; but owing to the colonial breweries being yet in
their infancy, a small quantity only is required for malting,
and otherwise the sale is very limited ; farmers, however,
grow this grain for domestic purposes.
A grain, called with us “ Cape barley,” which is, I be-
lieve, really “ Siberian wheat,” is grown to advantage.
Rye is a productive crop in the deep rich lands ; but as it
is only needed for malting purposes, and the demand for
that being small, it is but little cultivated.
Oats are not found to answer; the crop maintains an
appearance of great productiveness until within ten or twelve
days of its mature state, when from the too great heat for the
exposed situation of the grain, premature ripeness is occa-
sioned, and hence a lank light grain is produced.
Barley, rye, and oats are sown in June and July (the De-
cember and January of England); if sown in the spring,
through the powerful vegetation, their progress is too rapid
to allow of a profitable crop.
Peas are a sure and productive crop, but only grown for
domestic purposes.
Turnips are not extensively cultivated, notwithstanding
there is much less failure than in England from the fly. They
are not equal in weight to the crops raised there, in conse-
quence of the early winter frosts not being sufficient to cause
the necessary check to the exuberant growth of the plant, s'o
as to produce a sufficient weight of root. There is not, how-
ever, the same necessity for turnips as in England,—the


fattening of homed cattle or sheep with them being unneces-
sary, and young cattle do not require any artificial food
during the winter months.
Rape is exceedingly productive, and a useful crop for
sheep during the lambing season and cold weather; but it is
not so extensively grown as the interests of the colony appear
to demand.
The culture of grasses is also attended to; though but few
of them will resist the drought of a New South Wales, sum-
mer. Those most adapted to the climate are Dutch clover,
lucern, meadow-fescue, rib grass, and burnet.
The curing of hay is exceedingly profitable within a reason-
able distance for carriage to Sydney, where good hay is
never sold at less than £B, and sometimes as high as £l2
per ton: two tons to the acre is the average produce of rich
meadow land, from English grasses. Grass seeds as named
above should be taken out by emigrants, properly packed in
tin cases.
Experiments have been made by various settlers, as well
as by Government, on the growth of the sugar cane, cotton,
and tobacco j the two former it is thought will not produce
well to the southward of Port Macquarie, hut the latter is
grown by settlers in all parts of the colony, for their home
consumption. It has been hitherto imported from the Bra-
zils ; but it is hoped that this will not be much longer allowed,
since the colony is so capable of producing the plant.
From what I have briefly stated, the present agricultural
state of the colony may be gathered, which at this time
cannot be said to be prosperous, and which may be attri-
buted to the want of a protecting influence of the legisla-
tive Government. An active agriculture is to all countries
richer than mines of gold: the inertness of the colonial
Government, therefore, in not fostering it, is highly cen-
surable.
It should also be observed, that the wealthy colonists are
K


graziers and not agriculturists; being too independent to
enter upon the more laborious but not less honorable avoca-
tion. Thus the agricultural interest is not represented in the
Colonial Council; —the voice of that body is never likely
to reach the gracious ear. The legislative Government of the
colony is composed of five members, two of whom are the
greatest stock proprietors there, and one is a merchant;
hence those interests are represented, while the agricultural
is not.
The colony however is not without an Agricultural Society,
which, from the number and respectability of its members,
would induce the belief that some real interest was felt for
that from which it takes its designation: but they are almost
entirely devoted to the improvement of fine wool, the symme-
try and size of stock of every description, and the production
of exportable commodities : objects all very laudable.
Although this society has existed some years, it is but
lately that a premium was recommended for the best plough-
man, or for improved implements of husbandry. There is no
premium or medal offered to him who exports the greatest
quantity of grain or flour; nor to the distiller or brewer who
consumes the greatest quantity of grain; or any other point
encouraging agriculture.
■ It will be sufficient for me to add, that New South Wales
cannot yet boast of a Coke, a Sinclair, or a Somerville, to take
the helm of colonial agricultural affairs, and to give wealth
to the colony through their great knowledge and noble
actions.
It is truly unaccountable, that a young colony of only
about thirty thousand free inhabitants should be paying
foreign nations and colonies (including freight and merchants’
profits) a sum upwards of two hundred thousand pounds per
year for spirits, and from eight to ten thousand per year for
tobacco, without any interchange of trade whatever; and yet
grain is of so little value as to be worth scarcely more than


the expence of cleaning and carrying to market. Tobacco
might also be grown in undoubted abundance for the con-
sumption of the colony. Thus, through the want of pro-
tecting duties, agriculture is allowed to sink into ruin.
Second in rank to the Australian Agricultural Society, but
no less important, are the services likely to result to the
country from the “ Farmers’ Club,” lately instituted by the
proprietors of the infant settlements on the Hunter. Here is
another instance of the rapid strides colonization has made
in this division of New South Wales—where, in 1822, not a
respectable emigrant was settled—in 1827, a country upwards
of one hundred miles in one direction is well occupied; and
amongst the landholders unanimity and respectability suf-
ficient, from a desire to promote the public weal, to insti-
tute at this early period a society (under the unassuming title
of the Farmers’ Club) for the laudable purpose of encouraging
agriculture.
The president’s address to his coadjutors at one of the
meetings regarding this undertaking is so highly patriotic,
interesting, and important, that I am induced to give place to
it, together with the premiums determined to be awarded.
FARMERS’ CLUB.
(SECOND MEETING)
A numerous meeting of landed proprietors took place at Hallier’s Hotel,
Patterson’s Plains, on Monday, the 3d. Sept. 1827, James P. Webber, Esq. in
the chair, Alexander Warren, Esq. Deputy Chairman; —when an address was
delivered by the Chairman to the following effect:—
“ Gentlemen, —I congratulate you on the complete establishment of our
Society, under circumstances so favourable as to include within its circle almost
every individual by whose intelligence and activity it can be benefitted.
“ Doubts have been entertained if we should be able to constitute a club
from the resident proprietors alone. Our success in this point I anticipate as a
prelude to a long course of practical benefit to the neighbourhood and to the
k 2


colony at large; for by excluding absentees, we divest ourselves of that feeble-
ness which attends the efforts of theorists on agricultural topics, and of which
the Sydney Agricultural Society forms so prominent an instance. Let us hope
that our humble efforts may have the effect of rousing this giant from his
slumbers, and that the Sydney Society may at length realize the expectations of
the colony.
“ In stating my ideas as to our course of proceeding, I beg you will receive
them as hints, which may perhaps be thought useful rather in directing our atten-
tion to a few leading objects which deeply involve the property of the Hunter’s
river settler, than by embracing too wide a field, to which our infantile efforts
may eventually be found inadequate.
“ The first subject to which I shall allude, is the condition of our colonial
com trade, which is now so deeply depressed as to excite wonder that the
colonists have not been roused from their habitual apathy to turn the state of
the distillery laws on the attention of government, with a view to their altera-
tion and improvement. It was never intended by the British Government that
any other than a com distillation should be worked in this colony. But I
believe that no spirit has hitherto been extracted from that or any other colonial
produce;—on the contrary, a deleterious compound is made from sugar, with
which imported spirits are extensively adulterated, and this too at a period
when a scarcity of this important article of consumption is co-existent with a
redundant supply of wheat.
“ I have next to notice the bad state of the road between Sydney and Hunter’s
river, on which we are dependent for the transport of our fat cattle to mar-
ket. This object has not escaped the vigilance of the Colonial Government,
and already thirty miles of excellent road are completed; but I beg to suggest
for your consideration whether a marked bridle road, passable for cattle and
sheep, would not in the first instance be preferable, as being almost immedi-
ately attainable, and capable of being used until a perfect road can be completed.
I am credibly informed, that in a few places the bush road is at present almost
impassable from steep rocks, which a few weeks’ labour would entirely remove.
I am convinced that a suggestion of this nature from the Society will meet
with attention from Government
“ The reputatation which the district of Hunter’s river has already obtained
for its dairy produce reflects the highest credit upon the settlers. With a view
to the improvement of our cheese, 1 recommend a sum to be appropriated from
our funds, as a reward for the best cheese to be produced at the next annual
meeting.
“ The cultivation of tobacco is in its infancy. I trust that we shall shortly
receive some papers upon the preparation of this important staple.
“ A premium should be offered for the greatest quantity of cotton produced.
lam of opinion that our climate is suitable. Some small parcels have been
grown, which in one or two instances were manufactured into candle-wick,
during the recent scarcity of that article
“ The cultivation of the vine does not appear to have succeeded in the
colony. I think its want of success may in a great measure be attributed to
indolence. I trust that the energy of the Hunter’s river settlers will be directed
to this branch of rural economy.
“ I am desirous to press upon your notice the necessity of paying minute
attention to the making of beer and cider. No doubt difficulties are interposed
by the climate; but I have observed when many individuals of my acquaint-
ance made their first settlement, a great degree of attention was paid this
object, when, with bad materials and imperfect apparatus, a quality was pro-
duced calculated to excite the most gratifying anticipations; but the progress
of indolence unfortunately keeps pace with the progress of settlement, and


years pass on ■without attempting to perfect what had commenced so well; the
settlers (and with shame I say it) preferring the high priced and unwholesome
compounds vended in Sydney under the names of wine and spirits, to the
products of their own land. I trust that the offer of a considerable pre-
mium will rouse our neighbours from their inactivity. Well assured 1 am that
success will attend their efforts during the winter months. The manufacture
of cider from peaches I have no doubt may be so far improved as to supply
a wholesome and grateful beverage for the working classes during the heat of
summer.
“ I cannot conclude, without noticing the high price of all imported
goods in this colony, upon the causes of which I shall not now touch; but
the consequences are most pernicious to the agricultural interest. Measuring
the price of goods by a wheat standard, the result is most alarming; and, as
this unnatural state seems likely to continue, I wish to impress on the minds of
the gentlemen now present, the propriety of paying the utmost degree of
attention to the removal of an pvil which menaces not only our independence
but our existence.
“ It is well known to you, that unless a severe and rigid system of economy
is practised by the settler, ruin inevitably follows; which arises from the high
price of his purchased necessaries, combined with a fluctuating and too gene-
rally low price of produce; and the wealth which under a wholesome system
would circulate through, and vivify every branch of the community, is con-
centrated amongst the monopolizers of Sydney—raising a few, and, generally
speaking, an unworthy few, into affluence, at the expense of the cultivators of
the land. So long as the present banking system is continued, I own 1 can-
not see any effectual remedy; but I trust that at no very distant period we
shall be able to form a local society for the importation of a few leading and
indispensable articles of consumption, which, joined to an active and vigilant
attention to the raising on our own land as many supplies as possible, will re-
lieve ourselves, and so far mitigate the evil, and probably influence other
parts of the community by our example; at all events, I hope we shall hear
no more of sending to England for hams, cheese, soap, candles, or beer; but
by devoting that energy which is inherent in our counytrmen, to the full
developement of the valuable qualities of soil and climate which this colony
possesses, we may become entitled to the appellation of a happy, contented,
and prosperous community.”
The members were so much gratified with it, that they requested Mr. Web-
ber would allow the subjects to be entered amongst the papers of the Club.
The motion was made by Mr. Warren, seconded by Mr. Thurlow, and car-
ried unanimously.
A number of premiums was then proposed to be offered by the Club, to
successful competitors, in various branches of farming, &c.
The Resolutions, which were carried, will be found in the next page.
After the business of the day was gone through, Mr. Webber hiving left
the chair, it was proposed and carried unanimously—
That the thanks of the meeting he voted that gentleman for his able con-
duct in the chair. After which, the company sat down to an excellent din-
der, provided for the occasion, when a number of loyal and patriotic toasts
were given, and the evening was spent with great conviviality.


FARMERS’ CLUB, HUNTER’S RIVER.
Resolutions adopted at a Meeting of the Farmers’ Club, on the sth of Sep-
tember, relative to Premiums offered by the Club:—
FIRST PREMIUM.
For the person who, at the next annual meeting in July next, shall produce
the best tobacco, of his own growth and manufacture, the specimen not to be
less than ten pounds weight, to be grown from the date hereof, a piece of
plate, value £5.
SECOND.

piece of plate, value £s.—Should the same be made under the superintendence
of a lady, her wishes shall be consulted in the appropriation of the sum.
THIRD.
For the person who shall produce the best beer, the quantity to be not less
than five gallons, and not to be in bottle, a piece of plate, value £5. The
successful candidate to produce a sample of the malt, the same being grown
upon his farm.
FOURTH.
For the person who shall grow the greatest quantity of cotton, sample to be
produced, of not less than twenty pounds weight, a piece of plate, value £5.
FIFTH.
For the individual who shall plant the greatest quantity of vines, not less
than five hundred within the present year, a piece of plate, value £5.
SIXTH.
That a silver medal be given to the individual who shall produce the best
sample of hops, quantity not to be less than fourteen pounds weight.
SEVENTH.
That a premium of half a dollar be given to such person as shall bring to
the Society a native dog’s skin, the same to be certified by one of the mem-
bers of the Club as having been killed within his neighbourhood.
The Society reserve to themselves the prerogative of withholding premiums
when there is a deficiency of quality, or absence of competition.
JOHN BROWN, Secretary.
For a more particular description of the agriculture and
grazing of New South Wales, I refer the emigrant to Mr.
Atkinson’s publication upon these subjects, by which he
may he safely guided as it regards the seasons, and his first
operations on his arrival.


THE AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY.
Connected also with the future progress and prosperity of
agriculture in New South Wales, is the degree of activity and
zeal pursued in the management of the affairs of this Com-
pany.
The intention is, to cultivate every agricultural produc-
tion which the climate and soil are capable of producing;
and thus in a short time there is every ground to hope, that
the colonist will receive the benefit of the best possible
practical experiments, both in new products, suited to the
domestic purposes of the colony, as well as those for expor-
tation ; and that the particular expence, with profit or loss,
on the culture of tobacco, cotton, flax, vine, and other arti-
cles, will soon appear.
Another object of the Company—which, when carried into
effect, will render a very material service to the country —is
to clear a great quantity of their best lands, for the purpose
of establishing thereon a body of tenantry on a liberal
lease. This would be suited to emigrants who possessed
only limited means, who had much better become tenants
here, than, calculating on their own resources, fail in the at-
tempt of first entering upon lands which they might obtain
by grant. Within the Company’s grant, between the lati-
tudes of 32° and 33° S. are several small rivers connected
with the sea, and navigable through extensive tracts of rich
land, the banks of which are well adapted for this purpose.
The Company have also vested considerable sums in the
introduction of superior stock from Europe; and since the
colonist will be soon enabled to purchase from them ani-
mals of the most approved breeds, at a reasonable rate, he
will be benefitted to a considerable extent.
Being officially present in January, 1826, when the Com-
pany’s agent, Mr. Dawson, first selected and took posses


sion of the lands on the north of the harbour of Port Ste-
phens, I felt a desire, previous to leaving the colony, to wit-
ness the progress he had made.
With this view I visited the settlement in June, 1827, and
was surprised to observe with what amazing rapidity im-
provements had gone forward. Here, in the short space of
seventeen months, spacious stores and workshops were
built; Mr. Dawson himself, and the whole of his officers,
were comfortably housed; extensive brick-making was in
activity for various projected buildings; large tracts had
been cleared and fenced, and ploughs were already diligently
at work; large kitchen and experimental gardens were
also in a high state of culture. The Company’s - flocks and
herds then grazed over upwards of three hundred square
miles of country. In fact, nothing could exceed the regu-
larity and zeal which every department bore under Mr. Daw-
son’s management; and although from three to four hundred
men were already in the Company’s employ, I am confident,
under any other management, the work performed would
have fallen far short of the forward state it at that period
presented.
Great hopes are entertained by Mr. Dawson of his suc-
ceeding in bringing the free labour of the aboriginal natives
to valuable account to the Company and colonists generally.
Mr. Dawson’s plan for the attainment of this object is, to
select such light labour as is most congenial to their inclina-
tions, and undeviatingly at the close of each day to pay
each man the reward of his hire—this payment being always
made in the articles most necessary to their comfort,
namely, clothing and food, with, on particular occasions,
the addition of tea, sugar, and tobacco. Thus, by a perse-
verance in the principle of giving an equivalent reward for
their labour; by protecting them from the insults and oppres-
sion they are subject to through the half-civilized Euro-
peans with whom they mix; by raising in them a desire.


through a continued habit, for the same comforts and luxu-
ries as we enjoy (and thereby creating a stimulus to their
exertions, and an excitement to weaning themselves from
their native wandering habits); I have strong hopes of Mr.
Dawson’s succeeding in this very important object:, then
would be produced an able race of field and other labourers,
void of every compulsory feeling, making them, in fact,
members of the British family, possessing the same privi-
leges and freedom as any Briton born.
When at Port Stephens, I saw about forty women well
employed, and whose daily attendance, I was informed, had
for some time been very regular; no doubt from their having
been rewarded at the close of each day, as I have before
observed.
There is a much greater difficulty in bringing the men to
industrious habits than the women; it is a custom amongst
these aboriginals, as among most other uncivilized people,
to make the women perform every drudgery in their domes-
tic labours; and this custom is likely to follow them in any
other occupation which their inclination may induce them
to enter upon. - The men seldom do more than hunt and
build their wigwams, while the women have numberless of-
fices to perform, which are enforced with the same rigour,
and through the same method of summary punishment, that
the slave-master adopts towards his slave. Thus, in endea-
vouring to make these people feel the advantages of indus-
try, this hereditary habit of obliging the women to perform
every description of work, is a great bar to its accomplish-
ment.
PRICE OF LAND.
The price of land in New South Wales must be determined
by the same causes which exist in other countries, viz. by
its distance from a port of shipment, and the larger towns;
its access to such by roads or navigable waters; its quality


and state of improvement; and the value of capital in its
neighbourhood. Such are the advantages presented to the
capitalist for investment in this colony, in concerns making
a superior return than if vested in land, that it is but seldom
bought, as in England, with a view to the secure lodgment
of cash only; but by men of large estate in the colony, who
embrace every opportunity of adding to their already con-
siderable domains.
The number, however, of this description of purchasers
being yet limited, lands are generally sold at a low price,
and computing the interest which money now invested in
land will produce, with the great progressive increase in the
value thereof, which must be in a ratio with the known
growing prosperity of the colony, it is my opinion that a
better investment of capital than in land need not be enquired
after.
Inferior farms (which most are) within twenty-five miles
of Sydney, with from 50 to 100 acres cleared, in a bad state
of cultivation, and inferior buildings, can be purchased at
from £l. to £l. ss. per acre, being from eight to ten years’
purchase. Those farms possessing buildings and improve-
ments of a better description, will of course sell for more per
acre.
Cleared farms, from 50 to 200 acres in extent, in a toler-
able state of cultivation, and bad buildings, on the Hawkes-
bury or Nepean rivers, will sell from £8 to £lO per acre,
being from ten to twelve years’ purchase.
Unimproved lands, or those possessing but little improve-
ment on the navigable waters of Hunter’s river, are worth
from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per acre. Improved and good estates
in the same district, if under 1000 acres, having a substan-
tial cottage, barn, and other buildings, will not sell for more
than 15s. per acre, being equal to about ten years’ pur-
chase.
•Unimproved land situated in the upper district of Hun


ter’s river, well watered, is worth from 7 s - 6 d. to 10s. per
acre.
From the present state of capital in New South Wales, I
consider that improved lands can always be purchased, if
prudently done, at about ten years’ purchase on the net
rental, affording a return of 10 per cent, per annum; to
which may be added, during the next ten years at least,
through the progressive increase in the value of land, about
2 per cent, per annum.
HINTS UPON THE MOST JUDICIOUS METHOD OF
INVESTING CAPITAL.
However great or small the settler’s amount of capital is
on his arrival, it must he of importance to him to decide
with judgment to what particular channel he had better
direct it. To enable him, therefore, to arrive at this object,
I shall offer my opinion, gathered from an experience of up-
wards of seven years’ residence in the colony.
I will suppose all emigrants to be married, having the
comforts of a wife and family to attend to.
From the existing conditions for the granting of land,- it
is declared that settlers are not entitled to receive any, ex-
cept they possess a capital of £250 and upwards—this sum
entitling the settler to the smallest grant of 320 acres.
To the settler possessed of £250 only, I advise his pro-
curing from the Government the grant which he is entitled
to, but not to settle on the same immediately. He will find
it more to his advantage to rent a farm from three to five
years, with buildings erected, land cleared, and in a state of
cultivation, which he will find but little difficulty in procur-
ing, of from 50 to 250 acres, varying from £4O to £7O per
annum, according to the quality and state of improvement.
In the event of his so doing, he had better vest about £lOO,
or thereabout, in young cows, £5O in a team of four oxen.

£5O in pigs, carts, plough, &c. appropriating the remaining
£5O to the maintenance of his family and establishment, be-
fore returns can take place.
At the end of about three years, he, in all probability, will
find himself sufficiently master of cash and stock to enter
upon his own land, having in the mean time effected some
improvement in clearing it, and building a cottage for the
reception of his family. If he is possessed of any sum be-
tween that last spoken of, and £5OO, or thereabout, I re-
commend nearly the same method; he must be guided by
his own suggestion, whether he will immediately enter upon
his own land or not, and be influenced by his contiguity to
markets, in devoting a larger or smaller sum to agricultural
purposes; though, however great the advantages from agri-
culture may appear, he should not fail to vest full one-half of
his capital in breeding stock.
If possessed of a sum of £5OO to £750,1 advise him to
make choice of a district suitable both to agricultural and
grazing purposes, and situated either on navigable waters,
or at no greater distance from such than ten to fifteen miles.
On his affecting this preliminary, I advise him to vest his
£750 capital in the following manner: —


200 improved ewes, in lamb, at £2 each
. £400
20 young cows, in calf, at £8
. 160
1 improved bred bull

[• 50

In hand for sundry expences of establish--]
[ 85
ment before returns are made* J
£1,000
Should he, however, be obliged to proceed to a greater
distance than I have above alluded to, to get suitable land,
for his location, so as to preclude him from the advantage
of conveying (at an expence not too hurthensome) grain to
market, he, in that case, should vest a larger sum in breed-
ing cattle, and less in agriculture and its attendant expences.
To one possessed of £l,OOO or thereabouts I advise (in
regard to his choice of land) his settling in a district affording
the best pasturage, without making particular reference to its
locality as regards markets for agricultural produce.
It behoves him to use caution that he does not sacrifice too
much to the desire of settling within reach of markets for
grain; and thus, in obtaining locality of position, he would
lose being in a district most suitable to sheep and cattle
grazing. To him therefore thus situated, who would cul-
tivate hut little more than his own consumption would re-
quire, I advise his capital being vested nearly in the following
manner:—
* If twenty cows are judiciously purchased and well calculated for the dairy, a
return, under proper management, at the rate of £l5O per year, will almost
immediately take place.


To the capitalist possessed of £1,500,1 advise as the fore-
going to make grazing generally, and a return through the
dairy, his primary object.
He might buy nearly as follows ;
300 improved young ewes, at £2. 10s. each . £750
30 young cows, in calf, at £8 .... 240
8 oxen at £l3, —one bull £l6 .... 120
And vesting the remaining sum nearly in the manner as before
advised; making provision however for the purchase of six
thorough-bred merino or Saxon rams at £l5 each; which
he will require about the Ist of November following his
settling.
A person possessed of capital larger than that I have
spoken of, will increase proportionately to his means the
number and quality of stock of all descriptions ; he can pur-
chase the most highly improved ewes at from £3 to £4 each;
he can possess himself with a family of pure bred sheep, and
produce his own male stock. He will of course enter upon
his operations generally on a scale consistent with the amount
he is possessed of.
If asked what return I contemplate from capital so vested,
I could with confidence say, that on the sum total vested in
stock, a return of 25 per cent, per annum may be expected.
The amount appropriated to buildings, improvements in land,
&c. cannot present the like profit, but being added to the
value of every man’s estate (and on which a handsome pro-
gressive increase will arise) will he in the end equally advan-
tageous to him.
The settler, in vesting his capital, should not lose sight of
the great importance the growth of fine wool is likely to he
to the colony; he therefore, in my opinion, would be justi-
fied in making some sacrifice, with a view of purchasing his
first ewes of an improved breed. This, however, should not
be attempted by one of confined means, since, by his devot


ing the greater part of his property to that object, in the
event of accident, or particular casualty happening to his
flock, he would suffer to an irrecoverable extent. That de-
structive disease in sheep—the rot, has made its appearance
in some districts of the colony; the proprietors therefore
should, on all occasions, adopt the usual method of selecting
their pastures at particular seasons, being the best preven-
tive yet known. Mr. Towne, chemist, 9, Wellington Ter-
race, Waterloo-bridge, produces very respectable testimo-
nials of his preparing a medicine that will cure this malady.
Should it prove, by longer experience, to be the specific so
much sought after, no sheep proprietor in the colony should
be without it.
REFLECTIONS ON THE CAPABILITIES OF NEW
SOUTH WALES,
TO PRODUCE REVENUE TO THE CROWN THROUGH LAND.
In making my observations upon this head, I shall first
shew the actual quantity of land ordered to he granted in the
colony, from January 1822 to November 30th 1825, (taken
from the warrants in the office of the Surveyor General);
also the actual amount received by the Crown for land so
sold; the yearly quit rent produced upon lands granted;
and also tha capital stock created in redeemable quit rent in
that period.
And, secondly, I shall produce a recapitulation, shewing to
what extent the colony is capable of producing revenue through
land, taking as an example the ten years next following the
Ist January, 1822, and the amount of business done in
the first four years of that period, as my data, in regard to
the probable produce of revenue to the Crown in the succeed-
ing six years.

(a) As the Government will be receiving the interest of 5 per cent, per annum upon this sum, at the expiration of the term for which the quit
rent is remitted, for the payment of which the land is held responsible; it is therefore as stock to the state, on which the interest as just named is
payable, Tlie period in which the redemption of quit rent must be made, being limited to twenty years from the date of the grant, there is no doubt
out that every grantee will complete his redemption within that term, and thus the purchase of this stock is brought to a terminable period. Should
any part of this quit rent be redeemed through the scale of allowance laid down for the maintenance of convicts in the Land Regulations, No. 1,
the state, of course, will be in the same manner benefitted as if the same had been purchased with the monies of the realm.
(b) Independent of this area, granted in the period spoken of, is also that of 1,048,960 acres made by His Majesty’s Government to the Aus-
tralian Agricultural Company, as defined and agreed upon on the 9th January, 1828; —the terms being 1 j per cent, per annum upon the
fixed estimated value of Is. 6d. per acre, and also redeemable on the same principle.
SUMMARY OF LAND GRANTED IN THE GOVERNMENT OF SIR THOMAS BRISBANE, K. C. B.


It will be observed, in the four years. of the Government
of Sir Thomas Brisbane, that 753,090 acres were granted to
settlers; and also in less than five months 369,000 acres
were sold to the public at ss. per acre—the former being an
average of the whole period of 188,2725 acres a year, or for
the last two years (1824 and 1825) an average of 286,545
acres a year.
Had the sale of lands continued open to the public to
the end of one year from its commencement, I have no
doubt, from a knowledge of the disappointments felt on its
being closed, that upwards of half a million of acres would
have been disposed of. Such is now the state of capital in
the colony, and the anxiety of the capitalist to purchase un-
improved lands, with the expectation also of emigrants be-
coming purchasers, that I can venture to lay down in the
following estimate 300,000 acres a year, for the following
six years (from Nov. 1825) as being the amount which Go-
vernment will be able to make sale of.
With regard to the area which will be probably required
for grants during the succeeding six years, from 1825, I
shall place 250,000 acres a year, which is 36,545 acres less
than the average quantity granted in the years 1824 and
1825. If the local Government were acquainted with the
wants, present resources, and capital of the colony, and
governed with the characteristic liberality of the British
Government, together with the advantages of the colony
becoming every day more known to the nation, there must
appear well grounded reasons to believe, that the influx of
emigrants of capital (and the consequent demand for land
by grant and purchase) will be in a far greater ratio for the
succeeding six years, from 1825, than for the preceding two
years ; and therefore, without there be a misdirection in
the Government of the colony, a far greater extent of waste
L


country will be occupied and brought into productiveness
than I have estimated as above.
From my foregoing remarks, the amount which should
be produced to the crown from land for the ten years
from January, 1822, to December 31, 1831, will stand
thus:—

Company will have redeemed a large portion, if not the whole, of this sura, through the premium allowed them for keeping and maintaining con-
victs. Those individuals who have received lands under the same conditions as the Company have, will of course redeem their quit rent in the like
manner. 1
RECAPITULATION.


I have thus shewn to what state the colony had reached in
spreading industry over her vast plains and forests, up to the
end of 1825; and by taking the preceding four years as my
example, I have shewn to what extent the land revenue is
likely to contribute to her government and support; and
although I am anticipating the result of six years, nothing
less than wars, plagues, or a direful mis-directed policy, can
possibly prevent or curtail the realization of the foregoing
statement.
Here, then, in the period spoken of, is produced, in the
shape of monies and redeemable rents (and which become
progressively available to the purposes of Government) the
sum of £939,206 sterling; being to the nation funding at
the rate of £93,920. 12s. per year for that period, without
computing any interest on the sums actually received.
Up to the time of my leaving the colony. General Darling’s
administration had existed (commencing with the year 1826)
little more than eighteen months. To what amount lands
were actually granted and sold during that period, I could
not make myself acquainted; but judging from the various
regulations made by him, and the tardiness with which the
business on land affairs was got through, I cannot flatter
myself, nor those who may feel interested, that the Govern-
ment have availed themselves of the resources which they had
in their power, in regard to the production of revenue through
land.
That a diminution has taken place in the extent of business,
which it has been shewn might have been done, I do not
doubt. Nothing can compensate the colony for retarding
its progress and prosperity, which fact can scarcely escape
the penetration of those having the direction of colonial
affairs; and some alteration in the land regulations may there-
fore be anticipated.
Having thus far adverted to the existing regulations in
regard to the granting of land, I am further induced to offer


a few hints upon the consideration of what principle would
best conduce to the interest of the mother country and the
prosperity of the colony.
Very little room was left for amendment in the regulations
of November 1824 (No. 1); but the authorities who had
charge of their execution failed in observing their suitable-
ness to the colony; and have instead put in force their own
revised construction, pruning the original of all its liberality,
and adding thereto inapplicable clauses.
As the conditions now stand, the encouragement held out
to the emigrant (particularly to him in middling circum-
stances) to take himself and family to this colony is so incon-
siderable, and, as it regards his grant of land, differing so little
from an actual purchase, that an extensive emigration under
such a system can hardly be expected.
What occurs to me as advisable thereon is, that emigrants
from England should be charged a nominal quit rent on the
first grant for a period of not less than forty years, instead of
seven; at the expiration of which, the rent of 5 per cent,
per annum upon its original estimated value should at-
tach. In order to ensure the sale of lands to a proper
extent, all settlers, or persons of whatever description, re-
ceiving a second (or third) grant, should pay the quit rent of
five per cent, per annum upon its value, to commence from
the time of granting; and such might be made redeemable at
twenty-five years’ purchase instead of twenty. By this step,
the advantage would be given to individuals to purchase
land rather than receive it by grant; and thus, with other
good results, the local Government would be relieved from
the unpleasant task of receiving applications, and investigating
the claims of this description of colonists.
The settler arriving with his wife and family should, by
some regulation in his favor, have a superior claim to the
unmarried man, inasmuch as the expense he would have
already incurred in emigrating must have been considerably


more than that of the latter; and, also, a family once there,
is pretty good security of the settler’s intention to become a
bona fide colonist, while such would be wanting in the unmar-
ried man, who, as it too often happens, is unsettled in his
plan of proceeding.
With regard to the principle by which the local Govern-
ment should he guided in the scale of grant which they first
make to settlers, that which is now acted upon I have before
observed is objectionable. The Government have but two
points to attend to in allotting an equitable portion of land
to emigrants; first, respectability of character, through which
an honorable statement of means may be expected; and,
secondly, a knowledge of their capability to effect a specific
improvement on the land granted to them; and for which the
land itself would be held responsible. The scale of improve-
ment, as defined in the regulations No. 1, would be a very
proper one.
That the colony of New South Wales inherently presents
peculiar advantages to the English emigrant cannot be denied:
since the population of the mother country is become so over-
grown, and since the capital of the country is far more, than
can be profitably and securely vested at home, should it not
be an object with the British Government to offer such
inducements to all classes of the public, by granting land
on a liberal system, as would cause an emigration to the
colony on a large scale. To effect this object moreover is so
completely within the power of Government, without the
least expense or sacrifice to them, that no person can but
wonder at the long existence of the present injurious land
regulations. The colony is of sufficient extent to receive
and maintain a population twice the number now in Great
Britain the unoccupied parts are of no service to the
Crown in its present state; nor can it ever be till the hand
of industry reaches it: there is no one instance, within my


knowledge, of land being granted, without improvement
and capital being introduced: the arrival of emigrants to
ten times the present number, would in a very slight degree
increase the expences of the Government in the colony;
—what then can be urged against the adoption of a system
which would effeqt a great national benefit, at no other expense
than that of granting part of the immense waste lands of
New South Wales, rent-free? That this was the object of Go-
vernment at'one period is demonstrable from the regulations
No. 1 j but unfortunately for the public, the British Govern-
ment appear to have been swayed (by sanctioning the condi-
tions framed in the colony) in receiving suggestions, no doubt
offered with the best intention for the public good, but which,
if persevered in, will be next to a prohibition to future emi-
gration.
NOTES UPON THE RAPIDITY OF COLONIZATION,
ARISING FROM A LIBERAL SYSTEM
OF GRANTING LANDS.
From the early part of 1822 to the end of the year 1825, all
parts of the colony made extraordinary advances in settle-
ment, and consequently added considerably to its respecta-
bility and importance. It is difficult to determine which
division of the colony during this time made the greatest
progress. The district of Hunter’s river however (with which
I have been most connected) may be taken as an example;
here, from March 1822 to November 1826, when I left the
surveys of that district, the amazing extent of 372,141 acres
were appropriated to settlers; 132,164 acres were allotted
for church and school purposes; to which may be added
100,000 acres which were surveyed and not appropriated;
making altogether 604,305 acres. In this division of country,
occupying upwards of 150 miles along the river, which, in
1822, possessed little more than its aboriginal inhabitants, in


1826-27, more than half a million of acres were appropriated
and in a forward state of improvement. The traveller’s atten-
tion is every where arrested by a busy agriculture; houses
and yards of respectable settlers; healthy and well-fed la-
borers; and every appearance denoting rapid improvement.
Here, in 1827, were upwards of 25,000 head of horned cattle,
and 80,000 fine and improved-wool sheep; with a capital
already in possession of the settlers, and in great activity,
(independent of the original value of their land,) of from
£400,000 to £500,000. This is a scale of capital and industry
introduced in one division of a colony, in five years, to which
I doubt whether a parallel instance in the annals of coloniza-
tion can be adduced. In this period the settlements in the
counties of Camden and Argyle, with those in the Bathurst
country, also made extraordinary advances.
