FOREWORD
To celebrate over Fifty years of association with the Primary Producers of Australia, we
decided to publish this Book of Information which we hope will prove of interest to our
many friends throughout the Commonwealth.
Fifty years ago a Scotch Designing Engineer, the late W. W. Virtue, evolved what was to
be known as the Moffat-Virtue Sheep Shearing Machine, and in conjunction with his life-long
friend, the late John Moffat, one of those sterling pioneers who did so much to establish
the mining industry in the North of Queensland, a partnership was formed to introduce the
new shearing machine to the Australian Grazier.
This was the nucleus of the Company now known as Moffat-Virtue Ltd. and through the
years it has been our constant endeavour to make available to the Primary Producers an
ever-increasing range of equipment specially designed to meet our peculiar Australian
conditions.
There is a natural tendency for the Farmer and Grazier to concentrate on his immediate
interests, namely—his stock and crops, and few have been afforded an opportunity of acquiring
an intimate knowledge of things mechanical. Seeing that the selection of the right machinery
and the correct layout of the plant is of major importance, it is obvious that sound technical and
practical advice should be brought to bear on the problem.
We invite you to consult us on your mechanical problems, and in doing so we would remind
you that you are dealing with Engineers who design, manufacture and service their own
proprietary lines.
Our factory is equipped with the best Machine Tools that money can buy, and our highly
skilled Engineers and Mechanics who have "perfection” continually before them, are doing
their jobs conscientiously and well in producing those products which bear the "M-V” mark—
which in itself is a guarantee of QUALITY and SERVICE.
Our various Sales Departments are controlled by men who are not merely versed in the
art of salesmanship, but are practical men capable of analysing the most intricate problem
and setting out the most economical and satisfactory solution.
Our constant policy is one of "Keeping Ahead of the Times”, and men of outstanding
technical ability combining their expert knowledge with that of the practical Primary Producer,
are spending their time in constant research, experimenting, designing and perfecting.
It is only fitting that we should here record our sincere appreciation of the many helpful
suggestions we have received from time to time from the Man-on-the-Land. Many of these
ideas have been incorporated in our gear and have in no small degree contributed to its
general acceptance.
In conclusion, let us say that we are desirous of having our Clients look upon Moffat-Virtue
as an organisation which has something to give them rather than a mere sales force to accept
something from them.
Like all business houses we are here primarily to make a profit, but if in the process of trying
to make a profit we fail to improve matters for the man to whom we look for our profit,
then we have failed in our mission.
Remember that Moffat-Virtue governs its relations with its clients by the policy which claims
to —
Design Progressively Sell Honestly
Build Faithfully Service Sincerely
That is why it is our proud boast that—
“We made them good—Users made them famous”

timber 42 feet).
The register ton = 100 cubic feet.
A cord of wood is a pile 4 feet high, 4 feet wide and 8 feet
long.
A cord foot is 1 foot iu length of such a pile.
A cubic yard of common earth is called a load.
In board measure all boards are assued to be 1 inch thick.
A board foot is 1 foot long, 1 foot wide, and 1 inch thick ;
hence 12 board feet make 1 cubic foot.
Board feet are changed to cubic feet by dividing by 12.
Cubic feet are changed to board feet by multiplying by 12.
Masonry is estimated by the cubic foot and perch ; also
by the square foot and square yard.
Cubic feet x 4 divided by 99 equals perches.
A fathom of lathwood —6 x 6 x 6 = 216 cubic feet.
The St. Petersburg standard —5 x3x 11 = 165 cubic feet.
Cubic feet x -00606 = St. Petersburg standard.
In board and lumber measure, estimates are made on
1 inch in thickness; one-fourth the price is added
for every £ inch in thickness over one inch.

DOMESTIC MEASURES.
The following information regarding measures for
medicine, etc., may often prove useful on farms and
stations when no standard measuring appliances are at
hand :
In measuring powders and solids, the following—the
apothecaries' —is the table used for drugs :
60 grains = 1 dram
8 drams =1 ounce
12 ounces = 1 pound
It will thus be seen that 1 ounce equals 480 grains.
In troy weight the ounce also equals 480 grains, but in
avoirdupois it only equals 437 J grains.
For liquids, the measures used are as follows :
60 minims (drops) =1 dram
8 drams = 1 ounce
20 ounces 1 pint
8 pints = 1 gallon
The publican’s pint contains only 13 ounces.
In country districts it frequently occurs that no
measuring glass is available, and one is forced to use
domestic appliances for getting an approximate measure.
Roughly, the following are the equivalents for these.
They apply only to watery liquids, as, of course, solids
vary so greatly in weight that they can hardly be estimated
in this way :
1 teaspoonful = 1 to 2 drams
1 dessert-spoonful .. .. = 3 to 4 drams
1 table-spoonful .. .. = £to 1 ounce
1 egg-cupful = lj to 1J ounces
1 cupful (small) .. .. =sto 7 ounces
1 cupful (large) .. .. =Bto 11 ounces
1 tumblerful (average) .. = J pint (Imperial)

TO ESTIMATE THE DEAD WEIGHT OF CATTLE.
Measurements required (in feet) :
(1) Girth.
(2) Distance from the fore part of the shoulder
blade to the tail-head.
Calculation :
(1) Square the girth and multiply by 5 times the
length.
(2) Divide the product by 21.
The answer gives the weight of the four quarters in
terms of stones of 14 lbs. Very fat cattle weigh about
one-twentieth more, and lean cattle about one-twentieth
less than the result obtained by the above method. The
relationship between live and dead weight is shown
below.
DEAD AND LIVE WEIGHT
Sixty-four lbs. of carcass and 48 lbs. of offal per 1 cwt.
is the usual estimate in the case of both fat cattle and fat
sheep. The butcher’s stone is therefore reckoned at
8 lbs., and the price of 8 lbs. deadweight is equivalent to
the stone of 14 lbs. liveweight.
TO FIND AREA OF IRREGULARLY-SHAPED
PADDOCK.
Divide the area into triangles.
Measure the sides of the triangles.
The area of each triangle can then be ascertained from
the following formula :
Area = N s (s~a) (s-b) (s-c)
where s = £ sum of the, sides a, b and c.
ELECTRICAL MEASURES.;
The chief unite as generally accepted by electricians
are as follows :
Volt .. .. Electromotive force is equal to about
92-6 per cent, of that given by one
Daniell's battery cell.
Ohm .. .. Resistance equals the resistance offered
to the passage of a current of electricity
by a thread of mercury 106 cm. long
and 1 mm. cross section at the tem-
perature of melting ice.
Megohm .. Equals one million ohms.
Ampere .. Current equals the current 1 volt will
drive through 1 ohm.
Coulomb .. Quantity equals 1 ampere flowing for
1 second of time.
Microfarad .. Capacity equals -000001 coulomb at
1 volt pressure.
Watt .. .. Power equals 44 ft. lbs. per minute.
Board of Trade Unit, officially defined as “ the energy
contained in a current of one thousand amperes flowing
under an electromotive force of 1 volt during an hour.”
Kilowatt equals one Board of Trade Unit. One Board
of Trade Unit will keep a 16-candle incandescent lamp
alight for about 16 hours.
746 watts equals 1 horse-power.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PAINTING.
Contrary to the common belief, the most important
coat of paint on any job is the first or priming coat. It
is to the finish what the foundation is to a building. If
this foundation breaks down the building goes with it
and the same is true of a painting job.
Especially on wood, the first coat of paint should be
rubbed well in and allowed to thoroughly dry before the
succeeding coats are applied, each of which should be
brushed out thoroughly and be quite dry before the
application of another coat.
Two even coats, thoroughly dry, will give much better
results than one heavy coat.
See that the surface is free from grease and dirt. If
the job has been previously painted and is peeling, scaling
off or cracking, bum off all the old paint.
See that the surface is perfectly dry. Moisture causes
blistering, cracking, scaling and light troubles.
A pitchy surface should be treated either by burning
or sealing with orange shellac. All knots should be
carefully shellacked.
Paint should always be well stirred before being used,
and should be kept covered when not in use.
To secure best results from any good prepared paint
it must be properly mixed. First, shake the package
violently. Secondly, remove the lid. Thirdly, pour off
into another clean package all the liquid which has come
to the surface. Fourthly, stir the pigment and the remain-
ing oil with a strong, smooth paddle, the shape of which
permits getting round the edges and bringing up the
pigment. Stir until the mass is smooth and entirely
uniform throughout. Fifthly, add the liquid, a little at
a time, stirring constantly until all the liquid has been
returned. Sixthly, then “ box ” the paint, pouring it
back and forth from one pail to another half a dozen
to a dozen times, each time leaving about a quarter of
the paint in the pail which is being emptied.
Brushes should never be put into water. Those used
for house painting should be kept in raw Linseed Oil
and varnishing brushes should be left in varnish and
before using should be thoroughly washed out in pure
Turpentine.

MEASURE THE CAPACITY OF DIPPING
BATH.
It is absolutely essential that the correct quantity of
clean water in the bath be known, to ensure successful
dipping. The following simple rule will enable anyone
to ascertain the exact quantity of wash his dipping bath
contains, i.e. :
Take the measurement at the water-line and the
measurement at the bottom in inches, add together and
divide by two ; this will give the average length of the
dip in lineal inches. Take the breadth at the water line
and at the bottom in inches, add together and divide the
result by two, and this will give the average width of
the bath. Multiply the average length in inches, by
the average width in inches, and multiply the result by
the depth in inches, from the water line to the bottom.
This gives the cubic contents in inches. Divide by 277
and the result will be the contents of your bath in imperial
gallons.
Water line (length) 720 inches.
Bottom ~ .. .. . - 540 ~
Water line (width) .. .. .. 22 ~

Length at water line 720 inches, at bottom 540 inches
720 + 540 4 2 = 630 inches average length.
Width at water line 22 inches, at bottom 10 inches
= 22 -f 10 -4- 2 = 16 inches average width.
630 x 16 x 60 -4 277 = 2,183 gallons.
Note. —One gallon measures 277 J cubic inches.
WALL PAPERS
EFFECT OF COLOUR ON LIGHT.
The question is often asked “ What is the best colour
for Wallpapers or Hangings ? ” The following Table
will give the fullest particulars. Common Wallpapers
tested in an Illuminating Laboratory for the light-
absorbing qualities have given the following results :
This Table shows that if a room papered with dark
green be re-papered with Chrome Yellow, it will be four
times as light with the same lamps and windows. In
many cases householders pay too much for electricity
and gas lighting because their light-absorbing wall
coverings destroy the light rays.
Wallpaper is made in rolls 12 yards long, 21 inches wide.

COLOURING OF CEMENT MORTAR.
For concrete restoration of footpaths, walls, fish
ponds, etc.
As Portland cement is strongly basic in character and
contains free lime, the range of pigments is confined to
basic oxides and some of the ochres which are unaffected
by lime known as “ Lime-proof.”
Ochre is usually a clayey earth impregnated with an
oxide, and should be used with caution, as an excess of
ochre will seriously reduce strength.
A pure white is only obtained by use of white Portland
cement mixed with either white sand, crushed white
quartz, ground marble or ground white limestone.
Following are pigments most suitable for use :
A steel floating trowel gives a darker colour than a
wooden float.
A concrete cured in sunlight will give a lighter colour
than one cured in the shade.
Trowelling on partly hardened surfaces causes colour
blotches.

WATER.
1 pint pure water weighs lbs.
1 gallon pure water contains 277*274 cubic ins.
1 cubic ft. distilled water, 62deg., Fahr., weighs 62*321 lbs.
1 cubic yard distilled water, 62 deg. Fahr., weighs J ton.
1 cubic fathom distilled water, 62 deg. Fahr., weighs
6 tons.
TO COMPUTE THE CAPACITY OF A TANK.
SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR.—MuItipIy the length
by the breadth and the product by the depth ; the result
multiplied by 6J (6*2321) will give the base and contents
in gallons.
CIRCULAR. —Rule A : Multiply the circumference by
itself and the product by half the height.
Example. —Circumference 20 ft., height 6 ft.
20 ft. x 20 ft. x 3 ft. 1,200 gals, approximate
capacity.
Rule B : Multiply the diameter by itself and the pro-
duct by five times the height.
Example. —Diameter 6 ft., height 6 ft.
6 ft. x 6 ft. x 30 ft. = 1,080 gals, approximate capacity.
TO ASCERTAIN EXCAVATED AREA OF
GROUND TANK.
Sum of top area X sum of bottom area.
Add top and bottom lengths 2.
Add top and bottom breadths -y 2.
Multiply sum of length and breadth = Area half way.
Multiply area half way by 4 = four times area half way.
Sum of top and bottom area x sum of 4 times area
half way.
Multiply by depth.
Divide by 6 = cubic feet.
Divide by 27 = cubic yards.
Example.—
Tank 80 X 76 top area.
38 X 32 bottom area.
6ft. 9in. depth.
80ft. x 76ft. = 6,080 ft. top area.
38ft. x 32ft. —1,216 ft. bottom area.
. 7.296 ft. sum of top and bottom area.
80 ft. X 38ft. -y 2 = 59ft. top and bottom lengths.
76ft. X 32ft. 2 —54 ft. top and bottom breadths.
59 X 54, 3,186 = area half way.
Area half way, 3,186 ft. x 4 = 12,744, 4 times area half
way.
12,744 x 7,296 sum of top and bottom areas —20,040 ft.
20,040 x 6 depth -- 6ft. 9in,, 22,545 cubic feet.
22,545 cubic feet -y 27 835 cubic yards.
FORMULA FOR ASCERTAINING CONTENTS
OF HAYSTACKS IN TONS.
To ascertain the number of cubic feet contained in each
stack, multiply the length, breadth, and height * ; or if
the stack is round, multiply half circumference, half
diameter, and height together, which will give the desired
result- Having ascertained the number of cubic feet,
it remains to find their equivalent in tons, which is done
by dividing the number of cubic feet by the number of
cubic feet in a ton, according to the following table :
It will be borne in mind that the longer hay is stacked
the more compact it becomes ; hence more feet to the
ton are allowed to a new stack than to one three months
old, and so on.
Table showing number of cubic feet per ton to be allowed
according to age of haystack.
* As a portion of the stack is in the sloping top it is
accounted for by adding one-third of the height from the
eaves to the ridge or pinnacle if stack is round, to the
measurement from the ground to the eaves, thus : —
Height to eaves, 8 feet; height from eaves to the ridge,
or pinnacle, 6 feet; add one-third of 6 feet, viz., 2 feet;
total height for calculating contents, 10 feet.

LIME MORTAR.
Lime Mortar of good quality will result from mixing one
bag or 2 cwt. of fresh burnt lime with 25 cubic feet sand
and will lay about 1,000 bricks. If additional stability
is required it is advisable to add 10 per cent, of cement,
which will more than repay its cost in the robustness of
the job. . J

MATERIALS REQUIRED —Portland Cement, Sand,
Crushed Stone or Gravel, Water.
EQUIPMENT REQUIREDShoveI. Mixing Board,
Measuring Box, Watering Can.
1. Sand or Fine Aggregate : — Clean sand is measured in
the measuring box and spread on the mixing platform.
The platform should be substantially made of tongued
and grooved boards or heavy sheets of Plain Gal-
vanized Iron.
2. Portland Cement : —A paper bag contains one cubic
foot. A jute bag 1J cubic feet. The right amount of
cement is spread over the fine aggregate. Don’t guess
at quantities.
B. Mixing Fine aggregate and cement are thoroughly
mixed by turning over with shovels until the colour
is uniform before adding coarse aggregate and water.
4. Stone or Coarse Aggregate :—Pebbles or broken atone
are measured in the same way, spread on top, and the
mixing process repeated until the colour is again
uniform.
5. Water : —Water is added slowly in a depression in the
centre of the pile and mixed as it is added until the
mixture is a quaky jelly-like consistency. Don’t
use too much water.
6. Place at Once :—When the concrete is thoroughly
mixed, place it at once in the forms. The hardening
process begins soon after the addition of the water
and the concrete must not be disturbed once it is
well under way.
7. Curing .* —As soon as it is placed, protect the concrete
against drying out by covering. When hard enough
to resist finger impressions, sprinkle with water and
keep it moist for several days.
NOTE.—AII materials, especially sand, must be clean.
Any water that is fit to drink is suitable for use.
Concrete :—Portland Cement, 24 paper bags to the ton.
Rich Mixture :— 1 cement, 1J sand, 3 metal. For columns,
structural parts subject to high stresses, also water-
tight work.
Standard Mixture 1 cement, 2 sand, 4 metal. For piers,
reinforced floors, machine foundations, subject to
vibration.
Medium Mixture : —1 cement, sand, 5 metal. Ordinary
machine foundations, retaining walls ; ordinary floors.
Lean Mixture : —1 cement, 3 sand, 6 metal. Unimportant
masses for heavy walls, large foundations, supporting
stationary loads.
If using a concrete mixer, add ingredients as follows
1 st —Water 3rd—Sand
2nd —Metal 4th —Cement.
Revolve at about 20 r.p.m. after last ingredient has
been added, for at least l£ minutes, and 2 minutes for
important work"
For good work carefully avoid excess water, a wet or
sloppy mixture may result in a percentage of the cement
being lost.
Colouring : —Add 1 lb. of best English oxide to each
cubic yard cement. Colour may be varied by adding
vegetable black or yellow ochre.
Adhesive strength of steel to concrete is 670/670 lbs.
per square inch over surface area.
Materials for 1 cubic yard cement : —1 paper bag
cement 1 cubic foot.
HOW TO MAKE CONCRETE.
The circumference of a circle =
22
diameter X (or 3-1416):
7
Area of a circle = square of the diameter x 0-7854.
The area of a square, rhombus, or rhomboid = base
X height.
The area of a triangle = \ base X perpendicular height.
Area of trapezoid = J sura of two parallel sides x height.
Area of any right-lined figure of four or more unequal
sides is found by dividing it into triangles, finding area of
each, and adding together.
For any regular polygon, inscribe a circle ; then £ radius
of that circle x length of one side x number of sides
= area.
The area of a parabola = base x height x 2/3rds.
The area of an ellipse = long axis x short axis x 0-7854.
Surface and cubic content of prism or cylinder —Ist
(area of two ends) -j- {length X perimeter) surface ;
2nd, area of base x height = content.
For a cone or pyramid —Ist, 4 (slant height X perimeter
of base) x area of base = surface ; 2nd, l/3rd (area of
base x perpendicular height) = content.
For a cube or parailelopipedon Ist, sum of areas of
all the sides = surface ; 2nd, length X breadth x depth
= content.
For a sphere—Ist, square of diameter X 3*1416
= surface ; 2nd, cube of diameter X 0-5236 = content.
Area of sector of circle = length of arc X radius.
Area of segment of circle area of sector, less area of
triangle.
Side of square of area equal circle == diameter X 0-8852.
Diameter of circle equal in area to square side
X 11284.

HORSEPOWER TRANSMITTED BY LEATHER BELTING.
Table giving number of horsepower transmitted by belts one inch wide considering the effects of centrifugal force,
so that the tension on belt is constant at all speeds.
Note. —This table is based on an effective pull of
45 pounds per inch of width for single belts inch thick ;
80 pounds for double belts f inch thick; 110 pounds
for triple belts inch thick ; and 145 pounds for 4-ply
belts J inch thick. The table shows that there is no
advantage in running belts faster than 4400 to 4800 feet
per minute, due to the action of the centrifugal force.
In all the above data it is assumed that the arc of '
contact of the belt is not less than 180 degrees. ;

RULES FOR CALCULATING DIAMETERS AND SPEEDS OF PULLEYS
SPEED OF DRIVEN PULLEY REQUIRED.
Diameter and speed of driving pulley, and diameter
of driven pulley are known. Rule : Multiply the diameter
of the driving pulley by its speed in revolutions per
minute, and divide the product by the diameter of the
driven pulley.
Example : —lf the diameter of the driving pulley is
15 inches and its speed, 180 revolutions per minute, and
the diameter of the driven pulley, 9 inches, then the
speed of the driven pulley
15 X 180
= = 300 revolutions per minute.
9
DIAMETER OF DRIVEN PULLEY REQUIRED.
Diameter and speed of driving pulley, and revolutions
per minute of driven pulley are known. Rule : Multiply
the diameter of the driving pulley by its speed in revolu-
tions per minute, and divide the product by the required
speed of the driven pulley.
Example : —lf the diameter of the driving pulley is
24 inches and its speed, 100 revolutions per minute,
and the driven pulley is to rotate 600 revolutions per
minute, then the diameter of the driven pulley
24 X 100
_ = 4 inches.
600
DIAMETER OF DRIVING PULLEY
REQUIRED.
Diameter and speed of driven pulley, and speed of
driving pulley are known. Rule : Multiply the diameter
of the driven pulley by its speed in revolutions per minute,
and divide the product by the speed of the driving pulley.
Example ; —lf the diameter of the driven pulley is
36 inches and its required speed, 150 revolutions per
minute, and the speed of the driving pulley is 600 revolu-
tions per minute, then the diameter of the driving pulley
36 x 150
= 9 inches.
600
SPEED OF DRIVING PULLEY REQUIRED.
Diameters of driving and driven pulleys, and speed
of driven pulley are known. Rule ; Multiply the diameter
of the driven pulley by its speed, and divide the product
by the diameter of the driving pulley.
Example ; —lf the diameter of driven pulley is 4 inches,
its required speed, 800 revolutions per minute, and the
diameter of the driver, 26 inches, then the required speed
of the driver
4 X 800
= = 123 revolutions per minute,
26 approximately.
TO KEEP BELTING PLIABLE.
Leather Belts. —Clean thoroughly and dress with
Neatsfoot oil. The smooth or hair side of belt should
always be run in contact with the pulley, as there is more
“ give ” to the flesh side of leather.
Canvas Belts. —Clean with soap and water, and give
frequent applications of good quality belt dressing.
Avoid using resin, dirt, cinders, etc., to prevent belt
slipping. It is important to prevent edges of canvas
belts from rubbing.
Rubber Belts. —Always run with vulcanised seam away
from the pulley. Rubber belts are less susceptible to
moisture than leather belts, but should be cleaned
frequently. They will give better service and last longer
if kept free from belt dressings.

THE AGE OF A HORSE
To tell the age of every horse,
Inspect the lower jaw of course ;
The six front teeth the tale will tell
And any doubt and fear dispel.
Two middle “ nippers ” you behold
Before the colt is two weeks old ;
Before eight weeks, two more will come ;
Eight months, the “ corners ” cut the gum.
Two outside grooves will disappear,
From middle two in just one year ;
In two years from the second ..pair,
In three the “ corners ” too, are bare.
At two the middle “ nippers ” drop,
At three, the second pair can’t stop ;
When four years old the third pair goes ;
At five, a full new set he shows.
The deep black spots will pass from view
At six years from the middle two;
The second pair at seven years ;
At eight, the spot each “ corner ” clears.
From middle “ nippers ” upper jaw
At nine, the black spots will withdraw ;
The second pair at ten are white ;
Eleven finds the “ corner ” light.
As time goes on the horsemen know,
The oval teeth three sided grow ;
They longer get, project before
Till twenty, when we know no more.
SAFE WORKING LOADS FOR LIFTING
GEAR
NOTE. —Be sure of your weight and sling before you lift, take
careful notice that the greater angle of your sling from the vertical
the more load you are putting on it. The safe loads given are
for each single leg of rope or chain. When used double or in
any other multiple, the loads may be increased proportionately.
PREPARATION OF WOOL FOR MARKET
SMALL CLIPS.
Farmers’ lots of wool do not as a rule realize full market
value, owing to want of uniformity in the “ GET UP.”
If the following suggestions are acted upon, it will amply
repay the trouble incurred, and give the buyers confidence
in bidding for the small clips :
The sheep should not be shorn until they are quite
dry.
The fleeces should be carefully and fully skirted —no
locks or pieces being left on the fleece —neatly roiled and
packed in a bale.
Care- should be taken to keep the fleece before and
after shearing quite free from straw, chaff, etc.
All discoloured, dingy, coarse, cotted or double fleeces
should be packed in separate bags or bales, and not
mixed with the good fleeces.
Fine wool should be kept separate from coarse, but
if there should not be sufficient of each to fill a bale,
the different qualities should be put into fadges and
kept separate.
Bellies, as well as pieces and locks, should be kept
separate from the fleece, and where the flock is sufficiently
large to warrant the distinction, belly pieces may be
packed separately from other pieces. The stained part
should be picked out.
Locks and pieces should not be packed with fleece
to fill a bale, but should be kept in a separate bale, fadge,
or bag, but the fadge or bag can be put into the bale,
if there is room, to save cost of carriage ; but woolbrokers
must be advised if the wool is so packed.
Broken fleeces, burry and seedy parts should be care-
fully separated from sound fleeces.
The bales should be neatly sewn up after being packed,
branded and numbered. Care should be taken to put
the brand on with stencil plates and ink.
Particulars of each bale should be sent to woolbrokers,
so that they may know what they contain. If con-
venient, the description should be put on each bale, viz. :
X-Bred Fleece, Fine. X-Bred Fleece, Coarse. £-Bred
Pieces. X-Bred Pieces. Medium, Fleecy, etc.

CAPACITIES OF TANKS
TO ENSURE CLEAN DRINKING WATER.
Many people, even in cities with a good public
water supply laid on, prefer rain water for drinking, but
this becomes positively dangerous unless it is kept clean.
Whenever rain falls in sufficient quantities to fill the tank
the tap should be turned on while the rain is falling.
The dirty water then passes out at the bottom, and is
replaced by the clean fresh water from the roof. In
this way tank water can be kept safe for drinking even
in a large town.
GETTING RID OF FLIES.
Treacle on a saucer, or treacle smeared on sheets of
paper will attract and kill flies. If a small quantity, say
the equivalent of a teaspoonful, of carbolic acid be poured
on a hot shovel it will drive the flies from the room.
WEIGHT OF HAYSTACK.
To compute the approximate weight of a haystack
multiply the average length of stack by the average width
and multiply the product by the average height. You
thus get the capacity in cubic feet. From this calculate
the approximate weight by dividing at the rate of 520
cubic feet to the ton for freshly stacked hay, 420 cubic
feet to the ton for six-months-old hay, and 350 cubic feet
to the ton for old hay.
ERADICATION OF ANTS.
Arsenic is perhaps the best substance to use in the
eradication of ants, but it is very poisonous. Place one
ounce of ordinary arsenic in an iron pot with one quart
of water, and boil till the quantity is reduced to half its
bulk. Then add half a pound of brown sugar. This
may then be dropped about the runs and around the
nests of the ants, or placed in saucers where they are
known to congregate.
Carbolic acid diluted with about 10. times its bulk of
water is another good remedy, and fresh ground lime is
also good.
A simple trap is made by placing near the nests freshly
cooked bones, to which a little meat is adhering. They
will quickly be covered with the pests, which may then
be destroyed.
FODDER MEASUREMENTS.
Accuracy is needed in feeding concentrates to animals
or poultry. The following table cuts out guess work.
1 bushel equals 8 gallons, equals 32 quarts.
1 kerosene tin (4 gallons) equals half a bushel.
A box 4 in. x 4 in. x 4 in. equals 1 quart.
A box 6 in. x 6 in. x 6 in. equals 1 gallon.
A box 12 in. x 12 in. x 15J in. equals 1 bushel.
Inside measurements are followed.
INTERESTING INFORMATION


THE MAKING OF GATES.
Gates should always be swung independent of the fence,
on good heavy posts placed four feet in the ground, with
a sill log in between. The hinges, which should be strong,
are generally placed in a vertical line. Occasionally, it
is desirable that the foot of a gate should lift when
opened, and this can be arranged by placing the lower
hinge half an inch off the plumb in the opening direction.
The following materials are required to make a double
five-barred bolted gate for a 12 foot opening without
any mortising :
112 running feet of 3-inch by l-inch or 4-inch by
1-inch timber ;
3 lb. of by f-inch bolts and washers ;
2 pairs hook and eye hinges 2 feet by 2 inch by -^--inch.
Butts and heads should be cut 4 feet long, and should
be double—that is, placed on each side of the bars. The
bottom of the first rail should be 3 inches from the bottom
of the upright. The distance between the first and
second rails should be 6 inches ; between second and
third, 6 inches ; between third and fourth, 7 inches;
and between fourth and fifth, 8 inches. There should be
two double stays on either side of rails on each gate
running from the bottom of the butt to the top of the head.
When hinges are being placed in position small pieces
of 3-inch by I-inch timber should be inserted against the
rails for packing purposes. A sliding piece of 3-inch by
1-inch timber along the third rail between the stay and
the head makes an excellent fastener. Gates are not
completed until they have been painted and if the first
, two coats are given before the gates are put together,
a considerable amount of time will be saved.
WEIGHT OF SEEDS TO BUSHEL.
The following are the selling weights of various farm
seeds ; —Grass seeds, lucerne, and clover, 20 lb.; oats,
40 lb.; maize, 56 lb. ; buck wheat, barley, broom com,
50 lb. ; wheat, beans, sorghum, peas, millet, rye, amber
cane, tares and vetches, 60 lb.
FINDING THE POSITIVE POLE
OF A BATTERY.
Enthusiasts new to radio may not know that there is
a method of finding the positive lead of any electrical
power supply by a quick and infallible method.
Cut a potato in half, and push the two leads, J inch apart,
into the inside of the potato. A green ring will appear
around the positive lead.
FINDING THE NEGATIVE POLE
OF A BATTERY.
A simple and sure method requires only a little common
salt dissolved in water in a glass. When the ends of the
wires are placed in the solution, bubbles will form round
the negative wire and nothing will happen at the positive
wire.
EASY METHOD OF REMOVING PAINT.
Waterglass, a common chemical often used for pre-
serving eggs, is a cheap and effective agent for removing
paint from furniture. It is applied with a brush and
allowed to stand for about ten minutes, after which the
paint can easily be removed with an ordinary scrubbing
brush.
PAINTING ON GALVANIZED IRON.
In painting galvanized iron, corrugated or otherwise,
new iron should be painted over with a solution of copper
sulphate in the proportions of four ounces to a gallon of
water. When dry, the iron should be painted with a good
metal paint. If these directions are followed, the work
done will last for several years.
DRESSING FOR CORRUGATED IRON.
The following dressing is made by thoroughly mixing
cement with fresh skim milk to bring it to the consistency
of ordinary oil paint. It can then be applied with any
cheap whitewash brush. It will dry in twenty minutes or
so, and after this interval it will stand heavy rain. Any
colour can be added to the wash. This dressing not only
prolongs the life of corrugated iron quite as well as paint,
or tar, at a fraction of the cost, but also acts as a non-
conductor of heat and cold. We know that corrugated
iron, if unlined, makes a building very hot in summer and
cold in winter, but this milk cement dressing especially
after several coats, makes an enormous difference, and
keeps a building much cooler in summer and much warmer
in winter.
SETTING BOLTS AND WOOD
IN CONCRETE.
For setting rods and bolts in position in holes drilled
in stone and concrete, melted sulphur is often used.
When concrete is poured around posts it is likely to
crack unless some type of resilient joint is provided between
the two materials. Such a joint can be made by wrapping
corrugated cardboard around the post before pouring the
concrete. The cardboard is removed after the concrete
sets, and tar or asphalt poured in the opening.
TO MAKE KANGAROO GREENHIDE.
Kangaroo greenhide is useful for many purposes for
which cowhide is too heavy. To prepare it, roll the skin
into a tight bundle and bury it in sand.
In a couple of days the hair will scrape off easily.
Then peg out, and brush over now and again with vinegar,
using about a pint altogether. Afterwards hang the hide
in a shed for two or three months before using.
TO DARKEN BRIDLE AND SADDLE.
Cover with bread and milk for about fifteen minutes
Brush off, and apply castor oil quickly.
WATER-PUMP PACKING OF RAWHIDE.
Shafts on centrifugal water pumps sometimes score or
wear down in grooves, which soon grind out the packing.
This trouble can be overcome by substituting rawhide
for the regular packing material as it will wear longer and
when wet, swells and seals the pump so that no water
can leak out. It is essential that all the hair be removed
from the hide.

returns quick and certain profits to the owners. Add to
this the personal satisfaction in handling well-conditioned
plants.
On the strength of over 50 years’ experience, w’e offer
the following suggestions, which, however, are not intended
to supersede makers’ instructions books. We sincerely
hope the following hints will be of value.
ENGINES
Installation. — Bolt down securely to concrete
foundations. Engine should be level and in alignment
with the machine being driven.
Tighten up holding down bolts periodically.
Neglect of the above precautions will cause excessive
vibration and wear.
Fuel. —Use only the fuel recommended by the manu-
facturers, straining to remove dirt, water, or other foreign
matter. Dirty fuel causes blockages in pipes and car-
burettor jets, resulting in erratic running and stoppages.
Lubrication. —Check oil in the crank case regularly,
•hanging if necessary. Use only lubricating oil recom-
mended in engine instruction book.
Use of unsuitable oil causes unnecessary wear and
deposit of carbon in the cylinder.
Cooling Water. —Make sure cooling water is kept above
the top or outlet pipe in water tank, and that water
circulates freely.
Neglect means overheating and excessive wear.
Drain cylinder water jacket in frosty weather, otherwise
there is a danger of cylinder becoming cracked.
Laying up Engine. —When not in use, stop engine on
top centre position, with both inlet and exhaust valves
closed, thus relieving the valve springs of strain, and
preventing formation of rust, due to moisture entering
cylinder.
Instruction Book. —Carry out the makers’ recommenda-
tions, keeping Instruction Book in good condition and
handy for reference.
Ordering Spare Parts. —Specify name of engine, horse
power, engine number, type, also catalogue number and
description of part required when ordering spare parts.
WINDMILLS.
Many of the troubles encountered with windmills can
be traced to faulty installations. Should the owner install
his own mill, he should understand the maker’s printed
instructions thoroughly before he starts, and follow them
faithfully. If a mechanic is employed insist that he
do likewise.
Foundations. —There is nothing like good concrete
foundations and they justify the little extra cost involved.
Lubrication. —Make sure that oil recommended by the
makers is used, and check oil level at least twice a year.
Every two years drain off the old oil and replace with
new. Never use old sump or similar waste oil. Grease
lubricated mills should be treated according to the maker’s
special instructions.
Tighten Nuts. —Check over and tighten all nuts in the
wheel and tower above the platform twice a year ; also
nuts on mill head. Tighten all nuts in mill and tower
once a year.
Whenever pump output appears to dwindle, examine
plunger bucket and replace with a new one—before the
metal plunger touches and cuts the pump cylinder. The
footvalve should be kept clear of silt or other rubbish.
If an air chamber is used it should be drained of water
when there is a tendency to water-hammer. Make sure
the pump remains always plumb under the mill.
CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS.
With centrifugal pumps it is particularly important
that the installation should be thoroughly carried out.
Many such pumps have been wrongly condemned because
of faulty installation. The outstanding cause of trouble is
failure to support the suction and delivery pipes independ-
ently of the pump. If any strain is imposed on the pump
bowl from the suction or delivery pipes, the bowl will be
imperceptibly distorted. The result is hot bearings,
burnt out gland packing, and greatly increased load on
the driving engine. Such a pump will never give good
performance.
To avoid hot bearings the belt should not be unduly
tight. The suction and delivery pipes should rise to and
from the pump respectively, the grade being not less than
1 foot in 12 feet. Pipes used should not be smaller than
the connection to the pump ; unless the pipes are short
in length, they should be increased in size, but to what
extent is a matter for calculation and the advice of an
expert should be sought on this point.
Lubrication should be given special attention according
to the type of bearings employed, and in accordance with
the maker’s instructions. Great care should be taken in
packing the gland of the pump correctly so that when
tightened up it will not place an undue load on the
engine on the one hand, or on the other hand allow air
to enter the bowl and thus destroy the efficiency of the
pump.
OPERATION AND CARE OF MILKING
MACHINES.
The following points should be borne in mind when
operating a milking plant as their adoption or rejection
will make all the difference between their success or failure
in operation.
The vacuum reading on the vacuum gauge should never
exceed 15 inches and cows have been milked quite success-
fully with a vacuum as low as 12 inches.
It is just a matter of what the cows have become used
to and we suggest that a low vacuum be utilised at first
and if the cows respond to this quite satisfactorily do
not increase it.
The rate of pulsation can be anything between 40 and
45 per minute, but it is unwise to exceed the 45 as from
then on a higher rate of pulsation has a tendency to
decrease the efficiency of the machine.
A pulsation speed of about 43 has been found to be
the most effective.
INTERESTING INFORMATION


Always see that the inflations in the teat cup are kept
tight, as when they become soft and flabby through use,
the milking is not nearly as fast or effective as when the
inflations are tight. This is also the reason why at
times the cows will not respond to the machines as they
should.
When the inflations become slack, tighten them by
cutting off a small portion at the nipple end, and when
the teat cups are assembled again it will be found that
the inflations are quite tight.
The successful functioning of milking machinery largely
depends on the manner in which they are cleaned. Too
much importance cannot be attached to the necessity of
having the whole system maintained in a thoroughly
sanitary and sweet condition.
It is impossible to obtain a super-fine grade of cream
if the plant is dirty because the milk will become con-
taminated, and for this reason it is always advisable to
have ample boiling {not hot) water available for cleaning
or better still, install a steriliser which will enable the
whole of the milking plant to be sterilised with saturated
steam.
Always keep a utensil of water in the bail, and a clean
cloth with which to wash the cow’s teats before the teat
cups are put into position. A few grains of perman-
ganate of potash (Condy’s Crystals) added to this washing
water will add greatly to its effectiveness.
It is recommended to start the milk from each teat
before putting the cups on, as by this method of starting
by hand a sore or inflamed teat can be readily detected,
as the cow invariably flinches should any soreness or
tenderness be apparent.
Comprehensive and general instructions in detail are
provided with each Moffat-Virtue Milking Plant that
is sent out, but the foregoing are just a general resume
without any elaboration.
SHEEP SHEARING MACHINERY
On completion of the general shearing, remove all belts
and down tubes, storing away from dust and dampness.
Care being taken to make box rat and mouse proof.
Cover the overhead gears by protecting same from dust
and grit, also birds, wasps, etc.
Check over hand pieces and other equipment, and
compile a list of spare parts required for the following
shearing, and post order in ample time, so that parts will
be on hand prior to the commencement of shearing. Hand
pieces showing excessive wear should be forwarded to
us for repair, stating name and address of owner, when
required, and forwarding instructions. When ordering
spare parts, specify the make and type of machinery,
also quote catalogue numbers and description of parts.
It is advisable to tighten up all planking and bracket
bolts, also check alignment of shafting before commencing
shearing. The wooden planking may have warped or
sunk slightly between the shearings, which would cause
a mis-alignment of shafting and overhead bearings. Now
this applies mainly to plain bearing installations.
Only first-quality sheep shearing machine oil should
be used, as the cutters oscillate across the comb about
6,000 times per minute.
Attention to these details will avoid unnecessary incon.
venience and loss of time next shearing.
ELECTRIC LIGHTING PLANTS
A very common question is “ How can I get the best
results from my lighting plant ? ” This can be sum-
marised in condensed form as follows :
1. Have the plant installed by an efficient tradesman.
This cost is fully justified.
2. Accommodate plant in clean building and keep it
free from oil, dust and grit.
3. Periodically check all bolts and nuts around the
plant for tightness. Keep all electrical con-
nections tight.
4. Do not interfere with adjustments of relays, etc.
unless justified.
5. Do not experiment with the electrical system.
Consult your instruction book or the manu-
facturers.
6. Take all precautions against short circuits, as
they are ruinous to equipment and battery.
7. Place battery on substantial rack and keep clean.
8. Check battery connecting bolts and keep free
from corrosion. If any joints show heat; remove,
clean and replace, using vaseline on all contact
feces to prevent corrosion.
9. Never excessively overcharge, or over discharge
the battery ; work within specific gravity range
given on instruction card. Never add sulphuric
acid unless jar is leaking. Use only pure distilled
water.
10. Never overload your plant beyond rated capacity
or be neglectful of your consuming appliances.
This means depreciation and shortens the life of
Plant considerably.
11. Periodically inspect the generator brushes and
commutator for any undue wear and bad contact
face. Keep brush holders free from carbon dust.
12. Help the plant to give its maximum efficiency by
eliminating vibration, practising cleanliness, and
refraining from experimenting, overloading, etc.
Refer to special notes on engine, page 28.

continuous with the body.
3. Nos. 1 and 2 one at either side—locking hands under-
neath the shoulders and hips, raise the patient,
carry him forward over the stretcher, and then lower
him on it.
4. No. 3 takes charge of the injured portion (limb or
head) and steadies it with a hand on either side of
the wound.
5. Nos. 1 and 2 then take their places at the head and
foot of the stretcher, lift, and carry off, while No. 3
walks at side of stretcher.
SIGNS OF BROKEN BONES.
Motion at the part; crackling sensation on moving
broken ends; alteration in shape; often shortening.
Always apply splints before lifting or carrying. Dangers
are of pushing the end through flesh, blood vessels,
nerves, or internal organs (lungs).
Splints may be formed of soldiers’ weapons—rifles,
swords and scabbards —umbrellas, walking-sticks, broom
handles, folded newspapers, etc. Bandages from handker-
chiefs, sheets and shirts. Stretchers from doors, ladders,
or two rifles and a blanket.
Country residents who wish to form a class in practical FIRST AID are invited to write direct
to the Secretary, St. John Ambulance, for full information.
HINTS ON FIRST AID TO THE INJURED-cont/nued


GENERAL MEDICAL
ABDOMINAL INJURIES may proceed from internal
injuries, occasioning collapse and dangerous haemor-
rhage. Put the patient to bed and apply ice, emptying
the bladder, and administering brandy to combat
immediate collapse, pending the arrival of medical
assistance.
ABSCESS. —A collection of purulent matter in the
tissues of the body, occasioning swelling external or
internal. It is desirable that the fluid should be got
rid of, and this may be accomplished by lancing and
pressure, by fomentation, or by the application of hot
poultices and antiseptic treatment. Abscesses are
frequently the result of a blow or other violence,
frequently also they follow weakening illness, the most
common cause being infection by certain germs.
AGUE is accompanied in most cases by enlargement of
the spleen. In the cold stage give thin warm drinks
frequently, and apply hot water bottles to the feet,
placing the patient between blankets. Sponging the
body with tepid water and the administration of
cooling drinks should be the staple of treatment in the
hot dry stage, and when sweating succeeds, rest and
lukewarm draughts to assuage thirst are necessary.
Quinine is one of the best preventative and curative
agents in relation to ague.
ANAEMIA is caused by defective or insufficient food,
bad atmospheric conditions, and constipation, and is
more common in females than in males. The symptoms
are a pale complexion, colourless lips and gums, and
general exhaustion, accompanied by palpitation, head-
ache, and pains in the back and left side. The patient
should be given plenty of fresh air and fair amount of
exercise. A plain and nourishing diet should also be
adopted, including a moderate proportion of animal
food. Regular action of the bowels should also be
induced, and with these precautions, steel drops, or
iron pills may be administered with advantage.
APPENDICITIS. —Pain and tenderness in lower right
front of abdomen, often beginning in pit of stomach,
accompanied at times by vomiting and fever. For
temporary relief apply hot fomentations. No purgatives.
Slight sips of water may be taken. Await medical
advice.
APOPLEXY, —Act on the bowels, apply wet cloths to
the head, undo collar.
ASTHMA. —A spasmodic affection of the bronchial tubes,
is productive of extreme difficulty in breathing.
Patients require careful dieting and constant attention
to the regular action of the digestive organs. When
the spasms are particularly troublesome, relief may
often be obtained from inhalation of the fumes of
burning blotting paper previously saturated with a
solution of nitre, or a few drops of chloroform upon a
handkershief may be placed to the nostrils. A com-
pound liniment of belladonna, camphor, soap and
opium, applied by friction to the chest, is comforting.
BED-SORES should be guarded against in lingering illness ;
the provision of a “ water-bed,” or pneumatic cushions,
which compel equal pressure, being capital preventa-
tives. When a bed-sore threatens to form, there should
be frequent and gentle washing of the part with warm
water, and careful drying with a soft towel, afterwards
dabbing with eau-de-cologne or good whisky.
BRIGHT’S DISEASE. —Denotes an inflammatory affec-
tion of the kidneys indicated by the presence of albumen
more or less excessively in the urine. The disease may
be very serious, and its treatment calls for the exercise
promptly of medical skill.
BRONCHITIS is an inflamed condition of the bronchial
membranes. Relief may be obtained in many cases
by the application of linseed or mustard poultices to
the chest and back, these being permitted to remain
on half an hour at a time and renewed as necessary,
the patient being kept warm in bed. Expectoration
may be rendered less painful by the administration of
ipecachuana or antimonial wine, squills or paregoric.
BUNIONS are painful swellings over the joints of the toes,
and particularly with regard to the great toes. They
are due to inflammation of the joint capsule. Hot
fomentation will afford relief, but the removal of the
cause is necessary to prevent recurrence.
CATARRH. —lncreased secretion of mucus from the
membranes of nose, ear, bronchia, stomach, alimentary
canal, or urinary passages. Catarrh of the air passages
may be remedied when not of serious extent, by
inhalation of eucalyptus or methol-impregnated steam.
CHICKEN POX. —A mild zymotic disease, common to
children, and usually occurring only once in a life-
time. Usually preceded by feverish conditions, the
eruption consists of white-headed pimples on the breast,
shoulders, face, scalp and body generally, affecting
also at times the tonsils and the palate. On the third
or fourth day the white vesicle dries up, leaving a scaly
crust w'hich soon falls away. If the pimples are not
irritated they leave no mark behind ; but if scratched
or rubbed by the patient they will sometimes ulcerate
and result in slight pitting. Carbolised oil applied to
the parts W'hich itch most painfully will allay the
irritation.
CHILBLAINS. —Persons rheumatically disposed and such
as are of a weak physique or “ below par ” in general
health are more liable to chilblains than others. Tincture
of iodine is sometimes applied successfully to affected
feet or hands, but the best lotion is that prepared from
carbolised zinc, one part carbolic acid to sixteen of
ointment.
CONVULSION. —When convulsions have occurred in
children, especially at the teething time, great care
should be taken to keep the bowels in regular activity,
and to maintain an equable bodily temperature by the
use of comfortable clothing.
CRAMP. —Friction is the best remedy for cramp, the
brisk rubbing of the affected part.
DANDRUFF. —A scurvy affection of the scalp, consisting
in exfoliation of the scales of the outer skin, of frequent
occurrence in infants and young children. It is
inadvisable to use hard brushes and small tooth combs
when dandruff is troublesome ; frequent washing with
borax solution is very beneficial.
DIABETES. —Abstention from the foods containing sugar
or starchy substances is usually enjoined, and the
medicines chiefly employed are opium, morphia, and
salicylate of soda. The disease is less fatal to people
well on in life than those of younger years.
DIARRHOEA. —Its proper treatment is the clearance of
the canal by means of castor oil and laudanum, or some
other effective aperient, such as a mixture of rhubarb,
ginger, and soda. In infantile diarrhoea chalk mixture
is usually administered after each loose purgation, but
the removal of the cause is of much more moment than
the stopping of the flow in most cases.


DIPHTHERIA is a dreadful disease, due generally to
insanitary conditions. Carbolic acid or some other
suitable germicide should be called into requisition and
frequent and persistent gargling performed, whilst
every endeavour must be made to improve the general
health by the employment of tonics and nutritious
and stimulative dietary.
DYSENTERY. —It is usually accompanied by fever, and
followed by useless straining for evacuation. The seat
of the mischief is mainly in the large intestine and the
mucous membrane, both of which become greatly
inflamed. It commences with shivering and feverish-
ness alternately and diarrhoea. Unless relief is obtain-
able, collapse usually occurs in a short period, and when
recovery has been effected there is always danger of
relapse upon dietary indiscretion or exposure to damp
and cold. Ipecacuanha is the great remedy for
dysentery in the East, and this and opiates after aperient
treatment with castor oil and laudanum often prove
useful in overcoming the disease.
ECZEMA. —A favourite remedial application externally
is the oxide of zinc, which may be dusted over an olive
oil dressing. The only soaps employed for cleansing
purposes in any kind of eczema should be those free
from all irritating detergent properties and properly
impregnated with either carbolic acid or juniper tar.
Dietary is of great importance in this disease. Salt
meats, acids, fruits, pastry, and soups should be
avoided, and malt and spirituous liquors.
FAINTING. —Loosen the clothing, sprinkle the face with
cold water, apply strong smelling salts to the nostrils.
Should the patient be capable of swallowing a little
sal volatile, or brandy and water, it may be administered.
Chafing the hands and friction to the limbs generally
is helpful, and it may be necessary to apply a mustard
poultice over the region of the heart.
GASTRITIS. —Chronic inflammation of the stomach,
frequently occasioned by continuous alcoholic indul-
gence, though it may arise from gout or other disease,
or be produced by strong purgative medicines or
indigestible food generally. Excessive thirst, restless-
ness, and local pain are symptomatic of gastritis, while
dilute hydrocyanic acid, administered in soda-water,
is remedial.
GOITRE is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is
commonest in districts situated on mountain limestone,
and is caused by drinking over-hard water. The cysts
or swelling sometimes reach large dimensions, and
occasion very considerable inconvenience, though they
are rarely accompanied by actual danger to life. The
accumulated fluid may be drawn away from the cyst
to afford local relief, and iodide of iron syrup often
proves beneficial.
LIGHTNING. —A person struck by lightning should have
cold water dashed over him immediately after experi-
encing the shock. Sal volatile or brandy may be
administered as a stimulant, and artificial respiration
employed if necessary, as in drowning or suffocation
cases. Keep away from trees or the sides of a tall
building in a thunderstorm ; the open is safer.
MUMPS.— Mumps are highly contagious, and frequently
epidemic amongst school children. Hot fomentations
will afford relief, and in severe cases the application of
leeches may be desirable.
NIGHTMARE can be directly traced to digestive derange-
ment in the shape of a heavy supper of wholesome
food, and in bad cases the horrible dreams it brings
may be aggravated into somnambulism. Let the
bowels be kept in order and the dietary be regulated
as to constituents and meal-times, and there will be
little nightmare.
SCURF. —A simple application for this ailment is an
admixture of the best vinegar with water in which a
lump of quick-lime has been dissolved over-night,
the liquid being strained from sediment. The roots
of the hair only need to be wetted, and the application
is quite harmless.
SORE THROAT.— It is at times a premonitory symptom
of some more or less serious ailment, as in scarlet fever,
quinsy, diphtheria, etc. A common accompaniment
of cold and catarrh, it is generally benefited by inhala-
tions of steam, medicated or otherwise, by the applica-
tion of linseed or bran poultices, by keeping in a warm
room for a day, followed by a mild • aperient in the
morning.
STY, a painful pimple upon one of the eyelids, proceeding
usually to suppuration and usually giving rise to
considerable disturbance as well as pain. Hot fomenta-
tion, great care being exercised not to injure the eye,
will usually afford rebef by bringing the suppuration
to a head.
An aperient may help matters, with tonic treatment to
follow. The eye should never be poulticed.
TONSILITIS or inflammation of the tonsils. The muriate
of calcium is a very valuable curative agent; but
indications of this ailment should always receive early
medical attention, as they frequently point to rheumatic
trouble.
TORPOR indicates injury to or disease of the nervous
system, and unless the semi-comatose person can be
roused by ordinary restoratives, a very grave condition
is plainly existent. Such torpidity calls at once for the
doctor’s assistance.
TRACHEA is that part of the windpipe between the
bronchial tubes and the larynx or organ of voice, liable
to inflammatory ailments, it is the portion of the air
passage surgically opened in the operation of tra-
cheotomy when suffocation threatens from diphtheria
and certain other malignant throat affections.
ULCER. —Ulcers call for antiseptic treatment, wherever
situate, to destroy the vitality of the malign agencies
at work within and connected with them. The sooner
and the more thoroughly this is undertaken the quicker
they will cease to trouble. They should be cleansed
and supported, preserved from irritating friction, and
dusted with iodoform or aristol to expedite their healing.
WHITLOW is a painful affection on the thumb or finger
deep down in the tissue due to blood-poisoning. There
will be great pain, heat and throbbing. Poulticing,
persistent and thorough, is requisite, to get the matter
away, and lancing will very likely be necessary to
clean out the wound completely. The general health
should at the same time have medical attention.
WHOOPING COUGH is an infectious ailment commencing
with what is usually called a “ common cold,” and
developing in a few days after the subsidence of febrile
symptoms, into a cough of spasmodic and often violently
paroxysmal description, with the characteristic
“ whooping ” inspiration at the close of each coughing
fit. The malady reaches its height in ten to twelve
days, when it gradually abates, but seldom leaves the
patient for some weeks, and is liable to recurrence.
REMEMBER, always send for a medical man, as soon
as possible, in all cases where professional assistance
is required.

MANY THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR STANDS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN SHEDS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA
AND NEW ZEALAND.


FIFTY YEARS OF PIONEERING and PROGRESS
Fifty years ago the original Moffat-Virtue Power-driven Shearing Machine was developed in
Sydney, and the first tests conducted at Tenterfleld Station, Tenterfield, New South Wales.
To-day thousands of sheds throughout Australia, New Zealand and America are equipped with
this well-known machine, and the fact that many of the earlier plants are still at work is
convincing proof of the sterling merit of the equipment.
We have had rather an unique experience, in that not only are we engineers who have designed
and built our own equipment, but as proprietors for many years of the largest contract shearing
company the world has ever seen, we were afforded a wonderful opportunity of making a very
close study of the actual shearing operation with every make of machine. Furthermore, we have
made it our business to make personal contact with the manufacturers both in Europe and
America who buy our Australian wool, and have obtained very helpful information from this
source —information which has enabled us to incorporate into our gear features of extreme
importance to the man who grows the wool.
Has it ever occurred to you as a grazier that with the exception of a few refinements, there were
no fundamental alterations in the design of the complete transmission gear to the handpiece of
any shearing machine in from 30 to 40 years until the advent of the latest model Moffat-Virtue
plant? In the interim the wool carrying capacity of the Australian merino sheep has almost
doubled, in addition to which a greater strain is also thrown on the mechanism, due to the
adoption of wider combs and cutters with increased frictional areas.
Is it any wonder therefore that we hear complaints of sheep being knocked about and bruised at
shearing time.
Does the average grazier know what actually happens between a handpiece and his sheep’s back?
Respectfully we suggest that the vast majority do not, otherwise they would not carry on with
their old gear which not only knocks the sheep about, but has a detrimental effect on the
subsequent growth of the wool.
After experiments extending over a period of three years, Moffat-Virtue evolved the Full
Floating Transmission which is exclusive to their machine. This ensures good clean shearing
without bruising due to mechanical drag, and gives you the effect of blade shearing without its
disadvantages. Engine power is reduced to practically half, and upkeep cost to handpieces
is reduced to an absolute minimum.
Now that the grazing industry is faced with the possibility of serious competition from the
artificial product, surely the time has arrived for those equipped with earlier model plants to
investigate a system which will not only reduce shearing costs, but ensure a better clip.
Any make of friction driven gear can be converted to the Moffat-Virtue Transmission at a
surprisingly low cost and we invite graziers to send for details of this wonderful proposition.
“Brookstead,”
Private Bag,
OAM ABU.
Dear Sirs,
This is to tell you I have finished the 1935 shearing with your Moffat-Virtue Machines, and have
been completely satisfied. I have found them all they were claimed to he. I killed two sheep each
day off the shears and did not find a bruised one amongst them as I did with the previous machines.
My ring shearer shore 200 sheep and still had %-hour to go before time was up—a tally which he
has never accomplished before. The sheep shorn were Merino and Half Breed.
Yours truly,
(Signed) R. R. C. THOMPSON.


THE No. 8 BALL BEARING HEAD GEAR
Your sound judgment will appre-
ciate the superior and exclusive
features of this head gear, which has
revolutionized machine shearing.
(1) Transmits a powerful steady drive to the down tube.
(2) No adjustments eliminates need for skilled attention.
(3) Dust-proof, grease-proof, double ball bearing assembly requires greasing yearly.
(4) Cone pulley assembly always in alignment with friction wheel, avoiding tendency
for leather cone to climb on the wheel, or bear heavily on the bearing.
(5) Self-Aligning ball bearings ensure free running of shafting even if shed becomes
distorted. Free running saves power, thus reducing fuel costs.
(6) Specially selected metals provide maximum strength and reduce weight.
(7) Cone pulley assembly can be removed in ten seconds while shafting is running.
(8) Minimum friction on working parts reduces running costs.

Dear Sir,
The new Ball Bearing Overhead Gears and No. 8 Extended Down Tubes proved to be excellent, and
the shearers were very pleased with the new Handpieces. Shearers who have been coming here for a number
of years shore more sheep on an average per day this year. There was also a very big saving in petrol.
Yours truly,

The
“TRIMMER”
Handpiece
An
Engineering Triumph
The cut-away section of the drawing
clearly illustrates the working principle of
the back joint. This is a special feature
not to be found in any other Handpiece.
It ensures strength and long life.
The Pivot Pins of the "Trimmer” Handpiece are
built on the same principle as lathe centres, a prin-
ciple that is adopted in all engineering lathes to-day.
Pins of a similar size and design as those incor-
porated in the Back Joint of the "Trimmer” would be
capable, if placed in a lathe, of carrying a crankshaft
weighing one ton and withstanding the milling action
of the tool.
AND HERE ARE THE REASONS WHY
(1) No more out of level troubles. The
"Trimmer” retains its level permanently.
(2) No centre post adjustment necessary
from new to worn cutters.
(3) Complete shear can be dismantled
including fork and main bush without
disturbing centre post adjustment.
(4) A back joint that will outlast any other
part of the shear.
(5) Adjustable back joint. Spindles and
cogs being kept in perfect alignment.
(6) All parts can be fitted to the back joint
without dismantling shear.
(7) The ONLY handpiece with a perfect
lubricating system to the back joint.
(8) Improved grip giving better control of
shear.
(9) A well-balanced and "Lively” hand-
piece ensuring easier shearing and
higher tallies.


Users Everywhere testify to the
superiority of the New “TRIMMER” Handpiece
LEONARD BROS.,
SHEARING CONTRACTORS,
YASS.
We wish to report that the “Trimmer”
Handpiece sent on trial to our Mr. Boh
Watkins has proved very satisfactory.
This machine was handed out on the
20th July and is still in use, having shorn
up to date just on 9,000 sheep. It has
been used in all back country sheds,
where the sand has caused much wear on
Handpieces, and we must say that it has
stood up to your expectation as being a
“Trimmer,” and you have named it cor-
rectly.
On examination, we find the machine
is still in perfect order and shows very
little wear, and in each shed the shearer
using it said that it is a sweet cutter; in
fact, one man has hung on to it for
three sheds.
You may use this letter just as you
like, and it is our intention when buying
new machines to put in “Trimmers.”
(Sgd.) THOS. P. LEONARD,
For Leonard Bros.
HUGHENDEN,
NORTH QUEENSLAND.
A line to let you know that I shore
over 9,000 sheep with your latest “Trim-
mer” Handpiece in the following sheds:
“Barenya,” “Sandalwood,” “Eldorada,”
“Mayfair,” and “Dalberry.” During the
whole time the Handpiece was never
once in the hands of the expert.
I must say that I think the “Trimmer”
is the finest Handpiece I have ever shorn
with, and I think all shed owners should
be interested in its performance. Further,
I have no hesitation in recommending it
to anyone requiring new Handpieces.
Wishing you every success with this
fine all-Australian shear, and you may
use this letter as you think fit.
(Sgd.) H. J. RAFTER (“Darkie”).
“Mount Eba” Station,
KINGOONYA, S.A.
The “Trimmer” Handpieces were a
great success and had really good tests
at “Miller’s Creek.” We shore 23,000
sheep with them, there were no replace-
ments and there appears to be very little
wear in the machines. The sheep were
very bad—full of sand, mud and kopi,
also very daggy, so you will see they
had a very good test.
Mr. Matheson brought them from
“Miller’s Creek" and we are using them
here. I put them out on the board just
as they came from the last place and so
far nothing has been done to them, so
from this you will see that they have
stood up to the job well and you should
sell a lot of them.
All the shearers reckon they are the
best Handpieces they have used, which is
something for a shearer to admit.
(Sgd.) H. S. T. WARNES, Overseer.
“CAROONBOON ” STATION,
WANGANELLA, N.S.W.
Re the 18 “Trimmer” Handpieces
which you sent to “Caroonboon.” I feel
I must write to let you know what I
think of them.
They are a wonderful machine and as
you say yourselves, they are “miles
ahead” of any other.
The sixteen shearers who used them on
the station said they were “the goods,”
and from an expert’s point of view they
are almost too good, as he will have very
little to do in regard to repairs, as there
is scarcely anything to go wrong, and the
material of which they are made seems to
be of the best.
In conclusion, I wish you all the suc-
cess you deserve with such a good
machine, as I think it has come to stay.

Dear Sirs,
Just a line to let you know how pleased I am with my 2 Stand
Shearing Plant after crutching about 12,000 sheep and shearing
about 1,000.
I have been shearing for forty years and contracting for some
years. I have shorn with every make of shearing machine and
head gear, driven by all kinds of engines, including electricity
and water-driven plants, and I am convinced that my Plant, from
end to end, is the best I have had anything to do with. There-
fore I would recommend the above to anybody requiring shearing
machinery with every confidence.
I might further mention that I crutched 1,000 wethers that
were in a very daggy condition and covered with mud through
flood waters.
We only used one Comb a run and about three Cutters, which
were M-V Combs and Cutters. The same shearers, prior to getting
this Plant, were crutching in a similar class of sheep and were
using four Combs and nine or ten Cutters.
Yours faithfully,

ELECTRIC SHEARING GEAR
IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE INSTALLATION
OF ELECTRIC SHEARING GEAR, YOU OWE IT TO
YOURSELF TO SEE THIS PLANT.
The M-V Ball-Bearing Electric Head Gear is fitted with a
horizontal motor, friction driven, which provides the essen-
tial flexibility between the leather cone and the friction wheel
to cater for sudden jars due to the handpiece striking burrs
or other obstructions in the wool.
The motor is a d h.p. ball-bearing unit of the split phase
type, 230-250 volts A.C. or D.C., or three phase up to 550
volts A.C. at 40 or 50 cycles. It is started by the snap of a
switch, and continues to revolve at its rated speed throughout
the run. To engage the handpiece, you merely pull a cord,
which actuates an extremely simple and effective ratchet,
and the load is smoothly taken up by the motor, which has
already attained its full speed.
As no oil is used in any of the driving mechanism of the
head gear, there is no loss in transmission due to greasy
cones, and a constant, even flow of power is transmitted to
the down tube and the handpiece. The friction drive
embraces our standard cone pulley assembly and Standard
No. 8 down tubes.
Realising that the average
country man has little know-
ledge of electricity, we have
concentrated on eliminating
the risks and troubles asso-
ciated with earlier electric
plants. There is no risk from
over-lubrication burning out
the armature, as the motor
requires no additional lubrica-
tion for many years and, what
is of even greater importance,
the plant is shock-proof.
With the extension of electricity into
country areas, the electric machine has
claimed our attention. We approached
this problem with years of experience
in the electrical field at the back of us,
and our objective has been to produce
a sturdy, simple machine, economical
in its running cost, and yet with a
generous margin of surplus power
available.

“M-V” FAMOUS “TRIMMER” COMBS
Made in Australia to Suit Australian Conditions
In designing the "Trimmer” Comb, M-V had two definite objectives in mind:—
(1) To produce a Comb that would enter the heaviest fleece and travel with the least effort
to the shearer. Retain a keen cutting edge under all conditions, give longer life, and
reduce breakages to a minimum.
(2) To make a Comb that would not harm or injure the sheep.
How successful we have been is borne out by the
ever increasing acceptance of our Combs and Cutters
by experienced shearers.
When the Graziers’ Association recently conducted
a searching inquiry into the Comb position with a view
to improving the quality of shearing and making it
more humane, thus reducing sheep losses, they drew
up a standard specification with which Comb Manu-
facturers were expected to comply, and it was found
that the "TRIMMER” COMBS ALREADY CON-
FORMED TO THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS.
BENT TOOTH.
The “Trimmer” Comb has
been proved the Ideal Comb
for both the Grazier and
the Shearer.
STRAIGHT TOOTH.
The uniform bevels and specially treated
points prevent them from picking up the skin and
scratching the sheep.
"Trimmer” Combs are finished ready for
use.
With improved tempering methods, they
retain their cutting edge longer than any other

“M-V” BALL BEARING SHEEP SHEARING
MACHINERY
For erection in one line, and approximately 5 ft. between each Stand.


“M-V” CONVERSION GEAR
For those who desire to obtain the advantages of the M-V full-floating transmission,
the value of which has been set out in previous pages, we have designed a series of Ball-Bear-
ing Conversion Brackets, covering all makes of friction-driven Gear.
Our many years of experience in the contract shearing field with all makes of machines,
together with our engineering manufacturing knowledge, has enabled us to design a Conversion
Bracket which can be adapted to an existing Overhead Gear, which will give the utmost
efficiency at a surprisingly small cost.
Conversions are also available to permit of the use of existing "Wolseley” and "Lister”
Down Tubes.
In all cases the Ball-Bearing Cone Pulley Assembly is similar, and interchangeable with,
our famous Standard No. 8 Assembly. The weight of the Tube is not carried on the Cone
Pulley Spindle, with the result that a steadier drive is transmitted to the Handpiece.
All Conversions can be fitted in ,a few minutes without alteration to your existing Brackets
or Shafting.
M-V No. 7 BALL-BEARING CONVERSION
BRACKET.
Fitted with Standard Ball Bearing Cone Pulley
Assembly and Tumbling Tommy Control.
Can be attached to any No. 7 Plant in a few
minutes, no expert knowledge being required.
Existing Down Tubes can be used, or alternatively,
by reversing the direction of rotation, M-V No. 8
full floating Down Tube can be supplied.
E—Note the Special Oil Cup, which prevents
surplus oil from reading the Leather Cone
Pulley. The oil is car ; ,d down to the interior
of the Down Tube.
M-V No. 4 BALL-BEARING CONVERSION
BRACKET.
Fitted with Standard Ball-Bearing Cone Pulley
Assembly, with Tumbling Tommy Control. Can be
fitted to any Plant of this design. The existing Down
Tube cannot be used for this model, and new No.
8 Down Tubes will be required, in which case it is
necessary to reverse the direction of rotation.
NO EXPERT KNOWLEDGE
IS REQUIRED TO INSTALL.

“Rockgidgiel,” Quirindi, N.S.W.
I must say I am very pleased with the
ball-bearing gear, and the shearers are loud
in its praise.
(Sgd.) A. J. CAMPBELL.
“Boorandarra,” Cobar, N.S.W.
Now as regards the 6 Stand Plant, well
I can’t speak too highly, as it seems to be
the last thing in perfection, and the shearers
all said the same.
(Sgd.) E. H. CHAPMAN.
The illustration above shows the accessibility
of the M-V Ball-Bearing Cone Pulley Assembly,
which can be removed, while all other gear is
in operation, in ten seconds, without removing
the Down Tube.
Just think what this advantage means, and
REMEMBER, it is EXCLUSIVE to Moffat-
Virtue Gear.
Longreach, Q.
We have nothing but praise for the 6
Stands purchased three years ago. Although
it has been shifted time and again, from
station to station, we have not had to
replace any single part.
(Sgd.) SINCLAIR & KERB.
“Eural,” Garah, N.S.W.
I have found the Plant just as good as
you claim, in fact better, and the saving in
petrol and oil is worthy of mention.

THE “M-V” SHEEP JETTING PLANTS
M-V SENIOR JJETTER.
Capacity, 1 to 10 Jets. Weight, 600lbs. nett. Length, 5ft. 8ins. Width, 2ft.
1lins. Height, 3ft. lin.
Standard Equipment: 2-30 ft. M-V Pressure Hoses, 2 Standard M-V Guns with
single Nozzles. Self Filler Pump extra.
The ravages of the blowfly arc
estimated by experts to cost Aus-
tralia £3,000,000 per annum, and
doubtless you have been contribut-
ing something to this enormous
loss of revenue.
Moffat-Virtue’s effort towards
keeping this money in graziers’
pockets includes a most compre-
hensive range of proved fly strike
preventatives comprising M-V Jet-
ters, M-V Crutchers, and M-V Pest
Arrestors.
After 10 years of scientific investi-
gation by the New South Wales
Department of Agriculture they
have proved a combination of jet-
ting and then crutching at periods
to be an outstandingly efficient
method of protection, and in con-
sultation with their entomologists
we have designed our NEW JET-
TERS to efficiently treat from the
largest down to the smallest flocks.
“M-V” Senior and Utility Models
closely resemble one another, being each complete plants of the horizontal type mounted on wooden skids.
They have proved to hundreds of owners a sound insurance against both fly and fire.
The Heart of every Jetter is its Pump and the development of the M-V Patented Pressure Pump occupied
several years before it met the exacting demands of sheep jetting. Now they have become famous—
1. They are GLANDLESS—because suspended solids ruin glands, cause jamming and frequent breakages.
2. They are COMPENSATING —to give more even pressure.
3. They are EQUALISING —to need but half the power and fuel.
4. They are ENCLOSED—to exclude sheep yard dust.
5. They RUN IN OlL—for perfect unattended lubrication.
6. They HAVE CRANK SLIDE BLOCKS—because of larger working areas, thus reducing wear.
7. Their DESIGN affords maximum accessibility and is FULLY PROTECTED by Patent No. 112313.
These Pumps are operated by the sturdy M-V 2\ H.P. Petrol Engine (see page 65) and maintain an
exceptionally steady and even pressure without attention hour after hour, so that the operator can concentrate
on jetting. Our Senior Jetter is a very powerful plant with abundant capacity for the heaviest work
whether Jetting, Fire-fighting, Spraying or Flame-throwing on grasshopper beds.


Both SENIOR and UTILITY
MODELS are equipped with
bronze pressure regulators which
can be adjusted while running and
locked to give any desired penetra-
tion of wool from the jets.. The
mechanical oscillating agitators are
also identical and employ a com-
bination of cascade and swirl
movements to ensure even suspen-
sion of all solids in the jetting
fluid. The agitating movement is
taken direct from the enclosed oil
bath gear box and enters the vat
from the top, hence all glands,
chain drives, pitman arms, etc., are
dispensed with.
The M-V SENIOR AND UTIL-
ITY JETTERS are equipped with
heavy welded and then galvanised
44 gall, horizontal vat having a
deep 10 x lOin. filler hopper with
large brass gauze strainer and cast
lid to exclude dust. The outstand-

reliability and simplicity in operation have been praised by hundreds of users throughout Australia.
OTHER USES are spraying sheep yards, killing grasshoppers, disinfecting woolsheds, white-washing, and,
when required, the 2J H.P. Engine can readily be dismounted for general purposes on the property.
AS BUSH FIRE FIGHTERS these models have proved themselves a very sound investment and for a few
shillings extra the SENIOR can be fitted with two I" bore fire nozzles giving a 40ft. throw. The UTILITY
takes one I" nozzle, and both take i" Centrifugal Filler Pump as an extra to refill the vat including 10ft.
of delivery and 10ft. of suction hose, foot valve and strainer.
“M-V” Standard Gun
The design of our STANDARD GUN is the evolution
of years of practical experience. The grip and trigger
are shaped to the hand and balance is excellent. Both
stainless steel valve stem and gun metal valve are readily
accessible. Take I in. M-V Special Jetting Hose. Capacity
1 to 5 jets.
Here is Proof of their Efficiency
Corinda Station, ARAM AC, Q’LD.
Dear Sirs,
The Moffat-Virtue Jetter is a Godsend. We put it up on the truck and, using 200 lbs. pressure,
myself and two men, one driving the truck, put out a mile and a half of burning waist high grass
at midday last week with 40 gallons of water. Along the tracks 40 gallons do about two miles.
Yours faithfully, (Signed) C. F. RICH.

“M-V” Junior Jetter
fills the need of the smaller flock owner, outstationer
or mixed farmer, and enables him to jet when and
where necessary to best prevent fly strike. Equipped
with the same M-V "Pony” Engine and agitator as
our RUNABOUT and mounted on a sturdy steel
frame, the M-V JUNIOR JETTING PUMP is a
masterpiece in simplicity, efficiency and accessibility.
Loosen one nut, and you can remove both glass ball
valves and their rubber seats with the fingers. The
JUNIOR is fitted with an extra large air chamber
and maintains even pressure automatically controlled
as described under Runabout. Transportable with
detached pendulum agitator in the boot or rear of a
car.
The “M-V” Runabout Jetter
is mounted on a stretcher type frame and can be
clamped in 10 seconds to an ordinary oil drum stood
end up. It transports on the back seat of a car and
combats those sudden fly strikes right in the paddocks.
Necessary oil drums can be left at suitable positions on
the run ready to attach the Jetter, and long droving
and much time is saved.
THE RUNABOUT is fitted with the M-V Patent Pres-
sure Pump identical with that on the UTILITY and
is vee belt driven by a Moffat-Virtue "Pony” Air-
cooled Engine mounted on the pump. Perfect agita-
tion is provided by a detachable pendulum paddle
traversing the bottom of the drum each pump stroke
and operated direct from the pump rod. The pressure
is automatically controlled to any desired poundage in
this and our Junior Model by a simple weighted lever
accurately calibrated and working a by-pass valve to
permit surplus fluid to return to the drum. This lever
control facilitates starting of the "Pony” engine since
any remaining pres-
sure can be
released to free the
engine of load.

A Hand Jetter
at last, after years of research, that is not a back breaker yet not
a toy. You only pump what goes on the sheep, yet by a simple
device continuous mechanical agitation is available—quite an
achievement. Uses the same Pump as the JUNIOR with shorter
stroke; long lever handle reduces effort, and large air chamber
permits two or three shots from the gun without appreciable loss
of pressure, making it very easy for the pump operator to pump
to his gauge readings. The design ensures that only the last pumped
and agitated fluid goes to the gun, while the remainder in the large
capacity bottle acts as a reserve for even pressure.
“M-V” Junior Gun
(This gun is not suitable for over 8 jet nozzles.)
“M-V” Nozzles
Much development has taken place in various types of Nozzles in recent years to acquire better results and
faster jetting. Three types of M-V Nozzles are available for Jetting and three for other purposes.
1. M-V Single Jet Nozzle (standard equip-
ment) for Jetting, Fire Fighting, Car Wash-
ing, etc.
2. M-V Patented Non-track 3-Jet Nozzle for
Jetting and Fire Fighting, has proved most
popular. The jets cannot track one another
and a readily cleaned strainer prevents
clogging.
3. M-V Uniflow 5-Jet Nozzle suitable for
Senior and Utility Models only, for speedy
efficient Jetting.
4. M-V Fire Fighting J" bore Nozzle designed
to Brigade Formula for heavy quenching.
(For Senior and Utility Models only.)
5. M-V Angle Spray Nozzle for spraying dis-
infectants, whitewashing, sheep yard spray-
ing and ideal for fire break burning.
6. M-V Flame Thrower Attachment and special
Hose for destroying noxious weeds, grass-
hopper beds, burning off, etc. —a most useful
tool.
Calarsenite
The proved success of present day sheep jetting is mostly due to much improved plant in combination with
new and much more effective jetting materials.
"Calarsenite” the outstanding destroyer of the sheep fly larvae is made by a leading Australian firm of
Manufacturing Chemists to a formula based on recommendations of entomologists of the N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture. Being ready-mixed in exactly proper proportions of the best quality ingredients, "Calarsenite’
has superseded the messy hit-or-miss, home-made mixtures of the past. There is no tedious weighing, heating
or boiling and —it costs no morel

and Agitator.
A typical M-V Fire-fightiny Unit.
FEATURES OF “M-V” FIRE-FIGHTING UNIT
The double-acting piston pump is of totally enclosed self-oiling design, and is driven
by V belts direct from the engine shaft. It is fitted with a pressure chamber and pressure
gauge, and delivers the water to two high-pressure hoses. Pressures are adjustable, and the
pump has sufficient capacity to maintain a constant flow of water at a pressure of 130 lbs. The
nozzles on the high pressure hose are controlled by hand-lever-operated valves which instantly
open or close to regulate the flow of water, and an automatic by-pass valve is incorporated to
enable the water pumped through the piston pump to pass back to the tank if the nozzles are
not in constant use while the piston pump is working.
The centrifugal pump mounted snugly
on the opposite side of the engine to the
piston pump is driven by a small flat
drive fitted with a jockey to act as a
clutch. The belt is always in position,
and it is only necessary to raise the jockey
to enable filling of the tank to commence.
The pump has a capacity of 50-60 gallons
per minute and will fill the tank in 5 to
6 minutes. It is kept permanently primed
from the by-pass fitted on the delivery
from the piston pump.

Dear Sirs,
Regarding the Pest Arrestor 1 purchased from you some time ago, I have no hesitation in
saying that it is the most useful little implement that sheep men have ever had offered to them,
and any sheep owner that has not one already in use I would strongly recommend to procure one
without delay.
Their many uses are too numerous to mention; as a hand jetter for treating fly trouble it is
on its own. It is also a very handy drenching gun, and a most useful thing on the shearing hoard
for treating cuts.
Yours faithfully,

“M-V” INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES
INTRODUCTION
The Internal Combustion Engine has made a worthy contri-
bution toward the success of Primary Production in Australia.
Since the beginning of the Twentieth Century, Internal Com-
bustion Engines have developed with a rapidity unequalled in
any other branch of Engineering, and by their more intensive
use, have made it possible to serve better a greater number of
people.
MOFFAT-VIRTUE are proud to have played a part in the development and production of
these types of Engines particularly suited for the use of the Primary Producer.
Right from the commencement when it was decided to enter into the manufacturing field it was
recognised that we must thoroughly understand the purpose for which our engines were required,
and the conditions under which they would be expected to efficiently perform their work.

WORKING PRINCIPLE.
All M*V True Diesel Engines operate on the four cycle principle, air being
taken in on suction stroke through an air filter and mechanically operated
inlet valve. The heat generated during the compression stroke ignites the
fuel oil which is injected by fuel pump through the self-cleaning Pintle nozzle.
The patented combustion chamber is designed to provide maximum turbu-
lence. Nearing the end of the power stroke, and during the exhaust stroke
the exhaust gases escape through the exhaust valve and silencer.

“M-V” VERTICAL DIESEL ENGINES
IMPORTANT FEATURES
Cylinder Head
Has many unique features which go a
long way to make an outstanding Engine.
The Internal Combustion Chamber
design provides for the greatest possible
air turbulence. This ensures easy start-
ing, good combustion, low running cost,
absence of carbon deposits and a mini-
mum of Cylinder-Piston wear. High air
turbulence explains why the Exhaust on an M-V Engine is always
clear, and also why you can run one of these Engines for thousands
of hours without any carbon gathering in the Internal Combustion
Chamber or Exhaust Valve Port. Head Design provides for Valves
being placed horizontally, thus being removable without breaking
Head Joint. Illustration shows Air Valve Case with Valve removed
("A”), also Exhaust Valve ("B”) with replaceable Seating ("C”)
on right hand side of Head.
Cylinder Liner
The Cylinder Liner is made from special chrome nickel alloy iron;
a particularly hard and close-grained metal ensuring remarkably long
life under even the most gruelling conditions. The Liner is so
designed that it can be easily withdrawn and replaced by any user
without previous Engine experience. Although this special alloy
Liner has extremely long life, it can be replaced for a modest outlay.
Piston
Piston is made from chrome nickel alloy iron and after heat-treating,
is ground true to one half-thousandth of an inch. It is fitted with
three Compression Rings and two Oil Rings. Gudgeon Pin is made
from 3 per cent, nickel steel, case-hardened and is of the floating
type. Connecting Rod is drop forged from special steel, heavy "H-
-section”, providing great strength. Big-End Bearing is of gun-metal,
lined with a special grade of copper-hardened anti-friction metal.
Crankshaft
The Crankshaft is made from the highest grade steel. Design pro-
vides for balance weights being attached to webs, which ensure perfect
balance and a sweet running engine. Bearings are made from
graphitic bronze, which has phenomenal wear-resisting qualities and
the added advantage that if the engine is run completely dry of
c-il, bearings will not damage the Crankshaft.


“M-V” DIESEL ENGINES
IMPORTANT FEATURES
Fuel Filter
J The Fuel Filter is very simple in desiga, and very easily dismantled for cleaning purposes. The fabric centre
* efficiently filters all fuel entering the Atomiser, and therefore assists in securing trouble-free service.
Camshaft Gears and Governor.
Camshaft
The Camshaft is made from special steel.
Cams are integral with the shaft and are
finished in a profiling machine, ensuring
standardised timing with the highest
engine efficiency. Camshaft and Cams
are case-hardened, ensuring lifelong wear
without replacement. Camshaft is carried
in phosphor-bronze Bearings.
Accessibility
Although these Engines are totally enclosed, all parts are
readily accessible. Removal of a simple plate opens up
port to the Big-end Bearings. Removal of a plate on the
side of the Engine exposes Camshaft and Governor.
Plates on top of the Head can be easily taken off for
inspection of Valve Levers. Thus all parts of the Engine
are quickly accessible. Also keep in mind that the Valves
can be ground in without removing the Head or breaking
the Head joint—another factor in accessibility. Still
another feature is a plate on the side of the Head which
opens up the Waterways far easy cleaning.
Governor
Note the unusual size of the Camshaft Driving Gears —
Pinion is in steel and Wheel in phospor bronze. These
Gears are of the helical type ensuring silent running and
extra strength. The Governor, you will note, is carried in
the Camshaft Gear Wheel, and is of the simple ball type.
This Governor actuates the mechanism in the "C.A.V.”
Pump which regulates the fuel and maintains wonderfully
steady running under all conditions. Illustration at left
shows sideplate removed, exposing Camshaft Driving
Gears and Governor.
Camshaft.
Heat Treated Castings
An advanced feature in the manufacture of "M-V” Diesel Engines.
All castings are placed in a gas furnace where they are subjected to special heat treatment for twelve hours.
This eliminates all internal stresses and strains set up in the castings when first produced. It means that
after machining, no distortions can take place, such as happens with non-heated castings. Distortions mean
undue pressure on wearing parts with shorter life and lower efficiency.


“M-V” DIESEL ENGINES
IMPORTANT FEATURES
Fig. 1.
Cyclonic Turbulence
Combustion Head.
To ensure proper combustion of diesel fuel, great air turbulence
in the Combustion Chamber is necessary. The design adopted in
the Moffat-Virtue Engine Head ensures the highest efficient degree
of turbulence. (Figure 1 shows section diagram of this Head).
It will be seen that the Piston has a knob "A” which enters the
neck of the Combustion Chamber on the compression stroke.
When this happens a very confined circular space is left between
the knob and the neck, through which air has to pass into the
Combustion Chamber. The high velocity attained by the air at
this point, combined with the off-set circular design of the
Chamber, results in a terrific swirling and rotating of the air at
the moment of highest compression when the fuel is pumped in,
thus securing a complete mixing of the fuel and air.
Good combustion means economy in fuel, easy starting and absence
of carbon, resulting in long life to the Engine parts, particularly
the Piston Rings, Cylinder, Valves and Valve Seatings.
High air turbulence in this Combustion Chamber not only secures
these results, but enables a self-cleaning pintle type Atomiser and
Spray Nozzle to be used.
The pintle type Nozzle has one central hole through
which the point of the Needle Valve projects when the
Valve is seated and no fuel is being ejected. When the
Plunger of the Fuel Pump is driven up by the Cam, a
high fuel pressure is created in a small annular chamber
around the front of the Needle Valve. This lifts the
Valve off the Seat and causes the projecting point of
the Needle to move inwardly, opening up a circular
aperture between the Needle Valve and Spray Hole.
Through this aperture a fine circular spray of fuel is
ejected at high pressure into the Combustion Chamber.
Fig. 2 shows end of Atomiser or Nozzle with Needle
Valve in stationary position. Fig. 3 shows Atomiser
and Needle Valve in ejecting position. It will thus
be seen that the Needle Valve has a reciprocating
motion, and that the projecting pintle point passing in
and out of the hole has a self-cleaning action. The
pintle type Nozzle is simple, demands a minimum of
attention and is fool-proof.
Fig. 3
Fig. 2.
Self-Cleaning Pintle Type Nozzle.
The Features described are well worthy of careful study
before selecting a Diesel Engine, as they ensure years
of trouble-free and faithful service.

INTRODUCTION
Electricity in the Country
Home at Less than City
Cost!
Have you ever envied your city friends the Electrical comforts available to them by the
pressing of a switch? Brilliant light, drudgery saving appliances such as Electric Vacuum
Cleaner, Washing Machine, Kitchen Mixer, Fans, Electric Iron, etc.
Such conveniences are now available to the country home at LESS COST THAN TO THE
CITY DWELLER. You can light a large room for 15 hours at a cost of ONE PENNY.
Many country people are under the impression that Electric Light is an expensive luxury;
basing their calculations on conditions ruling some years ago, when many 32 Volt sets were
installed to provide not only ordinary light and power, but to run an Electric Refrigerator as
well. Such plants were grossly overloaded, with the result that during hot summer months the
engine was running for lengthy periods each week, causing rapid depreciation of the batteries.
With the introduction of the Electrolux Kerosene Refrigerator, the country man can now enjoy
the comforts and conveniences of an electric lighting plant to cater for the balance of his
requirements at a much reduced initial outlay and lower running cost. We specialize in
Country House Electric Lighting and Power problems, and our experience over many years,
covering supply of plants from the smallest domestic units to the installation of Town lighting
up to 500 horsepower, is at your disposal.
Let Electricity be a willing servant and solve your many domestic problems.
The low cost of installing a Moffat-Virtue plant will surprise you. A perusal of the following

Exide HOME LIGHTING BATTERIES
MOFFAT-VIRTUE consolidated the quality and dependability of the M-V HOME LIGHTING PLANTS
on becoming associated with Exide Batteries of Australia Pty. Ltd. as New South Wales Distributors of the
World Renowned EXIDE Home Lighting Batteries.
Exide has an unequalled experience in the application of Storage Batteries—many of them were pioneered
by Exide—having been established since 1891, concentrating on the manufacture of Storage Batteries in the
largest and best equipped Storage Battery factory in the British Empire.
Fifty years may be a "snap of the fingers” in the life of this planet, but it is a long stretch in the history
of Electrical Storage Battery manufacture.
Exide commenced operations as far back as 1889 near Manchester, England. To-day they produce such
world famous types as Exide Chloride Batteries for storage of electricity, Exide Iron Clad Batteries for marine
work and innumerable types and sizes for all sorts of applications.
Everywhere where there is need for a battery you will find Exide Batteries giving unfailing service. In every
nook and corner of the Globe, across the Sandy Desert, round the Polar Regions, where daring scientists are
trying to solve the hidden mysteries, Exide Batteries are furnishing infallible service. Exide Batteries have
been the companion of such intrepid men as Capt. Byrd, South Pole Explorer; Amundsen, Arctic Explorer;
U.S.A. Army Round-the-World Flyers; the late Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, Trans-Pacific Flyer and record
dash England to Australia; Sir Douglas Mawson, Antarctic Expedition; Sir Hubert Wilkins, Submarine
Expedition to North Pole, to mention only a few who have placed their confidence in Exide, knowing that
where extremes of temperature and hard service far beyond civilisation’s last outpost are encountered, these
batteries would render faithful and distinguished service.
Nine out of ten ships flying the British flag are Exide equipped, including such maritime monsters as the
"Queen Elizabeth” and "Queen Mary”.
Exide manufacture single cells of two volts weighing 6000 lb. with as many as 150 cells to a battery, making
a total weight of just over 400 tons, down to "featherweight” cells for the use of Aircraft. Truly amazing
evidence of the versatility and capacity of Exide’s Engineers and organisation, the like of which cannot be
found anywhere in the battery world today.

Exide CHLORIDE PLANTE
TYPE BATTERIES
Points worth noting in Types
DSG and DBG
1. DISTINCTIVE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
LUGS, ensuring correct connecting up. Design requires
only one connecting bolt per cell, thereby minimising
risk of heating.
2. SPECIAL VENT PLUG to avoid spilling of acid
from fully charged cell during transport.
3. FULLY SEALED LID, minimising evaporation and
acid spray, and enabling cells to be transported in
fully charged condition.
4. ACID LEVEL LINE clearly moulded on glass box,
enabling electrolyte to be easily maintained at correct
level and uniform specific gravity.
5. SEPARATOR HOLD-DOWNS, preventing move-
ment of separators.
6. MOULDED GLASS CONTAINERS, with isolating
ribs between each pair of plate lugs.
7. TREATED WOOD SEPARATORS, forming a com-
plete diaphragm entirely preventing internal short
circuits and which can be inserted or withdrawn with-
out disturbing groups in any way.
5. COLOURED BAND HYDROMETER (in pilot cell),
indicating state of charge or discharge at all times.
9. THICK PLANTE POSITIVE PLATES, ,47in. thick
(almost half an inch).
10. BOX TYPE NEGATIVE PLATES, for advantages
see page 85.
11. SPRING BUFFERS, giving a resilient support to the
plates.
12. FEET MOULDED ON GLASS CONTAINER,
eliminating separate insulators.
*The length of the cell is measured at right angles to plate. Particulars of open type Cells or larger Capacity Cells on application.


Exide CHLORIDE PLANTE
TYPE BATTERIES
The Positive Plate
A positive Exide Chloride Plante-type plate, as illustrated on the
right, is of pure metallic lead, with a surface of active material, con-
sisting of lead peroxide formed by an electrolytic process. This
active material is continuously renewed by the charging current that
the battery receives in service. The lugs, frame and reinforcing ribs
are designed with great care, and the result is a plate of great strength
and efficiency.
The Negative Plate
The box-type Negative plate shown in the illustration at the bottom
of the page consists of a hard lead alloy frame cast in two halves,
each having an outer face of finely-perforated sheet lead. The active
material is inserted into the boxes or cages formed by placing the
two halves of the grid against each other, after which they are rivetted
together. The chief advantage of this method of construction is
that the capacity of the plate can be maintained practically constant
over a long period of years. Exide Box-type Negative plates usually
outlast two positive plates. The illustration shows one of the halves
opened up and bent back. Although an Exide Chloride Plante-type
House-Lighting Battery costs a little more than the pasted type, it
more than repays by giving better and considerably longer service.
Prices on application.
A Battery of 14 "DBG-4”
Cells on Double-tier Stand.
The development of the electric storage
battery has been the subject of constant
investigation and improvement for the
past fifty years, and the Plante type of cell
which Exide has placed on the market
represents the fruit of experience of the
highest talent available in this special
field of applied electricity.
The Exide Chloride Plante type cell is
unquestionably the best type made for
home-lighting purposes. Exide Chloride
Plante type cells of the same capacity as
the pasted type, and working under the
same conditions will, at a very modest
estimate, give two to three times the
service.

Exide “HYRAY”
HOUSE-LIGHTING BATTERIES
Exide "Hyray” house-lighting cells are manufactured in two
types, the Exide Hyray and the Exide Hyray De Luxe. The
elements are of the pasted plate design suspended from sturdy
glass lids, and are assembled in glass jars. The dimensions
of the plates are: —Positive, s|in. wide, B|in. high, and 5/32in.
thick; Negative, s|in. wide, B|in. high and Jin. thick.
The difference between the Hyray and the Hyray De Luxe is
that the separator in the former is grooved on one side, whereas
the separator in the Hyray De Luxe is of an improved type,
being approximately twice the thickness and grooved on both
sides.
Exide house-lighting plates are assembled in glass jars, which
have distinct advantages over hard rubber, viz.: The condition
of the plates and the level of the electrolyte is always visible.
This visibility makes it easier to maintain the electrolyte at
its proper level.
“KXE-4” Batteries
The Exide KXE-4 House-Lighting Batteries were designed to
meet the demand for something exceptionally robust for use
in small house-lighting sets.
Genuine hard rubber containers are used, and the elements are
assembled in 2-volt units.
The cell dimensions are: Width, 7iin.; length, 4 11-I6in.;
height, 9|in.

Exide KXE-8
HOME LIGHTING BATTERY
The Outstanding Ebonite Cased Home Lighting Battery-
Unequalled in Performance and Value
To meet the demand for a low-priced but entirely satisfactory house-lighting unit, Exide have designed and
manufactured the KXH-8 House-Lighting Battery. Although this battery costs but a few pounds more than
"make-shift” house-lighting batteries offered by other manufacturers, it will give at least twice the service. Its
advantages over such converted car batteries are;—
THE PLATES are made specifically for house-lighting purposes, and are designed to give slow discharge over
long periods, instead of quick discharge over short periods. Both the positive and negative plates are much
thicker than the thin car battery types.
INSULATION: Additional insulation has been given to the plates by making the containers wider, permitting
the use of wider separators.
SEPARATORS: Are also considerably thicker. This additional thickness is taken up by deeper grooves
allowing a greater volume of acid around the element.
CONTAINERS: The hard rubber containers have been made 1 inch taller, which increases the sediment
space at the bottom by that amount.
ASSEMBLY: Assemblage of the cells in 4-volt units gives a more compact installation and reduces the bolted
connections of the battery by 50%. The length of the container is 14|in.; width, 7 3-16 in.; overall height,
10|in.; weight of 4-volt unit, complete with acid, 791 b.; without acid, 661 b.; normal charging rate, 16 amperes;
initial charging rate, 12 amperes; S.A.E. rating, 213 amperes hours.

MOFFAT-VIRTUE “SIMPLEX” WINDMILL
Standardised —Precision Built
There's Profit
in the Wind
The POWER in the wind is FREE. Every
day millions of horse power flows, unused,
across our land. Harnessed to a modern
wind motor a portion of this energy is con-
verted into terms of FREE WATER. The
Man on the Land can do without many things,
but water —in quantities ample for his needs
—he must have. Upon its cost hinges largely
the extent of his margin of profit. Every
penny saved in pumping costs is CLEAR
PROFIT.
Many pennies—and many pounds —are saved
yearly by a good windmill. Apart from its
COST-FREE OPERATION, the windmill
releases its owner and his employees for the direct work of production. Day and night
it works unaided, unattended, and often far from the homestead, pouring out a wealth
of water for stock and crops.
But —and there is a "but” —the mill to which the landholder entrusts his water supplies
MUST be the very best available. It must be:
STRONG, to resist storms. POWERFUL, to pump most water. EASY RUNNING,
to make the most of light winds. REALLY SELF-OILING, to need little attention.
BALL-BEARING, for long, trouble-free life. SILENT, to avoid offence to the owner.
SIMPLE TO SERVICE by unskilled labour.
All these qualities are found in the MOFFAT-VIRTUE "SIMPLEX,” which represents
the BEST ENGINEERING PRACTICE intelligently applied to the needs of the Man
on the Land. It is with pleasure and complete confidence that we offer this fine mill
to our clients.


Moffat-Virtue “Simplex” Geared Windmill
Self-Oiling — Totally Enclosed — Ball Bearing
Every working part runs in oil. Windwheel shaft of large diameter with ball bearings.
Turntable of large diameter with ball bearings top and bottom. Twin pinions and
gear wheels. Strongly built windwheel. Strong 4-post steel tower. MADE IN SIZES:
Bft., 10ft., 12ft. and 14ft.


Moffat-Virtue “Simplex” Geared Windmill
The Assembled Motor
With cover turned back, showing
gears, connecting rods, and cross-
head. The castings —including
cover —are all semi-steel of clean
design and good finish. The gear
box is accurately machined for the
ball bearings on the windwheel
shaft and the stub axles on which
the twin gear wheels revolve. The
stub axle bearings are adjustable for
depth of mesh of the gear teeth,
thus ensuring silent operation for
life.
SECTIONAL VIEW OF MOTOR: Notice that the bore at each end of the Spider (9) is
tapered—at the motor end to fit the tapered part of the shaft; at the outer end to receive the
conical nut which is split longitudinally through one side and
thus expands and grips the casting at the outer end while forcing I I
it on to the shaft taper at the motor end. il IL
The Twin Gear Wheels
(7) run in oil, and in
revolving carry an &
ample and ! positive
supply to the pinions ip||pig—g
from one of which the
oil is removed by a lip || ]
and runs down a chute P 9
in the oil-collecting ring
(16) to the front bearing housing (15).
Provision is made for the excess oil to over-
flow back into the gear box.
The Twin Pinions
(8) are moulded by special machine and cast in one piece, thus ensuring correct and
permanent alignment of the teeth without the use of keys, pins, or other devices.


Moffat-Virtue “Simplex” Geared Windmill
Double Ball
Bearing
Turntable
This is a distinctive and
exclusive feature to the
MOFFAT - VIRTUE
"SIMPLEX.” The
two ball races are of
exceptional diameter
and accurately mach-
ined to give easy and
steady rotation of the
mill on the tower. The
upper ball race carries
the weight of the mill
and the pumping load —the lower race takes
any upward thrust from the pump rod or
wrenching strain from wind pressure. The races are adjustable for wear.
Crosshead and Gear
Assembly
The twin gear wheels (7) operating through
the connecting rods (11) work the cross-
head sleeve (k) on the renewable guide
bar (L).
The top of the pump rod is fitted with a
swivel (N) which, together with all work-
ing parts in the gear box, is constantly
bathed in oil.
Pull-out Swivel
This part is not illustrated here, but it is ball
bearing—the "SIMPLEX” being the only
mill thus equipped. An ingenious spring
arrangement keeps the swivel in one posi-
tion when the mill is working and eliminates
all pull out gear troubles.


Moffat-Virtue “Simplex” Geared Windmill
Windwheel
The illustration reveals better than
any written description the excep-
tionally strong structure of this
important mill component. The
rims are angle steel —-much stronger
and more rigid than the usual flat
rims. The sails are secured by
wrought steel brackets on the lead-
ing edge and are direct bolted to
the rims on the trailing edge.
"SIMPLEX” Wheels are built to
withstand the heaviest storms.
Simplex Towers
These structures are the strongest
and most easily assembled towers
made. The angle steel legs butt
together and are secured with heavy
angle steel splice plates placed inside
the legs and strongly bolted. This
construction removes all shearing
stresses from the bolts and makes a
rigid firm structure. Tower heights
in every case are "above ground.”
Having 4 posts they are one-third
stronger than a 3-post structure.
We strongly recommend concrete tower foundations in
preference to all others.

Sizes: — 16 feet

The Mill of to-morrow to-day! These
Mills, even including the smallest (12
ft.), are seen at a glance to be designed
and built for extra heavy duty. Every-
thing about them suggests power and
dependability. They stand head and
shoulders above their contemporaries.
So great is the difference that they
should not be compared with other
mills on the basis of wheel diameter
alone. Other things being equal, a
MOFFAT-VIRTUE "SIMPLEX” Direct-Acting Mill of given wheel diameter will do the
work of larger sized mills of the usual type. Here are just a few of the reasons: —
BALL BEARINGS THROUGHOUT,
FORCED Feed Lubrication.
COMPLETELY enclosed.
POSITIVELY dust and weather proof.
ADJUSTABLE Governing—Quick and Positive.
SENSITIVE to the finest degree on Double Ball
Bearing Turntable.

The MOFFAT-VIRTUE ||^

ing Windmill HAS BALL
BEARINGS THROUGHOUT. This is
no exaggeration. The windwheel shaft, of
course, runs on ball bearings, and the
double ball bearing turntable is an exclusive
feature to the "SIMPLEX,” but the follow-
ing— contrary to general practice—are also
ball bearing:
Crank Pin Bearing. Crosshead Bearing.
Pump Rod Swivel and Pull-out Swivel.
LUBRICATION ■
Oiling of all working parts in the crank-case above the level of the main body of oil is by
means of a very strong and simple oil circulator in the bottom of the crank-case. The vane
hinge pin rests in a well of oil fed from the main supply. The double ball bearing turntable
has its own independent oil well. Thus the lubrication of this mill is complete and thorough.
The crank-case is sealed against the weather, but inspection doors are provided in top and side
of case, as the adjacent picture shows.
THE COMBINATION OF BALL BEARINGS WITH A POSITIVE OILING
SYSTEM IS THE COMPLEMENT TO THE STRENGTH AND PRECISION OF
THE MECHANISM.

Farther Points of Moffat-Virtue
“Simplex” Direct-Acting Windmills
The Windwheel: Upon this part of the mill falls
the responsibility for collecting the power from
the wind. To obtain the best results the sails
must be correctly designed and "pitched”. The
whole structure must be balanced for easy run-
ning and built to take the battering of the
heaviest storms. The use of angle steel rims and
the bolting of the sails to the rims, with wrought
steel brackets in front and directly at the back,
makes the wheel almost unbreakable.
Inspection Ladder: This being bolted to the turn-
table revolves with the mill. The mechanic
inspecting or adjusting the mill is thus comfort-
able and cannot be injured.
Pull-Out Gear: Is entirely separated from the
Pump Rod so cannot chafe. The ball bearing
pull-out swivel eliminates fouling of the pull-out
cable and obstruction to the rotation of the mill
on the turntable.
Governing: On the gravity system is adjustable,
dependable and sensitive. It will take care of the
mill in the heaviest storms.
The Tower: A massive 4-post structure—graceful
but strong, the "SIMPLEX” Direct-Acting Mill
Tower forms a safe platform for the valuable
machine it is designed to support.

SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs:
The Moffat-Virtue Simplex Windmill installed in April, 1940, on this property has been
in constant use ever since.
It has given every satisfaction, pumping from a 120 ft. bore to a tank on a nearby
hill 70 ft. above the bore.
The season during the last twelve months has been exceptionally dry, and the mill
has provided a constant supply of water for the homestead and two dairies. The water
has also been used for flower and vegetable gardens, through five sprinklers.
It has cost nothing for repairs, and has proved a very valuable asset to the property.
We would not like to be without it. Yours faithfully
EDGAR DOWNES.

MOFFAT-VIRTUE WINDMILL PUMPS
(Cylinder)
Fig. P 1.
Screw Cap
Pump.
Fig. P 3.
Side Bolt
Pump.
Many windmills, highly efficient in themselves, have been wrongly con-
demned because handicapped by pumps of bad design or poor quality
work and materials. Those here illustrated represent the best of their
kind, being the product of specialists.
Fig. P 2.
Flush Cap
Pump.
Any of the above pumps can be and often are used for installation above
ground, pumping from shallow wells, or surface water, such as rivers and
dams. When the water has to be forced a considerable distance above
the pump by meayis of a stuffing box or packing tube, however, it is better
to use a Syphon or Side Delivery Pump, as these are designed specially
for the purpose. (Refer to page 104.)
Fig. PI.
Is the Screw Cap Pump used in wells or in bores where the
outside diameter of the pump is small enough to leave
sufficient clearance inside the bore casing.
Fig. P 2.
The Flush Cap Pump enables the largest pump diameter
in relation to the overall diameter of the pump to be used,
thus allowing the greatest possible quantity of water to be
pumped from within the restricted diameter of standard
bore casing.
Fig. P 3.
The Side Bolt Pump is unsuitable for installation in bores
owing to its large overall diameter by comparison with its
cylinder diameter. For use in wells however, it is the most
popular of the cylinder pumps because of its accessibility
when renewing pump leathers or making adjustments to
the working parts of the pump.


MOFFAT-VIRTUE WINDMILL PUMPS
(Draw Plunger)
Fig. P 4.
Ball Valve
Draw
Plunger
Pump.
These Pumps are primarily designed for use in
Bores. For Delivery, socketed Galvanized Pipe,
or special Galvanized Pump Casing is used; its
inside diameter being larger than that of the Pump
enables the Pump Plunger and bottom Valve to be
drawn through the Delivery Pipe to ground level
by means of the Pump Rod. To pick up the bot-
tom valve the Pump Rods with Plunger attached
to their bottom end are lowered and revolved until
the corresponding thread on Plunger and bottom
valve engage. The whole assembly is then with-
drawn from the Pump Cylinder leaving it and the
long string of delivery pipe undisturbed in the
Bore.
By this means the arduous work and heavy expense
of hauling all the below ground equipment up
every time a pump bucket is renewed, or some other
small adjustment made, is avoided.
Draw Plunger Pumps must be exceptionally well
made for efficiency, and dependability. Placed
hundreds of feet below ground with valuable live
stock dependent upon them they should be of the
best quality procurable. The Pumps here illustrated
are without doubt the best of their kind. The
Mushroom Valve Pumps are generally favoured
for pumping depths to 300 ft. For greater eleva-
tions the Ball Valve Pump is designed and is often
preferred. However, the choice of type is largely
a matter of personal experience, and preference.

MOFFAT-VIRTUE WINDMILL PUMPS
(Syphon and Side Delivery)
Fig. P 6.
Syphon Pump.
Fig. P8.
Figure P 6 illustrates a Syphon Pump of the high-
est grade of material and workmanship. A heavy
cast iron outer barrel houses the all-brass working
cylinder within. The Suction Inlet placed high
in the outer barrel ensures the working cylinder
being always submerged in water, and thus per-
manently primed. Instead of the usual screwed
stuffing box, the delivery head has a packed gland
with studs and nuts. The special packing used is
evenly compressed to form a water-tight seal.
Made in sizes 2in., 2jin. and 3in. with strokes up
to 12in.
Figure P 7 represents an all-brass Side Delivery
Pump. The stuffing box is built into the pump.
The valves are easily accessible for inspection and
the complete plunger can be removed by undoing
two top flange bolts. There are lugs on top and
bottom castings for bolting to an upright founda-
tion post or, alternatively, there are two lugs on
the bottom casting for securing with coach bolts
to bed logs. Sizes 2in., 2jin., 3in., 3jin., 4in.,
4iin., sin. and 6in.
Figure P 8 illustrates the Packing Tube (sometimes called
Differential Head). This can be fitted to Discharge Tee
at the head of Vertical Delivery Pipe in bores and wells
to force the water to a greater height; also used on syphon
or side delivery pumps in place of packing box. A plunger
in the tube has two pump buckets which are expanded by
the pressure of the water from the pump and thus make a
watertight seal. This excellent device must be used with
caution in conjunction with pumps of small diameter. Under
such conditions too large a proportion of load coming on
the down stroke may cause a mill to knock. Where condi-
tions are suitable, however, the packing tube holds the water
well and needs little attention.
Figure PlO shows the ordinary screwed brass Stuffing Box
which is supplied with a length of brass rod. It is used for
the same purpose and in a similar way as the Packing Tube
described on this page.

PUMP RODS
Fig. P11.
Fig. P13.
Fig. Pll; Shows a Ball Joint Connection which
can be welded into Solid Steel Rods or Galvanized
Pipe Rods. It is strong, rigid, and very quickly
disconnected—saving time when pulling rods to
the surface from bore or well. Apart from their
strength and the ease of connecting and discon-
necting when pulling the rods from a bore, these
Joints have no loose parts which can be dropped
down the delivery pipe to cause trouble in the
Pump.
Fig. Pl 2: Ball Joint Connections as applied to
wooden pump rods. Such Rods are popular for
bore work with Draw Plunger Pumps.
Fig. Pl 3: Galvanized Fish Plate Joint for use with
wooden pump rods (alternative to Fig. Pl 2).
Apart from the lower cost of the Fish Plate Joints,
they are sometimes preferred on their merits.

Steel or Pipe Rods, is a widely used type.
Such Sockets can be used to adapt one size and

MOFFAT-VIRTUE “SIMPLEX” PUMP JACKS AND PUMPING HEADS
Fig. A22.
Fig. A 25 is identical with A 22 so far as the lifting
mechanism and belt pulley arrangements are con-
cerned. Instead of the side-arms and clamp type
crosshead, however, it has a combination delivery
head and air chamber, the pump rods being lifted
by semi-steel connecting rods through a crosshead
guided by bars of polished steel. Instead of the
usual stuffing box with greasy hemp packing, this
head is provided with a large diameter rod work-
ing in a gland of special hydraulic packing.
Both Fig. A 22 and A 25 are made in two sizes,
designated in each case by the longest working
stroke. Thus the lOin. Jack, or lOin. Pumping
Head, has strokes of sin., 7\ in. and (the longest)
lOin. The capacity of a given size is identical
whether fitted out as a Pump Jack or a Pumping
Head.
Specifications and pumping capacities set out on the opposite
page apply to the Pumping Heads. The same particulars
cover the Pump Jacks, except that the lOin. Jack weighs
115 lbs. and the 14in. 131 lbs.
In these machines are embodied all the features
necessary for pumping as auxiliaries to windmills
or for continuous operation as self-contained units.
The illustrations will show the clean-cut design
and exceptionally sturdy construction, and it
should be noted that no overhanging strains can
come on the mechanism. The machines being
double geared the lift on the crosshead is equally
distributed on the two large spur wheels. Like-
wise the power from the belt pulley is applied
equally to the semi-steel spur wheels by means of
the driving pinions which are milled from solid
steel.
Fig. A 22 shows a Pump Jack with hardwood side-
arms and a crosshead to clamp on to mill or pump
rods. These Jacks are designed principally for
use with windmills, especially when the discharge
tee is high above the ground and of the open
top type.

Moffat-Virtue “Simplex” Pumping Heads
A self-contained engine-driven pumping unit as shown
in the accompanying illustration (Fig A 24) is well
adapted to permanent installation on a well or bore, or
can be transported from one bore site to another as an
auxiliary to a windmill. When used in the latter
capacity a Pump Jack is usually preferred.
The Engine and Pumping Head (or Pump Jack) are
mounted on a strong channel steel base and the drive
is by means of a vee belt working from a grooved pulley
on the engine to a flat faced pulley on pumping head
or pump jack.
The lOin. Head drives with a 1% h.p. M-V Petrol
Engine, and the 14in. Head with 4 h.p. M-V Petrol-
Kerosene Engine.
The tables set out below apply to all Pumping Heads

POWER DRIVEN PUMPS
Fig. P34.
Three Standard Sizes of Pumps—and are provided as standard
equipment, their capacity ranging from 900 to 1500 gallons per hour at
elevations up to 60ft. The exact capacity of any unit depends on the actual
pumping conditions. We design the Vee Belt Drive to give the maximum
output according to the purchaser’s individual needs. Larger pumps than
can be adapted to this type of plant.
Moffat-Virtue Farm Pumper
Fig. P 35. The Moffat-Virtue Farm Pumper is a small
pumping outfit. It makes an excellent auxiliary to any wind-
mill up to about 14 feet in size, and may be moved easily
from site to site.
The Engine is of the vertical type, air cooled type and oper-
ates on the four cycle principle. It is fitted with a high-class
rotary magneto, and runs on petrol. The side arms, pump-
rod guide and crosshead as illustrated, are included in the
price. There are no extras to buy.
Installation is easy. Simply bolt to a solid foundation and
clamp the crosshead to the pump-rod.
Fig. P 34. This splendid little plant, popularly
known as the "Dandy Pumper,” was designed
for pumping domestic and stock supplies from
surface water such as creeks and dams, or
shallow wells. It is also ideal for dewatering
Cellars, Foundations, Stock Dips and other gen-
eral purposes within the range of its capacity.
Consistent with MOF-
FAT-VIRTUE Products
it is splendidly con-
structed and finished, and
represents a smart reli-
able self-contained unit.

TANKS
There are two standard, types of Galvanized Iron Tanks, Soldered and Bolted.
As it is not feasible to supply Tanks complete for transport except in very small sizes, it is our
practice to supply all the necessary material, with the Corrugated Sheets for the sides ready
curved.
The Soldered Type Tanks have all seams rivetted and soldered—the usual rainwater house
tank being a common example of this type. They are usually employed in sizes up to 10,000
gallons, but occasionally Tanks of this type are made up to 20,000 gallons. Material includes,
Galvanized Corrugated Iron for sides, Plain Galvanized Iron for bottom, and top, Tap and
Socket, Solder, Rivets and Washers. Spirits of Salts is not included as standard specification.
These Tanks can be supplied with or without Tops.
BOLTED TYPE TANKS: These are similar in every way to the Soldered Type except that the
joints of the sides are bolted, with bitumen packing strips laid between the laps of the sheets
and treated with a special solution to form a watertight joint. Alternatively, blanket strips
soaked in red oxide and oil can be used for the joints.
This construction is stronger and more resilient for tank sides than rivetted and soldered joints.
The bottom, however, is rivetted and soldered in the usual way. Tops are not provided as
standard, but can be supplied at an extra cost.
CORRUGATED IRON STANDS: These consist of a ring of corrugated iron with rivetted
joints. They are filled with earth to the top to form a cheap but effective foundation for the
tank.
TANK RINGS; To stiffen the top edge of the sides of the Tank we can supply a flat galvanized
steel band, or for tanks of large capacity angle steel rings. These stiffening agents are bolted
into the top corrugation of the tank sides.

STEEL TANKSTANDS AND STEEL TANKS
STEEL TANKSTANDS: The
design of these structures is particu-
larly strong and well proportioned.
If properly erected on good founda-
tions they will retain their shape
indefinitely under the load. They
can be placed near a Station Home-
stead without detracting from the
appearance of the buildings. Our
Steel Tank Stands are a permanent
and highly valuable improvement
on any country property. See
weights below.
Steel Tankstands
Weights in lbs.
Weights, complete with Hardwood Timber
Decking.
Fig. T2.
Fig. T3.
Fig. T 2.
These Tanks are made with
heavy gauge black or galvanized
plain steel sheets, bolted together.
The sheets need to be of heavy
gauge because they have not the
stiffening effect of corrugations.
An angle steel stiffening ring is
provided for the top and bottom
edges of the sides, and in the
larger sizes internal diagonal
steel stays are provided. Made
with or without tops as required.


TROUGHING
Fig. T4.
Steel Frame Trough-
ing for Sheep or
Cattle as above-illust-
rated has become
practically standard
equipment in recent
years. We supply all
the material complete ready to erect.
Fig. T5.
For the Landholder with ample supplies of
bush or sawn timber available we supply
troughing for wood
frame, consisting of the
galvanized iron sheets,
curved, clips and
bands for joining to-
gether the sheets, gal-
vanized clouts for
fastening the sheets to
wooden side rails, and bolts for bolting the
side rails to the posts. All timber and any
extra bolts or other material required to make
the frames are supplied by the purchaser.
Fig. T6.
Fibro-cement troughing —
this is a special new line.
There is no doubt it fills a
long felt want, especially in
districts where iron troughs
are quickly destroyed by
hard water. The specifica-
tion includes the necessary
bolts and bitumen com-
pound for the joints. The
joints are easily and quickly
made, and will remain abso-
lutely watertight. Made up
Fig. T4.
Fig. T5.
Fig. T6.
in 8 ft. lengths, this trough measures 15-inches wide (inside measurements) at the top and is
9-inches deep.
The shape allows the lengths to be "nested” in one another for transport, and the flat bottom
enables the trough to be set on sleepers and easily aligned. This trough should be protected
against possible damage by heavy stock by a timber framework. It will then be practically ever-
lasting irrespective of the quality of water stored.


TANK AND TROUGH FITTINGS
Fig. T8.
Fig. T 8 shows a popu-
lar tank connection
for pipe up to 1i"
in size, consisting of
a pair of galvanised
corrugated washers
with a long screw
secured thereto by
backnuts inside and
out.
Fig. T10.
Fig. Tl 3. FULL WAY FLOATVALVE.
Made in sizes 1", U", li", 2 ", 2i" and 3".
Designed to allow a maximum flow of water
from tank to trough under low pressure
heads. This valve was developed as a result
of long practical experience and is highly
dependable in operation.
Ball Cocks to stand high water pressures can
also be supplied.
Fig. T 7. The CORRUGATED
TANK OUTLET FLANGE is
the strongest and most satisfac-
tory connection for pipe to cor-
rugated iron tanks. It consists
of a pair of cast iron flanges,
one inside, and the other out-
side the tank with bolts passing
right through. A watertight
joint is secured with blanket
soaked in oxide clamped
between the outer flange, and
the side of the tank. Leather
Washers under the heads of the
bolts prevent seepage of water
at these points.
Fig. T9.
Fig. T 9 and Fig. TlO show the
ANGLE STEEL RING and FLAT
GALVANISED BAND respectively
for stiffening the top edge of OPEN
TOP TANKS of large diameter. The
flat steel band is usually employed
with tanks from 2000 to 5000 gallons
capacity, but can be supplied on any
size of tank. The angle steel ring
is usually employed only with tanks
of 5000 gallons capacity, and larger.
Both are supplied in sections —the
angle steel being curved —and bolts
are supplied for attaching to the tank.
Fig. Til. The TANK DEPTH INDI-
CATOR here illustrated is strong,
simple and trouble-free. A lower
priced indicator without the num-
bered board can be supplied.

CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS
Standard Low Medium Lift Pump. Class L,
2 to 6 inches.
Water Data
One acre-inch is the quantity
of water required, to cover one
acre of area a depth of one
inch—equals 3,630 cubic feet,
or 22,660 Imperial gallons.
One acre-foot equals 12 acre-
inches—equivalent of 43,560
cubic feet, or 271,920 Imperial
gallons.
One cubic foot per second
(known as "Cusec”) equals 375
Imperial gallons per minute. A-
flow of one "Cusec” will pro-
duce one acre-inch in about an
hour.
One pound per square inch
pressure is equivalent to the
pressure of a column of water
2.31 feet high.
A column of water one foot in
height produces a pressure of
.433 pounds per square inch.
Centrifugal Pumps are play-
ing an ever increasing part in
Australia in pumping water
supplies and operating irriga-
tion plants. The accompany-
ing illustrations show typical
centrifugal pumps, one with
pulleys for belt drive and the
other direct-coupled to an
electric motor. The illustrations show the latest
improved W.F.D. pump with long renewable gun-
metal bearings and ring oiler lubrication. The
trunnion bearing and clamp which hold the pump
bowl in position are of unusually heavy construc-
tion. This important feature prevents misalign-
ment or distortion of the pump bowl due to the
strains imposed by suction and delivery pipes when
carelessly installed.
Made in low lift and high lift series, single and two
stage, these pumps are efficient and trouble-free.
Other leading makes of centrifugal and special
turbine pumps can be supplied.
Standard High Lift Direct-coupled Centrifugal
Pump.


CENTRIFUGAL PUMP LAYOUTS
Layout A.
Pumps up to about 3in. usually have
wrought iron socketed pipes as
shown. If the pump connections
and footvalve are flanged, com-
panion or matching flanges must be
provided. When belt-driven from
the top of the bank the delivery
should be on the underside as
shown, to keep the belt pull under-
neath, and a pet cock fitted to
release air from the pump bowl.
Layout B.
Large centrifugal pumps usually have flanged galvanized sheet steel pipes as shown. If the
delivery can be arranged on top as with direct-coupled or v-belt-driven pumps, a pet cock is
not essential. No companion flanges are needed, as the pipes themselves are flanged.
NOTE: The gate valve and pressure gauge are desirable when pumping against high heads or
into spray systems; otherwise they can be deleted.

MOFFAT-VIRTUE SPRAY IRRIGATION
MOFFAT-VIRTUE TRAILER SYSTEM.
The sprays at left are on the Spray Pipe Line;
those at right are on Trailers.
Give us Rain !
What a country Australia would
be with an assured rainfall! But of
what avail to lament this handicap.
There is a way out —
Irrigation points the way
The knocks Australia takes from drought periodically can and must be countered if we are to
do justice to the development of our country. Farmers and graziers—principal victims of
drought—only need security from their old enemy to protect their investments and reap a
full reward from their personal efforts. Irrigation by the flood or drain system is still
preferred by some farmers where conditions are favourable. This method, however, needs
large supplies of water, reasonably flat land, and soil which will not cake and "scald”. For
results obtained it is often wasteful of water. In so many districts we simply cannot afford
this waste.
For Spray Irrigation, on the other hand, large water supplies are not essential. Many farmers
have found to their surprise and profit, how much can be done with the Moffat-Virtue System,
operating on restricted water supplies.
Wasteful methods of irrigation have a boomerang effect on the irrigationist by depriving him
of supplies when they are most needed—when streams run low. The successful farmer or
grazier anticipates drought and meets it more than half way. With the modern Moffat-Virtue
Spray System he can make dry periods a source of profit instead of the loss which, in the past,
was considered the inevitable result of drought.
The first move
IRRIGATION PLANTS, especially of the spray type, should be designed by experts. The
Firm of MOFFAT-VIRTUE LIMITED offers information and advice on these matters, free
of obligation. Their Irrigation Engineers are practical men with much country experience and
are familiar with the difficulties confronting the Man on the Land. It is their pleasure to be
of assistance to you.


What makes a good Spray Irrigation Plant ?
A successful Spray Irrigation System
(apart from the actual pumping plant)
resolves itself round three main essen-
tials;
1. The galvanized Pipe Line to con-
vey the water wherever needed.
2. The Pipe Coupling, to connect the
pipes with greatest speed and least
possible labour.
3- The Sprays, to distribute the water
evenly on the crop or pasture.

Irrigation Pipes
With the Spray Main and Spray Pipe Lines well and strongly made and mounted with the
best Couplings procurable, the Irrigationist has the main structure of a profit earning plant.
In the actual making up of the pipes we do not follow usual methods of rivetting and soldering.
Instead we have introduced a system of uniform manufacture to a very exacting specification
carried out by experienced tradesmen to ensure pipes as strong, resilient, and water-tight as
man can make them. The importance of this practical point cannot be overstressed.
The “M-V” Irrigation Pipe Coupling
This all-important fitting represents the latest ideas developed from long experience and
research.
FLEXIBILITY: Recognising the necessity for extreme flexibility we have produced a Coupling
which provides for maximum flexibility both vertically and horizontally to provide for undulations
and deflections respectively in the pipe line, to meet the most difficult land contours.
SPEED IN OPERATION beyond anything yet known, has been achieved because the Clamp
Levers guide the two halves of the Coupling together, ensuring alignment automatically before
coupling pressure is applied.
WATER-TIGHT: The Patented Diamond Section Rubber Sealing Ring is held with only
moderate pressure when the Coupling is clamped. Water pressure within the pipes does the
rest, expanding the lip of the Sealing Ring against the concave surface of the mating flange,
resulting in a thoroughly water-tight Coupling. The Sealing Rings are reversible, thus giving
double life.
EXPANSION JOINTS: Every Coupling is in effect an Expansion Joint. Because the Clamps
are made of spring steel, this lengthwise resilience protects Pipe and Couplings from damage
through expansion and contraction from varying temperatures. So simple is the Coupling that
it could be taken to pieces and reassembled in a few moments without tools. The Clamping
Levers are supplied loose (with leather pouch for carrying on the Operator’s belt).

FLEXIBILITY

flexibility of Couplings in Spray Pipe Lines.
The accompanying illust-
rations show how the
M-V Coupling permits
of deflection of the pipe
lines from an angle off
the straight line. This
feature permits irrigation
over heavy, undulating ground and to areas of irregular and awkward shape. Such
is the design and construction of the coupling that no strain is imposed on the pipes
by offsetting one
pipe from another.

IRRIGATION SPRAYS
Fig. IR.2.
M-V CHOKELESS SPRAY.
Two types of spray, according to conditions and local
requirements, are available with the M-V Spray Irriga-
tion Pipes.
CHOKELESS SPRAY, Fig. 1R.2, is made of heavy
cast brass and has unusually large water orifices to permit
the passage of foreign bodies —burrs, grasshoppers,
shrimps, willow leaves, and so on. For all practical pur-
poses it is true to name —''CHOKELESS”. Used v on
every coupling of the spray pipe line, these Sprays are
spaced 17j feet apart and thoroughly spray an area
18 feet x 18 feet.
The rate of watering equals approximately 1 inch to inches of rain per hour. Where
the available water is exceptionally dirty this Spray is most valuable, since it clears itself
and needs no attention.
JET SPRAY, Fig. 1R.3, has the advantage of covering
a very large area, being spaced 35 feet apart (every
second coupling of the spray pipe line). Sprays evenly
in a square pattern 35ft. x 35ft. Its use entails a small
number of shifts for a given area.
Three rates of discharge, according to the No. of dome
supplied with the spray, can be obtained.
No. 0 gives approximately of rain per hour

Only one dome is supplied with each Spray, but extra
domes can be supplied separately. They are inter-
changeable.

JET TYPE SPRAY.
The Sprays described above cover almost every conceivable need, but for special or
unusual conditions other types and makes of sprays can be used with the M-V
Irrigation Pipe System. When desired we can supply pipes with M-V Couplings in 24ft.
or other lengths to suit sprays of other makes, or special individual requirements.
Extensions to existing plants of other makes, with M-V Irrigation Pipes, can be arranged.

MOFFAT-VIRTUE
(PATENTED)
TRAILER SYSTEM
halves the labour !
This outstanding invention
marks a great step forward
in Spray Irrigation since it
gets to the very core of the
Irrigation Farmer’s most
urgent need —curtailment of
labour.
THE MOFFAT-VIRTUE TRAILER SPRAY.
(Hose extends straight out at right angles to
spray pipe when in operation.)
The usual spray pipe line with sprays at intervals is employed. Halfway between each spray a
"take off” is provided to a "Trailer Hose” which has at its extremity a spray mounted upon a
light steel runner. Thus two lines of sprays work off one line of metal pipe. As each metal
pipe is moved to the line of the second spray position, the Trailer Spray is drawn along on
its hose. This Trailer Spray will glide over rough ground without trouble and with hardly
noticeable extra effort. Finally it automatically comes to rest in its proper position ready for
spraying, as its parent metal pipe is dropped into line.
The Trailer Sprays, being "staggered” in relation to those on the Metal Spray Line, the whole
of the area is watered evenly. The effect of this device is to enable two Spray Lines to be
shifted with the labour involved in moving one Spray Line in other systems. Instead of
moving the metal Spray Line 17jft., 24ft., or 35ft. (according to the type and make of Spray),
it is moved 35ft., 48ft., or 70ft.
respectively. In other words,
two lines of sprays are moved
forward along the main with
the labour usually involved
for one line. Thus whatever
type or brand of Spray is used
m conjunction with our Trailer
System, the labour of moving
the Spray Lines will be
approximately halved.
The accompanying illustra-
tions clarify the foregoing
notes.

FLOW OF WATER THROUGH PIPE
Shorter or longer lengths of pipe have different capacities; therefore, the I,oooft. capacities above’should be multiplied by the
factor shown in the following table, according to the length of pipe required or used.
The size of a known length of pipe necessary to discharge a certain quantity of water from a known elevation or head can easily
be found from the above tables.
Example—Find the size of pipe 150 ft. long that will allow a flow of 600 gallons per hour from a supply at an elevation or
head of 75 ft.
As the pipe sizes are given for I,oooft. lengths, the equivalent discharge for I,oooft. must be obtained by dividing the discharge
for 150 ft., viz.: 10 gals, per min., by the factor for 150 ft., i.e., about 2.7, equals 10 divided by 2.6 equals 3.8 gals, per min.
for I,oooft. length. Size of pipe for 3.8 gals, per min. at 75ft. head equals about Jin. dia. equals Answer.


The New Simplified
MOFFAT-VIRTUE
MILKING MACHINE
The culmination of over thirty years’ experience
As one of the earliest pioneers of the Milking Machine in Aus-
tralia, MOFFAT-VIRTUE LTD. have had as their objective the
production of a Milker which could be sold to the farmer at a
much lower price than has applied in the past, and that would
be Simple, Hygienic and Economical to run.
Costs have been reduced, as to-day we do not pay away outside
manufacturing profits, all parts being made in our own factory,
by the most efficient machinery procurable for the purpose, with
the result that the price to the farmer is not loaded with unneces-
sary intermediate profits. If the Australian Dairyfarmer is to
compete successfully in the markets of the world, not only with
other butter-producing countries, but also with the ever-increasing
number of substitutes, he must realise that he cannot afford to
disregard economical methods of production. THE NEW
MOFFAT-VIRTUE MILKER will definitely enable you to intro-
duce production economies. Not only is machine-milking by our
method quicker, cleaner and more hygienic than hand milking—
it is cheaper and more efficient, by far, than any other machine
method in use to-day, and the cows receive better treatment.
You owe it to yourself and your family to instal a “M-V”

COPY OF LETTER.
The Manager,
Moffat-Virtue (Q’ld.) Pty. Ltd., "Fairhill” Ayrshire Stud,
Box 86, Post Office, Oakey, Queensland.
TOOWOOMBA, Q.
Dear Sir,
I have had considerable experience with various makes of Milking Machines on other
than Stud herds.
'With my Stud Ayrshire herd care had to be exercised in the selection of Machines,
and, now that Moffat-Virtue Machines were selected and have been in use for three years,
I feel it my duty to have you acquainted with the highly satisfactory results they have given.
My Stud herd is under official Government test, and test cows are milked by Machines
up till the night of the actual test. I find that with your Machines there is no tendency of
milk being held back when cows are hand milked for actual test or, at a later date, put back
on to Machine milking.
Proof of the ease with which your machines can be kept clean is borne out by my having
CHOICE on all occasions during the first twelve months, the only exception being one can
of First Grade which was traced back to feed taint.
In expressing myself in this manner I wish your Company every success and permit your
use of my expression in any way you may desire.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) M. J. BROWNLIE,
"Fairhill” Ayrshire Stud,
Oakey, Queensland.

THE MOFFAT-VIRTUE
SIMPLIFIED MILKING MACHINE
is easy to buy—
At last the Dairyfarmer is able to have the comforts and convenience of machine-milking at a
cost that he can afford even when the price of butter-fat is low.
Do you realise that you can have all this for a very small deposit, and by paying a little over
a pound per week it soon becomes your own property. AN ASSET.
The alternative in many cases is paying a higher amount for wages and keep, and at the end
of the period you have no asset. And remember, the M-V Milker is always there, and fully
efficient.
Furthermore, it is simple to operate. Not a single adjustment to be made to the milker
once the vacuum is set. A child can work it. And as there are no corners for dirt
to lodge you are sure of “Choicest” Cream at every milking, resulting in the maximum
cheque from the factory each month.
DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY SAVE IT
is cheap to run —
Owing to the exclusive design of the New Moffat-Virtue Milker friction has been reduced to
an absolute minimum, with a corresponding saving in power and fuel costs.
The following table will give you some idea of what our latest product can do for you.
Compare it with your present times and costs, and remember the longer your cows are on the
pastures, the more they are earning for you.
. , . Read what Mr. V. G.
KESBY of "Glendene,” Mac-
leay River, has to say —
“It is twelve months to-day
since we commenced running
the M-V MILKING PLANT,
and it is with pleasure and
great satisfaction that I give
you some interesting figures.
. . Repairs to engine, Ud.
(fourpence) . . .
“During twelve months it
cost us S/U (three shillings
and fourpence) per week.
. . . During the time we had
eighty cows in, I was very
careful in checking, and we
milked eighty cows for Bd.
<eightpence) per day. . . .
We have had the greatest
satisfaction in every way,
the plant being ECON-
OMICAL, SANITARY AND
EFFICIENT, ALSO VERY
SIMPLE . . . our plant is
open for inspection at any
time to would-be purchasers.”
“Yours truly,
“(Sgd.) V. G. KESBY.”
The third column of the above table includes time for
washing up the plant, while the fifth column makes
similar provision.
If a Kerosene operated or Diesel Engine is used the
operating cost may be reduced by 45% or 62 j%
respectively.
A safe estimate of the capacity of our milking machine
(in cows milked) is from 10 to 12 cows per hour per
unit. Should you wish to cut down the actual milking
time this can be done by installing a larger size plant
for a given number of cows.


The following Important Features are covered
by Patents, and are NOT found in
any other machine
made of heavy cast bronze or spun copper, heavily nickel
plated and polished, with the result that this important
component is fully resistant to lactic acids.
Releases 90 times per minute, and
owing to its exclusive principle
milk cannot accumulate in the
pipe line or back up in the
releasor, to be drawn through
into the pump.
Can be completely dismantled
for washing in 10 seconds. Has
no obscure corners to harbour
dirt or bacteria.
All parts of the releaser are
The Moffat - Virtue Quick Action
DOUBLE RELEASER
The Moffat-Virtue Rotary Pulsator
Constantly rotating, self-
aligning pulsator. Positively
driven. Consists of two
parts only, and these prac-
tically everlasting.
Simplicity itself. Can be
dismantled in five seconds. -
No adjustments needed.
Separate port for each side of releaser and
pulsator pipe line, ensuring perfectly bal-
anced operation of releaser, and even pulsa-
tion on the teat cups. This device reduces
stripping to an absolute minimum.


The Moffat-Virtue Adjustable Type
“Non-Sag” Soft Inflation Teat Cup
Easy on the Cows
A good all round fast milker and non-corrosive. Readily dismantled and
inflations easily tightened. Extended lip and bulb top prevents injury to
the cow and also loss of vacuum. Suitable for
any standard make of machine, and all types of
cows. Cup with moulded inflation can also be
supplied when required.
The Moffat-Virtue Claw
The claw in any milking plant probably receives rougher usage
than any other single part, and accordingly the Moffat-Virtue
claw has been designed and constructed to stand up to rough
handling. The cross tubes are built in with the air and milk
tubes so as to form a strongly braced unit of great strength.
Easy cleaning and automatic shut off should the cups be kicked
off by the cow are other good features of the claw.
Vacuum Gauge and Relief Valve Assembly
This illustration shows the Vacuum Gauge
and Relief Valve Assembly at the end of
the milk board. Note how the fresh air is
drawn past the end of the Vacuum Gauge,
which is above the milk line, thus keeping
it clean and away from the milk.
The bobbin "A” keeps the cleaning cord clear of the milk pipe whilst in operation and can
be used for looping the cord round when not in use.
THE MOFFAT.VIRTUE QUICK ACTION DOUBLE RELEASER IS UNEQUALLED


THE MOFFAT-VIRTUE STABILISING TRAP
Made of heavily plated copper.
Consists of two parts only. No
screws or clamps. It can be
instantly dismantled, and as there
are no corners the whole of the
spherical inside surfaces are very
easily and quickly cleaned.
Prevents moisture of any kind from reaching
the vacuum pump. Keeps the vacuum uniform
throughout the system.
The two hemispheres are vacuum-sealed by
means of a detachable rubber ring which is
interchangeable with those on the releaser.
With the New Moffat-Virtue Simplified Milking Machine
1. You Save Heavy Outlay on expensive
plant, because it is Australian, of simple
design and you buy direct from the
manufacturers.
2. You Save Fuel and Lubrication Costs,
because it takes much less power to
operate.
3. You Save Half the Time and Effort in
the daily cleaning because of its special
features.
4. You Save Replacement Costs, because
it has few wearing parts and is built for
long service.
5. You Save Losses on your Factory
Returns, because its simplicity and
hygienic features are your assurance of
"Choicest Cream.”
6. You Save Space and Oil Waste, because
it is compact and all working parts of
the pump and engine are totally enclosed
in an oiltight and dustproof casing.


ELECTRIC MOTOR
Where Electric Power is available we can
operate our Milking Plant by Electric
Motor, and invariably arrange for a Vee
Belt Drive, thus saving considerable space
and the drive itself is more effective.
When ordering a motor it is necessary to
state whether the current available is Single
Phase (240 Volts) or 3 Phase (415 Volts).
ROTARY VACUUM PUMP
The Rotary Vacuum Pump is a masterpiece
of engineering construction and built with
such precision and accuracy that many years
of satisfactory and trouble free running are
assured. This pump is exceptionally easy
to drive, requiring a minimum of power to
operate, and consequently there are greatly
reduced running costs. All of the Milking
Plant Installations include one of these.
HERD TESTING BUCKET
It only pays to milk cows when they come up to the
standard as milk producers.
Each cow should be tested to make sure her production
warrants her keep, because a poor producer requires
just as much grazing as the best cow in the herd.
Cull out the drones by periodically testing with a
Moffat-Virtue herd testing bucket.
This is a simple acquisition to our milking machine,
which makes herd testing a pleasure, as it is far easier
than doing so by hand.
The bucket is brought into operation in a few minutes
and the milk from any cow can be taken for test
purposes and measured or weighed without interfering
with the natural operation of the machines in the other
bails.

Perfect Sterilisation at amazingly low cost
THE NEW “M-V” BOILER STERILISER
It is an established scientific fact that only by high temperatures can bacteria be efficiently destroyed. So
far as the production of high grade milk or cream is concerned, steam is the only practical medium of
obtaining positive results. Boiling water loses its temperature by radiation through coming into contact with
the milk line. Consequently the equipment becomes a source of contamination —a veritable breeding ground
for bacteria. Steam reaches every surface at a minimum temperature of 212 deg. F., thereby effecting a
degree of commercial sterility which is otherwise impossible. Milk from healthy cows is practically pure,
and only by contact with unsterilised equipment does it become
loaded with bacteria, which, finding a plentiful food supply and
congenial warmth in the milk, proceeds to multiply at an alarming
rate. This definitely causes low grading. Only by steam can suffi-
ciently high temperatures be obtained to give complete sterilisation,
thus assuring high grade milk or cream.
THE M-V BOILER STERILISER IS NEW—IT IS
DIFFERENT—THE SIMPLEST AND SAFEST YOU
CAN BUY!
Mr. Dairyman, you and thousands of other men demanded this Steri-
liser. For years you have wanted a Sterilising unit that will give an
abundance of wet, flowing steam —that is simple and safe—that is
economical—and above all, moderately priced. Well, here it is—
THE NEW M-V BOILER STERILISER.
This up-to-the-minute outfit will give you ample Boiling Water for
washing the Milking Plant and Utensils, and also supply wet, flowing
steam for Sterilising. A few pieces of firewood is the only fuel needed
to raise sufficient steam to sterilise the Milk Line, Droppers and
Teat Cups whilst they are in position, and provision is also made
for sterilising Cream Cans, Buckets and other Utensils. The wet
steam cleanses and sterilises much quicker than dry or "pressure”
steam, and is acknowledged by experts to be much more effective.
With the M-V Boiler Steriliser there is no chance of baking the
Casein or the milk pipe line, nor will it, by creating excessive heat,
cause it to buckle. The M-V Boiler Steriliser will effectively sterilise
any size Milking Plant up to 6 units. It is so very safe—and so
very simple to understand and operate that a child can use it. The
Frame, Cover and Steaming Rack of the M-V Boiler Steriliser is of
Cast Iron, and the Boiler itself of Heavy Gauge Copper Sheeting,
ensuring years of satisfactory service. The Cover and Steaming
Rack are heavily galvanized.
Swift “Wonder” Steriliser
CAPACITY, 12 GALLONS, OIL BURNING MODEL.
This model is ideal for the average shed up to a four unit plant.
By closing the control tap a full head of steam or seven gallons
of boiling water may be obtained in twelve minutes, or by opening
the control tap the whole supply may be boiled at one time and
thereafter a continuous supply may be maintained at the rate of
approximately one gallon per minute. Three to four hours’ burning
on a gallon of cheap fuel oil is proof of its economy. It is safe,
simple and speedy! Rubbish and wood can also be used as fuel if
desired.


POWER ATTACHMENTS FOR SEPARATORS
When it is required to operate a Separator from a Power
Drive such as a Petrol Engine or Electric Motor, it is
necessary to provide means to gradually bring the power into
operation whilst the bowl of the Separator is gaining speed.
To do this either a fast and loose pulley arrangement or a
Friction Clutch as illustrated is generally utilised.
Lund Friction Clutch.
Buffalo Ball Bearing Drill
Friction Clutches or
Power Attachments

“M-V” PORTABLE ORCHARD SPRAY PLANTS
You cannot change the
habits of Orchard Pests
BUT
WE CAN
DESTROY THEM
You cannot afford to
have a poor sprayer,
because only the best
fruit is worth marketing,
and the M-V Plant will
enable you to produce
better fruit from the
same acreage.
The general design of our Spray Plant insures a constant speed and unvarying pressure under all normal
conditions, and built into it are many features suggested by practical Orchardists and which greatly add to
its success in operation, tending to greater efficiency, simplicity, and a long life service.
Much time and expense has been devoted to perfecting the M-V Totally Enclosed Vertical Twin Cylinder
Spray Pump. It is something Special and ENTIRELY NEW.
A highly efficient Pump with an amazing performance, will maintain a pressure up to 400 lbs. per square
inch and is capable of operating two coarse or four fine nozzles simultaneously, and the pressure can be
adjusted whilst the Pump is in operation.
All of the moving parts of the Pump are totally enclosed and run in a bath of oil, and the cylinders are
porcelain lined and can be quickly and easily detached if required for re-lining with porcelain.
Other Features of the Pump are:—
Special Buckets on the Plungers which are easily adjustable by means of expanders, stainless steel ball valves,
absence of packing glands, gear driven propeller agitators and specially designed "pressure unloader”.
The 100-gallon wooden vat is fitted with the rounded portion crosswise, so as to give ample clearance for the
heels of the horse drawing it, and also to afford better traction balance.
The wheels have a broad tread which enables the equip-
ment to be drawn over very soft country with ease, and
the Plant is provided with the usual High Pressure Hose,
Trigger Gun, Rods and Angle Nozzles,
The power is provided by the latest model Z\ H.P. M-V
Vertical Totally Enclosed Petrol Engine, full particulars
of which are given in the Engine Section of the
Catalogue, Page 65.
(A comprehensive brochure dealing with our Orchard
Spray Plant will be gladly furnished on request.)


THE NEW “M-V” UTILITY
ORCHARD SPRAY PLANTS
This equipment is to supply the
requirements of the Orchardist
who needs a Spraying Outfit of a
smaller capacity than the stand-,
ard model at a much reduced
price.
The design and general construc-
tion of this Plant lends itself to
spraying under such conditions
that would not be practicable
with the larger unit, and it is
specially suitable for Vineyards,
Tomato Plantations, Vegetable Gardens and Tobacco Growing, etc., as it can be easily transported
between rows due to its narrow width and Sprays for special methods of operation can be
provided at a small extra cost.
The patented Multi Pump Unit used on this outfit combines the utmost in Simplicity, Reliability,
Efficiency, and Economy in operation, and the driving mechanism is totally enclosed and
operates in a bath of oil.
There are no packing glands to absorb power and become worn by the abrasive contents of the
Spraying Liquid, and specially processed acid-resisting chrome leather buckets are used which
are so formed to enable them to withstand considerable abrasion and excessive bending without
any undue sign of cracking.
The Multi Pump is provided with non-corrosive metal ball valves seated on easily renewable
seats, and the agitation is carried out by a positively driven reciprocating paddle agitator which
maintains the Spraying Liquid at its maximum efficiency to the last drop.
The Utility Model is capable of maintaining two Sprays in constant operation at a pressure of
250 lbs. per square inch and can be supplied with either a 60 or 80-gallon wooden barrel.
The 60-gallon barrel is standard, and
a slight extra charge is made for the
larger one.
The Engine supplying the power for
this Unit is the same as on the larger
outfit, viz.:—

“M-V” HAY PRESS
Cheap Insurance against Drought Conditions
With your own Hay Press you can bale hay at nearly half what it has cost hitherto, and do
so when the hay is in its best condition.
One user states, "My cost to press 366 tons of oaten hay from stocks with 3 men and a Model
L Press with 5 H.P. Engine, were: Labour, £79/11/7; Wire, £32/5/4; Petrol and Oil, £9/3/4;
Sundries, £6/4/-. Total, £127/4/3, or 7/- per ton. Bands were not cut. Best day was 544 bales
of 73 lbs. each.
Two others each pressed and sold enough lucerne in a week to pay for their two presses.
Still another states that his baling cost him less than half what he had previously paid.
Nothing on the farm so quickly pays for itself. Baled hay, particularly lucerne, eliminates much
loss, as it can be baled sooner after cutting and undergoes much less handling. This preserves
the young, tender leaf which is usually lost where the
hay is left in the paddock for curing, then forked to
the load, and then to the stack. J/BKgKk

“M-V” HAY PRESS
Fodder Conservation Pays
Dr. A. H. V. Richardson, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Council of Scientific Research, Australia’s
highest authority, says:—
"One obvious method of counteracting the period of nutritional stress in the dry period is to feed
grass hay conserved during the flush spring growth. A large portion of the food value of pasture
during the growing period is not and cannot be used by stock, but is more or less wasted during
the summer and autumn. The mower can be used with advantage for controlling pasture growth
and for using feed more efficiently in the form of conserved meadow hay.
"At the Waite Institute a pasture of Phalaris-Wimmera rye-grass-subterranean clover has maintained
four sheep an acre on a 22 inch rainfall without any loss in weight during the long dry period,
when one half of the pasture was cut in spring and fed to the sheep in late summer and autumn.
Conservation as meadow hay each season, and the feeding of it to the stock during the period of
nutritional stress appears to be a sound method of fully utilising the pasture and of controlling
the composition of the sward.”
BALED HAT IS EASY TO CART - EAST TO STORE - EAST TO FEED
The advantages of baled hay over stacked hay are:—
1. Baled hay, especially lucerne preserves all the leaf and seed for feed.
2. Baled hay is easy to feed out and to transport.
3. Only baled hay can be marketed.
4. Baled hay occupies far less space than loose hay.
5. Less damage by bad weather, as bales can quickly be got under cover.
6. Fire risk is practically cut out.
THE MOST ECONOMICAL PRESS OFFERING
A PRESS FOR THE GRAZIER. —Hitherto, those conserving hay in bales have had to wait on the
convenience of the contractor, facing possible losses due to delays. The large presses used by contractors
are, with their large engine, too costly for the ordinary user. Also, contract baling runs into a lot of
money. Our presses sell at a price to suit users having only a relatively small area. They have proved
themselves' to be ideal for the individual grazier, as to both efficiency and economy.
TYPES.—The press can be supplied with or without engine as under:—
Model "M”: Drive, with engine of 31 h.p. or more; or by power take-off, or by belt from tractor or engine.
Has no high speed shaft or fly wheel (see below).
Model "L”; Drive, with engine of 5 h.p. or more; or by power take-off, or by belt from tractor or engine.
Has a high speed shaft and fly wheel (4 h.p. will drive it, but output is reduced).
OUTPUT.—Output depends on the condition and weight of crop, on the number and experience of those
working the press, and the suitability of power, so that it is impossible to give the exact figures. It presses
by volume—not weight. Assuming an average of these variable factors, three ordinarily experienced men
on the press can do 48 bales per hour, with Model "M.” Assuming 70lb. bales, this gives up to H tons
per hour, and Model "L,” with 5/6 h.p. engine, gives up to 40 cwt. per hour. Proper output is got by
feeding every ram stroke the maximum amount of 20 strokes per minute.
POWER.—Engine: Model "M.” Any engine can be used of 31 h.p. or more. If over 1000 r.p.m., order
a countershaft. Model "L” requires at least 4 h.p. engine. 5/6 h.p. is needed for full output. No
countershaft is needed for Model "L.”
TRACTOR BELT DRIVE: For Model "M” a countershaft must be ordered. It is an extra. Power Take-off
Drive: For tractors having a central power take-off, a power take-off gear box must be ordered. It is an
extra (see specification). This drive saves setting up in the field, as the press, being coupled to the tractor,
is instantly ready for work anywhere.
BELT: Nothing heavier that a 4-inch double ply must be used for Model "M.”
WORKS ANYWHERE: Baling can be done wherever desired —from stack, from hay swept into
convenient places, from cocks, and from windrows.
The quickest way to bale is by pressing at places to which hay is swept by one or more of our horse
sweeps or by motor truck or tractor sweep.
WHAT THE PRESS BALES. —Any farm fodder can be baled—hay of all kinds, grass, meadow, wheaten,
oaten —loose or in sheaves, lucerne, sub-clover, sisal, flax, etc. It will bale any material suitable for baling.
Ideal for the Individual Grazier


AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY
Seventy years of specializing in the manufacture of Agricultural Machinery is the record of Jas. Smith Pty.
Ltd., of Ballarat, Victoria.
A constant study of the problems of the man on the land over this lengthy period has resulted in the
production of a range of equipment which is second to none.
Thoroughly up to date factory facilities have not only reduced production costs to a minimum but ensure
absolute standardisation of all components.
Any prospective purchaser for such lines as manufactured by Jas. Smith Pty. Ltd., owes it to himself to
inspect the many improved features built into these machines.
2A Travelling Chaffcutter
9lin. Mouth, with Single Screw Bagger. With 3 and 4 Knife Plain Wheel or 4
Knife Patent Wheel. With or without Self-Feeders.
The different parts of this plant such as the Elevator, Screw Bagger, etc., are NOT
driven off the Cutter Spindle, as in other makes, but off a strong separate steel shaft,
which drives every part and allows the Cutter
to do its own work only.
The riddle is strongly bound at the corners,
has improved drive, and is arranged so that
the sieve is easily changed. All elevators
have large steel spindles, which will never
wear out. The cavings are taken back to
the feed table. The Screw Bagger is not
built of wood, but is all metal; it is very
rigid and strong. The pressure on the bags
can be varied in a moment. Will take any
length of bag. The whole plant is built
under a thorough system; every part is
numbered for duplicating, and a complete
list sent with each machine.
Supplied complete ready for immediate use, and Shafts instead of pole can be supplied, when ordered.
Speed of Counter Shaft 330 Revolutions per minute. Capacity, H to 2 tons per hour. Horse Power
required, 8 h.p. (oil). Weight, 20 cwt. Shipping Dimensions. I2j tons. Also available:—

Smith’s Patent Knife Wheel
When large quantities of chaff are cut,
no time should be lost in sharpening.
The SMITH PATENT KNIFE WHEEL
is really the most efficient yet introduced.
All that is necessary is to loosen one nut
with one stroke of the spanner, take out
the knife; drop sharp one in; then tighten
with one stroke of the spanner.
The following reasons will show why this wheel should be used in preference to any other:—
Only one nut to loosen with one stroke of the spanner. Nothing to get out of place.
Impossible for knife to shift. No special care needed. No heavy holders or loose parts to
handle. No looking for numbers, loose parts, or where they go. No time taken to change
knife (compared with others). NO PROJECTIONS TO BEAT CHAFF INTO DUST.
For 12in. Mouth, only 4 Knife made. For 9jin. Mouth, only 3 Knife Made.
Handy Bagger
(Attached to Chaffcutter.)
These Baggers can be attached to size
of Chaffcutter; are a great labour saver,
besides giving convenience and saving
room.
No fixing when required and easily
attended to by a lad. Supplied ready for
use with belt and tamper as shown.
The good demand received for these
proves their usefulness. Bagger and all
parts for 2A, 4A Cutters.
Stationary Bagging Machine
(Screw Type.)
This is a very useful machine which cannot be dispensed with
where large quantities of chaff are being cut.
The Screw Bagger is built mainly of metal, simple in construc-
tion, is rigid and lasting and does not get out of order.
The Pressure in the bags can be varied in a moment and it will
take any length of bag.
Every part is numbered for duplicating and a complete list
sent with each machine, which is also supplied with loose pulley
and belt fork.

ELECTROLUX OPERATED REFRIGERATORS
Think for a moment what it means
to have all the conveniences and com-
forts of modern refrigeration pre-
viously available to only city homes.
An Electrolux Refrigerator prevents
food losses, simplifies food-buying,
- ensures food safety, makes lovely,
appetising dishes —but until you have
actually kept house with an Electrolux
Refrigerator at your elbow you can-
not realise what a wonderful differ-
ence it makes never to have to throw
away a pennyworth of food, never to
have tired-looking salads, runny but-
ter or suspicious milk—never a food
difficulty or doubt, whatever the
weather! The cost of operation, for
instance, is remarkably low: 4 gallons
of kerosene, on an average, will oper-
ate L3BO model for one month.
Again, the elimination of all mechan-
ism in the Electrolux reduces service
and maintenance charges, and more-
over gives the utmost reliability.
These are important considerations to
those living at some distance from
large country centres. Ask any Elec-
trolux users what they think of their
refrigerators and you will inevitably
come to the conclusion that from the
points of view of safe, trouble-free
refrigeration, health, economy and
comfort, an Electrolux Refrigerator is
an ideal investment for YOUR home.

ICE MAKING: 4 drawers producing a total of slbs. of ice per freezing, in cube or block form.
FUEL CONSUMPTION; Approximately pints of kerosene per day.
“THERE IS ONLY ONE ELECTROLUX”


No matter where you may live, the
Electrolux will bring you the most
modern method of refrigeration.
Ordinary air cools it, no water tank
or other cooling system being
required, and all moving parts have
been entirely eliminated in this world-
famous refrigerator. A tiny flame—
"the flame that freezes”—that is all,
and the result is a simple CON-
TINUOUS freezing process and the
circulation of a clean, cold dry air
that keeps all foodstuffs in the cabinet
fresh and wholesome. Apart alto-
gether from its attractive appearance,
the efficient trouble-free performance
of Electrolux has been proved under
the most extreme climatic conditions
throughout Australia, New Guinea
and the Pacific Islands. The Elec-
trolux Refrigerator has no motor, no
valves or any other moving parts to
wear out. It will never interfere with
radio reception. Because it has no
pipes or wire connections, it may be
installed, moved from room to room
or from home to home -without the
need of expert assistance. Every
Electrolux undergoes a most exacting
laboratory test and also a final inspec-
tion test which ensures that each indi-
vidual Refrigerator leaving the Com-
pany’s large modern factory is ready
for use and perfect in every detail.
