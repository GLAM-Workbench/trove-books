i —i In Prison, cm
Her tears may rust a slavish chain,
Around Australia’s soul,
Unless you rise up in ydur might,
And free her from control.
F. A. Holland. 266 Brunswick
TO THE WOMEIS OF AUSTRALIA.
Can ye enjoy this lovely scene,
And laugh and dance with glee,
While the best and brightest of them all
Pines in captivity.
Can ye enjoy the fragrant air
And walk beneath the stars,
Whilst brave and true Adela weeps
Behind the prison bars.
It was for ye she fought the fight,
It was for ye she fell,
She spoke and wrote for truth and right,
And got a prison cell,
Ah yes, indeed, she loved ye much,
Pale children of the poor,
To right your wrong against the strong
All ills she would endure
O, how she would enjoy once more
This lovely sight to see —
The fragrant flowers, the shady trees,
The river flowing free.
The thousands gathered on its banks,
With speech and action free
As was before the tyrant’s heel,
Crushed out our liberty.
Adela. loved and lonely one,
Must wear tbe gyves and why,
Because she would not cringe to power,
She would not stoop to lie.
We cannot rest beneath the trees,
Nor by the river shore,
Till Adela, our Adela,
Shall weep in chains no more.
Till she can rove beneath the moon
And watch the twinkling stars
And weep no more in solitude
Behind the prison bars.
