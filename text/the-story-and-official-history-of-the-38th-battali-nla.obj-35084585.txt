Dedicated
our Fallen, who gave their all
the service of their Country .
When the sunset has burnt out its flare in the west
For the footsteps of sweet, dusky Night,
There’s an angel who bends over Mother Earth’s breast
Where his little cross stands lone and white.
And the gay poppies laugh at the touch of her brush
Which was dipped in the sunset so red,
And is swept o’er the sky when the stars are a’hush
For blue cornflowers asleep on his bed.
When Morning awakes with a broad, sunny smile,
The angel goes back to the saints
Who gathered Dawn’s gold as she lingered awhile
Near the flower-covered graves, which she paints.

: Foreword:
T"T/*T gives me very great pleasure, indeed, to write
Vjl the foreword to the History of the 38th Battalion.
The hearts of the people of Bendigo and District
will surely be stirred when they read again of the
glorious deeds of their own boys at Messines, Ypres,
Passchendaele, and Amiens. The world has rung time
and time again during the long years of war with the
deeds of the A.1.F., and we, as Australians, have been
proud to call them brothers. But it is especially gratifying
for the people of Bendigo to know that their sons were
present and distinguished themselves in those great
battles, the memory of which will endure as long as
time itself:
.The darkest days of our apparent defeat were
brightened by their glorious deeds of valour. In the
stopping of the enemy before Amiens, perhaps the most
decisive period of the war, these 38th Battalion boys
played a great part, and later, in that victorious onslaught
on the Hindenburg line which swept the enemy’s
hordes before them, they were ever in the forefront.
Every Bendigo man should read this book.and tell
the glorious story to his children and their children's
children. This history of the deathless deeds of the boys
of the 38th Battalion should become like household
words, familiar in the mouths of all who love Australia,
and look to Bendigo and district as their home.
We are proud that they are Australians. We
are particularly proud that so many are Bendigonians.
Uf'h 7-
Prime Minister of Australia.

The History
of the
j 38th Battalion, A.I.F. i
ub :: Chapter 1. Creating a Fighting Force. :: l sJf
The birthplace of the Thirty-eighth Battalion was in the
Australian bush, three miles north-east of the City of Bendigo in
the State of Victoria, where white tents stood out against a back-
ground of gumtrees from whose branches the kookaburra sounded
a joyous reveille at the first streak of dawn, and the mopoke
solemnly sounded the “Last Post” ’neath a jewel studded sky.
The training ground selected by the military authorities was
an ideal one, for it embraced the Epsom Racecourse, a green
carpet laid down amid summer-brown fields.
Among the shady gums, where the kookaburras lived, men
hopped in and out of trenches, and cut such strange capers that
the wise-looking old birds were wont to give expression to their
feelings in occasional bursts of laughter.
And so, amid their own beloved bush, the men who had
banded together in the cause of Freedom and Justice gathered
new strength to face the hardships which they well knew the
near future must bring.
The Battalion was formed on the first day of March, 1916,
as one of the units of the Tenth Brigade, 3rd Division; Lieut.-Col.
C. H. Davis being appointed to command.
On this day 201 other ranks were taken on strength as a
nucleus. The work of forming a nucleus or a foundation upon
which to build the Battalion, was very successfully carried out
by Capt. L. L. Smith.
Training on the lines laid down by Administrative Head-
quarters was actively carried on, and with the addition of fresh
drafts the Unit soon afterwards reached War Establishment.
Despite the fact that most of the N.C.O.’s selected to instruct
raw recruits were, unfortunately, withdrawn to schools, the task
of moulding the men proceeded in a satisfactory manner, and in
a few short weeks the C.O. could well feel proud of the men who
“sloped arms’’ and marched with that easy grace only to be
found in the movements of the well-trained soldier.
The days passed by very happily.
Bendigo held many attractions, for the citizens entertained
men on leave with lavish hospitality. Many a soldier, a stranger
to the Golden City, soon discovered true friends who made their
house his home, and did all in their power to brighten the hours
of leave. The ever-open doors of the Y.M.C.A. welcomed him,
and on Sunday evenings this splendid Association invited him to
gather round the appetising tea tables where the ladies of Ben-
digo presided and made him feel so thoroughly at home.


With the month of May came a disquieting interruption
when a severe outbreak of cerebro-spinal meningitis was respon-
sible for interfering with the work of training. All sorts of
expedients were tried to arrest the persistent progress of the
epidemic, until finally the whole Battalion was subjected to
severe medical examination, and all those found thoroughly
healthy were removed to Campbellfield on June sth. These
measures proving effective the training went on uninterruptedly
and strength was made up with fresh drafts.
On 14th of June a most impressive ceremonial parade took
place, and in the presence of a large number of friends and
visitors, the King’s and Regimental colors were presented, on
behalf of the Citizens of Bendigo, by the Governor-General, Sir
Ronald Munro Ferguson, K.C.M.G. The Battalion was drawn
up in line, the colors cased, being in rear of the centre in charge
of two Color-Sergeants. The Battalion then formed three sides
of a square and drums were piled in the centre. The colors were
consecrated by the Chaplain and the Commanding-Officer
(Lieut.-Col. C. H. Davis) then handed the King’s color to His
Excellency the Governor-General, who presented it to the Senior
Lieutenant, Lieut. F. E. Fairweather, who received it, sinking
on the right knee.
The Second in Command, Major R. O. Henderson, then
handed the Regimental Color to His Excellency and the
Second Senior Lieutenant (Lieut. J. H. Moore) received it as
above mentioned.
The Lieutenants then arose and the Governor-General
addressed the Battalion ere the Colors were given a general
salute.
Six days later the Battalion, the Tenth Field Engineers,
and Tenth Field Ambulance bade farewell to Australia’s sunny
shores.
Tuesday, the 20th of June, 1916, will never -oe forgotten by
those who sailed away, or by their relatives and friends who
crowded the Port Melbourne pier to bid them a speedy and safe
return. No. 54, H.M.A.T. Runic was draped with khaki, for the
men swarmed up into the rigging, and occupied every vantage
point of the vessel. From the pier hundreds of reels of colored
paper ribbon were thrown aboard, and soon a wonderful network
of color screened the drab hull of the Runic. Thousands of
gay flags, scarfs and handkerchiefs gladdened a scene which
could so easily have been a sad one.
When the transport moved slowly out from the pier it
seemed that the fragile streamers reluctantly let the great liner
go forth upon its danger-fraught way.
Snap! Snap!! Snap!! The straining ribbons parted, and
floated like colored seaweed on the blue waters of the Bay.
Lovers wound them in, dripping and soiled, and tucked them
away in peggy bags or tunic pockets. Parents, wives and
sweethearts waved a last farewell, and eyes bravely smiled
through a mist of tears, and strained to catch a last glimpse of
a loved one until the vessel became a blurred mass of frantically
'waving figures.


And thus passed the S.S. Runic out to the blue Southern
Ocean.
The following were the officers who embarked with the
Unit:

Capetown, South Africa, was the first port of call, and the
three weeks’ voyage to the Cape was uneventful.
Life aboard a troopship can be very monotonous, but
energetic people aboard the Runic constantly broke the
monotony by arranging capital sports programmes and concerts
which were so thoroughly enjoyed by all, and which helped to
keep one physically fit and cheerful.
Except for a slight outbreak of measles and meningitis the
health of the troops was .good. Two deaths resulted from these
diseases, which were quickly defeated by the 10th Field Ambu-
lance. This Unit did a splendid work throughout the voyage
to England.
Everybody was in fine spirits on the day that land was
sighted; and when on entering Table Bay the world-famed moun-
tain stood out in all its rugged grandeur, excitement ran high.
Five days were spent at the Cape, during which time liberal
leave was granted when the beauties of Camps Bay, Sea Point, the
Lion’s Head and many other delightful places were explored
One of the finest motor trips in the world may be made at
the Cape. A circular road runs around Table Mountain for over
thirty miles. Leaving Capetown it winds its way for twelve
miles along the sea coast at the foot of the Twelve Apostles
(huge fantastic peaks which tower up into the heavens) and dips
up and down along the rugged shore, where the league-long
rollers dash against massive rocks, and fling white showers of
spray to the sunshine.
Suddenly the road turns inland, and runs through Arcadian
forests of oak and silver-leaf trees, and finally winds its way
hack to Capetown through the pine forests of Wynberg Those
who were fortunate enough to make this trip will never forget
its wonderful variety of scenery, the wild grandeur of shores


and mountains; the soft beauty of Arcadian-like avenues; the
magnificent forests of pines, and. towering above all this loveli-
ness the eternal mountain, and the tablecloth of clouds hanging
over its fiat summit.
On the second day of the stay at Capetown the Battalion
marched through the.town and out to the Cecil Rhodes monu-
ment. Passing through a native village thousands of dusky
men, children and women showed great interest in the march,
especially the children who straightway started a begging
campaign for “tickeys,” or threepenny bits.
On arrival at the monument, the Battalion was invited to
lunch by the ladies of Capetown. This instance of kind hospi-
tality was one of many which the Unit received during the stay
at the Cape.
A fine body of native troops put in an appearance on the
Capetown wharf ere the Runic sailed. These men were
Jamaicans, and had just cleaned up the Germans in West Africa.
They were huge, thick-set men. and wore their uniforms with
an air of pride. They seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the
game of war, spoke optimistically of the fighting that awaited
them in East Africa, and hoped to see France at an early date.
On leaving the Cape rough weather was experienced for
forty-eight hours, but the days that followed were calm and
sunny. The nights were particularly enjoyable; the Southern
Cross gleamed like a diamond pendant in the tropic sky, and the
calm ocean glowed with phosphorus through which the vessel cut
a pathway of fire.
Boat drill now became a daily event.
The decks would present a peac'eful scene, men reading,
playing games and lolling about in the warm sunshine. Then
quite unexpected the practise submarine alarm would sound
when everyone would snatch up life-belts and hasten to their
posts.
It one day happened that the sailors accidentally dropped
some heavy tackle across the syren lanyard, which caused the
genuine submarine alarm (a long blast of the syren) to disturb
the peace. Great excitement prevailed, but everyone took up
their positions in a cool and orderly manner, and laughingly dis-
persed when it was discovered that the alarm was the result
of an accident.
The days now grew unpleasantly hot, for King Neptune’s
coral palace was not far away, and on a wireless message arriv-
ing from His Submarine Majesty every arrangement was made
to receive him, and to present a number of officers and men to
the venerable monarch. A large canvas bath was rigged up on
the main deck, and was eyed with mingled feelings.
A fanfare of trumpets finally announced the arrival of King
Neptune and his Court.
A long tow beard gave the aged monarch a fatherly appear-
ance, and a cardboard crown encircled a brow from which war
failed to drive away a look of serenity. His charming daughter
was the cynosure of all eyes. What soldier ever failed to admire
a pretty girl? And this lovely maid had the blue of the ocean in


her eyes; her wealth of toAv tresses gleamed in the hot sunshine;
Avhile her every movement Avas the personification of regal
beauty.
Dark-skinned police now commenced to arrest officers and
m«n and drag them before a court of justice over which Father
Neptune presided. The victims were awarded tasteful soap
pills, and their faces lathered Avith paste which a large wooden
razor partly removed ere they Avere dipped back into the briny
bath and thoroughly washed by attendants. The fact that
one might be faultlessly attired in tussore silk garments did not
prevent him escaping the ordeal, as several people discovered.
Shortly after the royal visit warm tropical rains drifted
across the ocean, and the air became heavy and oppressive.
Life ’tAveen decks was unbearable, and on deck the incessant
rain made things very uncomfortable.
St. Vincent, Cape Verde Islands, was reached on 2nd August.
Excepting the novelty of once again beholding land the half day’s
stay did not prove a very interesting time, for leave ashore
could not be granted on account of the unhealthy climate.
Viewed from the Runic the tOAvn of St. Vincent appeared to be
fairly large; fine buildings and residences peeped through the
palms which graced the rocky shore. The scattered islands
could hardly be called picturesque, although patches of tropical
vegetation softened their rugged features. Native canoes
swarmed about the troopship and watching the dusky islanders
diving for pennies proved amusing entertainment.
After leaving the tropics the weather greAv congenial.
The last three days of the long voyage Avere flavored with a cer-
tain amount of excitement. The torpedo-boat destroyers which
were to escort the Runic through the sub-marine-infected Avaters
failed to put in an appearance. It was an anxious time for
Captain Kearney, the ship’s commander. The nights Avere moon-
light, favoring submarine operations, and for forty-eight hours
the Captain kept .to the bridge, ready for any emergency.
England Avas sighted on the morning of the 10th August,
and shortly after midday the Runic entered Devonport.
The Battalion disembarked at Plymouth at 2 p.m., and en-
trained for Lark Hill Camp, Salisbury Plains.
After long weeks at sea, the glorious Devon country delight-
ed the eye. Summer in all her glory reigned in woods and
fields. Cornfields stood out like blocks of gold against the green
pasture lands where sheep and cattle peacefully browsed in
the scented sunshine. League upon league of smiling coun-
try unfolded to the swift train, and its beauty was applauded by
sea-weary men. At Exeter the Battalion was heartily welcomed
by the citizens who crowded the railway platform, and served
refreshments and cigarettes. This warm welcome to England
was greatly appreciated by all, and rousing cheers Avere given
for the good folk of Exeter when the train journey was re-
sumed. Lark Hill was reached at midnight.
Next morning, the Battalion’s new home was viewed with
great interest. Thousands of huts dotted the undulating coun-
try for miles around. The picturesque village of Amesburv
nestled in a green hollow below the camp, and its old ivy-covered


church and quaint gabled houses seemed to slumber to the*
droning of the bees in the flOAver-filled gardens. The village be-
came a popular place of recreation, for entertainment was pro-
vided at a large Y.M.C.A. hut, and at a cinema.
The camp accommodation Avas good, hot and cold shower
baths, ablution huts, and conveniences for washing clothes
making conditions reasonably comfortable.
Lark Hill Camp Avas a soldier’s city. Canteens and privately
OA\-ned shops displayed a wonderful variety of goods, and
restaurants presented appetising bills of fare.
Stonehenge, the haunt of the ancient Druids, was close at
hand, and an interesting feature of the training grounds was
this old-time place of strange worship, Avhere the massive crom-
lechs stood grimly silent; and the tumuli, huge elongated mounds,
or graves, dotted the country for miles around, a,fid provided
excellent cover for practise field operations.
Scarcely had the Battalion settled down to the new life in
England when four days’ disembarkation lea A re Avas granted.
London attracted the majority, and the time spent in the great
city was thoroughly enjoyed. Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s
Cathedral, Parliament Houses, the Tower, and many places of
historical interest Avere visited.
On returning to camp the Unit settled down to three months
of solid training. Leave from camp was granted on Saturday and
Sunday afternoons when delightful walks ware taken through
quaint villages, shady avenues of oaks and elms, and on beds
of bracken in the deeper shade of the Avoods men relaxed after a
hard week’s work and listened to the songs of the thrush.
After the Battalion had been vigorously training for about
five weeks, H.M. the King desired to inspect the whole of the
Third Division.
The"review took place at Bulford Field, three miles distant
from Lark Hill, where this Unit met the other Battalions of the
Division and details of A.I.F. Units from various camp s in the
neighborhood and a detachment of New Zealand troops. The
weather was inclined to be chilly, and while awaiting the arrival
of His Majesty the men were invited to join in games and ath-
letic contests.
When King George rode into Bulford Field the Division had
been formed up in Battalions in line. Massed bands played the
Royal Salute, and, as the Division presented arms thousands of
bayonets flashed in the air, a long line of steel which stretched
across-the field until the bayonets in the distance looked like
fine needles. When the Division had been inspected the Bat-
talions marched past His Majesty in column of companies to
the stirring strains of the massed bands.
Lieut.-Colonel C. H. Davis, of this Unit, with other Bat-
talion commanders was afterwards presented to the King.
Everyone was in high spirits, and when at last His
Majesty took his departure hats were placed on bayonets, and he
was loudly cheered. In the month of October the Battalion had
its first experience of trench life.


Leaving Lark Hill in daylight the Tenth Brigade (37th,
38th, 39th, 40th Battalions) marched to the Bustard Trenches,
six miles out of camp, and experienced the unpleasant conditions
of winter warfare. Rain swept the open country and poured
into the white-chalk trenches. When at night several companies
entered the trenches ‘to take up their positions, men floundered
through pools of whitewash, and got covered with sticky white
mud. Yerey lights went hissing up through the driving rain, to
illuminate a dreary landscape. Rifles cracked, and the dull de-
tonations of hand grenades momentarily drowned the angry
hissing of the rain. Here and there feeble attempts had been
made to build dug-outs, but these excavations were small, and
afforded but poor protection from the weather. Men huddled
up in their sodden overcoats and settled down to the long, dreary
hours of darkness.
When morning broke, cold and cheerless, a hot breakfast
arrived, and unhappy looking faces brightened considerably.
The Companies were relieved shortly afterwards and re-
tired to billets where the miseries of the night were soon for-
gotten in sleep. The next three days were finer, although cold
showers occasionally made things unpleasant; and everyone was
glad when the time came to return to camp.
CHAPTER lI.—FRANCE.
In November. 1916, the Division was considered fit for ser-
vice in France, and embarkation was commenced, this Unit em-
barking at Southampton on the afternoon of November 22. The
embarkation of a fully-equipped Battalion is no small undertak-
ing; horses, waggons, general supplies, and a thousand odds and
ends have to be dealt with. Great satisfaction was, therefore,
expressed by all concerned at this gigantic task being accom-
plished without a hitch.
The Channel was crossed during the hours of darkness,
and the old French port of Le Havre was reached in the earlv
hours of the morning, the Unit landing shortly after daylight.
After five months’ absence from Australia the Thirty-eighth
Battalion set foot upon the soil of France, where for two long
years it was to face the bitter hardships of war.
The march through Le Havre proved interesting. Hundreds
of women and children besieged the long khaki column, and did
a brisk trade in fruit, chocolate and various confections.
The first attempt to “parley” with the French folk was truly
amusing. But the novelty of the surroundings soon wore off as
the weight of each man’s gear began to tell upon his buoyant
spirits.
This march to No. 2 Rest Camp was one of the hardest the
Battalion ever had in France, although the distance was not
great. The abnormal burden of pack, rifle, ammunition, blankets,
etc., tested one’s strength to the utmost, and a long, tortuous!


uphill road which led to the camp seemed to add a hundred
pounds weight to the already overburdened men, who were
thoroughly exhausted on reaching the summit.
After a good dinner and afternoon’s rest spirits revived, and
next morning everybody looked fit for the march to the railway,
where the Battalion was to entrain for the Front. This march
proved much easier, for it was mostly downhill going.
At the railway everybody was busily employed loading the
troop train, and it was growing dark ere the long line of car-
riages and trucks pulled out of Le Havre en route to Bailleul.
The journey proved a very tedious one.
For forty hours the train crawled along like a snail. The
weather was cold, and to warm themselves the men often walked
beside the train.
A story is related of one man, who, on alighting from the
crawling train, said that he was going to gather some wayside
flowers to send home to Australia. “But you won’t find any
flowers at this time of the year,” said a comrade. “That’s alright,
I’ve got a packet of seed in my pocket,” came the reply.
At Abbeville the train halted for a rest and went to sleep.
About fifty of its passengers got out and went for a walk in
search of hot coffee. But during their absence the train woke up
and decided to shuffle along for a few more miles; and so they
were left behind to await the next train going somewhere in the
direction of the front.
Bailleul was reached at three o’clock on the morning of the
26th, when tired, cramped men awakened from fitful slumber to
hear for the first time the dull booming of the guns of the West-
ern Front, and see strange, fantastic lights illuminating the sky
in the north.
To hear the guns of battle for the first time is a
be-forgotten experience; a strange feeling not of fear or nervous-
ness, but a sensation that is almost indefinable takes possession
of one.
Perhaps there is a certain amount of mental excitement.
One suddenly becomes curiously interested in those dull detona-
tions and strange lights, and for a while does some very deep
thinking.
It was a cheerless dawn which broke over the town of
Bailleul. Men unloading the train were wet to the skin by
driving showers of icy rain, and the raw air stung one’s face and
hands.
Fortunately, the rain ceased at daylight when motor buses
conveyed the Battalion to Strezaele, about three miles distant.
Here the Unit was billeted in farm buildings which were
scattered about the featureless country. Old ramshackle barns
proved havens of rest to the worn-out men who stretched out on
beds of clean straw, much to the disgust of the farm animals
which were turned out of their winter quarters to make room
for the intruders.


Two days were pleasantly passed at the old farm houses
before moving on to Armentieres. The French folk made every-
one thoroughly at home, and merry hours were spent before the
blazing fires of farmhouse kitchens, drinking steaming coffee,
sampling wines and struggling to learn the language of the
country, much to the amusement of the farming people.
The first aerial battle witnessed by the Battalion took place
at Strezaele, when two enemy scout ’planes were intercepted by
a pair of Allied aeroplanes.
For ten minutes the machines circled, dived and ducked,
and the rattle of their machine-guns was clearly heard. Finally
the Boche finding the game too hot made off in the direction of
the Front and managed to make their escape.
On the morning of the 28th November the Unit left Strezaele
and marched to Armentieres, a distance of about twenty kilo-
metres. Enemy aircraft interrupted the march for a short while
when a friendly hedge screened the long column from the scout
’planes on the look-out for artillery targets.
On nearing Armentieres barbed wire entanglements were
seen for the first time. When about to enter the town a warning
was received that the Pont de Nieppe causeway, which must be
crossed, was under enemy observation and shell fire. Orders
were given to don steel helmets, and the causeway was crossed
by companies at two minute intervals. The thought of being
under shell fire for the first time produced a mild feeling of ex-
citement; but the crossing proved quite a tame affair, and it was
not until six months afterwards that the causeway was shelled.
It was growing dusk when the town was entered. The march
had proved a tiring affair and everyone felt worn out. Armen-
tieres on first acquaintance did not look a cheerful place, for the
simple reason that the Battalion was introduced to it after night-
tall, when all lights in the houses and cafes were obscured by
heavy shutters on account of enemy bombing ’planes. At that
time one little dreamed that behind those shutters was many a
gay and homely scene, and that some of the happiest times ever
to be spent in France awaited the Battalion in the old town of
Armentieres.
A large factory in Barbed-Wire Square accommodated the
tired travellers, and here the next three days were spent in pre-
paration for the first trip into the trenches.
Equipment kits and gas masks were carefully inspected,
and every care taken that the men were provided with every-
thing necessary for their personal comfort and welfare. It is
seldom that one unit relieves another in broad daylight, but at
Armentieres reliefs were often carried out in the daytime, for
the communication trenches which led to the defences on the
outskirts of the town were screened by buildings, and could not
be observed by the enemy.
At 8 a.m. on December Ist the Battalion left billets to re-
lieve New Zealand troops in the left sub-sector, Houplines area,
and proceeded by half platoons to Little Mary Dump, and was
issued with gum-boots which were put on before entering the
communication trenches. These trenches were very deep and
narrow. Duckboards bridging the mud were broken in places,


and the result was that men often found themselves waist deep
in slimy mud, or sprawling full length into icy cold slush. Irish
Avenue was in a particularly vile condition, and the officers and
men of “C” and “D” Companies struggled along this narrow,
slimy passage through water up to their waists.
The subsidiary, support, and front-line trenches were
reached after an hour’s hard struggle through muddy walls
where men got jammed, soaked through to the skin with icy
water, and plastered with mud. The day was fairly quiet; odd
shells occasionally livened things up, and these explosions were
curiously watched. Dugouts afforded but a minimum amount of
shelter from the inclement weather, for water dripped through
their rusty iron roofs, and oozed through the mud walls. High
breastworks screened all movements from the enemy, and over
these solidly-built banks the men in the front line peered for the
first time into No Man’s Land. These breastworks were sub-
jected to Minenwerfer bombardments and had to be constantly
repaired. The distance across No Man’s Land varied from 80
to 200 yards. On the left of the sub-sector, and just within the
enemy ten-itory. was the shattered village of Freiingham. When-
ever a breach was made in the breastworks snipers hidden in the
ruins of Freiingham made things very lively for those who re-
paired the damaged bank.
A hundred yards in rear of the front line a dummy support
trench attracted considerable fire from the enemy, and was daily
battered by heavy trench mortars. The area between the subsi-
diary and front line trenches were pitted with deep “Minnie”
holes filled with muddy water. Living conditions were appalling.
Hands gathered mud from everything that was touched. For
ten days the Battalion held the sub-sector and wallowed in mud
day and night. It was really a quiet time, for weather condi-
tions prevented much being done in the way of warfare.
Two hot meals were served every day, and hot cocoa at
midnight. To guard against trench feet, socks were changed
daily, and feet well rubbed with whale oil.
Captain G. V. Lansell, a most capable and popular officer,
was wounded on 3rd December, 1916, and his wounds proving
serious and causing him to relinquish the game of war he was
invalided back to Australia.
Taking advantage of a favorable wind, gas was released
against the enemy trenches on December 4th, and drifted across
No Man’s Land in fleecy clouds. The enemy’s gas alarms
sounded for miles along his lines, but no results were afterwards
visable.
On the night of the 30th December the observers on Lewis
Gun posts in the trench occupied by “B” Company became sus-
picious that the barbed wire entanglements which protected the
tiench were being cut. An occasional click could be heard in
No Man’s Land, and presently a shadowy form was observed
moving cautiously about in the dark.
A Verey light was sent up to illuminate the neighborhood
under suspicion, and revealed a Boche rapidly seeking cover in a
shell hole. Shots were fired at him, and immediately enemy


trench mortars made things lively for “B” Company’s men. The
shells crashed about the trench for three very long minutes. A
Lewis Gun was put out of action and a bombing post was blown
in.
Directly the shelling ceased about twelve Boche rushed the
parapet and bombed the trench, but cool and determined men
quickly drove them off with rifle fire into the blackness of No
Man’s Land. Second-Lieut. K. G. Emmonson, Trench Officer, and
three other ranks were wounded whilst pluckily defending their
position and routing the enemy.
The plucky Lieutenant was awarded the first Military Cross
won in the Division, and Private J. J. Meyerink was awarded the
Military Medal for bravely mounting the parapet and struggling
to work a damaged machine gun.
The Unit was relieved by the Fortieth Battalion on the
evening of the 10th December, and retired to billets in Armen-
tieres.
After the miseries of the trenches, what palaces were the
warm, brightly-lit cafes. Here was laughter, gaiety and the
sparkle of bright eyes, and as charming Mimi served glasses of
coffee, and blue spirals of cigarette smoke floated up to the
ceiling, the mud and discomforts of the past ten days were com-
pletely forgotten.
It was hard to realise that Armentieres was so close to the
firing line, and that at any moment enemy guns could pour salvo
after salvo of screaming shells into the shops and factories
where the civilians calmly went about their business, and seemed
to be quite indifferent to any danger. And out in the fields
farming operations were carried on even to within a mile of the
line. Shells might drone overhead, but M. le Fermier and his
horses continued to turn over the soil.
Half-past Eleven Square was a popular rendezvous, and
here the events of the day or the latest news from Australia
would be discussed. A neighboring tower had been hit by a
shell, and the old clock which stared down into the square had
stopped at eleven-thirty when the shell had smashed into the
tower, and so the place had been given this strange name.
Civilians and soldiers rubbed shoulders in the Rue de Lille
and Rue Sadi Carnot. Shop windows displayed attractive goods
in the daytime, but at night business was carried on behind
heavy shutters and closed doors.
A soldier’s life in Armentieres was a strange mixture of
events. It was not all rest and pleasure. Fatigue parties worked
day and night shifts carrying ammunition, gas cylinders, etc., up
to the trenches.
One night Private “Digger” would be floundering along in
the mud, cursing the heavy gas cylinders, and listening to the
sickening crunch of an exploding “Minnie” which seemed to
shake the ground from under him.
On the following night he would be comfortably seated be-
fore a blazing fire with fair Marie correcting his French, and
Grandmere nodding over her knitting. Could you have peeped


in through the heavily-shuttered window you would have thought
that he could not have looked more thoroughly at home had he
been sitting at his own fireside in far-aw T ay Australia.
Armentieres has well been called the “Nursery of the Third
Division.” Walk into almost any French home at night aud
there you would find an Australian soldier.
Firm friendships were formed with the large-hearted town-
people, and many men of the Third Division will often look back
with pleasure to the days of Armenfieres.
On the 16th of December the Battalion again went into the
trenches, spent five more days in the mud and rain, and then
retired to billets in Houplines.
On Christmas Eve, under cover of daTkness, men groped
their way about in the open spaces in search of greenery to de-
corate their billets.
Next morning the rooms of many a shell-shocked house
were brightly decorated with greenery, and Christmas greetings
were chalked on the walls. Happy little companies sat down at
midday to roast beef and plum pudding, and for awhile forgot all
about the war. Lieut.-General Godley, Corps Commander, paid
the Battalion a visit, and in a bright little speech said he hoped
that the next Christmas dinner would be eaten in Australia.
But two more Christmas Days were yet to be spent in
France.
At one o’clock on New Year’s morning simultaneous raids
were made along the whole Divisional front. The 3Sth Battalion
had four raiding parties out, none of which, owing to uncut wire
and detection by the Boche, effected an entry. The parties con-
sisting of from 12 to IS men apiece were commanded respectively
by Dieut. Peters and Second-Lieutenant Spark on the right, and
Second-Lieutenant Herring and Second-Lieutenant Pooley on the
left. The latter party’s attempt was made opposite a notorious
point in the enemy trenches known as Raid Ditch. While the
leading men were cutting the wire the party was caught in the
bright beam of one of the enemy’s searchlights constantly in use
on this front. A withering fire from rifles and machine guns
was immediately concentrated on the unlucky party—which,,
owing to the intensity of the fire was compelled to take whatever
cover was available. In addition, the Boche freely hurled
bombs and hand grenades into their midst. Heavy casualties
resulted at once, those killed including Second-Lieut. Pooley,
Sgt. W. L. Rowe (now Lieut.) thereupon took charge, with Cor-
poral H. F. Poole (now Lieut.) as second in command. On the
fire slackening somewhat they ascertained those who were alive,
and later on led the survivors back to our lines.
Even the cover provided by the surrounding shell holes was
insufficient to protect the few survivors from being hit, and the
slightest raising of the body spelt death.
The Germans kept up their continuous fire for about half an
houi, the whole of which time Sergeant Rowe and his comrades
suffered an ordeal few others have experienced.


It was not until nearly 4 a.m. that the watchers in our
trenches, by now almost devoid of hope, saw several figures
silhouetted on our parapet, and one by one Sgt. Rowe and four
others dropped into our trenches, utterly worn out and exhausted
after their terrible experience. They were met by Major Hurry,
who throughout the long hours had maintained a constant vigil.
At daylight one more survivor, Pte. Lockett, returned —a total
of six out of the eighteen who went over.
For this and other fine work Sgt. Rowe and Cpl. Poole
were shortly afterwards promoted to commissioned rank.
On the following night Lieut. Peters led a relief party into
No Man’s Land to look for the missing men. Despite the
searchlights and machine gun fire, a methodical search was
made, and ha and L.-Cpl. F. J. Perry (who was later in the year
awarded the D.C.IVI. for conspicuous work as a Scout) located
and brought back one of the ill-fated party who had been wound-
ed, and though in a state of exhaustion through exposure was
crawling towards our trenches.
For this and his good work on the. previous night Lieut.
Peters was awarded the M.C.
On the 13th January the whole front was heavily bombarded
by the enemy. Minnenwerfer, high explosive and shrapnel being
freely used.
Great damage was done to the trenches. Cambridge Avenue
—a communication trench —was badly battered. The Battalion
suffered several casualties, four other ranks being killed and
seven put out of action through wounds and shell-shock. On
the following day the Unit once again returned to billets, but
not for a time of rest. Irish Avenue was in such a fearful con-
dition owing to the weather that it was decided to dig another
communication trench leading through to the front line. This
work was done at night-time by a large working party of two
hundred men who experienced some very lively times. Enemy
searchlights occasionally swept the area, and showed up the
large body of men struggling to dig down into the sticky ground
and thus secure shelter from the machine gun bullets which
whizzed through the night, and “plopped” into the mud. On the
night of the 16th January 2nd-Lieut. Thompson (who had just
received his commission) and Corporal Henry were killed by
machine gun fire, and several men were wounded.
Those early days, while the Division was still untried; when
all were as soldiers very young, none could deny everyone’s
keenness and eagerness to “get on with the war,” and to “kill
the Boche,” “The Raiding Days” were as school days, the minor
operation, a school for the “Magnus Opus,” for a. raid carried out
with thoroughness was, indeed, the miniature of a battle.
Raiding trained officers in the marvellous amount of correct
detail necessary in a fighting force; trained them, too, in leader-
ship; taught everyone to regard an artillery barrage as a good
friend, and how near that friend one could move unharmed;
taught all to adhere to organisation and plans in the most trying
circumstances, and, most of all, it revealed the Australian’s
superiority over the Boche.


But the raids served military purposes other than as schools
—for clean steel was dipped in enemy blood. The raiders’
activities fatigued and demoralised the enemy, and after every
raid they knew his strength was minus many casualties, and his
morale lower. Knew, too, that these raiding activities tied
down on the northern front regiments of the enemy which would
otherwise have gone south, to be thrown against Australian
Divisions then fighting against great odds on the terrible Somme
battlefields. Yes, the lads of “The Eggs-a-Cook” thought often
of the older sister divisions and wished to be with them, but
that not being possible helped all they could, and that by raiding.
Less than three weeks after first entering the trenches “raids”
were whispered of; then choice parties of men and a few officers
passed from the Battalion and entered upon special training at
the shell-torn Ecole Professionale in Armentieres. Efforts were
made at secrecy, but all camouflage failed and added only an air
of romance to the enterprises.
It may not be said that crowds rushed to volunteer for the
raids, but always there were sufficient volunteers, and always
men disappointed at being overlooked or omitted when any raid-
ing party was made up.
But it can be said that always the choicest, cheeriest
spirits, always the pick, found their way into the raiding parties.
What called them.? Why was it that these men would at
all times be willing to exchange the comparative safety of trench
defence to take the unequal risk of a small party of bold men,
matched against seemingly every German, every machine gun,
every minenwerfer, rifle and field gun adjacent to the raided
locality? Was it that they wished to gain in warlike experience,
or hungered for war trophies; or, perhaps, desired to appear (as
they did) amongst their comrades as super-soldiers? It might
have been any of these, but it is doubtful.
Rather, one thinks, ’twas the old lure of Romance, that
twain Mystery and Adventure, which lured our pioneers, hardiest
sons of a. hardy nation, to our own Southern Land, that now sent
their descendants “over the top” raiding. Mystery, born of the
night, when the perilous reconnaissance of No Man’s Land was
made, and the scouts stealthily crawling along the enemy en-
tanglements heard the movements of the foe, the handling of
aims, footsteps on duckboards, his speech and even his songs as
some incautious sentry cheered his lonely vigil
And Mystery of Mysteries when, on the night before the raid
the enemy entanglements smashed by trench mortars had to be
examined, and a gap proved before the raid could be launched-
when with caution, mud and slime from head to foot, the scouts’
silent as shadows and almost as elusive, elbowed, crawled and
sidled their way through “the gap,” and close to the enemy
parapet. •
, tv ,°V h l 2 s h Janual ’y a raiding party drawn from all Units
t the Tenth Brigade gave the Boche a lively time, bombing his
dugouts and killing and wounding a number of men.
, Vf. first prisoner captured by the Third Division was
bi ought m by the elated men of the Thirty-ninth Battalion.


Next morning two companies of the 38th Battalion and two
of the 37th Battalion forming a unit of 800 strong, under Lieut.-
Col. Uavis, retired to billets at Erquinghem Baths, for special
training as a raiding Battalion. The remainder of the two Bat-
talions, under Major R. O. Henderson, was known as X Bat-
talion. This unit was in and out of the trenches in Bois
Grenier sector while the raiders were training at Erquinghem,
and it experienced some very rough times. Two officers, 2nd-
Lieut. Thomas and 2nd-Lieut. Watson were killed in action on
Ist and 23rd February respectively.
The days with the raiding battalion were busy ones. The
weather was bitterly cold, but the work of training kept the
blood freely circulating, and this meant warm bodies. Flooded
fields had frozen, and many hours were spent skating on the
slippery ice. Everyone was new at the game, casualties occur-
red; heads, arms and legs being broken, until at last orders pro-
hibited this enjoyable but risky sport.
From an aerial photograph of enemy trenches to be raided
a trench system was marked out so that everyone should be
familiar with it. But when it came to digging the frozen ground
picks and shovels burred, and after several days of hard work
the trenches were only six inches deep, and the job was given
up as a hopeless one.
These days of training were enjoyed by all, despite the
bitterness of the weather. France was experiencing the cold-
est winter of thirty years; rivers and canals were frozen feet
deep. >
Wash a handkerchief in boiling water, then wave it in the
air for a few seconds, and, lo and behold! your fingers grasped a
stiff, frozen piece of linen. Men usually drank their tea directly
it was served, for if left in a mess tin for a few minutes it would
bcome a lump of brown ice.
On one occasion two men decided to have some jelly with
their evening meal. A packet of jelly crystals had arrived in a
parcel sent from Australia. So boiling water was procured, and
a mess tin full of pink jelly was quickly made. Tea not yet
being ready, the mess tin was put aside. Later on. when the two
friends sat down to enjoy their jelly they found that it had
frozen. The hard pink lump was knocked out of the tin, and
cracked up into pieces with an entrenching tool.
No intelligence regarding the date of the raid was forth-
coming. On the night of the 24th (known as W night) the
Raiding Battalion marched out from billets to all appearances
bound for the trenches, but after being away for two hours re-
turned to Erquinghem. This trip was made to deceive spies in
the neighborhood who were, no doubt, keeping a sharp eye on
the movements of the raiders, and had means of communication
with the enemy. A heavy barrage was put down on the enemy
trenches, and, from information afterwards received the Boche
expected it would be followed by an infantry attack.
However, when the barrage ceased he was left in peace to
ponder over matters.
On X night, the 25th, the Battalion again left billets, and
again returned without paying a visit to the front line. Another
barrage swept the enemy trenches.


On Y night the raiders kept to their billets, and the enemy
was not disturbed by the artillery. But on Z night, the 27th
January, the raiders left billets and marched about two and a
half miles out of Erquinghem and were picked up by motor
lorries and conveyed to Armentieres, where they disappeared
into the communication trenches.
At 10 p.m., while the Raiders were proceeding from the
motor lorries to the trenches, a preliminary short, but intense,
artillery shoot took place. This diversion lasted for 20 minutes,
the area to be raided at 12.30 being heavily bombarded by our
18 pounders and 4.5 in Hows. This undoubtedly enabled the
Raiders to effect a surprise at 2.30 a.ln.
The comparative quietness of our guns between 10.20 and
zero hour apparently convinced the Boche he had received his
“full issue” for that night.
At midnight six hundred and fifty raiders, with blackened
faces, noiselessly left the safe cover of the friendly trenches,
crawled out over the parapet, through our own scanty wire to
lay up cold and still and silent, awaiting zero hour. While
lying there unseen, bullets from enemy machine guns crashed
and whistled above them; rockets soared and burst in dazzling
radiance, and beams from enemy searchlights swept No Man’s
Land.
Twelve-thirty, which was zero hour, brought on hurricane
wings the barrage when our batteries with splendid synchroni-
zation and marvellous accuracy sent a tornado of high explosive
and shrapnel on the enemy front line, killing, wounding and
demoralising the enemy watchers; while those in dugouts were
prevented from leaving them.
All this while the raiders rapidly approached their objec-
tive. Never will that moment be forgotten. No Man’s Land
lit by the panic rockets of the enemy, red, white, green and
yellow, and luminous with the flash of bursting shell; ears filled
with the smash and crash of the barrage, and nostrils with the
intoxicating smell of burnt powder. There, spread over a front
of half a mile, were running figures, the raiders, six hundred
and fifty of them, showing black in the glare as they ran to-
ward the German trenches, some with little weight, and some
burdened with mats and bridges to overcome enemy obstacles
and charges to demolish dugouts: everyone and everything ac-
cording to plan. The first check was “The Willow Ditch.” °The
scouts had measured it. and here a light bridge was rushed into
place and almost no seconds were lost, The raiders streamed
thiough the gaps, past wire torn apart and thrown back in con-
fused masses by trench mortar bombs, and paused for a short
spell forty yards from the enemy parapet.
Bursting lungs gasped for breath until the barrage lifted
from the front line.
Then the raiders moved on.
Close to the parapet Fritz had restored one belt of wire A
powerful raider swung a straw mat.on to it; on that he jumped
swung another mat forward, and so on. Meanwhile, on each
Slcl ® ?, f l* 1 ™; men with huge wire-cutters hacked at the wire
until it fell, leaving a straw-matted path over which the raiders

ran. Then came the enemy borroAv ditch, Bft Avide, sft deep
and filled Avith loose wire and Avater —a difficult obstacle, but a
bridge had been made for crossing it. But the bridge was not
there. Its carriers had become casualties and it lay in shell-
torn fragments.
It did not matter, for the raiders chanced on the enemy’s
sally-post, a banked-up track through the ditch, crossed it,
rushed on to the parapet and looked doAVn into the enemy trench.
A Fritz is leaving a dug-out just beIOAV them; he sees them;
jumps back and endeavors to close the small iron door. No use,
a shot from a revolver and the door SAvings open. But Fitz has
gone doAvnstairs. He does not come up, although the raiders
Avith German phrases tell him “It is alright,” so the pin is drawn
from a Mill’s bomb, Avhich is throAvn down the dugout.
A shriek as one Boche dies, then six others cry “Kamarad,”
come up, and are sent to the lines as prisoners.
The raiders streamed on. Successive parties attacked the
second and third line as the barrage moved back; then, while
the area, 800 yards Avide and 350 yards deep, Avas being cleaned
up, the barrage settled down in a protection “box” clear of the
flanks and rear, protecting parties from a counter-attack.
A captured machine gun, a searchlight (the first ever
captured) and a few prisoners come from the trenches.
A loud roar as one party explodes a dump of minenwerfer,
and smaller detonations where doors and dugouts are blown in,
often entombing those inside; Boche who refused an invitation
to “Come out.” Many surrendered; a few put up a plucky fight,
but quickly learned the quality of the Australian bayonet.
Enemy material everywhere was destroyed, fires were
started here and there, the raiders revelling in an orgy of de-
struction, determined that this sector should be so utterly
wrecked that many months would pass before it could be re-
organised and re-equipped. Hundreds of bombs, scores of
rifles and dozens of snipers plates, too heavy to carry away,
were hurled over the parapets and splashed into the water-
logged borroAv-ditch, lost forever to the German army.
Meanwhile, the barrage continued in its protective fire,
torming a “box” at the rear and flanks. ’Twas a sight for admir-
ation and ever to be remembered. Our gunners demonstrated
their marvellous efficiency, and the raiders were loud in their
praise. “Why!” said one, “the barrage line was so straight that
you could have toasted bread at it.” Truly a risky experiment,
but, nevertheless, high praise.
One small counter attack was made. ’Twas half-hearted,
however, and entirely lost heart and broke when it met a third
line party of raiders which engaged it with Lewis Gun, rifle,
bayonet and revolver.
The raiders had been in the enemy trenches for thirty-five
minutes when the time for the withdrawal arrived, and the
word “Out” was passed. Systematically the raiders moved
back, first the third line parties; then the second line; then the
scouts and matmen, each covering the others movements.


Satisfied that all had reported to him the O.C. Assault cut
the telephone wire, the signallers picked up the ’phone and com-
pleted the stream of men moving toward their own line.
A raider was heard singing, “And we really had a most
delightful evening.” And so they had, but what about Fritz?
The enemy’s resistance had been at first by machine gun
fire from concrete emplacements .and he had caused casualties
during the raiders’ progress across No Man’s Land. A storming
party had been wiped out by a chance “pineapple” when moving
out from the trench, necessitating a re-organisation at almost
the last minute.
At zero, plus two minutes, the enemy had placed down his
5.0.5., or protective barrage, which claimed its toll in killed and
wounded; but neither that nor any other of his defences pre-
vented the raiders entering his trenches.
Out of all the 38th men engaged, casualties amounted to
only sixteen killed and forty-five wounded. Besides the seven-
teen prisoners sent back, it is estimated conservatively that
over two hundred enemy dead were left about when the raiders
withdrew. So one of the objectives showed the credit balance
on the side of the raiders—Twelve (12) Boche dead for one
Australian.
Once the raiders were within their own territory they moved
rapidly by overland tracks and through communication trenches
to the checking station, where they handed over their identity
labels and spoil, and received a fine ration of rum; then, mount-
ing the motor lorries waiting in the streets of Houplines they
were conveyed to their billets at Erquinghem, where they told
their stories, exhibited their souvenirs and fougtit the raid over
again before turning in for their well-earned rest: w T hile wearily
the officers labored over their reports until well after daylight.
All the usual raiding objectives were achieved.
The capture and destruction of enemy personnel, equipment,
defence material and arms was complete and huge. The impor-
tant items to the Intelligence Service were specimens of a
Minenwerfer fuse, and the first searchlight ever captured, which
showed improvements unknown to our own manufacturers.
Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Davis, of the 38th Battalion
(Commanding the Raiding Battalion) who had skil-
fully planned the raid, had again proved himself a
most capable leader, and it was in recognition of much splendid
work such as the big raid at Houplines, that he was a few months
later awarded the Distinguished Service Order.
Company Commanders were: —“A” Company (37th Batt.),
Capt. W. F. H. Robertson. “B” Company (38th Batt.), Caph
J. Akeroyd. “C” Company (38th Batt.), Capt. F. E. Fairweather
“ D ” Company (37th Batt.), Capt. W. J. Symons, VC
Capt. J. A. Akeroyd, who wa.s aiming the wounded, was
rendered unfit for further service in France, and returned to
Australia at a later date.
The da> after the raid, X Battalion joined the raiders at
Erquinghem Baths, when the 37th and 38th Battalions were
reformed. The latter unit relieved the 40th Battalion in the left


sub-sector of Bois Gremier on 2nd March, and was relieved by
the 4th South Lancashires eight days later, when it again retired
to Erquinghem and billeted for the night en route to Steinwerck
for a short period of special practise in the initial training of a
new formation of attack.
Ten days were spent at Steinwerck, and on the Third
Division retiring for a few' weeks’ rest from warfare, the Bat-
talion marched back to IVlorninghem in easy stages, via Haze-
hrouck and Wardrecques.
The fortnight spent at Moringhem was not a pleasant time.
The weather was bitterly cold and stormy. Deep snow covered
the ground, and driving showers of rain constantly swept the
countryside. On one occasion Avhen the Battalion was returning
lo billets from a Brigade practise in attack, it was caught in a
blizzard. Clouds of hard, fine snow beat down upon the column,
stinging and blinding everyone. With bowed heads, and faces
covered with aching hands, the Battalion struggled on through
snowdrifts, and halt smothered by the choking particles, finally
reached billets.
On April sth the Unit started back for the line, and experi-
enced one of the worst marches it e ir er had. Deep snow checked
the footsteps of the men struggling along with heavy packs and
•equipment. Lewis gunners dragged small handcarts loaded
with guns and ammunition. The wheels of these carts often
sank down into soft beds of snow', w T hen the gunners had a bad
time of it. By devious routes which unnecessarily extended the
march, the Battalion, worn out and fit to drop, reached Wallan
Capelle at dusk, where it was billeted for the night. The arrival
of the motor lorries bringing the blankets was eagerly awaited.
But it was not until one o’clock in the morning that they
turned up; so, for about six hours, worn-out men shivered with
the coldness of the night.
The march was resumed next morning. Weather condi-
tions had slightly improved, but the day’s journey of twenty-two
miles was a severe test, and when after eight p.m. the Battalion
entered Armentieres feet were blistered, and men hoboled pain-
fully along the hard cobblestone roads.
It is truly wonderful how quickly men will recove* from an
exhausting march. Next morning, apart from sore feet and a
certain amount of stiffness, everyone looked fit. The march was
discussed in rather ornate language; but now it was one of many
bitter experiences which belonged to the past, and one could
afford to joke about unpleasant incidents of the past two days.
Armentieres residents gave the Unit a hearty welcome back
to the old town, and the next ten days were very pleasant ones.
The Y.M.C.A. cinema, and the “Coo-ees” 3rd Divisional Concert
Party, attracted large audiences with their splendid programmes.
On the 16th April the left sector at Houplines was taken
•over from the 40th Battalion. Here the trenches were in good
condition, and strongly-built dugouts roofed with bow iron proved
weatherproof and comfortable. Artillery daily strafed the enemy
who always retaliated. While these artillery duels were fought
the front line was practically vacated, for the enemy always
battered the breastworks.


The Battalion was relieved on the 26th April by the 2/6
King’s Own Liverpool Regiment and three days later retired to
Oosthove Farm, in Ploegsteert-St. Yves sector, as a reserve-
\attalion.
Here a very enjoyable fortnight was spent. Comfortable
huts and a large farmhouse which was surrounded by a moat,
accommodated the Unit. The days were warm with early
Spring sunshine; budding trees rapidly unfolded bright green
leaves; and in the fields buttercups and daisies peeped up
through the young grass. In the daytime working parties dug
gun pits and cable trenches a few miles out from the farm.
This work was done under pleasant conditions, and proved en-
joyable exercise.
Towards the end of the stay the quietness of Oosthove
Farm was rudely disturbed for two nights. Short intense-
shoots by the artillery on the whole of the Corps front awakened
the enemy guns, and a neighboring battery drew shell-fire upon
the farm when everyone sought shelter in the surrounding
fields and slept out in the open.
On the 13th May the Unit moved up into Ploegsteert Wood,
to relieve the 40th Battalion at Rifle House, and be in support
to the 37th Battalion. Entering the wood was like passing into
Fairyland. Here Spring reigned in all her fresh, sweet beauty.
Golden shafts of sunshine pierced leafy canopies, and quivered
in beds of bright green grasses. Pale yellow primroses, golden
buttercups, and white daisies embroidered the green carpet of
the wood, which stole all noises from the foot. Clusters of
dark violets peeped out from mossy beds, and seas of pale blue
hyacinths bent their heads to the breezes. Duckboard tracks
wound in and out among flaming copper beeches and pink
blossomed chestnuts.
Before war broke out Ploegsteert Wood was the hunting
ground of the King of Belgium. Beautiful as it now was what
must its peaceful beauty have been in those days. Now the
harsh barking of eighteen-pounders interrupted the song birds
as they flooded the sunny glades with melody. The duckboard
tracks running through the wood were named after London
streets. Picadilly Circus, The Strand, Regent Street, Haymarket
and many other familiar names greeted one from fingerposts.
Rifle House, where Battalion Headquarters was established, was
in the neighborhood of Picadilly Circus. This building, like
most of the homes in the wood, had sandbag walls, and was
roofed with old iron. Perhaps the finest building in the wood
was Ploegsteert Hall, which was at one time Captain Bruce
Bairnsfather’s Company Headquarters. It was built of logs in
the Canadian style, and here the famous artist drew many of his
well-known pictures. Ploegsteert Hall was afterwards destroyed
by shell-fire and its original sign was salved from the ruins by
Lieut.-Colonel (then Major) Hurry of this Battalion, who pre-
sented it to the A.I.F. War Records Section.
Life in the woods for the next few clays was delightful
Men stretched themselves out on grassy beds and enjoyed the
warm sunshine.


Enemy aeroplanes would sometimes pass overhead, but
the leafy trees screened all movements in the wood. All day
long the eighteen pounders roared among the trees, and shells
screamed over to the enemy.
Fresh batteries took up their positions and it was not long
before enemy shells were searching for them. From this time
onward the Battalion was subjected to a good deal of shell-fire.
One night the enemy guns poured salvo after salvo into tho
neighborhood of Rifle House, and for an hour the air was full
of flying wood and iron.
To the enemy there must have been every indication of a
coming offensive, for the increase of guns which continually
harassed him for miles along the line spoke of a big battle in
the near future.
On the 22nd May the Battalion moved forward and relieved
the 37th Battalion in the front line beyond the wood. Next day
another Unit took over a portion of the front, the 38th Battalion
holding from Ainscroft Avenue to Ash Lane.
A raiding party of seven officers and 214 other ranka
chosen from all companies attacked the enemy at two o’clock on
the morning of the 28th. The party was divided into two columns
of which one effected an entry into the enemy’s trench and
brought back a prisoner. Unfortunately the raiding party suf-
fered heavy casualties, many of which were caused by our own
barrage. Two officers (2nd-Lieuts. Killingsworth and Blair) and
twenty-eight other ranks were killed or missing; two officers
and sixty-three other ranks being wounded.
Lieuts. W. H. MeCullock and T. H. Kennedy were awarded
the Military Cross for courageous conduct in the face of the
enemy. Lieut. Kennedy, although wounded in his right hand,
attacked a party of the enemy, killing several, and forcing a
sergeant-major to surrender at the point of an empty pistol
grasped in his wounded hand. Pte. F. Lock was awarded the*
D.C.M. for conspicuous bravery.
CHAPTER HI.
BATTLES OF MESSINES, YPRES AND PASSCHENDAELE.
On the 2nd of June the Battalion was relieved and retired
to Brune Gay to prepare for the great battle of Messines of
June 7th.
Previous to the Battalion moving out from the wood Lieut.
Hyett, who had just been appointed Burial Officer to the Third
Division, paid his old friends a visit, and on his way bade
to Division was killed by a shell at Hyde Park Corner.


At Brune Gay several interesting days were spent studying
a model of the area to be attacked by the Third Division. This
model was a wonderful piece of work; miniature hills, woods,
winding rivers, and the battered town of Messines had been
cleverly and artistically made, and one looked down upon them
as an airman might study country lying a thousand feet below.
Lectures were given, and important features of the country were
pointed out so that everyone should be quite familiar with
them.
Kits and equipment were overhauled and every preparation
for the attack was made.
The day on which it was to/ be launched upon the enemy
was not disclosed until six p.m. on June 6th when everyone was
warned to be in readiness to move up to the “jumping off” posi-
tions in four hours time. Bombs, picks, shovels, and forty-eight
hours rations were issued; and after being served with a hot
meal, at 9.30 the Battalion moved forward by platoons.
The march up to the line was a fearful ordeal. Ten min
utes after leaving Brune Hay the enemy bombarded the roads
with gas shells. The night was sultry, and gas masks almost
suffocated everyone; while the mica eyepieces became blurred,
making it difficult for men to keep in touch with one another.
Added to this the roads were badly congested with traffic;
ammunition columns often blocked the way, and, here and there
shattered waggons and horses were strewn across the roads. At
last it became utterly impossible to make any headway, so the
Battalion took to the open fields and groped its way through
Ploegsteert Wood.
But the Wood also proved a hot corner. Shells were
crashing in among the trees, and whirlwinds of wood and iron
swept down upon the half suffocated men, who, through the
dimmed windows of their masks sought to penetrate the inky
blackness of the Wood.
Every now and then men lost touch with their comrades
and wandered away from the duckboard tracks (which could
only be seen when lit up by a bursting shell) to become lost
among the trees. Others fell wounded by the way, and patiently
waited for the stretcher-bearers.
At 2 a.m. the jumping off positions were reached by the
exhausted and disorganised parties. These particular trenches
had been specially dug for the attack and were situated about
midway between the front and support lines, a rough, shallow,
quickly-dug line, but, nevertheless, a haven of rest after that
nightmare of an approach march. In places the line ran over
high ground clear of the gas and those troops fortunate to be
occuoying these positions could remove their masks and drink
in the fresh air.
Zero Hour was fixed for 3.10 am. and while awaiting that
hour parties were rearranged for the attack. All were eager
for the “hop off” and were keen on getting “some of their own”
back on the enemy who had given them such a rough time for
the past two hours or more. All felt positive of success on
account of the elaborate preparations which had been made for


the “stunt”; and, furthermore by the fact that every man knew
exactly the nature of the job ahead of him, being in possession
of almost as much information regarding the operation as the
most senior officer.
Waiting to “hop off” creates a nervous tension. As the
hands of the watch creep slowly, oh! how slowly, on toward zero-
nour a feeling of restlessness creeps along the line. Hands
reach for the rifles lying against the side of the trench, and pre-
sently the bayonets commence to quiver. The limbs of strong,
eager men quiver with an excitement which refuses to be
calmed. Men constantly peer into the luminous faces of their
watches.
Surely the blessed “ticker” has stopped!
A trembling hand puts the watch to an ear. An excited
brain almost refuses to register the calm little “tick-tick, tick-
tick.” Yes, it is going alright, but, dear God! how slowly. An
evil spirit seems to have put a brake on the wheels.
And so the minutes crawl slowly on, and men count every
passing second, and in an attempt to check their excitement
again review the movements which are to take place when
those long minutes have dragged out their existence. The
attack is to be made in three waves.
First Wave. —“D” Company (Major A. J. A. Maudsley, 0.C.)
with 5 and 6 Platoons of “B” Company.
Second Wave.—“A” Company (Captain R. E. Trebilcock,
0.C.) with 7 and 8 Platoons of “B” Company.
Third Wave. —“C” Company (Captain F. E. Fairweather,.
0.C.).
The task allotted to the First Wave is that of capturing
Ungodly Trench and establishing a line slightly in advance of
it joining up with the New Zealanders on the left and the 39th
Battalion on the right.
The Second Wave is to mop up in rear of the First and
then continue the advance through Ungodly Trench to a distance
of about 800 yards and there consolidate, this to be known as
the Black Line. New Zealand troops to be on the left and the
9th Brigade on the right.
The Third Wave is to mop up for the Second and it also
is to be consolidated in rear of the Black Line. One Company
of the 40th Battalion is to build bridges across the La Douve-
River, to alloW the attackers to cross. •
The barrage is to take the form of a “jumping barrage”,
500 yards every three minutes, with the following exceptions:
To rest for a period of 37 minutes on Ulcer Reserve line; one
hour seven minutes on Ungodly Trench, and a further period
of six hours in front of the Black Lane. The barrage would
include machine gun fire with artillery, and from what one knew
of its strength and staying powers there would not be many
Boche left in those places to meet the attackers. The signal
for the barrage to open out would be the exploding of the mines
under the enemy trenches in the village of Messines. Engineers
had tunnelled under the hill in a most wonderful way and had
prepared a fearful death-trap for the enemy.


“Tick-tick, tick-tick,” the little luminous hands are ticking
out the remaining seconds. Men brace themselves for the
attack, and then —the success of the great work the engineers
and miners had been toiling at for months past was revealed to
them.
First of all the ground shook under the attacking troops
with earthquake effect. For one alarming moment it seemed
that the earth would belly up and hurl them into eternity. And
then the shaking underfoot abruptly ceased; and half-left, at
Messines a volcano shot a volume of flame skyward sweeping
aside the grey light of dawn, and flooding the countryside with
blood-red light. A sickening, crunching roar shook the air,
reverberated through the aisles of Ploegsteert Wood; and
echoed along valleys and among hills for miles and miles
around.
And so with one loud, fearful cry the tortured earth gave
birth to death and destruction. And as that all-fearful voice
died down the roar of the barrage challenged the enemy guns.
Thousands of steel throats were belching forth flame and smoke,
and hurling tons of screaming iron down upon the enemy.
Machine gun bullets were forming a leaden curtain above the
heads of the attackers, a curtain which spread out to the enemy.
The effect of the exploding of the mines, and the confident roar
of the barrage had an excellent moral effect upon the storming
troops, a battle tonic which sent the First Wave clambering out
of the trepches, while with difficulty the Second and Third
Waves were restrained from joining them. The feeling of
restlessness now took flight and with light hearts they pressed
on to their objective. Although the ground passed over was
extremely rough, being a wilderness of shell holes, the old front
line of trenches was soon crossed. ’Twas not long ere the
Second Wave had overtaken the First which had successfully
gained its objective.
Aeroplanes had marked the positions of enemy batteries
and had almost immediately silenced many of their voices as
they opened out in reply. But there were still many guns
active and shells burst about the attackers, the noise of their
explosions being unheard on account of the terrific roar of our
barrage. The only knowledge of the presence of an enemy shell
was that the concussion would be felt or casualties would be
observed.
The artillery barrage was so accurate that men quickly
gained confidence to rest almost under the shrapnel bursts
as they waited for them to lift farther back.
The Second Wave had now reached the river and to their
great consternation discovered that the bridges for crossing had
not been put into position. In one place a tree had fallen
aci oss the stream and this was used as a bridge by many of
the troops. A number waded through the water in shallow
places but experienced difficulty on account of wire. Ulcer
Reserve was reached with a minimum of casualties. During
the 37 minutes which elapsed while waiting for the barrage to
lift all trenches were stormed and mopped up when many pris-
oners were taken.


The barrage lifting again the attackers pressed on meeting
very little opposition and finally arrived in rear of the fiery cur-
tain licking up Ungodly Trench for one hour and seven minutes
to enable the New Zealanders to come up on the left.
At this stage all three waves were together, and men
quickly got busy on shell holes making themselves as safe as
possible from enemy shell fire. Nothing of note happened during
this rest. This barrage continued to lick up Ungodly Trench
while the waves were re-organised for the continuance of the
advance. Men were fatigued after the trying and exciting night
and the dawn’s work, and despite the deafening crashes of
shells many fell asleep.
At last the barrage lifted. On went the First Wave,
storming what was left of Ungodly Trench, and on to capture
Schnitzel Farm. The Second Wave followed closely by the
Third pushed on to meet a fair amount of opposition, mostly
machine gun and rifle fire. A strong point in the shape of a
huge dug-out with machine gun posts established was captured
and yielded many prisoners and guns.
The enemy were now retreating to their next line but were
quickly followed by the attackers who shot them down as they
retreated, or took prisoner those who gave themselves up.
Those that managed to escape would become casualties in the
barrage.
Bethleem Farm and the Huts were ultimately reached and
captured, these points yielding up many prisoners. The barrage
now halted in front of where the storming troops were to con-
solidate. The knowledge that it would shelter them only for a
certain time spurred them on to dig as quickly as possible a
narrow, deep trench connecting up with shell holes.
The Battalion’s final objective had now been won. A
brilliant achievement which gave much satisfaction to those now
holding the captured ground.
Major A. J. A. Maudsley, who had charge of forward opera-
tions, established Headquarters near Schnitzel Farm and
directed all movements, also establishing a centre of communica-
tion. The forward signal party connected this position by
’phone to the Brigade cable head, which also connected with
Battalion Battle Headquarters.
This line was successfully maintained throughout the re
maining operations.
At ten minutes past three in the afternoon, incidentally,
twelve hours to the very minute after zero hour, the 37th Bat-
talion passed through the Black Line to capture the Green Line,
but owing to heavy shelling by the enemy and the suffering of
heavy casualties this Unit was ordered to retire and assist the
38th Battalion to consolidate their positions. It was reported
that the enemy was preparing a counter attack which the 37th
Battalion would not be strong enough to beat back. But owing
to the good work of our 1 artillery this counter attack failed to
develop. At 3 a.m. on the following morning, Friday, Bth June,
the 44th Battalion reinforced the two battalions and then passed
on to successfully capture the Green Line.


These positions were held throughout the day, and in
the early hours of Saturday morning came the cheering news
of an early relief which took place just before dawn. As soon
as the relieving troops appeared the men of the 38th Battalion
were informed that they could independently make their way
back to billets at Brune Gay by the easiest and safest route
possible.
There was no need for this information to be repeated;
rifles were snatched up and across country streamed a motley
throng of weary, ragged, battle-stained men; a scene which made
one think that the world’s scarecrows had banded together
from the four corners of the earth.
Thus ended the Battle of Messines, which instantly brought
the Third Division into prominence, and placed its troops among
the world’s greatest fighters.
The Infantry accepted the praise they had won with a
“Diggers” true modesty and passed it on to the artillery and
machine gunners whose wonderful work alone had enabled them
to perform their tasks in such a brilliant and successful manner.
Countless deeds of heroism had been performed and the
following awards were won for the 38th Battalion. —
THE MILITARY CROSS.
Captain F. E. Fairweather, for courageous and able leader-
ship of the Third Wave.
Captain R. E. Trebilcock, for gallant conduct and resource-
fulness in commanding the Second Wave.
THE DISTINGUISHED CONDUCT MEDAL.
Sergt. P. L. Nihill, on 29th May, in the raid at Ploegsteert,
brought in several wounded from the wire near the enemy
trenches, and for this courageous act and for good work at
Messines was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.
Lance-Corporal G. B. Fullerton rushed a dugout, bayoneted
several Boche and captured 30 prisoners.
Thirteen Military Medals were won as per appendix.
On the 12th June the Battalion moved by route march to
hutments at Kortepyp. The distance of this place from Brune
Gay was not great, and by midday all were settled down in the
conveniently-placed and well-drained camp, where they stayed
for a period of six days, during which time working parties
were sent out daily to do repair work in the back area.
The next move was to Regina Camp, which consisted of a
mixture of huts and tents in addition to a large deserted farm
dwelling; the latter proving useful as a store, and for the ac-
commodation of some troops.
The Battalion was not destined to stay long in one place.
On account of military necessity which embraces so much, it is
rarely found that a unit can remain in the same locality for
much more than a week. This time it was not the will of the
authorities that caused the shift.


The enemy, no doubt through aerial observation, knew
exactly the location of the camp, and began to strafe it with
long range, high velocity guns. The bombardments, however,
were not intense, yet they were lively enough to cause the occu-
pants of tents and huts alike to scamper to the open fields. Such
is the method of the German gunners that once they have been
directed on to a particular target they fire off their programme
on to that spot, so the obvious thing to do is to move outside
the area even away from cover.
As the result of these bombardments the Battalion was
moved to another area.
The wisdom of this procedure was proved later when Regina
Camp was almost demolished by artillery fire.
Although the distance to the new area was not great the
operation was carried out in two stages. On the first night the
Battalion rested in tents at Hillside Camp (Kortepyp). It was
there that it witnessed for the first time a combined effort by
enemy aeroplanes to destroy our long line of observation bal-
loons, which on account of the continuous fine weather and
consequent good visibility, was daily sent up to carry on silent
though most important work. Two aeroplanes made the attempt
and partly succeeded. Four balloons were shot down in flames
in quick succession, and the occupants of the remaining three in
that locality lost no time in jumping out into mid air with
their parachutes. It was a unique sight to see at least a dozen
men dangling in the air and slowly drifting with the breeze, to
finally reach terra firma without having any choice as to where
they would land.
On the following day the journey was continued and com-
pleted, so that on the 23rd June the Battalion found itself
once again in tents in what was known as the Douve River
Camp.
After the strenuous work in connection with the Messines
operation the Battalion was due for a short spell, and it was
decided that this period of rest should be enjoyed in the vicinity
of Mont Kemmell; in fact, it was almost at the foot of the Mont
that the Tenth Brigade settled down.
The River Douve flowed through the site; green hedges in-
tersected the countryside and the presence of the ridge of high
ground, or Mont, gave a little grandeur to what was, compara-
tively speaking a peaceful little spot.
Training of the less irksome nature was commenced and
carried out with enthusiasm, as each battalion of the Brigade
was anxious to appear at its best in the forthcoming Military
Competition. Sports and cricket matches were organised; in-
deed, such relaxation was regarded almost as important as tne
military training. The Brigade cricket match wcio won by
Brigade Headquarters team after a keen struggle with the 3'i ch
Battalion.
All eliminating contest was held on the same day to select
the best complete Transport Section turnout to represent the
Brigade in the Divisional Horse Show which was mooted for a
fortnight later. This contest was won by the 38th Battalion by
a narrow margin from the 40th Battalion. From this day until


July Bth, the day chosen for the Divisional meeting, horses,
harness and vehicles were cleaned and polished to such an extent
that when they appeared in the show-ring it was agreed that
the turnout was as near perfection as possible. The judges
had an easy task in deciding to award the prize for the best
complete Transport turnout in the Division (a silver cup pre-
sented by Major-General Sir John Monash, G.0.C.) to the 38th
Battalion. Other prizes won by the Transport Section were.
—Pair of light draught horses and waggon (third prize, Driver
S. McCorkill); pair of light draught mules and waggon (third
prize, Lance-Corporal A. W. Landells); comic turnout (Q.M. Store
staff). The Battalion’s Transport Section created on that day
(and has held ever since) a record second to none for turnout
and general efficiency .
At these sports meetings and contests all ranks turned
out to support in a vocal manner their own unit, and although
their sporting instinct led them to applaud the brilliance of the
opposing side, the esprit de corps, which was so strong in them,
caused much satisfaction and pride when their own particular
Team came out victorious at the end of the day.
Thus the time was spent. Everyone forgot that the greatest
of wars was still being continued.
Occasionally the distant muttering of guns, or a squadron
of aeroplanes overhead might momentarily recall the latter
fact.
When the time came again to get on with the more serious
work the efficiency and the morale of the Battalion; in fact, of
the whole Brigade, were at their best.
The next zone of activity of the Battalion was the support
trenches at Messines,- which were taken over from the 34th
Battalion.
It was impossible to carry out the usual arrangements for
the accommodation of the personnel, i.e., establishment in
comfortable billets, for it must be remembered that this par-
ticular part of the country only a few months previously had
suffered under our heavy bombardments, and in turn from the
enemy retaliation.
However, by using the half-demolished pill-boxes, and
•cellars of ruined houses in the town of Messines; and by con-
structing a number of dugouts from material obtained from
adjacent dumps, the Battalion was able to get enough shelter
both from the elements and any observation of the enemy.
Each Company had a pill-hox for its Company Headquarters
around which trenches and dugouts were made, thus forming
Company groups with Battalion Headquarters at a distance
convenient for all Companies.
Working parties were required nightly by the front line
Battalion for the purpose of constructing an adequate system
of trenches for the defence of the locality. A good deal of this
work devolved upon the 38th Battalion so that it was not long
before all ranks became acquainted with such places as Sep-
tieme Barn, Blauen Molen, and Huns Walk.


The working parties generally finished their tasks by mid-
night and then retired to their dugouts to enjoy a well-earned
rest. On two occasions, however, they were disturbed during
the night by the whistling sounds of shells. On hearing these
and the subsequent “plonk, plonk” of the low-explosions every-
one realised that they were being subjected to a bombardment
of gas shells, and at once donned their respirators. It was
afterwards discovered that the particular species of gas used
was of the Vesicent variety, commonly known as mustard gas.
There was also a sprinkling of a shell called Blue Cross contain-
ing a substance, which, as the result of the explosion, assumed
a powdered form and caused irritation to the nose and throat,
and copious sneezing—hence sneezing gas.
These bombardments, although very annoying at the time,
resulted in few casualties, but the blisters caused by contact of
the skin with the mustard gas liquid for the time was the subject
of much alarm both to the sufferers and the remaining troops.
This anxiety was dispelled when it was subsequently observed
that these new gases were not as formidable from a lethal point
of view as their contemporaries phosgene, etc.
It was during the stay in this area that the Battalion lost
Lieuts. Abbey and Wvndham who were killed on the morning of
the 17th July. Unfortunately it was the last shell of a shoot
which struck the shelter in which these two officers had sought
cover. The loss did not end there. The same shell, in addition,
accounted for the death of Sergeants Onions and Cunningham,
and Pte. A. W. Marlow the last named being one of the family
so well-known in the Battalion. All were buried next day by
Chaplain Hayden in the Kandahar Cemetery, situated on the road
to Neuve Eglise.
On the 20th July the Unit was relieved by the 40th Bat-
talion and retired to a camp near Neuve Eglise, where it stayed
for a period of fifteen days. This period may be described as
practically uneventful. A long-range gun of huge calibre in
the vicinity of the camp was the object of some interest to all
ranks. The enemy also paid it some attention, but all attempts
made by him to destroy it were unsuccessful.
Then a move was made in a rearward direction, and an-
other prolonged stay was made at the Tankodrome Camp, near
Dranoutre. This was another stage in the movement back to
the rest area, and no time was lost in settling down to the pre-
liminaries of training. By this time the spell of fine weather
had broken, so there was a feeling of relief when orders came
to evacuate the damp floored tents for a place somewhere west.
Entrainment was carried out at Bailleul on the morning of
August 14th, and by midday the Battalion, which had detrained
at Wizernes, was route marching to its destination, Senlecques.
which was reached after a long and strenuous journey that
taxed to the limit, and in many cases over it, the staying powers
of all concerned.
The Battalion arrived at Senlecques about midnight, when
the kindly townsfolk turned out of their warm beds to welcome
all, light fires, serve suppers, and see everyone comfortably
settled down in billets.


Morning revealed a smiling landscape. Summer sunshine
flooded green and gold fields where poppies nodded in the breeze.
Birds sang gaily in the green-hedged lanes; rooks cawed and
flopped about in the tops of tall poplars; while wayside brooks
played a tiny tune for one’s footsteps.
A mile across a green vale lay the village of La Calique,
where “C” and “D” Companies were billeted.
After the shell-torn battlefields, and their attendant noises r
how lovely and peaceful was this sunny little corner of France.
The warm-hearted inhabitants extended their friendship in
a simple, irresistible manner, which quickly captivated the ever
friendly Australian.
Happy days followed. When parade hours were over sol-
diers would be seen helping their French friends in the farming
fields. Always there were willing hands to turn the well windlass
and draw water for Marie or Hortense; and old toothless Grand-
mere would be assisted in the vegetable garden.
At night happy little companies gathered round the fires
in the large farm kitchens and sipped coffee or wine. Perhaps
“Madame” would have eggs for sale, when one of her saucepans
would be requisitioned and all would sit down to an enjoyable
supper ere retiring to billets.
In the neighborhood where the Transport Section was
billeted lived a Frenchwoman who thought it would be wise to
lock up her fowlhouse in case the members of the Transport
should stray into it in search of eggs. A hole was cut in the
door which allowed entrance for fowls only.
Every morning and evening Madame would unlock the door
and collect her eggs. Naturally her caution interested the
Transport people. Perhaps they rather resented her distrust in
them. After a short consultation it was decided that a certain
member of the Section should be detailed to daily relieve the
fowlhouse of some of the eggs. Entrance to the hen nests
could not be made by any man until the strong padlock had been
broken, or the'door knocked in. The day after arrangements
had been made to raid the fowlhouse, a puzzled Frenchwoman
found that the nests were nearly all devoid of eggs. The door
and lock had not been tampered with; no one could have a key
to fit the old-fashioned lock; and/ yet, somehow or other, the
eggs had been taken. Every day the nests contained a few odd
eggs instead of about two dozen. Madame might fortify the
door with heavy cart chains and declare the men of the Trans-
port to be “brigandes” (without being able to prove that they
were) and still the eggs mysteriously disappeared.
When Madame was busily working in an adjacent field,
Jacko, the Transport mascot, with all a monkey’s cunning, would
sneak in through the hole cut in the door and hand out the
eggs to his soldier comrades.
When the Transport Section left Senecques Madame was
delighted and amazed at the generosity of the men who presented
her with a bundle of franc notes.
It was the price of the stolen eggs.


The six weeks period of rest will ever be remembered as
one of the happiest times the Battalion had in France. Five
kilomentres distant from billets was the fine town of Desvres.
One of the attractions of the town was a large swimming bath
at the Potteries. This bath measured 50ft by 28ft by 6ft and
was always full of warm water.
Roads leading out from Senlecques wound their way
through golden fields and twisted down into green valleys. The
hours of training were made pleasant by delightful surroundings;
and route marches along flower-flanked roads and shady lanes
were thoroughly enjoyed. Special training for a big battle in
the near future was carried out when the 38th Battalion met
the sister battalions of the Tenth Brigade, which were billeted in
neighboring townships.
An amusing incident (which would, no doubt, have pleased
certain harsh critics of the Australian Army who state that we
are an undisciplined lot) occurred during a practise field opera-
tion by the Tenth Brigade. Orders were given that strict silence
be observed. The Brigade was strictly obeying the order when
a hare rushed in among the ranks. This chance of sport proved
too much of a test to keep silence and order. The ranks broke,
and steel hats whizzed through the air as the bewildered hare
dodged in and out among his pursuers. The chase was fast and
furious. Finally, the hare was killed by a barrage of steel hats.
On the 22nd September the Third Division was inspected by
the Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshall Sir Douglas Haig. The
inspection took place in a field near Drionville.
The weather was good, and the Division formed up in
battalions en masse presented a fine military spectacle. A party
of Red Cross sisters witnessed the inspection, and the visitors
were afterwards entertained by the Battalion.
The Unit bade farewell to Senlecques and La Calique on
Sept. 25th, and for four days marched by easy stages via
Assinghem, Lynde and Terdeghem to a camp in the neighborhood
of Winnizeele.
On the 2nd of October the Battalion proceeded by motor
buses to Vlarmertinghe, and marched to a bivouac area east of
Ypres on the right of Ypres-Zonnebeke road.
Early in September, 1917, the fighting at Ypres had begun.
This series of operations east of the town, lasting until well on
in the month of November, was called the Third Battle of Ypres.
Every week after careful artillery preparation a fresh attack
was launched and new ground won; and it was in two of these
attacks —phases of the great battle, as they were called —the
38t.h Battalion took a prominent part.
On the night of October 2/3, as already mentioned, the
Battalion bivouacked under the hedge of a field just east of
the town, and on the right of the Ypres-Zonnebeke road. It
rained during the night and those who had neglected to take
precautions against the weather found themselves wet through
when dawn arrived. However, the day of the 3rd was fine, and
the sun. with the aid of fires, soon made amends for the state
of the weather experienced during the night. On this day final
preparations were made for the coming attack. Officers were


busy gathering information about the operation and at the first
opportunity passing it on to all concerned. N.C.O.’s were em-
ployed in issuing the additional battle equipment, such as flares,
S.O.S. signal rockets, extra water bottles and the many other
articles so necessary for the attacking troops. All officers and
a proportion of N.C.O.’s and men (chiefly scouts) spent half the
day in a reconnaissance of the approach route and the area to be
assaulted, the former, by the way, not being finally completed
until late in the afternoon. The place of assembly and the
various land marks, so necessary for the maintenance of direc-
tion. were distinctly visible through field glasses, their positions
being verified on the spot by reference to the maps which had
been liberally supplied.
It was during these expeditions before the battle that
one got an insight into some of the methods of organisation and
saw the necessity of careful and thorough preparation of all
details. The roads were necessarily crammed full of vehicles
of all kinds, motor and horse, pack mules laden with shells and
ammunition; equestrians from the rank of Major-General down
to Private; guns drawn both by tractor and horse; and, finally,
the small bodies of men on foot threading their way through the
traffic. One wondered how any movement at all was possible
with such apparent over-crowding. Nevertheless, it was achieved
and much credit is due to those responsible for traffic control
and road repair, and all other personnel employed to assist in
the passage of all arms along the roads.
The 10th Brigade was allotted a frontage of just over 500
yards for the attack. On the right the 11th Brigade had a
similar frontage, whilst a New Zealand Brigade was made
responsible for the ground on the immediate left.
The order for the attack within the 10th Brigade was 37th,
38th, 39th, and 40th Battalions, and the system to be employed
was the leap frog method. By this it is meant that the 37th
Battalion captured the first objective, the 38th the second and
so on, the 40th being the rear Battalion, had the furthest objec-
tive —a distance of about 2000 yards.
The various companies of the Battalion were disposed in
the following order: —First Wave, two platoons of C Company
(Captain Selleck) left, and two platoons of D Company (Cap-
tain Orchard) right, followed by B Company (Captain E. F.
Moore) as moppers up. Second Wave: Remainder of C and D
Companies; A Company (Captain Dench) in rear as reserve
Company.
The objective was described as “C.S”, actually a line run-
ning N.W. and S.E. in front of Bordeaux and Springfield Farms.
Tentative Headquarters for the Brigade and the various
Battalions were established in the various concrete dug-outs, as
near as possible to the jumping-off place, then later were
moved forward and established in the dugouts allotted to them
just in rear of their Units. It happened that the 38th Battalion
Headquarters pill-box (Mitchell Farm) was still full of and
surrounded by dead Hermans, making the place uninhabitable
so that Major Hurry, who was in command, together with his
staff were obliged to take possession of Square Farm for their
temporary Headquarters.

| 4,
VI.—LILLE GATE. YPRES.






Zero hour was fixed at 6 a.m. on the morning of the 4th.
As the whole Brigade had to use the one avenue of approach-*
“K” track —the leading Battalion for the attack had to move off
at an hour sufficiently early to allow the reaii Battalion to be
in position in ample time.
The approach march commenced without a hitch, the 38th
following the 37th in single file along the duckboards of the
track. Then came the other two Battalions, also in single file.
Thus it might be said that the whole Brigade was in single file,
though it is probable that the front Battalion was getting into
position before the rear Unit had actually left its quarters.
The desultory shelling which was in progress increased in
intensity as the troops approached the Assembly ground. Casual-
ties were inevitable, still the gaps were closed and the Hood
of manhood pressed on, while the stretcher-bearers silently per-
formed their duty to those who were forced by wounds to fall
out. Everybody was anxious to push on, but it was apparent
that there would be some little delay to allow each Company in
succession to assume its correct formation and proper position.
However, by midnight the 38th Battalion was reposing in shell
holes along the latter and the shelling had died down a little. Evi-
dently the enemy had not noticed anything unusual happening.
Even our own artillery, which had been carrying out its cover-
ing bombardment, now that the necessity for such was over,
closed down to enjoy a short rest before the big event.
It must not be thought, however, that firing had wholly
ceased. Such a display cf inactivity on the part of the British
gunners would at once give an indication to a shrewd enemy
that something was “in the wind.”
At about 5.30 a.m. observers noticed on the right a display
of lights of all color's, and it was at once thought that the
enemy had perceived us. This impression was confirmed as
the alarm spread along the whole front. An enemy barrage
was put down, but there was nothing for us but to sit fast and
endure it, and pray for the hands of the clock to move faster
towards zero hour.
At last it came! A sigh of relief escaped from every mouth
as each man got up to follow the leading waves. Our barrage
was splendid, and the immediate and almost complete silence of
the Boche guns gave a clear indication that those of our guns
responsible for counter battery work were carrying out their
job to perfection.
The 38th Battalion followed close upon the heels of the
37th Battalion, and all obstacles were speedily overcome. On
the left practically the only opposition came from a single
machine gun post, which was quickly subdued by our men in
conjunction with the New Zealanders. In the centre a Machine
Gun post at Israel House gave trouble for a time, but it in its
turn received its quietus. The concrete pill-boxes about Judah
House and Springfield Farm caused a little anxiety and delay.
The capture of these strong posts yielded several machine guns
and about 150 prisoners. In almost every case the opposition
was overcome by working around to the rear of the obstacle
and throwing in a “P” bomb or Mills grenade as an inducement
to the occupants to come up and “Kamarade.”


Generally speaking, our men kept so close to the barrage
that they were upon the enemy before he had time to recover
from its effects.
The Battalion’s objective was reached by 7.30 a.m. and con-
solidation immediately began under the direction of Capt. W. H.
Orchard, w r ho found himself in charge of the attacking troops
after the death of Captain E- F. Moore and the retirement,
through wounds, of Captain H. F. Selleck. It was the efficient
manner in which he (Captain Orchard) carried out his task of
reorganisation, and his cheerfulness under depressing circum-
stances that earned for him the Military Cross.
By this time Battalion Headquarters had reached Judah
House and touch was immediately established with the forward
troops by means of runner and telephone.
At 9.39 a.m. an enemy aeroplane flew low over the line but
apparently failed to locate it, as the hostile artillery was at no
time very accurate.
Early in the afternoon a platoon of “D” Company (No. 15;
was sent forward to reinforce the 39th Battalion, and one
Company of 150 men was organised to he ready to move for-
ward at a moment’s notice to assist in a contemplated further
advance.
On the night of October 5/6, at 9 p.m., the enemy put
down a heavy box barrage, which, however, caused compara-
tively few casualties. Several times during the night our S.O.S.
signals were sent up from the front line and the response by
our artillery was wonderfully prompt.
On one occasion—the last —when the signal was sent up
the batteries of machine guns which had been established in
rear as an additional support to the artillery opened fire alon»e.
This was sufficient in itself to check any attempt at counter
attack.
That same night the Battalion was relieved by the 28th
Manchesters and marched through Ypres to hutments in the
neighborhood of Vlamentinghe, which were reached by 6.30 on
the morning of October 6th. An excellent breakfast had been
prepared, and after having supplied the wants of the “inner man’’
all ranks settled down, and soon the misery of the mud and the
fury of the battle were forgotten, being lost in deep slumbers,
all the more enjoyable because of the absence of any rest what-
ever during the preceding three days.
The Casualties for the operation were:
Killed. Wound. Missing. Total.
Officers 1 l o 2
110 2
Other Ranks .. .. 33 142 7 182
34 143
7 184
The total personnel engaged was approximately 650, so that
the percentage of casualties, which works out at 29 can be re-
garded as low; wheras the experience gained by all ranks, to-
gether with the amount of ground won from, and damage


inflicted on. the enemy was considerable; so great, in fact, that,
although casualties are inevitable even though regrettable, the
balance of profit was much to the Battalion’s credit.
Prisoners captured by us amounted to about 300. Major
G. Hurry (now Lieut.-Colonel), who as already mentioned was
in command of the Battalion, was awarded the D.S.O. He
showed a fine example to all ranks and fought his Battalion with
great skill, contributing largely towards the success of the
operation.
The courage and devotion to duty displayed by Sergeant
J. S. Shilliday (now Lieut.) and Lance-Corpl. A. A. G. Bright,
earned for each the D.C.M.
Thirteen Military Medals were won by the Battalion during
the operation.
For a few days following the relief of the Battalion reorgani-
sation was speedily carried out. Platoons had to be made up to
strength for further fighting, and for this purpose the nucleus
personnel which had retired to Morbecque was absorbed. Lost
or battle-worn equipment was immediately replaced, and in addi-
tion, a fresh issue of battle supplies left no one in doubt as to
whether the Battalion would participate in further fighting.
On October 10th the hutments at Vlamertinghe were
vacated and the Unit marched to a bivouac known as Hussar
Farm. Immediately on arrival all ranks set to work on the con-
struction of temporary shelters and in less than two hours, what
was once a bare strip of land was converted into a veritable
township sheltering between 600 to 700 men.
The date of the next attack was fixed at October 12th and as
on the previous occasion, everyone had been busy in the prepara-
tions for the event. Lieut.-Colonel C. H. Davis, D. 5.0., had re-
sumed command, whilst Major Hurry was temporarily detached
for Divisional duty.
Arrangements up to date were satisfactory, though it was
recognised that as the ground to be covered was low-lying, and
as so much rain had fallen the conditions would be such as to
test the grit and doggedness of the storming troops to the ut-
most.
The 38th Battalion was allotted the third or final objective
—a line beyond the village of Passchendaele. A New Zealand
Brigade and the 9th Australian Infantry Brigade were allotted
the ground respectively on our left and right. At 10.45 pm. on
the night of the 11/12. The approach march was begun. Soon after
entering “K” track enemy shell fire was encountered.
This shelling continued intermittently until the assembly
lines were reached making our casualties rather considerable,
-especially near the junction of “K” track and the sunken road.
In addition, gas shells fell on the low-lying ground north-
east of Judah House, but owing to the high velocity or the wind,
the effect was not marked.
By 3 a.m. the Battalion had formed up on its tapes in the
following order:
Two platoons of “A” Company (Captain Trebilcock) right,
plus two platoons of “B” Company (Captain Latchford) left,


formed the First Wave; “D” Company (Lieut. Maxwell) were
behind as “moppers up”; the remaining platoons of “a and “B '
Companies formed the Second Wave. “C” Company (Lieut.
Herring) as “moppers up” in rear.
While waiting for zero hour the enemy shelling was acute
and many casualties resulted, so that by zero hour the Battalion
had been weakened considerably in numbers; and those who
had survived had already received a severe handling.
The advance was commenced in rear of the 40th Battalion,
but soon heavy machine gun fire was encountered from the left
(Bellevue). One party, under Lieutenant Munday, worked its
way across the Rave Beek and cleared three pill boxes, but was
eventually stopped by heavy rifle and machine gun fire. They
dug in where they stood, and next night rejoined the main body,
which, in the meantime, had advanced to the Red Line, where
the 38th was amalgamated with the remnants of the 37th and
40th Battalions. Casualties had been so severe that further ad-
vance was impossible, especially as the New Zealand troops on
our left, through encountering belts of uncut wire, and suffering
enormous casualties had failed to get forward. Consequently
Major Giblin (40th Batt.) Senior Officer present, ordered a with-
drawal to approximately the jumping-off line where consolidation
was completed by 3 p.m.. In conjunction with the remainder of
the Brigade the 38th Battalion held this line until relieved on
the night of 13/14 by the 41st Battalion A.1.F., when the Bat-
talion moved to bivouacs again at Hussar Farm.
During the operation the Battalion Battle Headquarters
\v as established in a pill box in Berlin Wood, as also was the
Regimental Aid Post and Quartermaster’s Store. Transport
personnel and other details were camped in a field on the right
of the Ypres-Zonnebeke road.
Although actually out of the battle area this camp during
the pi ogress of the fight received a good deal of attention from
the enemy long-range high velocity guns, and hostile aeroplanes
which paid a nightly visit to the spot.
Oui casualties during the operation were very numerous.
The following officers were put completely out of action (i.e.,
killed or missing):—Killed: Lieuts. Robinson, Maxwell Mat-
thews, Morrison, Marshall. Missing: Lieut. McKenzie.

ro , rPe P , e , roe s lta I se of casual ties to the number engaged was
bl being the highest of any operation carried' out by the Bat-
taiion.
Despite the failure of the operation many deeds of heroism
were performed, the most notable on this occasion being the
Distinguished Service Order won by Captain G. V Davies the
Battalion Medical Officer.


The following is the quotation from the A.I.F. List No.
214: —“For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in going
forward through an intense barrage and establishing a Regi-
mental Aid Post in an advanced position, remaining on duty
continuously for fifty-four hours, often working in the open under
heavy fire. When the Aid Post was hit by a shell he extricated
a man who was buried and continued his work. He remained
for fifteen hours after the Battalion was relieved till the last
man was carried to safety, and set a magnificent example to
all.”
A Military Cross was awarded to Capt. Latchford for con-
spicuous gallantry and devotion to duty, in reorganising the
Battalion after it had suffered heavy casualties. In addition,
ten Military Medals were awarded for good wark in both opera-
tions (4th and 12th).
During the whole of the operations at Ypres and Passchen-
daele more so than during any other period of the Battalion’s
history, the one awful aspect which constantly presented itself
was that of mud!
As far as the eye could see, the whole countryside was
pock-marked with hundreds of thousands of shell holes of all
shapes and sizes, and not the slightest sign of vegetation was to
be seen anywhere, the earth having been completely churned up.
The shells had fallen so constantly and frequently that
eventually the existing holes had been, and were being, torn
open afresh and made deeper and larger than before. These
shell holes through soakage rapidly filled with water and con-
ditions were accentuated by the almost continual rain which
descended daily over this shattered area.
There was something terribly sinister and terrifying about
the mud of the Ypres and Passchendaele battlefields. Men
knew that if they fell wounded in one of those gaping holes they
stood little change of being rescued, that they would probably
be suffocated in the thick glutinous substance which gripped
everything which touched it like the tentacles of a giant octopus
seizing upon its prey. And this is actually what happened to
many a brave man—German as well as British. And yet, despite
everything, our men labored on with grim set faces and that
indomitable spirit which eventually won us the war. And the
animals were almost as dogged in their persistence.
Pack horses and mules carrying forward ammunition, en-
gineering supplies and rations would constantly tall into and
sink —sometimes out of sight—in the terrible mud of the shell
holes. Hours would be spent by the faithful drivers in an en-
deavor to rescue their helpless beasts, but very often the
animals were so helplessly bogged that there was no alternative
but to put an end to their struggles and torture by a revolver or
rille bullet.
The guns had to be supported on specially constructed plat-
form to prevent them sinking. When the time came to follow
the advancing infantry the artillerymen performed almost
superhuman feats, but even then not without guns and teams be-
coming hopelessly bogged when they got off their specially
prepared tracks.


During the Battalion’s operations at Ypres and Passchen-
daele it was quite a common occurrence for the men to sink to
their thighs and waists into the soft, slimy mud, which drew
one down, down, for ever downward like some live thing.
But still they endured and achieved what appeared almost im-
possible and bore their trials with a joke and a smile upon their
faces. And a word here for the heroic stretcher-bearers will
not be out of place. To carry a wounded man from the front
line to the R.A.P. was a terrible undertaking. The distance to
be covered was less than a thousand yards, but it took six men
fo.ur, five and even six hours to do the trip. Many a helplessly
wounded man through some of his bearers falling or sinking
into a shell hole, would roll off the stretcher and feel himself
being sucked down —and all this under constant enemy shell
fire. Truly the Heroic deeds performed at Ypres and Passchen-
daele have never been excelled!
After strenuous fighting under such adverse conditions the
Third Division was withdrawn for a rest. The 38th Battalion
left the battle area for the purpose of embussing at a point some-
where in the neighborhood of Vlamerringe. It was necessary
to pash through Ypres, and it was in the of that town
where further trouble was met. The enemy was shelling the
place with heavy long-range guns. Headquarters and “A” Com-
pany, who were in the lead received the full force of a shell
which killed Lieut. Kirkbride, Reg. Sergeant-Major Rust and
others. Captain Trebilcock and others were wounded.
Twenty-three casualties were caused altogether. In addition
many records were destroyed, including most of “A” Company’s
official records.
The remaining Companies got through without casualities.
and it was not long before the Battalion (all that were left) had
Started on their journey away from the scene of so much
desolation and ruin.

CHAPTER IV.
WARNETON TO THE SOMME.
On the loth October the Battalion moved by motor buses
to Senlecques, and was again warmly welcomed by its ola
fiiends. But many soldier faces were missed by the good French
folk:, who, with tear-filled eyes listened to the quietly-told story
of BiL> s oi Jack s * death on the battlefield of Ypres.
Once again the Battalion settled down to enjoy several
happy weeks in this neighborhood.
Summei had passed and Autumn was painting trees and
hedges with her gay brush. Training was carried out and kit
inspections were held when shortages of clothing and equipment
were replaced.


When the time came to again move up towards the line
the Battalion was greatly refreshed by this restful period.
Moving by* motor bus to the La Motte area on November
10th the Unit billeted for the night at Verte Rue and Cordescure,
and on the following day marched to Noote Boom in the Vieux
Berquin area. Hollybeque Farm was reached on the 12th.
After twenty-four hours’ rest the Battalion moved on to
relieve the Sherwood Foresters in the left battalion sector of
Warneton sector.
The first stage of the journey up to the line was an easy
one by rail from the Railhead Dump at Steinwerok Station to
Hyde Park Corner. But shortly after leaving the latter place
the Battalion’s troubles began. The night was particularly dark,
and duckboard tracks sadly needed repairing. The railway
track along which Captain W. H. Orchard led “D” Company was
in a vile condition. The continuous marching of troops along it
had worn deep hollows in between the sleepers, and these were
full of mud and water into which “D” Company splashed.
On arrival at the trenches the Battalion was reminded of
the muddy, water-logged defences of Houplines. The Warneton
trenches were in a fearful condition owing to bad weather, and
the previous occupants neglecting to make them habitable.
The eight days spent in the line were fairly quiet. During
this time the trenches were overhauled, and when on the 21st
November the Unit was relieved by the 40th Battalion there
was a marked improvement in the defences.
The Battalion retired to hutments at Romarin as a reserve
battalion. Here eight pleasant days were spent in a comfort-
able camp.
The surrounding country, despite its flatness, was not un-
picturesque. Here and there quaint old windmills stood out
against the sky with their red sails turning around and around
to the breezes. The open fields were dotted with red-roofed
houses, and the main roads could be traced by their avenues of
stately trees.
Working parties were daily employed unloading trucks of
shells at ammunition dumps, and on various jobs in the forward
area. A network of light railway lines was spread over the
country, and busy little engines continually hauled loads of am-
munition, building material, etc along to the various dumps, and
puffed their way through Ploegsteert Wood to within a mile of
the line. Tram tracks connected with the railway and ran
right up the trenches through a wilderness of shell holes. These
tracks were often shelled by the enemy and many a working or
ration party experienced exciting times while pushing the hand-
trucks along these bumpy but serviceable lines.
The puffing of engines and the rumbling of trucks could
be clearly heard by the enemy. On clear, frosty nights it must
have seemed to him that the busy little engines would come
puffing along into his trenches.
The Battalion again took over the Warneton sector on
November 29th. This time the enemy made things a little
livelier. His trench mortars pounded the defences from time to


time. Our Artillery constantly “strafed” him, with the usual
result —retaliation.
A great source of annoyance was the Tower,
which the enemy used for purposes of observation. This build-
ing was clearly visible from the trenches and stood out above the
town. The artilllery continually “strafed’’ it, but it seemed to
defy destruction.
Fi'om the tower the enemy commanded a splendid view of
the area and could watch any movement on the high ground on
the outskirts of Ploegsteert Wood. It was not until three months
later that it was destroyed by a naval gun whica was commis-
sioned to hurl tons of iron and high explosive at it.
Passing through Ploegsteert Wood, now denuded of foliage
by Winter, and lacerated by enemy bombardments, one’s
thoughts went back to the warm, sunny days of the month of
May, when Spring had glorified the flower-filled aisles of the
wood. Here was a striking illustration of the ugliness of war;
shattered trees, a charred stump where once a spreading chest-
nut had held up a canopy of green leaves and graceful pink blos-
soms; a giant oak split in two by half a ton of iron; deep ugly
gashes in the earth; grasses and leaves withered by deadly
gases. One of Nature’s choicest works converted into an un-
lovely wilderness.
On the 6th December the 38th Battalion was relieved by its
old friends of the 40th Battalion and retired to Red Lodge about
a mile and a half behind the line. Here it lived in dugouts ex-
cavated in the side of a hill; snug little homes, lit up with elec-
tric light and fitted with bunks.
The next move was to Aldershot Camp on the Waterloo
Road, a mile behind the town of Neuve Eglise, where iffie Bat-
talion was accommodated in hutments for five days ana on the
20th December retired to Hollebeke Camp (Jesus Farm) in the
Steinwei ch area. Here the Battalion spent its second Christ-
mas in France.
The "weather was bitterly cold. Heavy frosts and snow
covered the land with cold, white garments;' but around blazing
hies, when the cold was forgotten, Christmas was merrily cele-
brated. The Battalion cooks served up a fine Christmas dinner
which was thoroughly enjoyed.
1 ei naps some of the hardest workers in the Battalion were
the cooks. Up in the coldest hours ofthe morning, long before
dawn, they toiled away until midnight. When the Battalion was
m the line meals had to be prepared at all hours and often under
great difficulties and danger, but the cooks never failed under
the most trying circumstances to provide good hot meals. Great
praise is due to them for their splendid work. Good meals mean
contented men; well-fed soldiers are fighters. The 38th Bat-
talion cooks helped to win for their Unit fame and glory.
i x J h ° Hun was now boa sting to the world that he would
shbi tly sweep through Belgium and France with his “irresistible
stoim-troops which he stated would shortly be massed for this
ie Kaiser again adopted his favorite pastime of
™ Q ns wffißy patriotic speeches, extracts of which almost daily
appealed in the worlds newspapers. According to the Hun


the war would be quickly brought to a finish by his great onward
rush. Although his boasting failed to alarm the Allies every
precaution was taken to meet the threatened attack. Recon-
noitring parties from all Units proceeded to certain areas, where,
slightly in rear of the line, defences had been prepared in case
the enemy through.
A party of officers and N.C.O.’s of the 38th Battalion recon-
noitred the positions allotted to the Unit in the neighborhood of
Le Bizet. This work proved very interesting for it entailed
careful study of the features of the country. In case of an
enemy attack the Battalion would immediately go forward and
occupy these selected positions, led there by those who had
gained a thorough knowledge of the area.
Rations and water were stored close to the defences, and
every military necessity was gone into and arranged for with
great care and thoroughness.
On the last day of the year the Battalion returned to Aider-
shot Camp, where it remained until the 27th January. The
New Year ushered in stormy weather, which often interrupted
the work of training. Heavy rains flooded the camp for two
days, and working parties had a very miserable time. Follow-
ing the rain came heavy frosts and snow. The ground became
frozen to a depth of two feet. Twelve months ere this a system
of water pipes had been laid down in the neighborhood by
engineers. The pipes were only eighteen inches underground
with the result that the water in them froze. The Battalion
had the contract of taking them up and burying them at a depth
of five feet. Another unpleasant contract was digging cable
trenches. Owing to the heavy rains the low-lying ground was
in a waterlogged condition, the result being that water oozed
into the trenches as they were dug. Gumboots had to be worn
for the water often came up above one’s knees. Then, again,
where the ground was not quite so wet the walls of the trenches
had a nasty trick of falling in, so that a man’s daily task was
often doubled. Towards the end of this stay at Aldershot Camp
the weather became quite pleasant, when bright, sunny days had
a cheering effect upon everyone.
It was almost like a touch of Spring; the big “sausage - '
balloons floated lazily up in the sunshine and aeroplanes droned
overhead, looking like silver dragon flies. Towards evening
enemy 'planes would sometimes venture over to attack the bal-
loons. Immediately they were sighted the “Archies,” or anti-
aircraft guns would surround the balloons with a protecting
curtain of shrapnel, which the Boche would not venture to pene-
trate. Occasionally the enemy’s night bombing 'planes would
pay the neighborhood a visit, when searchlights for miles around
would sweep the heavens and once they fastened on an enemy
’plane it received a warm reception. The red flashes of burst-
ing “Archies” would wink about the ’plane, and phosphorus, or
Tracer bullets, would stream up through the night like long lines
of fireflies.
Captain A. Fraser, with a fine record of good work, was
on January 1 1918 awarded the Military Cross. Captain Fraser
had served in Gallipoli, where he was wounded. Returning to


Australia for a short time, he joined the 38th Battalion as
Adjutant and was finally, in February, 1919, promoted to com-
mand the Unit. Captain Fraser was one of a few who served
continually with the Unit during its sojourn in France.
On this date Lance-Corporal F. J. Perry was awarded the
Distinguished Conduct Medal for a continuous record of good
work as a scout.
In accordance with Battalion Order No. 57 the Unit relieved
the 23rd Battalion A.I.F. in the Warneton Sector on January
27th. The relief was complete at 9.15 p.m. The Battalion
moved from Aldershot lines to Connaught Siding, thence by light
railway to Hyde Park Corner, from where it once again trudged
along the duckboards up to the trenches. The relief passed
without incident, some of the members of the 23rd Battalion
being heard to remark that it was the quickest relief they had
ever had.
The dispositions of the Battalion were as follows:—In the
front line were two platoons of “A” Company and two platoons
of “C” Company. The remainder of “A” and “C” Companies
were in close support; “B” Company was in support in
Grey Trench, and “D” Company in reserve in the Catacombs.
B.H.Q. was established in an old pill box against the subsidiary
line. The Quartermaster’s Store and the Transport Section were
at Antrim Lines and Romarin Siding.
Owing to the bad weather experienced early in the month
the trenches were in a bad state. Useful Lane (a communi-
cation trench) despite its name was in places impassable. Along
M ally Support, and River Lane the mud was of such a sticky
nature that it was difficult to drag one’s feet out of it. The front
line was in the same condition.
During the stay in the trenches the weather was fine and
i emarkably mild thus making it possible for the defences to be
put in fair condition. The enemy’s artillery fire was almost
as mild as the weather, but his trench mortars were fairly active.
On being relieved on the 4th February the Battalion again
moved to Red Lodge.
Coming' out from the line, weary, loaded with gear, and
plastered with mud, a light shining out on the Messines Road
drew one like a magnet to an old tin shanty.
Here the Y.M.C.A. toilers had prepared steaming cocoa
whica was greedily drunk from condensed milk tins Biscuits
and cigarettes were handed out, and trudging on again, with the
glowing end of a “fag” illuminating the tip of his nose, many a
digger muttered, “Good old Y. Emma!”
At Red Lodge everyone enjoyed the luxury of a hot bath
and a change of clothing, both of which were badly needed after
spending eight days in muddy trenches
It was not a time of rest, for all available men were needed
frona'dayl^ht^to^dark 3^ *** employed “
<Uot *Am en , d ° f January (23rd) whilst the Battalion was
stationed at Aldershot Camp (Neuve Eglise) a party of five
officers and 100 other ranks was selected to commence training


with a view of raiding the enemy during a subsequent period of
duty in the line in front of Warneton. This party, together
with a similar number from the 37th Battalion, went to Romney
Camp, near Romarin, where, under Captain Fairweather, M.C.
(38th) they commenced training in earnest for the task before
them. Smartness in turnout and in drill was insisted upon from
the outset; physical training and bayonet fighting were made pro-
minent features; whilst careful attention was paid to such special
subjects as hand and rifle bombing, and also anti-gas training.
Practice in crossing wire both by day and night was given;
and later on the intended raid was performed more than once
over a model which was an exact replica of the enemy’s trenches.
Each night a proportion of officers and men went forward to the
line as reconnoitring patrols, so that, by the day of the raid,
every man was fully acquainted with the obstacles likely to be
encountered, and had a good idea of the features of the ground
over which he would be working.
A Special Party, under Lieut. Barker, was detailed to re-
ceive instructions in the handling of dummy figures, which were
to be used to deceive the enemy as to the exact point of the real
attack, thereby assisting the surprise effect and causing the
dispersal of the enemy retaliatory fire. This body was styled the
“Chinese Party,” and probably derives its name from the unpro-
gressive nature of its intended job.
The remaining members were divided mainly into two assault-
ing teams, operating respectively on the North and on the South
of the road leading into Warneton. Each of these teams was
divided into eight separate parties; and to each of these sixteen
parties was assigned a definite rule, task and objective. The
total duration of our occupation of the enemy’s position was to
be 26 minutes, and the total penetration, measured from his
front line, 250 yards on a total frontage of 500 yards. The left
team was comprised of 38th Battalion men, led by Lieutenants
Churchill, Eason and Schlitz (C.O left Assault) and the right
team was made up from the 37th Battalion personnel.
Whilst all these preparations were in progress arrange-
ments were being made by the Artillery and Machine Gun Com-
pany and Tiench Mortar Battery to afford as much assistance as
possible to the raiders. Programmes for the barrage (Artilery
and Machine Gun), counter battery work with gas and harass-
ing and covering fire were drawn up; and on “X” day—the day
prior to the raid —the wire was cut at various points along our
own Divisional front and that of the neighboring Division on the
north. The Lewis Guns in the line prevented any repair to such
gaps, and on the morning of “Z” day, as an extra precaution, a
further shoot by Trench Mortars was arranged. The thorough-
ness with which the arrangements for co-operation of all arms
were made is exemplified in the following account of the details
concerning them. —
“The Artillery will carry out an advancing barrage which
wall rest 100 yards beyond the furthermost point of penetration
and be maintained there until the close of the operation. In
addition the Reinforcing Brigade will keep under fire the enemy’s


front line to the northward of the point of attack. The Artillery
of the left flank Division will carry out a division bombardment
whilst Corps heavy artillery will bombard trench inter-sections,
which the enemy is likely to reinforce. Rear targets will also
be engaged.
In adufiion, the 10th Machine Gun Company and the 10tn
Trench Mortar Battery will carry out such work as an additional
barrage, covering fire and engaging such targets by harassing
fire as might be the assembly places or approach routes for
assisting enemy troops.”
The arrangements made for the maintenance of communi-
cation were such that information and reports were assured.
Telephone lines were to be laid between the officer in charge of
the raid and the two officers in charge of Assault, stationed
under the enemy’s parapet.
In the event of these being cut, runners had to be substi-
tuted. A power buzzer was installed, so that in the event of a
break in the wire in rear, messages could be sent without the
employment of the slow method —runners.
At 5.30 p.m. on “Z” night the raiders left Camp, entrained
at Connaught Siding (light railway), detrained at Racine Dump,
and then moved by Vancouver Track to Au Chasseur Cabaret,
thence overland to the factory by a taped route. By 9.56 p.m.
the parties had assembled in two lines of single rank with a
distance of 30 yards between lines, in the order in which they
were to enter the enemy’s trenches. So far, they had suffered
no interference. Friendly patrols were operating in No Man’s
Land to prevent any enemy observation.
All was quiet until, punctually at 10 p.m., the barrage came
down. The raiding parties paused for a full minute whilst the
“Chinese Party”, who were lying dQwn 400 yards to the north,
pulled the cords which raised the silhouette figures from the
ground. The trick had succeeded. Intense enemy fire, Machine
Gun and Artillery, was directed on to the dummy figures. Then
at zero (plus one minute) the parties moved forward to the
attack through the gaps marked on the map A and K respec-
tively. The passage through the wire was easy, but the first
opposition came early, for during the first minute of the hurri-
cane bombardment, the Boche had moved forward from his own
trenches to a zone of safety. There they met our advancing
parties full of dash, spirit and determination. In a short space
of time this resistance was overcome, and at least 30 of the
enemy were killed and some taken prisoner.
The left assaulting team (38th) met practically no opposi-
tion in the front line, but strong resistance in the second line,
where they found a number of dugouts affording protection to
the defending troops. They demolished three of these, so that
with the two which were already destroyed by artillery fire, a
considerable amount of damage was inflicted.
At 10.24 two minutes before the time for withdrawal—
a strong counter attack developed along the Warneton road, but
this was repulsed by rifle and Machine Gun fire, and the with-
drawal of our troops was thereby covered. The return journey
was made via The Factory, Vancouver Track to Racine Dump,


where the party entrained for Connaught Siding, thence home to
billets again at Romney Camp, to enjoy a hot meal which had
been prepared for them.
The result of the raid cannot be too highly estimated. When
one comes to consider the fact that at least 100 of the enemy
garrison had been killed (including one Company Commander).
33 taken prisoner, and much booty—three machine guns, one
trench mortar and medical equipment)—captured, together with
the amount of material damage inflicted he cannot but come to
the conclusion that the operation ranks as a brilliant success; in
fact, it is justly claimed that this raid was the most successful
ever carried out by the 38th Battalion. The results obtained by
our men in the face of strong opposition by a. resolute enemy
must compare favorably with any similar operation throughout
the Division, even in the whole Australian Corps.
Our casualties (38th Battalion), totalled six, making a per-
centage to the.number engaged of about 5.6.
Lieutenants Schlitz and Churchill were each awarded a
Military Cross for splendid work in the operation. In addition
the names of Pte. R. L. M. Geliy, Cpl. J. Wallace, Pte. J. Grant
and E. C. Umbers figured in the list of awards for Military
Medals for specially good work.
Captain F. E. Fairweather, M.C., who had charge of the
operation from the commencement of the training until the final
report, proved once again, by his thoroughness, courage and
skill, that he was a soldier of the highest quality and a most
successful leader of men.
The Warneton sector was again taken over on February
12th, when the 40th Battalion was relieved.
The relief passed without incident, and was complete at
8.15 p.m. The trenches were in a considerably better condition,
although there was a good deal of water in the front line, the
communication trenches and supports were dry. The Division
had seriously undertaken the work of improving the sector, large
parties of men being employed nightly under the supervision of
engineers and pioneers.
On the night of the 18th the enemy put down a heavy bar-
rage on the front, support, and communication trenches. This
was repeated at 2.15 a.m., 2.30, 4 and 5 o’clock. The trenches
were only slightly damaged, and casualties were light, two men
being wounded.
During the stay in the trenches the weather remained re-
markably fine, and an immense amount of work was done, so
that by the time the Battalion was relieved it was possible to
tour the whole of the front line wearing only ankle boots.
The relief took place on February 19th, when the Unit re-
tired to the Catacombs, Hyde Park Corner, as a support Bat-
talion.
The Catacombs was really an underground city, a network
of tunnels under a hill. These subterranean passages were fitted
out to accommodate about 1500 men, and here one could rest in


peace, and laugh at shells and bombs. Lit up by electricity
and fitted with bunks the Catacombs was quite a comfortable
place of abode.
On the 24th of the month the Battalion moved to “A” Camp,
Kortepyp.
The long-threatened attack by the Boche was expected at
any time and a Corps line was being garrisoned by A.I.F. Units.
The whole of “D” Company and selected parties from other
Companies of the Battalion took over ten (10) posts in this line
from February 24th until the Unit moved to billets in the
.Lumbres area on 4th March, when the Third Division was due
for a rest.
Arriving at Lumbres by train at nightfall the Battalion
marched to billets several miles out of the town; B.H.Q. and “A”
Company proceeded to Ardenis-lez Sheninghem, and “B”, “C”
and “D” Companies to Affringues. Very happy times were spent
in these delightful little villages. After a comparatively mild
winter, Spring was already peeping into the woods and fields
and weaving pale primroses and deep blue violets into the earth’s
new carpet. Warm sunshine flooded hill and vale, and had a
cheering influence. Training was carried out under happy con-
ditions, and, after weeks of trench life with its attendant strain,
physical and mental, this mild work proved a great tonic. On
certain days leave was granted, when motor "buses conveyed
happy parties to St. Omer and to Boulogne-sur-Mer. But, alas!
this restful and happy time was short-lived. Two weeks had
quickly passed when news came through that the enemy had at
last launched his long-expected attack. At this time one little
dreamed that he was to almost succeed in sweeping through
France.
So kits wei e packet, blankets rolled, and at dawn on the
23rd of March the Battalion left the peaceful little Villages to
commence a long, weary struggle of months of terrific warfare.
Lumbies was reached after an hour’s march, and here the
Battalion had to wait until 2 p.m. for the train which was to con-
vey it to Caestre. Trains were everywhere rushing troops to-
ward the line to stem the tide of grey-clad figures which had
flooded over it in many places. This sudden strain upon the rail-
ways had upset their daily programmes, and no definite informa-
ion regarding the train service could be given by railway
omciais.
Caestre was reached about 4 p.m. a long march lav
before the Battalion which had been ordered to proceed to
billets m Wmmzeele.
TT«it^l er , half . ] an . h . our ’ s march alon S a cobblestone road the

had ueeued^n! 1 7™ resu m edat dusk, and hours after the stars
ad peeped out trom a cloudless sky the long column still


tramped along cobblestone roads, through villages, and out into
the open country where lights twinkled from scattered farm-
houses.
Packs and equipment seemed to grow heavier and heawier.
and when at last billets were reached everyone was worn out
after a long, hard day of eighteen hours. In large barns, where
the farmers liberally supplied the travellers with straw, the Bat-
talion settled down for the night, and soon everyone was soundly
sleeping; “A” Company sharing a. large barn with French re-
fugees Avho had fled from Hazebrouck, which town was being
heavily bombarded by the advancing enemy.
At 3 o’clock in the morning the Battalion was instructed to
proceed to Wardrecques area, but this order was cancelled by
later instructions, and after breakfast a move was made to a
road junction slightly north of Wallon Cappel, where motor
buses were to pick up the Unit.
Orders of movements were frequently altered. The suc-
cessful break-through of the enemy had disorganised whole
armies, and from time to time the movements of battalions were
upset. The march to the place where the motor buses were to
be met was by a round about way of several miles. Orders were
issued that bodies of troops must not travel along certain main
roads. The result was that to reach a place half a mile distant
two hours’ solid marching might be necessary. This was the Bat-
talion’s experience ast Wallon Cappel, and was the subject of
much bitter criticism.
The buses conveyed the Unit to Campagne, where it
marched across from the main road into an open field, when
blankets were taken from packs and stacked in readiness to he
taken on to billets by the Transport Section. It was a< great
relief to be free to march on without blankets; one’s pack, equip-
ment and ammunition were certainly a heavy enough burden
without the additional weight of blankets.
Once again the journey was continued, a;nd after a hard
march of two and a half hours, the neighborhood of Coubronne
was reached, when Headquarters was established at Le Rons.
“B” Company billeted at Coubronne, and “A”, “C” aind “D”
Companies at Be Sablon.
The Battalion remained in these villages until 11.30 on the
following night, March 25th. This rest of over 24 hours was
badly needed.
Moving on again the March was to St. Omer railway station,
which was reached at four o’clock in the morning.
A disorganised train service kept the Battalion waiting for
fives hours in the vicinity of the station. It was a raw morning,
and, added to this heavy rain fell just before daybreak and
soaked through the thickest overcoats.
Three Companies, ‘A”, “B”, and “D”, entrained for the
South at 9 a.m. “C” Company was to follow by a later train.
At that time it waes not known to what place the Unit was pi’o-
ceeding; probably to Doullens, it was thought.
But at four o’clock in the afternoon the Battalion detrained
at Mondicourt. Here the Railway Traffic Officer stated that
enemy armoured cars were but three miles away. The roads
were choked with an unending stream of traffic coming from


the direction where the enemy was supposed to be. Refugees
were fleeing with what possessions they could take with them
and many a pitiful sight touched the hearts of men used to the
callousness of war.
Along the dusty road an old woman would be leading her
cow; a young mother fleeing with her babe and a small bundle
of clothes snatched together in a few frenzied moments of terror
when the news came that “the Allemand was coming”; an old
lumbering dray piled up with mattresses and house furniture, a
middle-aged woman with a large family of frightened children
clinging to her bedraggled skirts. Along the roads, dodging in
and out among motor lorries, cars and artillery waggons, these
poor, homeless people turned their faces towards strange towns
and villages, not knowing where their next meal was to come
from or where they should rest their wearied bodies when night
came.
Such scenes the Battalion witnessed on the march to
Authie, and they caused men to grit their teeth and press on to
meet those who were the cause of such misery.
Marching on, large bodies of retiring troops were met;
many were disorganised and leaderless, and one seemed to read
the word defeat in the dejected faces. An atmosphre of de-
pression seemed to enwrap the country, and passers by flung
back fragments of disquieting, but as it was afterwards discov-
ered, wholly unreliable news. Here discipline was put to the
test. Worn-out by days of marching and lack of rest the Bat-
talion was pushing on to meet the enemy while others were re-
tiring in disorder, and informing the Australians that they would
soon be doing likewise. It seemed that they alone were to face
the advancing hordes. What a temptation to turn back and join
the disordered Units! What chance had a mere handful of men
against the massed divisions of Germany. No doubt, such
thoughts occupied the mind of every man of the Battalion. Men
cursed the heat, the dust, and the heavy packs. What a relief
it would be to throw the latter aside and retire. But they
marched on with dogged persistence.
And yet the Australians have been dubbed an undisciplined
lot! Here was the true test of discipline, perhaps the severest
ever put upon men, who cursed but “carried on.”
At 7 p.m. Authie was reached. The only indication of the
enemy’s presence was that aeroplanes were dropping bombs in
the neighborhood.
By eight o’clock the Battalion was settled down in billets,
and, after a drink of hot tea everyone (with the exception of
the scouts who were scouring the neighborhood for any signs
of the enemy) crept into their blankets.
Scarcely it seemed, had one fallen asleep when the order
came to “stand to” ready for pushing on again. This was at 2
a.m., and after a scratch breakfast had been swallowed by those
lucky enough to get it, the march to Marieum was commenced.
Arriving at this place at 5 a.m., the Battalion embussed for
Franvillers, which was reached at 1.30 p.m.

CHAPTER V.
STEMMING THE GERMAN TIDE.
Forming up in a field, orders were awaited for the next
move. Half a mile away enemy shells were raising clouds of
dust. Ordered to push on to Heilly the Unit immediately pro-
ceeded to that town by platoons at 200 yards intervals. Here
it was reported that the enemy had reached the vicinity. Moving
forward in open order the Battalion crossed the green fields
lying between Heilly and Mericourt l’Abbe. At the latter place
previously selected positions were taken over from the 43rd Bat-
talion A.I.F.
There was no sign of the enemy, and by nightfall “A” and
B” Companies had established a defence line beyond Mericourt
l’Abbe railway station, “C” Company being in support and “D’
Company in reserve.
At 8 a.m. on the following morning, March 28th, Captain F.
E. Fairweather, M.C., pushed forward with “C” Company and
occupied Marrett Wood, about 1000 yards beyond the main line
of defence. From there the enemy was observed in force upon a
distant ridge, and his machine guns played upon the positions
taken up in the wood without doing any harm.
Shortly afterwards he advanced down the side of a hill
in four waves, about 100 strong, and moved towards the wood
evidently bent upon capturing it.
But the attack was quickly beaten back by rifle and Lewis
Gun fire, the enemy suffering 50 per cent, casualties.
The survivors retired as quickly as possible over the hill.
After this futile attack the day remained comparatively quiet
(except that artillery fire increased) when the positions in the
wood were consolidated as much as possible. The only artillery
support was one battery of eighteen pounders, which on
account of the activities of its gunners, must have caused the
Boche to think that there were several batteries around Meri-
court. Into this town he poured a number of heavy shells, and
shelled the neighborhood at random.
The night of the 28th March passed very quietly, except for
occasional machine gun and artillery fire. The Battalion’s
casualties for 24 hours, from noon of the 28th to noon on the
29th, were two N.C.O.’s and nine other ranks wounded.
Strict watch was kept upon the hills and ridges scarcely a
mile beyond the lines of defence. At any moment a sea of
grey figures might swarm down them, and rush the positions
held by mere handfuls of men. If it succeeded in breaking
through there was nothing to block its onward rush to Amiens,
for there were no troops in support of the several Australian
Brigades defending a wide front.
Early in the morning of the 29th a patrol of two N.C.O.’s
and fourteen men, under Lieut. G. E. Fitzgerald, moved out to
reconnoitre a hill in front of Marrett Wood (near Treux), “C”
Company’s position, to find out whether it was occupied by the
enemy. Very soon a party of Boche, about 40 strong, was
surprised in a sunken road a few hundred yards out from the
wood. This party was immediately engaged by oblique Lewis


Gun and rifle fire from a few yards range, and in a minute or
two was mown down. About forty casualties were inflicted,
and three prisoners were secured by the patrol. No further
signs of the enemy’s whereabouts could be discovered.
Between the occasional disturbances caused by enemy
shells a' brooding silence seemed to settle over the woods and
hills. These were disquieting days. Just where the enemy
would launch his next attack no one could say. In what strength
he might be massing behind the near skyline no one could ven-
ture to surmise.
On the 30th March, four days after arriving at Mericourt,
“A” Company took over Marrett Wood from “C” Company, the
latter retiring to the village for a few hours’ rest. This change
over took place about mid-day. Scarcely had “A” Company
entered the wood when enemy shells crashed into it, heavy
shrapnel being frequently used. Two officers, two N.C.O.’s and
five men were wounded, and Pte. Marion was killed. During its
occupation of the wood, “A” Company had an exceptionally rough
time, having to bear the brunt of the enemy’s shelling.
The next move by the Boche took place on the following
day. when the 11th Brigade, on the right, was attacked. Wave
after wave of German Infantry swept onward, but the assault
was heavily repulsed, and the attacking troops collapsed under
the withering fire of machine guns and rifles.
The fearful punishment which all attacking parties received
on this front must have broken the confident spirit of the enemy,
and he, no doubt, began to realise that his advance was being
effectively checked.
By this time spirits had been raised by the roaring of the
3rd Division artillery which had hastened to the assistance of
the infantry. Batteries, from eighteen pounders upwards, now
narked viciously and poured their salvos of screaming shells
into the enemy territory.
Our aeroplanes and those of the enemy were now actively
searching for batteries and troops with the result that many
thrilling battles were fought in mid-air.
On the last day of the Unit relieved the 39th Bat-
talion in forward positions, when trenches hastily dug a few
days before were put in better condition. Weather conditions
since arriving in this sector were far from being good. Heavy
rains fell from time to time and men were wet through for the
trenches, as yet, afforded no protection from the weather.
By the 2nd April enemy artillery and machine gun fire
ha.d increased, but the movements of enemy troops had de-
creased. Evidently he had got into fixed positions and secured
some shelter. The Battalion’s snipers were kept busy, for the
enemy would often show himself, jumping from post to post.
Many hits were claimed by the snippers, and scouts brought in
an enemy machine gun and also many documents and other spoil.
On the 3rd April there was a marked increase in all activities of
the enemy. Near Morlancourt he was using seven observation
balloons. At night he was now using Verey lights and
night flares, and was putting up wire.


The Battalion sector was now greatly improved. Outposts
•were nearly all connected and some wire entanglements were
constructed, and the digging of a communication trench was
commenced.
On the night of April 3rd the Unit was relieved by the 40th
Battalion, the relief being accomplished systematically and with-
out interference by the enemy. The Battalion retired to Ribe-
mont, about a mile and a half from Mericourt, when it became
known as “D” Battalion.
On the following afternoon a warning by wire was received
from Brigade Headquarters of the possibility of an enemy
attack. German prisoners captured stated that their troops
were already in position for the event, so our artillery opened
up on his posts and probable points of assembly, and for three
hours maintained a heavy fire. The night passed quietly and at
5 a.m. all our artillery fired rapidly on enemy posts and possible
places of formation. At 7 a.m., enemy heavy guns commenced
counter battery work in an attempt to neutralise our field guns
east of the village. A great deal of shelling ensued, but our
guns remained in action throughout the artillery battle. Gas
shells were frequently used by the enemy, but only a faint trace
of gas reached Ribemont.
At 7.50 the shelling lifted to the village and the cross
roads. The vicinity of “C” and “D” Companies billets and
Headquarters was heavily bombarded for 60 minutes. Only
slight casualties occurred, for troops took to cellars and dis-
persed over the fields.
At 8.50 the bombardment lifted west toward Heilly, but
intermittent shelling of Ribemont continued all day. Everyone
was retained at billets as the enemy was attacking the front line,
but as he was beaten off no movement was necessary on the
part of the Battalion. While in reserve working parties were
almost daily employed digging strong posts in the neighborhood
in case the Boche should break through. Owing to enemy ob-
servation training could not be carried out, but the Scout Officer
organised the scouts and gave lectures on their work, under new
and unusual conditions of semi-open warfare; and the Signalling-
Officer organised signallers for the next relief of the trenches.
On the night of 6th April the Battalion took over the
trenches in the Buire-Treux sector. The relief was carried out
without enemy interruption during heavy rain. On the follow-
ing day Buire village was shelled, but its garrison was housed in
cellars and no casualties occurred.
The Acting C.O. (Major Hurry) spent the day in the front
line viewing the dispositions, which it was decided, were not
the best possible, and a scheme for their improvement was sub-
mitted to higher authority. This scheme was immediately ap-
proved and steps were taken to commence the wiring and dig-
ging of new posts.
On the eighth day of the month the troops were fully
occupied in improving defences and endeavoring to obtain a
tittle comfort and shelter from the inclement weather. Enemy
artillery was still very active. The Battalion snipers and Lewis
Gunners were kept busy although there was not much enemy


movement. Observers drew the attention of the artillery upon
a party of the enemy which was observed. The artillery shot
accurately and the party, 90 strong, dispersed from huts in
which it had been encamped.
When night came the 38th Battalion advanced a portion of
the line on a front of 700 yards, constructed new posts, and
placed out wire; this was done by “A” and “B” Companies. The
scouts of “B” Company executed a daring patrol to a distant
objective and obtained close touch with the enemy and brought
back documents and Verey lights from enemy dead.
Next day the enemy harassed the area with shell fire. Be-
tween the hours of 8.30 and 9.30 a.m. he distributed over a
thousand shells on Buire and Treux villages, and on the railway
line held by the Battalion. Owing to a misty atmosphere the
day was favorable for an enemy attack, and the shelling seemed
to indicate this intention; but the enemy infantry remained in-
active and the shelling continued all day, varying considerably
in violence.
At 9 p.m. the Unit was relieved by the 40th Battalion when
it moved back to Mericourt and occupied support trenches and
became known as “C” Battalion. Battalion Headquarters was
established in a chateau in Artillery Row, Mericourt.
Although rations as usually issued were on a somewhat
limited scale and lacked variety, the conditions of their issue
reflected very creditably on the work of the Quartermaster
(Lieut. P. J. Telfer) and his staff, and also on that of the Trans-
port Section. Rations were cooked and prepared at the Quarter-
master’s Store at Heilly. The vessels containing the food were
then packed in straw-filled boxes and carried on limbers to the
front line area, being issued to the troops in pleasant variety
and satisfying quantity; two hot meals being given, one before
daylight, and one after dusk, as transport was impossible during
daylight.
Trench feet had been prevented by the daily exchange of
soiled, wet socks for clean dry ones. Although no laundries had
been instituted in this as yet, unorganised front the Quarter-
master had secured by salvage and other means a surplus of
socks which were washed and dried at the store and issued daily
in exchange for soiled pairs.
The activities of March 11th were those of artillery and air-
craft on both sides. Four enemy balloons were observing from
the vicinity of Morlancourt. Defences had been further improved
by wiring and entrenchments, and the area was rapidly becoming
organised in depth.
On April 12th the Battalion relieved the 40th Battalion
astride the River Ancre. “A” and “B” Companies occupied the
tront line left of the river, and “D” Company was on the right
bank and parallel with it to a post astride the Buire-Ville-sur-
Ancre road. “C” Company was in reserve in Buire, and Head'
quarters was established in an old farm house in a wood, known
as the Haunted House.
At 4 o clock on the morning' of the 14th, “A” Company’s
patrol of six men encountered an enemy patrol, eight strong,
neai a disabled tank 400yds east of the line. The enemy threw


two grenades, which slightly wounded four men, a,nd then scat-
tered, apparently escaping the rifle fire of “A” Company’s
patrol.
The front was now firmly established and while it was quite
possible that the enemy might make an attempt to break
through, everyone was confident that it would be beaten back
and prove a disastrous business to the Boche. His artillery was
continually active, and at intervals shells were poured into the
villages of Buire and Treux.
It was in the front line about 100 yards out from the latter
village that a very popular officer of the Battalion (Lieut. T. H.
Kennedy, M.C.) was killed by a shell on the 15th April.
On being relieved once again the Unit retired to Ribe-
mont. During the four days in the line 350 yards of new wire
was put up and 250 yards of existing wire was strengthened;
280 yards of new trench was dug.
The next five days were busy ones when much work was
hone on rear defences.
The days which followed until the Battalion moved back to
rest billets in Allonville were strenuous ones. The Unit had two
more trips into the line. Every day and night the enemy bom-
barded the villages now slowly, but surely, becoming mere heaps
of ruins.
But only with his artillery did the Boche succeed, for his
troops were never to set foot upon the soil held against such
great odds in those first weeks when his advance was effectively
checked.
When at last the sector was taken over by the 21st Bat-
talion A.1.P., on 9th May, it was a body of tired, nerve-racked
men that retired to the peace and quietude of the delightful
little town of Allonville.
Here it seemed Spring had prepared a welcome for all, for
the village gardens and the surrounding fields and woods were
a source of delight.
The hours of morning were spent in mild training and the
afternoon was devoted to recreation. Delightful walks through
the flower-filled grounds of a large chateau, and quiet hours
spent in the adjacent woods or open fields, proved a wonderful
pick-me-up, and within a few days the strained look was missing
from the faces of those who had been tested almost to breaking
point.
On Sunday morning, 12th May, Church Parade was held in
the chateau grounds where the songbirds added their voices to
the singing of hymns.
After the parade there was a presentation of medals by
General Sir Wm. Birdwood.
On Tuesday, 12th, the 10th Brigade was inspected by the
Commander-in-Chief, Sir Douglas Haig.
The day was warm and sunny and the Brigade’s turnout
reflected great credit upon it. At the conclusion of the inspec-
tion Sir Douglas thanked the Brigade for the wonderful work
it had done in helping to check the enemy’s advance.


On the 18th May a Brigade Transport Competition was
held, with specially-selected judges from Divisional Staff. The
38th Battalion Transport Section won first prize for all events,
which consisted of:
(1) Complete Section turnout.
(2) Best pair of heavy draught horses and cooker. (Driver
A. H. Shapland).
(3) Best pair light draught horses and waggon. (Driver S.
McCorkell).
(4) Best pair mules and waggon. (Driver IT. R. Box).
The judgment was based on the general turnout as to ap-
pearances, care bestowed, and grooming of animals, etc., no
points being given for type or particular excellence of animals,
and to win under these conditions reflected the greatest credit
on the general work of the section.
Several eagerly-contested football matches were held during
the stay at Allonville and drew large crowds of enthusiastic
supporters.
About three miles across the fields lay the City of Amiens,
where the world-famed cathedral towered above the city’s build-
ings. Enemy shells occasionally crashed into the old town, now
deserted by its inhabitants. Amiens attracted enemy night-
bombing ’planes which on two occasions passed over Allonville
to receive a warm reception from the Battalion’s anti-aircraft
Lewis Gunners. On the second visit of the aeroplanes a big
Gotha, finding Allonville district two warm a place, turned and
fled after dropping his load of bombs in the Chateau grounds.
Unfortunately one bomb fell near the 10th Field Ambulance,
killing a corporal and wounding others.
After two weeks’ rest at Allonville the Battalion moved up
to a reserve area in the vicinity of Biangy Tronville to take over
from a battalion of the 4th Division. The march was a fairly
stiff one, for the day was inclined to be hot, and the roads were
very dusty. Towards the end of the journey it was seen that
this new area should prove a very pleasant place, for the
Somme Canal, with its clear running water, promised good bath-
ing. By midday the four Companies of the Battalion bivouaced
in the vicinity of the railway line.
Headquarters was at the cross roads a few hundred yards
distant; rear B.H.Q. being at Biangy Tronville.
After everyone had settled down in dugouts and had a
refreshing meal, the canal was visited and here in the clear
water running between an avenue of shady trees, a delightful
afternoon was spent; swimming, diving and pulling about in old
punts.
On 24th May, Lieut.-Colonel C. H. Davis, D. 5.0., was pro-
moted Colonel to command the A.I.P. Base at Le Havre. Major
G. Hurry, D. 5.0., Acting O.C. of the Battalion, was promoted
temporary Lieut.-Colonel to command the Unit. Lieut.-Colonel
Hurry vas an extremely popular officer; a clear-headed, fearless
man who was always keenly interested in the welfare of every
individual member of the Battalion.


It was with mingled feeling of regret and happiness that
the Battalion said farewell to Colonel Davis —regret because it
was losing its C. 0., the C.O. who had guided and led it through
the most arduous period of the Battalion’s existence, and happi-
ness because, though it realised that he was leaving, his de-
parture meant the assumption of duties which would give
greater scope to his brilliant organising ability.
All ranks had long since learned to appreciate the value of
the fine pioneering work achieved by Colonel Davis. The work
of organising the training and of equipping the Battalion for war
had all been carried out by him, with the result that on landing
in France the Battalion presented as perfect a piece of fighting
mechanism as could be found in the British Army. The care,
indefatigable energy and solid hard work —both physical and
mental —required to discipline and train ai mob of eager but un-
trained, undisciplined, unmilitary men for the serious business
of war, is alone known to those few. comparatively, who have
had that onerous duty thrown upon their shoulders.
During the period of training—often necessarily irksome
and trying—one was apt to limit his perspective and wonder
why certain things, to the lay mind (i.e. the mind of the trainee)
obviously unnecessary—should be ordered by the C.O. But he
knew. He could see further than the Battalion, and it was not
long before the Unit profited by the precepts and teaching of
Colonl Davis. And the long months of weary trench warfare,
the merciless trench raids so often carried out by the men of
the 38th: the bi’illiant operations at Messines; the nightmare of
Passchendaele; the strenuous arid nerve-racking experiences
at Warneton and elsewhere, and then the rapid transition to the
Somme campaign—all of which were performed under Colonel
Davis —had taught all ranks what they owed to one who might
justly claim the title of “Father of the Battalion.”
But his successor—Major Hurry, as he then was —was a
worthy heir in every respect to the legacy left him by Colonel
Davis, and had the Battalion been asked to choose its new C.O.
the selection would undoubtedly have fallen upon Major Hurry.
The stay in the neighborhood of Blangy Tronville was not
altogether a time of rest, for the enemy strafed the area from
time to time with high explosive and shrapnel, when “A” and
“B” companies were often compelled to leave their dugouts and
disperse in the open fields.
Working parties were supplied for cable-burying in the
forward area, and members of the Battalion will have lively re-
collections of the nights spent in the neighborhood of Abbe
Wood. The work was constantly interrupted by the eiiemy,
who poured salvos of shells, high explosive and gas, into the
field across which the cable was being laid.
At 9.30 on the night of 27th May the Unit moved by platoons
at 300 yards intervals to Pioneer Switch and occupied a trench in
that vicinity. This was done on instructions from high authority
in order to support the 9th Brigade A.I.F. in case of an attack by
the enemy which was daily expected on this front. While march-
ing up to take up positions for the night the roads were heavily


bombarded with gas shells when the Battalion had a lively
passage. The night passed quietly, and at 6 a.m. the Unit moved
back to Blangy Tronville.
The Battalion Echelon was situated in a wood near the vil-
lage of Lamotte. While a battalion is In the vicinity of the line
a certain percentage of all ranks remains in a back area. The
reason for this is in case a Unit should, by the misfortune of
war, be annihilated, there still remain members of that Unit
upon which to build up another strong body.
On the fourth day of June the Unit relieved the 42nd Bat-
talion in the front line of Villers-Bretonneux. The relief was
completed at 1 a.m., and was without incident except that three
casualties were sustained.
Villers-Bretonneux! What a medley of thoughts the name-
of this town conjures up in the minds of those who have lived
among its ruins. Shattered houses whose tottering walls often
fell to pile heaps of mortar and bricks upon the roofs of cellars,
thus making them safer places of habitation, shattered houses,
and yet upon their broken walls clung photographs of the mem-
bers of families who once resided there in peace and happiness;
furniture —cheap or expensive—in this house undamaged, in the
next smashed to matchwood; rooms littered with clothing,
dainty feminine wear which seemed to have no place amid such
scenes of devastation and brutality.
Happy homes wrecked beyond repair by devilish shells.
Verey lights going up in the night, and gaunt, distorted
buildings silhouetted against their radiance. Bullets peppering
the walls; night bombers droning overhead; the crashing of
bombs and shells.
Villers-Bretonneux! occupied for one day only by the Boche,
if you excepted his dead still lying in several of the cellars.
Here for eight days “C” and “D” Companies occupied the
front line just beyond the town, and “A” and “B” Companies the
support trenches connecting up with cellars.
Enemy artillery and machine guns were very active and the
trenches and town were from time to time subjected to heavy
bombardments. Working parties engaged in digging trenches
linking up outposts were continually interrupted by enemy fire.
A small orchard seemed to be a centre of considerable enemy
activity, there being at least three light machine guns in its
vicinity. During the night of 11th June the enemy searched
the whole of the forward area with one or two guns. Probably
the working parties had disturbed him, and he feared an attack.
These days in the line were, indeed, trying ones; days of
uncertainty, when death lurked among the ruins of the houses,
and walked through the trenches.
In the support line, occupied by “.A” Company, several of
the old boys of the Battalion laid down their lives and their com-
rades quietly carried them away for their long rest.


The Battalion was relieved on the 12th June, “B” Company
remaining in Villers-Bretonneux for special work under the con-
trol of the 40th Battalion, and the remaining companies moving
back about a mile and a half to points on the railway line; Bat-
talion Headquarters was established at the monastry in Bois
I’Abbe.
During the next six days working parties were employed
in the forward and reserve areas, the main work being done in
the front line.
The trenches were again taken over on 18th June. This
second time of occupation of the line passed in much the same
way as had the previous.
The Orchard still remained a centre for enemy activity,
although rifle grenades were proving very effective in'silencing
the machine guns. Enemy artillery was fairly active. On the
night of 20th June it was estimated that over 300 shells fell in
the forward area.
Four officers and ten other ranks of the American forces
were attached to the Companies for several days to gain experi-
ence in line work.
On 23rd June the Battalion was relieved and retired to the
neighborhood of Blangy Tronville. and three days later moved
back to bivouacs in a wood near Allonville which was reached
just before nightfall. On the following day companies were
thoroughly overhauled in matters appertaining to clothing and
equipment when damaged or lost articles were replaced.
Next morning, 28th June, a move" was made to bivouac on
an embankment on the Hallue River, just beyond the town of
Querrieu.
This new camp proved a most delightful spot. Just below
the embankment with its snug little dugouts lay the river, and,
here and there, fine swimming pools gleamed invitingly among
acres of green rushes. The surrounding fields were ablaze with
scarlet poppies, and warm sunshine flooded the land.
Not for long after the arrival of the Battalion did the swim-
ming pools retain their calm surfaces, for after a hot,dusty maich
everybody made for the water.
Happy days followed. Training of a mild nature was carried
out in the mornings, but in the afternoon all were free to spend
the hours as they pleased. Cricket matches were held, and one
whole day was devoted to a Battalion sports meeting, when prize
money was donated from Regimental funds. 1 his day was a
most enjoyable one. The sports were held on a green flat whic li
proved an ideal running ground. The weather was pleasantly
warm and a neighboring swimming pool proved a side attraction
in between the events. On one night the peace and quietness of
the camp at the river’s edge was rudely disturbed when enemy
’planes heavily bombed the vicinity. For several disquieting
minutes the big Gothas hovered over the river and bombs
crashed among the trees, their explosions shaking the dugouts
along the embankment as volcanoes of flame leaped up from the
ground. Happily no one was injured, and on the ’planes passing
on to another area the camp was soon wrapped in sleep.


On the evening of Bth July a “stand-to” was ordered by
Army Headquarters. Immediately all was rush and bustle.
“Marching Order” had to be fitted together and valises packed.
The Battalion was in battle position by 9.18 p.m.—the first bat-
talion of the Division to be in position.
The Unit regretfully bade farewell to the Hallue River on
11th July, and marched to bivouacs, which were taken over from
the 14th Battalion A.I.F. Resting until dusk and then moving
on in accordance with orders to a forward area., the Unit passed
through the town of Corbie about eleven o’clock to occupy re-
serve trenches about two miles beyond the town. These trenches
(which lay among wheat fields) were in very good order, having
good dugouts. Here a stay of six days was made. During that
time the’ area was subjected to a great deal of shelling, and anti-
aircraft gunners were kept busy by enemy ’planes.
On the night'of 17th July the Battalion took over the front
line and supports from the 39th Battalion beyond Vaire Wood on
the right of the village of Hammel from whence the Boche had
been driven back a fortnight previously by American and Aus-
tralian troops.
The line was taken over under adverse conditions as a
Brigade on the right was also “taking over” a portion of enemy
territory to straighten the line. The natural result was that
the enemy strafed all along the line, fearing a general attack.
Unfortunately a number of “D” Company became casualties
while moving up through Vaire Wood. Upon the occupation
of the trenches the scouts immediately made a reconnaisance
of the line to decide upon the positions for outposts, and inciden-
tally discovered an enemy post in a German communication
trench near Accroche Street. The accommodation in the trenches
was found to be inadequate, necessitating night working parties.
Every night, parties were engaged digging new trenches and
outposts, and protecting them by the erection of barbed wire
entanglements. Some very lively times were experienced while
on this work out in No Man’s Land, and when back in the com-
parative safety of the trenches. The enemy strafed the defences
from time to time with high explosive and high velocity shells of
a small calibre, commonly known as “whizz-bangs.”
The latter shells had a nasty knack of skimming (so it
seemed) just above the parapets, and their sudden swish! swish!
swish! would quickly cause one to duck down well below ground
level.
A story is told in “Aussie,” the Australian soldiers’ maga-
zine, of two “Diggers” who were sent scurrying off to their dug-
outs by a shower of “whizzbangs.”
When in the seclusion of a strong dugout one said to the
other: “Did you hear that first one?” “Did I hear it? Cripes!
I heard it twice. I heard it as it passed ME, and I heard it
again as I passed IT on my way to this funkhole.”
Battalion Headquarters, which was situated in a donga
below Central Copse (behind \ r aire Wood) also received its
share of “whizzbangs.”


The weather was mild, but thunderstorms were constantly
brewing, and heavy downpours of rain caused inconvenience and
discomfort in the trenches.
The moon was approaching the full and was likely to out-
line parties working nightly out in No Man’s Land. At 1.30
on the morning of the 19th Captain Selleck, O.C. “C” Company,
was shot by a sniper while visiting an outpost. His death was
a great loss to the Battalion, for he was a most capable officer.
On one occasion “A” Company had a rather disconcerting
time, being strafed from the front and rear. This was due to
our artillery and machine guns firing low.
The Unit was relieved on 25th July, when it retired to a
gully behind Vaire Wood.
If you climbed the surrounding slopes, risking odd' shells
and an occasional sprinkle of machine gun bullets, a fine view
could be had of the country stretching away to Amiens. The
fields were everywhere gay with summer flowers. Patches of
scarlet poppies and blue seas of cornflowers colored the land.
About two miles away the massive twin towers of Corbie Cathe-
dral rose above the town and its surrounding woods. The
Somme wound its silvered way among the woods and hills, and
far away in the west the stately spire of Amiens Cathedral
gleamed like a needle. No doubt the enemy watchers beholding
the spires and domes of that coveted city must have realised
that their wild dream of conquest was losing its rosy hues and
was slowly fading. Everywhere along the line his attacks had
been repulsed, when his losses had been enormous.
Soon the Allied armies were to sweep down upon him and
steadily press him back to, and beyond, that line from where in
March he had swept onward to all appeaa’ances victorious.
Already there were rumors of a big push in the near future,
and by the time the Battalion again occupied the trenches beyond
Vaire Wood, special parties were reconnoitring the area, and on
still nights the rumbling and clattering of tanks could be heard
as they trundled along to take up secluded positions where
they could not be observed by the enemy. By sth August troops
were thickening up behind the line, so the day of the attack
could not be far away.
At last word came through that the great event so carefully
planned would take place in the early hours of Thursday, Bth
August, to be known as “Z” day, and that the 10th Brigade would
form the support brigade of the 3rd Division, which was attack-
ing on this front. A few hours before the attack the troops
holding the front line were withdrawn to positions behind Vaire
Wood, and their places were taken by attacking troops, 33rd and
34th Battalions A.I.F.

CHAPTER VI.
THE GREAT OFFENSIVE, AND THE BATTLE OF
PROYART.
A thick mist making conditions for attack favorable en-
shrouded the land when the first glimmer of dawn cast a faint
light over the area. Zero hour had been fixed for 4.20 a.m. when
as one gun the artillery for miles along the line opened out upon
the enemy.
Never will that moment be forgotten. The sudden roar
from thousands of steel throats; the swish! swish! swish! of
thousands of shells rushing down upon the Boche followed by
the “drumfire” of the guns, whose crews, bared to the waist,
toiled to feed the ravenous breeches. Every now and then the
heavy booming of big naval guns back in the woods near Corbie,
rose above the staccato notes of the eighteen pounders and
howitzers. The lumbering tanks moved out from their places of
hiding and waddled across the trenches to lead the Infantry.
Imagine the enemy’s terror when suddenly awakened by
that tornado of shells mercilessly smashing his defences, and
then, when the barrage lifted back, to behold the tanks looming
up through the mist like the monsters of a nightmare, crushing
everything in their way to matchwood, and spitting death from
their iron loopholes through which were thrust the muzzles of
machine guns, and between and behind the tanks the infantry,
cool and determined, advancing with fixed bayonets. That was
quite enough for the Boche; rifles were thrown down, equipment
stripped off, and up went their hands, and with lusty cries of
“Kamarad.,” they tried to make themselves heard above the
clattering of the tanks. On went the tanks and infantry, and
the Boche passed nervously through them, prisoners to make
their way to the rear, where they were collected in groups and
marched away to the Prisoners of War cages.
Fritz had been caught napping. Even his gunners were
were asleep in dugouts when our artillery opened out. The
result was that several minutes elapsed ere his guns opened out
in a feeble reply. Aeroplanes had marked the positions of many
of his batteries, the majority of which were quickly silenced by
our gunners. Old machine gun posts in rear put up a half-
hearted resistance, but these were quickly put out of action by
the tanks and the infantry that passed on practically without
opposition.
News of their success soon came back. Accroche Wood,
Tailloux Wood, and other enemy strong points had been taken.
An advance of a thousand yards had been made, and they were
steadily pressing on and were likely to drive the enemy back for a
distance of six or seven miles. Overhead aeroplanes were
watching their progress, swooping down out of the mist every
now and then like giant bats, and dropping ammunition and
rations if required. Occasionally a German ’plane would be
observed, to be quickly driven off or brought to earth by the
guardians in the air. And in the neighborhood of Vaire Wood
where the 38th Battalion awaited the word to push on, men


noAv walked about in the open in those places where a few hours
previously enemy shells had crashed from time to time and the
sibilant hiss of bullets had been heard.
When you have lived for days in trenches continually sub-
jected to shell fire it is with a strange feeling that you climb out
of those trenches and walk with absolute safety along their
parapets. Somehow or other they don’t seem to be the same
trenches. Here is the little “bivvie” in which you crouched last
night when “whizzbangs” made you hold your breath for a few
long moments. Now you sit on the parapet above it, and
smoke a cigarette. Yesterday had you been offered six months
“Blighty leave” to sit there for 30 seconds you wouldn’t have
taken the risk. Last night there was an air of mystery lurking
in No Man’s Land. Perhaps a few nights ago you cautiously
crawled out into it with the scouts while bullets hissed in the
grass at your side. Now you calmly stroll over this area where
gay poppies nod saucily in the sunshine. Somehow or other
you didn’t expect to find flowers blooming here. Yesterday
flowers would have seemed out of place in No Man’s Land. But
they were there all the time, calmly lifting their faces to the
sky. At 4.30 p.m. the Battalion commanded by Major A. J. A.
Maudsley pushed on to Hamilton Valley.
Although the move forward was a rather tiring affair (for
the afternoon was warm, and everyone was loaded up with gear
and ammunition) it was, perhaps, the most interesting march
the Battalion had had for many a long day. Naturally, all were
curious to see the effect of the morning barrage. That the Boch
had been caught napping was soon seen, for in a gully
several of the enemy dead were found in a state of undress.
Those behind his line who had fled before the attack had left
most of their personal belongings behind them in their haste to
get away from the tanks and the infantry. Crossing the fields
all sorts of odds and ends were picked up, one man finding an
Iron Cross carefully wrapped up in tissue paper.
Several of our tanks had been put out of order by enemy
shells and were stranded in the fields, and squatting there is
frog-like attitudes.
Far away over the eastern horizon an enemy balloon was
peeping up and evidently directing a high velocity gun which
occasionally sent over a nine inch shell to raise a cloud of dust
and smoke in the wheat crops traversed by the Battalion.
The dawn of August 9th found the Unit fairly comfortably
bivouaced in Hamilton Valley. How all ranks appreciated the
freedom from the restraints of trench warfare! Lieut.-Colonel
Hurry was missing the consummation of his, as well as every
members’, desire, that of getting Fritz well and truly in the open.
The Colonel, owing to sickness, had left the Battalion, bitterly
disappointed at the trick Fate had played him. Knowing his
thoughts were with them, all hoped to play up to his fighting
standard.
After holding the trench line facing Accroche Wood for
six weeks this move into enemy territory had wonderfully re-
vived the spirits of all.


The 10th A.I.F. Brigade during the ensuing operations was
to come directly under the orders of the 4th Divisional Com-
mander acting as his reserve Brigade.
Early on the morning of the 9th, instructions reached Bat-
talion Headquarters that an officer from Headquarters
and each Company must push forward and reconnoitre the left
of the established line held by the 16th Battalion
A.I.F. from the Somme, west of Mericourt-sur-Somme.
This was satisfactorily accomplished, but unfortunately the Bat-
talion’s possible position was altered to the right half of the line,
held by 14th Battalion, necessitating another move forward, the
outpost line being approximately 4500 yards from Hamilton
Valley. No wonder those doing both trips slept well, although
before retiring to their several “funk holes”, desci’iptions of the
9th Brigade and Americans’ attack north of the river, for the
purpose of clearing the village of Chipilly and establishing in
front of Etinehem Wood, was freely discussed. Those out with
the 14th Battalion had a grand view of the combination of tanks
and infantry in attack, and saw what grand assistance is a
shrapnel barrage put down by eighteen pounders.
Unfortunately, various “Diggers” of the 38th Battalion
pushed forward from Hamilton Valley to view this attack, and
from the 14th Battalion outposts were plainly visible to the
naked eye, the result being that Fritz opened upon them with
a high velocity battery, and sent them scurrying back to the
shelter of the valley.
Although the nights were sharp, the days were bright and
warm, that of 10th August being similar to the Australian early
Autumn.
The result of the reconnaissance showed the enemy to be
holding in considerable force a line running from Etinehem
through Mericourt-sur-Somme, bending south-east towards Fram-
erville and Vauvillers.
About 10 a.m. the Acting C.O. was called to a conference at
Brigade Headquarters, situated at the south end of Hamilton
Valley. At 2 p.m. the C.O. called together Company Com-
manders and explained the operation projected. The intention
was that the Brigade, accompanied by six tanks and an attached
Light Trench Mortar Battery and machine guns, was to make a
night march along the main Warfusee Road into enemy territory
as far as Avenue Cross, and then turn north following the road
line to Chuignolles, junctioning with the 9th Brigade that was
making a night attack through Etinehem to secure the spur
running south to the Somme.
Night signals were arranged, two white lights in quick suc-
cession when established on the anticipated line to be answered
by the northern force when also established. Unfortunately,
these were never fired by the 10th Brigade. The object was to
cut off a known large enemy occupation together with a valuable
enemy dump known as La Plaque dump.
I he 37th Battalion was to be on the left of the projected
line, on their right, 38th Battalion; while on their right again
was to be the 40th Battalion; the 39th Battalion to be in the
front line as support.


At 5 o’clock on the morning of the 11th an advance was to
be made from the front line, and the enemy force was to be
sandwiched between this and the projected line to be held by
the 10th Brigade.
Simultaneously the 6th Brigade was to push forward through
Framerville and Rainecourt, linking up on the right of the 10th
Brigade. Great assistance was to be expected from the artil-
lery, the task of the heavies being Chuignes and the steep valley
running south-west from that village, as a concentration of
Boche artillery had been located there. The only reconnissance
for this operation was that from aeroplane reports and armoured
cars that had made a dash out from Harbonnieres through
Framerville and back.
The portion of the projected line to be held by the 38th Bat-
talion was practically parallel with*the road running from Chuig-
nolles to Framerville, extending from the corner of Robin Wood
to a little distance south, the 40th Battalion continuing the line
to Avenue Cross.

The Battalion moved from Hamilton Valley at 6.30 p.m.,
working forward in artillery formation led by Headquarters Com-
pany, followed by “A” Company (0.C., Capt. F. E. Fairweather,
M.C.). “B” Company (Capt. L. J. Beattie); “O” Company (Captain
H. Dench); “D” Company (Capt. W. H. Orchard, M.C.), the start-
ing point being the road junction where the tanks were to join
up. It was intended that the head of the column pass the starting
point at 9.30 p.m., but owing to the long twilight the hour was
postponed until 10.30. The order of the movement was three
tanks, accompanied by Battalion scouts at the head of the 37th
Battalion, which was in the van. The 38th Battalion followed by
40th Battalion, also accompanied by three tanks with 39th Bat-
talion in rear. The tanks,, owing to the darkness, could not
venture from the main road, so clancked along at the head of the
column at the head of each half brigade.
How many times during the night of the 10th curses were
flung in their direction it would be difficult to enumerate. The
38th Battalion passed the starting point at approximately 10.45
p.m. It. was a beautiful starlight night, peaceful but dark, and
hardly such as would stimulate a murderous operation, though
late/the hurricane bombardment which descended was sufficient
to whip up even the most sluggish.
The tanks at the head of the 37th Battalion could be heard
rumbling along, advertising the approach through No Man’s
Land.
Trouble commenced on reaching La Flaque dump, in enemy
territory; machine guns firing in the direction of the tanks
sounds. The Battalion was protected on both flanks by flank
guards. Lieut. Baxter commanding the right, and the Scout Sgt.
Cpl. Stanbury the left, a group of Battalion scouts —moving under
Lieut. Dutton at the head of “B” Company in the main column —•
to come into operation when established on the projected line.
The enemy machine gun fire increased in intensity as the
column gradually “concertinaed” forward.
On crossing the La Plaque cross roads the enemy shut down
on the column a barrage. It was hell let loose. Luckily there
were ditches along the roadside affording a fair amount of pro-
tection from the hail of assorted projectiles "which tore down
upon the road with the fury of a thousand devils. So heavy was
ihe fire that the column, after reaching a point approximately
000 yards short of Avenue Cross, was held up, again seeking
cover in the roadside ditches, while the tanks, in an aimless
manner, slowly trundled from place to place, swept by showers
of bullets irradiating their steel sides like swarms of fireflies!
To add to th e column’s distress low-flying Hun ’planes were
bombing and machine gunning, during which additional enemy
attention the Light Trench Mortar Battery section attached to
the Battalion lost limber, team and ammuniion.
Towards midnight the enemy’s furious blast subsided, al-
ough the tanks, utterly useless in the dark, were still attracting
machine gun fire. Word came down the column to the effect that
le eading Company of the 37th Battalion had been decimated
and that the Unit’s Commanding Officer, Lieut.-Col. Knox-Knight,

LEADING
TO CURLU.




had been killed. Major Maudsley thereupon temporarily assumed
command of the column, until Major Payne of the 40th Battalion
was apprised of the situation when he took command.
Orders had been issued to the 37th Battalion to retire, and
to effect this the 38th Battalion opened out astride the road.
While rushing “D” Company up to move out into line with “B”
Company its 0.C., Capt. Orchard, in the darkness stumbled upon
a bayonet which penetrated his leg causing him to be evacuated
as a casualty. Lieut. Poole assumed charge of the Company.
It was a difficult matter to sight trenches in the darkness
and obtain an idea of the enemy’s positions. By 2.15 a.m. the
Battalion had dug in sufficiently to make a determined stand.
About 2.30 a.m.a memo, arrived from Brigade Headquarters to
the effect that the 20th Battalion would attack at 4.30 a.m., to
link up with our own supposed right at Avenue Cross.
This necessitated “C” Company, who had dug in south of
the main road, evacuating'and digging in as a support company
in rear of outpost companies. When entrenched, the Battalion
outpost line extended until it was linked up on the left with the
40th Battalion, continuing the line across the tram line. The
general line faced the north-east.
The steadiness of the personnel of the Battalion was re-
markable under such trying circumstances (those first wild
moments would quickly have proved chaotic with undisciplined
troops), and many excellent examples of coolness and courage
were displayed. The tanks retired at 3.30 a.m., which was the
signal for a further Hun outburst.
The Battalion Headquarters was now situated in a cellar at
La Flaque cross roads. This spot was a particularly hot corner,
being constantly under heavy shell and machine gun fine. When
a shell took the end out of the building it was considered advis-
able to move, Headquarters being established in a Boche dugout
at La Flaque dump.
Ration parties from the companies rendezvoued at the dump,
where rations were delivered hot by the transport.
A heavy fog enveloped the countryside when morning broke
on the 11th, and when the 20th Battalion went forward at 4.30
a.m. the roar of the artillery shut off all other sounds. Gas
drifted over the area, and the fog held it down, necessitating the
wearing of gas masks for a considerable time.
By 6.30 a.m. the 20th Battalion had come up in line on the
right, although there was a gap of 700 yards between the 38th
Battalion’s right post and their left. “C” Company, under
Capt. Dench was instructed to move south of the road and cover
this gap; but about 7 a.m. a platoon of the 19th Battalion moved
along the main road and formed a post along the south side, “C
Company extending beyond them. A machine gun section moving
with the 20th Battalion was sent forward to cover this gap till the
redistribution of the outpost line was accomplished.
As the fog gradually lifted it showed that “A” Company had
dug in within 20 yards of a Boche strongpost. Privates T. G.
Williams and J. W. H. Allit fired upon it until a white flag was


displayed, when they rushed the post which yielded one officer r
two N.C.O.’s and 15 other ranks as prisoners; another officer had
been killed.
Privates Williams and Allit were afterwards awarded the
Military Medal.
Later on a post of fourteen Boche surrendered to “D” Com-
pany, the surrender being due to the bravery and daring of
Lance-Corporal J. G. Lewis and Pte. E. A. G. Smith, who hopped
out of the trench and rushed the post, the determined rush of the
gallant pair causing the Boche to “Kamerad.” Their reward was
also the Military Medal. Thus two dangerous nests of enemy
machine guns were wiped out.
This latter operation of securing prisoners attracted the at-
tention of the enemy, who opened out machine gun fire from the
direction of Proyart on their own surrendering men, probably as
a warning to other posts which m.ght be contemplating a sur-
render.
The day was spent in shell holes and short trenches. These
positions were shelled from' time to time by a high velocity gun,
the speed and weight of the projectiles giving the impression that
the area was being bombed from above.
The night of the 11th passed in busy vigilance and work, the
line being advanced and new outposts dug, strict watch being
kept against enemy interference. Machine gun fire" was now
very intense, but it was remarkable that there was very little
shelling. Enemy ’planes were very active, dropping bombs in~
descriminately over the whole area, favoring their own trenches
as well as ours.
Twas ludicrous to behold the enemy’s lights going up when
a bomb was dropped in his area. Our own posts adopted these
tactics and secured a certain amount of immunity.
In the evening the Battalion was treated to a sideshow, a
gorgeous firework display, when our artillery blew up a Boche
Verey light dump. Firework displays along the enemy lines were
common occurrences, for on the slightest suspicion of an attack
vari-colored rockets would illuminate the area under suspicion.
But on this occasion the blowing up of the Verey light dump, all
previous displays paled to insignificance as box after box of gold,
green and red lights soared skyward to burst with a radiance
which put the sunset to shame.
The machine gun fire which had been intense throughout
the night had completely ceased an hour before dawn. Platoon
commanders in the front line put their heads together, and a mes-
sage sent to the O.C. of “A” Company, Capt. F. E. Fairweather,
M.C., speedily brought him to the spot. The Boche had evidently
moved back; everything seemed to indicate it. On that supposi-
tion Captain Fairweather issued orders to No. 3 Platoon, under
Lieut. C. H. Peters, M.C., to move out on a fighting patrol with a
distant objective—Robert Wood, and Lieut. Schlitz, M.C. with a
patrol to investigate posts along the main road.
The patrols were only out five minutes when No. 1 Platoon,
under Lieut. D. Addison was also on the move.


With three Platoons in front and one in the rear “A” Com-
pany commenced the move which was to redeem the failure of
the night of the 10th, and establish the Battle of Proyart as a
Tenth Brigade success.
The Company advanced over undulating country, the scouts
inspecting crops and protecting the flanks until after some casu-
alties from machine gun fire from front and both flanks. Captain
Fairweather established a line on a crest, when some rudimen-
tary French trenches were occupied.
By this time the whole Battalion was on the move.
“C” Company made a most successful foray, a platoon fight
when Lieut. F. H. Baxter and a party rushed a post, killing seve-
ral of the garrison and taking the remainder prisoner. For his
-courage and daring Lieut. Baxter was awarded the Military
Cross.
“B” Company took up a position in support, and “D” in
reserve, and by the time the Companies had settled down in their
new positions the whole Brigade was on the move.
From their coign of vantage “A” Company could look on and
beyond the town of Proyart, and witnessed the stout resistance
put up by the Boche against the 37th and 40th Battalions, particu-
larly in Proyart and the dense wood beyond the town. Parties
of the enemy were observed from time to time, and were dis-
persed by rifle and Lewis Gun. About midday the enemy com-
menced a bombardment of the area with an assortment of shells
ranging from “whizz-bangs” to nine-point two’s This bombard-
ment lasted until well on in the afternoon.
After nightfull, when all were worn out after a hard, hot
day, came the cheering news of an early relief, and on the arrival
of the 7th Battalion of the East Yorks, an impressively fine body
of men, the Battalion moved back along the m-ain road through
scattered shelling to the old bivouacs in Hamilton Valley.
Among those who had laid down their lives in the fight for
Proyart was Lieut. H. McColl, a well-known Bendigonian.
The 10th Brigade’s daring attempt to cut off the enemy at
Proyart had proved a splendid failure; an adventure entered upon
with an “Aussie’s” love for chance, and a reasonable assurance of
success; a splendid failure which led to an ultimately successful
operation. The enemy had suffered heavily, in lives, prisoners,
and the loss of machine guns, and undoubtedly, the daring of the
Australian at Proyart caused him to fear more than ever the
nerve-racking and irresistible attacks which the “Diggers” con-
tinually launched upon him, driving him back, and gradually sap-
ping his spirits, which were now in a very weak state. Knowing
how badly the Boche had been punished and demoralised it was
with no feeling of defeat that the 38th Battalion retired to
Hamilton Valley, which was reached in the early part of August
13th. The day was spent in rest, so necessary after the stren-
uous days at Proyart. After a refreshing sleep a pic-nicing spirit
prevailed. After a “stunt” the first impulse in these days of
summer was to toss aside heavy clothing and 101 l about in the
shade in short white underpants and open-necked shirts. The
clear waters of the Somme proved a great attraction, and hot
baths, if preferred, could be had on the river bank.


Perhaps the best reward for the work done at Proyart was
an Australian mail and a large number of parcels which arrived
towards evening.
A stay of nine days was made at Hamilton Valley. Train-
ing of a mild nature was carried out in the mornings, and the
afternoons were devoted to recreation, and bootmakers’ and
tailors’ parades.
Enemy bombing ’planes visited the area nightly, and
dropped bombs on the chance of their falling in the gullies used
for horse lines.
CHAPTED VII.
THE FIGHTING FOR BRAY, CURLU, CLERY-SUR-SOMME
AND ROISEL.
On 21st August the Battalion received orders to move to
an area north of the Somme. The move was made that night
in bright moonlight, and the route followed led through Cerissy,
crossing the Somme at Chipilly, along the road into the Somme
Valley to Sailly Laurette, and then north-east along the Morlan-
court Road. The move was completed by one o’clock in the
morning.
Here training was resumed for two days when a notifica-
tion was received on 23rd that the Brigade would that night
take over the line from the 9th Brigade.
The 38th Battalion took over the front line from the 33rd
Battalion. “C” Company (Capt. Dench) was on the left; “D”
Company (Lieut. Poole) on the right; “A” Company (Lieut.
Addison) and “B” Company (Capt. Beattie) were in support.
On the following day the enemy commenced machine gun
and artillery operations in the early hours of the morning and
throughout the day heavily “strafed” the front line area from
the direction of Mamits.
At 6.45 a.m. Capt. Dench of “C” Company, while bravely
organising a stand on his left flank, where ground had been
given by the 19th Division, was killed by a sniper.
On 24th August, the 37th and 40th Battalions pushed on
through Bray and established posts east of the town, the 38th
Battalion, right flank, conforming to the movement. Boche, in
numerous parties, were observed opposite the Battalion front
just forward of Ceylon Wood, commanding observation of all
movements.


That night the Unit was relieved, when a move back was
made to bivouacs, the_Unit becoming reserve Battalion to the
10th Brigade in its attacks for the acquisition of high ground.
During the whole of the day the Battalion was subjected to
intense artillery fire—-all calibres of shells from 77 m.m. to 9in.
being rained upon the area held by the Unit. The shelling
began at 4.30 a.m. and did not slacken until 8 p.m., when it
developed into the usual desultory shooting. The casualties for
the day included one officer and five other ranks killed, and
three officers and fifteen other ranks wounded.
On 26th August the Battalion moved forward, when “A” and
“B” Companies pushed on, coming under control of 37th Bat-
talion, ‘B” Company being sent forward to extend the line east
of Suzanne to the River Somme.
During the early hours of the night “A”, “B” and “C”
Companies moved on to mop up the peninsula and establish a
line and clear Royal Dragoons Wood. This work was accom-
plished without enemy opposition, and “A” Company established
bridge head guards te Eclusier and Frise crossings.
The series of bridges connecting up with Curlu had been
demolished by the retreating Boche, but were later repaired by
the Third Australian Pioneers.
Work was received that the Battalion was to be relieved,
but the relief was cancelled later in view of further hostile
action by the Division.
Instructions were received from Brigade that the Battalion
would work as a separate Unit under its Acting C. 0., Major
Maudsley. This necessitated a slight readjustment of Bat-
talion dispositions.
The morning of 27th broke with light drizzling rain. Artil-
lery, during the last 24 hours, had moved well up into position
in Maricourt Valley, near Suzanne.
Patrols from “A” Company crossed the river at Eclusier
and got into touch with the First Division; “’C’ Company estab-
lished a bridge head post guarding Vaux Bridge; and “B” Com-
pany captured, near Suzanne, a light minenwerfer and a heavy
machine gun and carriage.
At 7.30 a.m. on 28th “B” Company was ordered to cross the
river ,at Vaux Bridge and reconnoitre the peninsula on the
opposite side of the river crossing. By noon the Company
could be distinguished moving well out to the canal. The work
of clearing the peninsula was accomplished with little or no
interruption by the enemy, but at Frise bridgehead the Company
had a lively time, coming under the fire of our own eighteen-
pounders./
“C” and “D” Companies then moved out to attack from
the line established by the 9th Brigade (it being stated that they
Had established a post slightly forward from Curlu towards the
river) “D” Company moved through and on to the south of
Curlu. As soon as this Company entered the town it met strong
opposition, which was only subdued by determined and stubborn
fighting on the Company’s part.


During this action heavy casualties were sustained, but
the Company succeeded in establishing a post 150 yards east of
a bridgehead, the party chiefly responsible for the result being
the platoon commanded by Lieut. Poole.
During the advance the Company inflicted many casualties
on the enemy and captured four machine guns.
Through the night an advance was made, and later a fur-
ther advance of 200 yards, was made by the whole Battalion,
without opposition to an old line of German trenches to the east
and in advance of Observation Wood.
In the early dawn of the 29th patrols pushed forward from
the Companies and reconnoitred ground forward from Curlu. In
Plindleg Wood an old German Headquarters was discovered. By
midday they had captured the village of Hem, a mere heap of
ruins, and were well on their way to Monacu.
Orders were given for a move on Clery-sur-Somme, the
Battalion moving out at 11 a.m. in artillery formation covered by
a troop of 13th Australian Light Horse.
From right to left were “A” “D” and “C” Companies, the
right flank being the river, and the left flank of advance pro-
tected by the 40th Battalion, doing a flank guard. As the
advance commenced the enemy put down a heavy curtain of
shell fire, inflicting casualties, Lieut. Dutton, Lewis Gun officer,
being killed.
The advance was continued along a ravine running east,
which was lightly shelled. After a mile had been accomplished
the Battalion came under heavy machine gun fire from three
guns firing from the north. Here the cavalry screening the
infantry suffered many casualties. Riders had their horses shot
under them by the withering fire of the machine guns, which
temporarily checked the advance, the infantry being forced to
occupy a series of old trenches.
Pushing on again, after having obtained the assistance of
the artillery, the attackers went over the brow of a hill which
commanded a view of Clery, from where fire from eight machine
guns caused another halt. These in their turn were dealt with
by our own guns.
Again the Battalion advanced, and when crossing the rail-
way line in a depression near Clery was heavily shelled.
The town was entered at dusk, two companies passing
through it, searching for hidden Boche in the half light, and
then pressing on to entrench for the night on an arranged line.
The other companies then pressed on to this line east of
Clery, the left flank being east of Copse 58, the line running
towards the river.
The Unit had been fighting for 84 hours, and everyone was
worn out. With the arrival of rations, a good hot meal, spirits
revived, and everyone settled down for a much-needed rest, the
37th Battalion having passed on to continue the attack.
Since 2 p.m. on August 26th the Battalion had secured by
fighting a depth of 9000 yards from the enemy. Holding ground
won, and acting as reserve Battalion to the Brigade, the Unit
awaited orders for the next move.


At 7.30 on the evening of 30th August, Battalion Com-
manders were called to a conference to discuss the continuation
of the attack, the objective of which was the trench system
running N.W. The dispositions for the attack were, 38th Bat-
talion to be on the right, the 39th on the left, to take over from
37th Battalion. Throughout the day and night the Battalion was
subjected to heavy shelling and machine gun fire. The move to
relieve the 37 th Battalion and continue attacking was completed
by 4.20 a.m. on 31st, when the Battalion settled down to await the
barrage which was to commence at 6 a.m.
The final instructions for the attack were received by
Company commanders at 5.25, having been received from
Brigade Headquarters as late as 3.30 a.m. At 5.30 the enemy
opened up a heavy shoot on the front line and valley.
At G o’clock the Battalion advanced under a barrage and
when within 50 yards of the trenches just vacated, strong enemy
opposition was encountered, and much hand-to-hand fighting
ensued. Very destructive machine gun fire came from the direc-
tion of Clery Copse, and it was here that Corporal (now Ser-
geant) A. V. Grinton won the Distinguished Conduct Medal for
courageous work on the left flank. With a few men he rushed
an enemy machine gun and captured its gunners, thus saving a
weak flank heavily attacked. He also helped a composite patrol
that captured three pieces of enemy field artillery, eight machine
guns, and killed numbers of enemy, finally capturing 25 un-
wounded prisoners
The enemy troops which the Battalion encountered were
Queen Augusta’s Grenadier Guards, who, it was said, volunteered
in Berlin to come up and stop the advance of the Australians.
But the swift and determined advance of the “Diggers” un-
nerved the Guards who quickly “Kameraded.” There was one
Australian to every ten yards, and through them the crest-
fallen Guards passed, as prisoners, literally in hundreds.
It was noticed that they all wore brand new uniforms and
equipment, which showed that they were new troops.
On swept the Battalion, down a hill and into \an Trench
and up over the next hill to Berlin Wood. The objective (The
Red Line) Inferno Trench, Zombo Trench, Morava Trench, was
reached at 7.15 a.m.
Numbers of the enemy were found in several trenches, but
they gladly surrendered, having no desire to fight. Scarcely
had the new positions been consolidated when a warning was
received of a counter attack on the left flank by about 120 of
the enemy.
A party from “C” Company formed a defensive flank and
fire was opened out on the attackers, who took to trenches.
Again they came on, attempting to bomb their way through,
but were 'heavily repelled, and the survivors retired through
trenches to the opposite hillside.
Shortly after the Battalion had reached its objective, Lieut.
Baxter led a patrol forward about 800 yards, and with Lewis Gun
fired upon a German field piece, killing its crew.


Parties of the enemy observed him and attempted to cut
■off the patrol by outflanking it, thus forcing his retirement. For
this cool and courageous work Lieut. Baxter was awarded a bar
to his Military Cross, won at Proyart.
The Battalion was now holding a line from the Canal-du-
Nord on the south to a trench junction.
Many heroic deeds had been performed to win through to
the objective, and many casualties, both killed and wounded, had
been sustained. Major A. J. A. Maudsley, Acting C. 0., had
been killed by a bursting shell, at 6.30 a.m., the control of the
attacking Battalion then falling on the shoulders of the Acting
Adjutant, Lieut. H. R. Robbins, who shouldered his manifold
duties with promptitude and ability. At 10 a.m. word had been
received that Colonel R. O. Henderson, D. 5.0., commanding the
39th Battalion, would take the dual command of the two Bat-
talions (38th and 39th), but the Colonel, just recovering from
a bout of influenza, had virtually to allow Lieut. Robbins to carry
the direction of the 38th Battalion on his shoulders. It was for
this and other fine work that Lieut. Robbins was afterwards
awarded the Military Cross.
Two other officers to win the Military Cross were Lieuts.
J. F. Eason and N. W. W. Sandiford.
Lieut. Eason had a few days earlier rushed a machine
gun post on a bridge crossing the Somme at Curlu, and by a
determined dash he and his platoon captured two guns, one
light and one heavy.
Lieut. Sandiford, who took over the command of “B” Com-
pany when Captain L. J. Beattie was wounded, completed the
task of clearing the peninsula between Vaux Wood and Feueil-
lers, and later on, at Clery, on August 31st, led his Company to
its objective and there consolidated, and although wounded re-
mained on duty for 12 hours, until finally he was forced by ex-
haustion to give in and evacuate the firing line.
At 11.30 p.m. word was received that the Unit would be
relieved by the 43rd Battalion moving through at 5 o’clock next
morning, September Ist, under the protection of a barrage. In
the meantime the enemy was heavily shelling with gas and
high explosive, both on the hill and in the valley in rear. Bat-
talion Headquarters was at this time situated in Van Trench
on the forward slope of a ridge overlooking Berlin Copse.
The 43rd Battalion passed through the 38th Battalion at the
arranged time and disappeared in the heavy fog and mist of
the morning.
The relief was through in the forward area at G. 30 a.m. the
barrage having prevented “A” and “B” Companies from moving
out at an earlier hour.
Ihe Battalion moved back to bivouacs in the vicinity of
Curlu, where the Rev. Prank Hanlon and his Y.M.C.A. staff" had
toiled through the night in preparation for the coming of the
worn-out fighters. Hot cocoa, biscuits, and cigarettes awaited
them, and later on a good hot meal was served up by the Bat-
talion cooks after which everyone settled down for a well-earned
and much-needed sleep.


Four days were spent in this area in rest, cleaning up, and
reorganising as a fighting Unit, and on the evening of sth Sep-
tember, in accordance with an order from Brigade Headquarters
the Battalion moved forward. En route a heavy thunderstorm
swept down upon the long column (enveloped in clouds of dust
disturbed by heavy traffic on the roads) and in a few minutes
everyone was wet through. The roads soon became very slip-
pery. and hundreds of heavy motor lorries, unable to make any
progress up the slippery inclines, held up the transport traffic
for miles back. By 8 p.m. the Battalion reached bivouacs,
everyone’s spirits being damped by the weather and the uncom-
fortable march.
On the following day advance parties from Battalion Head-
quarters and Companies moved forward to reconnoitre the
forward area held by the 11th Brigade the line battalion of which
was then fignting for Tincourt. All the villages and camps on
from Clery-sur-Somme had been systematically destroyed by the
retreating Hun, and many “Booby traps” had been discovered
by various Units. “ ’Twas wise to be wary” in this area. A
half-closed door of a building or dugout if opened might explode
a mine. To an innocent-looking shovel stuck in the ground
might be attached a fine wire, perhaps covered with earth, con-
necting up with a few pounds of high explosive. The Boche
had always been noted for his sunning; he was devilishly cun-
ning when it came to setting “Booby traps.” And so every pre-
caution was necessary when passing through or occupying his
late positions..
On 7th September the Battalion moved on again ready to
take over the line held by the 41st Battalion. The outpost line
was supposed to run east of Roisel and Heiwilly.
Moving on to take up this line the Battalion’s progress was
not impeded by the enemy. When passing through Roisel the
town was heavily shelled, but no casualties were sustained; and
when crossing Cologne Valley the enemy shelled that neighbor-
hood. Here and there villages were burning (fired by the Hun)
from whence dense columns of smoke curled skyward.
The guides supplied by the outgoing Battalion lost their
direction and it was not until 4 a.m. that the relief was com-
pleted. L'ieut.-Colonel Hurry. D.S.O. (38th Batt.) commanded the
vanguard troops, comprising which were 37th and 38th Bat-
talions, A.1.F.; 10th Australian Light Trench Mortar Battery,
two sections of 10th Machine Gun Company, and one troop of
13th Australian Light Horse, supported by artillery. The 37th
Battalion operated on the right, 38th Battalion on the left; the
right flank of the British Division operating on our left was the
24th Welsh Regiment. On the right flank was the 29th Bat-
talion A.I.F. The 38th was responsible for approximately
3000 yards frontage, the 37th Battalion for 2500 yards.
At dawn on the Bth it was found that the Blue Line had
not been occupied by the relieved Vanguard, and orders were
issued by the C.O. to gradually push forward to the outpost line
under the protection of the Light Horse. This was successfully
accomplished by 9 p.m., the enemy’s scattered machine gun fire
scarcely interfering with the movement. The 40th Battalion
then moved through and established a line in an old trench


system running north and south, the 38th Battalion then auto-
matically becoming support battalion to the vanguard.
The dawn of September 9th ushered in a bleak wind which
throughout the day caused much physical inconvenience, the
troops being without blankets and packs.
Next day advance parties from the Ist A.I.F. Division visited
the area to take over the operations of the vanguard, the 3rd
and 4th Battalions taking over the outpost line.
That night the 38th Battalion was relieved, and moved back
to hutments near Mont St. Quentin.
While moving back, hostile bombing ’planes were excep-
tionally active, but, fortunately, the Unit did not suffer by their
operations.
A rest period of 18 days was made at a very pleasantly
situated camp near Mont St. Quentin. After a good rest the first
attraction was the hot baths at Doingt.
Mild training was carried out in the mornings, principally
for Lewis gunners, who were also instructed in the use of enemy
machine guns, two of the guns captured from the enemy being
retained for this purpose.
The Battalion’s popular and energetic “Padre” (Captain-
Chaplain Freer) organised several concerts from local talent.
These entertainments were a great success, and were thoroughly
enjoyed by all. In these days the Australian Divisions were
not separated by distance, as in the earlier days of the war. The
result was that friends and relatives met again after long years
of fighting.
In the many camps scattered for miles around the men
from various Divisions and Brigades gathered together to dis-
cuss the days gone by, the present hopeful situation, and the
bright future, the dawn of which was now breaking.
A mile away from the camp occupied by the 38th Battalion
lay the shattered town of Peronne, surrounded by mounds of
brick dust, where once had stood small villages.
The enemy was not content to leave this area in peace, for
nightly his Gothas purred overhead, and their bombs crashed out
from time to time.
But soon these nocturnal excursions were checked by anti-
aircraft gunners and by our own ’planes, which patrolled the air
ready to tackle the Gothas once they were caught by the broad
beams of the searchlights. On several occasions the area was
lit up by Gothas brought to earth in flames, when cheering for
miles around was heard in the quiet of the night.
About midday stores for the Canteen would arrive when a
long, queue would be quickly formed. Great difficulty was often
experienced in obtaining goods stich as tobacco, cigarettes and
preserved fruits, for which there was a never-ending demand;
but Sergt. Rangecroft and his assistants were to be compli-
mented for the manner in which they toiled to successfully meet
this demand. It was no small task to provide smokes and one
hundred and one odds and ends for a battalion of men whose
appetites for something tasty, to relieve the monotony of army
rations, seemed insatiable.


During the Battalion’s activities at the front one of the
things that helped in no small degree to lighten the hearts of all
was the Band. Though it could not continue as a fighting unit
and remain intact at the same time, for the first seven months of
the Battalion’s entry into the battle line the members of the
Band were engaged in stretcher-bearing and trench warfare.
Right up to the end of the battle of Messines bandsmen had been
the first to come to the aid of the Battalion’s casualties, as well
as in every raid or stunt which occurred. Unfortunately, it was
inevitable that such a body could not carry on without sustaining
casualties. In the trenches before Armentieres, and in the sev-
eral successful raids that occurred on that sector, the Band
sustained five casualties, two being killed. Reinforcements for
stretcher-bearing had to be obtained from the Companies, and
following the Battalion’s entry into the Ploegsteert sector, a
few weeks before the great Messines victory it was becoming
evident that in a short time the Band would be “napoo.” How-
ever, it struggled on, and one Sunday morning, in the heart of
the Ploegsteert Wood, with the enemy in easy hearing distance,
the remaining members of the Band attended a Church Parade,
when for the last time for many weeks it was able to render
the necessary music.
The raids preceding the victory of Messines caused another
serious depletion amongst the remaining personnel of the Band,
when two more players were killed and four wounded. At the
great battle of Messines Ridge four more of the Band were
casualties.
It is hardly necessary at this stage to describe particular
incidents, or to give any general account of the work done by
the Band on the battlefield. Every man of the Battalion who
remembers those first few months will acknowledge the fact
that nothing was too much when first-aid was needed for a
fallen comrade. This fact was emphasised at the first Bat-
talion Parade held after the taking of Messines, when out of a
band of 25 members only six men and the Bandmaster were on
parade. It could be mentioned here that the Band had also
sustained casualties amongst instruments, several of which have
been hit by enemy shell fire.
Many weeks went by before the Band could be brought up
to its former strength. The authorities recognised the value
of regimental bands, and every effort was made to bring instru-
mentalists to the Band, and also to keep it intact for the future,
or as long as the fortunes of war would allow.
An incident is worth recalling which occurred on the night
after the Battalion marched forward to stem the German onrush
before Amiens. The Bandsmen were called upon to carry tea
up to their hungry comrades, so many being told off for each
Company. It was a dark night, the distance was unknown, and
vague directions were given as to the Battalion’s exact location.
However, three Companies received their long-looked-for tea in
due time, but “B” Company had still a long time to wait. At
that time there was a very uncertain feeling in everyone’s mind
as to what was going to happen, but to those few who were en-
gaged in carrying full dixies for “B” Company over paddocks,
hills and ploughed land, in the middle of the night, in the hope


of eventually running up against something or someone, that
peculiar feeling was intensified to a practical certainty that
something was going to happen. Not a sound could be heard —
not even a Verey light was seen —that would give any
indication of the whereabouts of either friend or
foe. One of the party said it could not be much
further before striking the German frontier; another sug-
gested sending a runner back with a report that a wide gap had
been made in the enemy’s line, and to send Light Horse immedi-
ately. However, all speculations and suggestions were suddenly
cut short by a loud challenge to halt. It was said in good English,
and the voice came, it seemed, from the ground. Someone in
rear asked in a whisper whether anyone knew German. But the
next words of the sentry were in the reassuring and unmistak-
able “Aussie lingo,” and the party advanced to find themselves
on to their own Battalion’s trenches, arriving there not from the
rear, but from the front!
Many more incidents could be recorded, and much inter-
esting matter might be written of the Band’s welfare since its
formation at Bendigo were space available. The upkeep of a
regimental band, and its general efficiency musically while on
active service is a difficult and often a discouraging task.
Music, especially when performed by a number together, cannot
be expected to be rendered perfectly during such a rough and
severe experience as active service really is; notwithstanding all
such difficulties, the 38th Band under the conductorship since
its formation in Australia of Sergeant J. J. Code, never failed in
its best endeavors to lighten the hearts of those who were
passing through the nerve-racking strain and hardships of this
great struggle for freedom, safety and justice.
The rest period spent at Mont St. Quentin will always be
remembered as a very happy time.
At 6.30 p.m. on 27th September, the Battalion moved to
bivouacs in rear of Ronssoy Wood. The route taken led through
Busu, Templeux-la-Fosse Longavesnes, Villers-Faucon, and St.
Emilie.
In these days, when the enemy was being pressed back to
his old quarters in the Hindenburg line, along the dusty roads,
endless streams of traffic, artillery, transport sections and infan-
try were pushing forward through the shattered villages and
camps lately occupied by the enemy.
Dumps of war material which he had been unable to take
with him lay at the road-side here and there; everywhere his
notices greeted one from signposts, and afforded a certain amount
of interest to passing troops. “Gott Strafe England,” and other
affectionate greetings were chalked in large letters on the walls
of buildings, and one optimistic Hun artist had sketched His
Majesty King George kneeling before the Kaiser and holding a
lighted match for the All Highest’s cigar. One imagined that the
artist had done this rather clever work when he had advanced
through that village in March.


CHAPTER VIII.
THE BATTALION’S LAST FIGHT.
Through varying scenes of devastation the Battalion
marched to Ronssoy Wood, arriving there at 2 a.m. on 28th Sep-
tember. Tea was provided shortly after arrival at the new area,
hut a much-needed rest was disturbed throughout the early hours
of the morning by a heavy bombardment of gas and high ex-
plosive shells,, and enemy bombing ’planes.
A 10 a.m. a conference of Battalion commanders was held
at Brigade Headquarters, and orders for the next operation
were issued. The day passed away quietly, the troops making
up for sleep lost during the hours of shelling. In the afternoon
the route towards the Brown Line was reconnoitred by a selected
party.
At 5.30 on the following morning, Sunday 29th September,
the members of the 38th Battalion crawled out of their “bivvies”
to prepare for what was to eventually prove their last fight in
the greatest of all wars; a battle which was to be fought along
a wide front and smash the defences of the famous Hindenburg
Line, and drive the enemy back, causing him a few weeks after-
wards to cry out for peace.
All were well acquainted with the nature of the “stunt”
which was, in brief, to follow the Americans through the Hinden-
burg line to their objective, known as the Green Line, then to
exploit their success, pushing through them for a distance of
about four kilometres and there consolidate, this to be done
without the aid of a barrage, and under open warfare conditions.
The barrage which was put down on the enemy to assist
the Americans to advance opened out at 5.50 a.m. and the result
of this, as far as the Battalion was concerned, was that its posi-
tion was heavily “strafed” by enemy gas shells.
The Battalion’s move forward was timed for 7.15 a.m., so
between six o’clock and that time it was subjected to gas, with
the result that nearly all hands were sick, and many became
casualties. The “Fall in” was extremely difficult in consequence
of the shelling and on account of gas masks being worn. Moving
off in column of route, “A” Company (Captain F. E. Fairweather,
M.C.) led, followed by Battalion Headquarters (Lieut.-Colonel G.
Hurry, D. 5.0.); then came “C” Company (Captain C. H. Peters,
M.C.), followed by “B” (Lieut. J. B. O’Donnell) and “D” Com-
pany (Captain W. J. Collins).
The route to be taken to the Brown Line was as follows:
South of the village of Ronssooy to cross roads, then through
Orchard Post to Bellecourt Road, thence north-easterly to
Guillemont Farm, where tanks, as had been arranged, would meet
to co-operate with the Battalion.
Arriving on high ground clear of the gas it was a great re-
lief to remove the suffocating gas masks, and drink in the clear
morning air.
From here the morning was revealed in all its beauty; the
sun shone out, and the atmosphere was pure and fresh. The
landscape was truly magnificent, the country stretching out in


gentle undulations, the hollows being filled with gas and smoke
which created beautiful cloud effects.
It was not long before it was necessary to adopt artillery
formation, the advance being now made over very rough country
and through many belts of wire.
At about 8 a.m. the Unit passed through the artillery bat-
teries which were shooting the barrage for the Americans, and
much to everyone’s surprise suddenly realised that it was at
this early hour under enemy machine gunfire.
A fine spectacle was here witnessed, that of an enemy ’plane
(Red Devil type) flying quite low and dropping signals for guid-
ance to enemy artillery. For quite a long time this “devil”
hovered about, being fired at by machine gunners from all points
until at last it was hit in a vital part and crashed to earth amid
cheering of many troops.
The advance continued until Pot Trench was reached, when
the Battalion was held up by machine gun fire coming from the
direction of Bony. All were at a loss to know what had happened,
for if all had gone well the Americans would be well ahead and
there should be no resistance of this nature at this stage. The
machine gun fire steadily increased.
The leading Company (“A”), which had been held up in
Dog Trench, pushed on again in an attempt to clear up the situa-
tion and advanced in half sectional rushes from shell hole to
shell hole. At 9.50 a.m. ‘C” Company moved on and occupied
their late position, to suffer many casualties from heavy shelling.
“B” Company then took up a position in Cat Post with “D”
Company on their left.
Numbers of Americans, many of whom were wounded, came
filtering back to the Battalion’s positions and were barraged
with questions. Each answer was the same; they had lost their
leaders and did not know where they had been or what had been
done; none could give the information required. The only con-
clusion which could be made was that the Americans had lost
their barrage, which, sweeping ahead according to plan, had
exposed their troops to the fire of machine gunners and riflemen
who had found ample time after the barrage lifted to come out
of their dugouts and prepare their defence. This meant that the
Americans must have failed to accomplish their task of gaining
their objective. This conclusion was later on confirmed when
the Battalion passed through lines of American dead mown down
by enemy machine gunners and snipers.
From the position held by “C” Company in Dog Trench
numbers of tanks could be seen, put out of action by the enemy.
These were in some cases on fire, and from nearly all came
smoke.
« V ,? ry information was being obtained as to the progress
of “A” Company. “C” Company then sent forward a small
patrol, but it almost immediately became casualties. Captain C.
H. Peters. M.C., went out later and located “A” Company’s head-
quarters m a shell hole about 100 yards east of Dog Trench, the
remainder of the Company having consolidated positions in shell
holes within 50 yards of the wire in front of South Guillemont
Trench.


At 11 a.m. it was reported that Captain F. E. Fairweather,
M.C. and Bar, had been seriously wounded in the neck, and Lieut.
Callan had been killed. Later, news came back that Captain
Fairweather had died about ten minutes after being hit, and that
Lieut. J. L. Whitehead was now in charge of “A” Company.
The death of the Company’s O.C. was a severe loss to the
Battalion. Captain Fairweather was one of the Units most
■capable officers, a cool, level-headed soldier, and a fearless
fighter.
At 12.30 information was received that the Americans were
■everywhere in the Green Line, and that the machine guns hold-
ing up the Battalion were a few they had failed to mop up. The
Unit, together with'the 39th and 40th Battalion, was to move for-
ward and get in touch with the Americans. At 3 p.m. the ad-
vance was continued. ‘C” Company moved out of Dog Trench
and pushed forward from shell hole to shell hole under excep-
tionally heavy machine gun fire and shelling, to suffer many
■casualties. At 4 p.m. the Company’s advance was checked by the
broad belt of wire west of South Guillemont Trench. The few
gaps in the wire were under machine gun barrage from the
enemy, who also had snipers covering these gaps. These con-
ditions rendered further progress impossible, so the assistance of
the artillery was called for. Soon our batteries became active
and were successful in silencing many of the machine guns and
minenwerfer. Tanks were then sent for and they trundled up on
their hazardous task; but it was not long before they were put
out of action. A smoke screen was then requested, which was
put down in the valley ahead and proved most effective, en-
abling “A” and “C” Companies to push forward, without being
observed, to the South Guillemont Trench, which had been evacu-
ated by the enemy, excepting a few of his wounded, who were
taken prisoner. Posts were quickly established and were
manned by “Yanks” and “Diggers” combined. The right post
“C” Company was established in touch with the 41st Battalion
on the left; “A” Company established a post . The trench was
cleared and made as comfortable, and as safe from enemy shells
as was possible.
At 7 p.m. Battalion Headquarters moved up. The night
was extremely rough, being wet, windy and very cold. All hands
were in rather low spirits on account of not knowing how things
were actually progressing. At 9 p.m. the cheering news was
passed along to send back to Dog Trench for rations. In an
hour’s time, all were busily eating a hearty meal. At 3.30 a.m.
the morning meal arrived, together with a good supply of cigar-
ettes and matches.
At 4.30 a.m. (September 30th) orders were received that
the 11th Brigade, with two battalions of the 9th Brigade, would
attack at 6 a.m. on a battalion frontage in a northerly direction,
and take up a line running to the Knob. The 10th Brigade
was to clear up Claymore Valley and push on toward Bony.
At 6.30 a.m. the advance was continued, and to the apparent
disappointment of the Americans orders were received that they
were not to accompany the Battalion. “B” Company pushed
through “A” and “C” Companies and took up a, position in Clay-
more Trench and during this operation captured four Hotch-
kiss guns, taken by the enemy from a disabled tank.


“A” and “C” Companies moved forward up Bread Lane and
consolidated in Claymore Trench; “D” Company being in support
in Dog Trench.
At 9.50 a.m. “C” Company pushed forward again by way
of Bony Avenue to a point on the crest of the hill which com-
manded an extensive view of Bony village and the surrounding
country, including the Hindenburg system of trenches.
A patrol from the Company made an attempt to advance,
but was checked by machine gun fire from the village. Liuckily
it succeeded in withdrawing without sustaining a casualty.
The enemy commanded all approaches and was able to en-
gage attacking forces at 800 yards, thus affording the small
Company, its strength now sadly reduced, no chance in the
unequal fight.
“D” Company had now moved up to South Guillemont
Trench, and established its headquarters.
Great satisfaction was expressed when the signallers arrived
at “C” Company’s position with their apparatus, having laid a
wire which connected with Battalion Headquarters. The Com-
pany was now able to send back much valuable information on
account of their splendid position from where enemy movements
could be observed.
At 6 p.m. it was reported from Brigade Headquarters by
’phone that in the morning the 10th Brigade would co-operate
with the 9th Brigade on the right and push forward, possibly
as far as the Knob; definite orders were to follow later. “C”
Company’s post in Bony Avenue was, on account of being de-
tached, then withdrawn to Claymore Trench. But at 8.30 p.m.
the order for the proposed Brigade operation was cancelled.
During the night patrols went forward, but were unable to gain
any information. At 6 a.m. (October Ist) “C” Company re-
established the post in Bony Avenue, and at 8.35 a.m. pushed on
round the north of the village across the Le Catelet Canal, and
there encountered a very determined resistance, a patrol of a
neighboring Company being decimated. In the meantime “B”
Company had followed to mop up the village.
“C” Company, now only 20 strong, dug in with the 39th
Battalion on their left and 33rd Battalion on their right and con-
solidated this new line.
At 2.30 p.m. orders were received that the 37th Battalion
would push forward and occupy the Knob, with the left flank
on the Canal Tunnel end. The 40th Battalion would push out
and occupy Bony Point, in touch with the 37th on the left
and right flank of the Brigade right boundary. The 39th and
38th Battalions would be disposed in the main Hindenburg sys-
tem as supports to the 37th and 40th Battalions respectively.
At 3 p.m., positions as above were established, with the exception
that the 39th Battalion carried out the task of the 40th Bat-
talion, and vice versa. The dispositions of the 38th Battalion
were at this time as follows:
“B” and “C” Companies in that portion of the Hindenburg
Line known as A 15 b, “A” Company in Bony Avenue, and “D”
Company in support; Battalion Headquarters was now estab-
lished at Al3c. While “D” Company was taking up its new posi-
tion Captain W. J. Collins, 0.C., was badly wounded.

COMPANY IN
DOG TRENCH, HINDENBERG
LINE.


Lieut. E. Potter then took charge of the Company and
directed its movements in an able manner.
The Battalion now being in support, was able to seek a
much-needed rest when several of the huge dugouts in the Hin-
denburg system were occupied. These dugouts were wonderful
caverns, deep and concreted and able to accommodate whole
battalions. Here all felt as safe from shell fire as if hundreds
of miles from the line. The only danger which at first pre-
sented itself was the possibility of their being mined, but a cai’e-
ful examination by engineers dissolved that fear.
On reaching the Hindenburg Line one had experienced a
great feeling of elation, together with a sense of disappointment
in regard to the construction of the trenches from an engineering
point of view. One had pictured these trenches as being tre-
mendously elaborate, but on beholding them their main features
proved to be difficult wire entanglements, deep trenches, and
huge dugouts.
On the following day (October 2nd) the Battalion’s positions
were maintained. Enemy artillery was moderately active, par-
ticularly in the vicinity of Bony.
After 12.15 p.m. the welcome news of an early relief was
received, the 10th Brigade’s positions to be taken over by the
151st Brigade, B.E.F.
In accordance with the order received, the 38th Battalion
was to withdraw to the old bivouacs in the rear of Ronssoy
Wood. The withdrawal commenced at 4.30 p.m. and was complete
at 5.45 p.m. On arrival at the Wood a good hot meal awaited
the Battalion, and after it had been enjoyed by hungry, tired
men, all crept back into those little bivouacs which had been
deserted on the morning of September 22nd, while men passed
through Hell’s gate. Many had not returned to their bivouacs.
One face in particular was missed; the cheery face of the Bat-
talion’s Padre, Chaplain-Captain Freer. He had last beee seen
helping out the wounded. Now he was posted as missing. But
great was the joy expressed by all when, afterwards it was dis-
covered that he was still in the land of the living; but the feeling
of joy was slightly marred by the fact that the “Padre had
lost one of his merry eyes through the bursting of a shell.
Among those who fell in the fight for the Hindenburg Line
was Lieutenant-Colonel R. O. Henderson, commanding the o9th
Battalion Great sorrow was expressed when the news ot his
death reached the 38th Battalion. Lieut.-Colonel Henderson
sailed from Australia with the 38th Battalion, and m February,
1917, was appointed to command the 39th Battalion.
Throughout the whole of the Division he was admired as a
clever and fearless leader, and was idolized by his men.
Many heroic deeds had been performed; the Battalion
winning further honoi 3 The Unit’s Quartermaster (Lieutenant
P J Telfer) being awarded the Military Cross, and Capta n •
H Peters a bar to his Military Cross. Nine Military Medals
were won by the N.C.O.’s and men. (See appendix.) Sergeant
E. S. Beard, of the Transport Section, winning a bar to his medal
won at Ypres.


Thus ends the account of how a mere handful of tired Aus-
tralians took up a fight after regiments of brave Americans had
been cut up, and their settled plan had been foiled; and how
these same “Aussies”, suffering heavy casualties, fought with
skill, endurance, and tenacity a four days’ battle; captured a
section of the Hun’s much-vaunted Hindenburg Line; captured
the village of Bony; crossed the famous Le Catalet Canal and
held a rapidly-dug line until other troops passed through them
and continued the victorious advance which was to quickly bring
peace which the whole world eagerly awaited after four long
years of terrific and ghastly warfare.
Before turning in for/the night it had been announced that
on the following day a competition would be held, to be won by
the dirtiest man in the Battalion. After four days’ struggle
when one’s daily toilet was completely forgotten, it will be
readily imagined that this competition was not to be easily
judged. However, Corporal “Joe” Foster, of “B” Company, look-
ing like a cave man of pre-historic days, and wearing a fierce
growth of beard which vainly strove to hide the smiles wreathing
his genial “Aussie dial,” walked off triumphant.
CHAPTER IX.
“THE TRAIL THAT LEADS TO HOME.”
On October 3rd, the Battalion moved from Ronssoy Wood to
the vicinity of Aizecourt. Resting here until the sth an order
arrived from Brigade to the effect that the Unit wa3
to move back to a rest near Abbeville. Moving on a
light railway conveyed the Battalion to Peronne, from where it
moved to an entraining point at Flamicourt. Entraining here at
4.15 in the afternoon, Pont Remy was reached just before mid-
night, and after a four mile march the quiet little villages of
Bellifontaine and Bailleul accommodated the tired troops. “A”
and “B” Companies billeting in the former village, and “C” and
“D” Companies with Battalion Headquarters at Bailleul. Day-
light revealed a picturesque neighborhood, a green valley which
Autumn had commenced to color with her magic brush. The
apple orchards held a canopy of yellow leaves above the green
grass; and in the woods richer tints splashed the leaves of trees
and climbers. After long months of fighting in torn and de-
vastated areas what a delight and a relief it was to gaze upon
green rounded hills, the orchards where late rosy apples still
clung to the trees, and the gorgeous woods; all untouched by the


marring hand of war. All war’s attendant strains immediately
fell from one’s shoulders, a burden gladly dropped at the road-
side and quickly forgotten as one turned aside to wander in peace
through fields and woods. . •
A stay of eighteen days was made in this neighborhood.
Mild training was carried out, and the Battalion was reorganised
on a four company basis. These were busy days for the boot-
makers, tailors, and barber, for after many weeks of hard work
up in the line, clothing, boots and hair were in a ragged con-
dition. In these days the daily newspapers were rushed.
Germany, baffled and beaten, was crying out for an armis-
tice which would lead to an early peace; so it will easily be
imagined how waiweary men feverishly read the daily columns,
often, perhaps, sceptically, for even those who knew that the
Hun was badly beaten found it hard to realise that the long
struggle would soon be over.
On October 14th instructions were received from high
authority that the 37th Battalion would organise as two Com-
panies and amalgamate with the 38th Battalion. The personnel
from the 37th would form “A” and “B” Companies of the 38th
whose personnel would form “C” and “D” Companies. “A”
and “B” Companies of the 38th Battalion amalgamated to form
new “C” Company, “C” and “D” Companies formed new “D”
Company.
On October 18th the Unit moved to billets at Sorel and
Wanel, villages about four miles distant from Bailleul. The
Transport Section remained on at Bailleul owing to the scarcity
of water in the other villages.
On the morning of the 19th the Battalion was inspected
by the Acting Brigadier (Lieut.-Colonel Jess). Light rains and
cold weather now set in, but the days were brightened by
intermittent sunshine. A Brigade sports meeting was held
on 26th October in the neighborhood of Hocquincourt, the
championship being won by the 10th Field Ambulance.
Football practice was now in full swing, and a complete
Divisional programme of matches was arranged. This com-
petition commenced on 2nd November, when the 38th Battalion
defeated the 3rd Div. Signal School at Hallencourt.
Another keenly contested match played against the 39th
Battalion on 9th November resulted in a win for that Unit.
On Monday, 11th, a telegram was received from Brigade,
which stated that an armistice had been signed by the belligerent
armies.
It was surprising how quietly the news was received. When
one had struggled on through long years of bitter warfare,
which at times had seemed a never-ending business, it was
difficult to grasp the wonderful fact that at last the curtain
had been lowered on the world’s hideous drama, and that
victory—a Glorious Victory—was the Allies’ reward for their
dogged stand (often at times against huge odds), and their
persistent attacks of the past three months.
On the 10th day of December the Battalion again moved
to take up fresh quarters in Vismes-au-val, Oisement area.
Liberal leave to the United Kingdom, Paris and to Italy, was


now being granted, and also to the surrounding towns and
villages. Abbeville, the town so loved by Ruskin for its
architectural beauties, proved a great attraction.
Mr. W. D. Craufurd, in “Peeps Into Picardy,” says:
“The Ambaine were probably the first inhabitants of
this district, and on the appearance of the Romans
took refuge on an island in the Somme, which be-
came a place of defence for them, and later on the
actual site of the city. Ceasar held these people in great ad-
miration on account of their bravery. From the conquest of
Julius Caesar until the invasion of the Franks, Ponthieu re-
mained under the dominion of the Emperors, and was called
“Abbatis Villa.” The domination of the Romans can be seen
by the number of vast entrenchments in the country around,
especially at Liercourt and in the neighborhood of St. Valery.
They have quite modified the aspect of the countryside. These
camps were evidently destined to defend the banks of the
Somme against the attacks of the Northern Belgians. Some
historians hold that it was in this river that Caesar collected
the large Flotilla with which he made his second expedition to
great Britain.
The district of Abbeville is the richest in antiquities in the
Department; it is traversed from east to north by an ancient
road, called Brunehault Grand Chemin, or La Chaussee Brune-
hault, after the mother of Clothaire 1., whose name was Brune-
hault. This road passes through Noyelles-en-Chaussee, Estrees
and Le Crecy. There is reason to believe that it is part of
the great Roman Road from Lyon to Boulogne-sur-Mer, via
Amiens, which, on Strabo’s authority, was constructed by order
of the Emperor Augustus.”
“In the Fifth Century, a horde of Barbarians, as they were
called, from Germany, fell as a thunderbolt upon this portion
of the Roman Empire, dealing destruction on all sides, until, in
the IXth Century, this once-important town was reduced to a,
mere farm, belonging to the great neighboring Abbey of St.
Riquier.
“Since then, and particularly in later centuries, the tables
have been turned, for Abbeville is now the important city, St.
Riquier, having degenerated into a quiet and almost deserted
village, beautifully situated, and surrounded by the 'glories of
its past.”
Ruskin, in his “Proeterita,” says:—“For cheerful, unalloyed,
unwearying pleasure, the getting in sight of Abbeville on a fine
summer afternoon, jumping out in the courtyard of the Hotel
de l’Europe, and rushing down the street to see St. Wulfram
before the sun was off the towers, are things to cherish
the past for —to the end.”
The church of St. Wulfram is a magnificent specimen of
Gothic style, flanked by two suburb Gothic towers. Several
other churches in Abbeville are worthy of careful examination,
especially that of St. Sepulchre and St. Giles. The town
boasts many ancient buildings, and has an old-world charm
which takes one’s thoughts step by step back through those
centuries crowded with romance.


Twelve miles north-east of Abbeville lies the picturesque
little town of Crecy, where was fought one of the greatest
battles of ancient times. Its main street is flanked by trees
and quaint houses, and in the Place du Marche are two
memorials of the battle —a red brick column surmounted by
a small cross erected by the English immediately after the
event; the other erected by public subscription in France,
Luxemburg, and Bohemia in memory of those who fell in the
battle.
Although the towns radiating from the village of Visnes-au-
val (occupied by the Battalion) were rather bare in these months
of winter, their historical associations lent color to them, making
them interesting and attractive.
Christmas had come round once again—the third Christmas
they spent in France, and happily the last.
The weather had been boisterous and wet, but on Christmas
morning the sun shone out to brighten one of the happiest
days spent in France. Company dinners were held in the
roomy billets, where at 1 o’clock the Battalion cooks served
a sumptuous meal, which received an ovation.
Lieut.-Colonel Hurry, D. 5.0., the unit’s popular commander,
visited the happy companies as they sat at dinner to wish them
a Merry Christmas, and to receive a warm welcome.
Once again the 10th Brigade Comforts Fund had given
Father Christmas a commission, for on Christmas Eve every
member of the Battalion received an “Aussie parcel packed
and despatched by the untiring hands of the Comforts Fund
workers in far-away Victoria. Each parcel contained the
Season’s Greetings and a message of good cheer. Everyone
realised what a wonderful work was being done for their
comfort by the senders of the parcels. It was not only at
Christmas time that this was realised, for regular supplies of
comforts were continually arriving from Australia, and the
“Thank you” that escaped the lips of the recipients of the
good things were the expressions of truly grateful hearts.
Leave to Abbeville and the surrounding towns was granted
in the afternoon, when the perfect weather added to the day’s
enjoyment.
The fighting being over, the training now carried out was
of a very mild nature, and really amounted to daily exercise
so necessary to ensure the physical fitness of so many men.
Easy route marches became very popular, for it was no pleasure
to be idle in these days, flavored with Winter’s sharp sting.
Lectures and classes on educational subjects were held; but
a matter of still greater interest was the filling in of Repatriation
Forms. The word DEMOBILISATION constantly figured in
daily conversations. There was something magical about this
word. It spelt AUSTRALIA in large, glowing letters. It led
one’s thoughts to sunny shores, and on into the vast bushlands,
and into the bright glow of the home fireside.
Men were restless nowadays, restless for a sight of the
homeland. This was natural, but wise heads had fashioned
weapons to combat this feeling of restlessness. Educational
classes lectures, sports meetings, concerts and dances fought


it, and almost conquered it. Although the call of the Homeland
still rang in men’s ears, there were times when it subsided to
a whisper. The voices of English girls hushed it, merry-faced
girls, who came along in their neat khaki costumes to dance
with the “Digger,” and cheer the hours of waiting.
And so the days at Vismes-au-val were full of interest,
and if any man found them dull he had but himself to blame.
At last the day arrived (Monday, 17th February) when the
first draft from the 38th Battalion left the peaceful little village
en route for Australia, via Le Havre and England. With light
hearts and eager footsteps 14 officers, 36 N.C.O’s., and 257 men
stepped out on to the homeward track.
“The Long, Long Trail,” which had wound for so long a
time through dangerous and difficult ways, was now growing
short, and led through the sunshine of peace and happiness.
Many had fallen where the ti’ail led through “The Valley
of the Shadow,” and those who now marched away remembered
them, and cherished their memory.
And they, and those who were soon to follow, were to
carry back to their native land an imperishable record of Honor
and Glory.
One of their proud boasts was that only five (5) members
of the Battalion had been captured by the enemy, and the
capture of these men brought no shame upon the Unit, for
four had been badly wounded, and the fifth lost in the
darkness of “No Man’s Land,” to unconsciously wander inta
the enemy territory.
And so the first draft to return to Australia marched down
the sunlit Trail to the strains of the Old Battalion Band as
Morning came to meet them over the hills of Picardy.
THE END.

History of 38th (Bendigo) Battalion, A.I.F.

THE A.I.F.
IN MINATURE
Every battalion was in a manner an epitome of
the A.I.F. A history of any one battalion gives a
better idea of the life of the A.I.F. as a whole
than does many a more pretentious volume. Such a
book as this :
THE 38th BATTALION
(A.1.F.)
The Story and Official History ..byE. Fairey
With a foreword by flight Hon. W. M. Hughes.
Written by one of the men, it gives us a
wonderfully vivid picture of the Battalion from its
formation in Bendigo to its disbandment.
The author has painted the picture with no
gloomy pen, for while never minimizing the terrible
trials and casualities they met with, he shows the
other side of the picture in their life in billets
and rest-camps, and in the everyday incidents which
served to make life bearable.
In reading the book, you will experience, again
and again, a thrill of pride at the glorious record
it gives.
