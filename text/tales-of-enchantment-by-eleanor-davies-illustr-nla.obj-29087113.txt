So the Owl and the Cockatoo flew to the

“Look at my fluffy yellow dress!" sang
Miss Wattle. “What a grand thing it is to
be so fair and so renowned!’’
The Waratah favoured her sister with a
haughty stare.
“Pray, why should you be so vain and
proud? For what are you renowned?”
“Haven’t you heard? The mortals have
selected me as the national flower of this
fair land!”
“That, my dear Wattle, should never have

been chosen as the national flower of Aus-
tralia!”
“Oh, how can you! Oh, this is dreadful!”
gasped the Wattle.
“Dreadful! What is there dreadful about
it?”
“Tut —tut!” screeched the White Cockatoo,
as he flew from the branches of a near-by
tree. “You are disturbing my children.
What are you quarreling about?”
“It is preposterous, White Cockatoo! Miss
Waratah is making outrageous statements;
she says she should have been chosen as the
National flower of Australia!”
“And who is to say she shouldn’t have
been?” inquired White Cockatoo, preening
his wings with interest.
“Oh”, burst out Miss Wattle indignantly,
“I know you are on her side! You always
were! But say what you will, I still proclaim
my rights.”
“We must have this settled”, said Miss
Waratah, disdainfully.
“We must, indeed. We will consult wise
old Judge Owl.” “Go to him, then, White
Cockatoo, and tell him Miss Wattle and Miss
Waratah wish to consult him.”
“Can this not be settled privately?”
“We do not agree.”
“Indeed we do not.”
“Then I shall go to the Judge.’
White Cockatoo spread his beautiful wings
and flew over the tree-tops. At last he came
to the wise old owl’s home in a gaunt gum
tree.
“Wise Owl, wake up, we need you” he
screeched.
“Who dares to disturb my slumber?”
hooted the Owl.
“The White Cockatoo.”

“You are a very handsome flower, yourself,
“You are a pretty little thing yourself, Miss
Boronia.”
Mr. Flannel-flower,” said Mr. Alagpie, turn-
ing to his witness.
Miss Boronia blushed.
“Yes, sir, but I make no claim to great
dignity. It has been said, of course, that lam
pretty and my petals resemble that famous
cloth known as flannel, but 1 have always
regarded myself as a lonely shrub growing
in the bush.”
“Your witness, Air. Kookaburra.”

“ Would you not call.the Waratah a majes-

“I resent your insulting remarks, Air. Snake-
Eater,” said Air. Flannel-flower, quivering
with anger.
“Order, order!” thundered Wise Owl,
ruffling his feathers. “Order in the Court.”
Air. Magpie sprang forward.
“But, your Honor, Air. Kookaburra has
no right to insult my witnesses and cannot
expect compliments in return.”
Mr. Kookaburra ignored him and con-
tinued.
“Will you kindly answer my question, Air.
Flannel-face?”
“ When you address me respectfully, I will
answer your question!” said Air. Flannel-
flower with dignity.
“Very well, Mr. . . . er . . , Flannel-
flower.”
“I grant you that the Waratah is a majestic
flower, but presents too formal an appearance
for my liking, resembling a drumstick rather
than a flower, and, in my opinion, doesn’t
bear comparison with the artistic beauty of
the golden wattle.”

“But I would not presume, sir, to dispute
the right of Miss Wattle to be styled the
emblem flower of this beauteous country.
Some people may admire my gay pink petals,
others my brown winter dress!”
“Thank you, Aliss Boronia. Your witness,
my friend.”
“Aliss Boronia,” said Air. Kookaburra, the
defending Counsel, with a husky cackle. “Evi-
dently you do not attach much importance to
yourself as a flower?”
“I did not say that, Air, Kookaburra.”
“Nor as a critic, I presume, Aliss Boronia.”
“Well,” casting him a scornful glance from
under her velvety lashes. “I may, unlike you,
be modest in my demeanour, but I have the
right to criticise as well as any other flower,
and I certainly think that the myriad golden
blossoms of the Wattle far exceed the beauty
of the lonely Waratah,”
The Counsel for the Plaintiff, Mr. Alagpie,
then called. Air. Xmas Bush.
Air. Xmas Bush was a fussy old man, with
many little branches covered with pale pink
blossoms sprouting all over him.
“You are well acquainted with Aliss Wattle
and Aliss Waratah?”
“I have seen many of the two flowers,” he
puffed, “and undoubtedly prefer the Wattle;
she is the symbol of the golden sunshine and
we all love her. The Waratah is a lonely
isolated flower with ... er ... a certain stiff
beauty, but ... er ... I feel that I, even 1,
should . , . er . . . have more claim to the title
than she!”
“Just so . , . that will do, Air. Xmas Bush.”
“Your witness, my friend.”
Air. Kookaburra opened his mouth and
cackled heartily.

Xmas Bush, to be prettier and more entitled

to be the national flower of this fair land than
the gorgeous Waratah?”
“It was a passing thought, sir, and perhaps
you will agree that I grow plentifully at
Xmas time and often assist Father Xmas in
the festive season and lend what beauty 1 have
to adorn our Australian homes . .
“Even so . . . you must admit that the
colouring of the Waratah is superior to that
of the Wattle?”
“That is a matter of opinion.”
“More brilliant than your own?”
“Perhaps so, Mr. Kookaburra. There are
those who appreciate the glaring brilliance of
the Waratah, but, in my opinion, it lacks the
soft, feathery glory of a cluster of golden
wattle blossoms, or even my pink delicacy.”
“And don't forget,” piped Wild Clematis,
“that the mortals have set aside a special day
in honour of the Wattle, and call it Wattle
Day!”
“As for that,” cried Silver Slipper, “there
are special laws to protect the Waratah and
all of us wild flowers, but they are not
enforced.”
Air. Alagpie hopped forward on his spindle
legs, pulling down his black vest impressively
over his puffed-up breast.
“Your Honor, I could call many more
witnesses, but think it unnecessary at present.”
Judge Owl turned to Air. Kookaburra and
said:
“Have you any witnesses, Air. Jackass?”
“Yes, your Honor, but I would respectfully
call your attention to the fact that my proper
name is Kookaburra. I may laugh like an ass
in my stupid hearty fashion, but 1 am not
altogether as stupid as some people seem to
think.”
“Tut-tut, sir,” said Judge Owl, “Call your
witnesses, Air. Kookaburra, which name you
seem to prefer, though not so appropriate to
my way of thinking.”
Air. Kookaburra called Air. Dandelion.
Mr. Dandelion tottered into their midst,
adjusted his spectacles, shook his old beard,
while the breeze scattered his fluffy grey hair.
“You have lived in Australia for a great
number of years, Mr. Dandelion?”
Air. Dandelion gave vent to a deafening
sneeze.
“Oh, pray excuse me, sir, but Aliss Wattle
always affects me in this way.”
Air. Kookaburra smiled and cackled.
“I sympathise with your condition, Air.
Dandelion, but will you try and control your-
self and answer my question?”
“Now, Mr. Dandelion, will you kindly give
your opinion of the merits of Miss Wattle
and Miss Waratah?”
“I have always regarded Miss Waratah as
the most stately and beautiful wild flower in
Australia. Her dignified appearance attracts the
eye because of her gorgeous colouring, and
is, in my opinion, more handsome than the
fluffy, dusty blossoms which adorn Aliss Wat-
tle, who are here to-day and gone to-morrow,
and whose perfume leaves much to be desired.”
Aliss Wattle shook her gofden dress dis-
dainfully.
“Dear, dear!” muttered Air. Dandelion,
almost suffocated, and sneezed again.
I really cant help it!” he apologised.
Mr. Alagpie hopped forward.
“You wish the Court to believe, sir, that
your sneezing is due to Aliss Wattle’s pollen?”
“Yes, Air. Alagpie.”
“All fibs!” roared Bottle-brush contemptu-
ously. “You know you caught a cold last
night!”
“I did not!” quavered Air. Dandelion,
indignantly.
“Order! order!” hooted Judge Owl.
.Is it not a fact that you were out flirting
with Wild Clematis last night?”
dallying there?”
“It is possible, sir.”
“That will do, Air. Dandelion. I have
finished with this witness, your Honor, whose
testimony is not so forcible as his sneeze!”
Mr. Kookaburra gobbled up a caterpillar
which had been cautiously making its way be-
tween him and a group of hungry butcher
birds, who were gossiping under the bough
of a wild cherry tree, and said: “Call Aliss
Clover!”
A short, elderly spinster stepped primly
forward and glanced coldly at Air. Alagpie.
Yes, sir. All the wild flowers have lived
in Austialia for years! Aly ancestors date
back for centuries before Mortals came! We
grew in profusion everywhere, unmolested by
the tread of their careless feet; untroubled
by the thoughtless destructions of Mortal
hands!”
Another deafening sneeze resounded through
the glade, which almost blew the twelve
apostles off their perch.

a bow. Wt
“Thank you, Mr. Kookaburra,” giggled [/
the vision. - f
“Tell me, how would you compare Miss
Waratah and Miss Wattle?”
“Well, sir, if you placed a Waratah and
a sprig of Wattle side by side, they would
not bear comparison: the Wattle would fade
into insignificance. One is gorgeous, and the
Wattle . . . well ... as a matter of fact . . .
I may be prejudiced, of course, but I dislike
its colouring very much.”

Miss Wattle?”
“Yes, I prefer Miss Waratah because of
her magnificent colour, her dignity and lasting
qualities.”
“Your witness, Mr. Magpie.”
Mr. Magpie drew a quill from his wing
and tapped his beak impressively.
“Don’t you think, Miss Clover, that your
insignificance in the flower world makes it
an impertinence on your part to voice such
a strong opinion against Miss Wattle?
“Look here, my chattering friend, don’t
think you can twist me round your scaly
claws! I stand here a poor specimen, as you
call me, but a dignified one, and definitely
state that the Waratah is by far the superior
of the two flowers.”
“Ho, ho! You belie your modest looks,
Miss Clover?”
“Indeed,” replied Miss Clover, “I am not
so gentle as to stand any nonsense from you,
Mr. Chatterbox!”

“Who asked you to interfere?” snapped
Miss Clover.

“Yes, but all the little children love me.

And if you were standing close to the Waratah
you would only be able to see part of her?”
“Yes, that is so, sir.”
“That will be all, Aliss Clover.”
Air. Kookaburra then said, “Call Aliss

A dainty vision in blue made towards Judge
Owl, her frock swept over the soft ground
and reflected the tiny silver moonbeams as
they shone through the trees, turning her
gown into an exquisite mesh of ethereal blue
and silver.

g(thci with the vast concourse of birds, flowers
and animals who had occupied the Court,
departed, and as Miss Waratah saw the last
of their fluttering wings she turned to Miss
Wattle,
“Hear, hear,” twittered the Jury in a
chorus, their eyes on a fat worm gliding by.
“You have a very uncommon case to decide.
One, perhaps, which is unique in the annals
of bushland history. You must give your ver-
dict according to the evidence you have heard,
and must consider which of the two flowers,
Miss Wattle or Miss Waratah, is entitled
to be called Australia’s national flower. Both
these flowers are very beautiful, though their
style is entirely different. The Wattle is
the messenger of Spring, a flower of dazzling
beauty and a joy to behold with its masses
of golden blossoms! The Waratah, though
not growing in such profusion as the Wattle,
strikes the eye as something gorgeous, noble
and rich in colour, and a flower which we are
proud to have dwelling in our midst!
I suppose you are satisfied, now, you vain
piece of yellow fluff!” she sobbed bitterly.
1 ne\ er thought you would live to cause me
such humiliation!”
Hush, Waratah, hush! Nothing can alter
the fact that I have been proclaimed by Mor-
tals and in our own bush circle the national
flower of Australia.”
M IPS?
Miss Waratah’s sobs grew louder and lou-
der, and, as the tears splashed down her crim-
son dress, Miss Wattle’s heart melted, and
she realised for the first time how vain and
conceited she had been.

“Gentlemen, you must now consider your
verdict, and if you find in favour of the
plaintiff, Miss Wattle, you must award her
such damages as you think she deserves, and
if you are doubtful about the issue you
must find in favour of the defendant, Miss
Waratah.”
“Don’t cry so, Waratah. I have always
loved you! And have always admired your
majestic beauty! I pray, dear Waratah, that
you will forgive me and that we shall never
quarrel again. Will you share with me the
honour of being the national flower?”

Waratah looked up and smiled through her
tears.
The twelve apostles consulted together for
a few moments, during the hush that had
fallen over the gossiping flowers and woodland
creatures. The foreman arose.
“Oh, Wattle, how very sweet of you! I
now understand why all the little birds and
flowers love you!”
“Gentlemen of the Jury, have you arrived
at a verdict?” said White Cockatoo, the Judge’s
Associate.
Wattle beamed. “I do think as two of the
most beautiful wild flowers in Australia, it is
for us to set a good example to our mortal
friends and bush brethren ... let us therefore
cast arger from our hearts and live in peace
and harmony for evermore.”
‘We have arrived at a verdict in favour
of Miss Wattle, but are not inclined to allow
her more than nominal damages.”
There were sounds of fluttering wings
among the bushes. Mr. Kookaburra cackled
dolefully, whilst Mr. Magpie let forth a
series of triumphant squawks.
So the W 7 attle and the Waratah kissed, and
the spirit of happiness entered their hearts.
1 he apostles, who had been lingering near-
by watching the scene un-noticed, suddenly set
up a deafening clamour of rejoicing, and
fluttered away to spread the good news
throughout the forest, while the man in the
moon winked as he sailed across the cloudless
sky.
Judge Owl addressed the Court.
“In accordance with the Jury’s finding, I
have pleasure in recording their verdict in
favour of Miss Wattle, and I may say that
1 entirely agree with their verdict in only
awarding her nominal damages, as by her
selfishness, conceit and vanity, unworthy quali-
ties in flowers, birds and lirtle Mortals, she
has been responsible for irritating Miss Wara-
tah almost beyond endurance. I may add that
all the wild flowers are exquisite gems in
Australia’s national crown of beauty! The
Court is now adjourned!”
One by one, the Judge, the White Cocka-
too, Mr. Magpie and Mr. Kookaburra, to-

Prince Dodo and his men replenished them-
selves with meat and wine, and set out imme-
diately to the Griffin’s cave.
As they approached, Dodo ordered his men
to stand by.
He then sprang from the saddle, sword in
hand, and advanced towards the cavern. The
half-eaten carcases of sheep and cattle lay
strewn about. At the back of the cave he
could see huddled together ten maidens, white
with fear, tears of anguish shaking their
delicate forms.
At just that moment a terrific roar shook
the earth, and rumbled away into the moun-
tains, and a giant creature, half bird, half
lion, emerged from the cave, his tail swishing
angrily, his mouth vomiting forth fire. Ihe
ladies trembled and clung to each other
piteously, while the Prince, though horrified
at the sight of the monster, crept closer, and
there began a savage fight. The monster strove
to hurl his enormous body upon Dodo and
crush the life out of him; he spread his great
talons as if to rip the skin from his body, but
Dodo, nimble as an elf, sprang this way and
that, and eluded him, and had the Griffin
completely baffled.
Dodo’s sword was busy, but he found it
hard work to fatally pierce the tough skin.
Round and round they twisted, ’mid the Grif-
fin’s roars and the maidens’ screams. The dust
rose higher and higher as faster and faster
they whirled. Almost suffocated, Dodo re-
treated, and of a sudden a brilliant thought
came to him. He sprang forward for a fresh
attack, and stood immediately in front of the
creature’s dripping jaws. ith a quick jerk
he thrust the point of his sword first in one
eye, then in the other, leaving the monster
roaring in agony and bewilderment. The
Griffin waggled his head to and fro, growling
with pain. Prince Dodo signalled his men to
kill the blind monster, which they quickly did,
taking care to avoid the claws and swishing
tail of the infuriated beast.
Dodo went into the cave and approached
the tearful maidens.
“Oh, noble sir, are we to escape?” whispered
a lovely voice, and Dodo found himself look-
ing into the bluest eyes he had ever seen.
Golden curls framed a sweet little face, but
her pretty lips were quivering with fright.
Dodo thought she was an angel.
“Fair lady,” he said, “the Griffin is dead;
you are free.”
The Princess and her ladies were overcome
with joy.
C I*' 1 s r '
x, li I V-J- ... ...... -- —3—— * 1
The Prince joined his waiting men, and
together they escorted the Princess and her
maidens to the palace.
The King celebrated the speedy return of
his daughter. He was as good as his word,
and gave Dodo half his kingdom, and like-
wise Veva’s heart and hand, for the Prince
had fallen in love with the Princess and she
with him, so it was a very happy kingdom
that rejoiced over the downfall of the terrible
Griffin.
In due course the two lovers were married,
and lived happily in the palace for many
months, but by-and-by Dodo so longed to see
his father and take his bride to his home, that
he became restless, and acquainted the King
of his intention.
The King was very sad at the thought of
parting with his daughter, but he bore it well,
and loaded fifty of his most valuable horses
with gold and jewels, and saw them on their
way. They looked a rich and grand little band
as they travelled towards Dodo s kingdom,
with the old King’s blessing ringing in their
They arrived at his father’s kingdom with
great pomp, and the courtiers received the
foreign bride with pride and joy. King
Maqueda loved her at first sight.
Not so Zalia, who was frantically jealous
at this turn of events. All day long V eva was
courted and petted, much to Zalia s fury and
discontent. She knew the girl had supplanted
her in the affections of Dodo, and was con-
sumed with jealous rage.
At last, in desperation, she consulted a
Golden Slate which an old witch had once
given her, telling her that if she were ever in
doubt about anything to consult the slate, by
saying:
" O, Golden Slate, I thee implore.
Pray tell me what thou hast in store/
And the slate would instantly be covered
in writing, telling the questioner what to do!
Feeling that she could bear it no longer,
she sat down at her table with the slate before
her and muttered:
“O, Golden Slate, I thee implore.
Pray tell me what thou hast in store/’
And she added of her own accord:
“To gain the lover I adore/’
Instantly the slate became filled with small
writing. She bent her head closer and read:
“Get the Princess alone one day
In the garden, and to her say :

exquisite head drooping lowly. Wicked Zalia
clapped her hands in glee, then assumed an
air of childlike innocence and retraced her
steps towards the palace.
"‘Change, change, before my very eyes.
Change so the Prince will ne’er be wise,
Change to an Orchid, blossoming fair.
Beautiful flower beyond compare.
“Where is the Princess?” was on every-
body’s lips, while they hunted high and low
for her. No one thought of a spell, so after
a long hunt they gave up in despair.
" ‘Ne’er speak until thou art addressed,
Advise all those who are distressed.
Thus ordains the magic spell
Under whose pow’rs thou’rt forced to
dwell.
The days went quickly on, and Dodo grew
tired of looking for his Princess. “She is
dead ! She is dead!” he would say, and nothing
would comfort him. Life went on as usual
and Court frivolity had its sway, but Dodo
grew pale and listless and went about the
palace like a shadow.
" ‘All Fairy Powers wilt be thine.
Known as “The Magic Orchid” in time;
For plots and plans thou wilt unravel.
To many countries thy wisdom will travel.
But among his father’s courtiers there was
one he noticed who did not join in the gaiety,
and she was no other than the heartless Zalia.
Dodo noticed her sorrowful eyes and quiver-
ing lips, and asked her if she were grieving
over anything.
" ‘Honoured and courted wilt thou be.
1 do now most solemnly decree;
Very carefully thou'lt be tended
By all the folk thou hast defended.
“ ‘For thy destruction I prophesy
Small chance —but even shouldst thou die.
Zalia glanced up at him, while her dark
eyes filled with tears which fell down her
cheeks.
Regain thou wilt thy human form,
And be as thou wert —Veva reborn!’ ”
Needless to say, the Duchess was astonished
when she read these words, and was doubtful
as to whether the charm would work; but she
resolved to try it as soon as she had an
opportunity.
“Oh, Prince Dodo!” she cried. “How can
they dance and enjoy themselves when dear
Veva is lost . . . dead . .!’’
“Ah, Duchess, I fear me my loved one is
dead, but you are right; it is hard to join in the
gaieties with this sorrow hanging over our
heads. We are of one heart, madam. Per-
chance you would permit me to talk with
you, sometimes. Truly, it would be a great
comfort.”
A few days later the lords and ladies were
playing a game in the gardens when the
Princess, feeling very tired, sank on to a gar-
den seat out of range of the players, and
Zalia, who had been ever watchful, thought
she had never seen the Princess look more
lovely. Fresh jealousy spurred her on, and
she approached the Princess and sat down
beside her. She clutched the Princess’s arm
tightly and began reciting very slowly the
words which had been written on the Golden
Slate. Veva thought she was a trifle mad and
listened good-humoredly, but when Zalia came
to the last words, she shuddered and trembled
with fear.
So the Duchess and the Prince were much
together, drawm by their “seeming” mutual
sympathy, and by and by the Prince’s heart
grew tender towards the artful Zalia. He
told himself that she was the only one in the
palace who really had loved his dead Veva, ex-
cept the King, so it was quite natural that he
should walk arm-in-arm with her along the
handsome terraces, conversing softly.
"So vanish to the gardens gay.
At last things came to such a pass that he
asked her to wed him, and Zalia, with joy
in her heart, consented, and they were be-
trothed, and after the wedding lived in the
palace with much content.
Change to the Orchid this very day;
Peace unto thee in thy new life.
But Dodo will soon take me for a wife!”
Veva grew paler and paler, and before she
could utter a scream of protest she vanished
rrom human sight.
Now that Zalia had obtained her own ends
she forgot her former wickedness and was a
kind and courteous helpmate to Dodo, who
was very fond of her, but never loved her as
he had his Veva.
Zalia looked dumbfounded, and, realising
the spell had worked in spite of her doubts,
sped to the flower beds and searched eagerly
for the Orchid and at last found it—a won-
derful flower —beautiful as a poem, with its
Now, the King at this time fell very ill,
and it was not long before they buried him,

and Dodo ascended to the throne with Zalia as
the Queen.
It seemed now that there w’as nothing ant-
ing to satisfy Zalia s ambitions.
Was she not Queen ? Did she not rule over
a kingdom with handsome courtiers bowing
to her on every side? With blazing jewels
to decorate her person! Yes! She had every-
thing her heart desired, so she needs must turn
to more mischief.
She was very curious to find out if the rest
of the Golden Slate’s prophecies would come
about, so, for the first time in many months,
she visited the palace garden and sought the
Orchid.
There it bloomed more beautiful than ever.
Zalia knelt before the flower and whispered:
“Tell me Flower, if my Lord loves me."
And the Orchid answered:
“In thy heart lieth the answer!”
Zalia was baffled and furious, and was about
to tear the Orchid out of the ground by the
roots when she remembered the words of the
spell. No! She did not wish Veva to regain
her shape, so instead she went back to the
palace, resolved to tell the Court of her sur-
prise in finding a Magic Orchid in the gardens
which answered any question put to it.
The King, in great interest, rushed to the
garden, and, beholding the glorious bloom,
cried:
“Oh, Flower divine, is Veva dead?”
And the Orchid answered in a clear, melo-
dious voice:
“Dead to thee, O King; thou hast taken
another bride."
And the king buried his face in his hands,
sad and ashamed.
The news of the wonderful flower then
spread all over the country, and many came
from distant lands to test its wisdom, and
went away satisfied. But the people’s wonder
reached its height when, at the touch of its
fragrant petals, a blind child regained its
sight. Crowds came with their ailments, their
deformities and went away cured. Thousands
asked questions of the Orchid, and were
answered to their satisfaction. Troubles were
wiped out, sickness healed. In truth, the
Orchid became so famous that a convoy from
a neighbouring city insisted upon building a
golden railing round it, and proclaimed that
should anyone harm the Magic Flower their
heads would answer for the offence.
Zalia felt perfectly safe as these things pro-
gressed, and her position was so assured that
she even felt a little sorry for the enchanted
Princess.

King Dodo haunted the garden with his
presence, and for hours would sit before the
Orchid gazing at it with enraptured eyes, but
he never spoke, for he knew he had done a
wrong action in wedding again. His love
for Veva never left him. So he continued
his reign, sad at heart, but ruling his subjects
in a kind and just manner, so that all loved
This state of affairs went on for many
months, and a little son was born to Zalia
and Dodo.
Great were the rejoicings at the advent ol
the little heir. Dodo named him Veva after
his first love, and worshipped the little chap
with a love scarcely human.
Wicked Zalia died, with the secret of Prin-
cess Veva’s enchantment unuttered on her lips,
and Dodo was left alone with his little son.
The Great Orchid bloomed more gloriously
than ever, and when alone from the thousands
who sought it would gently cry to herself:
“Forgotten, forgotten must I lie.
Would it were in my power to die;
1 cannot reveal myself to my Lord,
1 must say nothing of my own accord.
It was indeed a very sad fate for a lovely
Princess, and it looked as though she would
bloom for ever. She had special gardeners,
who tended her reverently, and special maidens
who watered her carefully. Never had
there been a flower so well preserved in the
history of the country; but in the flower s
heart there dwelt only sorrow—a sorrow that
could not be stilled.
So the years wore on until little Prince
Veva was six years old. He was the joy ot
Dodo’s heart, and the sunshine of the palace.
Now, the little fellow loved the gardens
and often would pull his father by the hand
to the nook where the Orchid grew.
“What flower is this, dear Father? he
would say.
“It is an Orchid, my son.”
“And why is it shut up within this golden
fence?” inquired the little fellow.
“Because it is a Magic Orchid, and answers
any question you care to ask it.
“Will it answer me?”
“Why, yes, to be sure.”
So the little fellow turned and spoke to the
Orchid: “Do you like me, Pretty Flower?
And the Orchid answered:
“Oh, who could help it, little boy.
To love you is the greatest joy.
“See, papa, she said she loved me. ex

Now, Prince Veva was so taken up with the

“Where did you live before you came here,

The little fellow hunted round for a garden

The flower answered not.

if deliverance was at hand.

“Oh, darling little Prince, you have saved
me from a hideous spell. For seven years have
I been an Orchid who could not reveal itself,
and now, by your kindly action, I am free.
Come, let us go together and seek the King.
And the little Prince, his eyes as big as saucers,
put his arms around the Princess’s neck and
she carried him towards the palace.
The Orchid’s heart sank. She could not
order the little Prince to destroy her. She
could only answer his questions.

Now, about this time King Dodo fell
seriously ill, and poor Prince Veva was locked
out of his room. The childish heart was burst-
ing with anxiety, and he went about the palace
with tearful eyes and aching breast. His
father grew worse and worse, so he sought
solace with his Orchid.
When the retainers and ladies-in-waiting
saw Veva they turned pale with fear, but she
smiled on them sweetly and told them of her
enchantment while they stood in wonderment.
At last she reached the King’s chamber and
gently entered. When the sick Dodo saw his
lovely child clasped to his dead Princess he
was stupefied, and wondered if it were a
dream; but when she came closer and kissed
his hands he realised she had come back to
him. With a great cry of joy he clasped her
to his heart, and listened to her tale in horror
and dread. He found it difficult to forgive the
dead Queen Zalia, but for the sake of their
little son, in time, forgot her wickedness, and
when he regained his strength he proclaimed
Princess Veva the Queen of the country 7 , and
they both lived for many years in peace and
harmony.
“My father is ill, terribly ill,” he cried.
“He might die. Would you be sorry, too, if
he died?” and the child’s eyes overflowed.
The Orchid’s heart almost broke at this
tragic news, and she longed to tell the Prince
* of her misfortune, but could not. Oh, why
did he not pluck her and have done with it?
Why must she remain in the garden when
she could be with her love to comfort and

“How can I save my father? Tell me,
Flower, how can I save him?” wailed the
little Prince in anguish.
The Orchid’s heart leapt, and, with tear*
