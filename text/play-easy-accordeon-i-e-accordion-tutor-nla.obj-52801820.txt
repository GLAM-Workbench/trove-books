No. I
How to Hold the Accordeon
The Accordeon is rested on the left
knee, the right hand fingering the keys
and the left hand the bass accompani-
ment and air valve.
8.2996.
Allan & Co., Melbourne,


No. II
How to Finger the Keys
The thumb of the right hand must be
placed in the leather strap so as to give
sufficient control in drawing out and
pushing in bellows while at the same
time leaving the fingers free to operate
the keys.
82996.
Allan & Co., Meioourne t


No. III
The Bass or Accompaniment Valves
These are worked by the fourth and
first fingers of the left hand. They are
used at the discretion of the performer,
but usually in waltz time (I time) the
bass is used once and the top key twice
In march time the bass would sound
once and the top key three times, acc-
ording to the nature of the item.
The Air Valve
This valve is situated behind the
Bass or Accompaniment Valves. It is
operated by the thumb of the left hand
and is used to empty or fill the bellows
when required.


N O. IV
The Stops
By a simple arrangement the tone of
the Accordeon can be made softer or
more powerful by adjusting the stops at
end of key board. Pulling out a stop
brings into use an extra set of reeds
which can be again thrown out of use
by pushing the stop in. In this way with
an Accordeon of three sets of reeds and
three stops, the tone of the instrument
can be varied in five different ways

THE ACCORDEON
Instructions for Playing the Accordeon
The Instrument should be firmly held in the right
hand, and the bellows drawn with the left.
The figures (1 23456789 10) in the following
Scales and Melodies denote the keys to be used in
forming the different notes.
When the sign 0 is placed over a figure, the bellows
must be drawn outwards
When no sign is marked the bellows must be pressed
inward.
Scale for the Accordeon
Stroke between figures denotes end of each bar.
Time
The duration of a note depends on its particular
shape or form. The different kinds of notes are;
The Semibreve o [count 4] The Minim J [count 2]
The Crotchet J [count 1]
The Quaver [2 quavers to a crotchet]
The Semiquaver [4 semiquavers to a crotchet]
8.2996.
Allan & Co., Melbourne,


Rests express silence of a duration equal to the notes
of the same name.
A dot placed after a note or rest, makes its time
half as long again, i.e..
The Various Species of Time
Whatever the number of notes or rests in a bar. their
collective value always amounts to exactly the same in
each, according to the species of Time in which the music
is written. A double bar stroke indicates the close of a
strain or movement, and a dot and curved line drawn
over it, the end of the composition or a pause in the music.
The letter C, or figures such as I. f &c.. &c. at the
commencement of each section of a composition is called
the Time Signature, and indicates the species of Time
in which it is written.
Time is classed under two general kinds, technically
called “Common” and “Triple”; the bar in the various
species of Common Time consisting of two or four equal
parts; Triple Time, of three parts only. These two
species of Time are also further divided into two kinds —
viz : simple and compound, and may be explained as
follows.
8.2996.
Allan & Co., Melbourne,


Simple Common Time
Indicates that each Bar contains a Semi-
breve or its equal in Time Value.
Indicates that each Bar_contains 2 Crot-
chets or their equal in Time Value.
Compound Common Time
Indicates that each Bar contains 6 Quavers
or their equal in Time Value.
Simple Triple Time
Indicates that each Bar contains 3 Crot-
chets or their equal in Time Value.
Indicates that each Bar contains 3 Quavers
or their equal in Time Value.
Method of Counting Time
The observance of the following rule in the mode of
counting time, atone leads to the correct interpretation
of music, viz.;— Count each species of Time according to
the number of parts, or, (as generally termed) heats con-
tained in the bar ; thus “Common Time” must be counted
by either two or four, and “Triple Time” by three only.
