TASMANIA.
INFORMATION FOR INTENDING EMIGRANTS.
Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the
Australian Continent between 40° and 44° South
Latitude, and 144° and 149° East Longitude. It is
divided from the Colony of Victoria by Bass’s Straits,
120 miles wide. The surface is diversified by ranges of
hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains ; and
it is probably the most healthy of all the British Colonies,
for it is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter
for out-door occupations to be carried on.
The rain fall, on an average, is a little more than 22
inches ; but there are not more than 40 days on which
out-door work cannot be done.
Telegraphic communication has been established be-
tween Hobart Town and Launceston, and connecting all
the principal Towns and Villages in the Island.
There is also an electric cable between Tasmania and
Victoria, —from whence land-lines extend to New South
Wales, Queensland, and South Australia; and a line
from Adelaide (in South Australia) extending across
to Port Darwin connects the colony with England.
Regular postal communication exists throughout the
colony, the postage on town letters being Id ; on country
letters, 2d. ; to the other colonies, 3d; and to Great
Britain, 6d
There is no postage whatever on newspapers either in
the colony or to any of the Australian Colonies or Great
Britain.
There is a four-weekly mail service with Great Britain,
via Galle, and mails for the Australasian Colonies are
despatched by every steamer leaving Hobart Town and
Launceston.
The post-office money-order system is in force.
A powerful passenger steamer plies twice a-month be-
tween Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales,
and Hobart Town; and one twice a-month between
Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria, and Hobart Town;
and two eight times a-month between Launceston and
Melbourne.
The Island contains 15! million acres of land, and
the islands connected with it contain I 4 million acres :
3,905,485 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by
the Crown ; leaving the Crown land property at about
12,000,000 acres, of which one and a half million acres
are leased by settlers for sheep-runs or other purposes.
There is a railway in course of construction to connect
the two ports of Hobart Town and Launceston, and
railway communication has for some time been established
between Launceston and Deloraine. This line passes for
45 miles through some of the best agricultural lands of the
colony.
The lowest upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture
is fixed by Act of Parliament at £1 an acre, and the
lowest upset price of pastoral lands at a sum equal to 12
years’ rental, but not less than ss. an acre.
Any person may select for purchase, by private contract
with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not
exceeding 320 acres, at £1 an acre, on the following
terms, as exemplified to the extent of 100 acres :
£ s. d.
100 acres at 20s 100 0 0
Add |rd for credit 33 6 8
£133 6 8

„ First year 5 0 0
~ Second year 5 0 0
„ Third, and following
years,up to 14 years 10 0 0 a-year.
And so in proportion for any greater or smaller area than 100 acres.
Credit is allowed on all purchases above ,£l5.
When 500 acres shall have been sold in not less than
10 lots adjoining or close to each other, the Governor-in-
Council is empowered to raise a sum not exceeding half
of such purchase-money for the purpose of constructing
a road or roads in the vicinity of the lots.
After paying the expenses of the Lands and Works
Department, one-fourth of the Land Revenue and
Licence Fees are set apart for the construction of roads
and bridges by the various Road Trustees.
By the Acts of Parliament, 31 Yict. No. 26, and 38
Yict. No. 16, the Board of Immigration in Tasmania are
empowered to appoint agents in England for the purpose
of selecting emigrants, and arranging for their convey-
ance to Tasmania. These agents- have also power to
issue warrants for land on the following terms :
The agents shall issue to each approved emigrant who
has not previously resided in the colony, and who pays
the full cost of his family’s passage out, a Warrant, which
will entitle the holder to receive from the Immigration
Agent in Tasmania a Land Order to the value of ,£lB for
each member of the family above 15 years of age, and
£9 for each member above 12 months and under 15 years
old; —and these Land Orders will be received by the
Government as payment for any Crown lands that the
emigrant may buy after his arrival.
The Acts also empower the Immigration Board to
permit any person who has paid his own and family’s
passage-money as cabin or intermediate passengers to
demand, within a year after his arrival in the Colony,
a land Certificate entitling him to select 30 acres of land
for himself, 20 for his wife, if he has one, and 10 for
each child.
And for these lands a grant will issue after five years*
residence; but the order will not be forfeited by the
death of the emigrant, or his absence, if his family
remain in the Colony.
Licences are granted to cut timber on Crown lands.
Licences to dig in search of gold are also issued.
Mineral Leases are issued for working lodes and
deposits of coal, iron, tin, &c. Of the latter metals
considerable shipments of pig iron and ingots of tin have
been made to Yictoria and the United Kingdom.


The prospects of successfully working the iron and tin
mines, and also the extensive coal-fields known to exist
in various parts of the Colony, are very encouraging.
Licences for pastoral lands are issued at rates having
regard to the class of the land and the number of sheep
and cattle which can be fed thereon, the rent being calcu-
lated on the carrying capacity of the land, at the rate of
from id. to B d. per annum for each sheep, or 2s. to 4s.
a-head for cattle.
The Board of Immigration issue bounty tickets to
persons residing in the Colony desirous of introducing
their relations or friends. The prices of the tickets being,
for a “ family ticket,” to introduce a man and his wife,
and all their children under 12 years of age, £l5; for
a single man, £10; and for a single female, £5.
Each single person over 12 years of age at the time of
embarkation must have a separate ticket.
Vessels are constantly leaving London and Liverpool
for Melbourne, the agents for which accept these tickets
and provide a free passage for the holders, the balance of
the passage money being paid by the Board, and the
emigrants are landed at Hobart Town or Launceston
free of expense to themselves.
Two daily and several Other newspapers are published
in Hobart Town, and four in Launceston.
The population of Tasmania is 104,217, of whom
55,117 are males, and 49,059 females. The death-rate
of 1874 was 16 per 1000 of the population. The
black aboriginal population is reduced to one, a woman
about 70 years of age. The number of houses at the
date of the last Census in February, 1870, was 20,364.
By the same census it appears that three hundred and
sixteen churches and chapels have been erected in various
parts of the colony, and the religious wants of the popu-
lation are provided for by a large body of earnest minis-
ters of all denominations.
“ Few islands in the world can compare with Tasmania
for salubrity. The temperature is so genial, and the air
so pure, that the diseases which in England add so much to
the general death-rate have here a minimum of intensity.
“No part of the world is perhaps more favourable to
infant life than Tasmania. About nine out of every ten
children survive the first year of life, and the mortality
from that age up to about fourteen years old decreases at
a wonderful rate. The deaths in 1000 children between
3 and 14 years old only average about five per thousand
annually.”— Dr. E. S. Hall, F. of Statist, and Epid.
Socty.
In addition to four principal grammar schools there
are numerous private establishments, as well as 150
government schools under the Board of Education,
having over 11,000 scholars on the rolls. Several
Scholarships are maintained by the%Jolony, the best being
two annual Tasmanian Scholarships of the value of £2OO
per annum each, provided by the Government, and
tenable at a British University for four years.
There are in addition thirty-two exhibitions from the
public schools under the Board of Education to either of
the four superior schools above mentioned, and tenable for
four years.
The system of education in Tasmania is such that the
son of the poorest person, if the boy possesses talent, may
progress step by step, aided by the Exhibitions and
Scholarships provided by the Government, till he obtains
the means of securing an University education in the
-mother country.
Working Men’s Clubs, Odd Fellows and Good
Templars’ Societies, Temperance Societies, Bible So-
cieties, Freemasons’ Lodges, Agricultural and Pastoral
Associations, Gardeners’ Societies, City Mission, Hos-
pitals for the Sick and for the Insane, Benevolent
Societies, an Asylum for Orphans, Asylums for the
Destitute, Boys’ Home, Female Industrial School Re-
formatory, &c., &c., have been established, and are in
active operation.
PRACTICAL HINTS TO EMIGRANTS.
Tasmania is a colony wherein the small capitalist can
find ready and remunerative return for his investments,
and the steady farm labourer and the industrious domestic
servant can get comfortable places with good wages!
To these three classes the information herein contained
is alone intended to apply.
First, then, the Small Capitalist is reckoned to be
a man having three or four hundred pounds in hand,
after paying his family’s passage-money to Tasmania,
and who wishes to become a farmer on his own account.
The most secure and expeditious way of bringing out
money is by an order on one of the banks here, which
can be readily obtained at the head offices in London.
The person should first of all call upon the Agents for
Tasmania in London, who will give him information as
to how he should act. These Agents are The Emigrant
and Colonists’ Aid Corporation (Limited), 3, Queen
Square, Westminster.
On landing in Tasmania, and taking lodgings accord-
to his means, the emigrant should at once call on the
Immigration Agent at Hobart Town, who will give him
advice, and refer him to the Surveyor-General for infor-
mation as to the land regulations,—the extent and locality
of available land, —the prices and regulations of sale, —
and the name and residence of the surveyor of the dis-
trict in which the emigrant may decide to settle. If
this should be in Northern Tasmania, he can apply to
the Launceston Immigration Agent, or to the Deputy-
Commissioner of Crown Lands, who has in his pos-
session all charts, &c. of the Northern Counties. He is
advised to place a certain sum in one of the Savings Banks
as a stand-by, for which he will receive 4 per cent, interest.
Emigrants are advised not to cumber themselves
before sailing with large agricultural implements. These
can be obtained in the colony better adapted to the rough
lands on which they are to be used. Seeds of all sorts
are cheaper than in England, and more likely to be pure
and genuine than those sent out to the colony, which are
almost always damaged or adulterated.
From forty to fifty shillings will suffice to clear from
underwood and grass an acre of good selected land, and
to ring or bark the big trees; reserving to a future day
the task of cutting them down or burning.
The average crop from rich newly cultivated land is
25 bushels of wheat, 25 of barley, 26 of oats, potatoes 3
to 10 tons. These, however, have been very largely ex-
ceeded in good seasons and good situations, viz., 50 bushels
wheat, 60 barley, 100 bushels oats, 15 tons potatoes, 37
tons carrots, 70 tons of mangolds. Individual specimens
of mangolds 126 lb. weight, turnips 90 lb., carrots 18 lb.,
potatoes 5 lb., and pumpkins of 120 lb., have been exhibited
in Hobart Town. If the farmer is a worker, his crop
ought to be ready for market soon after his second
instalment is due. A sufficient cottage can be erected
in the bush for about £SO; and while his wife managed
the household cookery and the children, the father and
the boys could use their bill-hooks according to size, and
then burn off at night the rubbish collected by dav. Of
course all have to work. The richest settlers in Tasmania,
who have made their thousands, have not been idlers.
Many a rich settler knows how to drive and hold a plough,
and has done it for years ; many a rich settler’s wife
knows how to cook a dinner for the farming men, and
has done it for years; and such knowledge, once acquired,
is always ready for occasion.
Upon the head of tillage, it is a man’s own fault, if, in an
average of seasons, he be not abundantly repaid fer what-
ever he does in cultivating the earth. For all sorts of grain
that are usual in Great Britain—such as wheat, barley,
oats, rye, and for various kinds of pulse—both the soil
and climate are wonderfully well adapted ; and, where
proper tillage has been attended to, the returns have
always proved satisfactory. Where the land has been


properly worked and rotation of crops attended to—-the
ground cleared of stumps and other obstructions—the
growing crop preserved by a fence ; where, in fact,
industry and care have been manifested, the returns
may be safely set down as equal to those derived per acre
from the fair average land of the Mother Country. Not,
however, in quantity only, but in quality, is the grain
of Tasmania all that a farmer need desire. Few samples
of wheat yield less than from sixty-two to sixty-four
pounds per bushel—the average standard of sixty pounds,
at which it is purchased by the public, being invariably
found in favour of the grower; and when it comes to the
meal tub it is found to be rather above the best wheat of
English growth in the comparative quantity of bread pro-
duced from the same quantity of flour.
Certain soils in this colony are peculiarly favorable to
the culture of the potatoe, and this esculent occupies a
considerable amount of attention at the hands of some
agriculturists.
Mangel wurzel and turnips are cultivated in nearly
. every part of the colony, and are found to answer
extremely well.
The climate of Tasmania is peculiarly adapted for
fruit growing, and there is a very large export trade in
green fruits, apples especially, amounting in the twelve
months ending 30th April, 1875, to 145,948 bushels.
Among the fruits grown in the innumerable orchards and
gardens, the produce of which forms the main support
of many industrious families, may be mentioned apples,
pears, plums, peaches, apricots, strawberries, raspberries,
walnuts, gooseberries, currants, cherries, &c., &c.
The small fruits are extensively converted into jams
and jellies, of which last season’s export exceeded 1200
tons from Hobart Town.
All kinds of vegetables are grown with success, and
find a ready sale in the towns.
The next class to which advice is tendered is that of
the Agricultural or Farm Labourer.
A steady man can obtain from 10s. to 15s. a week
wages, with quarters or a cottage, firing, water, and the
following weekly rations of food, which vary on different
farms, but are fully as follows 10 to 12 lbs. of meat,
14 lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of sugar, J lb. tea, and he is
generally allowed a bit of good ground for his vegetable
garden. He has only to show an interest in his master’s
service, and be sober and honest, and his labours will
be duly appreciated. He has visiting clergymen, if not
close to a church; he has public schools in every
district, open to his children at about 6d. per week;
and medical men practising throughout the colony—these
latter, however, do not flourish in the healthy "interior.
His hours of labour are not more than 60 a week at the
furthest; and during shearing time or harvest there is
always remunerative employment for his children down
to 9 or 10 years of age, especially in the Hop-growing
Districts and during the Hop-picking season. There
is also a good demand for boys of 12 to 14, who have
gained a slight knowledge of farming and milking.
The third and last class is the Household Servant,
whose labours are the same here as in England, but whose
wages and advantages are much greater. A respectable
female servant can get from £2O to £3O a year according
to her abilities, and good cooks and laundresses are much
wanted; wages are usually paid monthly; the alternate
Sunday afternoon out is commonly allowed, with occa-
sional holidays ; and, if well behaved and proper in her
conduct, she enjoys almost a certainty of getting a re-
spectable man for a husband.
A good sober man servant in a household receives high
wages, it he is inclined to make himself generally useful.
But one thing is necessary to all emigrants on their
arrival in Tasmania, and that is, to avoid loitering about
the public-houses with their attractions. The colonial
ale is excellent in its quality and reasonable in price.
The emigrant who has a due regard to the interests o t
his family will avail himself of that great colonial Life
Assurance Company, the Australian Mutual Provident
Society, which has upwards of 20,000 members in the
Colonies, and an income of .£360,000 a year, with
£1,500,000 invested in Government and other securities ;
or in the branch of the Liverpool, London, and Globe
Company, both of which have large numbers of insurers
in Tasmania. The Directors and Agents of these Com-
panies and other Provident Societies are well known;
and, for a few shillings a month, a father of a family can
make provision to protect his wife and children from want
when he shall be no longer able to do so.
The classes of the population more especially required
in Tasmania at present are :
1. Men with capital to invest.
2. Agricultural labourers, or persons accustomed to
field labour or dairy farming, and miners.
3. Domestic servants, either male or female.
There are plenty of clerks, book-keepers, dressmakers,
and needle-women, shopmen and shopwomen.
Life and property are as secure as in Great Britain.
All our native trees and shrubs are evergreen, and the
smaller shrubs are mostly aromatic, and bear beautiful
and variously-coloured flowers. “ The English-looking
cottages, snug farm-houses, large mansions surrounded
by cultivated fields, the neat villages, and prominently
placed churches, make the scenery very English, and
altogether point to Tasmania as the Britain of the
South.”— Sir Paul de Strzelecki, K. C. M. 6f.
