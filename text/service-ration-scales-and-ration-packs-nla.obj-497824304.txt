CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Fighting fitness cannot be maintained unless the body is receiving
an adequate diet. An adequate diet is one that provides sufficient
calories to meet bodily requirements, as well as certain quantities of
various essential nutrients, comprising proteins, mineral salts and
vitamins.
CALORIES
The energy that is released from any food, during its breakdown
in the body, is measured in calories. Hence, calories are a measure of
energy in the same way that inches are a measure of length.
The number of calories provided by different foods varies greatly.
In general, the higher the fat content of a food, the greater the number
of calories it provides. Because water provides no calories, watery foods
and especially beverages and drinks, are comparatively low in calories.
Hence, butter and margarine, which are mostly fat, provide about 210
calories per ounce, whereas apples and oranges, which contain large
amounts of water, provide less than 15 calories per ounce.
The energy expended by the body during physical activity, such as
breathing, eating or marching, can also be measured in calories. The
more strenuous the exercise, the greater the number of calories expended.
For instance, the energy expended in running at a speed of 4i miles
per hour, is about 480 calories per hour, whereas the energy expended
in typing, at the rate of 40 words per minute, is only about 30 calories
per hour. In general, large men expend more energy than small men
engaged on the same kind of activity.
During the release of energy for physical activity, there is also an
accompanying release of energy in the form of heat. This assists in
maintaining the temperature of the body and it is for this reason that
people, when the weather is very cold, sometimes clap their hands or
stamp their feet to keep warm. If physical activity is too strenuous, the
body may become overheated in which case the sweat glands become
operative in an attempt to cool the body.
From these brief remarks it will be evident that energy supplied to
the body in the form of food may be used for the performance of
physical activity, or to keep the body warm. If the body consumes more
calories than it uses for physical activity and warmth, the excess will


be stored in fat depots, and the body will increase in weight. On the
other hand, if the body consumes less calories than it uses, bodily
reserves will be drawn upon to provide energy for physical activity and
warmth, and the body will decrease in weight. If the number of
calories consumed by the body is equal to the number expended, there
will be no change in body weight.
It is important that all men and women serving in the Armed
Forces attain the weight at which they perform best. This will also be
the weight at which they look and feel best. By the regular consumption
of an adequate ration that provides the correct number of calories, this
weight can be maintained indefinitely. Best performance cannot
normally be achieved by a person who is underweight or overweight.
The total number of calories required by a man, 25 years of age,
weighing about 145 pounds and living in a temperate climate has been
estimated at about 3,000 per day. This covers the requirement for a
man engaged on activities that do not include more than occasional
periods of hard physical work. If he is engaged on hard physical work
for the whole of his working day, the total number of calories required
would be much greater. For a woman, 25 years of age, weighing about
120 pounds and living under the same conditions as the man, the total
number of calories required has been estimated at about 2,200 per day.
This covers the requirement for a woman engaged on moderately light
duties. If she is engaged on clerical work for the whole of the working
day, the total number of calories would be lower.
The number of calories provided by a ration may be used as an
indication of its quantitative adequacy. There is no unit as simple as
the calorie for measuring quality, as this depends on the presence of
adequate amounts of a large number of nutrients including proteins,
mineral salts and vitamins. To ensure that the daily intake of food
contains necessary amounts of all these nutrients, food guides have been
prepared.
FOOD GUIDES
Food guides divide foods into various groups and specify the
minimum quantities that should be consumed from each group every
day. For the layman, food guides usually divide foods into five groups,
namely:—
(a) Milk and milk substitutes.
(b) Bread and cereal products.
(c) Fresh fruits and vegetables.
(d) Meats and their substitutes.
(e) Butter and table margarine.


When, however, the food guide is to be used by the Armed Forces,
the last group may be omitted on the understanding that butter and
margarine will be provided to complete meals and give additional
energy as required. In this case, it is important that the provision of
green leafy and yellow vegetables be adequate, otherwise the ration may
be deficient in certain vitamins.
For the basic part of a ration, foods should be consumed every
day from the four broad food groups, and in the quantities, indicated
hereunder. In addition, other foods should be consumed to provide
sufficient calories and make meals more attractive and satisfying. It
is important, however, to consume at least the minimum number of
servings from each of the following four food groups every day. This
will ensure that the ration provides sufficient protein, mineral salts and
vitamins.
Milk and Milk Substitutes
About two cups of fresh milk, holding 6 oz each, or an equivalent
amount of a substitute milk food, should be consumed each day. Whole
milk contains all essential nutrients, although some in comparatively
small amounts. Fresh milk is not necessary if an equivalent amount
of evaporated or powdered whole or skim milk is used in the preparation
of certain menu items. Other less satisfactory substitutes for fresh
milk include cream and ice-cream. Cream contains all the solids in
whole milk but with the fatty solids greatly increased. In addition to
milk solids, ice-cream contains an appreciable amount of cane sugar.
Bread and Cereal Products
At least two servings of bread, or other nutritious cereal products,
should be consumed every day, one medium-sized slice of bread,
weighing H oz, or half a cup of cooked cereal, being taken as one
serve. Ordinary white bread is a nutritious food but wholemeal bread
is more nutritious because it contains more vitamins and other
nutrients. In fact, this applies to all baked goods made from wholemeal
flour. Porridge, spaghetti, macaroni, noodles and rice are other cereal
products with high nutritive values. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals
are enriched with various nutrients; others, though palatable, have low
nutritive values.
Fresh Fruits and Vegetables
From this group, there should be four or more servings, each at
least 3 oz, consumed every day. These should include citrus fruits or
tomatoes, and a green leafy or yellow vegetable, such as cabbage or
carrots, or a fruit, such as apricots or cantaloup. Potatoes, because of
the large quantities eaten, can become quite important sources of certain


vitamins. Their nutritive value is highest when cooked in their skins.
Vegetables of outstanding food value are broccoli, cabbage, carrots,
cauliflower and turnips. On the other hand, there are many fruits with
a higher food value than apples, whose principal virtue appears to be
in giving bulk to the diet. Most fruits and vegetables are important
because of the vitamins and minerals they contain.
Meats and Meat Substitutes
One or more servings, equivalent to 4 oz or more of lean cooked
meat, should be consumed each day. Meats may include beef, veal,
mutton and lamb as well as fish. Livers, hearts and kidneys are also
valuable meat foods. Substitutes include eggs, cheese, nuts and nut
foods such as nut meat and peanut butter. The foods in this group are
of particular value because of their protein contents. They also provide
fat, mineral salts and vitamins. The fat content of meat depends
largely on the degree to which the meat is trimmed. Even carefully
trimmed meat contains some fat.


CHAPTER 2
SERVICE RATION SCALES
Service feeding is planned to provide a nutritionally adequate diet
in a form that is most acceptable to service personnel. It must,
therefore, conform to the feeding patterns to which service men and
women are accustomed.
In Australia, there is no basic difference between the feeding
patterns of service personnel and civilians in the same age brackets.
Both patterns provide three main meals per day. Snacks during mid-
morning and mid-afternoon, and light suppers, are common features
of both patterns and the popularity of this “between meal” consumption
of food appears to be increasing. As long as there is no increase in
overall food consumption, the trend has much to recommend it.
The three main meals are usually built around meat, which is the
principal source of animal protein. Breakfast may consist of fruit
juice, a cereal food and main meat or egg dish. Tea and toast are
insufficient and would be soon followed by a decrease in efficiency and
reduced work output. Most messes provide a two-course midday meal,
but, in many instances, it is better if the selection of food is confined to
one course, with meat as the main component. Large midday meals
frequently result in lassitude and a disinclination for any form of physical
or mental activity. Dinner at night may consist of three courses,
comprising soup, a main meat course with vegetables, and a sweet. It
should be the largest meal of the day, unless it is to be followed by an
evening exercise when a smaller meal is preferable.
At one time, morning and afternoon tea breaks were not popular
because of the loss in man-hours that resulted. However, it is now
known that morning and afternoon teas, accompanied by a small amount
of solid food, increase general efficiency during the latter part of the
morning and afternoon. A light supper tends to promote sounder sleep
and reduces the overnight period during which no food is consumed.
Nevertheless, to prevent over-eating, the introduction of “between meal”
snacks must be accompanied by a reduction in the amounts of food
consumed at the three main meals.
Although climatic conditions in Australia vary over a wide range,
from tropical in the north to sub-temperate in the south, climate has
little influence on feeding habits. Hot meals are almost as popular in
the north as they are in the south; likewise, there is little difference
in the popularity of salads and other cold dishes. This is not surprising.


A hot meal provides comparatively few calories because of its
temperature, most calories being provided when various nutrients, of
which a meal is composed, are broken down in the body to provide
energy for physical activity and warmth. Nevertheless, service rationing
makes some provision for the small difference in food preferences that
occur in the warmer parts of Australia.
Differences in feeding patterns that result from differences in racial
customs and religious beliefs are not very marked in Australia, and with
one exception, do not greatly affect rationing or menu-planning in the
Defence Forces. The exception requires fish, instead of meat, to be
served on Fridays for Catholics. Asians and descendants of Asian
nationals may prefer rice rather than bread as a daily staple, and some
do not eat meat, but the number of men entering the services, or
undergoing service training in Australia, who require Asian type
meals, is too small to create a problem. Nevertheless, provision is
made for them. Other racial groups requiring special meals are of
even less significance.
Hence, it is apparent that, as far as the defence forces in Australia
are concerned, there are no distinctly different feeding patterns that
apply to particular parts of Australia, or to appreciable sections of
service personnel. Somewhat similar conditions are assumed to exist
when Australian service men are stationed overseas. This greatly
simplifies service feeding which is further assisted by the fact that
service men and women fall within an age group that excludes the very
young and very old. Because of this, service feeding can be based
on comparatively simple ration scales. Despite their simplicity, these
scales provide a wide variety of foods which give ample scope for
providing attractive meals.
RATION SCALES
In Service language, a ration is the food provided for the
subsistence of one man for one day. The period of rationing is usually
from midnight to midnight.
A ration scale is a table which shows the amounts of various food
commodities of which a ration is comprised. It defines for the service
man his legal entitlement of food. Primarily, ration scales are designed
to ensure nutritional adequacy within a known and procurable range of
commodities.
Each ration scale authorizes the issue of specific quantities of
various food commodities for the feeding of each service man or woman.
It also authorizes alternatives, which may be issued when the prescribed


commodities are not available, or when additional variety is sought on
the menu. This facilitates supply-planning and procurement as well as
stabilizing menu-planning and food preparation. It also gives reasonable
discretion and scope to caterers and cooks.
There are three principal ration scales that have been approved
for use by Australian service men and women under certain conditions.
They are
(a) The Mainland Ration Scale, for use by service personnel on
the mainland of Australia with variations for service women
and school cadets, for Asian nationals serving in Australia,
and for personnel serving in northern parts of Australia.
(b) The Overseas Ration Scale (Peace), for use by Australian
service men serving overseas in peacetime, except where
special local ration scales are in existence.
(c) The Field Service Ration Scale, which is a scale for use by
service men in time of war.
These scales differ because they are designed for different supply
conditions. All provide rations that are nutritionally adequate. A
service man can only be in a state of maximum efficiency when his diet
is adequate and provides neither too much nor too little food. Whether
in peace or war, it is the purpose of all ration scales to provide
nutritionally adequate diets. It is only in the manner in which this is
achieved that the above scales differ.
In addition to the foregoing scales, special ration scales have been
devised to meet particular requirements, but the use of these scales is
limited. One of the most important of the special scales is that for
service men engaged in flying operations. Another covers the feeding
of natives in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. For medical
cases, there are special hospital diet scales.
Ration scales are designed to provide about 4000 calories per man
daily in the form of food available for consumption. For service men
engaged in clerical occupations this figure is high and, if the full ration
is consumed, overweight will soon result. For service men engaged in
fairly strenuous physical activity, and allowing for some degree of plate
waste, it is sufficient. In most messes, the smaller quantities of food
consumed by service men in sedentary occupations will more than
balance the larger quantities consumed by the few service men engaged
in particularly strenuous physical occupations. The provision of bread,
butter and jam on mess tables assists in making this adjustment.


When there are special ration scales for service women, these
scales would provide not less than about 3000 calories per woman
daily as food available for consumption. This figure is high and based
on the assumption that most service women are of larger physique, and
engaged on more strenuous physical activity, than civilian women within
the same age group. In localities where few service women are
stationed, and it would be administratively difficult to ration them
separately, the women are normally rationed in accordance with the
male scale.
It is essential that all unit “Q” staff and catering personnel
have a thorough knowledge of the ration scale, or scales, in use. This
knowledge should cover, not only commodity entitlements, but the
correct use of the many approved alternatives which are provided to
meet food preferences, as well as give variety. The intelligent application
of such knowledge can eliminate many grounds for complaint and
sometimes effect a general improvement in the standard of messing.
No effort should be spared to maintain effective liaison between quarter-
masters, supply officers, catering officers, and, for supplementary items,
canteen representatives in order to achieve this result.
In addition, all service personnel should have a working knowledge
of the ration scale according to which they are being fed. A knowledge
of this scale will enable them to make more intelligent suggestions
through the appropriate representative on the messing committee,
regarding general improvements in catering. This could eventually lead
to more attractive meals and more satisfied personnel. Copies of the
scale are not available for general distribution but an up-to-date copy
can be made available for perusal by the quartermaster or members of
the catering staff.
Where it is impracticable and/or uneconomical to provide rations
as such, certain alternative methods of feeding may be authorized.
These are principally in the form of financial allowances as set out
hereunder
(a) Allowances in lieu of rations.
(b) Bivouac allowances for CMF.
(c) Train feeding.
Mainland Ration Scale
The Mainland Ration Scale is the approved ration scale for Army
and RAAF personnel, and certain elements of Navy, on the mainland
of Australia. It contains special provision for personnel located in


northern Australia, for Asian personnel, for cadets, and for service
women when messing separately. It also permits extra commodities for
unusual conditions, and for adolescents comprising apprentices, band
boys and clerical trainees. The scale is designed to meet the full
nutritional needs of one person for one day, and is a maximum scale
of issue.
Listed in the scale are certain basic items under which there are
alternatives that may be issued instead. The many commodities listed
as alternatives enable greater variety to be provided, and should be
fully considered when suggestions are being made concerning the
preparation of menus. The selection of alternatives is confined to
groups containing foods of similar nutritional or culinary properties.
These groups, placed in alphabetical order, are as follows; beverages,
cereals, condiments, fats, fruits, meats, milk, risings, sugar and
vegetables. Foods in different groups cannot be interchanged. Fresh
fruits and vegetables are not specified in detail and, in the Army, the
various commands determine the issue of fresh fruits and vegetables
by types, in accordance with the season and their availability.
Service women are permitted greater quantities of beverage-
making commodities, and milk, but less oatmeal, or other breakfast
cereals, and fresh meat than service men. Cadets are permitted less
vegetables, fruit and bread, or biscuits, but greater quantities of some
other cereal foods, cheese and milk, Asian nationals are permitted
additional cooking oil, and greater latitude in obtaining rice as an
alternative to bread, and in their choice of meat, bacon or poultry.
Fruit juice, increased quantities of beverage-making commodities, and
sugar, with less cheese, and ice-cream mix as an adjunct, are permitted
in northern parts of Australia. To prevent monotony when certain
meats are difficult to obtain, poultry may be issued in place of lamb,
pork or veal in certain areas of northern Australia, with a limit of four
issues in every twenty-eight days.
Increases in certain commodities are permitted during the first four
days of a camp of continuous training, in cases of emergency when men
are employed on arduous duties or on work involving abnormal hours
of duty, and for personnel on craft proceeding to sea for periods in
excess of one day.
In addition to the ration scale, a supplementary ration allowance is
authorized for the purchase of extra foodstuffs and condiments. The
supplementary ration allowance is therefore, designed to augment the
Mainland Ration Scale, thus enabling further variations in the diet.
It should normally be confined to purchases of commodities not included
in the ration scale. The supplementary ration allowance is determined


by Treasury and varies from time to time in accordance with changes
in the cost of foodstuffs. The quartermaster is normally responsible for
its expenditure, acting on recommendations from the unit messing
committee.
As a means of exercising control over ration commodity usage,
the Australian Army has adopted the Basis of Issue Table, This table,
which is prepared by each command to meet local needs and conditions,
lays down the frequency with which specific commodities in the
Mainland Ration Scale will be used during a twenty-eight day ration
accounting period. Apart from enabling more attractive menus to be
provided and thus reducing wastage, the Basis of Issue Table facilitates
the task of central provisioning.
All items purchased for the feeding of service personnel on the
Mainland Ration Scale are of the highest quality. This is ensured by
strict adherence to Commonwealth Food Specifications. These
specifications are under constant revision by the Commonwealth Food
Specifications Committee on which there are representatives from the
three Services. The chairman is a senior official in the Department of
Primary Industry.
The Mainland Ration Scale is under constant revision. The body
responsible for the revision of ration scales is the Ration Scales
Committee which normally meets twice a year and, in addition to other
matters, considers recommendations from Army commands and RAAF.
Overseas Ration Scale (Peace)
The Overseas Ration Scale (Peace) is for use by personnel
stationed beyond the mainland of Australia, except under some
conditions where special local scales have been or will be prepared, or
where small detachments are integrated with units of other countries.
In the latter circumstances any deficiencies in the ration entitlements are
adjusted by allowances for the purchase of additional foodstuffs. Where
Australian units are rationed by another country, the Overseas Ration
Scale (Peace) normally forms the basis for special scales introduced
by that country for the purpose.
The Overseas Ration Scale (Peace) contains a number of basic
commodities associated with each of which there is a number of
alternatives that may be issued instead. The basic scale, with
alternatives, enables a normal feeding pattern to be followed with such
modifications as may be necessary to enable menus to be planned in
accordance with climatic conditions and the availability of supplies.
The scale is designed to provide a nutritionally adequate diet and is a
maximum scale of issue.


The Overseas Ration Scale (Peace) is more liberal in its provision
of beverage-making commodities than the Mainland Ration Scale. It
also permits, as an alternative to fresh vegetables, fruit juice which,
on the Mainland Ration Scale, is only on issue to cadets and other
personnel in northern parts of Australia. In other respects it closely
resembles the Mainland Ration Scale and is used in the same way. It
is not, however, supported by a supplementary ration allowance for the
purchase of additional foods and condiments, as it includes items which,
on the mainland of Australia, are normally purchased with this allowance.
In the Overseas Ration Scale (Peace), there is no provision for
the feeding of women serving overseas. Should the need arise, however,
immediate steps would be taken to prepare a modified scale more suitable
for the feeding of service women. In the meantime, overseas service
women are rationed in accordance with the male scale.
Unless commodities of satisfactory quality can be obtained overseas
where they are needed, that is, commodities that comply with
Commonwealth Food Specifications, all commodities in the Overseas
Ration Scale (Peace) are usually exported from Australia. This may
increase the cost of rationing but it safeguards the health of service
personnel which is of prime importance.
As for the Mainland Ration Scale, the Overseas Ration Scale
(Peace) is under constant review by the Ration Scales Committee.
Field Service Ration Scale
The Field Service Ration Scale is for use in time of war. Like the
two preceding ration scales, it consists of a number of basic commodities
with alternatives. It also makes provision for cigarettes, tobacco and
matches under certain conditions. Like the Overseas Ration Scale
(Peace), it is a complete scale and, consequently, is not supported by
a supplementary ration allowance.
The rationing objective in a theatre of operations is to supply as
many fresh foods as possible. This assists in providing meals, that
approach those normally provided, to the greatest possible extent.
However, when it is impracticable to provide a complete range of fresh
foods, for instance, when suitable refrigeration facilities are not available,
an increased proportion of non-perishables has to be included in the
ration. Under extreme conditions all fresh foods would be replaced by
processed foods. The Field Service Ration Scale makes allowance for
this.
In addition to providing a nutritionally adequate diet that is
generally acceptable to the service man, the components of the Field
Service Ration can be so chosen that they have good keeping qualities


under adverse conditions of transport and storage, and small bulk so
that a minimum of refrigeration is required. The packaging is
particularly robust to prevent damage due to rough handling and
infestation by rodents and insects. When the ration consists entirely of
processed foods, it requires little preparation, thus enabling troops to
prepare meals under difficult conditions, with a minimum of manpower
and cooking equipment.
The Field Service Ration Scale, like the Overseas Ration Scale
(Peace), does not make special provision for the feeding of service
women. Nevertheless, should the need arise, immediate steps would
be taken to produce a modified scale more suitable for this purpose.
Except for commodities, of satisfactory quality, that can be
purchased locally, all items required for the Field Service Ration are
normally imported into the theatre of operations.
As for the two preceding ration scales, the Field Service Ration
Scale is under constant review by the Ration Scales Committee.
Comparison of Ration Scales and Food Guide
In Table I, the quantities of various staple commodities in the
Mainland, Overseas and Field Service Ration Scales are compared with
the minimum consumption recommended in the Food Guide discussed
in Chapter 1. From this comparison it will be seen that all ration scales
meet these requirements and have thus been based on sound nutritional
principles.
For all food groups, except the first, each of the ration scales allows
much more than the recommended minimum daily consumption. Food
in excess of these minimum quantities is necessary to provide sufficient
calories for daily requirements. Considerable latitude may be allowed
in the choice of this extra food. The important matter is to consume
at least the minimum quantities of food given in the food guide.
In the first group, the entitlement for milk in the Field Service
Ration Scale is equivalent to a little more than 12 fl oz of fresh milk,
4 fi oz of unsweetened condensed milk usually being regarded as
nutritionally equivalent to 9 fl oz of fresh milk. In the Mainland
Ration Scale, the fresh milk allowance for service women and cadets
is 20 fl oz.
In the second group it will be noted that rice is a basic commodity
for the Overseas and Field Service Ration Scales but not for the
Mainland Ration Scale. A certain quantity of rice may, however, be

obtained as an alternative to flour on the Mainland Ration Scale. Asian
nationals may obtain as much as 6 2/3 oz of rice as an alternative to
10 oz bread. For cadets, the bread and flour entitlements are 9 and
3f oz respectively. The oatmeal entitlement for service women is I oz.
In the third group, the entitlement for fresh fruit, in the Overseas
Ration Scale, may appear low but, on this scale, an additional 10 2/3 oz
of fresh fruit may be drawn in place of 2oz of dried fruit. In the Field
Service Ration Scale, an additional 5 1/3 oz of fresh fruit may be


drawn in place of 1 oz of dried fruit. On the Mainland Ration Scale,
cadets are permitted 9 oz of fresh fruit and 10 oz of vegetables, other
than potatoes and onions. On all scales, an additional 4 oz of fresh
vegetables may be drawn in place of 1 oz of dried lentils.
In the fourth group, the Mainland Ration Scale permits only 14 oz
of fresh meat for service women and 4/9 oz of cheese for cadets and
personnel in northern Australia. Asian nationals are permitted 2oz of
meat in place of H oz of bacon. They are also permitted 1(H oz of
poultry (or 9i oz of turkey) as an alternative to 14 oz of lamb, pork or
veal on four in every twenty-eight days.
In the fifth group, the Mainland Ration Scale allows Asian
nationals an additional 1 fl oz of vegetable oil for cooking purposes.
Also, they may draw H fl oz of cooking oil as an alternative to H oz of
bacon.
From these comments it will be readily evident that the principal
ration scales used by the Australian Armed Forces have been developed
to a very high level in the provision of adequate and acceptable diets.


CHAPTER 3
COMBAT RATION PACKS
Ration scales are a convenient means of adequately feeding service
personnel grouped together in an area where the supplies position is
favourable and normal kitchen facilities are available. There are many
situations, however, for which supplies distribution has to be simplified,
and in which there are no kitchen facilities, so that feeding must be on
a party or individual basis. For these situations, ration packs are
required. There are a number of different ration packs but, those in
general use, form the group termed combat ration packs.
Combat ration packs are scientifically designed so that they provide
food of sufficient nutritive value for the purpose, or period, for which
they are intended. They can be prepared without heat or the addition
of water, although water will, of course, be needed for drinking purposes.
The individual components of each pack are chosen for their high
degree of acceptability, thus keeping wastage, and hence, the net weight
of each pack to a minimum. Acceptability has been determined by
troop feeding trials using representative groups of ARA and CMF
soldiers, both officers and other ranks. RAAF personnel has also been
used.
For complete ration packs, approximately 3500 calories per man
daily are provided. During tests conducted by the Army Food Science
Establishment at the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra in southern
Queensland, it was found that a soldier undergoing training in jungle
warfare required about 3450 calories per day. This was an average
figure. There would be some occasions when this number of calories
would be excessive, others when more calories would be required.
Provision is made for calories in excess of 3500 by the issue of a
supplementary ration component, which also serves as an emergency
ration. This ration can increase the caloric intake to about 4000
calories per day.
To ensure nutritional adequacy, the food components of complete
ration packs have been chosen to conform to the food guide, discussed
in Chapter 1, to the extent that this is possible in a ration pack.
Obviously, fresh, perishable foods cannot be included in ration packs
and, to compensate for this, selected foods have been fortified with
vitamins normally present in these foods. By this means, the total
quantities of protein, mineral salts and vitamins are the same as they
would be if fresh, perishable foods were included.


Combat ration packs must meet stringent stability requirements so
that they can be stockpiled for two years without any deterioration that
may result in loss of nutritive value, or noticeable decrease in palatability.
Because of this, there is only a limited number of items that can be
contained in a combat ration. Repeated use of ration packs can lead
to these items becoming monotonous with a gradual lowering of
acceptability and, eventually, a reluctance to eat certain items. This,
in turn, may result in insufficient food being consumed. The
consumption of insufficient food can result in a lowering of morale, as
well as a loss of calories and nutrients. The latter can reduce efficiency
and may, in the long run, diminish resistance to disease.
Combat ration packs are, therefore, not intended for use over long
periods in the same way as a ration provided in accordance with one
of the scales discussed in Chapter 2. They are intended for conditions
under which normal supplies are not available and organized messing
on a conventional basis is not possible. Such conditions arise when
infantry sub-units, tank and gun crews, patrols and similar small groups
deploy beyond the range of unit kitchens.
The combat ration packs have been primarily designed for
operational use in the tropical zone north and north-west of Australia.
The severe climatic and terrain conditions of this area, introduce logistical
aspects which also have a bearing on design and, in particular, packaging.
Factors such as the following were taken into account in designing
the various combat ration packs currently in use
(a) Reduced handling facilities in the theatre of war with heavy
demands on transportation throughout the lines of
communication.
(b) Increased dependence upon delivery by air, which might be
by any method, including free dropping on various kinds of
terrain.
(c) Stresses imposed on packaging by rough terrain and a variety
of modes of transportation, including pack animals and native
porters.
(d) Necessity, at times, for more than one day’s food to be
carried as a personal load and in addition to other equipment.
(e) Limited scope for the local procurement of foodstuffs largely
because many foods produced by indigenous populations are
unacceptable.
(f) Contamination of water by bacteria and fall-out, producing
problems in the provision of water for drinking purposes.

Contents of Combat Ration (10-Man)


(g) Interruption to the supplies system, both to and within the
theatre of operations, requiring the holding of increased
reserve stocks.
(h) Limited refrigeration and a reduced standard of storage
facilities, which offer less protection from flies, rats and other
vermin,
(j) Major spoilage hazards, resulting from the effect of tropical
temperatures on organisms that have escaped destruction
during processing.
(k) Increased dependence upon individual and small detachment
food preparation using primitive facilities.
The above points will serve to illustrate the paramount importance
of compactness, stability and adequate packaging in all combat ration
packs designed for tropical warfare conditions. With these points in
mind, three operational combat rations have been designed and tested
for use by the Australian service man. They are listed hereunder
(a) Combat Ration (10-man).
(b) Combat Ration (one-man).
(c) Emergency Ration,
With the combat ration (10-man) and combat ration (one-man),
the laborious and somewhat complicated task of issuing multiple
quantities of a large number of separate commodities is resolved into the
simple task of handing out the appropriate number of complete rations.
Furthermore, the food components of these packs can be eaten cold
without preparation or the addition of water. There is no need for
kitchen facilities, or a fire or any other form of heat. Nevertheless,
the packs are more palatable if heated and heat is, of course, necessary
if tea is to be made.
COMBAT RATION (10-MAN)
This ration pack, with the addition of bread or biscuits, contains
sufficient food for ten men for one day, or five men for two days. It
may also serve three men for three days, but usually with a high degree
of waste. It is intended for the feeding of small detachments under
conditions where organized messing is not possible.
Bread, or biscuits, is provided at the rate of 10 oz of bread per
man daily, or 6 2/3 oz of biscuits. Bread is always provided when
available. The biscuits are of a different type to those in the combat
ration (one-man), the former being designated Biscuits, service and the
latter Biscuits, ration.


The combat ration (10-man) is available in three types designated
“A”, “B” and “C”. Type “A” is marked with a broad red band around
the carton, type “B” by a blue band and type “C” a yellow. Although
the main food components are different in the three types, each has
approximately the same caloric and nutrient value. Details of the
components in each type may be changed from time to time, as advances
in food technology provide better products, but changes are less frequent
thlan with ration scales. The contents of the current combat ration
(10-man) are given in Table 11,
In addition to the main food items, it will be seen that each pack
contains the following sundry items salt, tea, soluble coffee, curry
powder, vegetable extract (such as Vegemite or Marmite), two can
openers, four reclosure lids, toilet paper, matches and soap. Soluble
coffee is included because it can be prepared without boiling water.
Curry powder and vegetable extract are for men who wish to prepare
special dishes or change the flavour of some foods. Two can openers
are included so that there will be one for each of the two parts into
which the pack is divided. The reclosure lids are provided so that
certain cans can be closed if the whole contents are not consumed at
one meal. The soap may be used for toilet purposes, or for the
washing of cooking and eating utensils,
A number of items, including unsweetened condensed milk,
tomato sauce, tomato concentrate, butter concentrate and jam are
fortified with various vitamins. Other foods, such as vegetable extract,
are added because of their high vitamin content. Hence, if the pack
provides too much food, it is important that portion of each item be
consumed by each service man using the pack, rather than some items
be left untouched. Otherwise, vitamin intake may be insufficient.
With the exception of soap, all items are contained in cans, which
include two rectangular cans for sundry items, four tapered cans for
meat, and the remaining items are in cylindrical cans of the same
diameter but of two different heights. The sizes of the cylindrical cans
are 301 x 411 and 301 x 206, these figures specifying the height and
diameter of a can, the first figure indicating inches and the last two,
sixteenths of an inch. The cans are divided into two lots, each of which
is contained in a fibreboard tray, the individual cans being separated by
means of a fibreboard lattice to prevent rubbing. The two trays are
placed in an outer sleeve and the whole bound with reinforced plastic
tape. The fibreboard of which the trays and outer sleeve is made is a
high wet strength fibreboard. The gross weight of the pack is
approximately 41 lb and its size 10 in x 10 in x 16 in.

TABLE II
CONTENTS OF COMBAT RATION (10-MAN)
Sundry Items; Salt, tea, soluble coffee, curry powder, vegetable extract, two can openers, four
reclosure lids, toilet paper, matches and soap.


In each pack there is a contents sheet and, on the back of this
sheet, there are instructions concerning meal preparation and health
safeguards. These instructions should be memorized by every service
man likely to use the combat ration (10-man) as the ration may have
to be used at night when lights are not permitted, or not available. For
this reason the instructions are reprinted hereunder
COMBAT RATION (10-MAN) INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
General
1. The total pack contains sufficient food for ten men for one day,
five men for two days, or three men for three days. Bread, or biscuits,
(or a proportion of each) is issued separately.
2. The components of the pack are in two trays, each containing
rations for five men for one day. Where operational conditions require
trays of five rations to be issued separately, it will be found that one
tray contains the only can of tomato concentrate and the other the only
can of tomato sauce.
3. The contents of the pack, and the meals for which individual
components are intended, are listed on the other side of this sheet. Jam
is provided in several varieties, which are changed from time to time.
4. The meats, vegetables and puddings are marked with a spot of
identifying colour, viz, RED for breakfast components, WHITE for
lunch and BLUE for tea. This does not mean they cannot be changed
from meal to meal, if so desired.
5. Some items, such as cans with reclosure lids, the intermediate
metal containers and the fibreboard cartons should be retained, if
possible, as they have secondary uses as waterproof containers.
Main Components
6. The main breakfast and dinner components may be consumed hot
or cold, although most components are more appetizing if heated. This
may be done by piercing the top of the can, placing it in water until
three-quarters submerged, and boiling for 20 minutes. The contents
may also be prepared by removal from the cans and heating in a mess tin.
7. The lunch meats may be heated as above, or they may be cut into
thick slices and eaten cold, or fried in a little butter concentrate. If
desired, the fried slices may be coated with milk and crumbed biscuits.


Contents of Combat Ration (One-Man)


Content of Emergency Ration


Curry Powder
8. The curry powder can be added to some meat components to
provide added flavour or it may be used to prepare a special curry dish.
Soups and Stews
9. Vegetable water can be mixed with vegetable extract, tomato
concentrate and, if necessary, a little more water to make soup. By
adding the same ingredients to selected meats and vegetables, a tasty
stew can be made.
Jam Sauce
10. Jam sauce may be made by mixing together equal parts of jam
and boiling water. It may be added to the fruit pudding.
Vegetable Extract
11. The vegetable extract may be used as a spread on bread or biscuits,
and as a flavouring to meat dishes, stews and soups. It may also be
used to make a hot beverage.
Soluble Coffee
12. Water for the preparation of soluble coffee should be hot, but need
not be boiling. When a fire cannot be lit, water may be heated by placing
it in mess tins in the sun.
Butter Concentrate
13. To reconstitute the butter concentrate, remove from the can, beat
to a smooth paste, add an amount of water or milk equivalent to one-
sixth the volume of the concentrate can and continue beating until the
liquid is fully absorbed.
Health Safeguards
14. More cans should not be opened than are necessary for a meal,
and any food that remains in an open meat or condensed milk can, must
be discarded, not kept for another main meal. Cans of tomato sauce or
concentrate, butter concentrate, jam or sugar, should be resealed with
the reclosure lids provided.
In addition to the above elementary instructions on meal
preparation, further variety can be provided by a little ingenuity on the
part of the cook. The following recipes indicate what may be done if
simple cooking equipment is available. The quantities in these recipes
may be increased or decreased, as circumstances dictate, provided the
correct proportion of ingredients is maintained.

TABLE 111
CONTENTS OF COMBAT RATION (ONE-MAN)
Sundry Items: Chocolate, fruit candies, sweetened condensed milk, sugar, tea, soluble coffee,
salt, water sterilizing tablets, matches, spoon-opener, reclosure lid, resealing
band and toilet paper.


Although the main food components differ in each type, all have
approximately the same caloric and nutrient values. As for the combat
ration (10-man), details of the contents of each type may change from
time to time as improved products become available. The contents of
the current pack are given in Table 111.
In addition to the main meal components, it will be seen that each
pack contains the following sundry items chocolate, fruit candies,
sweetened condensed milk, sugar, tea, soluble coffee, salt, water
sterilizing tablets, matches, spoon-opener, reclosure lid, resealing band
and toilet paper.
The biscuits are a different kind to those issued with the combat
ration (10-man), their official designation being Biscuits, ration. The
jam, fruit slice and soup powder are different in each type, but there
is no particular kind of jam, fruit slice or soup powder associated with
type “A”, “B” or “C”. The cheese, or cheese spread, is the same in
each type.
The spoon-opener is for opening the cans and for use as a spoon.
The reclosure lid is provided so that a can of margarine, cheese or jam
can be reclosed if the whole contents are not consumed at one meal.
There is no reclosure lid for the cans containing the main meal
components as it is regarded as unwise to keep the contents of these
cans from one meal until the next, once a can has been opened. The
rubber resealing band can be used to seal the outer polythene container
after the breakfast components, and later lunch, have been removed.
From Table 111 it will be seen that the combat ration (one-man)
contains food for three main meals together with sundry items that can
be consumed between meals. A number of items, including the cereal
block, fruit slice, fruit candies, chocolate, margarine and jam are fortified
with various vitamins. Other items are chosen because they are good
sources of certain vitamins. Hence, to ensure that vitamin intake is
sufficient, it is desirable that all food items in the pack be consumed.
If the pack provides too much food, it is preferable to consume a portion
of each item, rather than leave some items untouched. Soluble coffee
is included to provide variety, and a beverage that can be prepared
when boiling water is not available.
The main component of each meal is packed in a small cylindrical
can, size 211 x 111: the margarine, cheese and jam are packed in
smaller drawn cans. The sweetened condensed milk is packed in two
collapsible metal tubes. Most of the other components are packed in
pouches made from a laminate, consisting of polythene/aluminium

Contents of PIR Patrol Ration (One-man)


foil/kraft paper and are heat sealed. The components for each ration
pack are contained in a polythene bag. Five polythene bags are
contained in a large rectangular tin-plate container and there are two
of these containers to a carton made from high wet strength fibreboard.
When the ration packs are for immediate use within Australia, the
intermediate tin-plate container may be replaced by one or, if the
polythene bags are also dispensed with, five cardboard cartons.
Each ration weighs about 2 lb 11 oz and occupies about 110 cu in.
A carton with two tin-plate containers each holding five rations weighs
approximately 34 lb and measures 9 in x 13i in x 13i in.
When the ration packs are for immediate use within Australia, and
packed in individual cardboard cartons, the gross weight would be
approximately 35 lb.
Within each pack there is a contents sheet and, on the back of this
sheet, a number of important instructions and directions for preparing
certain ration components when heat is available. These instructions,
which are reprinted hereunder, should be memorized by every service
man, who is likely to use the combat ration (one-man), in case he has
to prepare one or more meals in semi-darkness, or even in complete
darkness.
COMBAT RATION (ONE-MAN) INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
General
1. Each pack contains three meals and a number of sundry items.
The jam, fruit slice and soup powder are provided in several varieties.
The commodities intended for each meal are listed on the other side of
this sheet.
2. It is generally desirable that the whole of the food in this pack be
consumed. If the pack contains too much food, it is better to consume
a portion of each commodity rather than leave some untouched.
3. There are a number of pieces of litter in each ration pack, any one
of which may give your position to the enemy. Keep all litter from
foods consumed between meals and, after each meal, bury it with all
other litter.
4. Some items, such as a small can with reclosure lid, the plastic bag
with rubber band, the intermediate tin-plate container and the fibreboard
carton should be retained, if possible, as they have secondary uses as
waterproof containers.


Main Components
5. The main components may be consumed hot or cold, although some
will be much more appetizing if heated. This may be done by piercing
the top of the can, placing it in a mess tin of water so that it is three-
quarters submerged and heating for ten minutes, or by tipping the
contents of the can into a mess tin, or other container, and heating.
Soups/Sauce
6. Soup may be prepared by adding half a pannikin of hot water to
the soup powder and stirring. By using a much smaller quantity of
water, the powder can be used to prepare a savoury sauce or gravy. It
can also be used to flavour a stew.
Soluble Coffee
7. Water for the preparation of soluble coffee should be hot, but need
not be boiling. When a fire cannot be lit, water can sometimes be
heated by placing it in a mess tin and leaving in the sun.
Fruit Candies
8. A pleasant drink may be prepared by crushing one roll of candies
and dissolving them in a pannikin of drinking water.
Condensed Milk
9. After a few months in a tropical climate, the condensed milk may
become brownish in appearance, but it is none the worse for this and
may be consumed without fear of any ill effect.
Chocolate
10. Under some conditions the chocolate may develop a light-coloured
film on the surface. It is none the worse for this and may be consumed
with confidence. A chocolate beverage may be prepared by dissolving
portion of the chocolate in hot water and adding milk and sugar to taste.
The chocolate may also be flaked onto biscuits.
Salt Tablets
11. The salt tablets are for those engaged in strenuous physical activity
under hot conditions and, as a result, are sweating heavily. The tablets
should be taken dissolved in a plentiful quantity of drinking water or
may be crushed and sprinkled on food, though this already contains
sufficient salt for most tastes. DO NOT SWALLOW THE TABLETS
WITHOUT WATER. IF YOU NEED EXTRA SALT YOU NEED
EXTRA WATER.


Spoon-opener
12. The spoon-opener should be cleaned after each meal and sterilized
frequently. To sterilize, thread a piece of string through the hole
provided and suspend the spoon-opener in boiling water for a few
minutes.
Sterilizing Tablets
13. These contain WHITE water sterilizing tablets and BLUE taste-
removing tablets. To sterilize water, place a crushed WHITE tablet
in an empty water bottle and then fill the bottle to the shoulder with
water. Shake the bottle vigorously. Wait 30 minutes and then add the
BLUE tablet and shake again. The water is then fit for use.
EMERGENCY RATION
This is the third combat ration. It consists of two bars of light-
coloured chocolate each weighing 2 oz. Because chocolate has a low
moisture and high fat content, it is a very concentrated food and the
emergency ration provides not less than 500 calories. In addition, it
is vitamin fortified. Although a little harder than commercial milk
chocolate, its palatability is not significantly lower.
The emergency ration is designed to serve two purposes. Firstly,
it is intended as a personal issue for consumption in an emergency,
when a service man is really hungry and there is no other food available.
It will not prevent a man from starving, when he has no other food for
long periods, but it will postpone the onset of hunger pangs and the
growing feeling of emptiness. Secondly, it is intended to supplement
either of the other two combat ration packs, when a service man is
engaged on particularly strenuous physical work and expending more
calories, as a result of this work, than he is receiving from either the
combat ration, 10-man or one-man. That is, the consumption of one
emergency ration per day can increase a man’s calorie consumption by
as much as 500 calories.
The chocolate bars, which are scored so that they can be broken
into eight pieces, may be eaten as such, or used to prepare a beverage,
or scraped onto bread or biscuits as a sandwich filling. The chocolate
has a high melting point and will not appreciably soften if carried on
the person or held at warm temperatures. If stored for long periods
under tropical conditions, it may develop a bloom or pale discoloration
on the surface. It is none the worse for this and may be consumed with
confidence.


It has been claimed that the emergency chocolate is thirst provoking.
Experiments by the Army Food Science Establishment have failed to
confirm or deny this claim. There is no theoretical reason why it should
be so. Foods that are thirst provoking usually have high salt or protein
contents. Emergency chocolate has neither.
The two bars of emergency chocolate are packed in a flat
rectangular tin-plate can. A key is provided for opening the can. The
overall weight is about 6oz and the volume about 9cu in. There are
100 emergency rations in one case, the weight of a case being
approximately 43 lb and the dimensions 14 in x 13 in x 10 in.
The emergency ration has a storage life of two years when held at
tropical temperatures. This means that reserves have to be turned over
within this period. In peacetime, it is this turnover of reserves that
gives most service men the opportunity to become familiar with this
ration. Consequently, every effort is made for the greatest number of
service men to use and become familiar with emergency ration packs as
they become available. All service men should be familiar with the
contents of the instruction sheet, which is included in each pack and
reprinted hereunder.
EMERGENCY RATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1. This ration consists of two bars of light-coloured chocolate. It is
vitamin fortified and has a low water content. It is, therefore, a very
concentrated ration. Under some conditions the chocolate may develop
a bloom, or light-coloured film on the surface. This does not detract
from its nutritive value and it may be consumed with confidence.
2. The ration is issued for the following purposes:—
(a) For consumption by a service man on the combat ration
(10-man) or combat ration (one-man) because of the
strenuous physical work on which he is engaged.
(b) For consumption by a service man who is hungry, has not
eaten for several hours and has no immediate prospect of
receiving food through normal channels.
3. When a man, on a combat ration pack, is engaged in very strenuous
physical work, he may lose weight because the calories expended are
more than the calories consumed as food. The emergency ration can be
used to prevent this. It can be consumed as a “between meal” snack
or used for the preparation of a beverage.


Fresh, Dehydrated and Compressed Dehydrated Meat


Compressed Dehydrated, Dehydrated and Fresh Beans


4, When a man has been without food for several hours, hunger pangs
will become evident and he may find it difficult to concentrate. This
ration can be used to postpone these symptoms. It should be consumed
in two, or more, equal parts either as a solid food or used for the
preparation of a beverage.
5. Under survival conditions, when there is no prospect of food for
several days or more, water is far more important than solid food.
Unless adequate water is available, you should conserve what you have
by drinking none on the first day, and you should not engage in any
activity that will cause you to lose body water in the form of sweat.


CHAPTER 4
SPECIAL RATION PACKS
Although combat ration packs are likely to remain the most widely
used ration packs for many years, there will always be circumstances
under which these packs are not ideal, and which are best served by
special ration packs designed to meet a particular situation.
Situations, for which special ration packs may be required, include
the provision of food for service men going on patrol, for aircrew and
passengers on extended or high altitude flying, for submarine crews and
passengers on extended voyages submerged and for survival episodes on
both land and sea. They may also be required for service men of other
nationalities accustomed to different foods and feeding patterns.
To date, four special ration packs have been developed.
These are
(a) PIR Patrol Ration (one-man).
(b) Light-weight Ration (one-man).
(c) Beverage Pack.
(d) Survival Pack.
Of these ration packs, only the first is at present being issued and its use
is restricted to the Pacific Islands Regiment in the Territories of Papua
and New Guinea, The first two packs are complete, but they differ from
the combat ration (one-man) in that they contain rice, and are much
lighter in weight. Hence, they are intended primarily for patrol work,
but only when water for cooking purposes is readily available. The
second two packs are for use after an emergency.
Each of these packs will be discussed in detail, although it should
be realized that the contents of all, but particularly the second, may be
greatly improved as new processing and packaging procedures are
developed by industry. The light-weight ration (one-man) contains a
number of “instant” foods and, as the demand for these foods increases
on the civilian market, the future development of such foods can be
expected to be considerable.
PIR PATROL RATION (ONE-MAN)
This ration pack was especially designed for the Pacific Islands
Regiment, when on patrol in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea,
and takes into account the ration scale appended to the Native
Employment Ordinance, No 56 of 1958. The pack contains enough


food for one man for one day, acknowledging the fact that, on nearly
all patrols, it is possible to supplement the food in the pack with fresh
foods from native villages. Each PIR patrol group has a small monetary
allowance for this purpose.
The PIR Patrol Ration (one-man) is available in two types
designated “A” and “B”. In each type, the main meal components
differ, but there is no appreciable difference in the caloric or nutrient
contents. Both types provide approximately 3100 calories per day.
To reduce weight, the components in each type are confined to dry or
dehydrated foods, with rice as the basic commodity. The rice is
unpolished and has a much higher nutritive value than the polished or
white rice contained in the light-weight ration (one-man), described
later.
As for the light-weight ration (one-man), heat and water are
required for cooking purposes. When on patrol, it is customary for
Pacific Islanders to cook only one meal per day and this takes place in
the evening when there is most time available. It is, therefore, essential
to have sufficient water for cooking the ration at the end of the day’s
activities. The total quantity of water required is about 2f pints and
this may restrict the use of the ration under conditions of water shortage.
Over the greater part of Papua and New Guinea, however, ample
drinking water is usually available. When water is not available, the
combat ration (one-man) may be found suitable.
There are no cans in the PIR Patrol Ration Pack. All the
components are packed in pouches made from a laminate consisting of
polythene/aluminium foil/kraft paper. The polythene on the inner
surface enables each pouch to be heat sealed. The components for
each pack are contained in a polythene bag, which is also heat sealed.
The gross weight of the pack is 1 lb 14 oz and its volume about 70 cu in.
Ten packs are contained in a large rectangular tin-plate container and
there are two of these intermediate containers in a carton made from
high wet strength fibreboard. The gross weight is about 50 lb.
The PIR Patrol Ration (one-man) has a storage life of
approximately two years under tropical conditions. The components
that are first to show signs of deterioration are the cabbage and carrot
blocks. The cabbage slowly turns brown and the carrot looses its
natural red colour. At first these changes are accompanied by a
hay-like aroma and, in the case of carrot, this may eventually change
to a pronounced “violet” aroma. Cabbage and carrot blocks showing
marked signs of deterioration should not be consumed.
The contents of both types of the PIR Patrol Ration (one-man)
are shown in Table IV.

CONTENTS OF PIR PATROL RATION (ONE-MAN)
Sundry Items: Salt, sugar, tea, matches and a rubber band.
Each PIR Patrol Ration Pack also contains an instruction sheet,
with instructions printed in English on one side and Pidgin on the other.
These instructions are reprinted hereunder
PIR PATROL RATION (ONE-MAN)
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1. This ration contains rice, biscuits, pressed meat, two dried
vegetables, a flavouring substance, dry tea, sugar, salt, matches and a
rubber band.
2. In each pack, there is sufficient food for one day for one man
(white or native) on normal patrol activities.
3. It is produced in two types, shown by the letter “A” or “B” on the
polythene bag containing the pack.
4. In each type the meat and flavouring substance, and sometimes the
vegetables, are quite different.


Contents of Beverage Pack


Survival Rations- Water and Glucose


5. Each pack, whether “A” or “B”, is a complete ration and you could
live on it alone for long periods.
6. However, whenever there is fresh fruit available, it should be used
to supplement the ration.
7. If the ration contains too much food it is better to use portion of
each item rather than leave some untouched.
8. After breakfast or lunch the unused items should be replaced in the
polythene bag, fastening it with the rubber band.
9. Two meals require water for their preparation and this important
fact should not be overlooked.
10. This sheet may be used as toilet paper or for starting a fire.
LIGHT-WEIGHT RATION (ONE-MAN)
The combat ration (one-man) weighs 2 lb 11 oz. If rations for
several days have to be carried as a personal load, the weight at the
beginning of the operation is very considerable. Hence, for such
conditions, it would be an advantage if a lighter weight ration could be
made available, both to reduce the load carried by the user and to
reduce transport requirements in forwarding rations to the point of issue.
The current combat ration (one-man) is a very compact ration
containing no watery or bulky foods and the maximum amount of fat
consistent with palatability. To reduce weight further, and still provide
3500 calories, it would be necessary to produce a pack containing items
with even less water, and this means the inclusion of dehydrated items.
Such foods require heat and water for their preparation and this tends
to restrict their use. Hence, the light-weight ration (one-man), which
consists largely of dry and dehydrated components, can only be used
when heat and water are available at the point of consumption, the total
amount of water needed for cooking being about If pints.
Consequently, it is a special ration and cannot be interchanged with the
combat ration (one-man) under all conditions.
The light-weight ration (one-man) contains sufficient food for one
service man for one day and it is intended for situations in which kitchen
facilities are not available and messing is on an individual basis. It
provides two meals that need preparation and a snack meal for
consumption at midday. Also, there is a snack item for consumption
during the morning and afternoon. When water for cooking purposes
is available, the light-weight ration (one-man) can be used in conjunction

with the combat ration (one-man) to provide additional variety and
thus postpone the effects of monotony which may develop when one-
man ration packs have to be consumed for a week or more. It can also
be used in conjunction with the combat ration (10-man).
The light-weight ration (one-man) comprises two types designated
“A” and “B”. The contents of each type are given in Table V. The
design of the ration is likely to remain fixed although, as mentioned
earlier, details of the contents of any ration pack may vary from time
to time as new and improved products become available. Alternatively,
a third type may be developed to include new foods if sufficient become
available. The kind of jam or jelly is not specified but it would be
different for each type.
TABLE V
CONTENTS OF LIGHT-WEIGHT RATION (ONE-MAN)
Sundry Items: Sugar-coated chocolate discs, instant milk powder, sugar, tea/coffee,
salt, matches, and rubber band.
The rubber band is for placing around the container holding the
ration after it has been opened and part of its contents removed.
From Table V it will be seen that the light-weight ration (one-man)
is a comparatively simple ration requiring a minimum of skill for its
preparation. It provides approximately 3500 calories and a number of
items, such as the jam or jelly and the fillings in the sweet biscuits, are
fortified with various vitamins. Hence, to make sure that vitamin intake
is adequate, it is generally desirable that all the food in the pack be
consumed. If the pack provides too much food, it is better to consume
portion of each item rather than leave some items untouched.


Within each pack there is a contents sheet and, on the back of this
sheet, there are instructions for the preparation of various ration
components. These instructions, reprinted hereunder, should be
memorized by each service man before using the ration, as he may be
required to prepare some meals during darkness.
LIGHT-WEIGHT RATION (ONE-MAN)
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
General
1. In each pack there is sufficient food for one man for one day. The
pack is designed so that it will provide three meals and a snack item.
Its contents are given on the other side this sheet.
2. This ration is a light-weight ration containing several heat processed
(partially cooked) or “instant” foods which only require hot water for
their preparation.
3. The whole of the food in the pack should be eaten if this is possible.
If not, it is better to eat a portion of each item rather than leave some
items untouched.
4. There are at least 20 pieces of potential litter in each ration pack.
Any one of these may give your position to the enemy. Hence, place
wrappings from each meal in your pocket, and burn and bury these and
all other litter at the end of each day.
Breakfast Dish
5. To prepare spaghetti and tomato, empty contents of the outer and
small inner pouch into a mess tin containing about iin of water, and
boil for about 2 minutes. For noodles and mulligatawny, the amount of
water should be slightly increased to about fin in the bottom of a mess
tin.
Rice and Meat
6. Place water in a mess tin to a depth of about im; bring the water
to the boil and then add it to the rice in its pouch after tearing a narrow
strip from the top. Leave for about 15 minutes. In the meantime,
crumble the meat block into another iin of water in a mess tin and boil
for about 10 minutes.
Instant Milk
7. A spoonful of instant milk powder can be added to tea in the same
way as sugar, or it may be reconstituted first by mixing with water.


Curry or Onion Powder
8. The curry or onion powder should be mixed with a little water to
a thin paste before it is added to the meat.
Salt
9. The extra salt is for those engaged in strenuous physical activity
under hot conditions and, as a result, are sweating profusely. It can be
sprinkled on food or taken in a plentiful amount of drinking water.
THE SALT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN WITHOUT WATER. IF
YOU NEED EXTRA SALT, YOU NEED EXTRA WATER.
There are no cans in the light-weight ration pack. All components
are packed in pouches made from a laminate consisting of polythene/
aluminium foil/kraft paper, the polythene on the inner surface allowing
the pouches to be heat sealed. The components for each ration are
packed in a heavy polythene bag which is also heat sealed. The gross
weight is 2 lb, which is 11 oz less than the combat ration (one-man).
Four packs are contained in a large rectangular tin-plate container and
there are two of these intermediate containers in a carton made from high
wet strength fibreboard. The gross weight is about 23 lb and the overall
dimensions 9 in x 13i in x 13i in. With the exception of the
intermediate metal containers, all the packaging material in this pack
can be burnt, leaving only a very small metallic residue. The
intermediate containers have a number of secondary uses as waterproof
containers, and for holding water.
When the light-weight ration (one-man) is produced for immediate
consumption within Australia, the containers holding individual rations
may be packed in fibreboard cartons without an intermediate container.
This reduces packing costs without affecting the quality of the ration.
The light-weight ration (one-man) has a life of two years when
stored under favourable conditions. If the intermediate container is
dispensed with, care is necessary to ensure that the place in which the
rations are stored is free from rodents and termites,
BEVERAGE PACK
Experience has shown that after an emergency, during which lives
have been threatened, and there are casualties, the best means of
relieving shock and restoring morale is by providing a hot strong drink
of a kind to which survivors are accustomed. For most Australian
service men, this would be tea or coffee, although there may be an
occasional man who prefers hot soup or a fruit drink.


Survival Ration- Water and Pudding


Ration Cartons being Used for Shelter


To meet these conditions a beverage pack has been designed and
will be available in two types, “A” with tea, and “B” coffee. Each
type contains sufficient ingredients for 250 x 8 fl oz serves of tea or
coffee, and ingredients for 10 x 8 fl oz serves of fruit drink and
10 x 8 fl oz serves of hot soup. The tea, or coffee, sugar and milk
powder are each contained in a number of small pouches to facilitate
making small quantities of beverage. Details of the contents of the pack
are given in Table VI.

Sundry Items: Five packets of absorbent tissues, and five plastic straws,
cups and spoons.
The absorbent tissues may be used as serviettes, handkerchiefs or
toilet paper. The straws are for men who cannot raise themselves to
drink in the normal way, and the cups for men who are without their
own drinking utensils. The spoons have long handles and can be used
for stirring large quantities of beverage. The tin-plate container can be
used for boiling water if no better means is available.
An instruction sheet lists the contents of the pack, and gives the
number of pouches, containing each ingredient, that should be used for
preparing various quantities of each beverage. It should not be
destroyed but replaced in the tin-plate container as long as the latter
still contains beverage making ingredients. It may be needed by the
next person using the pack.
All items, except the sundries, are contained in laminated pouches,
the tea, or coffee, sugar and milk, each being contained in twenty-five
pouches so that small numbers of men can be catered for without the
risk of losing food, which frequently happens when small quantities are
taken from large packets which cannot be properly reclosed. The
complete pack is contained in an intermediate tin-plate container and
there are two of these containers in a carton made from high wet strength
fibreboard. The gross weight is about 20 lb.
The pack, in which tea and coffee are vacuum packed, has a
storage life of two years under favourable storage conditions.


SURVIVAL PACKS
Disasters at sea, in the air and on land will always occur. In peace-
time, they are not common but, in wartime, they occur with appalling
frequency. When they occur in places where food is not available,
survival rations are needed.
Under survival conditions, water is far more important than solid
food. If a man is deprived of water, so that his intake is not sufficient
to balance his losses, he will at first suffer physical discomfort and,
if the condition continues, eventually die through dehydration.
As water is so very important for survival it might be thought that,
when weight and space are limited, it would be better to provide nothing
but water, rather than reduce the amount of water to include some
solid food. This is not so, for water economy is partly dependent on
the ingestion of solid food, which also assists in improving and
maintaining morale and provides a few calories which enable physical
activity to be undertaken with smaller demands on body reserves.
To meet these conditions, two survival packs have been developed.
They are designated types “A” and “B” and their contents are as
follows:
Type “A” 5 x 1 pt of drinking water,
5 x oz of lightly compressed glucose tablets.
Type “B” 5 x 1 1/3 pt of drinking water,
5 x 1 lb of a special fruit pudding.
Each type is for consumption from the second to the sixth day of
survival. No water or solid food should be consumed on the first day
and little can be gained by extending this ration beyond the sixth day.
Type “A”, which provides about 500 calories per day, is a restricted
ration for use when storage space is very limited. Its gross weight is
about 9 lb. It has excellent storage qualities and can be kept under
tropical conditions for at least two years. The glucose tablets may be
consumed as such or they may be added to the water to give it flavour.
Type “B”, which provides about 1500 calories per day, is a more
acceptable ration than “A”, but requires greater storage space. Its
gross weight is about 16 lb. The pudding, prepared in accordance
with a special specification, closely resembles ordinary canned plum
pudding and has a storage life of at least two years.
The water and pudding are provided in hermetically sealed cans.
The glucose tablets are provided in laminated plastic pouches. It is
possible to provide the pudding in several laminated pouches, in place
of a can, but this form of packaging requires great care to prevent
contamination during the packaging process.

Combat Rations in Use


CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION
The prime purpose of all service ration scales, and ration packs,
is to maintain service personnel in the best possible state of mental and
physical fitness, to the extent that this is possible with food.
Service personnel, adequately nourished and physically fit, perform
physical work with comparative ease. Their endurance is considerable
and they recover with fair rapidity after the completion of a strenuous
task. It should be remembered, however, that a physically fit man or
woman is one who is neither over-weight nor under-weight. It is one
who has attained, and is maintaining, the weight at which he or she looks,
feels and performs best.
It is generally recognized, that the performance of healthy personnel
on an adequate ration, cannot be improved by the consumption of
additional or special foods. Hence, care should be taken not to
consume vitamins in excessive amounts (for instance, by supplementing
an adequate ration with vitamin tablets) as this would not only be of
no value, but, with some vitamins, could be harmful because of their
toxicity in large amounts. Vitamin tablets should only be taken on the
advice of a medical officer.
It is not generally recognized that meal frequency can have an
important bearing on all aspects of human performance, large meals and
long periods between meals being especially undesirable. Inherent in
the term frequency is the size of the meal consumed, more frequent
meals meaning smaller meals. There is no scientific basis for the belief
held by some service men and women that eating between the three
main meals is injurious to health and that the stomach needs intervals
during which to rest. The food consumed between the main meals
should, of course, be nutritious and the overall consumption of food
should not be excessive.
Because drinking water is not normally rationed, it has been given
only passing mention when discussing ration packs. Nevertheless, it
is extremely important. The body’s need for water takes second place
only to its need for air. If too little is drunk, there is loss of water from
body tissue and the body begins to dehydrate. Thirst is not a good
indication of water requirements as there is usually an appreciable lag
between bodily requirements for water and a sensation of thirst.
Because of this, water as such, or in the form of a beverage, should
generally be consumed in excess of the amounts required to quench
thirst. Salty foods should never be consumed unless there is ample
water available. The old ideas about water discipline are no longer valid.


All these factors were given due consideration in the development
of the ration scales and packs described in the preceding chapters. It
is for this reason that service feeding, although traditionally the subject
of adverse comment is, in actual fact, as satisfactory as the authorities
in the Armed Forces know how to make it after giving due consideration
to all the latest scientific knowledge on all aspects of the subject.
