SPEAKER'S CHAIR CEREMONY
CANBERRA A REALITY TO THE PEOPLE
Canberra has, within the span of a week, been brought closer to reality with the
people ot the Commonwealth of Australia, whom it is destined nobly to serve.
Monday, October 11, 1926, will be known as one of the great days of Au&-
tra lan istory. It will he remembered as the day on which a gift of imperial significance
was an e to the Parliament of Australia, as the day on which a distinguished gathering
0 mpire statesmen visited Canberra, as the day when members of the Government and
1 arhament of the Commonwealth gathered at Canberra in numbers previously not
Parliament When the first official gathering took place in the new Houses
, i � e hundreds who witnessed the ceremony, and to the tens of thousands who
ear it y iadio, came as never before, the reality of Canberra, and a message that
Canberra had no longer to be vindicated; it is now by all true Australians to be exalted
and revered.
