A REPORT UPON THE LANDS HELD
BY EVAN EVANS, IN THE KIM-
BERLY DISTRICT OF WESTERN
AUSTRALIA.
Melbourne, 10th March, 1884.
Evan Evans, Esq.,
Melbourne.
In reply to your letter of the 7th instant,
I beg to hand you a Report upon your country in
the Kimberly district of Western Australia.
The country showing on the maps as being held
by you is between 17th degree 30 minutes and
18th degree of south latitude, and the 127 th degree
of east longitudinal runs through the centre of your
property. You are bounded on the north and
north-east by that splendid block of land_ held
by the Cambridge Downs Pastoral Association,
and on the east by the Edith Plains. These Plains
were travelled over by Mr. Alex. Forrest, during his
explorations of that part, and in his journal describes
the country as being richly grassed, and extensive
open plains and downs, with numerous rivers and


creeks running through it. For a further descrip-
tion of these fine properties I refer you to my diary,
p.p. 11 to 15, or to my published report in the
Argus of the 19th and 27th January.
Tour country is exactly similar in its character to
both of these runs, and is splendidly grassed with
such grasses as the Mitchell Bye, Barley, Blue
Dwarf, Kangaroo, Landsborough, and various other
rich and succulent grasses peculiar to Western Aus-
tralia, the soil being rich chocolate and brown loam.
As to its waters, I noticed that the Fitzroy Biver
(which takes its rise on the Cambridge Downs)
runs in two branches through the heart of your
country. I also noticed that the river was joined ?
on either side ?by numerous tributaries to the west,
many of which had running springs of permanent
water. The eastern portion of your block is drained
by the Margaret Biver, which is also a tributary of
the Fitzroy.
I have been for many years a resident of Queens-
land, and can safely say that I Lave never seen better
grassed country than this. It is also rich in herbage.
As regards its waters, there is nothing, either in
Queensland or New South Wales to be compared to
it. Owing to the numerous water-courses running
throughout it at every point, the whole of your
country is made available, without any further outlay
for conserving water.
This country being on the slopes of the King
Leopold Eange is composed of high, open plains and
downs, lightly timbered forest country, with richly-
grassed valleys, between the low and sloping ridges
of sandstone and limestone, which is the geological
formation of that country.


I consider this country to be far superior to the
already stocked country on the Pitzroy Eiver, as
your grasses are much finer and more various than
the grasses there. Your country is also high, dry,
and sound, with little flooded country, while that on
the Fitzroy is annually subject to floods, thereby
subjecting the stock to great danger. lam rather
under-estimating the capabilities of this country than
otherwise when I allow four acres to the sheep all
the year round, or one hundred and twenty-five
thousand to every five hundred thousand acres.
As regards the timber thereon, there is abundance
for all station purposes ?fencing, building^and yard-
making. Among the trees I notice ?G-iant gum,
Bloodwood, Curry John, Mellaleuca,. Bohenia, Leich-
hardt Pine, Swamp Cedar, and many others suitable
for shade.
The climate is very mild during the months of
April to November, the days being sufficiently warm
to be pleasant, while the nights were cold, the ther-
mometer on many occasions showing as low as 32
degrees, thereby causing ice in water-bags and
buckets.
There are but few wild dogs, as during the whole
of the time we were out I only saw five.
I was most careful in examining the country for
the presence of poison plant or injurious grass seeds,
but failed to find either.
In reference to your geographical position you are
most favorably situated, as you are only some 130
miles from the navigable waters of the Cambridge


Gulf, at a point where the Messrs. Durack unshipped
their horses previous to their exploration of that
part of the country. You are also distant only some
180 miles from the ?New Town? at the mouth of
the Eitzroy River, in King?s Sound, and only about
44 miles from the already stocked country at the
junction of the Eitzroy and Margaret Rivers; the
last accounts from there showing that the sheep are
doing remarkably well. It is well known that Cam-
bridge Gulf as a harbor is second to none on the
whole of the north-west coast; it is completely land-
locked, and affords secure anchorage for the largest
vessels afloat, and the open sea outside the Gulf is
free from reefs or coral patches to Port Darwin,
India, China, or the Dutch Settlements. Port Dar-
win from Cambridge Gulf is distant only some 24
hours? steam; Batavia and the Dutch Settlements
only five or six days, and India and China only some
ten or twelve days. These facts combined must
make your property a most valuable one. as it is
not only most suitable for sheep but is also well
adapted for the growth of cattle and horses, and I
would strongly recommend the breeding of the
latter, as a great market must offer for a suitable
class of horses, not only in India and Dutch Settle-
ments, but also in England, where there is a growing
demand for such stock.
I have also during my explorations discovered a
capital stock route from Queensland to ?Western
Australia, and a considerable demand for young
store stock must arise in the Northern Territory for
some years to come.
I may here state that I have seen a letter from
some gentlemen in Sydney, stating that they are


prepared to erect a freezing establishment as soon
as they can get a guarantee of sufficient fat stock to
carry it on.
It is well known that cattle have been landed in
good condition in London from Melbourne, while
this harbor is fourteen days steaming nearer to
London, avoiding the stormy passage round Cape
Leuwin.
I now hold a letter from the Hon. John Forrest,
Surveyor-General, W.A., informing me that a party
of surveyors would start from Perth on the 17th of
the present month for the purpose of surveying the
runs on the Ord Eiver and surrounding country;
they will also lay out a town site at Cambridge Gulf.
He also informed me that a Government steamer
would shortly go round to re-survey the Cambridge
Gulf and mouth of the Ord River, and would then
leave the necessary officers in connection with a
shipping port; he further informed me that as soon
as occasion required his Government would arrange
for a steamer to call into Cambridge Gulf every
three months on its way from King?s Sound to Port
Darwin.
The leases of this country have ten years to run,
and by recent dispatches from Lord Derby, the
Home Government has sanctioned the right of
present leaseholders to receive on application a
renewal of these leases for a further term of 14
? years; thus in all the tenure will be 24 years.
I have proved the natives to be harmless, showing
during my travels more fear than hostility, and can
safely say that they will be of great service to the
future settlers there, as they make capital shepherds


and stockmen, thereby saying European labour. It
is my intention to go and settle there with the first
stock.
In conclusion, I beg to inform you that the Messrs.
Durack, who hold some country there, have now
on the road some 8,000 sheep and 4,000 head of
cattle; and Mr. J. A. Panton, P.M., of Melbourne,
has also on the way 4,000 head of cattle to stock
some country on the Ord Eiver.
Trusting that the above report may prove satisfac-
tory to you,
I am, Sir,
Yours most respectfully,
W. J. O?DONNELL,
Late Leader Kimberly Exploring Party.


Western Australia,
Crown Lands Office,
Perth, Peh. 9th, 1884.
In reply to your letter o� the 28th January,
I have the honor to inform you that it has been
submitted to me for the information of His Excel-
lency the (Governor, and His Excellency has directed
me to inform you that he is very pleased with your
favorable report of the country thr'ough which you
travelled, which was previously unknown.
It is the intention of this Grovexmment to despatch
during this season a survey expedition to extend the
survey of last year from the head of the Eitzroy to
Cambridge (Gulf; and it is also proposed if possible
to make a more exact nautical survey of the entrance
and anchorage of the Ord Liver, and try and select
a position for a port or town.
So soon as circumstances will admit, and it is seen
to be required, a seat of magistracy and centre of
local government, with a police force, will be estab-
lished ; meanwhile the district is open to private
enterprise, and there is nothing to prevent the com-
mencement and progress of squatting operations, and
any shipping trade the district requires.
His Excellency is of opinion that the place at
which the produce of the interior will be shipped


must be determined in the end by tbe natural
features of the country, and not by any rivalry
between the Governments of neighboring colonies.
I thank you, in His Excellency?s name, and in my
own, for your interesting report.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
JOHN EOEEEST,
Commissioner of Crown Lands.
W. J. O?Doknell, Esq.,
Garton?s Hotel, Melbourne, Victoria,
J. J. Millee, Printer, 72 Little Collins-st. E., Melbourne.
