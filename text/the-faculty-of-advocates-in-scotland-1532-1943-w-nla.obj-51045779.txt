PREFATORY NOTE
The office of Advocate may be said to have been instituted by the Act
creating the Court of Session in 1532, Section 64, which enacted " that
there be ane number of advocates and procurators chosen and to be
chosen to the number of ten persons that shall be called general procura-
touris of the Councel.”
Previous to this there were a number of persons known as procurators
or advocates, who pled before the Lords of Council. It is not known by
whom these persons were chosen or if they were nominated by the litigant
on whose behalf they appeared. A list of such persons, whose names
appear in the Register of the Lords of Council, will be found at the end
of this volume.
From among these, the Lords of Council and Session on 7th May 1532
appointed Robert Galbraith, Robert Leslie, Henry Spittell, John Lethem,
Henry Lauder, Thomas Kincraigy, Thomas Marjoribanks and William
Johnston as advocates to plead before them. On 10th November 1537
seven more names were added.
Originally no special qualifications were required for admission and
the Court admitted those they thought fit until 1619, when an Act of
Sederunt was passed introducing an examination and thesis.
The list now printed was first compiled about 1886 when the editor
was engaged on a similar list of Writers to the Signet which afterwards
appeared in the History of that Society. It is founded chiefly on the
Books of Sederunt of the Court of Session, where alone a nearly complete
record is to be found, and the lists of the Faculty printed in
“ Chamberlayne’s Present State of Scotland,” 1707 to 1748, and the
Edinburgh Almanacs, 1739-1932, also a list compiled in 1835 by John
Philp Wood, the peerage writer, recently presented to the Advocates
Library, has also been consulted. The Books of Sederunt are unfortun-
ately awanting from 1555 to 1560, 1567-74 and 1608-26, and there is no
record of admissions for these years, but the names of most of these
have been got from other sources such as the Registers of the Great
Seal, Privy Council, Testaments in the various Commissariats, Edinburgh
Baptism, Marriage and Burial Registers, and Lord Hailes’ List.
The genealogical notes appended to each entry have also been collected
from these sources, the Marriages and Deaths in the Scots Magazine,
1739-1826, the Scotsman, 1817 to date, and from others too numerous to
mention, and represent the researches of nearly sixty years—and for
these the compiler is solely responsible. The Office Bearers of the Faculty
desire it to be made clear that the Faculty Minutes have not been
consulted and that they are not responsible in any way for the complete-
ness or accuracy of the list.


The list for the last forty-five years has formed one of several similar
records kept in the Lyon Office and has been extensively consulted by
members of the public and Government Departments.
The list being chiefly to assist genealogical research does not attempt
to give a biography of each member or all his distinguished services to
the State, such being outside the scope of Scottish Record Society’s
publications. For this reason also no bibliography has been given and
for this reference can be made to the Catalogue of the National, formerly
the Advocates’, Library.
In 1674 a difference occurred between the Court of Session and the
Faculty in a process between the Earl of Dunfermline against the Earl of
Callendar and Lord Almond, an appeal from a judgment of the Lords of
Session in favour of the former to the King and Parliament, a proceeding
uncommon, though not without precedent, was immediately lodged.
The attempt was resented and the Appellant’s Counsel were required
to swear to the advice they had given. Sir George Lockhart and Sir
John Cunningham, Counsel for the Appellant, refusing, to take that
arbitrary oath, were debarred from exercise of their functions, deprived
and banished. Fifty advocates resenting the indignity done to their
order, followed them from the bar and were banished twelve miles from
the capital till they renounced the right of appeal to Parliament. They
were permitted to return after a year’s exile on an evasive acknowledg-
ment that judicial proceedings were not suspended by appeals which,
however, they durst not disown without impugning the supreme authority
of the Estates of Parliament. The dates of their re-admissions are given
under their names.
