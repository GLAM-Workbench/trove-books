Unknown Anzac
AND OTHER
POEMS
By VICTOR KENNEDY.
“ For the sake of past hours.
For the love of old times.
Take a “ basket of flowers,"
And a bundle of rhymes;
Though all the bloom perish
E'er your hand can cherish.
While churlish and bearish.
The verse jingle chimes.”
A. L. Gordon.

A WORD BEFORE HAND.
, ITHERTO, it has been my boast, that I
''iWii should never be prevailed upon to
apologise for anything that 1 had done, or
said, deliberately; but I feel that an apology is due
to my readers for having this little book thrust, as it
were, upon their notice. 1 am aware that it is a
precarious undertaking for a comparatively un-
known writer to publish a book of verse; and in
placing this little book before a generous public, 1 do
so, fully realizing that its faults and imperfections
are many. ! claim no merit for them except
this: "that they are the serious effusions of a
" Would-be " Poet, written for the mere pleasure
of the writing; and now made use of for the first
time, except for the several war verses which
have appeared in the " Bendigo Advertiser.”

"SOME-DAY."
“ Someday ” Ah! God that men could see the all
That lies embodied in a simple word ;
Could see its havoc e’re they would recall,
A word passed lightly, or a deed deferred.
“ Someday” we promise, and forget again,
Which takes but minutes to accomplish now;
And ‘ ‘Someday’ ’ comes, but with an endless train
Of bleak misfortunes on her darkened brow.
We do one thing and pass another by,
And so keep moving from the first ‘ ‘Someday’ ’
When deeds in season done but faithfully,
Would keep the troubles of a life away.
‘ ‘Some other day’ ’ they pledged their kindred vow
To live with each and in each other’s love;
But Ah ! “ Someday ” was one asleep below,
And one bemoaned him of his loss above.
The old man, dying, clings to life’s small flame
And makes his exit with a tranquil mind ;
For ‘ ‘Someday’ ’ served to scratch his earthly name
Beneath his will that now remains unsigned.
To ! we are not our own ; and of himself,
What man is there can say ‘ ‘ I will ’ ’ to-day ?
Our lives go on, despite of power or pelf;
Now throbbing flesh, to-morrow-lifeless clay.
“Before the cock crow thrice’ ’ but Peter swore ;
‘ T will not, Lord, forsake Thee, though I die, ’ ’
But ere the cock crowed thrice without the door,
He thrice denied Him with a bitter lie.
Ah! Friend, if we could bring our thoughts to bear
Upon the vain regrets that often grow
From deeds relinquished to the doubtful care
Of dim futurit}- we may not know.
Perchance the errors of oui: High-born race
Would half diminish in the sight of God
And men be willing to receive His Grace
And bow their humble knees beneath His rod.


L’ENVOY.
See what thou hast to do, and do it thou,
Nor think till “ Someday ” it will safely wait;
Think not that “ Someday ” will atone for now,
Test “Someday” comes, but comes, alas, —
Too Late.
"WHERE MAN IS.”
As I pass at twilight’s hour,
Here where peace and quiet dwell,
From each closing hedge-way flower,
Come idyllic sweet refrains :‘ ‘ All is w r ell !’ ’
Wafted to my listening ear,
Comes the deep tone of a bell
Peace inspiring : as I hear.
Deep within my heart I cry : ‘ ‘ All is well !’ ’
Now a man ! I see ! I fear !
(Why I fear, I should not tell.)
But he comes my heart to sear
With the apprehensive thought: “Is all well?”
"TWO TWILIGHTS."
In the silvery gleam of twilight,
Is the dawn of a newer day ;
And I watch through the waning highlight
Of my youth as it glides away.
In the grey of the twilight gleaming,
Is the dawn of my future years ;
And I stand on the threshold dreaming
As the mists of the new day clears.
I am watching the wild birds flying,
(As I gaze in the calm grey sky ;
In the west where the gleam is dying ;)
And I muse as they pass me by :
Can you speak to me wild swans homing,
Through the mists of a dying day ?
Can you see as you pierce the gloaming ?
Do you know of a world away ?


On the breast of the soft air gliding
Blest and freer than human kind,
Have your breasts no regret in hiding,
For a world you have left behind ?
Ah ! you speak to me —softly chiding;
Or reproving my want of grace
For the Hand that is ever guiding,
In the souls of His self-born race
‘ ‘ For to all is the future hidden ;
And the past may be cleared away :
Where the heart is, the thoughts unbidden,
And the works of the hand will stray.
Keep your heart on the Golden Vision
In the hope of a work to do ;
And the God of a Faultless Mission
Will account it a mark for you.”
LOVE TEARS.
A cold grey light is stealing,
(Sad herald of this dawn)
And from my heart appealing,
A sad, sweet song is drawn.
The rose leaves fall and quiver,
Weighed down by heavens dew ;
Pressed down, and falling ever,
As hove-tears fall for you.
The rose stems sway and glitter.
Bereft of young rose-lives ;
And in my heart a bitter,
And still-born, love revives.
I lost you, love, so early !
Oh live ! Oh live ! for me,
For I must purchase, girlie,
A long lost hour from thee !
**»■»»
The rose’s leaves are failing;
The fresh, green lawn they strew ;
As love-tears unavailing
Fall softly, slow, for you.


TO Mrs. F. and her Daughters on the
former’s recovering from a serious illness.
My God ! I thought to be with Thee
Beside Thy Royal Throne above,”
And in her eyes the light of love
Shone as it shone o’er Calvary.
Beside, the doctor took his seat,
Upon that Holy Sabbath morn ;
As peace-inspiring chimes were borne
Above the silence of the street.
His cheerful face threw back again
The hope and faith in things Divine
That lay beneath each pencill’d line
Upon her face immured in pain.
“You did not think to see me more,”
She whispered as he knelt beside ;
And low he bent his head to hide
The facial look of holy awe.
‘ ‘ Uast eve my thoughts were far away,
Where in His golden glory sat
The ‘ lonely Man of Sorrows, ’ that
It makes me almost sad to stay.
’Tis only love that keeps me here,
(Against, it seems, my own desire,
That when my mind was soaring higher
The love of three sweet girls stole near.)
Ah ! Doctor it was not thy skill
That drew me from the sacred brink,
But Him who gave His life to sink
All sin, upon Golgotha’s Hill.
God gave His Only Son that we
Each through His love may enter in ;
But when I sought the goal to win,
That very love environed me.
Sometimes when in this world I see,
The goodness of Messiah spread,
It fills my longing soul with dread,
That God has nothing more for me.
In life I have my pleasures too
But I shall leave them all behind,
And in my Home above shall find
A life and nature wholly new.


And there at last my girls shall be
Enshrined in glory rightly theirs ;
The just reward of all their cares
And noble sacrifice for me. ’ ’
A PRAYER.
O ! Christ, our Ford whom we adore,
To Thee we turn our hearts in prayer ;
Be with us now and ever-more,
Be with us here and every-where.
On The DEATH of EARL KITCHENER.
Out where the vast, wild ocean’s rolling,
Out there he found his watery grave ;
Out where the sullen waves are tolling
The death knells of our England’s brave.
Fast sped on its way the warning ;
Plunged deep into blackest mourning,
A nation weeps,
For one who sleeps ;
His great soul stilled far ever.
From England’s bulwarks one bolt lost,
On surging waves with comrades toss’d ;
Snatched away from duty’s side.
Gone, oh ! gone to his death.
Gone, oh ! gone has England’s pride.
And even death may never
Part him and his iron will
(That remaining with him still),
From his duty to his State.
Sealed his doom and sealed his fate.
Gone, oh ! gone to his death.
Honor him, honor him
Place him by the side
In the hall of fame
Of the men who diejd
For old England’s name.


Rise and swell the dirges
Where the billow surges
Shout his foemen o’er the sea,
Thou hast now thy Godless wish,
Merciless and adamant.
Now no more he’ll trouble thee ;
Publish wide thy paltry cant,
Barbarous and heathenish.
Softly waft the mournful strain,
O’er his undulating tomb ;
Softly swell the sad refrain,
Oh ! ye bugles of Khartoum.
THE UNKNOWN ANZAC.
I *at last eve, and in the softened light
Of quiet reverie,
I saw it in the darkness of the Night
What was ; and what could be.
Time changes so ; He is the Nation’s Pride;
He is —He was not then;
He was “ a man,” no more, until he died,
And proved his love for Men.
We knew not of his priceless gift of love.
That flared up at the call ;
He and the “ Origin of Rife ” above,
They twain, of all knew all.
His lot was cast, not in the sumptuous height
Of gross, heart-aching ease
(Gazed on —disparaged —by the Sybarite
Grown coarse with vanities).
Yet he was first, that one might live on still,
(Was that one you or I ?)
Who fell and died up on that Rugged Hill
Hence famed Gallipoli.


HER ALL.
The lonely widow dried her eyes,
That shone with pride and bitter grief,
And through her tears and heaving sighs
She bravely smiled in some relief.
I asked her of her gallant sons
(And how her eyes shone then with pride)
Of how they faced the cruel guns,
And loyally they fought—and died.
“ Of sons I have but two,” she said,
‘ ‘ And they be young and passing fair,
The others, numbering four, are dead,
And lie great God alone knows where.”
“ The first, somewhere in savage isles,
Samoa, they told me —they who knew ;
But though it fell, I forced no smiles,
For he, my bravest boy, fell, too.”
“ Another, where his father fell,
With half his gallant regiment;
(Ah ! that I can remember well,
’Twas in the wild Dark Continent).”
“ And Frank, my boy, my youngest child !
(Oh, sir, excuse a mother’s tears).
A bonny boy, sir, w'hen he smiled,
And brave he was beyond his years.”
“ Beneath the sullen waves he lies,
No landmark decks his lonely bed.
And though he sleeps ’neath sunny skies,
No green grass waves above his head.”
“ The last to go was handsome Jim
(They say he fills a hero’s grave) ;
And oh ! my heart will bleed for him.
He was our ‘ black sheep ’ Jim —but brave.”
“ And these, my two, my last, my all,
In France are fighting side by side,
Not slow to heed their country’s call,
They risked their all against the tide.”
“ My neighbours say I’ve done my share,
’Tis true I’ve suffered —God knows best;
But had I other sons to spare,
I’d give them as I gave the rest.”


“ON A LONELY BATTLE FIELD.”
They are praying ! They are praying !
Bosoms heaving with the strain,
Grief appalling : Tears are falling,
Sanctifying where their soldier sons have lain.
They are yearning ! They are yearning !
Spare them mercy where they kneel!
Hearts are aching and are breaking
With the wound that time alone can never heal.
They are praying ! They are praying :
God ! How merciful art Thou ?
Hear the pleading which their bleeding
Human hearts are forcing them to utter now.
"31st of MAY, 1916."
Toll out ye mournful knell
Thy cadence rise and swell
Toll o'er the brave beneath the wave
Of Britain’s mighty realm.
Toll o’er the angry Deep
Where Britain’s heroes sleep
The sleep of those who dared the foes
Of Britain’s mighty realm.
His mother, broke and sad,
Awaits her middy lad ;
But Ah ! in vain, he’s ’neath the main
Of Britain’s mighty realm.
With comrades passed along ;
Oh ! soft ye funeral song;
No mother’s care, but love was there
For Britain’s mighty Realm.
God speed them on their way ’ ’
Is all that we may say
In Glory died their youth and pride
For Britain’s mighty Realm.
* (The Jutland Battle.)


THE KAISER.
Apart from hate, vindictiveness, or spite,
I wish to see him — Him —of Germany,
In that great Final Scene, when Truth and Right
Stand face to face with crime and blasphemy.
“OH! STAR."
Single gem in a dark blue ocean
Guardian angel of evil star !
Trembling there with supressed emotion,
Far away from the ills that are.
Tell me where are the joys of living ;
Show me which is the right or wrong?
Far away where the boys are giving,
Fife, to the swing of a martial song.
Steady tramp ! then a comrade falling ;
Monosyllabic prayers to God ;
Then he lies, for his loved ones calling,
Fifeless clay on a crimson sod.
Heroes swinging along so gaily,
Bravely facing their powerful foes,
Bleeding freely and dying daily
For the honour of home ; and those ;
Brothers, sitting at home, enjoying
Ease and comfort so dearly bought;
Fives of kindred, and friends employing ;
Paying back with a coward’s thought.
Speak ! O Star ; has their manhood slumbered ?
Tell me, must it endure for long ?
Shine again where they die outnumbered ;
Show me which is the right or wrong.
A FRIEND.
He finds, who searches what his fortunes send,
His noblest treasure is a faithful friend.


To a Pine Tree in Canterbury Park.
(In Memory of my School-mates
who have " fallen in the Fight.”)
Once again I watch thee growing,
(I have watched thee oft of yore)
And thy limbs are overflowing,
But with tales not heard before ;
Thou art speaking to me slowly,
With a voice of bygone days ;
Sadly now and melancholy
Calling back those distant ways.
Once thou spok’st to me of pleasure,
Once —before the maze of years,
Robbed the world of half its treasure, —
Bathed the universe in tears ;
And the Devil’s ugly rattle,
Sounding from the Turkish shore,
Called my school-mates forth to battle :
Armed them for a Godless war.
I have often climbed thy branches,
With the boys I used to know ;
Now my face as often blanches,
Thinking of that long ago ;
Of my early comrades sleeping,
Some oeside the Eonesome Pine,
Some in France and Flanders reaping
Culture made beyond the Rhine.
Far away from home they perished,
Fighting bravely hand to hand ;
Thus, the buds, that once were cherished,
Withered in a foreign land.
Fighting for no great ovation ;
Falling fast for Liberty ;
Dying for a ravished nation,
And its 1 ‘ King across the sea. ’ ’
Now are gone the joys that flourished,
In the young Springtime of life,
Ere each petty grief was nourished
Into crime and deadly strife.
Gone are now the joys that bound me
To my school-hood far away ;
And a bitter grief has found me
Mourning here with thee to-day.


Aye ! The tale is one of sadness
Thou revealest now to me,
And no fleeting spark of gladness
Penetrates my memory;
But which mocks me in my sorrow
For those lads who once I knew,
Waiting for the Great To-morrow ;
Sleeping till the Grand Review.
THE “VICTORY SOCIAL." *
“ On with the dance ; let joy be unconfined,
No sleep till morn,” but where the stars
gleam bright,
Above that one sleep of a dreamless kind
That reigns o’er Anzac and its shot-torn height.
Swing partners now ; move freely —quicker there,
Our limbs run freely with Australia’s blood ;
No faces, clouded by an anxious care,
Will watch to-morrow for the ‘Prussian ’ flood.
What holdiyou, there ? An Ace of Hearts ? Well
play
Your only trump, though great the sacrifice ;
Play fast and loose, and throw your heart away,
The boys in Flanders will refund its price.
But what comes whispering in mine ears to-night,
Pike voices wafted on the on the murmuring
wave ?
And what this vision stealing on my sight ? :
The fannied pieture of a Soldier's Grave.
To'Miss MacKenzie. A Sonnet.
I only hope, that I have yet in store,
Some greater favours at the Muse’s hand,
That’l may sing, in accents high, and grand,
The full voiced truths of nature’s hidden lore
Of learning ; and, on wings of fancy, soar
* Held by 'the Anti-Conscriptionists in the
Bendigo Town Hall, 1916.


Through humid bowers of Love, at Truth’s
command ;
Or like a lark above the toiling land
On which it seeks, its wealth of song to pour.
And wherefor this ? Not for myself, I ween ;
Not that I seek to gain, like venal man,
The fickle hand of mammon and of fame ;
But that I might, in some small measure, glean
All that is sweet and best from life’s short span,
To please thee miss my chief and purest aim.
To Miss E. Abbott. A Sonnet. *
I can but frame a simple rhyme to thee
In deep acknowledgement for these thy songs
Which, by that kindness which to thee belongs
Have raised my spirits ; and exalted me,
To Higher laws of sweet felicity,
Felt but by prisoners in sensual thongs ;
Erasing sin ; the sickening world of wrongs,
At war with love and Christ’s Democracy.
Verse is, and will be till the end of time,
The chiefest vehicle of mighty thought,
Wherein the world may learn and rest content
And know by this, my rude and awkward rhyme
That I, who long to see the world re-wrought,
Have found sweet solace in the songs you sent.
A POET LIVES.
The rose looks sweeter in the morning light;
The grass blade greener on the dew-kissed lawn;
The gold bars darting thro’ the East more bright;
More tender sweet, the pink soft flush of dawn.
The birds sing blither, and their joyous strains
Are freely sent into a perfect morn ;
The soul of mankind, bursting slumber’s chains,
Leaps forth to greater life —And love is born.
’ On returning a Book of Poems
by Mr. A. T. Woodward.


The spirit of a vanished Spring remains ;
A Summer sunset floods an Autumn sky ;
Sad Winter’s bareness, and its dripping rains,
Are clothed in beauty and in harmony.
A dew-drop glistens on a lily’s stem,
But in a moment it is snatched away,
And sent into the world, a priceless gem
Of pearly beauty—to an endless day.
The streamlet glitters in the moon’s pale light,
And murmurs ever as its ripples run :
“ Beauty and truth usurp their native right,
And nature’s sympathies at last are one.”
Peace, Rove, and Quiet, reign at last supreme,
Within the selfish heart and soul of Man;
And, widening out, the great aspiring dream
Of young Democracy unfolds her plan.
“ And why?” across the universal seas,
The singing query, strength and comfort gives.
For, borne upon the swift returning breeze,
Eternal whispers come, “ A poet lives.”
The World And The Artist.
I hear, and I hate at the hearing,
The voice of a sensuous crowd ;
For GREED is relentlessly searing,
The hearts of the base and the proud.
For Euxury, Pleasure and Power,
The world had forsaken her course ;
The artist, who rose to the hour,
Stood true to his gift and its Source.
‘ ‘ Or ever your griefs be many
Or ever your loves be few
Think Back in the past are any
Who strove and have suffered for you?”
“What Would'st Thou, Lad ?"
“ What wouldst thou, lad, to brighten thee
A sad song from the sighing sea ?
A priceless gem from out the sky ?
A soft cloud caught in passing by ?
Wide gardens heavy with perfume


Of richest and of rarest bloom ?
A summer sunset’s after glow ?
Of purple hills for ever so ?
Soft music, gently, sweetly playing
To hold thy morbid thoughts from straying. ’ ’
“ Aye, all these would I give amain,
For one brief smile from her again.”
THE AUTHOR'S PRAYER.
O! God relieve
This struggle in my breast ;
Make me believe,
And give my spirit rest ;
No rest I find
Of more than transient worth ;
Naught, that should bind
Me to this cheerless earth.
No hopes or joys,
(But in perspective's haze)
But which annoys.
And tires my longing gaze.
Beset with care,
Ere boyhood’s course is run,
How shall I fare
When manhood’s has begun ?
Relieve my heart
Of longings which are vain ;
Make it my part
To burst oppression’s chain.
I who am blest
With gifts, endowed by Thee,
Yet am oppressed
With harsh adversity ;
Great tho’ it be,
Its teachings I have learnt;
Forced in on me
In lessons that have burnt.
* * * * *
Now let me sing
Down deeper than my breast
Each little thing
Must be —is for —the best.


AN ANSWER
“To Wordsworth's Sonnet “Milton I Thou
should'st be living at this hour."
Why call, O man, immortal and austere !
Back to this prison of iniquity,
The bard who sleeps, whose giant soul is free
From stress or cares of this our noisy sphere ?
Great Prophet stay, Thou art not needed here ;
Thou taught’st us once, we need no more of thee;
Thine age’s sons, and sons of years to be
Have heard thy message and must needs revere.
What more should man of brother man desire
Than that, which, emanating from his heart,
Leads men to justice, love and brotherhood ?
Oh, Milton, minstrel of a sacred lyre,
We have, embodied in thy gentle art,
All that is good in thee, and teaching good.
FOR MEN.
Beneath the cruel crow r n, which sanctifies
The awful symbol of a love Divine,
The mortal head, to God’s exacting shrine,
Bows low, as the immortal spirit hies
To God ; His Father, and His Lord. The eyes
Half glazed with anguish of the flesh ; ashine
With love and faith: our pledge, our sacred sign
Of life eternal, and that hope which lies
Within the bosom of our God. Yet He
The Sainted Nazarene, in mortal woe,
(As from His wounds, the last drops ooze and fall.)
“ Oh ! why, My God, hast thou forsaken Me ?”
Exclaims again ; and to the world below
The answer comes-“ For men. This is not all.”
TO A DRIED ROSEBUD.
(Between the Leaves pf Shakespeare)
Mate of my heart thou art calling, and singing to
me of the past;
Singing to me of another, who perished with thee
in the blast;


Ikying where gently I placed thee, between the
great pages of thought
Thou art the all I have left me, with tenderest
memories fraught.
Dead ? Thou art dead to the rabble, who knoweth
thee not in thy worth
Living to me in thy splendour, thou withered and
dried at thy birth,
Years may be dead with their fleeting, but
memories linger behind ;
Thus thou art speaking with voices, of memory
cruel and kind.
Kind, to be luring me back, where my happiness
seems to be cast;
Cruel, because it is futile, my longing to live with
the past ;
Still I must harken in silence to what thou art
telling me now,
Then I must haste to the future, and let the past
pardon her vow.
Should I regret had I left thee ; then in thy
beauty and truth
Nestling between her breasts heaving, and
swelling with rapturous youth ?
Can I cast blame to her, knowing, the words she
would gladly recall ?
Young as she was, and as I was, I would it were
never at all.
Why should I ramble and rave ? It is over and
passing away ;
Only a heart-burning sweetness ; the dream of a
vanishing day.
Aye, they would tell me ’twere nothing:--the
flare of a heart that is young,
Dying away in the stillness like notes of a song
that is sung.
But if it should pass away ? Am I sure I could
wish it were so,
While I have hope for a union the future may
please to bestow ?
Aye, were it better to linger, or vanish and leave
me at rest ?
God, in His Heaven, is wiser, and worketh all
things for the best.


A SMILE.
Laugh if you can, be happy while you may,
A genuine smile is as the dawn of day ;
Or sent from Heaven ’tis a gentle ray,
To guide each pilgrim on the narrow way.
TO SLEEP. (Written in Bed).
Now come, Oh Sleep, and weave thy gentle charms
Around my head and lull me in thine arms
Away from here to where Oblivion’s streams
Flow gently singing thro’ the Land of Dreams
Aye, far away to where I may forget
This world’s distress, its hopes and vain regret ;
Far, far away where I may rest and live,
Unmoved by pleasures that the world can give.
Here none are freed from Sorrow’s cares and pains
Unknown —Unheard of where the Dream King
reigns.
Oh ! Sleep, enfold me, give me grace awhile,
To bask at leisure in thy dream-soft smile;
Mine eyes grow heavy and their brightness hid,
To feel thy dewy touch upon each lid ;
My senses reel to taste thine incense sweet.
And la}'- their gifts before thine altar’s feet;
Their strength, their power, and their all resign,
To live with thee, within thy realms divine ;
To taste felicity and sweetness rare,
IF' breathing ever thine ambrosial air.
I think I see me in thy land of fays,
Where days are nights and nights are ever days;
Where cypress grows not, and the myrtle thrives
And deathless roses grace the elfin lives ;
Where young Aurora gilds the sparkling lawns
With glistening dewdrops of perennial dawns.
Oh! Sleep, enfold me, give me grace awhile
To bask at leisure in thy dream-soft smile.


REMEMBRANCE *
Soft the strains of organs playing
Quivering through the lofty hall
Hearts of passion, gently swaying
Orpheus reigning lord of all.
List ye now the battle rages ;
Now love’s airy melody ;
Now the veil of fleeting ages,
Drawn by chords of memory.
Hark ! “ Remembrance,” soft and low,
Claiming now my servile will,
Which to scenes of long ago,
Drifting back, and drifting still.
Nimble fingers force upon me
Joys again that I have known ;
And her sweet face smiling on me,
Through these twenty summers flown.
Still the pretty, graceful girl
Whom my flattered fancies know,
With my heart’s impassioned whirl,
Drifting back to long ago.
* * * * *
Stay those fingers recreating
That which I would fain forget !
But the music unabating,
Flows on, flows on, crueller yet.
See young Autumn’s bright-eyed daughters,
As I knew them in their youth,
Re-emerge from Lethe’s waters,
In their beauty and their truth.
But they fade, and still she lingers,
Smiling on me as of yore.
From the keyboard ; now those fingers
Touch the chords that play no more.
Hush ! the music sympathising,
Smooth the rythmic numbers roll,
Till those mournful strains arising,
Jars the iron in my soul.
* A Piece of Music by Carl Rebcr.


With that sad pathetic sobbing
Cleaving through my tortured brain,
And my heart’s responsive throbbing,
Hives that far-off night again.
THE POET TO THE THRUSH.
I heard you singing a song divine,
And prayed you never should cease,
For in this passionate heart of mine
There crept a perfected peace.
You came, and suddenly ceased again,
You sang for love of a song ;
And in my spirit a saddened pain,
Was left, as you fluttered along.
You sang a measure of rare delights ;
A song that vanishes by ;
But I will sing on this night of nights
A song that never will die.
THE THINGS MORE EXCELLENT.
I am at the gate to-night
Of the way that Jesus went,
Far away from creed or rite,
With the things more excellent,
listening to His deathless voice
In the servant He has sent,
Hiving that we may rejoice,
In the things more excellent.
Preaching words divinely wrought;
Willing to be freely spent,
By the Hord who lived and sought
For the things more excellent.
Tribulation, sacrifice,
Humble knees for ever bent,
This the great unchanging price
Of the things more excellent.
To my Ford, my All, I pray
For my heart’s sublime content,
In the truth that lights the way
To the things more excellent.


CREEDS.
The beggar lurks with downcast eye,
And cadges from each passer by ;
We do it in the name of Jesus,
And care not if a million sees us.”
IN LIFE’S MIRROR.
She hurries by,
Singing a song ;
Common her cry,
Rolling along:
“ What is this myth
Rove, that is called,
Consorting with
Spirits enthralled ?
Give me of gold ;
Joy while I may,
Pleasures untold.”
While it is day.”

Cynically wise,
He saunters past,
Scorning the prize,
Rove, to the last.
“ Rips coral red ;
Eyes I adore;
These I would wed,
What is there more ?
Give me of these
While it is day ;
Then as you please
Rove while you may.”

Both have their day
Transient and bright;
But hark! and say :
What of the Night ?


TO F. R.
You creep in my life like a bright sun ray,
Dear little Christian girl ;
Like Moabite Ruth of a latter day,
You tread in the ‘ ‘ Light, ’ ’ and I hear you say ;
“ This path is the Truth, and the only way,
And whither it leadeth I set my face.”
You creep in my life like the bright sunshine
Dear little Christian girl !
For how could it be that a smile like thine,
Belong to a maid who is less divine ;
Who never has paid at the sacred shrine,
The only acceptable price for grace ?
You creep in my life like a bright sun-beam,
Dear little Christian girl!
And down in my heart is a secret dream ;
That, should I be crossing the crystal stream
That flows from the Throne of the Great Supreme,
Our Spirits shall blend, and the kingdom of rest
Will seal it; The end of our passionate quest.
TO THE GIRL AT THE PIANO.
(Miss Ruby Kennedy)
I feel constrained to envy thee,
’Twere sweet to be as thou ;
In touch with immortality,
As thou art now.
With lightsome touch thou strikest deep
Into the light of ages ;
And genius perforce must keep,
Unsealed its pages.
Beethoven’s secret, Mozart’s thought,
Have found response in thee ;
Thy sweet expression, lightly fraught
With grace, in me.
I, too, have passions deep and warm,
That I would fain express,
In music’s sweet alluring charm,
And happiness.


But I must rest content to turn
My passioned heart to thee ;
And there I find what I would learn :
Felicity.
PERSPECTIVE.
(With apologies to Milton.)
When I considered how my days were spent
In vainly stemming the advancing tide
Of vexing problems, that would not subside
And leave me master; though with shoulders bent
And brows contracted ; but with heart intent
On yielding homage at the Muse’s side :
“ The Gods do not exaCt such toil,” I sighed,
And fondly thought; but (powerless to prevent
My murmur) sense replies ; ‘ ‘ Art doth not heed
The groans or sighs of worshippers, who wrest
Her mysteries, they serve her most; her gate
Is open : thousands at her portals plead,
And haste to enter at her mild request;
He only serves her, who will strive with fate.”
THE CHRISTIAN PREACHER.
One there is can satisfy us,
In this world of paltry strife ;
In this world where sin is nigh us,
Blasting hopes of greater life.
Twenty years had passed above me
In my headlong rush for fame,
And I thought that none could love me
Till the voice of Jesus came.
Speaking soft and gently to me,
Asking to be taken in ;
And with pleasure quivering thro’ me,
Purged my heart of native sin.


And He stayed my futile sighing,
For that life which ne’er could be ;
“ Would’st thou love and live undying?
Take thy cross and follow me.”
So I took on board the Pilot:
Him who gave His counsel free.
Joys and pleasures now are my lot,
And my heart ne’er troubles me.
Jesus leads by ways eternal
To the life of countless years ;
Not by pathways rich and vernal,
But by lanes beset with fears.
Rough may be the smoothest clearing,
But it leads me to salvation ;
“ Go ye onward meekly bearing,
Hatred, exile, tribulation.”
Thus I flung off worldly pleasures ;
Left my home and friends, to don
Garments rich with Christ-like treasures;
Took my cross and followed on.
Base vituperation meets me,
Knows my head no pillowing,
But a gentle voice still greets me,
Two maimed hands are beckoning.
"FAITH."
No gold, no worldly wealth,
No mansion high and grand,
Not even blest with perfedi health,
Before Thee, God, I stand.
I leave the world behind.
But grant me this, O Lord,
The willing grace and peace of mind
To know Thee in Thy Word.


Grant me the power to serve
My brothers here below :
And weed from out each passioned verve
The tares of self that grow.
And when bespoke by men,
What joys my fate befall;
Oh ! grant me power to answer then
“ My faith —my Christ —is all.”
THE SONGS OF THE POETS.
As a babe, I descended from regions of light,
Uncorrupted within,
And beheld in my impotence beauty and might
In the shackles of sin.
And a poet was patiently singing a song,
Unregarded the while,
For the voice if his lyre was lost to the throng
Whom he sought to beguile.
Whom he sought to beguile with his visions of love,
From the squalor and strife
Of their sordid enjoyments, to truths far above,
And the glories of life.
And he perished, bequeathing the fruits of his prime
To a world that reviled,
With a love unexampled through ages of time,
Since the Holy Exiled.
And they sought for his songs, that were scattered
On the wind and the wave, [abroad
And at last saw, (but heedless), the glorious road
That he laboured to pave.
But another arose, with a pitiless rhyme,
And a song of his own :
“ What the world is to be with its hideous crime,
And its vice overthrown :
“ For the life that we lead, is a whirlpool of sin,
That the may eschew,
Who in earnest desire to escape from the din,
And confusion in view,


And the truth, from its setting of purity wrung,
In the vortex is whirled ;
While a blasphemous lie, from the pulpit, is flung
At a credulous world.
And the Lord of the Earth, when He comes lor His
Will have few in His fold [own,
For His people have parted and turned from His
To the Image of Gold.” [throne,
THE CLOCK.
Thy long lean hand again has sped
Around thy cold relentless face ;
And from my empty life has fled
Another hour of ill-used grace.
How rarely, when in absent years
I counted each familiar chime,
Thy solemn ticking in my ears
Resounded like the knell of Time.
As now it often sounds to me:
“ Each tick has led thee nearer Home ;
The wings of Time encircle thee,
And whispers still ‘ An end must come !”
“ The end must come,” the solemn cry
Is ticking on with sullen drone
And fills me with a fear lest I
Should pass into my rest —Unknown.
