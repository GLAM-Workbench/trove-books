SIDE ELEVATIONS OF MT. COOK GROUP OF NATIONAL BUILDINGS, SHOWING POSITION
OF NATIONAL WAR MEMORIAL TOWER WITH HALL OF MEMORIES AT FOOT.
[N.B. —The Hall of Memories has been temporarily cut out.]


National Group of Buildings
THE Dedication of the National War Memorial 1 ower and Wellington War
Memorial Carillon on "Anzac Day," 25th April, 1932, will be a notable event in
both national and civic history—firstly as paying a permanent and fitting tribute to
the 1 7,000 New Zealanders who gave their lives for King and Country and the sacred
cause for which the Empire fought in the Great War, and secondly as marking the accom-
plishment of the first stage m the erection of the national group of buildings on the Mt. Cook
site —the National War Memorial, the National Art Gallery, and the Dominion Museum.
1 he terminal of a low spur running out into the heart of Wellington from the semi-circle of
high hills which surround it, and facing the magnificent harbour, the Mount Cook site
dominates the city, and, viewed from the hills or harbour, stands out as a central elevated
point in a huge half-basin overlooking 1 e Aro flat, and possessing a beauty all its own.
Ihe site occupies 9\ acres. For the past 45 years the site has been occupied by the
Mount Cook Barracks, a huge red brick building which was originally intended to be
used as a gaol, but which became Headquarters of the Defence Department and was
utilised as such until last year when it was demolished to make room for the new buildings.
1 he most prominent landmark m the city for so many years, the Mount Cook Barracks
have now given place to a more notable feature still, the noble War Memorial Tower,
which, commencing at an elevation of 87 feet, rises in a stately pile of 166 feet, thus
reaching a total height of 253 feet above mean sea level—far above the height of even
the tallest buildings in the city which are erected on the flat.
1 he adoption of the combined Mount Cook scheme was brought about, primarily,
by the action of the Wellington War Memorial Carillon Society in getting the Govern-
ment in 1926 to agree to grant £15,000 towards the erection of the National War
Memorial d ower on the Mount Cook site to house the bells, and then in inducing the
other bodies interested to agree on the Mount Cook site for the erection of the National
Art Gallery and the Dominion Museum, thus enabling them to take advantage of a
previous offer by the Massey Government to provide £lOO,OOO for the erection of these
two buildings, provided the citizens of Wellington, who had already offered considerable
amounts, contributed a like sum. Ihe conditions for the combined scheme were finalised
in 1928 by Mr. G. A. Troup, C.M.G., then Mayor of Wellington, an Act was passed
by the Parliament establishing the Board of I rustees, and Mr. 1 roup immediately
launched a campaign for the raising of £lOO,OOO by the citizens of Wellington. This
campaign was vigorously conducted, and the total subscribed by May, 1931, was
£85,2 1 7 with various outstanding amounts still to come in. Competitive designs were
duly called for, the competition being won by Messrs. Gummer and Ford, of Auckland.
It was decided to proceed immediately with the erection of the National War
Memorial as the first portion of the scheme, cutting out the Hall of Memories at the rear
of the tower temporarily, and leaving the other buildings till later. The amount of
£15,000 provided by the Government, however, was for a skeleton tower only, and to
complete it with a facing of New Zealand stone the Board of 1 rustees agreed to advance
the additional amount required on the understanding that the Carillon Society would, with
the asisstance of the Board of Trustees, endeavour to raise this sum at some more suitable
date. Contracts were then let to Messrs. Graham & Sons, of Christchurch, for the
erection of the National War Memorial Tower at a price of £17,100, and for the
construction of the stairways and approaches at a cost of £4OOO.
Ihe foundation stone of the National War Memorial Tower was laid on 15th
May, 1931, by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. G. W. Forbes, P.C.


Wellinqton War Memorial Carillon
K 1 main ideas governing the gift and installation of the Wellington War Memorial
Carillon are that it shall be regarded essentially as a memorial to the New
Zealanders who gave their lives in the Great War, that it shall commemorate
their deeds by the giving of special recitals on the anniversaries of the principal engage-
ments in which they fell, and, the carillon being the greatest instrument in existence for
the cultivation of the folk-song and national and religious airs, it shall help to rekindle
among New Zealanders the love of old England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales and of
their own land, and the ideals for which so many New Zealanders died—the triumph of
right over wrong, and the establishment of peace and goodwill amongst men.
These were the purposes which inspired the formation of the Wellington War
Memorial Carillon Society in 1925, and that they met with the wholehearted approval
of the people of Wellington was amply proved in May, 1926, when the Society invited
the donation of individual bells, and received no less than 77 applications within one
week. It was the most successful appeal ever made in the history of the city. Ihe first
installation being restricted to 49 bells, with provision in the apparatus for extension to
53, the Society was confronted with the difficulty of making the necessary allocations,
but this was easily overcome by the goodwill and generosity of the donors, and was met
by conceding all next-of-kin claims and applications by N.Z.E.F. units, and by merging
other interests in bigger bells than they had individually applied for. In all, 33 bells
were allotted to next-of-kin, all being in respect of men killed in action, died of
wounds or disease, and in this connection it is worthy of note that one bell was donated
in memory of three sons, one of three brothers, three in each case of two sons, two in
each case of two brothers and one of two sons-in-law. Six bells, representing Battle
Honours," the last tribute to fallen comrades, were allocated to N.Z.E.F. units, and all
are in a group thus preserving the tradition of common service in the field. Ihe
"Bourdon" bell went to the men of Wellington City and suburbs who "Went West,'
and other large bells to the New Zealand Division, the Anzacs, the N.Z. IVlounted
Rifles, and to the Royal Navy and the British Mercantile Marine.
The tender for the supply of the carillon was let in July, 1927, to Messrs. Gillett
and Johnston, Ltd., of Croydon, England, at a price of £10,512, plus £l5O for the
inscriptions. This was for a weightier set of bells than originally intended, and involved
an extra cost of £Bl2, which was promptly met by the donors providing the additional
amount required.
The first recital was given at the Croydon Bell Foundry on April 10, 1929, and,
pending the erection of the National War Memorial Tower in Wellington to house the
bells, the carillon was loaned to the Newcastle-on-Tyne Exhibition, and to the authorities
of Hyde Park, London, where in 1929 and 1930 it delighted hundreds of thousands
of listeners and became the most famous and popular carillon in the British Isles.
On application being made, the Society also agreed to loan the bells to the British
Exhibition at Buenos Aires in 1931, but the proposal fell through on the ground of
the expense involved.
The two biggest bells arrived here in June, 1929, and the balance in January,
1931, and since then have been stored in the old electric power house in Mercer Street
awaiting erection in their permanent home.
Now these bells of remembrance are to fulfil their mission, singing the songs of the
old land and the new, and giving their message of hope for the years to come.

Dedication Ode
(B\) Johannes C. Andersen)
of the bells and what they commemorate, a vision of the past must take shape in the
t ought the inevitable question following: Are those who quietly flit as shadows never to be seen again?"
The Bells themselves answer; for do not they now represent the ones thought of?—and have they
not been named after the very places where life was given up by those still longed for?
The Human Voices are the voices of those who have not directly suffered such losses as the
Mourners, and take on the part of comforters as much as they may. But the Bells themselves are the
true comforters, even though their voices are less emotional than the Human Voices, as fitting those who
are beyond strife, and terror, and anguish, though they endured all these for the cause they held to be
just, as did, too, the participators with them who returned and are with us still.
All the names of bells it was found, possible to use have been used, as these names now have deep
and enduring associations, each one in a word or a phrase eloquently telling a whole romance of gallant
endeavour and sacrifice, so that their sound, rich in memories, is transmuted and transfigured in the
thoughts of the listeners.
The lyric is intended as one for the Memorial Campanile, and for New Zealand's adopted Day
of All Souls, which is Anzac Day.]

Sister of Ottawa Carillon
r | Wellington Carillon ranks among the world's best. It is built in two frames,
the upper complete with 47 bells, and the lower with the two biggest bells only,
leaving four additional and larger bells yet to be installed. The clavier chamber
on the fifth floor is between the upper and lower bell frames, the latter commencing 66
feet up in the tower, level with the first balcony. When extended to its full range the
Wellington Carillon will be a full sister of the Ottawa Carillon, the weightiest in
existence for its range of 53 bells, being heavier, bell for bell, than the previous carillon
of 53 bells cast by the same firm for New York. Ihe weight of the 49 bells in the
Wellington Carillon is 31 tons 10 cwt. 2 qrs. 4 lbs., as compared with 27 tons 5 cwt.
1 qr. in the carillon at Sydney and first contemplated for Wellington—a difference in
actual bell metal of 4 tons 5 cwt. 1 qr. 41bs. The clappers for these 49 bells weigh
3 tons 7 cwt. 24.25 lbs., the steel frames 26 tons 5 cwt., and the connections 1 ton
more. The total weight of this first installation is thus over 63 tons. When the four
additional bells with clappers are added the total weight will be increased to over 94
tons, the bells alone weighing 62 tons 8 cwt. 2 qrs. 4 lbs.—22 tons 9 cwt. 2 qrs.
1 1 lbs. in the upper frame and 39 tons 18 cwt. 3 qrs. 21 lbs. in the lower frame.
The bells in the New York Carillon, it should be added, have lately been increased
to 58, the largest weighing 18-4- tons.

LOWER BELL FRAME.-—Showing the two big bells with spaces left for 4 more. The
upper bell is "Reo Wairua" (meaning "Spirit Voice"), and the lower one "The Somme."


How the Carillon is Played
Wellington Carillon is equipped with the very latest mechanism for playing, no
less than three methods being provided. These are:—
(1 ) Ihe hand clavier, or console, which is played by the carillonist.
(2) A paper band playing machine, as for a pianola piano.
(3) An ivory key-board with the same touch as an organ.
1 he picture appearing on page 1 1 shows the 47 bells in the upper bell frame, and,
left to right—(l) the ivory key-board, (2) starting clock, (3) hand clavier, and (4)
the paper-band playing machine.
HAND CLAVIER.— 1 his operating the inner clappers is fitted with 61 manuals
and 25 foot pedals, only 49 of these being required to play the existing installation of 49
bells. Ihe object of the provision of the additional manuals and pedals is to enable the
four additional and larger bells to be added at a later date, and also additional bells in
the treble register, if so desired, without necessitating the heavy expense involved in order-
ing a new hand clavier. Ihe pedals for the heaviest bells are arranged radially with
concave tops.
AU 1 OMA 1 IC PLAYING MECHANISM.—As compared with the old drum
for automatic playing of the Carillon, perfected electro-pneumatic playing mechanism, as
illustrated on page 16, has been supplied. This comprises: (a) A small self-contained
4 b.h.p. motor wound to suit the local electrical supply, a large capacity dynamo gener-
ating direct current at 25 volts, an air compressor working at 25 lbs. per sq. in., and a
remote control unit for starting and stopping, (b) Pistons and cylinders actuated by the
compressed air at 25 lbs. per sq. in. for the actual operation of the outer clappers striking
the bells. For the smaller bells they are direct in operation, while for the heavier bells
two large diameter pistons giving full, rapid blows with the heaviest clappers, have been
provided leaving four more to be installed at a later date. Ihe pistons can be operated
in two ways (as in c and d following). (c) Standard ivory key-board, which has
the same touch as an organ, and ensures that the bells can be played by any pianist or
organist apart from the services of a highly skilled carillonist. (d) Standard paper-band
playing machine m which an endless perforated paper-band is used to control the pistons.
It is operated by a small motor, and is entirely automatic, being controlled and started up
at predeteimined times by the insertion of a pm or pins in the circumference of the 24-
hour wheel of the 8-day clock with which it is connected.
PRAC I ICE CLAVIER. In order to enable the carillonist to practise, a practice
clavier, identical in design with the hand clavier on which recitals will be given and
adjusted to the same touch, has been installed in the sound-proof clavier chamber on the
fifth floor of the Campanile. The practice clavier does not operate on the bells with
which it is not connected, but on special musical bars and resonators corresponding exactly
with the actual notes of the bells. The carillonist is thus enabled to practise and to give
lessons, as it were, on the actual bells without in any way using them and so giving annoy-
ance by too much repetition, unfinished and too frequent performances.


Naming the Bells
r I whole of the bells in the Wellington War Memorial Carillon have been named,
and bear their names and inscriptions on them. This is in accordance with the
well-established tradition m England and Europe, where the greater bells are com-
monly called by name, and many citizens can even tell their individual notes. The object
has been to impart a personality to each bell, and the hope is expressed, therefore, that
when the Grand Carillon rings forth, each bell will so become affectionately known in
the minds and hearts of the people.
Ihe Bourdon bell of the first instalment of 49 bells, which has been given m
memory of the 1 700 men of Wellington City and suburbs who gave their lives in the Great
War, has been appropriately named "Reo Wairua," meaning "Spirit Voice," and under-
neath the dedication lines bears the words "Ana! He Tangi Aroha," which translated
means "Hark! A Cry of Love." 1 his serves as an introduction to the whole Carillon,
and is regarded as singularly fitting for such a fine set of War Memorial bells. This bell
weighs 4 tons 19 cwt. 1 qr. 13 lbs., and in accordance with the tradition of all
"Bourdon" bells is specially decorated, carrying a frieze of fern leaves and flax as New
Zealand national emblems upon its shoulder.
Ihe next three great bells, of 4 tons 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 8 lbs., 3 tons 8 cwt. 3 qrs.
4 lbs., and 2 tons 19 cwt. 18 lbs. respectively, represent the three mam theatres in which
the New Zealand Expeditionary Force fought during the Great War, and are dedicated
to the New Zealand Division, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and the
New Zealand Mounted Rifles, in that order. They have been named "The Somme,"
"Anzac," and "Palestine," and carry appropriate inscriptions, including quotations from
the commanders under whom the respective units of the N.Z.E.F. served. The fifth bell,
weighing 2 tons 8 cwt. 20 lbs., an individual memorial, is named "Passchendaele." The
sixth bell, of 2 tons 18 lbs. bears the arms of the Royal Navy, and is named "Jutland";
the seventh bell, 1 ton 13 cwt. 2 qrs. 14 lbs., is called "The Seven Seas," and is
dedicated to the memory of the British Mercantile Marine.
1 he balance include the Civil Service bell, two district bells, six N.Z.E.F. unit
bells, and 32 next-of-kin bells. dhe great bulk of these next-of-kin bells have been
named after the engagement or nearest town or place where the soldiers to whom they are
dedicated fell. Ihe name "Mahara" on one of these bells means "Remembrance," and
"Rongomai,' which appears on another, signifies "Sounding This Way."
I he work of naming the bells and drawing up the list of inscriptions was carried
out by a sub-committee, comprising Mr. E. E. Muir (chairman), Lieutenant-Colonel T.
W. M'Donald, Messrs. G. N. Sturtevant, Johannes Andersen, A. R. Atkinson, L. S.
Fanning, and Professor Gould. In the name and inscription placed on No. 2 bell ("The
Somme") they were assisted by Major-General Sir A. H. Russell, who commanded the
New Zealand Division, and similarly regarding the "Palestine" bell by Colonel C. G.
Powles, late Commandant Central Command, who served throughout the Gallipoli and
Sinai-Palestine campaigns.

The Birth of the Bells
(By Nellie M. Scanlan.)
London, December 21, 1927.
| T was dusk and snowing gently, just a few days before Christmas, when I received a
telegram from Messrs. Gillett and Johnston, the bell founders at Croydon: Casting
first batch of Wellington bells to-morrow. Can you come down?" I went.
England was in the grip of the severest winter for over a decade. It had been
freezing continuously day and night for over six days—freezing and snowing and it
promised an old-time Dickens Christmas. Ihe sun was sinking, a dull red ball behind
the murky clouds, as the train slid into Croydon, where the finest bells in the world to-day
are manufactured. Wellington's sturdy fight to have a memorial carillon ringing out
across the harbour and the hills was this day crowned with triumph. As the molten
bell-metal in the great cauldron was swung high to be poured into the prepared moulds,
Mr. Cyril Johnston himself directed the work. Wouldn t you like to put sixpence into
the mould, to be melted into the first Wellington bell? he asked. I scrambled among
coppers and half-crowns. I hadn't got a sixpence, but I soon borrowed one, and tossed
it into the mould, where the stream of glowing metal, like a river of flame, swept it along
in its tide. This was the first bell of the Wellington Memorial Carillon, Bell No. 38,
"Sari Bair," which bears its inscription.
The big foundry stood back from Whitehorse Road, and like any other foundry, it
was full of lathes and machinery. From the swiftly descending dusk and icy air we had
stepped into the gloom, where charcoal braziers glowed among the great bells, giving out
a warmth sufficient to enable the men to work upon the metal. Bells of every size and at
every stage were spread about.
"We had already cast a number of bells for the Wellington Carillon before we
received advice that each was to bear an inscription," said Mr. Johnston. So those bells
are going to fill an order from America, where no inscription is requned.
The six Wellington bells stood in a row, and a little odd bell for another destination
was beside them. These first six bells, born at a white mid-winter Christmastide in
England, will one day peal out on a mid-summer Christmas in New Zealand, carried on
the wings of a Wellington breeze. And their voice will recall to memory the names of
our gallant dead. Silently, almost reverently, we watched at the birth of the bells.
When the mixture of copper and tin, which is heated by, a coke oven at the side, is
sufficiently hot (the degrees run into thousands), the metal is released, and runs into a
gauldroil. sending a shower of sparks, like fireworks, all around ... As the flaming liquid
was poured into the mould one could hear, in fancy, those bells ring out in the land we
call Home and their tones echo among the hills.
The pattern of the large bell had been made and the "core" of the bell was being
built up of bricks and cement, with a coating of special sand outside. When the core is
finished, to fit the pattern, it is baked, and then a final smooth coating is applied, and it is
baked again. Over this core is fitted a metal mould, with the inscription and decorations
and this is braced with an outer metal cover. The space between the core and the metal
mould with the inscription is where the molten bell-metal is poured.
It was after sunset when the bells were cast. At noon next day the outer cover
would be gradually removed, gradually for fear the sudden fierce cold might crack the
bell. In less than twenty hours the metal would be set, though cold. Ihe other hve
bells cast for Wellington were: — No. 26, "Mahara ; No. 28, La Basse ; No.
"N.Z. Permanent Forces Bell ; No. 32, Vailima ; and No. 33, Übique.

Carillon Music Described
| Extract from The Carillon of Scarpa, by bind permission of the author,
Miss Flora Klicfmann]
SUDDEN Ld from the belfry of the Cathedral the silence was startled by the sound
of the deep bell that preluded the curfew hymn. 1 hen came the first phrase. And
many of the townspeople paused to hear what was the selection for the day, since
the carilloneur had a considerable repertoire. Slowly the bells sung out m mellow tones. . .
With the second phrase, other bells were added; one bell after another entered,
weaving a wealth of glorious sound around the melody which never lost its prominence.
Up and up rose the music, the whole air was vibrating with far more sounds than the notes
struck from the bells by the player—for a bell that is in tune gives chords and more than
chords for each note struck, as the harmonics and enharmonics hum forth in octaves, fifths,
thirds, sevenths, and so on, till vibrations are reached that elude the human ear.
But who can ever describe the music of the carillon of Scarpa, or indeed of any of
the great carillons of Europe? Ihe timbre of these marvellous bells is untranslatable.
Ihe very making of such bells is a lost art. One may liken the sound to silver rain, or
'he silt of moonlight through trees; one may speak of it as rivers of melody poured forth
by a gigantic aeolian harp; but one is no nearer conveying to the uninitiated any idea of
the actual sound of a superb carillon, or its emotional effect on the hearer.
"No one can give an adequate idea of the unique beauty of the music, and its
ethereal character. No one can produce in words the haunting appeal in the singing of
the upper bells, the majesty of the bass bells, and the sense of opulence in the air vibrant
with a wealth of overtones that no other instrument can produce—sounds that hum for long
after the bells have ceased to speak. It must be heard to be understood. No one is ever
prepared for the waywardness, the unexpectedness of the tumult of music that will suddenly
shower the senses with delight and as suddenly float away, the merest gossamer-fragment
of melody, that the ear strains to catch ere it has passed beyond recall.
One secret of the mysterious charm of the carillon lies in the unearthly element
entirely beyond human control, that sways the music as it will. Man may make the bells,
may regulate them, may play upon them—but it is the wind that controls the volume of
sound, that carries it earthward or to the sky. It is the wind that wafts it far away
lowards the sunset, till it sounds like the strains of a fairy orchestra drifting across the
hills. It is the wind that suddenly flings it down, in gorgeous waves of harmony that rise
and fall in tremendous surges, thrilling the hearts of the hearers, until it seems as though
they had been permitted to catch a momentary echo of the harpers who play upon harps
of gold in the Land that knows no sound of sorrow.
d he bells of Scarpa lifted their voices. . . . Over the town the music floated, over
the meadows, over the woods to outlying farms and distant hamlets; tossed by the hill
from echo to echo, rising and falling with the trend of the wind. Higher and higher rose
the melody. ... 1 hen they sank down to the quiet finale, dhe accompaniment here was
very slight, merely sufficient to support the melody, till the last long lingering notes floated
away towards the sea though the air still whispered the message, with a thousand
murmurs, for some time after the magnetic voices of the bells themselves had ceased.
Silence at last—for a couple of minutes. And then the great E flat Bourdon
slowly boomed out the hour."


Range and Timing of Bells
range of the Wellington Carillon (Ist instalment of 49 bells) is four chromatic
octaves, and when the four additional and heavier bells are added will be extended
to four and a-half chromatic octaves. The bells are accurately tuned to Interna-
tional Pitch, C 51 7.3, and on the five-tone harmonic principle, each having its harmonics
—viz., the hum-note (octave below the strike note), nominal (octave above), tierce
(third), and quint (fifth) —in correct tune with the strike note, the bells as a whole being
in correct tune with one another.
Dr. Sydney Nicholson, Warden and Founder of the School of English Church
Music, Chislehurst, and late organist at Westminster Abbey, was engaged by the Carillon
Society at a fee of 100 guineas to test the bells for tone and tune. This test was conducted
at the foundry on 18th March, 1929, and Dr. Nicholson reported to the High Com-
missioner for New Zealand as follows:
"I have to-day made a thorough examination of the Carillon for Wellington
at the works of Messrs. Gillett & Johnston, Croydon.
"The tuning is perfect and the tone of the bells exceptionally fine. I would
specially commend the excellence of the small bells, which are so often a weak point.
"The mechanism is also admirable.
"I consider this to be an exceptionally fine Carillon.
FRIEZE ON THE BOURDON BELL. —In accordance with tradition the Bourdon
Bell of the Carillon is decorated with a special frieze. The elements of the design are
(a) the fern leaf from the badge of the New Zealand Reinforcement Drafts, and (b)
leaf of the N.Z. flax ( Phormuim tenax) , a staple product of the province of Wellington,
The shield placed on the frieze centred over the inscription, shows m the upper third
portion (chief) the Union Jack; below, on a blue ground, the four red stars edged white
representing the Southern Cross as in the Arms of the Dominion of New Zealand. Ihe
colours are represented by lines as in heraldic engravings, viz. vertical lines for led and
horizontal lines for blue. Ihe white, both in the Union Jack and the stars, is burn-
ished. The design is the work of Mr. G. N. Sturtevant, of Wellington.
COMPOSITION OF BELLS The metal of which the bells are composed consists of
an alloy of pure copper and tin, the proportions being 13 of copper to 4of tin. All the
bells are sand-blasted, thus presenting a smooth and clean appearance.
DEFINITION OF A CARILLON. —A carillon is a set of bells tuned to the notes of
the chromatic scale upon which music in two or more parts may be played; that is, airs
with accompaniment, sonatas, fugues, fantasias, and similar music. Ihe bells are fixed,
and therefore cannot be swung, and are played either by a carillonist the clavier or
automatically. The smallest number of bells to which the term carillon may be applied
correctly is two chromatic octaves consisting of 25 bells. Any less number is called,
more precisely, "a chime or peal of bells. The number of bells in a carillon may
extend to fifty-three or more.

1 UNES FOR AU I OMA lIC PLAYER.— Ihe following twelve paper tune
rolls have been supplied: "Men of Harlech," "Annie Laurie," "The Bluebells of
Scotland, dhe Bahff s Daughter of Islington," "The Last Rose of Summer," "d he
Minstrel Boy," "Begone, Dull Care," "God Bless the Prince of Wales," "God Save
the King, Drink to Me Only, ' Mendelssohn's "Spring Song," and Rubenstem's
Melody in F. The rolls, cut for two, three, and four octaves, cost £2, £3, and £4
respectively, and it is hoped that sufficient will be donated to form the nucleus of a
good carillon library in Wellington.
THE CLAPPERS.—Each bell is fitted with two clappers, one inside being
operated by the hand-clavier, and the other outside by the electro-pneumatic playing
apparatus. The clappers are of cast iron, which produces the purest tone. I hey weigh
from 2 lbs. for the smallest bells to 2 cwt. 9 lbs. for bell No. 49, and from 2 cwt.
1 qr. 8 lbs. to 4 cwt. 3 qrs. 2 lbs. for the bells still to be added.
FOUNDERS OF THE CARILLON.—Messrs. Gillett and Johnston Ltd.,
Croydon, England, the founders of the Wellington Carillon, are recognised as being
one of the leading bell-founding firms in the world. Established in 1844, they are
world-famous as the makers of church and tower clocks, bells and carillons, their most
notable achievements in recent years being the supply of the carillons for Park Avenue
Church, New York, the Houses of Parliament, Ottawa, and the Wellington Carillon.
I he reasons governing the acceptance of their tender for the Wellington Carillon were:
(1) The provision of weightier bells with greater carrying power; (2) fuller provision
in the means of access to the bells and operating mechanism, and, generally, greater
accessibility of parts needing oiling and adjustment; (3) complete dissociation throughout
of the mechanism operated by the hand clavier from that operated mechanically, thus
providing two separate instruments wholly independent of one another and each capable
of the particular adjustment best suited to it; and (4) increased range of the pedals
and better arangement of the pedal board more nearly approximating to that of an
organ. The musical quality of the Wellington bells was proved at the Newcastle-on-
I yne Exhibition and in Hyde Park, London, where crowds varying from 50,000 to
150,000 repeatedly listened to recitals. "I think it is the most perfectly-toned carillon
we have made, declared Mr. Johnston. The New Zealand agents for Messrs. Gillett
and Johnston Ltd., are Messrs. B. J. Dunsheath Ltd., of Auckland and Wellington.
ITALIAN AND LE QUESNOY BELLS.—The illustrations on page 27
give some idea of the beautiful decorations of these bells. The Le Quesnoy bell, erected
on the battlements of the town, is a tribute to the New Zealanders who captured Le
Quesnoy in the last battle of the Great War. The Rovereto bell, the largest in Italy,
stands on a romantic and massive 14th century castle, and is dedicated to all the
soldiers, Allied and enemy, who fell in the Great War. Rung by electricity, it peals
every evening for five minutes.

Wellington Citizens' War Memorial
ONE of the finest and most beautiful memorials in the British Empire, the
Wellington Citizens' War Memorial, which was dedicated on 1 7th April,
1932, stands on a commanding site at the corner of Bowen Street and
Lambton Quay, facing the main entrance gates to Parliament Grounds. Strictly
symbolical in form, adorned in white Sicilian marble, and surmounted by a magnificent
bronze casting, it pays its silent and eloquent tribute to those who "Went West" in the
Great War, and its fine massing and silhouette at once compel the attention and
reverence of the onlooker.
Approached by a handsome series of steps and flanked by high sculptured panels
in bas relief, it presents a central shrine, supporting a noble pylon, which, rising to a
height of 63 feet, bears the figure of "Victorious Youth," mounted on "Pegasus," sup-
plicating a gift from on high. Ihe flanking panels, leading to the shrine, tell their
story of the War.
The authors of the design, Messrs. Grierson, Aimer, and Draffin, architects, of
Auckland, associated with Mr. R. O. Gross, A.R.8.5., sculptor, also of Auckland,
aimed at giving concrete form to the ideal of the Committee, which was to "erect a
memorial, which, by nobility of conception, and perfection of execution, would symbolise
the glory and perpetuate the memory of the men of Wellington City and suburbs who
gave their lives at the call of the Empire." The designers felt that, not only should the
facts of sacrifice made and victory won be recorded, but that something finer and beyond
these should be included. Victorious Peace, coming after such a deluge of blood and
tears, they considered, would be but a vain achievement if we were content to rest on
the laurels so won, and the determination of this Dominion to see to it that some finer
thing should eventuate has been presented.
The sacrifice of life and hope is indicated in the two bas relief panels—one showing
the severance of ties of family affection, the aged parents losing their son and the girl
her lover, the husband parting from his wife and children to follow his comrades in
arms; the other the breaking of ties of civilian employment, women, too, answering the
call to nurse the sick and wounded. In both panels the procession is seen leaving the
things which men hold dear, to disappear from sight—into the tomb—which, in the
Memorial, is the shrine or sarcophagus, where all their sacrifice is sublimated in death.
So out of this tomb the efforts of those who "Went West" rise again etherealized
—for they fought and died, not for glory, not for territory, not for revenge or any
material thing, but for something finer out of the blue vault of Heaven. 1 hus, sur-
mounting the pylon, which grows from the tomb, is seen "Victorious Youth," in all his
beauty of physical strength, mounted on "Pegasus," the winged horse of inspiration.
On his left arm he bears the victor's wreath of laurel, and, whilst his steed tramples
underfoot the trophies of victory, he reaches up with his right arm towards the heavens
supplicating a gift from on high, realising that there is still something needed, some
added quality to make victory complete— Ihe Will to Peace." The bronze casting
is 1 4 feet high, and weighs 5 tons.
On the North-Western elevation is sculptured a panel with the device of the
pelican feeding her young from her own life's blood. 1 his is a symbol, which, through-
out the ages, has been used to denote sacrifice, and is included in this instance to represent
the sacrifices made by the women of the nation.
The Memorial, which was erected by the Hansford and Mills Construction Co.,
Ltd., cost £23,500. The area occupied by the Memorial and included in the new
street, which was formerly occupied by buildings, was purchased for £70,733, of which
the Government contributed £43,000 and the City Council the balance.
