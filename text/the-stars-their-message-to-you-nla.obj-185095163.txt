“Healing in Every Touch"
One touch of Zam-Buk starts Nature's skin healing
quicker than anything else. That’s why you should always
have Zam-Buk at hand.
If the husband gets kicked by a horse; sustains a
nasty bruise or leg wound whilst timber-cutting— or the
boys or station-hands get cuts or wounds, Zam-Buk is
the ideal antiseptic first-aid. Work of all kinds in the
country—fencing, ploughing, shearing, droving and boun-
dary-riding—results in many accidents and some of these
occupations arc conducive to skin troubles. For this
reason it pays to keep /iam-Buk always handy.
Even at home, accidents happen almost daily. Mother
gets a scald or a burn; the children going to school or
at play get many a bruise or cut —again Zam-Buk heals
perfectly and grows new skin.
Whether it be a poisoned wound, sore, abscess, ulcer,
or obstinate out-break of eczema, or other skin disease,
Zam-Buk is always to be relied upon to soothe, cleanse
and heal. Its reliability and ever-ready character have
earned for Zam-Buk the title, “A Surgery in a Two-Inch
Box.”

DO YOU KNOW
that Astrology, or the Wisdom of the Stars, is
a very old science, dating so far back in history
that there never was a time when people did not
know of it? It came down through Egypt and
Chaldea, through China and Thibet. Many great
men have believed in it in ancient and modern
days, and all the great nations of the past had
their Astrological lore.
Has Astrology a message for you? This book
is written to help you solve your problems, to
help you do the right thing at the right time, to
explain how planetary vibrations can be used and
to show you how to read character. You may
be able to reduce your difficulties, and make life
more worth while by reading this booklet right
through.
The Astronomer, Newton, said to Halley (who
discovered Halley’s comet), when the latter passed
some disparaging remark about Astrology, “I have
studied the subject, Mr. Halley, you have not.” And
Newton was a man known for his enormous scien-
tific merits. Dr. Richard Garnett, the curator of
the British Museum, was another great men who
gave witness to the truth of Astrology. So also did
the great scientist. Sir Alfred Russell Wallace, Lord
Alverctone, the late Chief Justice of England, Dr.
Henson the Bishop of Durham, and Archbishop
Usher, as well as Emerson, the great writer, and
many more.
At the present time, great interest is being shown
in Astrology all over Australia and New Zealand,
and people in all walks of life are asking eager
questions about it. Scientists claim that it can be
utilised in the training of children, in business af-
fairs, in farming and gardening operations, in
choosing a vocation. Many business men now pay
large sums annually to have their employees draft-
ed to special kinds of work, for which scientific
tests show them to be specially fitted. Is there
truth in the statement that each one of us can do
ONE THING better than all others? Edison was
born to be an inventor. Bateman, the Australian
black and white artist, began to draw as soon as
he could hold crayons. What is YOUR vocation?
Perhaps this book will give you v a line of thought
on your particular talents and prospects.
When were you Born ?
Were you born between
January 20 and February 18?
You belong to the sign
Aquarius, your,ruling planet
is Uranus, and you are diffi-
cult to understand. You are
quiet, patient, honest,
well meaning and faithful.
Friendly to all, especially
strangers, you often allow
your friends to influence you
100 greatly. You are popu-
lar, attracting many friends
and acquaintances ©specially
among the general public, but
you often feel intensely
lonely.
Very independent, at times
set and stubborn, you have
the following faults to over-
come. Vagueness, drifting
like a ship without a rudder.
Try always to have a good
plan and then stick to it.
Never break a promise or
procrastinate.
You have a good eye for
colour, some ability to design
and invent things. Dress-
making, gardening, music,
artistic work, literary work,
work in connection with
large companies, are Aquar-
ian occupations. Not being
too anxious to marry you
would take a good while to
make up your mind about it,
but would make a trust-
worthy mate, oncfe you de-
cided.
Your likes and dislikes
are strong, and you can
be won by love but
never driven. Your col-

Neptune. You are usually
misunderstood, you are not
determined or positive but
very emotional and variable.
You like to dream dreams,

too much, and become des-
pondent. You are good na-
tured, kind, generous, ready
to help others, but you need
to cultivate self-reliance and

Have You a Skin Trouble? Zam-Buk Will Soon Put You Right.
Helps for Farmers
The farmer can use
these rules with all expec-
tation of success, if times,
seasons, locality, soil,
moisture, fertility, shine
and shade are observed,
combined with the best
agricultural knowledge
that is available. These
notes are not intended to
REPLACE any common
sense methods, but if used
in connection with regu-
lar farming operations
they will increase the
fruits of labour.
It is a fact well known
to many gardeners, nur-
serymen, and Astrologers,
that the seeds which are
sown in the decrease or
wane of the moon
(through the third or
fourth quarter) never
thrive so well as those
which are set at new or
increase of the moon and
in a fruitful sign.
All crops that produce
their yield ABOVE the
the ground should be
planted at the increase of
the moon. Plant seed for
corn, wheat, barley, rye
and other grains when the
moon is increasing. All
crops that produce their
yield DOWN IN the
ground should be planted
during the old or decrease
of the moon, and in a
fruitful sign.
PAINFUL BOILS BANISHED
“Boils which extended over my arms and a con-
siderable portion of my back caused me a good deal
of pain,” writes Miss M. Sidoti, of 51 Arthur Street,
Lavender Bay, North Sydney. “Although under
medical treatment my complaint showed no im-
provement, the only apparent result being that the
boils broke out again in other places. Finally I
decided to use Zam-Buk and I found that the first
dressing brought immediate relief from the itching
and irritation. Prom that time the swellings sub-
sided and in about a week the sores healed per-
fectly and new healthy skin grew over them. I can
strongly recommend Zam-Buk in any similar case
to my own.”
Disease germs are the root cause of boils, ab-
scesses, etc., and for destroying and expelling these
there is nothing so good as Zam-Buk which sub-
dues pain, reduces inflammation, expels poisonous
matter, and heals completely.
Useful Hints
Encourage children to
drink cold water; it clean-
ses the system. Fruit
should be given at break-
fast time.
• • *
The safest and most
soothing dressing for
children’s skins is Zam-
Buk used in accordance
with the directions.
* * *
Children should b e
taught to drink milk in
sips, otherwise it curdles
in the stomach.
• * •
It is far safer to "keep
to Zam-Buk for children’s
skin troubles than to ex-
periment with unknown
ointments. Zam-Buk com-
bines safety with thorough
reliability. It has a won-
derful record of success in
the treatment of child-
ren’s skin complaints.
* * *
“It would take many
pages to tell you all we
use Zam-Buk for,” says
Mrs. E. Blizard, Bllen-st..
Semaphore, S.A. “Suffice
to say it never fails. My
children’s faith in Zam-
Buk is so great that their
tears are dried and their
pain eased as soon as the
balm is applied.”
ings greatly influence you,
and you inwardly fret and
chafe at circumstances. You
have great sympathy for
dumb creatures, and all who
are sick and suffering. In
financial matters you are not
very saving, nor a very prac-
tical person.
This sign Pisces produces
many poets, writers and nov-
elists, musicians, and stage
folk. It gives a great love of
the sea, and many born at
this time become sailors and
fishermen. Other vocations
that belong to this, birth
month are accountancy,
storekeeping, catering, the
church, army and navy, work
in large institutions such as
hospitals and colleges, and
Govt, positions where the sal-
ary is steady and regular, all
being suitable.
In regard to love and mar-
riage you would be strongly
inclined to love or marry
more than once. Yet there
are many born in this month
who cheerfully stay single.
Your lucky day is Thursday,
your colour sea green, your
stone the pearl.
Were you born between
MARCH 21 and APRIL 21 ?
You belong to the sign
Aries, and your ruling planet
is Mars. You possess energy,
love of action, and you love
to lead and have your own
way. You are impulsive, self
reliant, hopeful, but you are
not gifted with patience, and
are often irritable and rest-
less. Independent and self-
confident, you are one of the
people who get things done,
your courage is dauntless,
and if you fail in one direc-
tion, you immediately try
another.
You are light hearted and
hopeful, a born fighter and
pioneer, but you do best to
make plans for others to
carry out; women born un-
der this sign are impatient
of long seams and of finish-
ing off details. You are very
frank and out-spoken, some-

and i esponsibility appeal to
you.
You would be best fitted for
professional life or any bus-
iness where there was a
quick and rapid turnover.
Amongst Aries people we find
good agents, organisers, bro-
kers, auctioneers, surveyors,
inspectors, foremen, actors,
guides and travellers, estate
agents, designers, soldiers
and surgeons.
You would be anxious to
marry and make a good
mate. Your fortunate day is
Tuesday, your colour bright

Were you born between
APRIL 22 and MAY 21 ?
Then you belong to the
sign Taurus, and your ruling
)lanet is Venus. Self-reliance
and stubbornness are your
principal characteristics
You are good hearted and de-
voted in friendship, but you
wish to stay in the place for
which you feel you are best
suited, and do not move
without clear reasons. Your
success lies where steadiness
a;id persistent striving are
required, for you are solid,
reserved, practical and mat-
ter of fact, patient and plod-
ding, and reliable.
You are easy going, you
do not criticize, nor worry
unnecessarily. Yow temper
is usually sunny and good
tempered, and you stand a
great deal without complaint;
it takes a great amount of
goading to excite you, but
when once thoroughly arous-
ed, you would be in a great
temper generally to the sur-
prise of those who had at-
tacked you. You feel deeply,
and your feelings are very
concentrated, and sometimes
you would be capable of fits
of jealousy and obstinacy. At
other times you would have
to watch for the fault of in-
dolence.
You belong to a type that
seldom remains single, and

USEFUL HINTS
A foreign substance pre-
sent in a wound should
first be removed by a
sterilised needle or a pair
of tweezers, if it is a
splinter, or by cleansing
with water which has
been boiled, if it is dirt.

Mrs. F. Walters, of 214
Bathurst Street, Hobart,
Tas., says:—“A poisonous
dye got into a scratch on
my hand. The wnole arm
became swollen and was
full of pain and inflamma-
tion. On a friend’s recom-
mendation, I got Zam-
Buk, and from the first it
brought wonderful ease.
As I kept on with Zam-
Buk swelling and inflam-
mation was overcome and
the sore was thoroughly
purified and healed.”
♦ ♦ ♦
When not using your
Zam-Buk, always keep
the box closed and the
contents properly covered
with the circular wax
slip provided in the lid
for that purpose.

Helps for Farmers
Vegetables, plants,
vines, and all things
that produce theii* yield
ABOVE the ground, such
as peas, beans, tomatoes,
lettuce, cabbage, etc.,
should be planted during
the increase of the moon
(before full moon), and
the very choicest time is
during the second quarter.
This should also be ob-
served for pruning, graft-
ing, budding and trans-
planting.
• • •
Those who do their
planting, trimming, etc.,
according to Astrology,
should also observe such
notes as these. Never
break off a limb from a
valuable tree. Always
make a smooth cut. Give
each tree plenty of room.
Trim your trees so as to
give a free open top, . o
two limbs crossing or
touching each other. In
transplanting a tree be
careful to set it facing
the same points of the
compass as before. .In
setting out, the roots
should not be bunched or
cramped.

“new” during the first
and second quarters, when
it is INcreasing in light.

Scald causes Blood Poisoning
“I had the misfortune to upset half-a-gal!on of
boiling water over my right foot,” writes Mr. Guth-
rie F. Long, of “Viola,” Rosebery Road, Guildford,
N.S.W. “In addition to the terrible pain caused by
the scald, dirt got into the exposed flesh and set
up a dreadful state of festering and inflammation;
The limb was in such a state that for weeks it was
impossible for me to work.
I experimented with several ointments and heal-
ing salves, but it was not until I began to dress
the limb with Zam-Buk that it gave real signs of
healing. From the first Zam-Buk was wonderfully
soothing and its persistent use reduced swelling,
expelled all poisonous matter from the wound and
healed perfectly with fine new skin. My foot is
now as sound as ever before.”

ing the third and fourth
quarters when it is DB-
creasing in light.
** ♦ ♦
Potatoes and other root
crops should be planted
shortly after full moon
and during the daytime.
At that period the moon
will be under the earth,
which tends to create
good root formations.
* • *
If it is wished to grow
seed quickly, it should be
planted when the moon is
rising. Harvest all root
crops when the moon is
growing old, they keep
better and longer. Dig
root crops for seed in the
third quarter of the moon.
They will keep longer,
are drier and better.
* « *
Set fence posts at old
of the moon and they will
not ‘heave’ out. Dig foun-
dations for houses in the
third quarter of the moon
also. Also make cement.
Spray and otherwise des-
troy vermin, rodents and
pests in the fourth quar-
ter - of the moon.
» • *
Harvesting should be
done just after full moon,
or in the third quarter.
For shipping purposes
gather fruits or vegetables
just before full moon in
the second quarter.
Barber’s Rash Healed
“For a long time I had an unsightly rash on my
chin which was contracted at the barbers,” writes
Mr. R. M. Miller, of 271 Mile Camp, Paynesville,
W.A. “Every time I shaved it caused intense pain.
I had spent a lot of money on other things be-
fore I tried the sample of Zam-Buk. Even this
small trial quantity gave relief, so I bought a regu-
lar size box of the balm and continued the treat-
ment. Zam-Buk is truly a wonderful thing for the
skin. It soothed away soreness and irritation, drew
all impurity out of the skin, and cleared away the
rash. I can now shave in perfect comfort, which I
had not been able to do for nearly four years.
As a remedy for sore and eruptive conditions of
the skin Zam-Buk should be widely recommended.’’
USEFUL HINTS
To make linen easier to
write on when marking
it, dip the part to be
marked in cold starch,
and the pen will write
without scratching.

Enamel baths can be
thoroughly cleaned with a
flannel dipped in kerosene.
They should not be scrub-
bed with soap, as this
cracks the enamel.

Whilst playing football,
Mr. R. L. Potter, of 212
Park-st., Hobart, Tas.,
sustained a very nasty
bruised hip. “Although I
tried many kinds of oint-
ment,” he says, “the
place continued painful
and unsightly; but I was
delighted to notice the
improvement after the
very first applications of
Zam-Buk. All trace of
the trouble finally disap-
peared as I continued the
Zam-Buk treatment.”
* • •
Zam-Buk is so refined
that it soaks naturally
into the skin without any
need of rubbing. Dress
your skin daily with this
pure herbal Zam-Buk and
it will put you in better
health. Nothing like a
rub down with Zam-Buk
for that “vigorous, well
feeling.”

“Given up hope of Cure"
SAYS MR. KYLE.
SO years of age, yet ZAM-BUK brings
relief from Eczema of 30 years standing
This letter from a well-known identity of the
Newcastle (N.S.W.) district, demonstrates once
more the wonderful healing power of Zam-Buk. It
is one of many thousands received from ail .parts
of Australia and New Zealand, proving beyond
doubt that in serious skin troubles Zam-Buk may
be absolutely relied upon.
Writing from “Cathay,” Belmont Road, Charles-
town, Mr. Thos. D. Kyle says:—
“My experience of Zam-Buk is rather remarkable
seeing that lam now 80 years of age. For the last
30 years I have suffered from eczema on my left leg
from the Instep nearly up to the knee. During
this time I have spent a small fortune on oint-
ments, dressings and liquid medicines, and have
stayed three months in a hospital, but nothing did
me any good.
“Owing to my age I had given up hope of a cure,
but reading of a simila-r case in one of the New-
castle papers, I decided to try the complete Zam-
Buk treatment. In addition to the Zam-Buk balm
I bought a box of Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap,
and I carefully followed the directions given.
After persevering for a month I began to see an
improvement. Continued treatment eventually
healed up the old sores completely, and to my great
relief and delight new skin grew over the place.
I have hesitated about letting you know of this, as
I wanted to be quite sure that the cure was lasting,
MR. T. D. KYLE
(from a photo).
but I have no doubt at all
now as it is seven months
since the place healed.
The frightful irritation,
the money wasted and the
inconvenience I had to
contend with might all
have been saved had I
given Zam-Buk and Zam-
Buk Soap a good trial
earlier.”
Burns & Scalds
Of all accidents to the skin, burns
and scalds require most urgent atten-
tion. There is always a great amount
of shock and pain, and serious inflam-
mation and skin poisoning may de-
velop. After the raw flesh has been
carefully cleansed in tepid water, Zam-
Buk should be applied direct to the
skin or on strips of lint. Place a
layer or two of cotton wool on the lint,
then bandage carefully to keep dress-
ing in place.
Z a m - Buk
soothes the
smarting pain,
draws out the
‘Are’ and checks
any tendency
towards poison-
ing or ulcera-
tion. The under-
lying tissue is
made healthy
and Zam-Buk
then grows new
skin.
New Zealand Rugby Tourists
“ALL-BLACKS,” 1926-27.
Mr. E. H. Mair, Manager and Coach,
writes:—-“We have found Zam-Buk of
splendid service for all first-aid and em-
brocation purposes. With such a heavy
programme our men are often down with
injury, but with Zam-Buk we can always
be sure of their being in the game again
in the shortest possible time.
Dangerous Bites and Stings
The bites of mosquitos, ants, spiders,
centipedes, scorpions, not only mean tem-
porary discomfort but
there is always the pos-
s i b i 1 it y of swellings,
rashes, or poisoned sores
forming. Guard against
these troubles by apply-
ing Zam-Buk right away.
Besides cooling the skin,
this magical balm quickly
removes poisons, subdues
the smarting pain and irritation, and in-
duces quick clean healing.


Helps for Farmers
The influence of the sun
is fiery and positive. It
impresses by force while
that of the moon is cool-
ing, moist and magnetic
or attractive.
“Each star has
its own glory.’
and the vibrations they
create are entirely differ-
ent from those of the sun,
yet both kinds are essen-
tial. Botanists have shown
that many plants do actu-
ally grow more at night
than during the day.
* * *
Grain intended for fu-
ture use or seed should be
harvested at the increase
of the moon. Pick apples
and pears in the old of the
moon, and the bruised
spots will dry up; if
picked in new of the
moon, spots will rot.
* ♦ *
Timber cut in the old of
the moon will season well
and will not warp or de-
cay or snap in the burn-
ing:. Fence posts, tele-
graph poles and founda-
tions should be laid and
set during the old of the
moon —the darker the bet-
ter. This does not mean
that it should be done at
night. But during those
days in the month when
the moon is in .its darkest
q uarter.

Weeds, bushes and nox-
ious growths are best des-
troyed in the dark of the

Cold Sores—Chapped Hands
“I am employed on the Kalgoorlie water stipply,
and often in the cold and frosty weather my hands
used to get badly sore, roughened and cracked,”
writes Mr." James Gribble, 517 Hannan Street, Kal-
goorlie, W.A. “In Zam-Buk I found a quick sure
healer for these troubles. I have been able to avoid
all further suffering by use of Zam-Buk. Rubbed
well into the hands before I start out in the morn-
ing - it keeps the skin in strong perfect condition.
If I chance to get cuts and bruises from the tools
I use, a little Zam-Buk soon gets things right. It
is a fine safeguard against festering and blood
poison dangers.”
USEFUL HINTS
Save Soap. —Each cake
of Zam-Buk Medicinal
Soap is hollowed on the
top. When one cake is
worn thin it can be
pressed into the hollow of
the new cake. This pre-
vents any waste of this
valuable medicinal soap.

Zam-buk
Will Soothe, Heal and Protect
Your Child’s Skin
orders common amongst children, Zam-
Buz is invaluable. It expels poison and
disease and restores the skin to a healthy
state.
Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap should be used
for washing all sore places, also regularly

Treasure the
health, purity and
beauty of your
child’s skin. Re-

as a possible source
of disease. Treat

This pure herbal
balm soothes and

Accidents
will Happen !
The Need for ZAM-BUK
At any moment at home, at work,
or going to or from school, you or
your children are liable to receive cuts,
bruises, burns and flesh wounds.
Injury to the skin means a breaking
of the protective layer of epidermis
and the admission of hordes of
germs that set up poisoning or fes-
tering. Be ready with Zam-Buk !
The medicinal action of Zam-Buk is
threefold. Firstly, where skin is sore
or inflamed, Zam-Buk instantly cools
and soothes. Secondly, Zam-Buk is a
most valuable antiseptic. It purifies
the damaged exposed tissues, kills off
disease germs and averts dangerous
complications. Thirdly, Zam-Buk pro-
motes rapid natural healing and grows
healthy new skin. If you could see
Zam-Buk knitting the edges of a
wound together you would witness the

Emergency Home Hints
CUTS & BRUISES.—
First cleanse the broken
surface of the skin with
warm water and, if need-
ed, with a little Zam-Buk
Medicinal Soap. After
drying tenderly', smear
Zam-Buk over the affec-
ted part and cover up
with a handkerchief or a
strip of clean lint band-
age.
COLDS & CHILLS.—
Treat cold in the head by
rubbing Zam-Buk on the
palms of the hands and
inhaling the pleasant eva-
porating balsams. An-
other method is to insert
a little balm in the nos-
trils. Either way soon
clears the head * and
soothes the inflamed
membranes. To remove
the effects of bodily chill
rub Zam-Buk, slightly
warmed, vigorously into
affected part.
BAD. LEGS.— Sufferers
from ulcers, chronic sores,
etc., will find hints on
page 10 which should
prove very valuable.
BURNS & SCALDS.—
Cut off the clothing from
the injured part. Do not
attempt to drag it off,
and if any adhere to the
burn, soak it off in tepid
or cold water before at-
tempting to dress the
limb. For information as
to treatment by Zam-
Buk see article on page 5.
INSECT BITES & Stings.
—First remove the sting,
if present, by gentle
squeezing, then smear
well with Zam-Buk, and
cover with a bandage to
prevent the place being
rubbed. [See page 5 for
further particulars].
SPRAINS & STRAINS.—
Apply hot fomentations,
and w'hen the swelling has
subsided somew'hat, an-
oint the injured part lib-
erally with Zam-Buk,
then bandage firmly, but
not too tightly. Rest un-
til the injured limb is
strong again.
CRAMP. —Relax the mus-
cles as quickly as possible
by vigorous rubbing wuth
Zam-Buk. Rub one way
only—away from the
heart.
RHEUMATISM & MUS-
CULAR PAINS.— Two or
three times daily rub
Zam-Buk for several mi-
nutes into the parts af-
fected; then cover with
warm flannel, and wear
warm clothing always.
Adopt a plain, light diet.
SORE, ACHING FEET.
Wash nightly w'ith Zam-
Buk Medicinal Soap and
w r arm water, and dress
with the Zam-Buk heal-
ing balm. . Protect blis-
ters carefully with a clean
rag or lint.
EYE & EAR. —If a part-
icle of grit or a tiny in-
sect gets into the eye,
don’t rub. Blow the nose
hard. Pull down and de-
press the lower part of
the eyelid. If this fails
to dislodge the offending
substance, get someone
to remove it with the
twnsted corner of a hand-
kerchief. Look upward
during the process. To
dislodge foreign bodies in
ear, gently syringe. If it
be an insect intruder a
few drops of olive oil will
kill it, when it can be
removed at leisure.
PILES or HAEMORR-
HOIDS.—There is no bet-
ter soother and remedy
than Zara-Buk. [See ar-
- tide on page 7].
RINGWORM.—It is usu-
ally advisable to cut the
hair, then shampoo the
scalp thoroughly with
Zam-Buk Soap and warm
water every morning. Af-
terwards apply the Zama
Buk balm either with till
fingers or on a clean line*
rag. Dressing again a’

Ointments come and ointments go, but Zam-Buk remains unrivalled. The
relief it gives is almost miraculous! Smarting pain is stopped, irritation al-
layed, inflammation subdued, the tissues cleansed and purified and the growth of
a new healthy skin begun. Just a daily dressing with Zam-Buk. How simple
—and comforting. Nothing safer —or so sure.
The unique properties of Zam-Buk —
healing, soothing, germicidal, antisep-
tic, and deodorant—all spring: from its
wonderful formula and ingenious com-
pounding. Zam-Buk is of herbal origin
and free from the lard and other rancid
animal fats that deprive common oint-
ments of their “keeping” qualities.
The proportion of the valuable herbal
extracts and the manner in which they
arc brought together in Zam-Buk were
only ascertained by long and costiy
experiment, but the result is a pre-
paration of the highest medicinal
merit and refinement.
Owing to its remarkable refinement
Zam-Buk is absorbed by the pores and
gets down into the tissues. Thus Zam-
Buk heals from Below and does not lie
useless on the skin surface. Zam-Bul
expels all badness from the tissues
keeps them “clean” and healthy. It en-
aoles the skin to recover its own norma
functions. The regular use of Zam-Bul
ensures perfect skin health.
Whatever your skin trouble try dail;
anointings with this pure and mos
potent balm —Heal it with Zam-Buk!

Fiery Itchy
ECZEMA
Eczema, or Tetter, is
the commonest of skin
diseases. It generally
begins in the form of
slightly reddened pat-
ches, on which appear
tiny watery heads that
burst and lead to the
formation of thin
crusts of bright red
hue. The mattery dis-
charge, when thick
and gummy, cakes and
forms into unsightly
scabs; then the inflam-
mation is succeeded
by fiery itching of a
most intense charac-
ter.
Wet Eczema has
this "mattering” as its
chief feature. Dry Ec-
is known by the red scaly patches
v fiich, though swollen, are never moist.
Eczema attacks any part of the body, but
it most frequently breaks out behind the
ea^, s n< ? ln the joints of the arms, legs
and teet. Ordinary Eczema, in the in-
flammatory stage, is accompanied by in-
tense heat and burning, followed by scab-
nmg and itching. A very common form
otten attacks young children, and is
termed scald-head.
HOW TO APPLY ZAM - BUK.—Zam-
t>uk is best applied night and morning on
a fresh piece of clean rag or lint. The
burning, itching pain will be speedily al-
layed and further perseverance with
Zam-Buk soon results in a new soft
hea-thy skin, with the power of carrying
°? II s at i lral functions, taking the place
of the disfiguring scabs and scales.
Absolute cleanliness is vital in the treat-
ment of skin disease, and when changing
the dressings it is always advisable to
bathe the affected parts with Zam-Buk
Medicinal Soap. This valuable new aid
to the treatment is renowned for its pur-
ity, its freedom from uncombined alkali,
and its eminent suitability and excellence.
The worst sufferer from eczema soon finds
lasting relief in this splendid Zam-Buk
treatment.
Sir Alan Cobham
Sir ALAN COBHAM, the famous British
Airman and hero of many wonderful
flights, carries Zam-Buk in'his first-aid
outfit. The fact is significant of the re-
liability of Zam-Buk as a “Surgery in a
Two-Inch Box.”


Do you Know ?
The moon has a great
influence over life and
growth. Not only can this
be seen in her effect upon
the tides, but also on ve-
getation and all growing
things. Mushrooms and
crabs are best and most
plentiful at full moon.
The moon also influences
health. Wounds heal bet-
ter during the increase of
the moon. For operations
it is better to choose a
time when the moon is
Increasing in light. Luna-
tics and mental cases are

gest the facts they have

healthy and well peo-
ple would benefit much
from a daily sun bath.
The sun’s rays will not
benefit when they pass

and eyes should be shad-
ed during sun-bathing.
Ulcers, Bad Legs, etc.
Ulcers may start with a tiny scratch, cut or
knock, or the flesh may break down and slough
awaj in ulcers through sheer weakness, brought on
(especially in the case of women) by excessive
standing or kneeling, or by varicose veins, etc.
Ulcers and other flesh-eating sores are not, how-
ler, peculiar to women. Many men, too, know the
iwful pain, boat, and irritation which arc present
vyith the sufferer night and day—which destroy
deep, and render it impossible to struggle about
n the daytime. In such cases, dressings with Zam-
Buk will be found most beneficial.
This herbal balm drives out disease, and succeeds
n the severest cases of ulceration, because its an-
iseptic, germicidal, and disease-destroying powers
ire backed by unique healing properties. Zam-Buk
ictually helps to build up new tissue-cells, and the
■esult is that once-diseased parts become sound
strong, firm and clear—a healing that is perfect
md permanent.
USEFUL HINTS

You would choose a field of
activity where you would
have to take responsibility,
for you have a strong self-

you will be very popular with
other people. Honourable,
generous in money matters,
high-minded, warm-hearted,
you would have a love of
music, singing, poetry, or
amateur theatricals, or even
the professional stage.
You would have a love of
the opposite sex, of luxury
and a good time, and you
would not hesitate to come
forward to amuse, instruct or
direct others. You have great
faith, taking your friends on
trust, refusing to hear any
ill spoken of them, and you
would prefer a painful truth
any day to a twisted state-
ment of fact.
In love you would be over-

and unwise friendships.
Suitable occupations would

Many old superstitions
are connected with the
planets. ‘‘Turn your mo-
ney at the new moon”
has a basis of fact. For
new moon is the best time
for investing, buying, sell-
ing and trading, thus
turning your money over
from one use to another,
and from one person to
another, making it move;
but to-day we think that
it literally means just
turning over the coins in
the pocket.
Another old superstition
is that it is unlucky to
spill salt. Salt is ruled by
the planet Saturn, which
is considered to be an un-
fortunate planet. It some-
times sits darkly in horo-
scopes, and brings sorrow
and affliction, hence the
old saying ‘‘to spill salt
is to spill sorrow.”
For the same reason we
have the superstition that
to wear green is unlucky.

turn, and Saturn is known
as ‘‘The Reaper” becausfe
he causes bereavements.
‘‘Put on green, and you
will put on black” is a
saying that arose from
this old knowledge. But
the real truth has be-
come distorted. Green is
a beautiful colour, much
used by Nature, and if
hapnonious to us, we can
wear it with great benefit.
Fall from bicycle causes bad leg
“Whilst out riding-, I had the misfortune to be
thrown from my bicycle, sustaining severe injuries
to my leg.” writes Mr. George Bishop, 75 Renwick
Street, Redfern, Sydney.
“In spite of months of treatment -with various
healing preparations, the condition of the limb
showed no sign of improvement, in fact it threat-
ened to become chronic. My leg was in a most
serious condition when I made up my mind to give
Zam-Buk a good trial. Even from the first this
balm soothed and gave positive benefit. As I con-
tinued the applications regularly the sore places
were purified and thoroughly healed, and the limb
made quite sound and healthy again.”
USEFUL HINTS
The difficulty of prepar-
ing and getting herbs at

obstacle to herbal medi-
cines.

Zam-Buk Soap
The
World’s
most
richly
medicated
Soap
For sensitive skins and especially
where there is any sign of eruption or
disease, Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap is
strongly recommended. This famous
Soap is' super-fatted and has no trace
of the ‘free alkali’ which makes ordi-
nary soap so unsafe for use on delicate
skins. Possessing a high and definite
proportion of the active medicinal pro-
perties that have made Zam-Buk Balm
so famous, Zam-Buk Soap well merits
its claim to be the most richly medi-
cated soap in the world.
By the use of Zam-Buk Medicinal
Soap the tissues are soothed and
cleared of impurities and the skin’s
important functions are restored to
normal activity, with the result that
the tissues re-assume their soft, pli-
able, healthy condition.
Used as a shampoo for the hair,
Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap arrests irri-
tation, dandruff, scurfy patches, and
keeps the scalp fresh and healthy.
Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap is highly re-
commended for babies and young
children on account of its delicacy and
purity.
Sold in single tablets or box contain-
ing three tablets from all chemists.

Weakening Agonising
PIL ES!
Mr. Wm. Simpsor
“For piles I have found Zam-Buk simp-
ly wonderful,” writes Mr. William Simp-
son from Annerly Road, South Brisbane,
Q’land. ‘‘l was a great sufferer for nearly
five years and had tried many well-known
remedies without effect. I could not ob-
tain relief until I used Zam-Buk. This
balm soothed and eased the trouble until
finally I had permanent relief.”
Mrs. W. Fricker, of 392 Armagh Street,
Linwood, N.Z., writes:—“A bad attack
of bleeding piles caused me weeks of most
indescribable agony. I used all manner
of ointments and ‘pile cures’ and took
medicines which the doctors prescribed,
but without practical result; in fact, the
pains grew so frequent and severe that I
could not lie down or even sit down with-
out undergoing intense suffering.
“One day my husband brought me a box
of Zam-Buk to try. Soon after the first
application of Zam-Buk I began to feel
great relief from the burning, itching
pains. I continued the Zam-Buk dressings
regularly, and to such effect that the piles
were quickly and thoroughly banished.”
The weakening agony
of piles robs life of its
pleasures, turns days
of brightness into days
of misery and periods
of acute suffering.
Many sufferers re-
late how they wasted
£’s in useless salves
and pile ointments be-
fore they found speedy
and permanent relief

Blood Poisoning
Strength is powerless against
germ infection, and the smallest
cut, wound, or scratch should
never be neglected. Almost ev-
ery day instances are recorded
of limbs being sacrificed and of
deaths arising through trivial
injuries.
A simple, yet effective ‘safety
first’ measure against the perils
of blood-poison, lock-jaw, gan-
grene ,etc., is to apply Zam-
Buk to every skin injury. The
wonderful antiseptic and germi-
cidal properties in Zam-Buk
quickly kill. and expel disease
germs. Quick, clean healing
then follows. When festering
or suppuration has already ta-
ken place, Zam-Buk allays pain
and inflammation, reduces swell-
ing and draws out all corrup-
tion.

Monday is the moon’s day,
and as the moon rules
water it is the best day
for doing the washing.
Tuesday is Mars’ day, and
as Mars rules fire and
heat it is best for ironing-
day. Wednesday is Mer-
cury’s day, and as he is
the planet of mind and
manual dexterity, this is
the best day for sewing,
mending and letter-writ-
ing. Thursday is ruled by
Jupiter, the social day for
self-expression. It is the
day for visiting and re-
ceiving calls, for lessons
in music, painting, etc.,
for going to class or club,
for gardening and re-
creation. Friday is Frig-
ga’s day, which is the
Norse name for Venus. It
is the day for sweeping
and garnishing and mak-
ing beautiful the home,
and bringing order in
place of disorder. Satur-
day is Saturn’s day, the
last day in the week, and
Saturn stands for good
works completed, there-
fore the first half of this
day is usually a busy rush
while the second half is a
holiday. Sunday is the
Sun’s day, the first in the
week, a day of beginnings,
a fresh start, a day of
rest and worship.
Foot saved by Zam-Buk
Writing from the Department of Trade and
Customs, Rabaul, Mr. C. B. Coates, says
“ Whilst visiting outlying islands, I had the
misfortune to cut my ankle severely on a
submerged piece of coral. The injury gave great
pain and swelled alarmingly. As soon as I got
back to Rabaul I had to lay up. Medical treat-
ment failed to the ghastly wound. All kinds
of ‘remedies’ too, brought no good results. I was
so reconciled to the idea of having my foot taken
off. that I decided to send in my resignation
“One day happening to be in the store I bought a
box of Zam-Buk. After two or three applications,
the discharge grew less and the angry-looking
wound began to get healthier. I persevered w'ith
the treatment and now, thanks solely to Zam-Buk
complete healing has resulted. Zam-Buk saved
me from being a cripple the rest of my life ’’
sometimes indolent, knd you
need to cultivate will power
and perseverance. You have
a great craving for beauty
and harmony in life, and you
work best with other people,
and love to have companion-
ship about you. You possess
good humour and a hopeful,
buoyant spirit.
You will have some taste or
ability for music or one of
the fine arts, and vocations
for this birth month are
found amongst artists, sing-
ers, musicians, designers, li-
brarians, secretaries, and
makers of pretty and luxuri-
ous things. Hairdressers and
beauty experts belong to this
sign. In the professions, law
would be the suitable voca-
tion.
You must choose your mate
carefully if you would have
happiness. To you the hus-
band or wife would count
far more than the children,
and you would not crave
parenthood half so much as
a happy love life.
Your lucky day is Friday,
your colour blue, your gem
the sapphire.
Were you born between
OCT. 23 and NOV. 21 7
Then you belong to the sign
Scorpio, your ruling planet is
Mars, which shows that you
are a strong character, a re-
served, secretive and proud
person, and so seldom wholly
understood. Your likes
and dislikes are strong, and
you are very clever at getting
at the bottom ••of things and
detecting mysteries. You
take offence easily but do
not always show it. You like
to get at the roots of every-
thing, and you are apt to be
sceptical and sarcastic until
you are convinced of a truth,
after which you work hard
for it.
This birth month produces
some great contrasts, some
of the worst and some of the
best people being born under
it. But by the depth and
blackness of the shadow can
we measure the tower of
light and comfort that the
good side of Scorpio means.
You may be lazy until you
are interested, then work is
play to you, leisure bores
you, and you never want to
relax until you are worn out
completely. You should avoid
faultfinding.
Suitable occupations would
be medicine and surgery,
nursing, chemistry, dentistry,
electrical work, or as detec-
tives, or Govt, officials. You
should choose your marriage
partner with care. Your
lucky day is Tuesday, your
colour red, your stone the
topaz.
Were you born between
NOV. 21 and DEC. 20 7
Then you belong to Sagit-
tarius, your ruling star is
Jupiter, and you are bright,
hopeful, impressionable, ac-
tive and enterprising, with a
good share of practical com-
mon sense, and a friendly
and general interest in your
fellow creatures. You love
to argue and although affec-
tionate, you love liberty and
freedom, and at times are
inclined to be too blunt and
outspoken. No one knows
better how to find the weak
spot in another’s armour, or

Whatever Your
Skin Trouble
Whether it be just a pimple or an
angry patch of eczema —dress the place
at once with that rare herbal balm
Zam-Buk. Beautifully soothing, swiftly
healing and highly antiseptic!
So refined is Zam-Buk that it soaks
down through the pores and HEALS
FROM BELOW, predisposing the en-
tire skin to perfect health. You can
“rub it in” for sprains, strains, stiff-
ness, muscular pains, etc. Zam-Buk is
the last word in skin healing!
Miss D. Southern, Goul-
burn Street. Singleton,
N.S.W., writes: “I had
running sores on four of
my fingers causing pain
which kept me awake at
night. Medical advice
proved useless, but for-
Innately I was advised to
try Zam-Buk. The re-
suit was a complete cure
In a very short time and
I have had no return of
the trouble.”
Miss B. Mack, GManville
Blocks P. 0., Via Port Ad-
elaide, writes: “For seven
years I suffered from
weeping eczema on my
wrist. After trying all
manner of ointments and
lotions a friend induced
me to try Zam-Buk. Su r- ■
prising relief followed the
first few applications and
in a short time the sore-
ness and eruptions were
completely banished.

To make hair grow lux-
uriantly, see that it is
trimmed during ntw
moon, but ladies with
bobbed hair who do not
want it to grow out too
Quickly should trim when
the moon is in the third
and fourth quarters.
When to set eggs.—Eggs
should be set so that on
the 21st day they hatch
while the moon is increas-
ing in light and in a fruit-
ful sign. Then the chicks
will mature rapidly and
be prolific layers, whereas
if hatched during the de-
crease in a barren sign
they will in no way prove
so satisfactory. Chickens
require 21 days, ducks and
turkeys 28 days, geese 30
days.
To kill pigs.—Do this
between eight and ten in
the morning, and between
the first quarter and the
full of the moon. The pigs
will weigh more and the
flavour of the pork be
improved.
The sun, moon and pla-
nets very greatly influence
weather. “An evening red
and a morning grey, will
set a traveller on his way:
but an evening grey and
a morning red will pour
down rain on a traveller’s
head.’’ Mars causes beat
and Saturn cold. Jupiter
brings fine weather.
Poisoned Thumb Healed
“ My thumb was badly poisoned, the constant
throbbing pains so intense, that they prevented
sleep at nights. The swelling and inflammation
grew alarming,’’ writes Mrs. Winifred Wright, 5
Clive Square, Napier, H. 8., New Zealand.
“After trying other preparations without avail, I
obtained a free sample box of Zam-Buk, and even
this brought definite relief. I immediately pur-
chased a large box and steadily persevered with
the Zam-Buk. Under its influence all poison and
corruption was quickly drawn out of the sore, pain
and inflammation disappeared, and the thumb
healed perfectly with new healthy skin.”
If you have not tried Zam-Buk send for a free
sample as mentioned on page 11.

Always straightforward and
independent your mind will
always be digging into some
new matter, and an unfin-
ished task is an Intolerable
affliction, for you are unwill-
ing to wait for proper times
and seasons.
You will always meet a big
crisis bravely, but trifles up-
set you, and you go all to
pieces if you try to do two
things at once. Your out-
look is optimistic and you
mind your own business.
Marriage should be fortu-
nate for you, for you are
easy to get on with, but if
unhappily mated, you would
take it very hardly, and
would get hopeless. Two love
affairs or marriages would
be a feature of your life.
You would be ardent and af-
fectionate.
Your birth month produces
many who are clever at tea-
ching and preaching, and the
law and the church appeal to
many born under it. Design-
ing, and all kinds of light
work where you are brought
into contact with others is
suitable. There is also a
sporting type born at this
time, horse trainers and
breeders, good riders, excel-
lent marksmen, tennis cham-
pions. The lucky day is
Thursday, the colour purple,
the stone the turquoise.
Were you born between
DEC. 21 and JAN. 19 ?
Then you come under
the tenth sign of the
Zodiac, Capricorn, your
ruling planet is Saturn. You
are not communicative, slow-
ness and caution and pain-
taldngness belong to your
character. You are not too
proud or independent and you
try to be sincere and plain-
spoken. You pride yourself
on keeping your promises,
but you do not like a great
deal of demonstration of af-
fection.
You are serious and perse-
vering, and you can fight all
kinds of difficulties and suc-
ceed in spite of them. At
t'mes, however, you get fits
of depression or discontent.
Try to cultivate hope. You
have great ambition, you are
practical in all your ideas
and plans, and your love of
form and decoration is very
marked. When the outlook is
good, you like to get and
spend, but at the first cloud
on the horizon, you find no
pleasure in cither and be-
come very careful for the
time being.
You would be slow to
marry, but would take kindly
to married life.
You would succeed well in
all occupations that require
care and caution. Good build-
ers and land workers, farm-
ers and contractors are born
in this month, also politic-
ians and business men.
The fortunate day is Sat-
urday, the colour green, and
the stone the onyx.
DO YOU SUFFER FROM
CATARRH?
“Severe attacks of Catarrh
used to keep me awake at
nights,” writes Mrs. N. Sop-
pa of Woondooma Street,
Bundaberg, Q. “My doctor
suggested an operation but I
decided first to give Zam-
Buk a trial. The relief was
wonderful. At the slightest
sign of the trouble now I
simply insert a little of the
balm in the nostrils, iwhale,
and speedily obtain ease.”
