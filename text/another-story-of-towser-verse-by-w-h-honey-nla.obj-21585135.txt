ND Towser then lived the life of a lord until
very restless he grew. One day he resolved, “I
must go abroad, fresh parts of this big world to
view.” The passion for goodness stayed with him
such a very short while, I deplore, and mischievous
thoughts came to him so much and tempted him
more and still more.
One day as he roamed through the garden wide
he found a small hole in the fence. He thought,
“I wonder what can be outside of this hole in
this hedge so dense.” With many sharp yelps,
a scratch on his hide, he sat down and tried hard
to find, just how he could get to the other side
and leave none of his tracks behind.


r
*HE
HE hole was not large and Towser was fat, half
way through his body got stuck. He wriggled
and turned, both this way and that, and he yelped,
“What rotten bad luck.” After much struggling
he squirmed himself free, and rolled clear outside
of the hole. He thought, “Now, hurrah, I’ll go on
a spree, I’ll make a good start with a stroll.”
And so with a yelp, a scratch and a bark—such
freedom he found very sweet —he sauntered along
and met near a park, another dog far down the
street. As he drew closer, this dog, he was sure,
had angered him often before, by barking outside
of his fence, the boor. He thought, “Now I’ll
settle my score.”


n
OW Towser was brave and he knew no fear and
went up to him dog to dog. They each gave a
growl as they both drew near and soon the whole
world was agog. You never have heard such a
noise as they made, which was ended in a loud
bleat of pain from the new found foe, who essayed
a rapid retreat down the street.
Towser then trotted along the broad road for he
cared not whither he went and at last he came to a
queer abode which looked like a very large tent.
He pondered and thought, “Now, what is this
place, I’ve ne’er seen a house just like that’’ and
then he espied a funny round face looking out
from 'neath a high hat.


T"
HE clown
saw the dog and gave him a hail. He
called out, “Good doggie come here.” Towser
with pluck wagged his stump of a tail although in
his heart there was fear. “Yes, you are the dog
I’ve wanted so long to help me perform my star
turn” said the white-faced clown, “To me you
belong.” The voice seemed to Towser so stern.
He took Towser then and gave him some meat
which vanished with speed as it went down Towser’s
long throat, it was very sweet and Towser was
more than content. Towser was artful, a very
cute hound, he wondered “Now, what’s this
about.” He soon was to learn, he very soon found
that once in he could not get out.


r
.** " r \
,HIS very strange man took Towser along to meet
all the rest of the troupe. He met a fat dame, a man
very strong, was then introduced to a group of
folk who all liked our Towser, of course, including
a girl in pink tights, who sprang through a hoop
on the back of a horse and dazzled the crowd
’neath bright lights.
And then the clown spoke, “Come on my young
man and let us commence now to learn. We’ll
make a start now, it’s time you began to know
how to do your great turn.’’ But Towser felt
crushed, refused to be taught, behaved like a
bad stubborn hog. The clown was upset, was
almost distraught as he strove to teach the bad dog.

IE coaxed, gave titbits, used words not a few and
Towser had many a fright. It gradually dawned
what he had to do for the clown on the following
night. Then Towser they took and clipped his
fine coat and robbed him of many a flea, but what
hurt him most, he felt such a goat for like Fido
the Peke looked he.
Oh, why had he crawled through the hole that
morn, forsaking his dear lovely home. He felt
for this job he never was born. Oh, why did he
steal out and roam. And now he looked like that
poor silly fool, like Fido his one mortal foe. If
he could get back to his lovely pool, from home
he’d ne'er again go.

on the next night
he was filled with glee, for
seated across the dark tan were faces that Towser
had longed to see and he grinned just like a dog
can. Yes, there were his master and master’s son
amid the excited gay throng, which screamed with
laughter at all of the fun of the dame and the
man so strong.
Towser then thought “Oh, whate’er shall I do,
how can I let my master know I cannot get out,
I’m in such a stew. Besides I have fallen so low.”
The son at that moment spoke to his dad “Oh,
dad, see that dog over there, that’s Towser I’m
sure. lam very glad. I wish he would come
over here.”


a
ND then with a yelp, like a shot from a gun leapt
Towser across the dark tan into the arms of his
master’s young son and pursued by the big clown
man. And master said, stepping up to the front
“This dog he is mine by the law’’ and Towser
just gave a queer little grunt and gave to his
master his paw.
So Towser they took along to his home away to
his house by the lake. He vowed he would venture
no more to roam, ne’er would he repeat his mistake.
And on the next morn, as he strolled around to all
the old spots that he knew, the hole in the fence
to his joy he found had been closed with nails
stout and true.
