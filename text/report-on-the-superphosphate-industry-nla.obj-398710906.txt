Further reference will be made to the Tariff Board r s report

PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF SUPERPHOSPHATE IN AUSTRALIA.
The past forty years have shown an enormous extension in
the utilisation of superphosphate. The marked deficiency of phosphor-
ic acid in the soil of Australia has been overcome to a certain extent
by the use of superphosphate which is in most cases the best method
cf applying phosphoric acid. Considerable experimental and demon-
stration work, with beneficial results, has been undertaken by the
Departments of Agriculture in the various States and by superphosphate
manufacturers, and farmers are being urged to use more superphosphate
if they desire to obtain the best results, particularly in wheat-
growing and in pasture improvement. Concurrently with the increased
interest in, and demand for, artificial fertilisers, particularly
superphosphate, the productive capacity and output of superphosphate
factories has considerably increased over the past ten years. The
following table shows the production of superphosphate in Australia
from 1925-26 to 1930-3 I inclusive


Factory capacity at the present time amounts to approx-
imately 1,200,000 tons, so that even in the year of maximum output
(1929“-30) the total production was only approximately three-fourths
of total capacity. The most striking feature of Table 11. is the
decline of nearly 30 per cent in output for 1930-31. This was due
to low prices for primary products and to general financial stringency.
Obviously the reduction in output must have seriously affected produc-
tion costs.
On the basis of phosphate rock used in 1931-32 there appears
to have been a slight increase in output of superphosphate in that
year, but the figure would still be under 700,000 tons.
Figures showing the actual quantity of superphosphate used
in each year are not readily available, but according to Commonwealth
statistical publications the quantity of artificial fertiliser used in
Australia increased from 488,c01 tons in 1923-24 to 852,925 tons in
1929-30. Most of the artificial fertiliser used in Australia is
superphosphate.
In the same period the area manured with artificial
fertilisers increased from 12,000,000 to nearly 20,000,000 acres.
Victoria and Western Australia now use over 200,000 tons
of artificial manure per annum each, while South Australia uses
just on 200,000 tons. Consumption in New South Wales falls far
short of that in the three first-mentioned States, while Tasmania
and Queensland use only between 20,000 and 30,000 tons per annum
each. Most of the artificial manure used in Queensland would be
other than superphosphate, which would amount to only about 5,000
tons per year for the State.
IMPORTANCE OF SUPERPHOSPHATE TO AUSTRALIAN PRIMARY PRODUCTION.
The importance of superphosphate in the economic develop-
ment of Australia can scarcely be over-estimated. Upon its wide and
continuous use depends the profitable exploitation of the greater
portion of our farm lands, and a not inconsiderable section of our
pastoral areas. Inasmuch as the progress made by the wheat industry
during the last forty years largely depended on the application tc
the soil of phosphatic fertilisers so will the future expansion to a
great extent depend on similar practice.
All the evidence available points to a greater annual
demand for this fertiliser in the future than in the past, and although
no satisfactory estimate of the probable requirements can be made it
is unquestionable that, as the practice of agriculture extends in
Australia, greater reliance will be placed on the benefits to be won
by the use of phosphatic dressings. It is sometimes questioned, on
account of the recent increase in the world’s production, whether the
trend of the wheat industry in Australia will not be towards the re-
striction rather than the expansion of the acreage under cultivation.
The probabilities are that Australia will continue to be an important
competitor in the world’s market and there appears to be no valid
reason for the fear that keenly competitive prices will affect the
industry In Australia more seriously than in other exporting countries.
In Australia the technique of wheatgrowing can, to a considerable
extent, be improved, and the increased use of superphosphate will be
one of the important factors in maintaining the strong position of the
industry. Generally speaking, the heavier rainfall areas can profit-
ably utilise heavier dressings, but the opinion of agricultural
scientists, based on experimental and field data, is that the maximum
economic rate of application has not yet been reached.


Professor A.' J. Perkins, Director of Agriculture of South
Australia, in giving evidence before the Tariff Board, stated that
it was difficult to give reliable figures representing the mean
effectiveness of superphosphate for the whole of that State.
Carefully controlled experiments, scattered all over the State, and
extending over many years, gave the following general percentage
increases above unmanured crops
J cwt. superphosphate per acre - increase of 33*1 per cent.
1 ii it it it it it 45.6 " "
2 cwts. " " " 11 " 60.9 11 "
n 11 11 11 11 11 64.8 " 11
The farmer r s ability to make use of heavy dressings depends on -
(1) the price of superphosphate, and
(2) the value of the increase secured.
These factors are in turn governed by the current price of wheat.
Within recent years in South Australia the mean dressing
of superphosphate per acre has been about 90 lbs. per acre. The
annual •average production was about 12J bushels of wheat per acre
whereas, without superphosphate, the mean State yield would have
been about 8J bushels per acre.
If, however, an average application of 2 cwts. of super-
phosphate had been applied, the State average over the same period
would have been about 14i bushels per acre. Thus, with wheat and
superphosphate at their present prices, an expenditure of say 10/-
per acre (including freight) for superphosphate, plus the eost of
putting it on, would give an increased return of 6 bushels of wheat
at, say, 3/- per bushel at the siding, a gain of approximately 8/-
per acre, less cost of harvesting, bagging and carting.
Interesting figures were given by Mr. G. L. Sutton, Director
of Agriculture, Western Australia, at the Tariff Board Enquiry.
Wheatgrowing, he said, was practically impossible in that State unless
superphosphate was used. Only a few years ago, 70 lbs. per acre was
considered to be an ample dressing, but recent experience had amply
demonstrated that this quantity could be profitably increased.
Up-to-date farmers now used from 100 to 150 lbs. per acre, and even
larger amounts than those. Experimental data showed that in some
districts 150 lbs. per acre was the most economic application. Even
in light rainfall districts in that State.heavy applications have been
found profitable. At Yilgarn, for instance, where the average annual
rainfall is as low as 10.41 inches, an application of 75 lbs. per acre
gave a yield of 21 bushels 33 l"bs,, whereas by using 150 lbs. of super-
phosphate the yield was 24 bushels 43 lbs.
Departmental experts in New South Wales and in Victoria are
definitely of opinion that the optimum amount of superphosphate per
acre in those States has not yet been reached. Under normal condi-
tions the aggregate quantity that could profitably be used could be
largely increased. The trend of farm practice is towards the
utilisation of increasing quantities. The factors which must
inevitably operate to bring about an increase are :-
(1) Improved methods of fallowing which, by increasing the
moisture content of the soil, will enable the absorption
of more fertiliser; and
(2) Continued cropping must tend to deplete the inherent
fertility of the soil and so compel heavier applications.


These factors are, of course, common to all the Australian
wheat lands where an insufficiency of available phosphoric acid exists.
The topdressing of pastures provides another highly important
avenue for the free utilisation of superphosphate. In the south-west
of Western Australia there are large areas of grazing country which
have been rendered, profitable solely on account of the availability
of superphosphate, and without its use the land, instead of carrying
xlocks and herds, would revert to a state of nature. Relatively ooor—
class country has been given a real and substantial value by the
establishment of good pastures. The Western Australian Department of
Agriculture estimates that within the next few years the State's
requirements will amount to at least 500,000 tons'of superphosphate
per year. At the present time it is less than half that amount *
In the south-east of South Australis, land which only a. few years ago
was regardedas too poor and hungry to be worthy of, or susceptible to
improvement is gradually being brought under occupation. Phosphoric *
acid, applied in_ different forms, has been the touchstone which has
brought about this transformation. Similarly, in Victoria added
value has been given to inferior land, and highly fertile land has
been made to yield unexpectedly high returns because of its response
to sound manurial treatment.
In New South Wales it is now found that, in addition to the
coastal divisions of the State, profitable response is shown by the
soils in the central and southern tablelands, the central western
slopes, the south-west slopes, and eastern Riverina. The agros-
tologist of that State has made the prediction that within the near
future the quantity of superphosphate used on pastures will exceed
the amount at present applied to crop nroduction. The use of super-
phosphate has been temporarily arrested by the crushing fall in the
price of primary products, notably wheat, wool and fat“lambs. The
- arming community after the 1930-31 harvest became so impoverished
expenditure on so vital an item as superphosphate had perforce
to be restricted. In respect of wool and fat lambs, prices also
fell to unprofitable levels and while this position remains the
economics of the topdressing of pastures is seriously affected.
Many graziers, under the depressed economic conditions, have asked
themselves why they should increase their pasturage when it cannot
be profitably converted into mutton or wool.
The economics of the use of fertilisers is so closely
affected by commodity prices that a check to the consumption of
fertilisers is inevitable when price levels are depressed. The
decrease in the demand for superphosphate during the last year or
two has been brought aibout solely by the low prices obtainable for
agricultural products. It is certain that when a., return to the
normal is effected there will be an enormous increase in the demand
for superphosphate, and tha.t as the area devoted to agriculture is
j-noreased, _ and as the technique of f arming is improved, this demand
will be still further strengthened.
WORLD PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION.
Reduced consumption of superphosphate has not been confined
to Australia. World production in 1930 was estimated at 15,300,000
tons but it is estimated that the 1931 figures when available will be
considerably less. European consumption was estimated at 8,691,000
tons in 1929 and 7,515.000 tons in 1930, whilst for 1931 it has been
estimated in trade journals that the consumption will amount to about
h ,000,000 tons. Many European works arc closed and reduced output is
reported for 1931, particularly in Eastern Europe and in Italy.
Detailed world production and consumption figures are not
available but deliveries of phosphate rock (the main constituent of


superphosphate) form an excellent guide to the position. Independent
estimates by two leading oversea firms indicate the following trend
in world shipments from 1926-1931 :-

EXTENT AND AVAILABILITY OF SUPPLIES.
In the manufacture of one ton of superphosphate approxi-
mately 57 per cent phosphate rock and 37 P er cent sulphuric acid are
used. The extent and availability of supplies of superphosphate are
therefore dependent upon the position in regard to phosphate rock
and sulphuric acid.
PHOSPHATE ROCK.
The British Phosphate Commissioners, representing the
British, Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments, control the pro-
duction and sale of phosphate rock from Nauru and Ocean Islands.
Briefly, the control of these deposits is vested in the
Commissioners by virtue of an agreement between the Governments of
the United Kingdom, Australia and No?/ Zealand. The agreement pro-
vides that the output from the islands is to be distributed between
the signatory countries in the following proportions
United Kingdom . . 4'2 per cent
Australia . . 42 " 11
New Zealand . . 16 11 "
* 100 " "
and that, if in any year, any one of the three countries does not
require any-portion of its quota, such portion may be divided pro
rata betw r een the other two. The United Kingdom has not taken any
rock from Nauru and Ocean Island since 1921, mainly owing to the
high freight charges from the Islands to the United Kingdom. Since
1925 Australia and New Zealand have taken the whole of the output
from the Islands.
For some years Australia's requirements of superphosphate
have necessitated the importation of phosphate rock from other
sources in addition to that obtained from Nauru and Ocean Islands.
There has been a considerable decline in these other imports recently
owing to the decrease in manufacture and consumption of superphosphate
in 1930-31 1931~32* The following table shows the disposal of
the output from the Islands from 1928-29 to 1931~32, the estimated
output for 1932-33 and the imports of rock other than from Nauru
and Ocean Islands into Australia for those years

TABLE IV.
A programme of development work is now in hand to increase
the output capacity of the islands to approximately 1,000 000 tors
per annum by 1935-
The estimates of tonnage of phosphate rock remaining or the
islands are revised each year at 30th June. The estimates at 30th
June, 193T> were J
.. 89,700,000 tons
Ocean Island .. 13,130,000 "
Total .. 104,830,000 "
The average output for the years 1928-29 to 1932-33 is csti-
mated at less than 300,000 tons per annum. Even if the output capaci-
ty be increased to 1,000,000 tons per annum as now proposed, there is
no reason for anticipating any shortage of rock for many years.
would appear, however, that if the consumption of super-
phosphate in Australia is appreciably increased during the next few
3 it will still be necessary to purchase some portion of our re-
quirements from other sources, despite the proposed increase in the
output capacity of Nauru and Ocean Islands. Both the Tariff Board
? eneral Manp -g° r cf the British Phosphate Commission estimated
in 1y29 that there would be an annual increase of in Australian
consumption of phosphate rock. On this basis the Tariff Board esti-
mated that by 1933, assuming a progressive increase in output of rock
U P t 0 000,000 tons per annum and no demand for Nauru and Ocean
Islands rock from the United Kingdom, Australia would be importing from
other sources about 19 per cent of her requirements.
In making this calculation the estimated Australian con-
sumption of rock in 1935 was put down at 894,000 tons, equivalent to
approximately 1,490,000 tons of superphosphate.
ActraJly, the position so fa.r ha.s not been as estimated by
,he Board and there has been a decline in consumption. This however
is only a temporary phase. Owing to lack of funds, many farmers ard '
orchardists have refrained from putting on any dressing of superphos-
phate or have reduced their dressing considerably during the past two
or three years. With a return to normal economic conditions there
is bound to be an immediate increase in the use of superphosphate and
consequently in the demand for phosphate rock.

'" AND ACTUAL CONSUMPTION 1928-29 to
So many factors may affect Australia’s primary industries during
the next few years that it is not practice,blc nor desirable to
endeavour to forecast future requirements. Should there be an
improvement in economic conditions of primary industries, consumption
should rapiqiy recover and with the continuous departmental propaganda
should show a progressive increase.
PRICES OF PHOSPHATE ROCK.
Under the terms of the agreement covering the Nauru and
Ocean Island deposits, the price charged to manufacturers for rock
from those islands is based on cost of production plus sinking fund
n nd other charges and interest at 6 per cent per annum. In fixing
the prices to Australian manufacturers freights are pooled and the
same c.i.f. price is charged at all Australian ports. When it is
necessary to purchase rock from other sources, this is done by the
British Phosphate Commissioners. The c.i.f, price of rock from
other sources is higher than that from Nauru Pnd Ocean Island. The
Commission does not collect from manufacturers the actual cost per
ton of each cargo of such phosphate, but, in order to maintain a
known and steady average price to all manufacturers, collects a, small
surcharge per ton on Nauru pnd Ocean Island phospha.te, and charges
the other rock to manufacturers at the mean price of Nauru/Ocean rock.

The British Phosphate Commission calculates the following
actual average cost per ton of all phosphate rock, after allowing
for carryovers, for the years 1928-29 to 1932-33 :-

The Commission allows 6 months' credit for 17/6d. of the
price of the rock when application is made by the manufacturers and
approved.
Since 1929-30, when the average cost fell about 2/ld. per
ton, there have been only slight variations in cost of rock to
manufacturers. A variation of l/~ per ton in rock would represent
about 7d. per ton of superphosphate.
It is of interest to observe that the proportion of the
c.i.f. price represented by freight and charges has varied from
40 per cent to 50 per cent in recent years. The following table
shows the range

* Estimate.
Freight charges from Nauru and Ocean Islands are heavy on account
of the difficulties in loading caused by adverse weather conditions
at the islands and the lack of back loading or other opportunities
of trade.
Since the Nauru-Ocean phosphate undertaking has been under
the control of the Commission, prices charged to Australian
manufacturers have been brought considerably below the open market
rate for high grade phosphate. Further reductions are largely
dependent on increased output the development work now in hand
will increase the output to 1,000,000 tons per annum, but
actual output will be liable to some fluctuation according to
weather conditions at the islands.
During the last 3 years, grabs have been introduced by
the Commission at_ Australian ports and as a result the cost of
discharging rock in Australia has been substantially reduced.
The following table compares the prices c.i.f. & e. at
Australian ports of ea.ch kind of phosphate
TABLE VIII.
COST OF PHOSPHATE, C.I.F. & E.
This table shows that the Nauru and Ocean Island rock
is of the highest quality as regards percentage of
phosphate of lime and that it is much cheaper per unit than
other high grade rock.
In the course of discussions as to the price of super-
phosphate it has been represented that some relief might be given
to purchasers if a reduction were made in the interest and
sinking fund charges on the capital invested in N n uru and Ocean
Island. In this connection the following table, showing the

Thus, if the output from the islands were 700,000 tons, a
reduction in the interest ra.te from 6 per cent to 4 per cent would
mean a reduction of only l/6d. per ton of rock, or, approximately,
lOd. per ton of superphosphate. if the whole of the interest and
sinking fund charge Pased on a rate of 6 per cent were cancelled,
the saving per ton of rock would be 6/4d. (based on 700,000 tons
output), equivalent to approximately 3/9d* per ton of superphosphate.
When the output rea,ches 1,000,000 tons as anticipated in 1935* the
corresponding reductions would be l/~ per ton of rock or 7d. per ton
of superphosphate for a reduction of interest to 4 per cent and
4/sd. Per ton of rock or 2/Bd. per ton of superphosphate if all
interest were wiped out. These estimated reductions when applied
on the basis of, say, 1 cwt. of superphosphate per acre would be
negligible, except in the aggregate saving to a farmer using a very
large quantity of fertiliser.

SULPHURIC ACID
In Australia the sulphuric acid used in the manufacture of
superphosphate is obtained principally from imported brimstone sul-
phur. Some idea as to the extent to which sulphur, in the form of
sulphuric acid, is utilised in the production of fertilisers within
the Commonwealth may be gathered from the fact that approximately
Qjfo of the total sulphur imports during the five years ended 1930/31?
together with the sulphur equivalent of the sulphuric acid produced
in Australia from zinc concentrates for the same period, was consumed
in the breaking down of phosphate rock for superphosphates.
WORLD'S TRADE IN SULPHUR.
In considering the economic aspects of either the produc-
tion or consumption of sulphur within the Commonwealth, regard must
be had to world reserves and resources.
The following table, taken from statistics appearing in a
recent publication "The Mineral Industry of the British Empire and
Foreign Countries", issued by the Imperial Institute, shows the
principal sulphur-producing, exporting and importing countries of
the world for the years 1928, 1929 and 1930 > respectively

Whilst dealing with the question of production of sulphur
within Australia, regard must be had to the possibilities of sub-
stituting pyrites for sulphur in the manufacture of sulphuric acid.
In all the chief industrial countries of the world, par-
ticularly the Continental countries, large quantities of iron-pyrites
are mined or imported annually for the purpose of sulphuric acid
manufacture - for example, in England until recently sulphur had
been almost entirely replaced by pyrites for such purposes.
The commercial value of pyrites depends chiefly upon the
quantity of available sulphur and copper it contains, the ease with
which the sulphur can be recovered, and the position of the deposits
as regards cheap mining and transport facilities. Fairly large
deposits of pyrites are known to occur in various parts of the
Commonwealth, particularly in Tasmania and New South Wales, but in
the past, owing to the relatively high cost of production of the raw
material and the high initial cost of installing roasters for
treatment purposes, the use of this ore in the manufacture of
sulphuric acid has been found to be uneconomic in competition with
sulphur at a landed cost of about £6 per ton or lower.
Extensive deposits in Western Australia were worked for
some years prior to 1922, but transport costs and the inaccessibility
of the deposits have caused them to be relinquished in favour of
imported sulphur.
In view of the recent increase in landed cost of sulphur,
due principally to the incidence of exchange, definite attempts are
being made to substitute pyrites for brimstone sulphur in the manu-
facture of sulphuric acid. In recent years the production of
sulphuric acid from Australian minerals has been almost entirely
from zinc concentrates.

AUSTRALIA'S SULPHUR REQUIREMENTS
The total quantity and value of Australia's production of sulphur
(irom zinc concentrates) and imports during the five years ended
1930/3I have been as follow
TABLE XIII.
SULPHUR - AUSTRALIA - 1926/27-1930/31
As already stated, the principal use for sulphur in the form of
sulphuric acid in Australia is in the manufacture of fertilisers,
particularly superphosphates. The following table shows the total
production of superphosphates and the relative sulphur content
thereof during the five years ended 1930/31
TABLE XIV.
SUPERPHOSPHATES - PRODUCTION - 1926/27-1930/31


Although economic considerations have forced the farmers
to reduce_ temporarily their use of superphosphates as a fertiliser,
the restricted use of this fertiliser as a dressing cannot be
continued indefinitely.
It may be reasonably assumed, therefore, that under
normal conditions Australia's future rcquiremehts of sulphur will
range from 100,000 to 125,000 tons annually, with a tendency to
increase.
PRICE OF SULPHUR
From Australia's point of view the present high landed
cost of sulphur, and the fact that America has a practical
monopoly of the world's supply of this commodity at present,
makes it most desirable to obtain sulphur supplies locally,either
as native sulphur or in a form such as pyrites or zinc concen-
trates.
The landed cost of sulphur has an important bearing on
the cost of manufacture of superphosphate. It takes approximate-
ly one ton of sulphur to produce 9 tons of superphosphate.
Wljen the Tariff Board presented its report in 1929, the
average landed cost of sulphur, in store, Melbourne, was from £6
to £6/6/- per ton. For the years 1929/30 and 1930/31 the average
landed cost Melbourne was in the vicinity of £6/6/- per ton.
1n^1931/32 there was a definite increase in landed cost, mainly
owing to the incidence of exchange, and the landed price went as
high as £B/15/- per ton. The average for the year would be
approximately £7/10/- per ton, or something over £1 greater than
in the three preceding years. An increase of £1 per ton in the
cost of sulphur represents an increase of approximately 2/3d per
ton in the cost of manufacture of superphosphate.
When the price of brimstone sulphur is high,the tendency
is to consider other means of obtaining sulphuric acid. Recently
very careful thought has been given to the possibility of obtain-
ing sulphur fromppyrites for production of sulphuric acid. Zinc
concentrates have been used for some years and at present up to
30$ of the sulphuric acid used in manufacture of superphosphate
is derived from zinc concentrates.
Before undertaking the use of any substitutes for brim-
stone sulphur, very full information on the following points is
essential
(1) Nature and cost of plant necessary for extraction of
sulphur from pyrites or zinc concentrates.
(2) P r ice per ton of substitute raw material and charges
from point of supply to plant where used.
(3) Total cost per ton of 100$ sulphuric acid made from
(a) Brimstone sulphur at present prices.
(b) Zinc concentrates.
(c) Pyrites.
(4) Possibility of a fall in price of brimstone sulphur
after additional expensive plant is installed.
It does not appear likely that there will be any exten-
sion of production of sulphuric acid from zinc concentrates, but
the probable use of pyrites is being explored. There are two
sources of supply of pyrites - foreign and local. The following
figures prepared in regard to foreign imports show the very small
estimated margin that would exist between foreign pyrites and

TABLE XV.
Estimated cost of sulphur content of Foreign
Pyrites in Western Australia based on present
price of Pyrites f.o.b. Spanish port and
exchange of 25 per cent.
The present price of sulphur landed in store would be
approximately £7/10/- per ton, so that there is a margin of
probably £l/16/- per ton in favour of foreign pyrites if no
duty be payable. Extra cost would , of course, be incurred for
installation of roasting plant for recovery of sulphur, and the
interest and depreciation thereon, as well as any extra labour
or additional raw materials, would have to be added to the
£5/14/5 per ton shown above, and would probably bring the cost
of sulphur from pyrites up to £6/10/- per ton.
In making these calculations the pyrites have been
regarded as admitted duty free, although actually the duty at
present is £l/p/- per ton. The duty was not added to the
landed cost as it was desired to ascertain just how the present
position would compare with that operating in 1929 > when the
Tariff Board recommended that the duty on pyrites be removed in
order to enable Western Australian manufacturers to use them in
preference to brimstone sulphur.
Even with brimstone sulphur at its present high price,
it appears doubtful whether any advantage would accrue from
using foreign pyrites in Western Australia, The removal of the
duty as recommended by the Tariff Board in 1929 would probably
help, but the incidence of exchange and the doubt as to the con-
tinuance of present sulphur prices are not likely to encourage
local manufacturers to instal expensive plants for treating
foreign pyrites.
As regards local pyrites, a great deal of information
is available in the Mines Departments of the respective States
showing location of deposits, probable reserves, and quality of
ore, but no definite information is obtainable in respect of
costs, Tasmanian and New South Wales pyrites certainly present
distinct possibilities, but the deposits in other States do not
appear to have been extensively worked, and information in regard


to their economics is not readily obtainable. One Company which
used fairly extensive quantities of pyrites from Tasmania found
that the cost in terms of sulphur at that time went up to as high
as £8 per ton. Such information as is available in regard to
Australian pyrites is contained in a brief summary of Mines Depart-
ment reports attached hereto. Certain Australian Companies are
definitely exploring the possibility of using local pyrites for manu-
facture of sulphuric acid. It must be remembered that if manu-
factured from local minerals the sulphur content of the sulphuric
acid produced is eligible for the sulphur bounty of £2/5/- per ton
(less 20 per cent).
The present time may be regarded as distinctly favourable
for trying local pyrites,and it is likely that some saving in cost
of sulphuric acid, with a consequent saving in cost of superphos-
phate, might thus be attained.
COSTS OF PRODUCTION OF SUPERPHOSPHATE
Each of the Companies manufacturing superphosphate in
Australia has submitted, in confidence, its manufacturing and dis-
tributing costs for the year 1930/31* In some instances figures
for 1931/32 have also been supplied. Particulars of output
■capacity and actual output for 1930/31 have also been made available
In considering costs of production, the items fall
definitely into three sections, viz.-
(i) Raw materials.
(ii) Manufacture, dressing and despatch.
(iii) General overhead, selling and distribution.
(i) Raw Materials -
Raw material costs are fairly easily ascertained although
each Company shows slight variations in the cost of these per ton
of superphosphate. These differences would be accounted for by
slight variations in quality of rock, by the distance of each
factory from the wharf where materials are discharged, by different
wharfage rates and, possibly, by different methods of manufacture.
A weighted average cost should, however, give a fair indication of
the cost. Output compared with capacity would also have some
effect, but not an extensive one, on the costs of rock, sulphur and
other materials per ton of superphosphate. Accumulation of stocks
of raw material on account of declining output might react favour-
ably or unfavourably on costs according to the trend of prices.
The principal raw materials used are phosphate rock and
sulphur. The cost of rock and sulphuric acid represents nearly
90$ of the total cost of a ton of dump superphosphate. The
importance of fluctuations in prices of these commodities cannot
therefore be over-estimated.
In order to give some idea of the cost of rock and sulphur
per ton of superphosphate, a weighted average has been calculated,
based on the figures supplied by a representative number of manu-
facturers in the mainland producing States. The following are' the
figures :-

GENERAL COMMENTS ON COSTS -
In view of the preponderance of phosphate rock and sulphur
in superphosphate costs, there is not much to add to what has been
said under those headings. It is worthy of note, however, that any
Denefits from reductions in wages or interest charges do not affect
superphosphate costs to any great extent, as wages in Australia form
only about 8% of the total cost and the cost of the major items
(rock and sulphur) has been unchanged or has increased during the
past three years.
There is one item in respect of which some comment might
De made, viz. wharfage charges in Victoria. At Melbourne and
Geelong wharfage on sulphur imported is 5/- per ton and on phosphate
rock 2/bd per ton. The rates in the various States are
If the Melbourne rates were the same as for Sydney, this
would mean reductions, amounting to l/5d per ton, in the cost of
superphosphate manufacture in Victoria, while there would also be
small reductions in cost of manufacture in other States if the
charges there were the same as in Sydney. Although the saving per
ton would not be great, it would be something worth passing on in
most States.
Another item which might possibly be reduced is general
overhead and depreciation. These charges, which must be incurred
irrespective of output, have naturally been greater per ton with the
reduced demand for superphosphate recently. Owing to the restricted
selling season and the need for carrying reserves of phosphate rock
equivalent to 25% of normal annual requirements, the capital cost of
storage buildings is high in relation to present output.
Consequently overhead charges on this account at present are higher
than normal. "When it is considered, however, that present output
is only approximately 50% of total capacity, it must be obvious that
some reduction in overhead and administrative expenditure could be
. e ~ e " i ou tpnt were increased. Further, the increased out-
p t from Nauru and Ocean Islands would also result in a reduction in
.osts of raw materials, so that an increase in demand would be of
benefit to all concerned and particularly to consumers.


It is not suggested that reduction of costs by stimulation of
demand is an easy matter, but it is well worthy of consideration.
SUMMARY OF COSTS AND COMPARISON WITH
SELLING PRICE.
The total of items (i) and. (ii) under the heading "Costs
of Production" is which, when compared with present
selling prices, leaves 17/- of the cash price of £4/16/-, and
£l/2/*- of the terms price of £4/15/- to cover selling costs,
administrative costs and other overhead charges, and to provide
the manufacturers' profit.
The varying costs under paragraph (iii) are such as to
render a definite comparison practically impossible, but it may
be estimated that under present conditions the manufacturers'
profit would range from 4/- to 7/- per ton according to the out-
put, proportion of cash to terms business, agency arrangements
and bad debts charged.
Even assuming 7/“ per ton profit, a,nd some manufacturers
do not make anything approaching this figure at present, the
preponderance of overhead and other varying costs per ton is
evident while output is at the present low figure. The present
profits cannot be regarded as providing any margin for reduction
in price, but there is every reason to believe that if full
output or something approaching it could be reached this would
permit of a price reduction of up to 5/~ P er "t° n > and at the same
time give manufacturers a reasonable return on capital invested
in plant, machinery and stocks. This estimate is supported by
figures which have been supplied confidentially by manuiacturcrs.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION.
The Tariff Board in its report referred to the variety of
methods of marketing superphosphate in Australia and to the
disinclination of most farmers to act for themselves. In the
opinion of the Board many of the services rendered by agents could,
have been quite easily performed by the farmers themselves and,
in ±act, in many cases such services were being rendered only to
a few although paid for by all. The recommendation was that the
agency^charge for soliciting and booking orders and generally
replacing travellers should be 2/6d. per ton and that any other
services, such as receiving and storing superphosphate and accep-
tance of financial risk, should be paid for only by those farmers
who desired such service.
Since that report was made most Companies have offered
facilities and special low prices to those farmers who desire to
deal direct. Farmers generally, however, have failed to take
advantage of this opportunity, a major reason no doubt being
shortage of funds owing to the low prices of primary products in
the past or three yearns. The year has, however, shown
an increase in direct business with some Companies, The special
terms were generally for cash with order direct. The Companies
consider that the small number taking advantage of the special
terms for cash with order direct is evidence of the necessity for
agents. It would be more desirable, however, to form conclusions
on this aspect after two or three years of good prices rather than
after a period of depression.
Other directions in which the Companies are endeavouring to
help reduce the farmers’ expenditure on superphosphate are by
granting concessions for la,rge quantities, by making allowances
where the farmer returns his bags for refilling and where delivery
is taken before a certain date, e.g,, before the end of February.-,
In some States, concessions in railway freight are also granted
if delivery is taken in the early part of the year,
The following examples have been submitted by a. South
Australian manufacturer indicating the savings which can be
effected by farmers who take advantage of all the concessions
offering in that State

ihus, by taking advantage of the various concessions avail—
able, a farmer may save up to 12/9d, per ton of superphosphate.
It is thought that these two tables illustrate the position more
clearly than if each particular item were set out separately.
Similar concessions apply in most States except where special
local conditions prevent their application as, for example, in
the use of secondhand sacks.
Although it is possible for farmers to make fairly extensive
savings in the directions indicated, the Companies report that a
large percentage does not take full advantage of the concessions,
T-iis may, of course, be due to special circumstances or to the
armer s lack of ready money. For example, empty superphosphate
bags are of some use on the farm and will be more useful as
for bulk handling of wheat are extended. Some manufac-
turers, while making the concession of 5/“ per ton for secondhand
oags, do not favour the practice on account of the extra trouble
involved at the factory. The allowance is more likely to appeal
to the large user of superphosphate, who can take his supply in
a n umoer of small lots, returning the bags each time while they
are still in good condition.
So far as the other concessions are concerned, these are
not general, but where available are usually taken,
While dealing with distribution of superphosphate, it is
worthy of mention that there has been some reduction in agents*
commissions since the Tariff Board report, but not in all cases to
extent suggested by the Board, The main reductions have been
tne excision by some Companies of over-riding commission whether
. e order is booked by the agent or not and, in some cases, a
reduction in the actual rates. The same position still applies
in regard to agents 1 responsibilities, i.e, their functions may
be broadly divided under the following headings
(a) Booking orders and reporting on customers.
(0) Receipt, delivery and storage of superphosphate at
country centres,
(c) Acceptance of financial risk on credit accounts,
7 is suggested that agents should not be paid a
reasonable commission for the services they render to farmers, but
it is considered that only those farmers who require such services
should pay for them,
As some Companies have reduced agents* commission to the
igure suggesced by the Tariff Board, there appears to be no reason
why chic procedure should not be generally adopted, and, in fact,
tnis is desirable. To be effective, all Companies must agree to


a decrease, as otherwise the Company which makes a reduction may
find its agents transferring to other Companies,
REDUCED PRICE FOR LARGE QUANTITIES.
Most Companies quote a reduction of from 2/6d. per ton up
to as high as 7/6b. per ton, where large quantities, ranging
upwards from 50 tons, are purchased. There appears to be scope
here for local groups of farmers buying a large quantity for cash
and thus obtaining -
(a) Cash Discount,
(b) Special Quantity Discount.
(c) Agent’s Commission.
These three items combined would probably average 10/- per
ton. Certain butter factories (co-operative and proprietary)
are buying superphosphate today in Victoria at a special cash price
of £4/2/- per ton, f.o.r. Melbourne, and selling to their suppliers
on terms at a price well below the terms price quoted to individual
farmers for small quantities. No a.gent' s commission is payable
on this business. Movements such as these will help farmers to
obtain some reduction in their outgoings for superphosphate. Even
though a few shillings per ton mean very little per acre, all savings
of this kind are helpful in the aggregate, and it would be of
aefinite advantage to cash buyers in a district to get together for
the purpose of obtaining these concessions.
VARIATION IN PRICE OF SUPPERPHOSPHATE
IN AUSTRALIA SINCE 1913/14
It is of interest to record that in 1913/14 when the price
of rock was approximately £2/7/6 per ton, of sulphur £4/18/6 per
ton, and of bags 6/7d. per dozen, the list price of 17$ water soluble
superphosphate was £4/7/6 per ton. Just after the war, the price of
raw materials increased considerably, and the price of 17$ super-
phosphate went up to £6/3/- per ton. In with rock costing
an average of £2/5/10 per ton, c.i,f,,*and sulphur averaging £7/10/-
per ton, landed in store, Melbourne, and with bags at an average
?rice of 9/ per dozen, the list price of superphosphate
(20.5% water soluble) is £4/15/- per ton for terms, and £4/IC/- per
uon lor cash. The price of £4/10/ for 20,5$ water soluble is
equivalent to £3/14/8 per ton of 17$ water soluble. In 1913/14 there
was no difference between terms and cash prices.
The figures indicate that although there has been an
increase in the cost of raw materials (excepting phosphate rock)
since 1913/14? ihe price of superphosphate to the farmer has
decreased by 14,75.
PRICES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.
x n Although some information regarding prices in other countries
nas oeen obtained from Trade Journals, comparison with Australian
prices is of no significance without definite knowledge, which is
not rea.dily obtainable, as to costs of raw materials, freights, work-
ing conditions and selling terms in each country. For the first
quarter of the current year the price to the Australian farmer, per
unit of water soluble phosphoric acid, has been as high as, and in
some cases higher than, in any other country for which figures are
available. Germany and France are the only countries where the
price approximates that in Australia, viz, 4/4d, per unit on cash
sales and 4/7sd, per unit on terms.


It is considered desirable ; however, to make some comparison
with conditions in New Zealand, which is the only country standard-
ising on superphosphate of the same high grade as used in Australia,
In 1931 the New Zealand Government agreed to pay to manufacturers
a subsidy of 11/- per ton on superphosphate, equivalent to Australian.
22grade, delivered by them from their works. The manufacturers,
on their part, agreed to reduce the price to the farmer by a further
6/6d. per ton, making the cash selling price £.3/17/8 net l° n free on
rails. Subsequently the price of sulphur advanced, and the Govern-
ment authorised the manufacturers to increase their prices by 3/" per
ton, making the price £4/2/6 per ton. In July, the Government
subsidy was reduced to 8/lOd. per ton, and the manufacturers reduced
the ca.sh selling price to £A per ton, so that they now receive
£4/8/10.
The Government subsidy applies to superphosphate for all
branches of agriculture.
Besides granting the subsidy, the Government, some years ago -
granted concessions in railway freights on artificial manures. These
are referred to under transport costs, page 29.
If the Government subsidy of 8/lOd, per ton be added to
the present ca.sh price of superphosphate in New Zealand, the actual
price received by the New Zealand manufacturer is £4/8/10 per tor-
compared with £4?10/- for cash in Australia, The prices relate
to the came grade of superphosphate and as both Dominions obtain
their raw materials from the same sources, they present a more suit-
able basic for comparison than the prices obtaining in other countries.
It is of interest to consider what effect, if any, the New
Zealand subsidy has had on superphosphate. In the New Zealand
Journal of Agriculture for May,1932, summaries of comparative import
statistics of fertilisers are set out. These summaries give
details of the prepared fertilisers and materials for fertiliser
manufacture entering the Dominion during the year ended Jlst March,
1932* The returns exhibit a. reduction in tonnage in almost all
items, although phosphate rock imported from Nauru and Ocean Island
shows an improvement of 28,582 tons, or 24$ over the previous years
quot n ,
In commenting upon the tables the Journal states that,
undoubtedly, the stimulus to domestic consumption of high grade
superphosphate oco n sioned by the State subsidy, has considerably
influenced the import position of basic slag and other commodities
in the phosphate class.
It is too early yet to say whether the improvement in the
position as regards high grade superphosphate will be maintained,
nor c°n it be said definitely that this is entirely due to the
subsidy. The indications are, however, that the demand for super-
phosphate in 1932/33 arill be maintained and will probably exceed that
of the previous year.
CREDIT BUSINESS - BAD DEBTS.
Although nil Companies do not follow the samo colling procedure,
the extensive credit bucinecs in superphosphate over the past few
years has caused a very large accumulation of Book Debts, The
position has been intensified by farmers’ lack of ready money on
account of the low prices for many primary products* A summary of
debtors’ accounts at 30th June, 1931* indicated that approximately
£2,000,000 was owing to fertiliser manufacturers at that date,
sums have been written off as bad and further writing off is
anticipated in many Companies, The tot°l amount owing had been

considerably reduced by 30/6/32 but, ell bclcnoc sheets *re
not yet available, accurate estimate cannot be made. Some pro-
vision has to be made in costing for bad debts, and/or anticipated
bad debts, as well as for cost of collection of outstanding accounts.
If agents accept responsibility for collection of accounts their
commission is naturally higher than if they merely book orders. No
doubt the sales policy will be considerably revised in future with
a view to restricting credit as far .as possible, but .heavy losses
will probably be made on debts incurred prior to such restriction.
Even though the incidence of Bad Debts has not been reflected
in an increase in price of superphosphate, the position must be most
unsatisfactory from the point of view of both manufacturers and cash
purchasers. No doubt the profits of the manufacturers will be
seriously affected, while the cash purchaser will continue to feel,
despite all protest rations to the contrary, that he is helping to pay
for some of these losses.
This is a factor which affects agency charges, to which reference
was made by the Tariff Board, and also has a bearing on output as com-
pared with factory capacity. Agent's commission could probably be
readily reduced to the figure suggested by the Tariff Board, if all
Companies acted in unison and if credit business and consequent
del credere risk were reduced to a minimum. On the other hand,
restriction of credit will probably entail continued loader output as
compared with factory capacity. The only alternative appears to be
to seek some method, satisfactory to all parties, for reducing the
price and thus stimulating output so as to give manufacturers an
opportunity of spreading their overhead over a larger tonnage.
TRANSPORT COSTS.
There is a certain amount of variation in the railway freights
on_ superphosphate in the respective States. The following table,
which summarises the rates per ton in the States shows also the compar-
atively high rates charged in Couth Australia
TABLE XX.
(1) Special '7, A. rate applies from December to the end of March
and is sometimes extended to April and May. The average for
the State based on an average haul of 147 miles is 5/ld. P er
ton to v/hich must be added cost of sheet and haulage from
Companies 1 sidings,
(2) The average of the ordinary W,A« rate, based on 147 miles,
is Iq/ld, per ton plus sheet and haulage from Companies'
sidings.


In view of the fact that superphosphate is not a. profitable
load in any State, it appears unlikely that any reduction could be
effected, .The South Australian rates appear unduly high as compared
with other States, especially in view of the importance of super-
phosphate in the economics of farming and the benefici'al effect on
future freight earnings if more superphosphate were used. It is
suggested that this is a matter for the South Australian Government
and that it might receive very careful consideration as a means of
helping the farmer in the present difficult times.
In connection with railway freights generally, attention is
directed to the practice in New Zealand, where agricultural lime
in o—ton lots for bona fide farmers is carried 100 miles by rail
free of charge to the farmer, and where the railway freight on
artificial manures was reduced by 40 per cent some .years ago. The
whole of the loss of revenue to the Railways Department is recovered
from tne Consolidated Fund from the vote of the Department of
Agriculture. In 1930-31 the amounts payable to the Railways
Department were -
Lime ~ .. £44,395
Fertilisers £108,2§1
(3) In S.A, the maximum rate is 18/Bd. per ton, being the rate
for 240 miles. The special rates in S.A, apply from December
to the end of February.
(4) In Tasmania, a flat rate of 13/ per ton is charged to all
farmers irrespective of location. The rates for the different
mileages are shown for comparative purposes only.
MEANS BY WHICH PRICE TO THE CONSUMER MIGHT BE REDUCED,
While present conditions of reduced output and depressed
prices for primary products continue, there appears to be no
possibility of any large reduction in price of superphosphate.
Some purchasers may be able to reduce their own costs of super-
phosphate by taking advantage of concessions which are available,
but the only reductions in cost of manufacture which might be made
are small and would probably be offset by the increased price of
sulphur.
The following summary shows the headings under which some
relief might be obtained by purchasers
(1) Bulk Buying. - If a number of buyers in a district were
prepared to combine and purchase a large quantity for cash,
they would obtain the benefits of
(a) Special allowance for quantity rates, ranging from
2/6d. per ton upwards according to quantity;
(b) Cash discount;
(c) Agent’s commission would in most cases be eliminated.,
(2) Use of alternatives for Sulphur. - It is possible that the
present costs of manufacture of superphosphates would be
slightly reduced if pyrites were used instead of sulphur for
manufacture of sulphuric acid. In the absence of definite
information regarding costs of manufacture from pyrites,, no
estimate of the probable savings can be made. It would
appear, however, that a condition precedent to the use of
this material would be the removal of the duty on pyrites as


suggested by the Tariff Board in 1929, unless local pyrites of
quality equal to foreign can be produced and supplied in all
States at prices which will place them on a competitive basis
with imported sulphur. There are so many factors which might
affect the use of pyrites, the principal ones being the
possibility of a fall in price of sulphur and the cost of plant
necessary for treatment, that it is doubtful whether any except
a few factories would use them in lieu of sulphur.
(3) Wharfage Charges. - If the State Government of Victoria would
agree to reduce wharfage charges on phosphate rock and sulphur
and if other States agreed to make their charges uniform with
those in New South Wales or Tasmania, a small but definite
contribution in reduced cost of superphosphate could be made
by those Governments to the primary producers.
(4) Secondhand Bags.- - The more extensive use of secondhand bags,
provided they are in good condition, offers large buyers of
superphosphate an opportunity of reducing their cost. Most
Companies allow 5/- per dozen for farmers 1 own bags and several
of them provide special facilities for filling and despatching
farmers’ bags.
(5) Rail Freights - South Australia.- South Australian farmers would
derive considerable benefit from a reduction in rail freights to
a figure more in agreement with the rates in other States, if
such concession could be granted by the Railways Commissioners,
(6) Reduction of Manufacturers’ Costs by Increased Output.-
Manufacturers’ overhead costs and other varying charges per ton
are high at present owing to the reduced output as compared with
factory capacity. An increase in output would certainly result
in a reduction of these charges per ton of superphosphate.
The extent of the possible reduction cannot be gauged, but it is
likely that if output were increased to full capacity the reduc-
tion in cost which could be passed on by the Companies would
average 3/- per ton. The items included in this category are
Administration, Advertising, Taxation, Bad Debts, Depreciation,
and sundry small charges. It is useless, however, to consider
possible savings under this heading unless some suggestion can
be ma.de which will result in an increased output of superphos-
phate. This matter is discussed in the following section.
SUGGESTION FOR STIMULATING THE DEMAND FOR SUPERPHOSPHATE.
For the crop year the Commonwealth Government paid a
bounty of 4id. per bushel on wheat produced. It is anticipated that
the total bounty will amount to approximately £3,400,000. It is
suggested that an excellent substitute for the wheat bounty, if it is
proposed to continue some form of assistance to primary producers, would
be a subsidy on superphosphate purchased and used.
It is generally conceded that many areas in Australia would
benefit considerably in the shape of increased yields per acre if more
superphosphate per acre were' applied. Some districts have probably
obtained their optimum wheat yield per acre and additional applications
of superphosphate in those areas would not repay their cost. On the
other hand there are very large areas where farmers arc being urged to
increase the quantity of superphosphate used per cere so that the fullest
productivity combined with the minimum of cost per unit of production may
be obtained.
It is suggested that if the Government were to grant farmers a
subsidy of, say, £1 per ton on superphosphate purchased and used during


next season the results would be
(a) An increase in the consumption of superphosphate of at
least 25 per cent if farmers spent only the same amount
as they intend to spend at present prices,
(b) An additional increase in consumption due to some farmers
taking advantage of the reduced price, and spending more
than they would otherwise have spent.
(c) An increase in yield per acre if correct farming practice
is followed and a reasonably average season is experienced,
(d) A reduction in cost of manufacture of superphosphate on
account of increased output of factories. This should
mean a reduction of price apart from the subsidy.
(e) The farmer, given an average season, should obtadn soma
addition to his income by reason of the increased yield
the cost of which would be only the extra expenditure
on superphosphate and the cost of harvesting, bagging
and carting the wheat.
It is very difficult to assess just what the financial
results of such a policy would be, but the consumption of super-
phosphate in Australia would probably increase from 700,000 tons
(the present estimate) to 1,000,000 tons. This would bring the_
factories ! output nearly up to capacity, and would mean a reduction
in overhead and other charges which vary with output to the extent
of probably 5/ — per ton. It is considered that if the Government
provides a subsidy to the extent suggested, the Companies should
be prepared to contribute 5/-* per ton saved in overheads towards a.
further reduction in the price of superphosphate.
Any such increased output is dependent, of course, on
the Companies being able to obtain adequate supplies of uhosphate
rock and sulphur,
A subsidy of £1 per ton on superphosphate purchased and
used would cost the Government approximately £1,000,000.
The farmer who is not using the optimum amount of super-
phosphate per acre at present (and these are in the majority) would
have an opportunity to increase his application without very heavy
additional cost.
In the Victorian Journal of Agriculture for February, 1931*
the Agricultural Superintendent, Mr. H. A. Mullett, published tables
showing the yields and returns obtained by using varying quantities
of superphosphate per acre on the Departments experimented wheat
plots over a number of years, Mr, Mullett showed the position
with wheat at 4/6d,, 2/- and l/6d. per bushel, respectively. In
view of recent improvements in wheat prices, the calculations based
on 2/- per bushel have been revised on a basis of. 3/“ P er bushel.

at Werribee £4/12/3 per ton.
Despite all the propaganda regarding the advantages of
increased dressings of artificial fertilisers as a contribution
towards reduction of cost of production, the average quantity used
per acre has increased only 12 lbs, since 1910/1913* The average
dressing for that period, according to the Commonwealth Statistician,
was 75 lbs., and had increased to 87 lbs. for 1929/1930* Tn 1930/1931
there was a slight decline owing to the inability of many farmers to
purchase their full requirements on account of the fall in their
income.
The tables published by the Victorian Department of Agri-
culture give a very good indication of the benefits to be obtained
from using greater quantities of superphosphate per acre, and they
also demonstrate how the optimum quantity per acre is dependent on the
two factors, viz, cost of superphosphate and price of wheat. Obvious-
ly, if the actual increased cash return from 2 cwts. of superphosphate
per acre is equal to or less than that from li cwts. per acre, no
good purpose would be served by putting on the larger quantity, unless
additional benefit were obtained from the residue in the soil. It is
submitted, however, that there is room for a definite increase in the
average quantity per acre, and that if this increase amounted only to
50 per cent of the present average application, the increased return
per a.cre would more than repay the cost. The result should be
particularly attractive if a subsidy of £1 per ton were granted on
all superphosphate used.
It should be possible to increase the average yield of
wheat by 2 bushels per acre by using 50 per cent more superphosphate
provided conditions are favourable and good farming methods are
adopted. If such results or anything approa.ching them were obtained,
the increased yield would be practically all profit to the farmer,
provided the price of superphosphate were reduced by £l/5/- per ton.
including the £1 per ton subsidy.


SUMMARY
Since the Tariff Board made its report in 1929 recommending
a reduction in the price of superphosphate, there has been a definite
change in the outlook of Australia's primary industries. A disas-
trous fall in prices combined with depressed trading conditions has
caused farmers to curtail severely their expenditure on superphosphate
and other artificial manures and, as a result, the output of super-
phosphate, after increasing progressively each year up to 932,209
t°ns in 1929/30, fell to 660,131 tons in 1930/31 and to approximately
700,000 tons in 1931/32. These figures when compared with an
estimated total output capacity of 1,200,000 tons, indicate the heavy
burden of overhead costs carried by superphosphate manufacturers in
the past two years. Notwithstanding this, the price of superphos-
phate which was reduced to £4/10/- for cash and £4/15/" for terms in
3' r n ot oeen increased since that date. Compared with prices
in 19--3/14 on the basis of water soluble phosphoric acid content the
price at present is 14.7$ -sss than in 1913/14? although there has
been an increase in cost of all raw materials except phosphate rock
during that period.
Superpnosphate is of primary importance in the economic
development of Australia. All the evidence available points to a
greater annual demand for this fertiliser in the future than in she
lts importance for wheat-growing and topdressing of pastures
cannoo be too greatly stressed and its more extensive use is dependent
only on Improved economic conditions in those industries. Experi-
mental and demonstration work on the part of the Departments of
Agriculture and the Superphosphate Companies has clearly shown the
advantages which will accrue from increased dressings of superphos-
phate on suitable lands, particularly wheat and pastures.
There is no reason for anticipating any shortage of phos-
phate rock or sulphur which are the two main constituents of super-
phosphate, Australia is entitled under an agreement between the
British, Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments to 42 pe:~ cent of
the output of pnosphate rock from Nauru and Ocean Island and to a
fw\ ler per cent if the United Kingdom does not take her share
(42%). There are ample supplies of rocrk for many years on the
islands. World reserves of sulphur are also extensive and in
addition Australia has large deposits of pyrites and zinc from which
sulphur can be obtained.
It appears doubtful whether any advantage would accrue from,
using foreign pyrites for manufacture of sulphuric acid, despite the
of sulphur, but the local deposits of this mineral
offer distinct possibilities, provided the sulphur content can be
excracteo at a cost comparable with the landed cost of sulphur-
bulphur produced from local pyrites is eligible for the Commonwealth
bounty of £2/5/- per ton less reduction under the Financial Emergency
Act. b
The major items in cost of production of superphosphate are
raw^ materials. The average cost of these materials at present is
at £2/4/3 per ton.. Costs of manufacture, dressing,
depreciation, general charges and despatch average approximately
*l/0/10 per ton.
Overhead costs and selling charges per ton fluctuate accord-
ing to output and at present are unduly/ heavy on account of reduced
production. It is considered that if output could be increased to a
equivalentivalent to that of 1929/30 ii would bo possible to reduce
one price of superphosphate by probably 5/- per ton. A further
reduction "would be possible if the whole of the proposed increased
output from Nauru and Ocean Island could be taken Victorian


Western Australian and South Australian manufacturers could acnie\e
some reduction in costs if their wharfage charges could be reduces,
to the same figures as operate in New South Wales and Tasmania.
All Companies have experienced difficulties, either directl/
or indirectly, as a result of the necessity for writing off large
amounts of had debts in recent years, but the latest figures show a
considerable reduction of outstanding accounts. Neverthel ess ,heavy
losses on this account appear inevitable and manufacturers 1
are likely to be seriously affected by this item until the financial
position of farmers improves.
As regards the marketing and distribution of superphosphare,
agent’s commission offers a limited field for saving to farmers but
only if all manufacturers agree to follow the same procedure. Many
farmers can help themselves by performing work which is at present
performed by agents but others a,re not in a position to do so.
It appears reasonable that those farmers who do not all the
services rendered by or available from agents should pay only
those services which they do require. Other directions in whxch
farmers might pay closer attention to marketing and distrioution are
in the adlowances for cash, for early delivery, for large quantifies
and for secondhand sacks where conditions are suitable for their use-
An example from South Australia shows how a farmer can save up to
12/9d per ton by taking advantage of the concessions available in
that State.
Transport charges vary as between the respective States,
but the outstanding features are the comparatively heavy charges in
South Australia and the fixation of a flat rate, regardless of dis-
tance, in Tasmania. A real service would be rendered to farmers in
South Australia if the Government could see its way clear to reduce
the freight rates in that State.
The only country with which Australian prices can be fairly
compared is New Zealand, as the phosphate rock for the Dominion is
obtained from the same source as that for Australia.. As a rcsuj.t of
a Government subsidy of 11/~ per ton plus a reduction 01 b/ ou per ton
by the Companies, the price in New Zealand was reduced to £3/17/6 in
1931 • Subsequently the Companies were-permitted so increase tne
price by 5/“ per ton. In July 1932 the Government suosidy was
"reduced to 8/lOd per ton and the Companies reduced their price by
2/6d so that the present cash selling price is £4 per ton and the
Companies receive £4/8/10 as compared with £4/10/- in Australia.
If the Government should decide to continue assistances to
the farming community, it is suggested that such assistance might
take the -form of a subsidy of £1 per ton on superphosphate usqa in
the 1932/33 season. This subsidy could take the place of part 01
the present wheat bounty, and, in our opinion, would oe a much more
satisfactory way of helping farmers. The producers would oe en-
couraged to use more superphosphate and given a reasonable season
would reap their reward in increased yields at rower cost per unit
of production. The increased consumption of superphosphate
increase the manufacturers r output and it is considered that a price
reduction of probably b per ton would be possiqle ix tms desiraple
object wore achieved, such reduction to oe in addition op the i suboxcn ,
making a total reduction of £l/5/-„per ton.. It is submitted rnat
this suggestion, by reason of its l ar—reaching benefits, should
receive favourable consideration.

PYRITES.
SUMARY OF INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY
MINES DEPARTMENT IN THE VARIOUS STATES.
QUEENSLAND.
Up to date no search has been made for barren pyritio
ore suitable for the manufacture of sulphuric acid only.
The principal cupriferous deposits in which iron pyrites
is the chief sulphide constituent are situated at Mount Morgan,
Many Peaks, and Mount Cha3.mer s, and possibly at Mount Cannindah
where the deposit has been proved only to a small extent.
Mount Morgan has reserves of about 7,500,000 tons (10-20$
~ probable average sulphur content). The ore was utilised
for the manufacture of sulphuric acid for many yea.rs by
the Mt. Morgan Gold Mining Company.
Many Peaks had reserves amounting to 1,000,000 tons in
1912 (sulphur content about 355) •
Mount Chalmers had reserves estimated at 450,000 tons in
1914 (sulphur content 10-20$).
Costs of manufacture of sulphuric acid from these
deposits are not available.
TASMANIA.
Mount Lyell. The most important source of pyrites suit-
able for the manufacture of sulphuric acid is at
Mount Lyell where the quantity available is estimated
at 1,500,000 tons containing 40-50$ sulphur. Production
costs of the ore sure estimated at 15/" P er ton at the
mine.
Renison Bell. Further extensive deposits probably exceeding
17000,000 tons occur at Renison Bell on the route of _
the Emu Bay Railway, The average sulphur content is
estimated at 355. production costs are estimated at
10./-to 12/- per ton F.O.R. Renison Bell, 36 miles from
the port of Strahan.
Chester. A pyritic deposit estimated at approximately
3,000,000 tons situated on the eastern fall of
Mt.Kershaw, 7i miles to the north of the township of
Rosebery in the West Coast District. The probably
average sulphur content is about 20$. The above
represent the main deposits of crude pyritic ore. In
addition, potential sources of ore for the manufacture
of sulphuric acid occur in the residue from Ox e whicn
has been treated for other purposes. The main deposits
of this nature are as follow
Mt. Lyell• It is estimated that 60 to 100 tons of ore
containing approximately 50$ sulphur could be recovered
daily from the residues from the flotation piano, The
cost of recovery would be less than 5/" P er ton.


Pei d-Rcsebery Zinc Lead Deposits., I- is estimated
~lF(Ttons" of pyritic concentrates, containing up oO 50/*
sulphur, could be extracted daily from residues.
production costs would approximate those at Mo.l.yeJ—<
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Pyrites deposits occur in places in Western Austrtl-c.
Tout definite information as to the commercial possibilities is
not available. It is stated that concentrates the
flotation plant at the Lake View and Star Mine, Kalgocrlie,
might he a potential source for the manufacture of -uiphur -
acid •
new south wales,
Two large bodies of pyritic ore have been developed
as follows
Lake George. A deposit approximating 2,000,000 tons
estimated to contain 35$ sulphur. to date no
production of sulphur from this source nas taken p-cxe-.
Leadville. 53 000 tons of iron pyrites containing 43;^$
sulphur have been exposed in the present working, out it
is possible that prospecting would reveal considerau-y
more. Pyrites from here are actually being used at
present.
VICTORIA..
No body of pyrites is known to occur.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
There is no South Australian source which can provide
pyrites at the present time.
