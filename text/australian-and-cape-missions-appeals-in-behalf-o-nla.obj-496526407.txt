AUSTRALIAN AND CAPE MISSIONS.
Four New Bishoprics in the Colonies. —Provision for Additional
Clergy.
At a General Meeting of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
in Foreign Parts, held at the Society’s House, No. 79, Pall Mall, on
Friday, March 19th, 1847, His Grace the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, President, in the Chair : it was agreed that the following
Statement be adopted, printed, and circulated ;
The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel earnestly desires to
make known the following facts :
The Society is pledged to the full amount of its current income for
the support of Missionaries already upon its roll, the encouragement of
theological Students, being candidates for Missionary employment, and
the general sustenance of existing Missions. The Society has no
disposable capital whatever in reserve. But more Clergymen are
required in all the Colonies, both for the ministrations of religion
among British settlers, and for the instruction and conversion of
the heathen. And while the deficiency in the means of grace is
already so great, the stream of emigration flows on more rapidly than
ever.
The number of those who went out to the Colonies last year was
about fifty thousand ; and it is estimated that the amount of emigration
for the current year will considerably exceed that of 1846. Thus the
claims upon the Society are rapidly increasing.
Four more Bishoprics are about to be erected in important, but
hitherto much neglected, divisions of our Colonial empire. Two of
these will be formed out of the present Diocese of Australia:—namely,
one at Melbourne, to comprise the district of Port Phillip, and the
other probably at Newcastle, for the northern counties of New South
Wales. The third will be at Adelaide , for the rapidly growing Colony
of South Australia, with jurisdiction over the Swan River settlements ;
and the fourth will be for the Cape of Good Hope.
The Society, while hailing this extension of the Colonial Episcopate
with the liveliest feelings of satisfaction and thankfulness, is sensible of
the new demands wdiich will be thereby created for more Churches and
more Missionaries, and is anxious, and, under God’s blessing, resolved,
to bear its part in supplying them. This, however, it has been shown,
cannot be done out of its existing means.
The Society, therefore, confidently appeals to the Christian people
of England for further help. Our felhnv-countrymen are forced out,
by the pressure of poverty, from their native land, where they enjoyed
the blessings of a parish church and a parish school, to countries where
frequently neither church nor school is within reach. Such is the case
a 2


in many districts of all the British Colonies, and in none more than in those
which are now to be placed under the superintendence of Bishops. But the
appointment of Bishops must be followed by that of additional Clergymen
for the service of the several destitute stations; and these Clergymen
must, for a time, and in part at least, be sustained from home. Not fewer
than from sixteen to twenty will be at once required to accompany the
Bishops who are going forth ; and the maintenance of these Clergy
(exclusive of what may be raised from their several congregations) can
hardly be estimated at a less sum than 2,000/. annually : a further sum
of about 3,000/. will, in the first instance , be required for their passage
and outfit.
The Society, fully sensible of the vast importance of strengthening
the hands of the Bishops on first taking possession of their new Sees,
and feeling that the present is a great crisis in the condition of the
Colonial Church, is determined to spare no exertions to meet the
emergency.
It is desirous, indeed, to give a larger measure of assistance to all
the Colonies, but would consider it a shame and reproach to allow the
new Bishops to proceed to their respective Dioceses without the means
of securing the services of those Clergymen who may be willing to
.accompany them. The help, therefore, that is wanted for this’particular
object is immediate, and will, if accorded at once, be doubly useful, by
enabling the Bishops before leaving England to select Clergymen, or
Candidates for Holy Orders, for their respective Dioceses.
The new Sees have not been endowed without a very singular
exercise of individual liberality. The two in New South Wales could
not have been erected without the abandonment, on the part of the
Bishop of Australia, of a very considerable portion of his life-income ;
and those for the Cape of Good Hope and South Australia have
been founded by the exemplary munificence of one member of our
Church.
It is hoped that such high examples of Christian self-denial and
bounty will not be without their influence in awakening the charity of
others ; and as some persons may have a special interest in one par-
ticular Colony, it is proposed that annual subscriptions and contributions
be received in behalf either of the four new Dioceses generally, or any
one of them in particular.
It should be distinctly understood that the principle on which the
Society acts is to contribute, in some given proportion, to the funds
raised in each particular district, and to limit its contribution to a certain
period of time. In the present case it is considered that the income to
be guaranteed out of the funds which may be placed at the disposal of
the Society should be restricted to five years.
When it is considered that the appeal now made is in behalf of many
thousands of our poorer brethren, scattered over remote provinces of
the Great British Empire, it is hoped that the answer to it may be such
as to justify the Society in encouraging the four new Bishops to accept
the services of such Candidates as they may consider well qualified to
accompany them on their holy Mission.

The Special Committee, in connexion with the Society for the Pro-
pagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, beg to invite the kind co-ope-
ration of their Christian friends in England in the endeavour to raise
a fund towards the outfit and maintenance, for a limited period, ot
additional Clergymen in the new Diocese of Melbourne ; to the chaigo
of which the Right Rev. Charles Perry, D.D.. late Fellow and Tutor of
Trinity College, Cambridge, has been appointed.
This Diocese comprehends the territory usually known by the name
of Australia Felix, or the Province of Port Phillip, and extends about
500 miles from East to West, and 250 in its broadest part from North
to South. Although the settlement was founded entirely by the enter-
prise of private individuals, and only eleven years ago, the European
population already exceeds 35,000; and it is every year receiving
large additions by immigration from England, Sidney, Van Diemens
Land, and other places.
Melbourne, the principal town, contains at least 10,000 inhabitants.
Williams Town, the port of Melbourne, and 6 miles distant, contains
about 500 settled inhabitants ; and is, at particular seasons of the year,
much frequented by those who are employed in bringing down woo , &c.
for exportation, and by sailors belonging to the shipping in the harbour.
Geelong, a town situate on the western shore of Port Phillip, con-
tains about 2,000 inhabitants, and is rapidly rising in importance.
There is also a town at Portland Bay, 250 miles ty the westward,


containing about 800 inhabitants ; and another between this and Mel-
bourne at Port Fairy, the population of which is not mentioned in any
account of the province ; but its importance may be inferred from the
establishment of a regular weekly post to it from Melbourne.
To the east of Melbourne, on the Coast of Gipps Land, is Albert
Town ; of recent origin, but already a place ot considerable trade, and
likely to become the chief port of that large and fertile district.
There is a small village called St. Kilda, about 3 miles from Mel-
bourne ; and 5 miles beyond, upon the Bay of Port Phillip, another
called Brighton, the favourite watering-place for the more wealthy
inhabitants of Melbourne. This consists at present chiefly ot villas,
and its population does not exceed 150 persons ; but it may be expected
to increase.
The rest of the European inhabitants live more or less dispersedly
through the province. A considerable number, amounting probably,
with the farm-servants, to nearly 3,000, are settled in the neighbourhood
of Melbourne and Geelong. There are several considerable proprietors
at a place called Heidelberg, about 8 miles from the former ; and a
large number at Mount Macedon, about 50 miles from the same town.
The importance of this last place is indicated by its having a regular
weekly post.
The above statement will explain in some degree the nature of the
new Diocese. Its spiritual destitution is shown by the circumstance,
that there appear to be at present only three Clergymen and Churches
in the whole Province : viz. one at Melbourne, another at Geelong, and
a third at Portland Bay. There is another Church nearly, if not com-
pletely, finished at Melbourne ; and there will be no difficulty, accord-
ing to the terms of the Colonial Church Act, in obtaining a stipend for
the Clergyman who shall be appointed to it.
This Act provides, that, where a sum of at least 300/. has been
raised by private contribution and applied towards the building of a
Church or dwelling, a sum may be issued from the Colonial funds not
exceeding 1000/. Likewise, where 100 adults subscribe a declaration
of their desire to attend any proposed Church or Chapel, the Governor
may allow the Minister 100/. a-year; it 200 shall subscribe, 150/.
a-year. If 500 adults subscribe the declaration, then 200/. a-year may
be allowed. There is also a power of issuing 100/. a-year, when less than
100 subscribe, given to the Governor, subject to the consent ot the
Executive Council. When there is no Church or Chapel, the Governor
may issue any sum not exceeding 100/, a-year, to meet an equal
amount of private contributions. The Act draws no distinction what-
ever between any religious Communities; but regulations were pub-
lished, dated Oct. 4, 1830, setting forth the English, Scottish, and
Romish Churches, as the special objects of these provisions ; adding,
however, that applications from any other denominations of Christians
would be taken into consideration according to the special circumstances
of the case.
It will be seen that this Act provides a fund, upon which, and upon
the liberality of the Colonists themselves, we may depend for the main-
tenance of Clergymen in every populous tow nship, where the doctrines


and discipline of the Church of England have obtained a hold upon the
affections of the peoples but the assistance of its members in this
country is needed, in the first instance, to plant the Church ; so that
the ground may not, as is frequently the case, be pre-occupied by other
parties; or, as is yet more often the melancholy result, the people
become utterly indifferent to every form of Christianity. At present
the destitution of Ministerial instruction, and religious ordinances, is
most deeply felt; and very urgent appeals have been addressed to the
Archbishop of Canterbury and others upon the subject.
It is therefore most desirable, that the Bishop should take out with
him a small number of persons, either ordained, or ready for ordination,
to whom a certain income may be guaranteed for a period of five years ;
their maintenance afterwards to depend altogether upon Colonial
resources. There are actually wanted at once, besides a Minister for
the new Church at Melbourne, for whom we are not called to provide
a maintenance, at least eight Clergymen, viz. :
One for Williams Town, One for Heidelberg,
One for Port Fairy, One for the population in the
One for Albert Town, neighbourhood of Geelong,
One for Mount Macedon,
and two to itinerate among the scattered inhabitants of the Bush, who
still remain, as a Colonial document some years ago stated them to be,
“ without the observance of the Lord’s Day, without the celebration of
public worship, without the ministrations of religion, and without even
the occasional visits of a Clergyman either to counsel or comfort, rebuke
or exhort.”
In this estimate of the wants of the Diocese no account is taken of
the Aboriginal inhabitants, amounting, according to the most probable
calculations, to about 4,000. It is felt, that we must first make pro-
vision for the necessities of our own brethren and fellow-Christians ; and
afterwards we may hope, w'ith the blessing of God, to be enlarged
abundantly, so as to preach the Gospel of Christ to the heathen also.
The allowance for outfit and passage-money to each unmarried Cler-
gyman, ought not to be less than 150/!., and to each married one, 200/.;
and the income, which it is proposed to guarantee to them for five
years, is 150/., and 200/., respectively. Towards this latter portion of
the expense, considerable help may be expected from the Colonists
themselves; who, in some places, as at Mount Macedon and Heidel-
berg, have already expressed their readiness to contribute to this object.
It is therefore calculated, that the scheme may be accomplished, if there
can be raised in this country a present sum of 1,400/., together with
annual subscriptions for five years to the amount of 1,000/., equivalent
to about 4,500/. present value.
But besides providing Clergymen, it is very necessary that a fund
should be raised towards building Churches and Schools. The sum ot
1,500/. or 2,000/., placed at the disposal of the Bishop for this purpose,
would greatly encourage the people in the endeavour to procure for
themselves suitable places of public worship, and thus materially pro-
mote the speedy and permanent establishment of the pure religion of
our beloved Church among them. Thus, the whole amount, which it


is wished to raise, is about B,ooo£ ; but much more, if it could be pro-
cured, might be most advantageously expended.
It is now, while this Colonial settlement is in its infancy, that we
may hope, with the blessing of God, to lay the foundation of the
Church broadly and firmly; so that, as it rises in importance, the
Church also may rise proportionably. If we earnestly endeavour to
accomplish this object, our enlarged wisdom and philanthropy will
probably become the source of blessings to a mighty nation throughout
future ages. If we neglect to do it, there will be added another ex-
ample of that painful contrast which the history of our colonial empire
so strongly exhibits, between the active enterprise of the British Mer-
chant and the supine apathy of the British Christian. The Committee
trust, however, that the members of our Church are at length awakened
to a sense of their privileges and their responsibilities ; and that we
shall not lose the precious opportunity, which is now afforded us, of
presenting to the Colonists of Port Phillip that inestimable gift, which
God has, in his infinite mercy, bestowed upon us. O may we show our
value for the treasure of a pure Gospel, by our earnest, self-denying
exertions to communicate it to others, and especially to the children of
our own soil, who have settled in a distant land !
Several Clergymen, and young men desirous to receive ordination,
have expressed their wish to accompany the Bishop; and there is,
therefore, a good hope of obtaining a sufficient number of suitable
labourers, if sufficient means can be obtained for their maintenance.
It may be mentioned, that any contributions, made to the Society for
the Propagation of the Gospel, for the benefit of a particular Diocese,
are, by the rules of the Society, placed at the disposal of the Bishop of
that Diocese.

The Diocese of Newcastle comprises the seven northern counties of
New South Wales, Northumberland, Gloucester, Hunter, Durham.


Brisbane, Bligh, and Phillip, together with immense grazing districts
beyond the boundaries of location. It extends north and south from
latitude 26° to latitude 33° 30', about 500 miles, and from east to west
through 11 degrees of longitude (141° to 152°), about 700 miles.
Nearly a third of this vast area, containing about 120,000 square miles,
an area equal to the whole of Great Britain and Ireland, is already
occupied by settlers, whose number is estimated to exceed 40,000.
In this vast Diocese there are at present only seventeen Clergy, and
the necessary consequence has been, that extensive districts are entiiely
destitute of religious instruction and religious ordinances. A family
lately returned to England from one of these districts, have declared
that they did not once see a Clergyman during the space of seven
y ears#
The statements of the Bishop of Australia with respect to the spiritual
destitution of some of these counties, and of the districts beyond the
boundaries of location, deserve the most earnest attention. His Lord-
ship writes in a letter dated the 3d of July, 1843 :
“I may observe that during my present progress I have been in one
county, Durham, in the whole extent of which there is not a Church,
and but one Clergyman. In the adjoining county of Brisbane there
is one Clergyman and one Church —no more. After this 1 shall pass
through three entire counties, in which there is neither minister nor
ordinance of religion; and the five counties included in this enumera-
tion contain a fourth part of the area of New South Wales. Surely it
is truly observed in the Report of the Society for the I ropagation oi
the Gospel in Foreign Parts for 1844, p. 92Nothing can be more
appalling than the foregoing statement, of five entire countits, foiming a
fourth part of the area of New South Wales, having but two Churches
and two Clergymen.” Of these five counties, four are in the Diocese of
Newcastle.
The vast districts beyond the boundaries of location are in even a
more fearful state of spiritual destitution. Of these the Bishop of
Australia writes, in a letter dated 22d June, 1844 :
“ My chief anxiety, however, at this time, is concerning the districts
beyond the boundaries, over which population is extending rapidly,
without attendant provision even for their maintenance in the belief of
Christianity. Upon the fearful deficiency under which these extensive
tracts are suffering, and apparently condemned to suffer, I have
already addressed you.”
Elsewhere his Lordship writes : —“ It is impossible to estimate too
highly the services which our Clergy are here placed in a condition to
confer, inasmuch as they may in reality be said, as far as theii restricted
efforts can accomplish it, to be resisting the establishment of the domi-
nion of Atheism, it may appear a strong term to employ, but I use it
deliberately, upon conviction, from experience.”
Even in the more favoured districts, which are placed under the care
of their appointed pastor, it may be interesting to observe the laborious
but imperfect nature of the duties performed. The Rev. E. Smith, in
a report to the Bishop of Australia, says, “ I have arranged to visit
each station in my district once in three weeks.


“ Ist Sunday. Service at Palmerville, and service at Mr. Hall’s, a
distance of three miles.
“2d Sunday. At Mr. Weston’s or Mr. Wright’s alternately, the men
belonging to the two establishments uniting ; I then ride ten miles, and
have a service at Mount Campbell. Mr. Wright’s is twenty-two miles
from this, and Mount Campbell ten miles from Mr. Wright’s, so that
my services on the second Sunday, when I go to Mr. Wright’s, take me
a ride of about fifty-two miles.
“3d Sunday. I ride seven miles, and have service at Mr. Moore’s ;
this unites three establishments. I then ride eight miles, and have
service at the Queenbayan Inn. I then ride six miles, and have service
at Pinlego, Mr. R. Campbell’s. Thus on the third Sunday I have three
services, and ride about twenty miles.”
Such are the truly missionary labours of a Chaplain in the vast dis-
trict which constitutes the Diocese of Newcastle.
No mention has been made of any project to convert the native Aus-
tralian population, because such large tracts occupied by English settlers
are still entirely destitute of religious ordinances. It is, however,
earnestly desired and confidently expected, that at least one unattached
Missionary will be ere long employed among these unfortunate heathen,
fresh tribes of whom have recently been discovered in the northern
parts of the Diocese.
From these statements, the vast extent and spiritual destitution of
this newly-erected See may be distinctly gathered. And to meet these
difficulties and supply these wants, it is the earnest desire of the Bishop-
designate of Newcastle to take out with him a limited number of Clergy
and Candidates for Orders. Four Clergy are at the lowest computation
immediately required :
One at the station of Paterson, which is vacant ;
One in the destitute counties of Phillip and Bligh ; and
Two in the vast districts of New England and the Liverpool Plains.
It is proposed to take out also four Candidates for Orders. They
will be prepared for Ordination, either at the College lately opened at
Sydney, or in the house, and under the superintendence of the Bishop
of Newcastle : and when ordained, will be stationed in some of the
many districts which the Bishop of Australia has described as so fear-
fully destitute of all religious privileges.
The offers of devoted aid, from both Clergy and Candidates for
Orders, have been sufficiently numerous to justify the expectation, that
their numbers need be limited solely by a prudential regard to the
amount of funds available for their immediate outfit and their future
maintenance; remembering always—for it ought ever to be remem-
bered —that the principle on which this Appeal is made, and on which
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts desires
to act, is to contribute in some given proportion to the funds raised in
each particular district, and to limit the contribution to a certain period
of time, as in this case to the period of five years.
What funds, then, are required, that the Bishop of Newcastle may
carry out with him to his Diocese four Clergymen and four Candidates
for Ordination ? On the most moderate computation, the outfit and


passage for four Clergymen, (taking the married and unmarried
together,) cannot require a less sum than 800/. And similar expenses
for four Candidates for Orders (even with the aid expected from their
friends) cannot require a less sum than 400/., making an immediate
outlay of 1,200/.
Again, the incomes of the four Clergymen cannot be estimated at
less than 600/. per annum ; while a sum of 100/. per annum may suffice
for the personal expenses of the four Candidates for Orders some pro-
portion of such expenses being supplied from their own resources, and
the Bishop cheerfully undertaking to provide them with board and
lodging in his own house.
The funds, then, which are required on the most moderate computa-
tion, are the present sum of 1,200/., and subscriptions for five years, to
the amount of 700/. per annum.
This statement is put forth, and this Appeal is made in behalf of the
newly-erected Diocese of Newcastle, Australia, in firm reliance, that, by
the Divine blessing, sufficient funds will be provided for the outfit and
moderate maintenance of devoted, self-denying men, who are willing to
leave country and friends and family for a distant land, where they
desire to labour for the glory of their God and the salvation of their
fellow-creatures.

The Colony of South Australia, founded in the year 1836, has risen
with unexampled rapidity in numbers and importance. Its population
is now believed to exceed 25,000 ; and from the rich mines of copper
and lead, discovered in many parts of the Colony, an extraordinary
increase by immigration, both from Europe and the neighbouring
Colonies, may be expected. The concentration, however, of the popu-


lation consequent upon mining operations, while it calls for the
immediate supply of religious ordinances, affords, at the same time, the
best hope of their being effectually supplied. From the annexed
tabular statement, it appears that two additional Clergymen are required
for North and South Adelaide, with their adjacent villages, Thebarton,
Hindmarsh, Walkerville, Goodwood, &c. Seven other districts (besides
Port Adelaide, Mount Barker, Gawler, which have resident Clergymen)
are sufficiently peopled to call for the residence, or missionary visits, of
a Pastor.
The population of Western Australia, on the other hand, is scattered
over an immense extent of country, but with exemplary zeal, aided by
friends and societies in England, the members of our Church have
provided for six Clergymen, and have built suitable churches for them
to perform their duties. They have also built four substantial churches
where the offices of a Clergyman cannot be obtained, the inhabitants
of those districts preferring to hear the service read by the nearest
magistrate, until a Minister can be provided with a maintenance. One
of these districts, King George’s Sound, is so distant from all other
settled parts of the Colony, that many months often elapse without a
Clergyman visiting it. The children are consequently unbaptized—(he
sacraments are not administered —marriages are, perforce, civil contracts
—and the dead are buried without the rites of the Church! Ihc
Colony has been established seventeen years : all the churches are un-
consecrated —the youth are unconfirmed —and at the Vasse the dead
are buried in the fields ; yet notwithstanding the great disadvantages
under which it labours, it is gratifying to add that the criminal statistics
show fewer offences against the law than any other of our possessions
in the East. It is almost vain to hope that this character can be
maintained unless some better provision for the spiritual instruction and
superintendence of the rising generation is made by our Churchy dhe
Romanists have already planted theirs in its completeness in the
Colony. They have founded a Bishopric, and are establishing convents,
schools, institutes, &c., —planting the Church first, and trusting, by its
presence, to obtain a hold on the people; and the result shows that they
have calculated correctly on the weakness of the Church of England.
Their numbers were not 200 when the first priest landed—now it is
feared they already exceed 600.
A considerable effort has likewise been made in South Australia by
the South Australian Church Society. A sum of 300/. has been col-
lected in the past year, and it is hoped that by regular contributions
from every individual belonging to our Church, a considerable yearly
income may be realised. Subscriptions to the amount of 1,650/. have
also been made since 1844, towards liquidating the debt on Trinity
Church. But until local resources can be fully and systematically
developed, the presence and labours of more Clergy are needed ; and for
their temporary support, the aid of the Mother Country is needed. It
must be remembered that Clergy, churches, school-houses, parsonages,
glebes, are all needed ; it can hardly be expected that, amid the struggles
of a young Colony, such objects can adequately be provided out of the
limited capital of the industrious emigrant. It is during the trying period

in vain for, the support of his fellow-Cbristians and fellow-Churchmen;
members of the same body, and heirs of the same immortal hopes with
himself. Those who possess land, or other property in the Colony, or
whose relatives are settled there, will, it is believed, feel it to be their
especial privilege and duty to contribute according to their ability, for
the furtherance of this holy cause. An income of 100/. per annum,
together with an allowance of 120/. for outfit and passage, is the lowest
remuneration which can be justly offered to any Minister of the Gospel
who is willing to give himself to the Lord’s service in the Colonial
Churches. By the blessing of God it is hoped that many will be found
to go forth and labour in the vineyard, content with the simple measure
of food and raiment which will thus be supplied.
EXISTING CHURCH ESTABLISHMENT.
Besides the above districts, the special surveys of the Burra Burra,
Mount Barker, Reedy Creek, and Mount Remarkable, are presumed to
have from 200 to 300 people at each, and the number is very rapidly
increasing. At the Kapunda, Victoria, Montacute Mines, also, a


number of workpeople must be congregated; and the total of such
mining labourers, with their families, cannot, it is thought, be less than
4,000 souls.

Having been called to the office of Bishop of the Cape of Good
Hope, I desire to bring before those who may be willing to assist me
in the arduous work which I have undertaken some circumstances con-
nected with the religious condition of the Colony.
The Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, which has been in the
possession of Great Britain since 1806, comprises the southern ex-
tremity of the continent of Africa, from latitude 29° 30' south, and
between longitude 17° and 27° 30' east. Its length from east to west
is about 650 miles ; its average breadth from north to south is 240
miles ; being somewhat larger than Great Britain. The population may
be estimated at nearly 200,000, of whom 70,000 may be considered as
heathen, and 8,000 as Mahomedan.


The bulk of the English population resides in the Western Province,
in the neighbourhood of Cape Town, in Stellensbosch, and Swellen-
dam; and in the Eastern Province, in the districts of Albany and
Uitenhage.
The intermediate districts are chiefly occupied by the Dutch colonists,
who have their own congregations, and have ever shown a kindly spirit
to the members of the English Church scattered amongst them.
J subjoin a list of the Churches and Clergy so far as I have been able
to collect their statistics. It will be seen that there are not more than
fourteen Clergy of the Church of England scattered throughout this ex-
tensive colony. My first object will be to endeavour to increase the num-
ber of Clergy who will minister to the members of our own communion,
many of whom, I fear, are either living in a total neglect of religion,
or are cut off from the services and religious ordinances of their own
Church. I shall also need aid in providing Churches, Schools, and
Teachers. My second object will be to wipe oft’ the reproach hitherto
attaching to the Church of England for being almost the only commu-
nion of Christians which has not attempted to establish Missions among
the multitudes of heathen who are to be found within, and around, the
colony.
The large amount of the unconverted coloured population which is
to be found within the colony would alone demand our most earnest
endeavours to gather them into the Christian fold ; but I am also desi-
rous that the Church of England should bear its part in carrying the
blessings of the Gospel of peace to those Caffre tribes which are now
likely to be brought more directly under British influence.
Another important object to be kept in view will be to erect a Colle-
giate Institution, where I may live myself, and with one or two Clergy
endeavour to train young men for the ministry of our Church in the
colony. . .
It is for aid in these undertakings that 1 now appeal to my Christian
brethren in England. I fear that I cannot depend upon much imme-
diate assistance from the colony, which has recently suffered so severely
from the Caffre invasion ; and the present income of the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel is already pledged for other purposes to its
full amount. At the same time I wish it to be understood, that what-
ever aid is contributed from England will be employed only to meet the
exertions of the colonists themselves. For pecuniary aid, however, I
must, in the first instance, be mainly dependent for success in my plans
upon the funds contributed in England in answer to the special appeal
which lam now making. I shall of course also need (he assistance of
zealous and devoted men, and I shall be glad to have brought before me
the names of any who may be willing to accompany me.' Several very
valuable candidates have already offered their services, but I dare not
accept of their offer until I know what success may attend this appeal,
having nothing else to look to at the present moment but the liberality
of private individuals.
My Diocese will also comprehend the Island of St. Helena, which
is about a thousand miles from the Cape, and has never yet, I believe,
been visited by an English Bishop. This island contains a population

of 5,000, the large majority of whom are warmly attached to the com-
munion of our Church. lam very anxious to find a Clergyman for that
island who will assist the present Colonial Chaplain. The most praise-
worthy efforts have been made by the inhabitants of the island, poor as
well as rich, to raise a portion of such a Clergyman’s income from local
sources.
Contributions of Theological books, works on architecture, plans,
drawings, &c., of churches, schools, or houses, will be of great use. I
need not add, that I shall feel thankful for my brethren’s prayers, that
I may be strengthened and guided by the good Spirit of our God in the
responsible office to which I am called.
