Among the various topics which interest the public mind in the present
day, there perhaps is not one so thoroughly engrossing and so deeply
important as the subject of our Australian colonies, and their recently
discovered gold fields.
Thousands of our countrymen are leaving our shores for that
distant land, and tens of thousands have determined on following their
example, all anxiously hoping to be partakers of the golden treasure so
abundantly scattered over that extensive and most interesting portion of
her Majesty?s dominions. At such a time it can only be most desirable that
facilities should be afforded for obtaining information connected with
those colonies, and their capabilities as emigration fields; for this purpose
the Panorama has been produced, and, as it must be most important that
the information given, whether pictorially or otherwise, be such as can be
relied on, I take this opportunity of stating, that the sketches from which
the picture has been painted were made by myself, and carefully studied
during my residence of eight years in those colonies; and that from those
sketches the Panorama has been painted partly by myself, and wholly
under my direction. The marine subjects are by Mr. Robins, and the
Natural History by Mr. Weigall; the reputation those gentlemen have
obtained in their peculiar walks of art, and the result of their labours as
seen in the paintings composing the Panorama, I feel confident, will be
considered to the fullest extent satisfactory.
But as, in addition to the pictorial correctness of the subject, it has
been deemed most desirable that the features of the scenes should be
explained by one personally acquaintedj with the country, I shall add to
the selections from my Sketch Book a few rough Notes from a Journal
made during my wanderings in the Australian colonies.
The introductory portion of the picture is devoted to the illustration of
the voyage out, with regard to which I need scarcely say, that it will be


vi PREFACE.
| possible only to touch on its most prominent and characteristic features.
The distance from this country to Australia, taking the usual course of
vessels, is about 16,000 miles, occupying, on an average, something less
than four months. The recently commenced steam communication to that
country will, it is expected, afford a means of performing the passage in
about half that time; and no doubt it will be still further shortened by the
adoption of that line which crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and onwards
through the Pacific, thus bringing our antipodes within so reachable a distance
that a voyage round the world will be thought of little more importance than
was formerly attached to a trip up the Rhine.
As passengers for Australia frequently avoid the annoyances of the
upper channel passage by joining the vessel at Plymouth, we shall com-
mence our voyage there, and our first illustration will be a view of
Plymouth Sound.

A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA,
A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS.
PART I.
flpoutfr Smtnxr,
The scene which opens on us, considered either with regard
to its natural beauties, or in connection with the peculiar circum-
stances with which it is now invested, is one that will frequently
occur to the memory of the emigrant when in that distant land
which shall become the birthplace of his future family, his adopted
home; and, although the recollection may wear a shade of sadness
associated as it must be with the parting with old and dear
friends, yet with that recollection may also be connected a sense
of difficulties, and a struggling for existence experienced in his
native hountry, that will cause him thankfully to look around him
on those comforts and that independent position which in his
new home is ever the reward of prudence and industry.
The principal features of this scene are the Breakwater, the pic-
turesque heights of Mount Edgcumbe, and St. Nicholas?s or Drake?s
Island, in front of which lies our good ship, her sails unfurled, the
anchor about to be weighed, and the Blue Peter flying at her
foremast, announcing that she is ready to commence her voyage.
All is now bustle and confusion on board, the deck is covered with
boxes, packages, and other luggage of those who have joined the
vessel at this place, and who, having delayed going on board


until the last moment, have lost the accommodation of the chair
which has been rigged out over the vessel?s side, and now have to
scramble up as they best can. Notice is given that all visitors are
to leave, the hour of parting has arrived, and the last farewells
of friends are drowned in the cheerful song of the sailors as the
anchor is raised to the ship?s bows.
CmnnmitMt 0f % Utopj*.
The vessel is on her way, and we are passing that great
national work the Breakwater ; from the lighthouse at the western
end it extends to within a mile of the cliffs, bounding the extreme
eastern side of this beautiful bay, at the southern point of which
is seen the Mew-Stone. Having cleared the land, and enjoyed the
advantage of a fair wind, we dismiss our pilot, and the captain
becomes invested with sovereign power. Night approaches, and
we now pass that wonderful example of human skill,
figMli.oiise
At times, and frequently for weeks together, the sea runs so high
that it is impossible to effect a landing on the rock. Formerly the
lighthouse was placed under the care of two men; during a
succession of gales one of the men died, and at that time, the
weather preventing any communication with the shore, and the
survivor fearing to throw the body into the sea, lest he might
be considered the murderer of his companion, he remained for a
considerable time in this lonely spot in company with the dead
body of his mate before the vessel which brought their customary
supplies arrived and relieved him from his most unpleasant posi-
tion. To avoid a recurrence of such an event, there are now
three men in charge.
As morning breaks, anxious eyes will be turned to the
direction in which Old England lies, but the wind has freshened,
and nothing now is seen but an unbroken horizon. The motion
of the vessel is not quite so pleasant as it has been, and those who


came on board at Plymouth will probably be insensible for awhile
to the pleasures of the table, and retire to the solitude of their
various cabins ; whilst those who date the commencement of their
voyage from Gravesend will have gained, as it is termed, their
sea legs, and now be in a state to enjoy the busy scene which
here, at the mouth of the Channel, is frequently to be witnessed.
A fair wind is bringing in an Indiaman, and other ships
homeward bound. The breeze increases, and the distant vessels we
observe are shortening sail: these symptoms are indicative of our
approach to the
Although it occasionally happens that the Bay of Biscay is
as calm as any other part of the ocean, we here introduce you to
it under that effect most frequently characteristic of it, a half
gale of wind.
The old well-known sea song, beginning,
? Ye gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease
How little do you know of the dangers of the sea,?
has raised in the imagination of many?l am certain it did in
mine?the idea that to be at sea was necessarily to be sur-
rounded with great and numerous perils. A few days? knocking
about, making you acquainted with your ship, and giving you
confidence in the skill and prudence of those by whom she is
managed, will tend to dissipate this feeling ; still there are catas-
trophes occasionally occurring, one of the most painful of which
is indicated by the cry that a man is overboard. The life-buoys
with which every ship is now provided, and which in emigrant
ships should be more especially the case, have generally the
effect of preventing even this disaster from being attended with
fatal consequences, for by the life buoy, or an empty cask, being
thrown to him, the unfortunate is generally able to keep himself
above water until he receives assistance from the ship.
A heavy sea is naturally calculated to raise images of terror
in the mind, but there are certain creatures, and those very little


ones, to whom it would appear productive of the greatest plea-
sure. These minute dwellers on the deep, Stormy Petrels, or as
sailors call them, ?Mother Carey?s Chickens,? usually keep
in the wakes of passing vessels, feeding on those scraps which
may be thrown from the ship ; and in their flight have very much
the appearance of swallows.
The breeze slackens, and we look forward to the enjoyment
of fine and warm weather, and more than all to our shortly ex-
pected arrival off the mountainous and lovely Island of Madeira.
The cry of ? Steamer ahead !? causes a rush to the vessel?s side,
and a hearty cheer is given as we pass the ? Propontis ? on her
return to England from the Cape ; with her appearance become
associated visions of home, and those that are left behind; but
other feelings are now called into action: we approach
Island jof glakini,
and its sunny clime and vine-covered hills are received as a fore-
taste of that country to which we are bound.


Vessels frequently put in here for the purpose of increasing
their stock of water, when the passengers fail not to take advan-
tage of the opportunity then afforded of laying in a store of the
delicious fruit with which the Island abounds, and which will be
so peculiarly acceptable in the warm latitudes now about to be
entered.
The Island is in possession of the Portuguese. From the
extreme beauty of its climate, it is much frequented by
invalids. The town at the base of the hill, is Funchal: it extends
to some distance behind the rising ground on which the citadel
is built; and, interspersed with the houses on the neighbouring
hills, are convents and other religious establishments. But we
must proceed with our voyage, and now we begin to form a better
idea of the extent of the Island, which is about 55 miles long and
10 miles broad.
When in our present latitude we may daily expect to fall in
with the trade wind which, on this side the Equator, constantly
blows from the north-east. Impelled by this steady and never
failing breeze, life on board ship becomes a matter of intense
enjoyment; here may be seen a little group watching with much
interest the rapid and graceful movements of the corophose, as in
shoals they playfully dart around our bows : these fish are fre-
quently mistaken for, and called by sailors, dolphins. Another
party is engaged with their fishing lines, hoping to tempt the
fish with a delicacy that has ceased to be a temptation to them-
selves, a slice of fat pork ; whilst on the poop, ladies shaded by
the awning (which in warm weather is almost constantly strained)
are engaged with their knitting and crochet needles, and other
little elegant employments. Suddenly there is a rush to the side
of the vessel to witness the shoals of flying fish which now may
be seen in all directions, rising from the water, their white bodies
beautifully glistening in the sun light; and, after flying a distance
of a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet, they drop into the
water, causing such an effect as would be produced by the
glancing of shot from its surface. Frequently do these little


creatures, in their haste to escape their enemies, the sea-gulls
(now seen in close pursuit), leap into the chains of the vessel, and
in many cases quite on to the deck, where of course they are
instantly taken prisoners : their bodies form a delicacy for the
table, whilst their wings are strained and dried on card-board?an
intended present for friends at home. We are now passing the
Its height is near 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, and it
may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 60 miles. Other
enemies of the little unfortunate flying fish now come in sight;
these are the true dolphins, who in their turn become the attacked
parties. Already a man has gone over the bows of the vessel, and,
standing on what is called the dolphin striker, has thrown his
harpoon with unerring aim; all press forward to see the prize,
not merely to witness its changing and beautiful colours, but to
put in their claim to a slice of its side for a breakfast relish?a
relish which I assure you is by no means to be despised, particularly
after being a few weeks at sea.
Losing the north-east trade wind and nearing the equator, we
may frequently experience the mortification of being becalmed,
it may be for two or three weeks, which affords plenty of time to
admire the beauty of the tropical sunsets, and renders one par-
ticularly alive to anything that promises amusement. Hence, as
we cross the line, Old Father Neptune?s visit and ceremonies,
although sometimes productive of a little annoyance,
are welcomed with no inconsiderable pleasure.
It is a custom with the passengers, natural as it is wise, to
divide this long voyage into several parts, one of which is, as
will be readily imagined?the equator, or as it is more frequently
termed, the line; and here the distance from home begins to be
specially marked by the absence of old and familiar appearances
in the heavens. The Great Bear and Orion?s Belt have disappeared,
and in their stead strange constellations make their appearance,


the most beautiful of which is the Southern Cross. And now how
lovely are the evenings, and how cheerful and happy are all the
voyagers, displaying a total absence of care. Money and all the
troubles connected with it, have long been forgotten, and every
one from the eldest to the youngest is ready to join in the dance
with which the day is usually closed. On this, the southern
side of the line, the south-eastern trade wind prevails, and
although by its influence we gradually make toward the south,
we at the same time approach very near to the Brazilian coast.
Sometimes in case of water or stores being required, vessels put into
fia |anm
Our object in doing so, will be to introduce to your notice the
remarkably picturesque features which form the entrance to the har-
bour. The rock or mountain which rises behind the outer fort, is
called the Sugar Loaf, and is connected with others almost as
singular in their formation. We here arrive off the entrance of
the harbour, and looking up it, obtain a view of a portion of the
town of Kio Janeiro.
End of the first section of the voyage.


PART 11.
%\t Cape at (toft f ope.
There being no feature of interest between Rio Janeiro and the
Cape of Good Hope, we at once pass to this singular headland,
the southernmost point of Africa, which must be rounded by all
vessels bound to India, Australia, and China. The voyager to Aus-
tralia looks forward to his arrival off this cape with peculiar interest,
for to him it is a kind of half-way house, and as soon as it is
passed, and the vessel?s bows directed eastward, every degree tells
rapidly towards shortening the voyage. The high level mountain
at the back of the town is the Table Mountain ; when the clouds
form and drop like a curtain over its summit, it is called by the
colonists ? the spreading of the table cloth,? and is an indication


of an approaching gale. Vessels lying in the hay immediately
strike their yards and top masts, and otherwise prepare to meet
its violence. The remarkable rock to the right is called the
Lion?s Head, which, from some points, it rudely resembles. Cape
pigeons are found in this and the adjoining latitudes in great
numbers.
In nautical language we now begin to run down our easting,
and, as the prevailing wind here is from the west, and conse-
quently quite fair, we may calculate on making rapid progress.
Amongst other sea-fowl common to these southern latitudes,
we notice that noblest of all aquatic birds, the albatross. To those
acquainted with Coleridge?s wildly imaginative poem, ? The
Ancient Mariner,? it appears invested with a kind of superstitious
interest; but unfortunately for it, that feeling is by no means
universal, for one of the prevailing pastimes on board is, as it is
very commonly called, ? fishing for albatross.? A piece of wood,
to which is fastened a large hook baited with fat meat, is floated
over the stern, the bird being very voracious, attempts to swallow
the tempting morsel, and the hook enters the crooked part of the
beak; the bird is then pulled on to the deck, from which, owing
to the extreme length of its pinions, it cannot again rise.
In a voyage of such length as that to the Australian colonies,
we cannot expect altogether to escape experiencing the effects of
a gale, and it is in this part that we should most probably meet
with it, although, provided the wind be fair and there be plenty of
sea room, our top sails double-reefed, and all made snug, it is
considered to be a matter of little consequence. A vessel running
before the wind, and particularly in a rough sea, rolls fearfully,
and produces the most unpleasant motion one can experience;
besides which, it tests the quality of the cleets and other fasten-
ings of the cabin furniture. Boxes and barrels rushing from their
allotted situations, become quite unmanageable, and the destruc-
tion of crockery is terrific. But the storm abates, and the cry
of ?Whales ahead!? induces passengers again to show their
faces on deck. We are now on


- _ ii IFjjll l|i 11 iiP p |(T' |i I .
Moling immfr,
where from ten to twenty whales may frequently be witnessed
blowing within a mile or two of the ship, in some cases close to
her side. In our present voyage we shall have the good fortune
to see the capture of one of these leviathans of the deep: the
whale commonly taken in these seas is the sperm whale, its head
is enormously large and apparently disproportionate to its body,
and from this head the ?spermaceti? is taken; its lower jaw is
armed with two rows of formidable teeth, with which it seizes its
prey?the squid or cuttle-fish, on which it principally lives. It
has been observed that when the whale is inclined to feed, it goes
to some depth below the surface, and there remains in an oblique
position, opening its vast elongated mouth until the lower jaw
hangs perpendicularly, or at right angles with the body; the tongue
being of a glistening white seems to attract its prey, and when a
sufficient number of squid or other fish are within its mouth, it
closes its vast jaws and swallows the contents.


It is not from tlie sperm whale that the whalebone of com-
merce is taken; this useful substance is a part of the head of the
right whale, found principally in the northern seas. Yast num-
bers of albatrosses and other sea birds are in attendance at the
capture of a whale, and so anxious are they to secure a portion
of the refuse blubber, that they are easily approached by the
sailors, who strike them down with their boat-hooks or with their
oars.
The small island seen in the distance is the
|sM 0f St.
In the Indian Ocean; this being passed, all thoughts, hopes,
imaginings, and conversation, turn towards the new world to
which we are now so rapidly approaching. The seamen are
engaged in scraping the masts and clearing the deck of all lumber;
the cook?s galley is shifted to make way for the chain cable, which,
from the depths below, has again been brought to light. Pas-
sengers? boxes are lifted on deck, and a display of caps, ribbons,
and other finery forcibly intimate that there is an intention
shortly to ? astonish the natives.? A constant look out both from
above and below is anxiously kept; all eyes are now strained
towards the horizon, and many are the disappointments expe-
rienced as the supposed line of coast and mountains dissolve into
vapour. But now strange and beautiful little land birds fly on
to parts of the rigging, masses of sea-weed float by the vessel?s
side, and, marking still more strongly our proximity to the coast,
portions of trees are borne along by the current. At length
the cry of ? Land! ? is heard, and echoed throughout the ship.
We are at the entrance of Bass?s Straits, and the ? Land of
Plenty? lies before us.


PART 111.
gittstralm
The closing scene of the preceding part of the Panorama intro-
duced us to Cape Otway and the adjoining part of the Australian
coast; and, in order that we may not be detained by a succession
of objects in themselves not remarkable for any particular interest,
we will imagine the ship to have entered the Port Phillip Heads,
which are situated at a short distance to the north-east of Cape
Otway, and, after sailing about forty miles in what may be
almost termed an inland sea, to be anchored off Williams Town,
from which place steam-boats are employed to convey the pas-
sengers to Melbourne, about eight miles distant. This part of
Australia has been colonized about seventeen years. The people
who first occupied land here were some of the colonists from Van
Diemen?s Land, who, having received accounts from the seamen
engaged in the sealing-vessels in Bass?s Straits of the fertility of
the country, came over and purchased tracts of land from the
aborigines. Ploeks of sheep were now sent over, and additional
tracts of land were obtained. Then came overland from New
South Wales, numbers of settlers, with their flocks ; and at length
the Government of New South Wales took possession of the
country, annexing it to that colony : it has recently been sepa-
rated from it, and has become a distinct province?Victoria; the
principal town is
IPllflTO,
which place we now visit. In the extreme distance may be
observed portions of land, assuming the appearance of islands.
Near this spot is the entrance from Bass?s Straits into the noble
bay of Port Phillip. The land adjoining the heads or entrance
to the bay, for the greater part, is very low, and consequently, at
.the distance we are from it, does not appear above the horizon :
this will account for the higher parts assuming their isolated
forms. On the inside of the little point jutting into the bay,


in the middle distance, is Williams Town, off which is the
anchorage for all large ships; it is by water about eight miles
from Melbourne. Small vessels and steam-boats can, at high
water, come up the river Yarra Yarra to the wharves imme-
diately under the town.
On the shores of the bay, and behind the wooded hills which
rise near the extreme left of the town, is the picturesque village
of Brighton, consisting principally of very tastefully-built villas
extending about a mile along the coast: being so near the
city (about three miles distant), it has become a most desirable
place of residence for those whose engagements permit them, in
the evening, to exchange the dust and heat of Melbourne for the
refreshing influences of the sea breeze, the enjoyment of bathing,
and those amusements in the way of boating and fishing which
are here amply provided for.
The most comprehensive view of the city is obtained from
Collingwood. The streets cross each other at right angles, are
remarkably broad, and contain houses varying in size, style, and
pretension. The antiquities of the place, however?the lowly
wooden erections, the dwellings of the early residents?are fast
disappearing, and are being replaced by handsome stone build-
ings, which would be a credit to any English town. As a matter
of course, the city contains churches and chapels, literary institu-
tions and schools, flourishing hotels and elegant ball-rooms; and,
for those who are fond of such amusement, there are billiard-
rooms and a handsome theatre. But, in accordance with the best
advice that can be given to the newly-arrived emigrants, not to
be detained by those fascinations which a town life exhibits (and
particularly so after a long voyage), but at once to proceed to the
interior, we also take our leave of Melbourne, and, travelling
eastward, proceed towards the Australian Alps.
The cattle seen approaching the city are portions of the tov n
herd. It is a very common luxury here for a family to keep a cow
for their own use. These cows are entrusted to the care of men
who receive for each animal a shilling a week; and their duty is
b 2


to collect the animals from the bush, drive them in to be milked,
and take them again to their feeding-ground. Through the piece
of marshy land at the right runs a small stream?the ? Salt
Water? River; it falls into the Yarra Yarra, but is not navi-
gable. From the marsh, and extending several miles into the
country on our right, is the chain of ponds or water-holes called
the Mooney Ponds. The country around Melbourne is quite
park-like in character, the trees, which grow at some distance
from each other, being principally gum and sbe-oak trees.
iglmmt flaatom,
which, in the distance, rises abruptly from the surrounding
country, is a portion of the gold-bearing range; indeed, our late
accounts from the colony state that the precious metal has been
found in considerable quantities in this mountain, situated forty
miles from Melbourne.
The wild turkey is frequently seen in this neighbourhood ; it
is a very shy bird, and to capture it the aborigines employ an
ingenious method. Collecting some small branches of the gum-
tree, they form a kind of shield, behind which they stealthily
approach their victim, and seize it by its legs.
The grass-like trees we here pass are she-oaks. As the wind
sweeps through their wiry, fibrous foliage, low musical sounds are
heard, not unlike those of the iEolian harp. Adjoining the fence
which we now approach is another interesting indigenous tree,
the cherry-tree, the peculiarity of which is that the stone grows
on the outside of the fruit. The road before us is very English-
like ; fenced on each side, on some parts with what is termed
post and rail, and on others with the trunks and branches of trees
interwoven. We are now looking over the beautiful
WJfg 0f f eiMbxrff,
through which is seen the windings of the Yarra Yarra. The
house in the middle distance is quite a noble mansion, it is built in
the Elizabethan style, and is the residence of Mr. John Hawden,


A VISIT TO THE GOLD FIELDS. 21
one of the early overlanders from the Sydney country. Leaving
the main road for one of the wild gullies on our way to the river
Groulburn, we come on an
dtonpient of llje Jponpfs,
These poor creatures seldom remain long in one spot, but
wander from place to place as their means of obtaining subsis-
tence on their different camping-grounds fail; their change of
residence is effected with but little trouble?their only valuables
consisting of a few waddies or sticks, spears, and boomerangs.
On night setting in (for they never move after dark), or on
arriving at a situation suited to their purpose, preparations are
made for erecting their huts or gunyahs, such as those before
us ; they are composed merely of a few sheets of bark, supported
by a triangular arrangement of branches, any interstices being
filled up with dried grass or leaves; these- simple habitations
are very rapidly constructed, an hour being sufficient time to
erect dwellings for the whole tribe. Overhanging these gunyahs
are the fronds (or leaves) of the tree fern, which frequently


measure from twelve to fourteen feet in length the tree itself
being from fifteen to twenty-five feet in height. The food of
the aborigines consists of kangaroo, wallaby, opossum, and other
wild animals of the bush, which they either spear or strike
down with the boomerang, or with the waddie. Near the
settlements these animals are becoming much more scarce than
formerly.
We have now arrived at the River Goulburn, which,
rising among the Australian Alps, and fed by their snows, is
a continuously running stream : this is not the case with all
Australian rivers, many of them during the summer months being
a mere succession of water-holes. The River Goulburn abounds
with fine cod and other fish, the former frequently weighing from
forty to fifty pounds ; here are also cray-fish, mussels, and cockles,
the usual productions of the sea, although the river runs twelve
hundred miles before its waters mingle with the ocean near
Adelaide. Wild ducks are very plentiful on this and most of the
rivers in the interior.
0f % iflttltam
now opens on us, and one of those sheep stations which are
justly considered to be the pride of the colony. Morning
breaks, and the watchman, whose duty it has been throughout
the night to keep off the dingoes (or native dogs) and other
destructive animals from the fold, now delivers up his charge
to the shepherd, and the flocks again spread themselves over the
neighbouring hills. The shepherd has to keep his flock together,
and, when necessary, to lead them to fresh pasturage. This
important branch of colonial wealth, ?sheep farming, has been
placed in great danger of late, from the desertion of the shep-
herds to the diggings, hut there is every reason to hope that the
thousands now pouring into the colonies will bring matters again
to their level; and that whilst vast numbers of ardent and ener-
getic spirits will always be found preferring the speculations of
the gold fields, there will be others whose dispositions will lead


them to engage in the less exciting but more certainly remune-
rative pastoral pursuits of the country. Now the scene changes,
and instead of undulating hills, richly covered with vegetation,
and dotted over with flocks and herds, we have nature in her
sterner characters. These are the
Swing Itetoms at
forming the most elevated portion of that great mountain
chain which runs throughout the whole of the eastern coast of
New Holland, a distance of more than 1,000 miles. In various
parts of this mountain range the existence of gold has already
been ascertained.
We now retrace our steps to Port Phillip Bay, and pass
a few minutes in the neighbourhood of Geelong, previous to our
visiting the gold fields at Mount Alexander.
On reference to a map of Australia, it will be seen that, after
entering Port Phillip Heads from the Straits, and proceeding
under some low land for about fifteen miles in a northwardly
direction, we arrive at Indented Head, from which point a deep
bay stretches to the westward, and at the extremity of this bay
is situated the very rising
f Atom Af (Mfing.
This town is of more recent origin than Melbourne, to which
it bids fair to become, at no distant date, a most formidable rival;
it labours under a disadvantage similar to that of the present
capital, in being unapproachable by vessels of a large class,
which are obliged to anchor oft' a point about eight miles from
the town. Between the anchorage and the town of Geelong, a
bar of sand extends across the harbour ; the colonists, however,
confidently expect to be enabled to open a passage through it to
the inner harbour, in which case, the water along shore being
deep, wharves will be built, and vessels of any tonnage will be
brought alongside. The atmosphere of Geelong is cooler, and in
every respect more pleasant, than that of Melbourne, rising as it
here does almost immediately out of Corio Bay, and, being


divided from Bass?s Straits only by a few miles of low land, it
has the advantage of an almost continuous sea breeze. Geelong
is about fifty miles from Melbourne, to which place steam-boats
pass and repass daily. The first dwellings erected on this spot were
the two small cottages which are situated just underneath the cliff;
immediately above them is a recent erection, Atkinson?s Hotel,
quite equal to a first-rate hotel in England. But we must devote
a few minutes to an inspection of the neighbouring scenery. We
are now looking down on the River Barwon, which flows past the
back of the town, and onwards to Bass?s Straits, The country
which rises from it is the Barrabool Hills, acknowledged to be
some of the richest ground in the colony. Exactly in the direc-
tion of the river, and seventy miles from where we now are, is
Mount Alexander. Ballarat, another of the diggings, but which,
since the discovery of the far richer deposits at Mount Alexander,
has been comparatively deserted, is in the same direction, but
only forty miles distant.
Now we again come on Corio Bay, the town is behind us, and
we are looking towards Station Peak, and in the direction of Mel-
bourne. We must not fail to remark those beautiful birds the
Rosella parrots, which, in many parts of Australia, are as plentiful
as sparrows in England. Passing over the country between this
and the gold fields, we shall take a peep at the busy scenes on the
Stoafo to tk Riggings.
What a motley group we have here, men, women, and chil-
dren, bullock drays and omnibuses, masters and their former
servants, some on horseback, others trudging along under the
weight of their necessary tools and implements, and the over-
powering effects of an almost tropical sun; but now they rest
awhile and enjoy their roadside repast, and when the evening
sets in, and the forest tracks are no longer visible, fires arc
lighted, and heartily are the bush luxuries of tea and damper,
and I must not forget the pipe, enjoyed. Horses and bullocks
are tethered and turned into the bush ; saddles become substi-


tutes for downy pillows, and a roll up in a blanket, or, which is
still better, an opossum rug, leaves the comfort of a feather bed
unwished for; the rising sun arouses them from their golden
dreams, and, after another tea and damper entertainment, they
push onwards to the spot in which all their hopes and expecta-
tions are centred. We shall also proceed, and in the next scene
witness the digging and washing of gold at
pamit gleeito.
This gold-bearing district has already been discovered to be
of considerable extent, and to differ very materially in character
from that of the Bathurst Diggings, which we yet have to visit.
Here the precious metal appears to be deposited generally over
the country, and to procure it the diggers sink holes some eight
or ten feet square, and frequently to a depth of twenty or twenty-
five feet; these diggings are in many cases at a distance of four
or five miles from any creek or water-hole: in this case the
earth which has been raised (having in the first place been care-
fully examined with the view of detecting any large pieces of
gold) is carted to the washing-ground. We have selected for
our scene a branch of the River Loddon, in order to witness the
cradling operations. The earth, clay, or sand, which has been
raised from the diggings, is placed in a kind of box at the end of
the cradle, in the bottom of which is a wire-screen ; water is then
thrown into the soil, which is broken and stirred together, the
stones and larger particles being prevented by the screen from
passing through ; these have then to be examined, and it has
not unfrequently happened that diggers at this part of their
operations have been fortunate enough to discover some valuable
nuggets ; fresh supplies of water are then thrown into the cradle,
which is violently rocked, and the lighter portions of the soil are
borne away through the trough. Across the bottom of this
trough are fastened elects, which further tend to detain any
of the heavier particles of matter ; that which remains is then
carefully examined, and again washed in basins.


I
i 26 A VOYAGE TO AUSTRALIA, AND
The little group of aborigines at our right, carelessly looking
on the busy scene before them, causes one to reflect on the singu-
larity of the circumstance, that, although fond to an extreme of
possessing as an ornament any glittering substance, the abori-
gines, as far as we know, have never in their wanderings dis-
covered the precious and most beautiful metal. With this scene
we finish our visit to the Port Phillip, or Victoria, district; and
we now proceed to a most interesting and fertile country, in
the neighbourhood of Sydney,
lUatoarra District.
This beautiful portion of the colony of New South Wales is dis-
tant about forty miles from Sydney; it is surrounded by moun-
tains, and the soil is of a much richer character than that of the
adjoining country. Corn and potatoes are produced in great
abundance, and of fine quality; among tile trees are the cabbage
and other palms, as well as fern trees; beautiful parasitical plants
twine around, and hang in festoons from the trunks of the palms,
giving quite a tropical appearance to the scenery. The sheet of


water before us is called by the colonists Tom Thumb?s Lagoon;
it is very shallow, but abounds with fish, which are frequently
speared by the natives ; other fishers are on the margin of the
lake, pelicans and cormorants, and here are those graceful and
once rare birds, black swans.
We have introduced the aborigines catching wild turkeys and
spearing fish : to give you another idea of their stealthy habits,
we have here a hunting party spearing kangaroos. These
gentle creatures are fast disappearing from the settled dis-
tricts. In the adjoining colony, Yan Diemen?s Land, their
numbers are greater, but even there they are rapidly on the
decrease ; the hinder quarters of the kangaroo are much esteemed
as an article of food, and the flavour very much resembles that
of the hare of this country. The kangaroo, however, is hunted
principally for its skin, with which colonial boots are made.
Moollonpnjj,
the port of the district, now opens on us. From this place the
produce of the neighbourhood is shipped to Sydney; and, besides
small coasting vessels, a steam-boat runs twice a week between
the two places. The hill which forms so prominent a feature in
the scene is Mount Keira, called in the old charts, as named by
Captain Cook, Hat Hill. It would be tedious to take you along
the somewhat uninteresting coast which lies between this point
and Sydney Heads ; but let us say a word or two about a place that
is often talked of, and which is situated on this side of the metro-
polis, Botany Bay, where Cook, in his first voyage round the world,
landed. The name of Botany Bay was given to it from the number
of plants which were there collected by the naturalists forming a
part of the expedition, one of whom was Mr., afterwards Sir Joseph,
Banks. On leaving this bay Cook sailed northward, and it
is related that soon after they had set sail, whilst the great navi-
gator was at dinner in his cabin, a seaman of the name of Jackson,
who was keeping a look-out at the mast head, saw the narrow
opening now termed ? Sydney Heads,? and forthwith announced


? A harbour on the larboard beam.? The intelligence was con-
veyed to Cook, who, being in no hurry to quit his dinner, remained
below till the entrance to the harbour was nearly shut in. It is
farther said that Cook soundly rated the seaman for having given
a false report, whilst the man firmly adhered to his statement.
? Well,? said the commander, with a sneer, ? the harbour shall
be called by your name;? and as ?Port Jackson? it was marked
on the ship?s log, with the additional title of ? Boat Harbour.?
On our late North American provinces declaring their inde-
pendence, and consequently their determination to receive no
more of our convicts, it became necessary for the English Govern-
ment to select some other locality for the disposal of those unfor-
tunate creatures. Cook, it appears, had recommended Botany
Bay as an eligible site for the formation of a convict colony, and
in the year 1786, sixteen years after, it was determined to adopt
his recommendation, and vessels were appointed, under the com-
mand of Captain Phillip, to convey seven hundred prisoners to
the spot selected. After a voyage of eight months, the fleet
anchored safely in Botany Bay, on the 20th of January, 1788.
The unsuitableness of the place for the purpose intended soon
became evident, it being quite unprotected from the prevailing
winds, and the adjoining country consisting principally of swamps
and sterile sand. Captain Phillip determined, therefore, not to
disembark the convicts whom he had brought out, but with some
of his officers and three boats proceeded northward to examine a
harbour which, by Cook, had been named ? Broken Bayon
their way they thought fit to explore the inlet marked in Cook?s
chart as a ? boat harbour,? which, at the time, was satirically called
? Port Jackson.? You will judge of Captain Phillip?s surprise and
delight when, on passing the narrow entrance between the cliffs, the
scene burst on his view which forms the subject of our next picture,
Jffrt Iffdisoih
This view is taken from the north side of the harbour. The
city of Sydney stretches across the middle distance, and on the
several promontories which stretch into the harbour are the villa


residences of the neighbouring gentry. The waters of Port
Jackson are beautifully studded with picturesque islands; the
Paramatta River is seen beyond the city, and forming the extreme
distance are the Blue Mountains, on the western side of which
lie the Bathurst gold fields. The country on this side has
scarcely been interfered with by the hand of man, and, as it may
be interesting to view the country in its original state of wildness,
we shall pass rapidly through one of the romantic gullies
characteristic of the neighbouring scenery, and come out on what
is termed the north shore, and immediately opposite the city,
from which point a view of its various details will be obtained.
Here are a tribe of the natives engaged in one of their wild
and favourite amusements; they term it a corroheree. This takes
place sometimes on the occasion of their meeting a friendly tribe,
and at others to celebrate some victory recently obtained, A fire
is lighted, and kept supplied with fresh fuel by the gins (the
women of the tribe); others, the musicians of the party, in monoto-
nous sounds, shriek out what they call a song, which they accom-
pany by laboriously beating time on their shields with waddies.
Yet, unmelodious and disagreeable as this performance may be to
us, it has a most stirring and extraordinary effect on the black
fellows; they dance and leap around the fire apparently frantic
with excitement, and look much more like a party of fiends than
human beings. But now a subject of a more pleasant description
is before us : this also is the scene of occasional festivities; for
pic-nic parties from Sydney frequently assemble under the shade
of the gum and grass trees, which here add so much beauty to
the spot. We are now at the u Willoughby Falls,? and, although
scarcely two miles from Sydney, we enjoy all the solitude of the
bush. The scene now changes, and
%\)t Cits flf SiikcSt
the metropolis of Australia, is before us. On the 26th of January,
1788, six days after he entered Botany Bay, Captain Phillip
founded the colony, commencing operations at the head of the
cove or bay now marked by the small fort on the left, and


the projecting point of land opposite to us, and named it Sydney,
in honour of the then First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Sydney.
This city is upwards of two miles in extent, and contains a
population of from 60,000 to 70,000 persons. The shops are
handsomely fitted up, quite in the London style.
The Paramatta River now opens on us, and we are on our way
to the Bathurst country. A characteristic incident occupies the
foreground of our picture. A stockman has been collecting and
is driving in cattle. These animals are occasionally permitted
to remain so long in the bush that they become all but wild.
Driving in or hunting cattle is frequently attended with con-
siderable danger, not so much from the cattle turning on the
horsemen (although this has occasionally happened), as from the
rocky and broken character of the country which has to be ridden
over in pursuit of them : none but Australian stock-horses could
keep themselves on their legs; and as for the stockmen, they are
considered to be the finest riders in the world.
We are now pursuing our course to the Blue Mountains, and
here is seen a flock of Emus. This mountain range runs parallel


to the sea-coast, at a distance of from forty to fifty miles, and
gives rise to many rivers which intersect the plains, and run
to the sea. The abrupt gap through which the Nepean River
flows is extremely grand, from the perpendicular height of the
mountain, and the large body of water flowing through so narrow
a channel. It is called ? The Falls of the Weatherboard-hut.?
The road to Bathurst passes over the mountains. Many improve-
ments were made in it by Major Lockyer, and still more important
aid was rendered by Sir Thomas Mitchell. It would be tedious to
show the whole of this road, so we will at once proceed to
?\t Diggings at Swmmciijiti ?m\\,
where the first discovery of gold in this colony was made. The
Turon and Ophir districts are near, and all continue to yield
an extraordinary quantity of the precious metal.

Our journey to the Gold Regions concludes with a
pg|t-st� at % �gljir iigpgJ.
The daily labours are over, and the motley multitude, variously
employed, and surrounding the fires which blaze cheerfully in front
of their tents, form a fine contrast to the stillness of the moonlit
mountains in the distant background. Men, women, and chil-
dren congregate in clusters, and share their only cpuot meal, and,
though an occasional disturbance may be heard, every account
confirms the fact that in all the large gold fields, the dwellers there
are as orderly and well-behaved as the inhabitants of tovns.
