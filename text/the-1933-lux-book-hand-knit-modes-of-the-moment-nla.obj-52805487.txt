A similar pirce of knitting
mashed incorrectly with
ordinary soap. The fibres are

and fit will be quite safe through many
washes if you always use Lux.
Ordinary soap is harmful to wool

SILK GARMENTS
AND STOCKINGS
LAST LONGER AND
LOOK BETTER
if you follow this method of washing
Dissolve Lux in a little very hot water,
then add cold water —one gallon to
three tablespoonsful of Lux. Whisk
into a lather, immerse the articles and
gently squeeze the thick suds through
them. Do not rub. Rinse well in clean,
lukewarm water ; squeeze out water
without twisting. Never dry stockings
near heat—do not iron. Roll delicate
silks in a towel for ten minutes, iron on
the wrong side : never use a hot iron.

SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR GRAFTING
To graft. Thread wool into
wool needle, place the 2 needles
containing stitches together,
right side outside, hold w r ork
so that end of wool is at back
of needle, pass wool needle
through first loop of front needle purl-
ways, but do not slip loop off the needle,
pass needle through first loop of back
needle as if about to knit, but do not slip
loop off. * Slip off first loop as if for
plain knitting in front row, but keep loop
on wool needle until next loop is worked,
pass needle through second loop as if for
purling, but do not slip loop off knitting
needle. In back row, slip off first loop
as for purling, keeping on wool
needle, pass needle through
second loop as for knitting, but
do not slip loop off knitting
needle, repeat from * until all
loops are worked off, fasten off.
Throughout the knitting instructions
when decreasings are made by casting
off, the stitch remaining on the right-
hand needle after the casting off, is in-
cluded in the number of stitches quoted
immediately after.
The asterisks in the instructions denote
the points from which the directions are
repeated.


THESE WASHING HINTS
ARE WORTH MONEY TO YOU
Wrong ways of washing will quickly ruin
valuable garments
How to wash loosely knitted goods
such as jumpers.
Dissolve Lux in a little very hot water,
then add cold or lukewarm water till the
suds are just tepid (three tablespoonsful
of Lux go to a gallon of water). Whisk
into a lather, put in the articles, squeeze
the suds through them, then work about
to expel the dirt, but do not rub. Rinse
well in lukewarm water, squeeze out
water without twisting. Spread to shape
and measurement on a towel and dry flat.
If jumpers are tacked on to a pillow slip
or similar article before washing, they
will not stretch or lose shape.
Artificial silk and mixed fabrics containing
artificial silk.
Mix Lux as above, then put in the
garment and work it gently about in the
suds, handling it very carefully. Rinse
in three lots of clean, lukewarm water,
gently squeeze the water out, but do not
wring. Iron on the wrong side with a
warm iron, never a hot one. Very dainty
garments should be rolled in a towel for
about ten minutes before ironing.
Dull materials should be ironed when
practically dry. Glossy materials can be
ironed when slightly damp.
Coloured and Printed Articles.
If it is suspected that the colour is very
fugitive test a small portion by washing it.
If the suds are coloured then the dye is
not fast, but if the article is washed in
Lux solution which is practically cold,
there will be a minimum loss of colour.
Avoid any soaking, wash quickly, and
dry immediately after the wash. Assist
the drying by squeezing out as much
water as possible, and then remove the
remainder by rolling in a towel for a few
minutes. On no account should articles
that lose colour be allowed to drain as
they hang to dry.
Laces, Lace Curtains, Muslins,
Chiffons and other Line Fabrics.
Dissolve the Lux in a little very hot water ;
add cold or lukewarm water in the pro-
portion of one gallon to three table-
spoonsful of Lux. Whisk the suds into a
foam, then gently work the dainty article
in the solution until it is clean. Rinse in
three lots of lukewarm water ; squeeze
as dry as possible without twisting.
Pin delicate lace out on a flat board to dry.
Roll coarser lace in a towel and iron on
the wrong side while damp, using a
thickly padded ironing sheet.
Gloves.
For wash-leather, crochet, doeskin,
chamois, washable kid and suede gloves,
use one tablespoonful of Lux to each
quart of water. Dissolve the Lux in a
little very hot water. Add cold water
until lukewarm, and stir into a lather.
Put the gloves on the hands and wash
as you would your hands, paying special
attention to the finger-tips. If gloves
are very dirty, use more than one lot of
suds. Rinse in lukewarm water, squeeze
gently, and dry away from a fire, stretch-
ing carefully at intervals.

HOW TO CROCHET
Instructions for beginners
1. CHAIN STITCH (ch) Begin by
twisting the thread around the needle
once, to form a loop, then * throw the
thread around the needle and draw
through the loop. This forms one chain
and is repeated from * for the count or
length desired.
2. SLIP STITCH (ss) Having one
loop on the needle, insert the needle in
the stitch directed, draw the working
thread through this stitch and the loop
on the needle with one motion, thus
making a flat, close stitch.
3. DOUBLE CROCHET (dc)—Having
one loop on the needle, insert the needle
in the stitch directed, draw the working
thread through this stitch, making two
on the needle, then draw the working
thread through these two loops.
4. TREBLE CROCHET (tr)-Having
one loop on the needle, throw thread
around the needle, insert the needle in
the stitch directed, draw working thread
1
2
3
4


through this stitch, making three loops
on needle, draw working thread through
two loops and then through the remaining
two loops. Three chains equal one
treble in measure and in count.
5. DOUBLE TREBLE CROCHET
(dtr) —Is made similarly to the treble,
the difference being that the thread is
thrown around the needle twice and the
loops are worked off two at a time for
three repeats.
6. TRIPLE TREBLE CROCHET (tr tr)
—Has the thread thrown around the
needle three times and the loops are
worked off two at a time for four repeats.
7. HALF TREBLE CROCHET (h tr)—
Having a loop on the needle, throw
thread over, insert needle in stitch
directed, draw working thread through,
draw through two loops, leaving two
loops on needle, * thread over, needle
5
6
7
8

10
in next stitch, draw thread through,
draw through two loops, leaving three
loops on needle, repeat from *, leaving
four loops on needle, then draw thread
through all four loops.
8. HALF DOUBLE TREBLE (h d tr)—
Is made in the same manner, leaving the
last operation of each double treble until
the required number have been made
and then taking off all the stitches at once.
9. PICOTS (p)—Are usually made by a
chain of three or five, then a slip stitch
in the first chain. When there is a varia-
tion of the above, it is specifically given
in the directions.
10. SPACES (sp) —To form a space,
make one treble, then chain two, skip
two stitches of previous row and make
another treble. This should result in a
perfect square, but perfection requires
persistent practice as well as the correct
sizes of needle and thread. For a space
at the beginning of a row, chain five,
which allows three for the treble on the
edge and two for the usual chain two at
top of space.
11. BLOCKS (bl) —Are formed by work-
ing trebles in adjoining stitches for the
required number. Where blocks are
consecutive there are four trebles in the
first block and three trebles in each fol-
lowing block. Therefore, to find the
number of trebles in a row of blocks,
multiply the number of blocks by three
and add one ; in two blocks there are
seven trebles, in three blocks, ten trebles,
etc.
12. BLOCKS AND SPACES This
illustration clearly shows the alternation of
blocks and spaces in filet crochet. Count-
ing from right to left, as the work is made,
there are one block, two spaces, three
blocks, one space. The next series of
blocks is cut off. This would read in
directions, 1 bl, 2 sp, 3 bl, 1 sp.


13. LACET STITCH—Make a foun-
dation chain.
H/ row —Allow three chains for edge
treble, two for two chains and two
more for two skipped stitches,
work a single stitch in the next
chain, * ch 2, skip 2, tr in next,
ch 2, sk 2, ss in next. Repeat
from * for row.
2nd row —Ch 3 for edge tr, ch 5 more,
then tr in tr. * ch 5, tr in tr.
Repeat from * for row. Repeat
these two rows for the pattern.
14. KNOT STITCH (k st)—Having one
loop on the needle, draw it out to the
length of 3 ch, thread over the needle
and draw through, making an ordinary-
chain stitch, drawn out to three times its
normal length. Then put the needle
under that one of the 3 threads of the
long loop which seems to lie by itself,
draw the thread through and make a
single stitch. This is the knot stitch.
It is usually worked by making two, then
fastening to the previous row by a single
stitch unless the row was knot stitch, in
which case work one single stitch each
side of the single stitch between the two
long loops or knot stitches.
15. LATTICE STITCH (lat st)—Work
a chain, then make one knot stitch,
allow three chains for the first treble,
and three for the skipped stitches, work a
tr in next ch, * the knot stitch, sk 3 ch,
1 tr. Repeat for length desired. This
row is repeated for the pattern, working
the tr in tr, each time, bringing the knot
stitches over each other.
16. SHELL (sh) —May be worked with
tr, dtr, or longer, stitches. They are
made up of a given number of stitches
on each half, separated by a given number
of chain stitches. When worked on a
foundation chain, a given number of
stitches are skipped. When worked
over another row of shells, each one is
placed in the chain between the halves
of the previous shell, or between two
shells. In the illustration, the directions
would be as follows ; —Having a chain,
allow 3 for the first tr, two tr in 4th chain
from needle, ch 2, 3 tr in same chain as
last tr, * skip sch ; in 6th ch work, 3 tr,
2 ch, and 3 tr. Repeat from * across
row. Ch 3 and turn at end of row.
Second and all other rows, shell in shell.

and
DURABILITY
Hand-knitted golf-socks both
look and feel right , and they
always last much longer. The
pattern is made interesting by
an unusual design on the turn-
over top.
MATERIALS : 5 ozs. 4-ply Heather
mixture wool; 1 oz. brown 4-ply wool;
a small quantity ot orange 4-ply wool;
set No. 13 steel knitting needles.
o'
MEASUREMENTS : Length of leg
with top turned over IBJ inches. Length
of foot 11 inches. Tension of ribbing, 9
stitches to the inch.
ABBREVIATIONS : K. = knit plain ;
P. =purl; tog.—together ; B=brown ;
X orange.
THE LEG.
Begin at the top of the sock and cast
on 95 stitches in brown wool. Divide the
stitches putting 32, 32, 31 on to the three
needles. Knit loosely into the back of
each stitch in the first round. Work 8
rounds in ribbing 1 plain, 1 purl. Join in
the Heather wool and continue in ribbing.
Work 1 round Heather, 2 rounds orange,
1 round Heather, 3 rounds brown and
then begin the pattern.
PATTERN.
lr/ round —* Rib 188, K. IX, repeat
from * to end of round.
'bid round —* Rib 168, K. 3X, repeat
from * to end of round.
3rd round —* Rib 148, K. SX, repeat
from * to end of round.
4 th round— * Rib 128, K. 7X, repeat
from * to end of round.
In the next 9 rounds keep the 7 stitches
of each pattern in plain knitting and rib
the 12 stitches in between. Work 2
rounds orange, 2 rounds Heather, 1
round brown, 2 rounds Heather, 2
rounds orange. Repeat pattern rounds in
this order : 4,3, 2,1, Then in ribbing
work 4 rounds brown, 1 round Heather,
2 rounds orange, 1 round Heather, 19
rounds brown. Decrease 5 stitches in the
last round, leaving 90 stitches for the leg.
Turn the work inside out and change to
Heather wool.
Work in ribbing 4 plain, 1 purl until you


have done 8 inches with the Heather
wool.
TO SHAPE THE LEG.
Take a purl stitch in the ribbing and
make that the back seam. Knit 2 to-
gether at each side of the back seam in
every 7th round until you have 72 stitches
left.
Knit another 3 inches and then divide the
stitches up for the heel. Put 36 stitches
on to one needle for the heel, keeping the
back seam in the centre of this needle,
and put the other 36 stitches on to two
needles for the instep.
THE HEEL.
Work to and fro on the heel stitches, 1
row plain, 1 row purl, slipping the first
stitch of all rows until the heel flap
measures 2J inches.
TO TERN THE HEEL.
Slip 1, K. 18, K. 2 tog., K. 1, turn.
Slip 1, P. 3, P. 2 tog., P. 1, turn.
Slip 1, K. 4, K. 2 tog., K. 1, turn.

Slip 1, K. 16, K. 2 tog., K. 1, turn.
Slip 1, P. 17, P. 2 tog., P. 1, turn.
You should now have 20 stitches on your
needle. Pick up 18 stitches down one
side of the heel flap. Knit all the instep
stitches in ribbing on to one needle. Pick
up 18 stitches up the other side of the heel
flap and take half the heel stitches on to
this needle.
TO DECREASE.
Ij/ needle —Knit to within 3 stitches of
end of needle, K. 2 tog., K. 1.
2 11 d needle —Instep needle. Work in rib-
bing.
O
3rd needle —K. 1, K. 2 tog., knit to end
of needle.
Decrease in this way in every second
round until there are 18 stitches on each
of the heel needles. There are still 36
stitches on the instep needle. Knit 5
inches, working the instep needle in rib-
bing and the other two needles in plain
knitting.
THE TOE.
needle —Knit to within 3 stitches of
the end, K. 2 tog., K. 1.
2nd needle —The instep needle. K. 1, K.
2 tog., knit to within 3 stitches
of the end, K. 2 tog., K. 1.
3rd needle —K. 1, K. 2 tog., knit to end
of needle.
Knit 4 plain rounds. Decrease in the
same fashion and knit 3 plain rounds.
Decrease again and knit 2 plain rounds.
Decrease again and knit 1 plain round.
Decrease in every round until there are
18 stitches left on the instep needle and
9 stitches on each of the other needles.
Put the stitches from the two back
needles on to one needle.
TO GRAFT THE TOE.
Break the wool and leave a length of
about 16 inches. Thread this into a darn-
ing needle. Begin on the front needle.
* Pass the darning needle through the
first stitch as though you were knitting r
it and slip it off. Pass the needle purlwise
through the next stitch on the same
needle and leave it on. On the back
needle purl the first stitch and take it
off. Knit the second stitch and leave it
on. Repeat from * until all the stitches
are off the needles. Finish neatly on the
wrong side.
Press with a moderate iron and a damp
cloth, being careful to keep the shape of
the sock.

WASH FINE THINGS
AGAIN AND AGAIN
IN LUX
St ill they look like new!
Fine things are seldom worn out ! Most
are made dingy and shabby by washing.
They are actually washed into old age
while they ought to be still fresh and
new 1 It is rubbing with harsh soaps
that damages delicate fibres, mats
fabrics, dulls colours —takes away crisp
newness and shrinks so many garments 1
That is why it is such true economy to
wash fine things—and less expensive
ones, too —with Lux.
Lux is so safe and pure. There is no
rubbing to do with Lux. Its abundant
lather cleanses thoroughly while you
merely press it through the garment.
There’s nothing in Lux that can harm
the fibres of wool or silk, artificial silk
or lace, or anything else. There’s noth-
ing in Lux that can harm colours. That
is why there is nothing so good as
Lux for coloured things. Tests have
proved that garments washed in Lux
stay beautiful —last twice as long.

RICHELIEU
EMBROIDERY
Design by Semco in No. 0 and 4X Flossette.
Richelieu —Work of this sort elves the
o
general impression of being done in
linen thread, but it is really more supple
if embroidery is worked in cotton. The
stitches should be quite close together
and rather tight in order to ensure a
certain stiffness in the bars. The working
of bars in Cut Work should receive
particular attention, as the neatness of
the finished piece depends much on their
proper execution. Take the bars in
Fig. A, which connect the two parallel
lines of buttonholing. Begin to run the
upper line of stamping, and when the
first bar is reached carry thread across to
lower line, take a stitch and then carry
to upper. Then to lower line—thus
giving three threads from line to line for


bar. Now buttonhole bar from lower
line to upper one and proceed to run the
upper line until next bar is reached,
where three threads are laid as before,
and so on. Now run the lower line and
buttonhole both lines, thus completing
the space. Other ways of working the
Richelieu Designs are also illustrated,
showing the effect of long and short
buttonhole stitch in conjunction with
fine Richelieu buttonhole, and the intro-
duction of Guipure bars and woven webs.
ROMAN CUT WORK
Design by Semco in either Flossette,
Stranded Cotton or Coton-a-Broder.
Roman Cut Work —The motifs and all
points of the design in Roman Cut Work
touch each other in such a way as to make
cross bars unnecessary. This is an' open
embroidery, more like carving in effect,
and no attempt is made to suggest lace.
It- is best worked on a nice firm linen.
The designs for this embroidery may be
rather elaborate, since the work itself is
very simple.
It is not shaded in any way, and is very
much on one plane, except for slight
raising of buttonhole outline. All motifs
that form design should be outlined in
run-in stitches, as shown in detail. Fig. B.
Great care must be taken not to draw
these run-in stitches tight, as the work
must be kept perfectly flat. Underlay
the outline of one motif and complete
it before working the next. The
buttonhole work is done over a single
row of run-in stitches, as shown in Fig. B,
and very tightly and closely worked.
The method of working veins in petals
or leaves is clearly shown in Fig. B.
It is not necessary to use very fine working
cotton, but it is necessary to do the work
close. This makes it look fine and firm
and very much richer than if very fine
thread were used.


EYELET WORK AND
SATIN STITCH
Design hj Semco in either Flosseffe
Stranded Cotton or Coton-a-Broder.
Eyelet Work —The samples on this page
show three different methods of working
Round and Oval Eyelets. The left-hand
eyelet shows the outline run, and the
centre pierced ready for working, and on
right side eyelets are shown partly worked.
To work Fig. 1, run round outline, pierce
with stiletto, and overcast.
Fig. 2 is commenced in the same way,
but the edge is buttonholed instead of
overcast, pearl edge inside.
Fig. 3 shows a Wallachian Eyelet; pierce
the centre with a very small hole, then
buttonhole round, pearl edge being out-
side, taking all stitches to the centre.
The Oval Eyelet, Fig. 4, run round out-
line, cut lengthwise, stroke back the
turnings with needle, and overcast as in
Fig. 1.
Fig. 5 shows the pretty Shadow Eyelet.
To do this, first run outline in the usual
way, then run inner line, or (if not marked
on Transfer) pencil one in. Fill in with
run stitches between these lines, cut
centre as shown, and overcast as in right-
hand Eyelet.
Fig. 6 is worked in much the same manner
as Fig. 5, but the edges are buttonholed;
with pearl edge outside.
Satin Stitch —Satin Stitch consists of
placing parallel stitches over a given
design, allowing no break in the surface.
It is not possible to cover large designs
in this way, unless they can be broken
into sections, because the stitches will not
lie well if they are too long. All Satin
Stitch should be padded.

Keep your skin young with
LUX Supercreamed Toilet Soap
NO matter how young you are or how young
you feel you can’t look young if your skin is
beginning to age. And the skin begins to lose
its youthful freshness pitifully soon, now that women
lead such busy lives. Dust and wind, outdoor sports,
powder, rouge, late nights, worry, all take their toll of
youth unless the skin is treated,- every day with some
protective cream.
Keeps away lines and wrinkles
The easiest and surest way to keep youth is to use
Lux Toilet Soap for your twice-daily skin cleansing.
A special skin cream is blended into this fine white
soap and it gives the skin just the right amount of
soothing nourishment to keep it smooth and unlined.
Dainty flower fragrance
Lux Toilet Soap is delicately perfumed with the sweet,
fresh scent of flowers. It leaves the skin refreshed and
just faintly fragrant.
If your skin is sensitive . . .
Take a tablet of Lux Toilet Soap in your hand and look
at its perfect whiteness—only the finest and purest
ingredients could make such a pure white soap. Then
feel the velvety smooth tablet and the soft
creaminess of the lather—-there you have
that is pure and mild and soothing
most sensitive skin.
