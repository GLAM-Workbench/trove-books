PREFACE.
IN calling this little book a History of
Ireland I do not for a moment mean to
suggest that it is a serious history book,
embodying stores of information, and com-
municating new information to the world.
I have not aspired to the writing of an original
book, but what I do wish is to tell in as few
words as may be some of the chief events
which have made the Ireland which we see
to-day.
There are real Irish patriots who would
be glad to know some of the facts of their
country’s history, and who have neither
leisure nor opportunity to seek them out in
books. For such these pages have been
written, and should any read them with
profit they will not have been written in
vain.

CHAPTER I.
THE IRISH TRIBES.
THE earliest inhabitants of Ireland have
left us no history, for Ireland was in-
habited long before people knew how to
write, or to preserve records. Traces of a
very distant age survive, however, and can
be interpreted by those who have made a
study of the subject. The memory of ancient
and long-vanished races still lives in the
songs and legends told by the country people,
and we still find remains of their dwellings,
and some of the knives and other instruments
made of flint, and of other kinds of stone
which were used before the use of iron was
understood. It is thought that amongst the
people in occupation of the country before
the ages when history begins there was a
small race, dark in complexion, and not far
advanced in civilisation. Amongst these
people came invaders belonging to the two
great races of Celts and Teutons.
The original home pf these two races is
unknown, but it is thought to have been
somewhere in Asia. In ages long past great
multitudes of people left their Asiatic homes,
driven forth by hunger, or by other causes
unknown to us, and overspread Europe.
The Celts are thought to have been the first
comers. They took possession of the British


Isles, and apparently of most of the rest of
Western Europe. The Teutonic tribes, re-
lated to the Celts, though differing from
them in many ways, came next. Their great
settlement was in the countries now called
Germany, Austria, Norway and Sweden,
but they sent out colonies into other lands,
and a great many to these islands, and
especially to England. After the Teutons
a third stream of settlers came from Asia—
the Slavs. Their descendants are now settled
in Russia and other parts of eastern Europe,
but as far as we know none of them came as
far west as our own country. Probably
their cousins, the Teutons and Celts, were
strong enough to keep for themselves the
districts they had conquered. The Celts who
came to Ireland appear to have been a much
stronger and more intelligent people than
the races whom they found in occupation
there, and the original inhabitants seem to
have fallen entirely under their dominion.
It is thought that the legends which we still
hear in country places of a little race of people
who live in the raths and duns, and who
come out at night on mysterious errands of
their own, arose first in the days when the
old inhabitants of the country were chased
by the Celts into remote valleys and hiding-
places amongst the mountains, whence they
stole out at night to harry and annoy their
conquerors. In the stories told by the
peasants the inhabitants of the raths are
described as little people, not bigger than
children, and it is very unlucky to speak

any evil of them, as one never knows that
they may not be listening unseen to one’s
words, and storing up revenge in their
hearts for insults bestowed upon them.
The Celts who came to Ireland were not
one united nation, but were organised in
tribes each tribe ruled by its own chief.
After their settlement in Ireland one chief
came to be considered as greater than the
rest. He was called the Ard-righ, the high
king, and he had his palace at Tara. He
was supposed to be supreme over the different
tribes, but, in fact, in each of these tribes
the important person was the chief, and any
man who as a wise counsellor or a brave
warrior had influence with him.
It was amongst these tribes that St. Patrick
preached, and that his followers after him
laboured through many generations to
establish the Gospel. The early Irish Church
was organised in a different manner from
anything now seen in this country. The
bishops did not belong each to a particular
district, as is now the case, but each bishop
belonged to a tribe or to a monastery. The
chieftainship of the tribes was not hereditary
in the sense of passing from father to son,
but it was generally retained in the same
family. On the death of a chief the tribes-
men elected some member of his family to
succeed him, choosing anyone who was
strong, vigorous, and skilful in conducting
the wars which were then exceedingly
common between the different tribes. The
bishop appears to have been elected in the
5

same way as the chief. Bishops and chiefs
frequently belonged to the same family
during many generations. In those un-
settled times it would have been of no use
to build the defencless churches and school-
houses which we now see in every part of the
country.' A few of the ancient Celtic
churches still remain, small, solid and very
plain, but most of the work both of worship
and of instruction seems to have been carried
on in very simple wattled buildings, or in
the open air. The monasteries in which
many of the clergy lived must also have been
slight, simple erections, for no traces of them
remain. In an uncivilised state of society,
and with Pagans yet remaining to be con-
verted, no one would have thought of spend-
ing time and money on buildings which were
only too likely to be destroyed. Even as
late as the twelfth century, when Henry II
kept Christmas in Dublin, a palace of wicker
was put up for him. In spite of its unpre-
tending appearance the Irish Church of the
of the earl}’ centuries gained great glory by
its piety and zeal. St. Columba laid the
foundations of a great missionary movement.
His work lay amongst the heathen in Scot-
land, and, after his time, many missionaries
were sent from Ireland to different European
countries to preach the Gospel in places till
then unreached. At home great schools
grew up around the monasteries, and at-
tracted pupils not only from Ireland, but
from foreign countries, by the excellent
education they provided.

OI/D DAYS AND NEW.


In the ninth century the Irish Church and
Irish civilisation in general received a great
check through the invasions of the North-
men. These Northmen or Danes as they
were also called, were people of Teutonic
race, and they came from the countries now
called Norway, Sweden and Denmark. They
were amongst the last people in Europe to
accept Christianity, and at the time of their
coming to Ireland they were still Pagans.
Here is the account given by an old Irish
writer of the early Danish invasions :
“ There was an astonishing and awfully
great invasion over all Erin throughout its
breadth, by powerful, azure gentiles, and
fierce hearted Danars . . . for the space of
200 years, according to some authorities.
They ravaged her sanctuaries, chieftainries,
and her privileged churches, and they rent
her shrines, and her reliquaries, and her
books. They demolished her beautiful orna-
mental temples, for neither veneration, nor
honour, nor mercy, for termon (i.e., church-
lands) nor protection for church, or sanctuary,
for God or man was felt by this furious,
ferocious, Pagan, ruthless, wrathful people.”
The coasts and estuaries, and, in fact,
any place that could be approached by water
were especially open to the Danish attacks.
The strength of the Northmen lay in their
ships, and during the course of about two
hundred years they succeeded in securing
permanent settlements for themselves in
Dublin, Limerick, and other places on the
coast. The invasions were attended at


first with terrible suffering, but in later ages
Ireland has probably derived advantages
from the fact of having inhabitants of
Teutonic descent. A mixture of races, if
the races are not too widely different from
one another, is a good thing for a country,
as the coming of strangers introduces new
ideas and new qualities, and when peace is
once established between the old and the
new their union tends to the formation of a
vigorous nation.
Other branches of the Teutonic race
allied to the Northmen were at this time
-establishing themselves in other European
countries, and in the north of France a
particularly active and intelligent branch
of the stock called Normans had set up a
kingdom of their own. From France many
came into England and Scotland, and many,
tempted by the success which their Danish
cousins had met with, came into Ireland
about the beginning of the twelfth century.
By this time the Irish Northmen had all
become Christians, converted as it seems,
not by the Celtic Church, but by missionaries
from Northmen settled in other parts of
Europe. Their conversion by missionaries
from a distance and the coming of the Nor-
mans in the twelfth century served to draw
the Irish Church out of the isolation into
which it had fallen in the days of the Danish
wars, and to unite it more closely and
completely with the rest of the Church of
Western Europe.
In 1154 at the Synod of Kells little cloaks

called palls were bestowed by the Papal
Nuncio upon the four Irish Archbishops—a
ceremony never performed before, as till
then the bonds which united Irish Christians
with the See of Rome were of a much looser
kind than was the case later, and the Pope
was not supposed to take any particular
share in the consecration of the Bishops,
who were thought to belong solely to their
own tribal church.
In 1171 another event took place, which,
like the bestowal of the palls, had the effect
of drawing Ireland more closely into the
community of European nations on whose
borders it lies. Henry 11, king of England,
had felt uneasy at the growth of Norman
power in Ireland. He was a man of great
intelligence and force of character, and he
was anxious to build England up into a
strong united kingdom, putting down the
feuds which then divided the English people,
and drawing all his subjects together under
his sway in peace and unity. He saw that
many of the Norman nobles were settling
themselves amongst the Celtic tribes in
Ireland, and he feared that if they continued
in independent occupation 7 of that country
they might introduce feuds, and possibly
strife into the kingdom which he was trying
to create. He therefore watched his oppor-
tunity, and when it came through the
jealousy of two Celtic chiefs, one of whom
appealed to him for help against his enemy,
he went himself to Ireland, and succeeded
in persuading the Irish chiefs to acknowledge
9

him, not as their king, but as their overlord,
as they had formerly acknowledged the Ard-
righ of Tara. Great accounts still remain
of the feasting and rejoicing which took
place in Dublin when the chiefs accepted
the King of England in this new capacity.
Henry was greatly pleased at their acqui-
escence in his wishes in the matter, and every-
one who came to Dublin to pay him homage
was feasted and entertained with great magni-
ficence.
At a Synod, held at Cashel in 1172, it was
determined that the Church of Ireland
should in all points be brought into confor-
mity with the Church of England, as it was
then constituted. The appointment of
bishops was to rest henceforth with the King,
tithes were to be paid for the support of the
clergy, and Peter’s Pence were to be sent
from Ireland to the Pope, These ecclesi-
astical arrangements were carried out at
the special desire of the Pope, who claimed
the sovereignty over all islands, and Bulls
of Adrian IV (an Englishman) and of Alex-
ander 111 gave the temporal power over
Ireland to Henry 11, in consideration of the
Pope’s ecclesiastical claims being enforced.
To be at the head of a well organised and
united church was a great object with the
Popes of those days, who wished it for very
much the same reasons that King Henry
wished to rule a United Kingdom.
And here a few words must be said on the
subject of unity. Some rulers, ecclesiastical
and civil alike, have wished for union amongst
10
OLD DAYS AND NEW.


those under their sway from purely selfish
motives. Kings have wished their countries
to be strong, that they themselves may have
power and exercise authority ; priests have
tried to promote religious observance, in
order to magnify their office, and by means
of their office themselves. Both Henry II
and Adrian IV have been, and sometimes
still are, blamed for their wish to incorporate
Ireland more completely in their dominions ;
but we must remember that for both of them
unity amongst those under their influence
was essential to any real progress. If the
people of England were to have security, if
law was to be maintained, if the great barons
were to be hindered from oppressing the
poor, and from making ceaseless wars upon
one another, if there was to be trade,
education, or security for those who had no
wish to fight, it could only be accomplished
by the maintenance of a strong central
government, which should have power to
dispence justice, and to restrain evil doers.
Without that, civilisation could not be main-
tained, and the country must have returned
to the savage state from which it was slowly
emerging. But for the maintenance of that
strong central government it was necessary
to have a settled and peaceful relation with
Ireland. Had Ireland and England re-
mained totally independent of one another
war must have broken out constantly
between them. Every baron restrained by
the English king from violence and oppression
would have turned to the Norman barons

now settled in Ireland in large numbers
and have sought their assistance, then an
expedition to England would have followed,
and retaliatory expeditions of the English
into Ireland, in which many lives would
have been lost, and great suffering caused
to both islands. Henry II in claiming the
allegiance of the Irish chiefs not only in-
creased his own power as king, but did a
patriotic act, and one which should have
opened a way of peace and progress to Eng-
land and to Ireland alike, had it been con-
tinued by his successors. As for Pope Adrian
his reasons for desiring a more complete
unity than had hitherto existed in the
western Church were even stronger than for
desiring unity in his kingdom. The countries
in the west of Europe were at this time all
nominally Christian, but under the Christian
profession much of the old Pagan spirit
remained. The missionaries of the present
day tell us how long and slow the progress
is from the low ideals and evil habits of
Paganism to the fulness of Christian life. It
is not enough for a nation merely to call
itself Christian. Eong years must be spent
in teaching and propagating the faith before
the traditions of heathenism and the low
standard of heathen life and thought can be
finally eradicated. We know that after
fifteen centuries of Christianity we ourselves
have to be constantly at work building
churches and schools, and organising other
institutions for the maintenance and propa-
gation of the faith, and we often find the
12

work hard to accomplish. In the Middle
Ages the duty of providing churches and
other centres of Christian work for the whole
of Europe amongst lately converted races
and in a very lawless state of society must
have seemed overwhelming indeed. Only
a very strong organisation amongst Christians
could enable the church to attempt to meet
the need, and in drawing the Irish from
their remote corner, to share more fully in
the Church life of Europe the Pope was doing
a good work, and we have no reason to think
that he was not as much concerned about
that as about getting Peter’s Pence and other
advantages for himself. Soon after the
Synod of Cashel King Henry left Ireland,
and, having many other places to visit, was
never able to come there again. His work
of drawing the whole island into unity under
the British Crown was almost entirely
abandoned after his departure, and for about
300 years after his reign two nations in-
habited Ireland —the Celtic tribes and the
Anglo-Normans.
At their first coming the Normans had
driven the tribesmen into the highland
districts, but gradually the tribes recovered
much of the good land, especially during
the wars of the Roses, which lasted in Eng-
land for many years, and weakened the
Normans in Ireland in many ways.
Before the accession of Henry VII the
coast from Dublin to Dundalk, with a varying
district inland, came to be called the Pale ;
it was governed by the Lord Deputy repre-
13

senting the king, and by the Parliament
which sat in Dublin. Even in the Pale the
king’s authority was frequently set at defiance
by the great nobles, but though not very
powerful in fact, he was in that district
acknowledged in name, and the dwellers in
the Pale dressed in the English fashion,
spoke first Norman French and then English,
and were governed by laws framed on the
model of the laws of England. In the rest
of Ireland many chiefs of Norman descent
could hardly be distinguished from the
Celtic chiefs, whose dress, language and
customs they adopted. The feudal law'
which their ancestors had brought into
Ireland with them was never quite forgotten
amongst them, nor was the Brehon law,
which was in force amongst the tribes, ever
quite established, so that they did not con-
tribute much to the establishment of peace
and order in Ireland. The people in the
Pale had a great contempt for all outside
their own borders, considering the clans,
and those who imitated them, as barbarous
savages, while the clans looked upon the
dwellers in the Pale as foreigners and enemies.
Wars were of constant occurrence between
those within and those without the Pale.
At one time it was thought by many people
that the idea of the Celtic tribes having been
little if at all better than savages was right ;
but lately more attention has been paid to
what remains of their literature and their
and it is now the opinion of scholars
that though the clans were behind some of


the more advanced nations of Europe in
learning and civilisation, yet they certainly
were not savages, and though warfare and
violence were exceedingly common amongst
them there was another and more cultivated
side to their lives. They had professional
musicians, singers, and story-tellers amongst
them, doctors and surgeons who had a real
knowledge of medicine, and a regular system
of law and government, which was taught
by professional lawyers and out
according to fixed and well known rules.
The Church at this time was gradually
drawn quite under the Royal and Papal
authority, though disputes occasionally arose
between the King and the Pope, especially
over the question of appointing bishops.
When there was peace between the two the
usual custom was for the King to appoint
the bishop, and for the Pope to confirm the
appointment. As for many generations the
two were generally friends and allies this
method worked quietly on the whole, and
there was no necessity to enquire very closely
into the exact authority possessed by each
in the matter. Occasionally a dispute arose
as to whose authority must give way, when
the Pope and King could not agree on the
same candidate, but these disputes always
ended in agreement, till the unhappy divi-
sions of the sixteenth century.
Ireland in the Middle Ages was not, and
made no attempt at being, a united country.
Disputes were incessant between the Celtic
chiefs ; between the chiefs and the people


of the Pale ; between the people of the Pale
and those who were supposed to have autho-
rity over them. No effort was made by
anyone to reconcile these differences, or to
bind these disjointed elements into one
united people.


CHAPTER II.
THE PLANTATIONS.
THE policy of making Ireland one was
first seriously entertained by the Sove-
reigns of the House of Tudor, who reigned
in the end of the fifteenth and through the
sixteenth century. They did not wish as
we do, to draw all the elements of Irish life
into one vigorous whole, but they did wish
to make the authority of the Crown supreme
everywhere, and to establish one law for the
whole island. It was an idea which might
have borne good fruit for Ireland had they
carried it out by right means. The Tudor
Sovereigns were Henry VII, Henry VIII,
Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth. The last
three were children of Henry Vlll,and grand-
children of Henry VII. As a family the
Tudors had points of resemblance with
Henry 11. They were people of strong
character, and were bent on making their
country united, powerful and independent.
As a means to this end it was part of their
Irish policy to put an end to the rule of the
chiefs, and to bring the whole country under
the authority of the Government in Dublin.
Henry VIII was the first sovereign to assume
the title “ King ” of Ireland, instead of Lord,
and he and his children tried to establish
absolute authority over the whole island,
and over every person therein. They carried


on vigorous war against all who opposed
them, and, not content with driving the clans-
men away from the Pale, they pursued them
into their own territories, and never rested
till the hostile clans were completely broken
up, their chiefs dead or banished, and the
tribesmen reduced to complete submission
and helplessness. Gradually this policy pre-
vailed, and the old order of things came to
an end. The clans ceased to exist, the
Brehon Taw was forgotten, the old Irish
dress was abandoned, and one system of law
and one form of government prevailed
throughout the island. This change has not
been without its good side. Ireland is too
small an island to support two nations.
When it has done so strife and disorder
without end have been the result, and yet
the story of the wars by which the old system
was destroyed and the new introduced are
so terrible that as one reads it one wonders
how any good could follow on what to this
age seems such barbarous cruelty. Under
Elizabeth’s generals whole districts were
devastated, and sometimes left without a
single surviving inhabitant. In some places
the clansmen were hunted down like wild
beasts, and whole populations were put.to
death, neither women nor children being
spared. Besides those killed in war un-
numbered multitudes perished of hunger and
disease ; ruin and desolation were spread in
all parts of the island, and places which
according to the ideas of the age had been
prosperous and well peopled were left with


out cattle or inhabitants. These were
not wars of religion, though it was at this
time that the religious schism began which
endures amongst us still. We are told that
in Elizabeth’s armies there were many Roman
Catholics and also many Irish soldiers
who helped in the work of destroying their
countrymen.
In whatever manner accomplished the
breaking up of the clans who had for so many
ages occupied the land, must have been
attended by great loss and suffering. The
process as carried out was made more difficult
by the religious strife which broke out in
Europe in the sixteenth century. The
history of the religious struggle as it took
place in Ireland is well known. Henry VIII,
Edward VI and Elizabeth took the contrary
side to the Pope in the disputes then raging ;
Mary differed from the rest of her family,
and was on his side.
Some of the bishops then in possession of
the Irish Sees accepted the Book of Common
Prayer, and separated from the Pope. Their
successors in Ireland at the present time are
the Protestant bishops. When it became
evident that the breach was permanent and
that re-union was not to be looked for the
Pope consecrated fresh bishops for all the
Irish dioceses, and from these the present
Irish Roman Catholic bishops trace their
succession. Both the Roman Catholic and
the Protestant Church claim through their
bishops to be one with the Irish Church of
the early ages.
19
A HISTORY OF IRELAND.


The Government in Queen Elizabeth’s
reign took little trouble to explain the side
of the controversy which it had adopted to
the people in Ireland. There were no means
of printing the Bible and Prayer Book in
Irish till after the schism was complete.
The Government was, in fact, unwilling to
circulate any book in that language, and
orders were given when the reformed services
were introduced into the Churches to read
them in Eatin in places where the people did
not understand English. Meanwhile the
Jesuits and other adherents of the Pope were
very active in explaining their side of the con-
troversy to the Irish-speaking people, and by
this means the clansmen were drawn to the
Pope’s side, and alienated from that sup-
ported bv the Government. Thus at the
very moment when with such pain and loss
the division of race was being done away
with in Ireland, the division of religion was
beginning. This division is unhappily not
healed yet; but we should never cease to
hope and to pray for the day when truth
shall be more widely accepted than it is at
present, and when all Irish Christians shall
again be united as were their ancestors in
one undivided Church.
Under Queen Mary —Henry VIII’s. elder
daughter—the policy of making plantations,
as they were called, was introduced into
Ireland. When a tract of country had been
depopulated in the wars it was thought good
policy to introduce English people, well
affected to Government, and to settle them


on the land left vacant. The first plantations
were made in districts conquered from the
O’Mores and O’Connors, and the districts,
thus settled were called Queen’s County,'
with its capital Maryborough after Queen
Mary, and King’s County, with its capital
Philipstown, after King Philip of Spain, her,
husband. Had this policy been carried out
with sufficient care it might have answered
very well. If the settlers had been carefully
chosen, and only allowed to go over if they
knew some useful trade, or had other means
of helping on civilisation they might have
been very useful; also if they had only been
allowed to settle on lands really left vacant,
or honestly bought, few would have com-
plained of their coming. Unfortunately, in
too many cases, both these precautions were
neglected. Adventurers of all sorts were
encouraged to go to Ireland, people went
to seek their fortunes, and soldiers who had
been engaged in the wars settled on the land
they had conquered. All that was asked
in a settler in a plantation was that he should
be well affected to Government, and, in the
case of the later plantations, that he should
be a Protestant. Also in a great many,
cases people were violently and unjustly
turned out of their lands to make space for
these newcomers, and this led to terrible
suffering and very great ill-feeling. The
rebellion of 1641 was in great part caused by
the desire of the former occupants to return
to lauds from which they or their fathers had
been expelled. The strife and bloodshed which
21
A HISTORY OF IRELAND.


occurred at that time are not quite forgotten
in Ireland yet. The principal plantations
were carried out by Mary Tudor, Elizabeth,
James I, Oliver Cromwell, and William of
Orange. In some cases whole populations
were introduced into Ireland, in others the
cultivators of the soil were left untouched,
and only the principal men were replaced
by new masters from England or Scotland.
In spite of much suffering caused at the
time the plantations cannot be said to have
failed. As has so often happened before
strangers were brought in great numbers to
Ireland, and though the manner of their
introduction was at times cruel, the national
life has undoubtedly been enriched and
strengthened by the new elements which they
and their descendants contributed to it, and
many of those descendants have been good
patriots, and devoted themselves whole-
heartedly to the welfare of Ireland.
The House of Tudor was succeeded on the
throne by the House of Stuart. The fourth
and last Stuart King was James 11, who
brought about the ruin of his family, and,
for the time being, brought about the ruin
of Ireland also. James II thought that a
king is superior to law, and may dispense
with it when he pleases. This idea lay at
the bottom of his difficulties with his English
subjects. In 1688 these difficulties were
such that he fled from Eondon, leaving his
throne to be occupied by his daughter Mary
and her husband William of Orange. Having
reached France in safety it would, have been


well if he could have remained there ; but
it is no doubt hard for a man who has once
been a king to give up all hopes of reigning
again. His friend and protector Douis XIV
also urged him to make an attempt to re-
cover his throne. Douis had long been at
war with William of Orange, and thought
that to support the claims of his father-in-
law was a good way to injure him. The
attempt was made in Ireland, as James
hoped that the fact of his being a Roman
Catholic would win him adherents amongst
the Irish, and, unfortunately, it did, for
James was as feeble as a soldier as he had
been unwise as a king, and he did not prove
worthy of the energy which the Irish threw
into his cause. James landed at Kinsale in
March, 1689, and came thence to Dublin,
where he held his court for more than a year.
The famous Seige of Derry took place during
this time, the town being besieged by the
Jacobites, and relieved by King William’s
troops on July 31st, 1689. The following
year William came himself to Ireland. He
landed at Carrickfergus on June 14th, 1690,
and advanced towards the south. James
marched north from Dublin, and the two
armies met on the banks of the river Boyne
on June 30th. 1690. The next day the
battle of the Boyne was fought, and a com-
plete victory gained by William. The
Jacobite army was smaller and less well
armed than William’s, and it was considered
that Jaraes had not commanded well or made
the most of his position. “ Change kings


ami we will fight it over again with you,”
was the remark said to have been made by
the Jacobite general Sarsfield. The French
officers; who commanded under James did
their best to draw off the troops in the
evening) and James himself arrived late at
night amongst his friends in Dublin. It
shows what they must have thought of him
that they united in urging him to return to
France to his friend Kiug Louis, evidently
feeling that his presence would hinder
rather than help them in their future re-
sistence to Kng William. James took their
advice and taking ship for France never saw
Ireland again. His troops fought without
him better than such a king deserved, and in
spite of the defeat of the Boyne rallied again
and prolonged the war under French leaders
for more than a year, till their hopes were
finally ended by the battle of Aughrim and
the surrender of Limerick, in September,
i6qi. After the war was over the last
great introduction of strangers took place
which has been seen in Ireland, many of
James’s adherents being banished or going
willingly abroad sooner than acknowledge
the new king, while their lands were given to
adherents of William.

CHAPTER III.
A UNITED IRELAND.
THE years which have passed since William
of Orange came to the throne have
seen the birth and the first slow progress of
the idea of a United Ireland. This idea may
be said to have been born in that period,
for there never has been a time when the
idea of one Ireland, large enough to compre-
hend different elements, and strong enough
to blend them into one united and vigorous
whole was as strong in the world as it is
at present. Such an idea could not arise
amongst the Celtic tribes, for the thought
of a nation containing different elements,
and existing by uniting them, is one which
does not belong to society in its tribal stage,
as the aspirations of tribesmen do not gener-
ally go beyond their own tribe. From the
time of the setting up of the Pale too much
alliance between those within and those
without it was welcome to no one, and during
the convulsions of Tudor times Ireland might
seem a battlefield or a land open for the
schemes of the adventurous, but it was not
a place where circumstances favoured the
quiet growth of patriotism. The vision of
a united Ireland began to arise in the eight-
eenth century. It has been growing and
developing ever since. When we remember
this it should encourage us not to be too


much downcast if things appear to be going
very badly, for certainly at the beginning of
the seventeenth century, and during the
reigns of William and Mary, and of Queen
Anne who succeeded them, the union of all
Irishmen for the good of their country
seemed as far off as it had ever done before;
The distinction of race was gone—all were
acknowledged as equally subjects of the
sovereign, but the idea of separation was
still carried on in the laws connected with
religion. Religious distinctions had existed
in Ireland since the days of Elizabeth, and
laws been passed from time to time restricting
the liberty of Roman Catholics in many ways,
and especially interfering with the public
exercise of their worship, but these laws
have never been generally put into execution,
and had at times been allowed to lapse
altogether, but during the reign of Queen
Anne laws were passed which dealt with
religious differences in quite a new way, and
which inflicted injuries on the country from
which it has not fully recovered even yet.
The famous penal code was not all passed
at once, but at intervals during the reigns
of William and Mary, Anne, George I,
George II and George 111. While the code
was in full force it was against the law for
Roman Catholics to be barristers or solicitors,
to hold any civil or military post, or to be
members of a corporation. It was illegal for
Roman Catholics to teach schools, or to send
their children abroad for education ; they
were not allowed to carry firearms, or to


take more than two apprentices in any trade,
except the linen trade, which the Govern-
ment wished to encourage. There were
many restrictions to hinder them in buying,
hiring, bequeathing or inheriting land, they
were disfranchised, and oaths were required
from members of both Houses of Parliament
which made it impossible for them to sit
in either. The Roman Catholic clergy were
only allowed to be in Ireland in small num-
bers and under great restrictions. How far
this code was put in practice is a matter of
research amongst historical students. In
such a country as Ireland then was with
few roads, few posts, no police force, and a
large population devotedly attached to the
Church of Rome, the provisions of the penal
code cannot have been fully carried out ;
but enough was done to make the life of
Irish Roman Catholics uncertain, and to
discourage many lawful kinds of activity
amongst them. The worst and most lasting
effect which these laws have had is that
they have created a tradition of hostility
between the people and their rulers. The
idea was at one time strong in Ireland that
the Government was the enemy, and that
those who wished to help the people must
be prepared to defy the law. This hostility
to the law and the Government has no doubt
been weakened of late by wise legislation,
but it exists in some measure even yet, and
it is altogether an evil spirit, and one which
ought never to have characterised the Irish —
a people capable of great loyalty and not


naturally inclined to set themselves against
lawful authority.
The penal laws were passed in Ireland at
a time when the bitterness between different
denominations was very violent, not only
in Ireland, but in the whole of Europe.
At that time all European states had laws
prescribing penalties against those who re-
fused to conform to the State Church, and
some of these laws were more cruel than the
laws in Ireland. But a change came over
men’s minds. Compared with the seven-
teenth centffry the eighteenth was a time of
peace, and in many countries there was
leisure for thought and study. As a con-
sequence of this more enlightened ideas
began to prevail. In the later years of the
century the idea of religious toleration be-
came gradually popular in many countries
and took hold of many people in Ireland,
both in and out of Parliament. The Irish
Parliament in those days was a body little
like any assembly of the present time. It
was elected by a small number of Protestant
voters —its members being all Protestants—
and many of them held office under Govern-
ment, and were directed by the Government
how to use their votes. In this assembly
arose a party of liberally minded men, who
made it their object to obtain full civil rights
for their Roman Catholic fellow-countrymen.
Of these the chief was Henry Grattan. He
became a member of the Irish Parliament
in 1775, at the age of 29, and from that time
till his death, in 1820, he devoted himself


unceasingly to the removal of Irish grievances
and the improvement of the Irish consti-
tution. He thought that imperfect as it was
the Irish Parliament might, if reformed and
to some extent remodelled be an instrument
of great good in Ireland, and through his
exertions its constitution was changed in
many ways. It was made more independent
of the Parliament at Westminster, and if
Grattan could have had his way all classes
of Irishmen would have been gradually ad-
mitted both to vote for its members and to
occupy its seats. Two great relief measures,
as they were called, were passed by the re-
constituted Irish Parliament for the removal
of parts of the penal code. They even went
so far as to enable Roman Catholics to become
voters, but the final measure of allowing
them to become members of Parliament
was more than even Grattan could accom-
plish. The measure was one to which the
King of that time, George 111, had taken a
violent dislike, and he persisted in his op-
position in spite of the advice and warnings
of many of his ministers. To the Roman
Catholics, watching eagerly for the granting
of their full civil rights, and to Protestants
and Roman Catholics, watching alike!Tor
much needed reforms on many subjects!,
the measures of relief seemed to come very
slowly. The insurrection of 1798 broke out
because the people lost patience, and tried
to win by force of arms what came to them
afterwards through years of patient hard
work by all their friends. The Government

A HISTORY OF IRELAND.


had information through informers of the
intended rising, before it took place, and
all the leaders were arrested. The people,
however, rose on the day appointed, following
the directions of such men as volunteered at
the moment to lead them. The original
intention of those who planned the rising
had been to unite all classes of Irishmen in
a demand for what they considered necessary
reforms for the whole country, but with the
leaders in prison, the insurgents who were
found in all the eastern counties both of
Ulster and Leinster were unable to keep to
the original purpose, and at the end the
rebellion degenerated into savage party war-
fare, Protestants and Roman Catholics att-
acking one another with a fury which almost
recalled the spirit of the seventeenth century.
The rebellion was put down after a short time
by the soldiers, with great violence and
cruelty, and when peace had been restored
it was the opinion of many people that the
time had come to draw closer the bonds which
united Ireland and England, and to have a
union on the same plan as the union which
had been arranged some years before between
England and Scotland. The proposal was at
first strongly opposed in Ireland, especially
by the Protestants, but their opposition
was overcome, largely as is now believed by
the distribution of bribes. The Irish Parlia-
ment consented to its own extinction, and
met for the last time in 1800. Since then
Ireland has been represented in the Imperial
Parliament by 103 members in the House


of Commons, and 28 Peers in the Housfe of
lyords. The Roman Catholics were on the
whole favourable to the Union when it took
place, as they believed that their emanci-
pation would follow immediately, as it would
have done had it been possible to overcome
the objections of the King. This was, how-
ever, found impossible, and all that could
be done was to prepare the way for the
granting of full civil rights in another reign.
Grattan, who had been strongly opposed to
the Union when it was first decreed, refused
at first to sit in the Imperial Parliament.
In 1805, however, seeing that the Union was
accomplished, he resolved to make the best
he could of it, and he sat first for an English
constituency and then for Dublin. He
continued to work steadily for the Roman
Catholics, explaining their case to people
in England, and helping in the preparation
of petitions which were presented again and
again to keep the matter in the recollection
of Parliament. Grattan’s devotion to this
work was the immediate cause of his death.
His health had been failing through the winter
of 1819-20, but he was determined to be in
his place in Parliament after Easter, to
present the Roman Catholic petition. The
doctors warned him when the time came that
he was not fit for the journey, but Grattan’s
only reply was that he must be there. An
address was presented to him from the Dublin
Roman Catholics begging that he would put
off the journey, and let the petition wait till
his health should improve. In his reply,


which he knew was his farewell to them, he
begged them and all the Roman Catholics
-to maintain a perpetual connection with the
British Empire, to keep clear of every
association “ with wild projects,” and to
accept of emancipation “ upon terms that
are substantial and honourable.” He told
them that “ he Still intended to go to England
for their question,” and should the journey
cost him his life, “he would be more than be
repaid by the reflection that he made his
last effort for the good of his country.” He
went from Dublin' to Eiverpool, and from
Liverpool to London by boat along canals,
as he could not bear the motion of a carriage.
At Stony Stratford a few miles from London
his illness increased so much that it became
evident he had but a few days more to live.
But he felt that he had done his utmost, and
he was satisfied. He said, “If I cannot
’■speak for the Catholics I can pray for them.”
-He reached London bn the 31st May, and
died there on the 4th June.
Grattan was succeeded as leader of the
Protestants favourable to the granting of
emancipation by William Plunket, after-
wards the first Lord Plunket, who carried
on the work of overcoming Protestant
opposition to the measure. At this time the
Roman Catholics themselves produced a
champion for their cause, Daniel O’Connell.
He promoted a great and most orderly
agitation in Ireland, by which in lawful and
right ways the Irish Roman Catholics were
enabled to express their strong wish for full


civil rights. Nine years after Grattan’s
death his hope was fulfilled, and in 1829
O’Connell sat as member for Clare in the
Imperial Parliament.
The events which have followed the grant-
ing of civil rights to the Roman Catholics
come within living memory, and may be
said to belong to contemporary history.
They must be dealt with in a few words.
Two great questions have agitated Ireland
luring the nineteenth century, the repeal
of the Union and the alterations of the Rand
Raws. On the subject of the Union Irish
opinion has changed during the no years
of its existence. When O’Connell tried to
rouse the country in a united effort for repeal
he found that the very classes which had
been least favourable to the Union in 1800 —
the landed gentry and those connected with
trade—had become strong Unionists. They
held the opinion that Ireland had prospered
under the Union, and had nothing to gain
by its repeal. In this attitude they have
remained ever since. Neither O’Connell nor
Isaac Butt, nor C. S. Parnell could persuade
them to the contrary, and though they are
now in a minority on the subject their
oposition to what used to be called Repeal,
and is now Home Rule is of such a character
that the Home Rule Bills introduced into
Parliament, one in 1886 and one in 1893,
have both been lost, one in the House of
Commons and one in the House of Uords.
But though Home Rule has not been given,
a wider circle of Irish people are now in


charge of Irish affairs than was formerly the
case, partly through the institution of the
County Councils, partly through the organi-
sation of the Department of Agriculture,
which now takes such a large share in the
life of the country, and whose governing
body is partly elected by the County Councils,
which are elected by the ratepayers.
The questions connected with the land in
Ireland are of a very technical kind, and are
far harder for ordinary people to understand
than is the question of Home Rule. Nearly
everyone with any practical experience in
Ireland feels competent to defend or to
attack the Union, comparatively few can
explain the land legislation of the last fifty
years, even to their own satisfaction. To
understand the question properly one would
have to know the rules not only of Irish
land tenure but of land tenure in one or two
other countries with which to be able to
compare it. But without going very deeply
into these mysteries it may be said that at the
time of the Union, and for fifty years later,
Irish landlords had much power over their
tenants, and some legislation for the pro-
tection of the tenants was needed. After
many changes in the Land Raws and much
discussion of the subject during more than
half a century, well-informed and patriotic
Irishmen seem to agree in thinking that the
best plan at the point we have reached now,
is not to amend anything further in the
relation of landlord and tenant, but to bring
the relation itself to an end. The plan


embodied in the latest of the Land Acts
(the Wyndham Act, 1903) is that the State
should pay to the landlord who wishes to sell
the value of his land, and that the tenants
should pay a yearly rent to the State, till the
money advanced has been repaid, after which
the holding will belong to those who were once
the tenants. This plan is being carried into
effect on many estates, and would be carried
out on many more, were it not that it re-
quires a good deal of money to buy out the
landlords, and that even Governments require
time in which to raise large sums of ready
money.
When we look away from politics we can-
not doubt that socially the state of Ireland
has improved wonderfully of late years.
The people live in better houses than they
once did, they eat better food, they have
more money in the savings banks. Edu-
cation, though still behind that of some
countries, is spreading year by year, and for
the first time definite efforts are being made
to improve the agricultural education, which
is of such vital importance to an agricultural
country like Ireland. Efforts are also being
made to develop industries of all kinds, and
as a result of this lawful activity party spirit
is diminishing.
No doubt traditions die hard ,and one
is sometimes tempted to think that the bad
traditions die hardest. There are, and
perhaps there always will be, a certain num-
ber of people in Ireland who seem to take a
pleasure in promoting strife and ill-will, but


there are signs that such people do not find
the work of making quarrels quite as easy
as they once did. Let us hope that a little
conversation repeated to the writer of these
pages may be characteristic of the age.
“ Did you hear all I had to tell about the
evil deeds of the Irish landlords ? ” said a
man to his neighbour. “ Did it not take me
a long time to tell it all ? ” “Yes,” said the
neighbour, “ and you would have been
longer still telling all their good deeds.”
Ireland as it is does still come very far
short of Ireland as it ought to be. Let us
sometimes compare it with Ireland as it
was in past ages. If we do that in a sober
and reasonable spirit we shall see very great
reason to be thankful to God who has brought
the country through so much that was wrong
in the past, who offers so much that is good
in the future if Ireland’s children will rise
to the greatness of their opportunities.
